B008KWHKGM|5.0|The 1st listen was lack-luster. The 2nd caught my interest and now I love it.  Simple but rich. Going to see them live tomorrow.
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|I liked half of this book, when it was the boys POV time. The girls were sooo heavy on the relationship parts that I just skimmed their parts. I get it's written for teenagers, but I'm about 3 years out from teenage years and I never was this bad. It took me a week to finish this book, when it usually only takes part of a day. Given that I still would recommend the book.
B002SAUCBC|5.0|A great read as always with Stephen King.  My favorite author.  Love his style of writing.  Loved the story and the price was affordable.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I was reading this book as I was working and traveling extensively but could hardly wait to get back to it each night. I have read better in the past but there is not much better than a Stephen King story. This will go on my better read list.
B006HTUZ1C|2.0|Pretty good game.  Dont like the chatter but I could handle that..  Its sort of tetris like but not quite.  An adequate addition to my collection.<br /><br />I havnt deleted it yet.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|I ordered this from the Uk as I much prefer the 'digibook' style packaging of the US version. Beautiful PQ and AQ on all these movies. Raiders looks stunning. The new documentary concerning Raiders is also a real treat. Highly recommended.
B001C08RHA|3.0|Bought this item as gift.  So cannot make a comment on this item at this time.  But the price was right.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|I want my wife to read it and she doesn't like violent or gross books.  This book is written in way that doesn't lose the intensity but it isn't so detailed that it will affect your supper.  Now if you use your imagination it could...
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|Background music is pleasant and graphics are good. I would definitely recommend adding this to your game library. Samsung 7 inch Tab 2
B009329ZF2|4.0|This movie was Entertaining. Brooklyn Decker fans will appreciate her form and figure. Acting and content and appearances by many provide one hundred and six or so minutes to repeat over and over.

B006OCM0G0|1.0|I got this app I played it for like 5 minutes and then got board. DO NOT GET THIS APP.  you will regret it
B008MG1E4A|5.0|A very interesting story that needed to be told. Usually such first-hand-accounts never see the light of day till years after the events. Thankfully this one did not. The author strikes a balance between presenting a great story and not overwhelming the non-military reader with tons of jargon. You get to understand what it takes to get to the position that he reached in his military career, and why we need people like him in our military. The mission is discussed in detail yet not to the point of giving away classified information that can be used against us. Considering all the variations of what America was told of this event, it was good to hear it from someone that was there and that doesn't have a political axe to grind.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|First off, I am a Isaacson fan and have enjoyed his past biographies. This one may not have the level of depth that some uber-fans will like, but it is well written to reveal the troubeld genius that changed the way we all view media. His ethics and tactics are questionable at times, but no one can doubt the passion with which he steered Apple and Pixar.<br /><br />A good read and definitely recommend to any that want to know more about the wiley Steve Jobs.
B001GZ6QC4|5.0|Just loved this movie.  Great entertainment.  Great action.  Great storyline.  An affordable price.  Looking forward to more of the same in future Batman movies.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|The premise of the soon to be released movie of a young man and a wild Bengal tiger stranded at sea on a life boat  is what caused me to read this.  I like to read the books before I see a movie to judge how well the screen play measures up. I can hardly wait to see this movie. I was scared and amazed at every hardship and brilliant solutions that the young man \\"Pi\\" discoverd. How would you survive and not be killed and eaten by a 400 pound wild tiger under this horrific circumstances? Pay close attention to the ending. It will blow your mind.
B007THA4FI|5.0|This is well written, expertly plotted and stays with you long after it ends. The 1 star reviews here focus on the fact that it is not like Harry Potter. I thought it was made pretty clear this is an adult novel and is not suitable for kids.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Flow is addictive. the minute I picked it up, I couldn't put it down. if you're looking for a game that'll keep you busy for a while, this is it.
B005SFS4ZU|4.0|Of course the performances, staging, orchestra, etc. we're absolutely incredible. I only wish they had taken into account the HD camera close-ups.<br /><br />Phantom's mask and especially his makeup, were so distracting, I had to make an effort to ignore them. The makeup was designed for a theater audience, so it was made to be extra grotesque so members of the audience could tell that he was disfigured. But, let's face it, this elaborate staging would never have been done if it wasn't for the tens of millions of people who would be watching on TV and DVD.<br /><br />Phantom's makeup should have been made a lot more subtle for TV. It looked like a really bad 50s horror movie. And it was really gross. The mask was also horrible. It fit as if it were made for another actor.<br /><br />Everything about this massive budget production was designed for the HD cameras. How could they have ignored Phantom's mask and makeup, using the same methods and technology that they used 25 years ago?
B00003CXWV|5.0|I know it's been a few years since I ordered it but, still this movie came in perfect condition and within the time frame that we expected. My husband LOVES this movie.
6304806418|5.0|Short and sharp:  Great music, great acting, and highly entertaining!  I never thought Antonio Banderas could sing like that!  Madonna is just superb in this movie!  Bravo!
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest is so much fun! I love goin on it and seeing all the creative new ways to do things! I especially love the humor page! Its great if you ever want a good laugh!
B002N5N5QQ|5.0|I love sons! Movies played and looked good. Great value! Very happy with this purchase. Received my order pretty quick.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|fun and addictive game. challenging but not too hard to enjoy. cool tools to help unblocked certain tiles. one of my fab match three games.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Reading Gone Girl is like watching a sleight of hand magician as the plot twists and turns.  I kept wondering whether it was supposed to be an exaggerated metaphor for the shadow side of marriage in general or a morality tale about how treating people as property or fantasies of our own making can lead to lies and abominations.  The ultimate depravation of the characters, Amy (as in Amazing Amy of the children's books that made her family wealthy), and Nick, the magazine writer who loses his job,  who seemed so hale and hearty on the surface, gave me cause to reflect on the ability in our time to ignore virtue and pursue self-interest through a labyrinthine path.  The story moves from infatuation of two self-aware and articulate yuppies  through the erosion of their fortunes,  their desperate resettlement from Manhattan to Nick's Missouri home town to build new lives, the difficulty and boredom of making a new life, infidelity, vengeance, and after the ruse of Amy's abduction and eventual reappearance, to their acceptance of themselves and one another.  It was a story of mutual manipulation and cunning, traits of the author as well as the characters, to which I sucombed entirely as i could not put the book down.
B005S9EJ14|1.0|I looked forward to a pleasant movie to enjoy. Instead I was turned off completely after the first few minutes. One never got a good grasp of who these people were to begin with, and how they got hooked into going to the hotel was all very fuzzy. Suddenly they are all together on a plane for India. The background noise is loud and ugly and one simply wishes for it to cease. Their arrival is chaotic in a bad sense, the movie doesn't take long enough to make the few points it has to make, and the Indian proprietor hops and jumps around for no particular reason. Smith and Dench and the rest are fine actors but the script doesn't give them any way to show this. I finally decided it was a total loss and dumped the CD into the trash. Great actors, bad script and terrible direction.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|If you don't buy this, you are probably saving your money for food, because that is the only reason not to buy this; you only have enough money to eat.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|If you are looking for a tell-all book on classified secrets, this is not the book for you.  The author says as much.  However, this book not only does a great job setting the record straight on the Bin Laden raid, but it gives you some real insight into what it is like to be a SEAL.  You feel almost like you are right there with them.<br /><br />This book is a MUST READ!
0316228532|4.0|I am a huge Harry Potter fan, so of course I will read anything put out by J.K. Rowling.  When I read the description of this book months ago, I was disappointed, as the plot didn't seem like one that would appeal to me.  However, I decided to give it a chance.  I generally finish every book I start, unless I am REALLY not enjoying a book.  For about the first half of this book, I was ready to quit.  The only thing that kept me reading was that I wanted to be able to assess the book fairly, since it is from a favorite author of mine.  There were two main things that made this book difficult for me to stick with. First, the characters are not very likeable at all.  They ranged from annoying to pathetic to downright repellent.  Second, I just couldn't get myself to care about the whole plot with the election and the Fields issue.<br /><br />Well, my 14-day library loan was coming to a close and I was only halfway through, so I tried to finish quickly (a bit of skimming here and there...) and finally, I started to enjoy the book... a little.  By the end, I did really want to know what was going to happen and I even began to like a few of the characters.  There may have even been a little bit of laughter and a few tears.  Overall, though, this book was kind of a downer.  Is there ONE single happy person in Pagford???  It was well-written for sure, and I'm sure there are many people who will enjoy it thoroughly.  It just wasn't my cup of tea.
B009CRLTVG|5.0|How can anyone remember his life in such detail? Rushdie must have kept notes daily. The book is better than any made-up fiction I have ever read. I read the book on Kindle, so I don't know whether there is a glossary of names. What a fascinating picture of the literary world it gives! Now maybe I should read something else that Mr.Rushdie has written!
0765348276|5.0|I got this book on the humble bundle ebook edition.<br />I loved the book, everything but the ending, it was very predictable but still very good and the first half of the book is excellent.<br />This is the first book from Scalzi that I read but I'll definitely buy another as soon as I finish the other books from the bundle
B009O8I34O|2.0|Experienced great difficulty with viewing the video.  When the video actually played (in five separate attempts)the full screen view was easy to see and decent for catching a missed episode.[[ASIN:B009O8I34O Phoenix]]
B0000VCZK2|4.0|The movies are timeless but beware of the crappy packaging on it! The disc trays dont stay in tact and there are gobs of glue coming out the corners and seams!
B007KQ6XYY|1.0|THis game is like so many others in this Angry Bird era. So many of these games have the same concept and I just repeatedly find myself bored.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|I dont care for free to play games but this one lets you quite a bit with out having to spend money
B0091REZMW|5.0|this is the same game I used on Facebook.  It starts out easy and gets harder. Even makes the room upside down and only with a flashlight.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|The game is addictive. I enjoy it. However, it does stink that the coins take so long to regenerate. But its one of the best free app I have downloaded.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|Played on my Samsung Galaxy S3, the graphics were great and the game play was really fun. The only problem I experienced was with the live online Multi-player. but this could have been due to my wi-fi connection. A game much worth getting!
B0051ANPZQ|4.0|A book sure to touch everyone's human side. Makes you want to be a better person.  A quick but enjoyable read.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|The writer really knows how to use words to create å great tale. Its erotic, but not too explicit. It has drama, suspense, mystery. It is everything one would want in å book. GREAT!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I really love this book, I also love the series. I not only love this series, but I love all of them that Rick has published about greek, egypion, etc mythology. I also not only love those books, but I love how rick makes good action books out of real myths. Over all, I love this book!
B002ECJZ76|3.0|I was so disappointed and frustrated while watching this film. I was looking forward to seeing a film with a European flair. I was ready for an off-beat, unconventional, un-Americanized story of Santa. I enjoy foreign films very much, and eagerly anticipated watching some fine Finnish acting and dialogue.<br /><br />There are two problems that I shall note:<br /><br />1. The dubbing. (It IS disclosed in the Amazon description that it is dubbed, but I did not see that. I thought nobody dubbed films anymore!) The dubbing undermines the characters, the story, the entire film. I watched the original Finnish behind-the-scenes stuff on the DVD and the original Finnish trailer and got the sense that it was so much better than it could ever be with the dubbing. There is no option for subtitles of any sort. It's the dubbing or nothing. Not only is the dubbing poorly done, but I'm sure there are elements of the story lost in translation.<br /><br />2. The story. To be fair, I have to take into consideration that much of the quality of the story, acting, etc. was lost due to the dubbing. I found the story meandering, uneven, and confusing. I didn't understand how the ending came about. The connections between the characters felt very odd a lot of the time. I don't really understand WHY Nikolas even sacrificed his life to making toys. The children even turn on him at one point, inexplicably. It was all rather bleak and muddling.<br /><br />I will say that the scenery is breathtaking, absolutely. The costume design was lovely. The attempt to filming an unusual story about Santa was a great idea, but I feel it failed. I cannot even recommend this for children. I'm not sure they would like it. I have no idea what I'm going to do with this DVD now.<br /><br />I would like to see this film with proper English subtitles and the original audio of Finnish.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Another great book in the Crossfire Series...a must read if you've read Bared to You.  Can't wait for the next book in the series to be released, I hope their story continues and we learn more about Cary's story.  Quick, entertaining read.  I'm a fan!
0679731725|5.0|This 1989 Booker Prize winner sees the impeccable head butler of the English country house Darlington Hall, Mr James Stevens, embarking upon a trip into the surrounding countryside and its villages after being persuaded to take some time off by his new employer, an American by the name of Mr Farraday. Being postwar fifties England, the house is viewed by Mr Farraday as more of a quaint relic than anything and Stevens also seems to be viewed somewhat in the same light, a \\"genuine English butler\\" from the grand old days of lords and gentlemen.<br /><br />As Stevens travels from village to village he recalls his own fond memories of service under Lord Darlington, memories which slowly paint a sad, all too obvious picture to the reader but to which Stevens himself seems oblivious, not due to any lack of intelligence on his part but rather because, being the very essence of English repression, he simply won't let himself. We begin to see that service to his employer Lord Darlington was Stevens' whole life, and that it was rendered unquestionably and with utmost loyalty. In his view, it was not the place of the servants to question, or even form an opinion of, their employers' decisions; their only task was to support them totally and provide the best possible service with the least possible intrusion.<br /><br />This aspect, however, takes somewhat of a back seat to a more personal realisation for Stevens. As he recalls events in the house we see him gradually drawing to Miss Kenton and she to him, only in his case as the stiff, proper butler he rationalises the small steps he allows himself to take as being in the interests of the house. Over the years, Stevens continues seemingly oblivious to her signals, although we see a small glimmer from time to time betraying the fact that he is slowly falling in love with her, but to her constant frustration he is just too English to admit it, even to himself, until the heartbreaking moment Miss Kenton announces she is going to marry and all Stevens can do is offer his congratulations.<br /><br />Thus it is that when Stevens receives her letter he reads a little too much between the lines, concluding that the former Miss Kenton wishes to return to work at the house. Convinced that this is the only reason he would like to see her again they arrange a meeting, and not long afterward the book comes to its inevitable yet tragic finale.<br /><br />The whole story is incredibly understated, set in the countryside of England with a typically calm, stiff-upper-lipped Englishman as its main character, yet whether it is the frustration at Stevens' stiffness or the sadness at his secret, silent heartbreak, an amazing amount of feeling comes out of the pages. It is almost heart-wrenching to see him finally question his years of service for the first time, leading him to the terrible realisation that perhaps he may have wasted his life. In turns amusing, serious, and almost profound, it is a gentle tale of lost love and missed chances, an ultimately moving account of one man's long overdue reflection on the way he has spent his life.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I have been playing this game for a while and I recommend this game. can not wait for the new ice age to come out!
B001KVZ6HK|4.0|This movie and quality for being a comic movie was nothing short of amazing. My one negative is not because of the movie but the delivery. I was excited all day at work anticipating it's arrival but did not show til 830 at night and I am usually in bed by oh well.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Clean, intuitive, feature-packed. Great tool for any truth-seeker. I use it across my devices and have been very satisfied with each version. Many thanks to the people who keep this app free!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|it is very fun and very addictive. to play. its a game every one is able to play. I love it
B008TMA1LY|5.0|this is such an amazing game. It's kinda ... hard at a point, but then it becomes quite addicting and then fun!  Hello Kitty lover's will like it ^.^ &lt;3
0525953728|5.0|this book was very good and the government went entirely overboard on it. This book was wrote as the perspective of a navy seal and what he went through on these mission's. Thank you so much for this book it gives a greater respect for what is being done to keep us americans safe.
0374214913|5.0|I thought this book was very refreshing and different.  I thoroughly enjoyed the setting and the story development.  I fail to see how anyone who loves books would not enjoy this story.  Moves along at a good pace, develops very well and the ending is appropriate.  It left me wanting to go pick up some really old books.
B005NPCUC8|5.0|This is the type of album where you have to listen to it as a whole to take in the full effect. ALso, ditch the crappy apple headphones and get a nice pair of headphones such as Audiotechnica or senheiser then listen to this album. There are subtle things that you can hear in this album if you have the bass on such as faint heartbeats in some songs. Dont even try to buy individual  songs from this album unless you are completing it because you are missing out on alot of stuff.
B0091REZMW|5.0|mystery manor is like a find the objects app. this app is very very very very very very very awesome and fun. get this app.
B006LSZECO|3.0|It jumped around a lot and was sort of hard to follow but my main dislike to the book was the constant foul language ...
B008XG1X18|5.0|I absolutely love Pintrest. Now that it has apps for my kindle fire and droid phone......Heaven. It is so easy to view.I love the vivid colors. Its like looking through a beautiful storybook.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|While I could only give Bared to You 4 stars, I can happily give this one 5 stars without hesitation. I loved this book and am dying to get my hands on the next one!<br /><br />Reflected in You starts off exactly where Bared to You ended. There is no time lapse. Fortunately, I was able to read these books back to back because I wasn't ready to say goodbye to this exciting couple after the first book ended.<br /><br />This book deals with more of the same: Gideon still struggles with opening up to Eva, the on again/off again madness is still prevalent, and the relationship still revolves mostly around sex. However, what made this book better then the first is that in this book, Eva and Gideon make real progress towards a healthier and more honest relationship. There were moments that I was convinced that these two people would never get things figured out enough to make things work, but then, just in the nick of time, Gideon starts to open up and reveals more of himself to Eva. In response, Eva begins to finally trust and believe in Gideon. It was pure magic to behold.<br /><br />I have no idea where Sylvia Day is going to take us in the next book. There is so much still left up in the air, but I have to trust that she will give Gideon and Eva the Happily Ever After that they both so desperately need (and deserve!)<br /><br />A big thank you to the Penguin Group via Netgalley for providing me with this copy for review!
B005H9B44A|4.0|The cool parts of the movie are in Asgard, but if you don't look to deeply into the movie, its fun to watch.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Love this book read it several times. Every time i find something new i have not read yet. Worth the money
B006LSZECO|3.0|Great beginning and middle...horrible ending. Really! A disappointing ending to a book a recommended as I was reading it. Should always finish a book first!!!
B002BU0DPE|5.0|Easy to hook up and they sound fantastic! Get them, you won't regret it! Plus you look like 80's Janet Jackson wearing them, or Bobby Brown...
0143122010|5.0|This is one of the 10 greatest books I have ever read (and re-read).  Pinker has assessed and addressed bias, and self righteousness and folk wisdom, propaganda, political fear-mongering, mythology and religious dogma; brought it out into the light, examined it from all sides and more thoroughly and intellectually challenged our typically simple way of thinking.  I am sure many readers tightened their white-knuckle grip on their biases and religious dogma as Pinker brilliantly asked us to consider what we have been told and what, for our own comfort wanted to believe. He continues to prove he is one of the great minds and writers of the 20th/21st century.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. It had everything I like: mystery that held my attention right to the end, old books, old libraries, moveable type letters, museums, Google programmers, cults, etc. - even a knit shop.
B007IXWKUK|2.0|this book is an improvement of the first, the depths of relationship opens up, so i would have gone for 4 starts, but i couldn't overlook the overly graphical scenes, repetition of words and phrases, profanity, and the ending. Really, feels like it's trying too hard, to summarize without spoiling, this is erotica-romance and now TaDa \\"mystery\\"
B009KKNLXE|5.0|What can I say?  I really like Castle.  The two stars were favorites from past shows.  Rick Castle used to be a space pirate of sorts in a series that was short but still good.  Kate Becket was a vampire in the second Librarian movie.  So, when I happened onto a show with both of them in it and the main stars; I immediately was captured.  Now, the only problem is that Castle is on Monday nights at 10:00 PM Eastern time....I usually end up missing the show due to work - not that I work nights, but getting up early is more difficult today, after staying up at night, then it used to be a few years back.  So the fact that I can buy the show from Amazon Prime is perfect.  Even when I catch the show - which is still most of the time, like I said, I like the series - some times I just need to see it again, and again.
B00910Y1OQ|3.0|Pretty fun but crashes at random times. The art is nice but the story is chinsy unless youre really into the roman god stories or whatever. (Ginger: submitted by my teenager)
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Excellent! Takes a modern view of many aspects of WW2. Humanizes, personal experiences of the war in a way, I have not read before in vast novels on the topic. Raises the whole issue of 'nuclear war' from its birth,.. all from perspectives that seem more conceivable today, now that we have reached a post soviet generation. I can not wait for part 3!
B008XCJ03K|5.0|We found about Passenger from a recent concert at the house of blues where he preformed as an opener. We liked the songs he did so much that we picked up this CD. Needles to say the music is awesome and we purchased his other CD's as well.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|love this app it lets me know how much battery life has charged and how much more needs to go
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Highly additive, a must have app. I spent over 2hours playing the first night. I recommend getting this app today.
B00910Y1OQ|3.0|Despite insufficient instructions, I really enjoyed playing this game. it was beautiful to look at, challenging enough to hold my interest, but not so hard that I got too frustrated.  BUT ... a little more than halfway through the game it quit loading. I powered down and rebooted. I removed and reinstalled. Nothing worked, and now its unplayable.  Galaxy Note.
0131988425|5.0|Currently taking the class with Dr. Oppenheim at MIT and I have to say this is one of the best texts I have encountered, not just in the DSP field, but in electrical engineering in general. Well written, comprehensive, and extremely practical. This textbook is geared not just towards the mathematical theory, but towards design techniques and it is rich with examples. The chapters are a pleasure to read (compared to most other EE textbooks) and assesses all design aspects from the high level specifications to the actual procedure step by step. This book will remain on my bookshelf as my main DSP reference for years to come.<br /><br />And as usual, Amazon delivers promptly and in perfect condition.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|I did not get a chance to watch all of Season 7 of the Supernatural series.  Purchasing the show in its entirety was a perfect way to watch this season at my own speed and commercial-free!  Can't wait for season 8!!
B008FPOIT6|3.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading Penumbra! Clever story line, well developed characters and plot. I have not investigated the historical accuracy of Gerritszoon yet but, if correct, it adds a lot to the story. It was fun.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Sure, there were some kindle glitches, but i loved it but i thought the series was only 3 books, but  really good
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|i got this game as one of the free app a day and i love it its very fun and you dont have to have wifi to use it. call of Atlantis is a great game. buy it you will like it
B009A3NGF4|5.0|As good as their first album with even more diversity and passion.  I would highly encourage any one who enjoyed their earlier work to give babel a shot
B0055SWM08|4.0|Cute puzzle game that makes you think. Some puzzles are really challenging and I like how this game doesn't make me feel anxious to solve the puzzles quickly.
B000002P74|5.0|If you're a fan of Lynyrd Skynyrd, then I don't need to tell you that all of their albums (before the demise of Ronnie Van Zant) are classic and great... every song is a winner. But, I'm reviewing this album for its extra track \\"Was I Right Or Wrong?\\"  It's a demo of a rare Skynyrd track... you might find another version on a compilation. As with any Skynyrd song, it's a great song. Their popular songs that get airplay are well known. But, if you like Skynyrd, check out their lesser known tracks, like \\"Was I Right Or Wrong?\\" or \\"I Need You\\" (another track on this album... one of my favorites.) Basically, you can't go wrong with any Skynyrd album choice, but if you don't already have one, Second Helping is a good place to start. I also recommend Pronounced... (first album) and Nuthin' Fancy.
B000BI0WOA|5.0|Just as I expected...great!!  One of the best audio productions I have in my collection.  I listen to the set on the highway at high volume and it gets me to my destination fast.  No problem listening to it over again.  Great buy.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|it was amazing with unexpected turns. i am certain that the movie wont be as good because movies never do books much justice, but we will see. :)
B00931JMRE|5.0|This sends you right back to the first two ZZ Top albums! Great guitar riffs, Texas boogie to the Max.! Reminds me of what brought me to these guys in the first place! Welcome back Billy, Dusty and Frank! Awesome CD! Oh, Baby! (Do it again!)
B008Y5OW20|5.0|Unlike Rod Stewart's never ending great American Songbook drivel and even Sir Paul's horrible retro jazz standard disaster...Jeff Lynne challenges the late great Harry Nilsson who's [[ASIN:B0045DO89M Little Touch of Schmilsson in the Night]]  was so far ahead of its time in concept and execution that it still stands head and shoulders above the rest.<br /><br />For me the beauty of this project besides the obvious very eclectic song choice is the fact that Mr Lynne chose to treat these tunes as though they were ELO songs in his production and performance and so they become fresh to my ears and an absolute delight. The problem with Macca is that he chose to use seasoned Jazz and Pop support and really just ad his voice to well worn sounding arrangements and frankly his voice pales in comparison to the Jazz and Pop greats that came before him. Mr Lynne treats these standards with love and his normal ELO flair and they just bring joy and smiles. I can't pick a favorite they are all splendid in their own way and if I may say so he does the impossible for me on \\"Love Is A Many Splendid Thing\\" which is to make a song I've never liked...quite a fun romp. With nods to Richard Rogers, The Everly Brothers, Roy Orbison , Chuck Berry, Bobby Darin and even Charlie Chaplin...this is going to be an evergreen in my substantial collection..<br /><br />HIGHLY recommended.
0385528752|4.0|I was introduced to this book via an HBR link. Its such an effective book of complex material simply put to the reader, surely can transform people's lives if \\"understood\\" correctly. If you are recommending to someone else, its better to prepare them for it.<br /><br />Brilliant book. Have become a fan of the authors.
B004X80QNG|2.0|I used PI on my old windows phone and it worked great. Not so much on Android...missing some big pieces of the puzzle like Google Task syncing and syncing back and forth from calendars. Other programs are able to do a full sync back and forth so there is really no excuse.
B000E6EHGI|5.0|this release gives ammo to those who think studio dead is as good as live dead.! although, i am not in that camp, i love this music!! this is as close to jazz as the dead ever got... i've had this on vinyl since it came out but treated myself to the expanded version after listening to the rehearsal jams from this cd recorded at bobby's studio in 1975,,, on archives...this release and the jams  are spectacular ! the extent and complexity of the improvisational music being played is amazing !!..just a reminder of how great an album this is ! do yourself a favor, listen to it again,,enjoy the new stuff and smile !!!!!
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|A fun time killer.  I enjoy it for the Zen of it.  Relaxing,  entertaining, colorful and simple enough for the kids.
1401322786|5.0|This is another amazing book by Mitch Albom.  It was hard to put it down.  Very interesting and informative.  Never knew how time was calculted before.
B001GXF2YY|5.0|Det. Bosch really has a mess on his hands this time. From the race card to  a lawyer that was a victim. Also thrown in is a good family problem, his wife is on a roll .....
B007TXN4TK|4.0|It is wonderful. Has helped me greatly. I would give this program a four star. Having a great time learning the piano it is beautiful music.
B0008ISM40|5.0|With Teeth. Trent Reznor and Nine Inch Nails prove themselves yet again with this excellent installment of industrial rock, whatever you call it. I dig most of the tracks - The Hand That Feeds, Every Day is Exactly the Same, With Teeth, Sunspots - and the rest are also great! To be honest, I've yet to be disappointed by this group. Lots of emotion and power delivered acoustically in a way that sticks in your head. Keep it coming Nine Inch Nails!<br /><br />Did I mention that this was one of the CD's that kept me going in Iraq for over a year? Yeah, really good stuff!
B0087HT36U|5.0|good game. A lot of fun. It was addictive and had a lot of maps. I can't. wait for the pirates one to be done.
B00992CF6W|5.0|i love minecraft but i dont wanna pay $7 bucks for it. i want them to come out with the free version
B0096DFBZQ|3.0|I don't really understand this game, however my sons and their friends are having a great time with it. I will figure it out soon.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I love the direction this trilogy is taking. the love and lust is definitely always sizzling! But now there is more.<br />I was very pleased
B008FQ1O1K|4.0|this story does a great job taking you on a journey.  its not just the end point or climax, its reflective and progressive
B008TMOIEK|2.0|I purchased this album to share with a friend. She loved it but I found the music selections to be rather tame. I was expecting more passion.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|A Satisfying, if not fairy tale, ending for this rather intriguing trilogy...brings closure for many characters, including new ones introduced in this book..Katniss continues to be the reluctant heroine of this series which portrays the best and worst of humanity in a very readable tale...she may be destined to become one of the more memorable women in popular literature...strong but socially awkward...beautiful without really knowing or flaunting it...and rather unaware of how her very presence affects the lives of so many others..<br /><br />Be warned...this book does not glorify war nor should it...there is great loss and a bittersweet ending...but the characters stay true to who they are destined to be, often with great consequence...<br /><br />The story is also a great example of being careful of what you wish for...sometimes the cure can be as bad as the illness...loved the way Katniss showed true awareness and selflessness in such an unexpected way when she boldly acted to ''cure the cure''...<br /><br />In short, if you liked the previous books in this series you will just have to buy it to find out what happens to the characters you have come to love or despise...thankfully, you will have a good time doing just that...
B006AZZPCM|5.0|One of those apps you're not sure why you need but you do and it does make watching YouTubes easier and seems to work without any problems.  I would recommend, not because I can tell you why but because it works.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Love the story..can't wait until the last book comes out in December...This was written a lot better than the Fifty Shades of Grey series.  Couldn't put the book down and at times could not wait to see what happened next so skimmed forward to find out then resumed at the place I originally left off.
B009CPRYG2|5.0|Wow!  This has the same great look and feel of the comic.  Great to see it come to life.  Not just a well done on the art side, but the mood set by the music and voice acting is spot on.
B007SGM084|4.0|The fifty trilogy are really good books. An dont regrer reading them at all! Every guy should read rhem to get some more knowledge and expertise, that also goes for the girls
B008M87GJK|5.0|Very pleased visually as well as content with the BBC news.  I enjoy getting away from US news sources and this is a great choice.  At times a bit fluffy in content but if you need to know it is a good app.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Had to get a replacement kindle and the game can not be transferred with out losing my progress :( I was pretty far into the game and lost it all. so now I am playing again. But I do like the game, pretty fun and addicting!
B008G8SFGO|5.0|It is hard to believe that the ROCK group KISS are still making music after all these years. I remember me and my buddy would put KISS ALIVE 1 on the then Record Player,set the speed at 33 and would have a air guitar rock festival in our rooms until we dropped. We didn't stop there then came KISS ALIVE 2 were we became professionals with our air guitar abilities, and with each KISS album we continued to rock hard.<br /> Now to the new KISS album MONSTER, all I can say Is WOW!!! The band is still rocking hard, and now that I am much older, and bald,and my joints ache, I dusted off my Air Guitar and started rocking again.It was hilarious, and I think I scared my dog. Well after the music stopped to this album, I was burnt out and had to take a nap.<br /> Well after a good two day rest I put it on again in my car. Yeah I was driving down the road just a singing and a rocking to the music and boy did I make a spectacle of myself especially when I stopped at the red lights and stop signs.(A old bald man rocking to KISS, you get the picture). After I gained my composer as we old people have to do, I drove home got in the house and took another nap.<br /> Okay enough, KISS is still great and I suggest to you that you go out and buy the new KISS MONSTER album.<br />P.S. While you are buying KISS MONSTER go ahead and get KISS DESTROYER Resurrected album as well, they both are crystal clear sounding and are priced well for old KISS fans like me.<br />ROCK AND ROLL ON! AND FROM TIME TO TIME DUST OFF THE AIR GUITAR AND HAVE FUN.
B008RV5K5E|5.0|While I have read the original Dark Knight Returns comic book more out of curiosity than in earnest, this adaptation really brings the story to life, even though it's now broken into two parts, which makes some sense if you're trying to avoid compressing a good story like that into 90 minutes or 2 hours. (Imagine Crisis On Infinite Earths being done like this...that would take up 4 to 6 parts in an adequate adaptation!)<br /><br />Anyway, I like the choice of Peter Weller, best known for the main character of \\"RoboCop\\", voicing Batman, which seems rather suitable for the grim and gritty world he has to face after his retirement and watching the world (and Gotham City) go to hell all around him. Batman just can't stop being Batman, and in times that are more brutal he has to be prepared and change with the times, not to mention handle the fact that he isn't the spry young man he once was. I like Carrie Kelley being Robin, which gives the Batman and Robin relationship more of a father and daughter relationship, given that her own parents are more interested in getting high than raising a child. The whole first part is basically Batman dealing with the leader of the Mutants and Harvey Dent released from Arkham with a whole new face, yet is unable to escape the monster he has become from years of being Two-Face.<br /><br />The animation and artwork is excellent, as a sort of mix between the original comic book style and Superman/Batman: Public Enemies. I can't wait for Part 2 to come out, which will tell the other end of the story.
B004LUS390|3.0|I was hoping that there would be more instructions.  This is a paid product, because of that unless it is something you know how to use I would not recomment it.  I will work on it more when I have free time but at this point it is a no for me.
0143121421|5.0|If you read spy fiction your really should read at least of few of le Carre's books.  There's a quiet brooding style he has that really puts him in the literature class, as opposed to the Bond stuff.  Also, le Carre really knows his stuff.  Excellent novel.
034580404X|5.0|The Fifty shades of grey trilogy was great.  The description was perfect. There was the right amount of love story and love making in the book and it is written very classy not smutty. I recommend every person above 18 male or female should read these books.
B009CPJHY4|4.0|The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel provides an entertaining look at modern India culture mixed with the trials and tribulations facing folks in retirement.  Interesting character studies and back ground make for an enjoyable break from routine. Content is suitable for mature audiences.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it'd really good for passing time.....excpesially if you don't want to do the same thing over and over again. Aldo a good thing to do in heavy traffic.....haha
B000RZIGVS|1.0|I just ordered this dvd set for my husband who has wanted it for a very long time.  We noticed that is did not come with the poster it says it comes with.  I also read the warning review that says if you don't get the poster you probably got a bootleg.  I'm a little pissed that I spent this kind of money on a bootleg!!
B004NWAYYS|5.0|As always Amazon delivered the book on time and in excellent condition.  This book by Dan Brown is great.  I cannot believe the amount of research involved in some of these books; especially this one.  You'll be on the edge of your seat through some of this book and totally involved in others.  Timely and up-to-date, you'll think you should be hearing something on the actual news about this.  Loved it!
B005LAII9Y|5.0|This movie is wonderfully eccentric, like most Tim Burton movies, but it also is a wonderful heartfelt story about a lovable dog and his precocious and devoted boy. I have the original \\"Frankenweenie,\\" (which I found on Amazon, thank you for that!) and while it was a good story, there really wasn't  the time to  flesh out the characters and connect with them. In this version, you make that  connection  . Sparky is adorable, funny and absolutely charming. Anyone who has ever loved a dog will understand Victor's heartbreak when he loses his best friend and his delight when he gets him back! I got totally immersed in the movie. I am a big Tim Burton fan, granted, but I don't see how anyone wouldn't enjoy this movie. I'll be the first in line when this item is available!
B002UBRFDC|5.0|This is just another one of Clavell's outstanding works.  Wonderful story, magnificent detail.  Highly recommended. Feels like you are living the story. Clavell's grasp of the time and culture is amazing.
B0018QOIXU|5.0|I love this CD. I just got it in late 2012, but it's nice to hear her great songs without commericals on the radio. Great songs on this track. I play it at work and passengers love it while I drive.
0385504209|5.0|I read this book in paperback many years ago and loved it.  I have the other books in this series in hard back so I had to order this one to go with them.  It was delivered in excellent condition and on time.  Dan Brown is one of those writers you just WANT and NEED to read.  Great!
B007ZTN07O|5.0|fun, simple controls, cool attacks. could use a bigger character selection. awesome game overall.best fighting game on the kindle fire
B00457WZEI|3.0|This book is a good children's read.  Reminded me a lot of Black Beauty. Too predictable for a good novel.
B007TK77QE|3.0|I was wanting to read this to see if I would love JK's adult fiction as much as her children's  fiction, unfortunately I didn't.
B005RAO0GS|5.0|This is one of the most amazing albums I have heard in a very long time.<br />I dont' think I need to say anything more!
B007I2BZIE|4.0|First off, let me just say that a 4 star Rush album is the same as a 5 star anybody else.  If you are a fan you know what I mean.  I would have given it 4.5 stars but no way to do that.<br /><br />People love to give long-winded, flowery reviews so they can sound like they work for Spin or Rolling Stone.  Don't want to do that.  Just wanna get to the point.<br /><br />I've followed Rush through all of their changes.  I've never heard a \\"bad\\" Rush album but I still don't get Vapour Trails.  It's the only one since 1978 that I don't own.<br /><br />Anyway, I heard Caravan and BU2B when they toured a couple of years ago, they had already written them and released them.  They grew on me.  I really like Caravan.  BU2B is really good as well.  Don't agree with the \\"anti-religion\\" bent but it's a good song and I get it.<br /><br />Anyway, IMO, Caravan, BU2B, Seven Cities of Gold, and Headlong Flight are the best songs on the album.  I REALLY like Headlong Flight, it's a rocker (as are the other (3) I mentioned). The bass is fast and furious, especially on Headlong Flight and Seven Cites of Gold. Saw them do most of the album in concert a few weeks ago and Headlong Flight was the highlight of the new stuff.<br /><br />The album, to me, sounds like a cross between Snakes and Arrows and Counterparts.  It has a deep, driven sound (most of it) and the riffs really remind me of Stick it Out.  I think Counterparts is way under-rated, BTW.  Regardless, I really like the sound of Clockwork Angels.  The Wreckers is nice, a little slow, but good harmonies.  I know The Garden is a favorite of some.  There are kind of two Rush camps: those who like the hard stuff and those who like all of it.  Personally, I love some of the easier stuff like Bravado, Time Stand Still, etc.  That being said, I really like the first four songs I mentioned a lot better.  The slower stuff is good but it just doesn't grab me. The only thing<br />\\"bad\\" I can say about the album is that some of the songs sound pretty similar.  I guess after 15 or so albums it's  hard to make all of them that different.<br /><br />Clockwork Angels is a rocker, IMO.  If you liked Counterparts and/or Snakes and Arrows I think you'll like it.  4.5 stars.
0981951252|5.0|The Compound Effect audio book is an enjoyable book filled with practical information and great stories that support the points made.  It cannot be over emphasized enough that the key to anything is to take 100% personal responsibility for your choices and this point is made emphatically.  In addition, keeping a \\"score card\\" of exactly WHAT you are doing in an area of your life that you want to change is remarkably effective.  I would love to give this audio book to everyone I know!
0345803485|1.0|this book is terrible....i could not even get through the first chapter...its soo boring and its about college girls<br />Why would all the bored housewives be so interested in this ???? sad to say that litrature has come to this
B003WJQ74E|5.0|The view point expressed in this book are quite interesting.  Not only an interesting story but one that gets you to think.
B005WUHAX8|3.0|The LifeProof Case is great in theory, but not in reality. It's extremely hard to hear the other person when on a phone call. They sound very muffled in the ear piece. You must open the bottom flap when talking otherwise you can not be heard. The touch screen cover must be pressed quite hard in order to register your touch. The plastic the case is made from feels cheap and cracked slightly near the top after 2 weeks of using it. I did really like the waterproof aspect of the case, though. All in all I was not impressed.
B0086700CM|5.0|This is a great game especially if your into fast games that give you a rush. Its a nice game if your bored and wanna pass some time. I love trying to pass the challenges. And I can wait to finish the achievements!! I think the performence is great no problems IT DOESNT LAG and I would recommend it to all of my friends!
B008673ZAQ|4.0|No inner goddess, no biting her lip, at least Eva has her own job, her own money, and her own issues. Her and Gideon are closer to equals which makes their interactions more interesting. While the second book in the series leaves a lot of loose ends, I would pick this over the Shades of Grey series any day.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This app is very handy!  I use it daily for multiple alarms as I work an odd schedule.  The options for alarm sounds are excellent.
B005974C94|5.0|A big fan of collaborations and putting Clapton with Marsalis was genius. Especially fond of this version of Layla, the durge seems to enhance it. Would have liked to of been a fly on the wall with their conversations about music.
B0087HT36U|5.0|I really enjoy this game!  The designers put forth great effort in creating a challenge with outstanding graphics.  I have seen other reviews comparing this to Angry Birds but I find Siege Hero to be more precise in its targeting.  In order to complete a task, you must use the assigned tools to destroy the enemy's fort while trying to spare the villagers. I have completed all the levels and await the ones to come.  This is an addictive game.  I encountered no problems using my Kindle Fire.
B008VIKLWA|5.0|To ALL THOSE IGNORANT PEOPLE WHO MISTREAT OR KILL ANIMALS FOR PLEASURE!  THIS MOVIE SHOWS THAT ANIMALS HAVE MORÉ SENSE THAN ADULTS!  AND HAVE MORÉ VALÚES THAN HUMANS !  VERY EDUCATIONAL AND A DOCUMENTARY EVERY CHILD SHOULD SEE!
0061148512|5.0|I've never felt compelled to review a book.  Though, after reading some of the negative reviews here, which admittedly, are few and far between, I almost feel obliged to share my two cents.<br /><br />Okay, so to those of you who've complained about the book not having a plot, let me put a question forward: Does your own life have a plot?<br /><br />Although - as far as I understand it at least - this book is not totally autobiographical, it is closely twined with Sylvia Plath's actual life.  This being so, the story isn't going to run along a straight line so that the reader can peripatetically meander down humdrum lane; it's not going to pave a path while mapping every corner or hold your hand while you turn each page.  It runs true to how life is, and it does so beautifully.  Beyond beautifully.  It does so with sincerity, complete candour and devastating insight.  This, for me, trumps any book bearing a contrived plotline, regardless even of how magnificent that plot may be.<br /><br />Second, Syliva Plath was severely depressed.  If you felt that Esther's character lacked depth because her actions / thought processes made no sense; then frankly, you're a poop head.  The whole issue with depression is that it makes no sense.  Its effects are not grounded in logic and thus make it impossible to provide `reasons' or justifications for why Esther felt and lived and acted in the way she did.  I can't help but feel that your issue is not with the book itself, but rather, with depression.  Maybe, if you did some research into the bleak facts that bed the ground depression flowers from, you'd have enjoyed reading this masterpiece much more.  It will indeed allow you to appreciate the complexity of layers that Esther's character possesses.  And if it doesn't, well, that's your problem.<br /><br />Finally, aside from The Bell Jar providing for a small slice of English genius; aside from The Bell Jar totally absorbing its reader into the malevolent, chimerical void that it conjures; aside from the fact that it doesn't necessarily have a strictly defined plotline, the Bell Jar posits as a beguiling venture into the spirit of a severely depressed human being.  And further to this, it allows its reader to swim in pools filled with the proverbial tears that are shed from all people who experience this crippling, juggernaut of a psychosis.  I mean, isn't this what classics are made of?  Raw engagement?<br /><br />This really is one of the best books I've ever read; right up there with 1984 (my ultimate favourite).  I can't recommend it highly enough.  Just read the damned thing.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|love. playing. It's a great way to kill some time. It also has great replay value.  Can't wait for more playrix games.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I played this on my Kindle Fire and had no problems.  Loved it!  Great story line, excellent graphics and challenging tasks make this a terrific gaming experience!  It is played similarly to Jewels but there are obstacles that present a mind challenge to overcome.  No aggravating pop-up ads to ruin the game.  Hope they create more levels in the future.  Thanks!
B002WCLG48|3.0|The disk case that I received had a large scratch that went deep into the plastic on the front of it. Luckily, the disks themselves were in perfect condition.<br /><br />The quality of the Halo Legends dvd is a different matter. If you're a large fan of the lore, then a lot of the things you'll see in this don't make too much sense. Spartans don't act like Spartans, feelings are drawn out to unfathomable extremes.<br /><br />The introduction into the universe that Halo Legends offers (Origins I, II) were actually pretty great. For fanatics and casuals alike, it was a neat, somewhat basic explanation of the lore. There was stuff that was left out, but I think it was supposed to be simplistic. Something to give you a good picture of the Forerunners, and talked a lot about human traits.<br /><br />There was a story of a Sangheili (Elite) that questioned the religion of the Prophets. It showed a small length of what happened when you went against strict authority in the Covenant, even if it was something as small as not believing a religion. The characters were slightly strange though, the protagonist's wife giggled like a school girl, and had a strange look about her. It's been described as \\"artistic interpretation\\", but it's still weird. The end was drawn out too much, only for an unsatisfying conclusion. It was a good, four-stars though. There were a lot of good things in it that I'll let you experience for yourself if you decide to purchase this item.<br /><br />There was another story of a Spartan who wanted to run away after receiving her augmentations, and being trained for seven years or so. People who've invested themselves in the lore will not be happy with this story. There is a small group of Spartans (before they saw any service in their armor) who wanted to run away and get back to their old lives. Knowing that Spartans had been indoctrinated for war from a young age, this seemed highly unlikely. The protagonist was not afraid to show her over-exaggeratedfeelings at every turn. It definitely went against the strong, stoic super soldiers that Spartans are generally shown as. Two stars might be pushing it.<br /><br />There were a few others that had the same issues, but one short was especially atrocious. It was a non-canonical story of Spartan 1337. It was a bad attempt at humor for the lore. The character is goofy (Although his voice actor wasn't too bad), there were dinosaurs, and a large ape-thing that was involved. It was pretty terrible.<br /><br />The Babysitter, as it is called, is one of my favorites. It follows a group of ODSTs in their next mission to assassinate a Prophet. There was a Spartan involved, and it showed the tension between Spartans and ODSTs fairly well. The different height dimensions for some of the ODSTs were a little odd, but it can be overlooked. The end was a little cliche, but it was still one of the better stories this dvd had to offer.<br /><br />The Package used CGI instead of anime styled drawings. It was neat a few years ago, but if you've ever watched Red vs. Blue, you might not be too amazed with the animations now. One Spartan's jaw was absolutely ridiculous. So ridiculous that I had to put it in this review. Some of the more well known Spartans like Fred and Kelly had a part in this. Although I feel like they weren't pictured spot on, it wasn't terrible either. There were a lot of terrible lines purposely implemented into this short that really bothered me. It was way to cheesy for my liking.<br /><br />On a side note, there was an unfinished battle between the Master Chief and an Elite Major here. From doing a lot of research, that same elite seems to manufacture weapons now. It's been speculated that he will return in the Reclaimer trilogy. I'd love to finish the fight between Chief and that Elite in one of the future games, no pun intended.<br /><br />Overall, it's something to think about if you've got an extra 20$ laying around. I don't regret buying it, but I could've gone on without it, too.
0316228532|5.0|i don't think i've ever written a review, but the reviews for this book are so bad and i loved it so much that i had to write.  here are some thoughts that might help you decide to buy this book or not:<br /><br />whether or not you liked harry potter will have nothing to do with your liking/hating this book.<br /><br />not much happens in this book.  it's very \\"slice of life.\\"  it's a character study of about a billion (ok actually about 12 but it's very easy to get confused as to who is who)characters.<br /><br />i think most people will find the book too boring during the first 1/3 and bail.  i felt this way during the first 1/8 or so and was also lost with all the characters. by the first 1/4 though, i was starting to \\"get it\\" and to \\"get into it\\" and then was hooked.<br /><br />the bit of action in this book seems trite and boring at first.  that is the point.  that doesn't change much until the last 1/4 and it's still no roller coaster ride.<br /><br />if you like anything horton foote has ever written, you'll probably like this book (\\"trip to bountiful\\").<br /><br />there's just no denying that jk rowling is incredibly gifted--the most gifted living author in my opinion.  reading this book will cause you to marvel at her abilities with the written word.<br /><br />i can honestly see college students studying this book in literature classes in 25 years and still in 100 years.<br /><br />this book isn't for everyone. that's forsure.  i wish i could nail down who it was for to help you out if you are on the fence.  at the very least, get on the wait list at your local library.  when you get it, stick it out.  finish it.  it could be the best book you've read in years.  it was for me.<br /><br />thank you to jk rowling for gifting us so much thought provoking reading with harry potter and now with the tiny town of pagford.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|This app works reasonably well, but sticking my head out the door works better. The price is right so that is why I gave it an \\"average\\" rating.
B00355L2TU|4.0|Perfect for anyone with limited time.  Intense enough to build up a sweat and with a demonstration of an \\"easier\\" version of all the moves.  I love it!
B008XBCJ34|4.0|I saw this in IMAX 3D when it came out original, so I wanted to wait for the basic 3D release on Blu-ray over buying the 2D version despite it being extended etc. This movie is one of the best 3D movies thus far, so I'd give it a perfect 3D rating, but I've had the basic DVD version since it's been available on iTunes, so I've watched it to death by now. It's a great story, but way too linear and when I originally watched it I knew what the ending would be about half way through at the theater. The production sets a new standard for motion capture techniques, but I found they used too much BLUE in the color pallet for Pandora. When I'm in the mood this will be a good time, but like I mentioned I've watched it so many time via the iTunes version It no longer excites me at all, even watching it in 3D now doesn't make much difference.<br /><br />Like many have stated, unless you really want to see the original release version I'd wait for the extended edition with extras etc. This is just a bare bones original theatrical release with no extras whatsoever. Personally this is enough for me, I'm way over the greed of these director... they are milking these franchise releases to death and they apparently have no shame in doing so, Jackson/LOTR and now this... Harry Potter, etc on and on. Greed.
B00913DPW2|5.0|Great game!!  If you are a fan of escape and mystery type games you will love this game. A bit difficult but very deep game play. It will take some time to figure this one out. You will not be dissapointed.
B006UG909U|4.0|Of course it would have been better with Micheal Anthony (i don't care for the production, where they \\"double up\\" Dave's vocals for harmony) and sure 5 of the songs are old, but they are still good. Frankly, the band hasn't rocked like this in years. Aside from the somewhat dopey title, a solid outing from VH
0812984412|5.0|Cloud Atlas<br />David Mitchell<br />Random House Trade Paperbacks<br />First Edition - August 17, 2004<br />ISBN-13: 978-0375507250<br />528 pages<br /><br />In many of my past book reviews I've discussed the concept of the writer's voice when describing style, inventiveness, and thought-provoking, imaginative, and inspired literature. In the case of David Mitchell his voice resonates with unquestionable clarity and Cloud Atlas, which to me reads more like poetry than prose, is an outstanding opus for any genre. Indeed, by its nature, it cannot be simply pigeon-holed into any one genre but skirts the neighborhood of many. Masterful story-telling combined with creative plots and twists and turns make Cloud Atlas my favorite book of the year and is, in my opinion, a near-perfect work of fiction and an instant classic. Mr. Mitchell has crafted an interesting and entertaining tale filled with curious themes and remarkable elements that effortlessly tie together in some fashion or another, usually via a common thread (i.e. Movies, books, music, or people.)Themes of reincarnation, attempted murder, pirates and sailing on the high seas, the human drama, Science Fiction, suicide, dystopian society, poetry, succinct language (no one does two and three word sentences better), Fantasy, corporate cover-up, sex, altruism, and survival are all expertly and brilliantly represented in this multi-player and multi-thematic story.<br /><br />Cloud Atlas is divided into six interrelated story-lines narrated by as many diverse characters and ascends up through history from the mid-19th century into a distant post-apocalyptic future world. The stories are all interlinked expertly using either certain reoccurring (reincarnated?) individuals and/or their associates or by the letters, music, or lives that they've touched. Everything is connected and spiked with head-spinning D&eacute;j&agrave; vu.<br /><br />In the first vignette, written in the form of diary entries, we learn of Adam Ewing, a writer out to make a name for himself and his fateful trip from New Zealand to O-Hawaii in 1849. (Note: For some this may be the most difficult chapter in the book to read (the style is period) but stick with it - the rewards are entirely worth the work.) The book concludes with the sad story of Mr. Ewing and the hardship he suffers at the hands of a devious scam artist.<br /><br />The second chapter introduces con-man Robert Frobisher who has been forced to vacate Europe due to a long history of philandering, gambling, cuckolding, and debt (in some cases all four simultaneously.) Frobisher decides to ingratiate himself into the lives of an aging but brilliant music composer and his wife and daughter in an attempt to gain employment and advance. His story is revealed in a number of letters to his friend and sometimes bi-sexual lover Rufus Sixsmith. (Aside: The number six, which is the number of harmony and balance, also recurs many times throughout the story.)<br /><br />The third novella centers on Luisa Rey, a reporter, who has stumbled onto a huge corporate cover-up that could push the world over the edge of self-destruction. What she learns from scientist Rufus Sixsmith (the same considerably older character mentioned earlier) could change the course of history - if she can survive long enough to tell the story.<br /><br />The fourth short story is extremely entertaining and could have been written for the Twilight Zone or Outer Limits. Timothy Cavendish, a book publisher, has recently achieved sudden and immense wealth by publishing the memoirs of a man that committed an unexpected murder. When the man is sentenced to prison Cavendish reaps the benefits of the popularity of the book but must contend with the murderer's unsavory family. Mr. Cavendish's unhappy fate is poignant, disturbing, and in some ways predictable.<br /><br />In the fifth section Somni -451, a fabricant (or clone), has been pulled from her service job waiting tables and serving  food atPapa Song's to be used (and abused) as an experiment by a wealthy college post-grad. Unfortunately, her freedom comes at a very high price.<br /><br />The sixth chapter, the centerpiece of the book, is my favorite. Written in the colloquialism of the post-apocalyptic Hawaiian (Ha-Way) Islands the language takes some getting used to (I found it easier to read it quickly.) But the story itself is very compelling and filled with unique and creative dystopian tropes that will leave even the most jaded readers in awe of Mitchell's skill. Technology, for the most part, is gone and the denizens of Hawaii have been living subsistence existences for years, But, when a ship arrives with people who use \\"old-un\\" technology things are about to change. And not at all how anyone expects them to...<br /><br />Cloud Atlas does not end there, however. Each chapter, and subsequent story, folds back onto itself in opposite order to be neatly and comprehensively pieced back together and the preceding loose ends tied up into a climactic ending that is altogether brilliant, inventive, and concise. This is literature at its best combining fragments of Science Fiction, Fantasy, drama, mystery, post-apocalyptic dystopia, and the human condition together into a highly entertaining and spell-binding read. Cloud Atlas is a magnificently crafted and indelible work of fiction. Thank you Mr. Mitchell, it is definitely one of my top ten island reads.<br /><br />I have never read any of Mr. Mitchell's work before but I certainly will now... look out Amazon.com here I come, credit card in hand!<br /><br />Recommended for, well, everyone...<br /><br />6 out of 5 stars<br /><br />The Alternative<br />Southeast Wisconsinto be used (and abused) as an experiment by a wealthy college post-grad.

B002UBRFDC|5.0|This may be fiction but, it gives us an insight into the Japanese way of life.  Goes well with the TV series.
0525953728|5.0|A must read. Very good couldn't put it down. Lots of detail. It is a must read if you are into military reads.
B0083TXXZ4|5.0|Everyone knows what you get when you purchase a Nerf toy so I won't go into a great deal of detail here. However, what I can say is that every time this toy comes out everyone in the house has fun. Recommended for children ages 8 to 108. Fun, Fun, FUN!!!!
B003ODIZL6|5.0|Why do i have to do this with every book i read.<br />This isn't a really book. why do they think that this is a book. its not a book it is  a dictionary.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I give this one 4 stars but only because of the time jumps...It all just moves TOO fast. But then again, Ana and Christian's entire relationship has moved fast! But I wanted MORE from this third book and I do hope there will be a fourth now.  Yes. it's a lot of smut (as some say) but I loved it.  It's romantic smut for women. lol
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Rick Riordan continues to put out novels that catch and keep people in. It's great to see how as his audience has aged he is showing the development of characters as people actually change and is including more mature content, although not too mature. As usual, Riordan seems to be incapable of finishing with anything but a perfect cliffhanger, certain to keep anyone who reads The Mark of Athena coming back.
B007THA4FI|1.0|The story began as a page turner. I looked forward to what would happen to the characters and the coming events. I did not realize that was the prolouge. Trying to get through Chapter one is wrenching. I eventually gave up and started reading from one of my other favorite authors. One day I will go back to try and finish the book, especially since paying the price for the new release. I recommend borrowing from the library when it's available.
B008CLI3TE|5.0|My wife and I have heard so many good things about this series, sowe decided to try it out.  It exceeded our expectations!!  Well worth watching!
B005HS00V4|2.0|I'm a dedicated Peter Gabriel fan, and a huge fan of classical music of most stripes. This album was a disappointment as much of the music is not particularly well suited for such orchestration. A driving rhythm section is clearly needed for many of his songs as we remember them and I'm not sure they do very well re-imagined without them. I greatly respect Peter's artistry and compositions and I'm sure he wanted to do something different after so many years. However, I think if he had maintained the rhythm sections (and bass) with the orchestra, this would have been far more effective - to me.
B00742GBDM|1.0|First let me say that I'm a great fan of all these  old English romance movies. I own one or more copies of all these classics but this one I threw in the trash since I found it offensive. Mansfield Park is a good story and I've read the book twice but this particular attempt at a screen version is a waste of your money.  The acting is fair, the director must have been asleep and the scenery is weary. It works at being vulgar and is abusive which corrupts this story making it something it was never intended to be. If anyone knows of a good make of Mansfield Park I would love to purchase it. Sorry Amazon. You're a great place for movie purchases but not this one.
B007THA4FI|3.0|There are good and bad things about this book.  I'm not going to compare it to HP at all.  It's entirely different!<br /><br />On the good side, we get a lot of JKR's dry humor and interesting descriptions.  The way she reveals the world to readers is just sparkling and delightful (even if the world she is describing is not).  I also don't know if I've ever gotten so deeply into the heads of so large a cast of characters in a single book before.  That was new and interesting.  It was quite a feat to juggle so many people in one book without having it collapse in on itself.<br /><br />But I had a lot of issues with this story.  It's dirty and gruesome, which is fine, but it always seemed pointlessly dark.  I guess I didn't see the point of having so many despicable characters doing despicable things.  It's okay for characters to sometimes do bad things just because that is who they are, but I really don't want to imagine that there is a town somewhere in England where every single person is hateful, vindictive, selfish, violent, etc.  I could tell that we were supposed to be sad at the end of the story, but it just felt so...pointless.  I also refused to believe in the sudden change in attitude that a few of the characters showed at the end.  They did not earn it.  It just magically fell from the sky and hit them on the head that maybe, just maybe, they should try to get around to being not so horrible.  If they did not care about the person who suffered at the end of the story before her tragedy, why would they care afterwards?<br /><br />I feel a little sheepish to admit it, since no one else seems to be saying it, but I actually had trouble following the perspective of this story.  For example, you would have a family sitting at a dinner table.  For a few paragraphs, you'd be in the mother's head.  Then it would switch to the son with no warning, and then the father.  I read this on the Kindle, and I was starting to wonder if maybe in the book there was some kindof indication on the page to warn you about POV shifts, and those warnings did not get included in the Kindle format.  I've never read something where the perspective dances around the room like a ball following text in a sing along tape, and I have read a lot of books.  It was distracting.  Sometimes I had to reread paragraphs to figure out whose head I was in.<br /><br />So, I loved some things and hated others.  I guess it balances out to \\"it was okay.\\"
B00785P2QC|3.0|awesome, but u need so much money to buy the buildings for the accomplishments and the garbage trunks do not always work while your. away from the game
B005LAIHY0|4.0|Let me say from the start that the film just looks amazing on the big screen and I am sure that the Blu-ray will do it justice. The special effects are cutting edge and overall fit well into the storyline and the production design is top-notch.<br /><br />I must admit that I am a big Ridley Scott fan. He pretty much re-invented the \\"serious\\" science-fiction genre with Alien and Blade Runner and I have loved nearly all of his films since. But overall I was somewhat disappointed with Prometheus.<br /><br />As others has observed, this does not follow the general formula of the other films in the Alien series -i.e. plucky heroine battling and winning out over one/many Aliens (depending on the film), but attempts to provide an origin story for the Alien creatures as well as an origin story for the human race. This is quite a ambitious goal, which I think the film only partially pulls off.<br /><br />***SPOILERS***There are several plot points that I found somewhat confusing.<br />(1) The location of the crashed alien ship I had wrongly assumed was the same planet as from the original Alien film. But no - this is a different crashed alien ship on a different planet.<br />(2) The large humanoid creatures that apparently seed planets with DNA at the beginning of the film, suddenly decide to wipe out humanity at the end of the film with no rational explanation as to their motivation.<br />(3) The death of the humanoid creatures shown as a hologram to the science team is unexplained. Were they killed by something mutated from the cargo they were carrying or something else that had invaded their ship?<br />(4) The Weyland senior character and his android proxy seem to be privy to information on the use of the DNA material found on the ship that none of the science crew have and have a plan to use it to extend the life of Weyland senior by spiking the drink of one of the crew ?? Huh..???<br />(5) The DNA material suddenly starts to mutate into the snake reptile creatures in the humanoid's ship because the temperature of the room starts to increases! So the humanoids are able to build vast spaceships and have extensive control over DNA, but cannot build good air conditioning??<br /><br />I enjoyed Michael Fassbender's character which is played with a mix of whimsey and menace and is by far the best part of the film. If there are indeed sequels planned, then I would enjoy seeing development of his character.<br /><br />Would I recommend someone watch the film? Yes. It is an adult sci-fi film with many good moments and plenty of eye-candy. But comparing this against some of Ridley's other work, I would if possible give 3.5 stars.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This is a great first hand account from someone who was actually there. It is not the spin put out by the White House, who would have you think Obama pulled the trigger.  This brave man, like real most people who are actually doing the job points out that the interference and indecision by those running the show make their jobs a great deal more difficult and dangerous. The photos of Obama and company in the situation room are like LBJ's sand box of Khe Shan, a war should be run by the people fighting it, not the politicians. I can only wonder if those photos of the White House situation room would have been published if the mission had failed and we ended up with 20 dead SEALS. A fascinating read, definitely something you should get before you vote.
B0001ARCFA|5.0|AKG K240's are semi-open, so many people don't use them in broadcast applications, because feedback can be a problem if you get near a \\"live\\" microphone.  I do use K-240's for radio, and don't have the feedback issue, since I don't keep my headphone volume cranked up to super-high levels.  The sound and build quality are top-notch, and the comfort provided by AKG's self-adjusting headband has to be experienced to be appreciated.  I highly recommend these headphones.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Book one in the Trilogy is awesome and the others aren't bad at all either. I literally read all three of the books in 2.5 days and after reading Meet Fifty Shades at the end of book 3 I can't wait for the finished project. I had went by a few of the comments I read and decided against it but my friends neighbor had a copy and let me skim through his and I instantly fell in love. I have no clue what these people and the negative comments are about, I thoroughly enjoyed each of these books. You may as well get them all at once because you are going to want to know what happens again and again. [[ASIN:0345803485 Fifty Shades of Grey: Book One of the Fifty Shades Trilogy]][[ASIN:0345803493 Fifty Shades Darker: Book Two of the Fifty Shades Trilogy]][[ASIN:0345803507 Fifty Shades Freed: Book Three of the Fifty Shades Trilogy]]
B007IXWKUK|1.0|This book was disappointing.  I read \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\" to see what all of the hype was about, and while the story is somewhat juvenile, the sex scenes were hot enough to keep me reading.  Book two delves further into their immature romance while losing the kinkiness of the sexual encounters.  Yes, there are still plenty of sex scenes but they are gratuitous and boring.  The characters become unlikeable as the book starts to focus too much on his weakness (bring the Dom back please) and Anna's annoying tendancy to be the damsel in distress (are we reading Twilight?)  This book lacked plot and the romance is implausible unless you are a teenager and don't have any real romantic experience.  Won't read the 3rd book.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|very addicting game that is just like the real thing. great way to past time especially when waiting in line etc...
B007THA4FI|1.0|The novel is hugely disappointing.  JK Rowling was not served well by her editors. The work is over-full of static, rather stock, characters. The descriptive passages are bloated.  It is overly-emotive yet strangely flat. At the same time, the plot hardly moves forward.  I read about half of it with a kind of horrified fascination, as one looks at a train-wreck, but finally had to put it down.  I hope that her next novel will show more of the tight plotting and drama of the Harry Potter series.
B008TMA1LY|4.0|Your typical genre, only cuter. The only thing I would love to see in this game is queued commands. Otherwise, I'm glad I installed it.
B009A3NGF4|5.0|I'm an avid Texas Country Music fan, but every once and a while I hear a group/artist outside that genre that I really enjoy, Mumford&Sons is one of those that I knew were going to impress--and they have not let me down. The new album is solid especially for a second one, it seems as though they are a group that will continue to grow artistically and only become better with studio experience, that's why they're currently on rotation on my music list, I can't get enough of their music, if you enjoyed the first album, it's a no brainer; invest in this one too!!
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I keep waiting to get sick of it... But it NEVER happens! This game is simple *and* challenging *and* FUN!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Although it was an excelent book I ended up buying a hard copy because there were glitches in the copy on my kindle and I was not able to finish reading it.  The glitches were fixed but I had already finished reading the hard copy I bought.
B00479SVBU|5.0|About a year ago I bought my first Soundfly AUX fm transmitter.  It is absolutely superb.  I happily threw out the lousy fm transmitter that I had previously bought for under $10 and which gave more static than music.  This Soundfly is well worth the additional cost.  It has full, rich sound, absolutely no static, a strong FM signal that the car radio picks up perfectly, and is very sturdy and well made.  Now I bought a second one for my other car.  The online listing doesn't mention it, but the Soundfly has not only an AUX Input, to be used for input to it from other music sources, but also has an AUX Output, that can be used if your car has an AUX port for the car radio.  I really like that the Soundfly outputs the song title and artist to my car radio, which I can see on the radio's display.  It's a great product that I highly recommend.
B005LAIHSQ|4.0|I had seen this movie at the theatre, which encouraged me to purchase this video, when it came out.  I was not disappointed at all. Charlise Theron was perfect as the Queen.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I really like this game even though I'm alittle to old for it. Still I play it and still enjoy it! I do suggest this for really any age! :)
B004BLJQOK|4.0|Let Me In or Let the Right One In, take your pick.<br /><br />I am a firm believer that remakes, unless made superior to the original, are patently redundant, especially when there is no perceptible difference between the two.  Except for the cast, language, and a title improvement, there isn't much of a variation between these two films to warrant a remake.<br />A glutton for punishment, I've watched both (and given both away afterwards).<br />I found both films haunting and was overwhelmed by a lingering sadness from each.  I preferred the American title only because it made more sense.  I also loved the score by Michael Giacchino in the American version.  I thought the cinematography by Greig Fraser was brilliant.  The cast couldn't be improved on, Kodi Smit-McPhee, Chloe Grace Moretz, and Elias Koteas were all heartbreaking in their performances.<br />Now comes the dilemma.  On one hand, I applaud the artistry that went into both films but on the other hand, I can't say I actually enjoyed watching either, nor do I ever want to see either of them again.  So how to I rate this version?  It's well made but I didn't like it.  It's one thing to appreciate art for what it is, quite another thing to have it hanging in your home.  In this case, I'll err on the side of art.
B001NLL8LA|3.0|This is the 4th or 5th Reacher y read in the past months, and the one with fewer action scenes... as a matter of fact, just one at the end.... i was hoping for more
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Seduction and sex, that's all I got from this elementary story.  When was it going to happen and what strange place was it going to happen at and how kinky can it get.<br />Sorry I need more meat to my books.  Like Ken Follet's book that has history interwoven into the story.<br />Thats my opinion.
B008Y1RTUG|3.0|Good movie, but not really worth the purchase.  I was expecting a little more out of this movie.  You are better off renting it.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I've been playing this for months and I'm hooked! Maybe if those people who get sucked into actually buying gems would read things before they hit ok or yes automatically... I do not get them during game play only when I first open the game. Never had an accidental purchase. Great game. Yes it needs some tweeks but no app is perfect.
B003B02O3C|5.0|Another great book by Grisham. Although, not a new book, this is the first time I read it.  It is great and held my attention throughout.
B000IZXR20|5.0|This is a fun horror story, full of oddities and action. I thought it was really creative and unique. I'm a big horror buff, so the fact that I couldn't predict everything that was coming up next was a plus. I liked the variety of characters, and the interesting setting/dialogue really added to it. It was also nice to have a villain who wasn't a resurrected evil human or psycho killer. The ending was delightfully campy, which can be bad for some, but I think it's fun to have a little giggle every now and then. It's just the right amount of dark with a sprinkling of funny. Good fun.
B007QPFGJW|5.0|After using up the Henning Mankell / Kurt Wallander series (with its exquisite though sad perfect ending) I've moved on to other Nordic options, including Jo Nesbo. I thought \\"The Snow Man\\" was firtst-rate, and \\"The Phantom\\" a worthwhile follow-up/continuation. Harry Hole doesn't drink as much coffee as Kurt Wallander--Next novel I'll count his (& those he \\"borrows\\") cigarettes.
B008E8XV56|4.0|I enjoyed reading Zero Day. The story is interesting and made me not want to stop reading. Without being a masterpiece, it's well worth reading.
B008XBCJ34|4.0|Well I guess everyone that's interested in the movie has purchased it by now and for the rest of you \\"hold outs\\" waiting for the price to drop down to $4.99, you'll have to wait a little longer or buy a used one. If for some reason you haven't seen this movie it's basically the same story line. Our main character starts off with a selfish agenda, meets the locals along with the best looking girl in the village, begins to sympathize with them and turns on his benefactors.<br /> If you like westerns that show both the Native Americans defending their land and the Calvary slaughtering them with advanced weaponry, you should enjoy this.<br /> This movie also points out the symbiotic relationship the natives have with the planet, everything is connected. Kind of like it is here in the real world, or could be if not for corporate greed. This movie shows that you can make anyone your enemy and justify war if they have something you want.<br /> The planet is beautiful and the creatures are magnificent, the special effects to me are well done.<br /> I bought the single DVD as soon as it hit the shelves, but after reading a few of these reviews, I may have to pick up the extended version.<br /> REMEMBER!  Be kind to animals, we are their voice.<br />  Thanks, Goodcat.
1878424319|5.0|I absolutely loooove this book. I received it as a gift many years ago, and it really helped me prioritize my emotional life. I have since given it as a gift many times over. I highly recommend it!!!!!!!
B000UNYK76|5.0|The setlist is just amazing, the quality is superB and all the Pearl Jam's great feelings is shown right here.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|I enjoyed reading A WANTED MAN as I have read most of Lee Child's fiction but this one was starting to make me carsick!  So much of it took place in cars, driving and on roads and places I knew nothing about and didn't really learn too much about either.  I truly like Jack Reacher but this book was not as good as most of the others.
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|it keeps telling me &quot;my payment method need a US credit card&quot; even though i already have! ! what can i do? i really want to play! ! HELPPP
B0071XO8RA|5.0|What a great series!  I just finished reading the Wool Omnibus and was blown away!  I love finding a great author and Hugh Howey doesn't dissapoint!  Wow! It was so awesome that I couldn't put it down!  I'm going straight onto First shift right now!  Thanks for another great story!  I would've paid a lot more for this, because it's sooooo worth it!
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Overall the game has great graphics... The puzzles are challenging and the gameplay is always filled with plot twists... It definitely is worth the 1.99 price... If you don't have it... get it!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is the best Bible app that I have ever known in all times. Although I have to say that I was disappointed when I found out that you need Internet connection too use it. I recommend this app.
B005LAIHY0|5.0|Unlike the Alien movies, this movie had me on the edge of my seat. Not quite frightened exactly, but more than uneasy. I like that feeling. Growing up in the era of \\"Videodrome\\" and \\"The Entity\\", I have been pretty much desensitized to scary movies. Whatever you want to call it, I did not move from my seat for the entire movie, did not nod off, like i sometimes do watching movies at home, and did not answer the phone when it rang because I didn't want to break the momentum or miss anything.<br /><br />Highly recommend watching it, except for children.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I enjoyed reading the last book.  It makes you think and appreciate our life today. iI hope we never live to see it come true
B009FOBMBI|4.0|As a really fan of their album Life Starts Now, this CD is a bit of a disappointment in comparison. While a solid CD and worth the purchase in my view, I would try some of the songs out first. Some songs grow on you and ultimately make it a good CD but I can't give it unmitigated praise.
B000002W9Q|5.0|Film was a slow burner but now it's a must have and with an Iconic CD of the soundtrack to go with it
B008VBYN80|5.0|this is a great game to have fun with and pass time, somewhat challenging. cant stop playing. the city development is very cool only thing I find a negative is the amount of energy you have to collect your goods.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this game. It has enough levels that have kept me engaged and challenged, but the easy ones make me happy too!
B000069HJL|5.0|Great disc set. The exact concert line up from Supertramps tour at the pinnacle of their careers.<br /><br />  I saw the tour in Seattle and it is one of my all time top 5 concert experiences of my life.  Brings back fond and warm memories of that place and time in 1979.  Fantastic set of songs and all Supertramps hits.  Highly recommended!
B003P2VCOS|4.0|Reservations be dammed! That's right, I almost didn't read it.<br /><br />  Ever wonder what's going to become of those \\"@$(^$#%\\" kids in your basements playing video games?  Well, Suarez has found a place for them and he makes it count. No same old plot line here, you know, the good, the bad and the ugly? Just when your standard character is lined up to save the day--pow! Right in the kisser. You're hanging a U-turn. What the hell was that? And trust me, you want to know where this one is going. And it won't be where you thought. Just when you think Suarez has stretched technology to the limit, and even a bit beyond, you find out there is more out there and it's being done. Who knew?<br /><br />  You take your not so typical megalomaniac (Mathew Sobol), throw in the fact that he's dead, add a pinch of global data mining, GPS guidance systems, computer-generated and programmed manufacturing machines, international banking, global economics, CIA, FBI, name the agency it's in there.  Then peel and dice a willing and ready disenfranchised subculture. Simmer slowly with inherent, but predictable corporate greed base. You get the idea, or you will.  Sobols plan seems to have predicted the most basic human behavior and uses it to stay one step ahead. Have you ever had the urge to hit the gas when the patrol car's lights come on behind you, all the while knowing you'll never outrun his radio? Try outrunning a powerful computer or thousands and you'll get somewhat of an idea of what all those institutions are up against.<br /><br />  You don't do Tech? Well me either, that's why I almost skipped this one. Suarez delivers a plot, plausible characters, and writing that brings a flavor to tech we can actually digest and dare I say, appreciate. There's no small thinking here; Suarez's writing is engaging and his ideas are current and provoking. There was a good chance that this book was going to get the five stars out of me but................................<br /><br />The book just ended, kind of like this review. Grrrrrhhhhh!<br /><br />He got me. Damn, I want that second book.
B0072OFOM6|5.0|I enjoyed this series of Spartacus very much. Can't wait for the next series! Worth buying and watching over and over.
B008XBCJ34|3.0|I saw the Theatrical 3D version in theaters, I saw the Theatrical Version on DVD, I saw the Extended Edition on Blu Ray, and I saw the Theatrical Version on Blu Ray 3D. The only thing missing? There is no Extended Edition in 3D.  WHY?!<br /><br />I know that they shot the entire movie using 3D cameras. So, did they use regular old tape recorders for the extended footage? They should have had the Extended Edition with the 3D edition from the start. Sure, they could have had just a regular old 3D version without the extras like they have here, but they should have had the Extended Edition with it too.<br /><br />5 stars for Quality of 3D, 5 stars for the movie, 1 star for stupidity. I do not know how this mathematically averages, but I'm giving it 2 stars.<br /><br />Edit: Ok, 3 stars
B00992CF6W|2.0|The 0.4 version is missing so much there isn't a lot to do and it just isn't that fun.  The world is tiny and the controls are too sensitive.  I also had to turn my brightness way up to see stuff well.<br /><br />Could be a good mobile game but it needs a lot of updating first.
B009K45Y62|5.0|Why does it say 2 disc's come with it but in the picture there's 3? I know there's a 3 disc version but I want this one with the cowl I think it looks cool I just hope it's come's with 3 disc not 2. Has anyone else noticed what i'm talking about?
0525952926|4.0|This continuation is easily read as a first installment. The writing style draws you on into the book and the story line is close enough toreality to keep you happy with the story. I look forward to the next book!
B003WJQ74E|5.0|This story should be read by every literate person, and its content thought about and reflected upon. I'm normally not one to get swept with emotion from a fictional story, but some of the treatment of Charlie by his \\"friends\\" would infuriate me almost to the point of wanting violence for Charlie. Our attitudes toward the less fortunate range from ignorance to vile, and everything in between and we should respect everyone even if it seems they cannot tell the difference between respect or disgust. That is just one level of the nuance of this story, another being our aspirations may sometimes leave us in worse condition after achieved, so be careful what you wish for, and the is a Don Quixote reference and definite similarities in the stories. This is one of my all time favorite stories.
030758836X|5.0|This is the first book I can say I have truly devoured in a very long time. I could not/would not put it down. Without giving too much away, it was great to read a book without a true protagonist or antagonist. If you like a story with twists and turns and leaves you wanting more, I highly recommend.  Many have been disappointed in the ending. The ending leaves the reader room to draw his/her own conclusion OR leaves opportunity for a sequel/series. I highly recommend this book.
0800141849|5.0|This movie was a great surprise to me.  I love it! Should have bought<br />two , I know I'll watch it over and over again.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|the game is fun to play but expense. it is fun when you have a friend to play it with. and I love to play
B0083SBMBM|1.0|it was very bad way i recieved package very trashy! it was meant as a christmas gift i sent it back and got it else where...
B007SGM084|5.0|These books were impossible to put down. This journey watching a love story develop is uniquely written, but the healing of a broke n soul pulls the reader in to the point you cannot get enough of this story.  I will impatiently await the next book revealing Christians story. There is no way a movie can capture the torment and feeling these books reveal. But I will attempt to be first in line to watch to see if they can.  E.L. James is one talented lady.
B004I1AGTC|5.0|Best movie ever!!!!! You simply will not find a modern martial artist of this caliber these days. Any fan of the arts should watch this ASAP
B00275EGX8|5.0|Movie is delivered with great acting and shows the human drive to do what you love even if you have to sacrifice a lot to do it.  I could get more into with the action and the warfare but that alone makes it a must own!
B000URWYTS|4.0|I loved the story because i knew nothjng about the man other than his architecture. A facinating story about brave prople willing to follow their heart consequences be damned. I was envious of that at  times!
B002ZG98UA|2.0|I received this dvd real fast, just in time for the release of the new movie. I enjoyed it until I saw they stole scenes from Matrix at the end of the movie, it was very dissapointing seeing that they run out of creativity. Oh well.<br /><br />It is enjoyable.
B0091CWYQ6|5.0|This little device is a home-run on too many levels.<br /><br />The amp is not super powerful, but works perfectly to help boost sound for headphones.  The difference with or without this amp is very noticeable.  It's small and feels like a quality product in your hand.  It charges full in about an hour, and lasts for almost 8 hours on the same charge!  The microphone makes it easy to take calls when I am listening to music, and having volume and play controls directly on the amp is simply genius.<br /><br />Truly, a great product for anyone who wants great headphones for a smartphone.
B000002513|5.0|I've been waiting for Bruce to give me something as great as his mostly ignored second album, \\"The Wild, the Innocent & The E Street Shuffle.\\"  \\"Born to Run\\" is deservedly prestigious, with inspiring power pieces like \\"Jungleland.\\"  Though this album established Bruce's rock 'n' roll format for the future, for me it was a step down from the incredible genius creativity, the sophistication, the fusion of genres of rock, soul & jazz captured with \\"The Wild & Innocent.\\"<br /><br />With the Grammy nomination for \\"The Rising\\" and the immensity of the 9/11 American experience as its format, I anticipated that the musical splendor of that second album might again be acheived.  \\"The Rising\\" is a very good work, but, alas, falls short in comparison.<br /><br />\\"Wrecking Ball\\" was highly touted by Jimmy Fallon when Bruce appeared on his show.  Jimmy knows good music.  I am slowly coming to agree with him as this album continues to grow on me.  It most certainly speaks to our current hard times of financial recession, unemployment, and the privileged aristocrat thieves who viciously continue to rape and plunder the world economy.  The simplicity of the lyrics, with their bluntness, strong metaphorical imagery and subtle calls of hope and deliverence, work dynamically with the stark melodies to give us all reason to have heart and persevere for that better day.  The album is so good that the fascinating \\"Swallowed Up\\" is presented as a bonus track on the \\"Special Edition.\\"<br /><br />But, for pure musical brilliance, \\"The Wild and Innocent\\" still stands alone.  And probably always will.  True classics never die.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|this app is colorful, easy to use, and contains much useful data on battery status and longevity for various kindle activities<br /><br />recommend highly
B007KDFWRG|4.0|Instant classic-\\"Midnight Up In Harlem\\" can be found on DVD, Clapton's \\"Crossroads\\" 2010, for those of you who, like myself, wanted a DVD disc. Derek Trucks can be seen AND heard on the Allman Brothers Band's \\"Live @ the Beacon [2010]. His guitar duets with Warren Haynes are reproduced with his wife on this CD. I saw Susan in Seattle's Central Tavern '98 or so, after \\"Just Won't Burn\\" [for $6!] and she brings some of that blues band energy to the stage here. I wondered how long she'd be able to sing like that before shredding her vocal cords, but she seems to have survived those days nicely. Much fuller context here, with horns and backing vocals and, of course, Derek's gorgeous guitar lines. Retro sound [too retro for some reviewers?], but my only complaint is the music-not enough of it! If you're going to do a live 2 disc set, give us 160 minutes. Late '60s-early '70s references: Genya Raven and 10 Wheel Drive, a group called Smith, Cold Blood and \\"Kosmic Blues\\".
B000ICZD4I|5.0|Great Movies need to made more movies like this............. and good feel movies and good laugh and cry..Could watch it over and over again. I well watch it over and over
0060853972|5.0|Best collaboration ever, by two giants of fantasy. It reads like Douglas Adams's Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, but substitute Milton and the Book of Revelations in place of robots and spaceships.
B003O86FMW|3.0|If you liked the hunger games, than this will not be a total disappointment.  Lets just say there was no real WOW factor, or suspense, or character development (oh like the first book).  This is a very easy read, with little left to the imagination.  On to the 3rd book now. Why? Why Not.  Might as well finish what has been started.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|This book was riviting. I rented it through Kindle Prime and I couldn't put it down. Like other reviewers I did not anticipate the ending. I don't want to give to much away but if you're interested in a fast pace read with plenty of suprises you should check this book out. Great book! Cannot wait to read more of Mr. Crouch.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Love this book. Definitely recommend!!! Fell in love with Gideon!!!! Can't wait for next book!!Could not put this book down. I finished it and am now reading it for the second time!!
B006GWO5NE|4.0|This cable worked as intended with no issues. It allowed me to download a file from the kindle onto a computer and from there onto a flash drive. In this case, the file was an updated version of my wife's medications and her health history, emergency contacts, doctors etc. This was then used to update the medical emergency flash drive she has on a lanyard around her neck.
B008MM9630|5.0|I am having lots of fun so far no problems and I can look forward to hours of play. the story graphics and speed are wonderful
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|This is the first app I've ever felt compelled to leave a review for. I really like this game. Great graphics, runs smooth, nice sounds and addicting gameplay. Its never crashed on me, it auto-saves my progress and I love how colorful it is. I got it free, but it's more than worth the price. Highly recommended!
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Very challenging, very fun, worth the $, time flies, hard to put down. Definately recommend if you like this style of game. Well done and good graphics.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I just finished reading Wool Omnibus, and I am so sad to reach the end. The entire time I have been reading the story of Juliette and Silo 18, I feel like I have been living in another world so long as I just keep reading. I could not put this story down, and look forward to the next installment. Hugh Howey is a captivating storyteller, and I am officially a fan.
B0059XTUB8|4.0|It is, of course, impossibly difficult to emulate an icon on screen. Marilyn herself had difficulty reconciling herself versus her image during life. Williams does a good job, occasionally a spot on job in her role as Marilyn. However, it is hard to fully enjoy a movie on Marilyn when the character in the movie who has the most \\"it\\" factor onscreen, the most audience magnetism and beauty is not the Marilyn character. Watson does a wonderful job in her underused role. More relationship back and forth between the \\"Third\\" and his two love interests would have strengthened the movie and made it more poignant.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|The game reminds me of school when we played on an apple 2e.  It is a decent game, especially for free.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|addictive puzzle game. challenging and engaging. a must play for people who love match three puzzle games like bejeweled.  recommended!
B007N8RULO|5.0|I have this game with me all the time.Passes the time waiting.which we all do. I have even spent hours relaxing with spider solitaire. It is always fun. Extremely easy to use.
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|Shrantaram is a seductive adventure of an escaped convict from Australia making his way through the slums of Bombay, building clinics and schools for the slum dwellers, melding his heart and philosophies between India's many different religions and a guru mafia don, who takes him into the heart of 1980's Afghanistan and Russian war, supplying the mujaheddin resistance. This is the first book that I've read in a long time that melded a great adventure, with love, philosophy, and a peak into an exotic kaleidoscope of cultures. I highly recommend it.
0756666937|5.0|A thorough look at the history of Lego. The book covers the beginning of Lego and the various sets over the years. My boys (8 and 12) love it!
B0067RQYNW|3.0|Uninstalled! There is a terrible lag when I pair my bluetooth keyboard with my HTC EVO. I can finish typing a sentence on my keyboard and its only halfway through on the screen. Then I have to go back and fix any mistakes. Otherwise it has some great features compared to other apps.
B009329Y30|4.0|I think the story line was good but get rid of the sex scenes. I liked the actor selection. They were believable.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|The charachters are so raw and sweet at the same time. Although this book made me laugh and get angry at some of the stupid mistakes men can make, it was a good story. Full of emotion, pain, and love.
B009329ZF2|1.0|no comments, dont lose your money and time for this stupid movie, silly movie for silly pepole, better than this is even reading dictionary
B004RJMUJO|4.0|This is a hood game but after awhile it becomes tedious. I guess there is a limit on how many fruit I can slice and still be entertained.<br /><br />The game and graphics are good. The sounds are great and it is fun to earn different blades and backgrounds.
B00065MDRW|2.0|The title track is the only good song.  The others are just mindless crap that drone on and on and have no value.
B004UID2LC|5.0|its really good :) lets me download all of my music ( which is a lot, trust me) and works smoothly. Sure its had a couple of rough patches ( gahh I sound like a relationship adviser) but over all its a really good app. and on my kindle fire it downloaded them into the music department which is amazing :D
B004XDYJRU|3.0|This app is, at minimum, two versions behind the one on the Google Play Store. It needs to be updated soon.
B00846REIS|4.0|I was blown away by the fifty shades trilogy... but this was better!!! definitely a must read.   cant wait for the second one
B0088WK6CE|5.0|On first listen, I thought the songs were too spare.  But listening to it a few more times, I recognized that they were just right.  The songs are stripped down, beautiful and powerful.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I read this novel during the Dewey Readathon, and it was an excellent choice the second book in the Hunger Games Series.<br /><br />Synopsis:<br />Katniss and Peeta have survived the games, and have returned to District 12.  Katniss now has a home in Victor's Village for her mother and her sister.  She has all the money she could ever need.  You would think that she would be happy, but she still prefers her old stomping grounds outside of the district.  Peeta is around and still wishes for more from Katniss.  Does she have it to give?  One day President Snow pays Katniss a visit threatening all that is sacred and important to her.  Can she pull off the ultimate deception convince the Public that she absolutely adores Peeta or will rebellion break out?  What are her true feelings?<br /><br />My Thoughts:<br /><br />I enjoyed this novel and wasn't too surprised with the direction the plot took.  One question that I asked myself will Katniss end up in another games maybe as a mentor?  I was wrong with where I thought the plot was heading in this novel.  I will not spoil it for the rest of you.  Ms. Collins takes this plot in a different direction then what was expected to prepare readers for the final novel Mockingjay.  I maintain my position that Suzanne Collins is a great storyteller.<br /><br />I was a little disappointed with the direction of the story.  I had hoped that Katniss would get some relief from the games  I still very much enjoyed this novel but not as much as the first.
B0045EJY90|2.0|Item was purchased to connect to soundboard. Look ar images saw connections didi not know that the conections wast out only. returned item. Purchased another TEAC product to meet our need.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Book is very captivating and will leave you ready for the next one in the series.  You will find yourself rooting for these two characters to make it through their trials and tribulations of how to make a loving relationship work.
B00003CXXS|5.0|I absolutly love this film, and yes I know everyone thinks that it couldn't possibly be any good because it isn't 'newly evoloved' or whatever that means, but the new characters and everything in this film is quite a little addicting for me. I love the Jurassic Park series, the second being my least favorite but i still like it. So watch with an open mind...and see it for yourself.
0060873175|3.0|I lost my enthusiasm for this story when a scientist who lives in the micro world appeared.<br /><br />In my opinion, the time limit is one of the most important elements in thrillers, and it makes the story nail-biting. In this novel shrunken people need to resume their size within several days. If not, they will self-destruct. Avoiding and often fighting with the huge creatures in the rainforest, they have to listen to the ticking of a kind of time bomb set in their body. This situation is really thrilling like the classic movie \\"Fantastic Voyage\\".<br /><br /> However, without convincing explanations the scientist has solved the problem of self-destruction, and he has been enjoining somewhat comfortable life in the micro world. Although the remedy of self-destruction isn't easy and the author continues to mention crisis, the sense of urgency has been lost totally and my enthusiasm as well.<br /><br /> I think that until chapter 39 the story is a good thriller but after that it suddenly becomes extremely boring.
B0057RCFQS|5.0|I used to own a trilogy back in 2005-2006 I beleive, on dvd. However when I was looking to obtain it again I found this in it's place complete will all the digital copies. It claimed to have been remastered picture and audio and I was very unsure if it was worth the 30, however it was for the movies alone, but the picture is BEAUTIFUL! The audio is just like watching it at the theathres. I love it and if you're a fan then you will too!!!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Love it! one of the best books ever!! i recomend this to all PercycJackson lovers!! Dont hesitate to order this book
0061969656|3.0|I am a great fan of Cornwell and hischronicles of Uhtred (a Saxon raised by Vikings) are among his best work. His refreshing cynicism regarding King Alfred and the early church is always a welcome exception to most historical fiction and his command of both the background and the military tactics of the period are as good as ever. However, I detect a certain tiredness. Uhtred keeps on stressing his desire to reconquer his family holdings in the North but we keep on being stuck in the South. I can't help a feeling that, like so many others, Cornwell is stretching the series out (Stirling is probably the worst offender writing at the moment although Jordan's Wheel of Time series takes the all time prize).
B006O6F932|3.0|This playset was easy to put together, but the tubes for the picnic table-style cafeteria table did not click into place, so they keep coming apart.  It unfolds from a compact carrying-case style and hooks together, and my daughter can mostly get it all connected herself, but some of the smaller parts, like the decorative jack o'lanterns and spiderwebs, do not want to stay in place.<br /><br />The playset has lots of extra little things, like a beaker for the science classroom, two high school desks, food for the cafeteria table, etc.<br /><br />Although the set is fun and good-looking, the flimsiness of the construction makes it 3 stars.
0525953728|4.0|I found this book informative on the lives of the military from the eyes of a Seal who was there and how they perform and train.
0316228532|4.0|I liked it.<br />Thats all i'm going to say, partly because nothing this women does--or writes-- is wrong in my eyes.<br />(giant fan, plus she's a huge inspiration of mine when it comes to writing.)<br />So i'm not even going to touch this one.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Ken Follet is one of my favorites writers. He gives you so much information about what had happened during the World War One without get you boring. You will get involved with all characters, filling really inside the play.
B000FCKGPC|3.0|The story is interesting. Not sure it needed to be so long for the very little it progressed overall, though. I am willing to forgive Martin for that because his writing is usually amazing. But boy, was I let down in that regard.<br /><br />One of my biggest pet peeves about lesser writers has plagued Martin this time around: frequent use of new vocabulary, like a new toy. I like new vocabulary, but it seems as though he'd find a new word and then use it several times in the same chapter rather than sprinkling it throughout the book. That gets obvious, like a kid trying to write an adult-sounding essay. It jolted me out of the story every time. I noticed it a few times in the other books, but this was over the top. If you're a picky-word reader, you've been warned. But you will pick up some new fancy-pants words.<br /><br />I felt there was a real shift in this book in a lot of ways. The dialogue and language seemed more stylized, for no reason that I could fathom. Many, MANY more characters we never really meet are brought up. I'm glad you made a family tree for that obscure bunch of people, but if it doesn't change the plot or a character's motivations, I don't care that much. Also, much more vulgarity, often for no apparent reason. If it's integral to the story, fine, otherwise it seems like sensationalism in order to sell books.<br /><br />Also, all of a sudden there are many \\"mysterious\\" things. Ooooo, set it up and tell me more. Or not. Because he didn't.<br /><br />Some of the characters appear to have undergone a complete personality change between books. Jaime's you can probably justify to me, but Cersei's is way off the charts. And what's with this prophecy? For something that supposedly shaped her as a person, it seems odd to just be bringing it up now. It felt like a plot device rather than a part of the character. I found the Cersei chapters hard to read since they just didn't make any sense in the context of what we already know about her. Toward the end it got extreme. I don't even love to hate her any more, it's just not fun. Cersei's personality transformation happens off stage, so some of her behavior doesn't make sense. We don't get to go on the journey despite the number of pages she takes up.<br /><br />Sansa, just not realistic. The whole play-acting thing was very juvenile, even for a juvenile. Either he wants us to believe that Sansa doesn't have much in the brains department or that girls in general can't pretend to be one thing while keeping their original identity intact. Same goes for Arya, but it wasn't done as obnoxiously forcefully.<br /><br />I am also a little tired of reading about how cheated the women in the book feel about the hand they've been dealt. Martin had better come up with a kick-butt female story line after all the setting up or I will have wasted reading hundreds of words about it. I get it, it stinks being a woman in that kind of society. How about a little more show and a little less tell? The internal whining made me want to tell them to suck it up or fix it. Note to Martin: women don't really whine that much to themselves in their heads. The pity party doesn't go on for that long in real life. Maybe the women rule in the next book, but I don't care as long as they don't whine about it.<br /><br />There were some high points. Samwell Tarly, for one. I could read a whole book about that oaf, though he's got to stop being so clueless. Life comes with lessons, and he seems immune to learning from his experiences. I enjoyed some of Arya's story, too. Brienne was interesting when she wasn't internally whining.<br /><br />I know other people complain about the detail that Martin usually gives to clothing and food, but I missed the food. Yes, I know food is harder to come by now and everyone's dirty and tired. I didn't realize how much I liked the food descriptions until they were gone!<br /><br />I would love to see the publisher add a small map of the area or a little link in the text to the map when places are mentioned, at least the first time in a chapter. When you read a physical book you can flip back and forth. When you read a digital book it's a pain if it's not linked. Since the stories are spread all over the place geographically, a little link love would be nice. I finally decided I could do without knowing where these things were taking place. I'll look it up later if it seems like it's important.<br /><br />All of this said, I do intend to read the next book. And the one after that, until the end. Unlike another large fantasy series that shall remain unnamed, I have hopeful confidence that Martin will bring his A-game to the final volumes. I pray for his continued good health, and that he doesn't find any new words to abuse repeatedly.
B005LAJ212|5.0|OMG..I missed this first season but all my friends said it was amazing so I bought the season. I am now watching season for the second time as there is so much I missed, I am not gonna watch season 2 but am gonna wait and order t from here as soon as it becomes available. This set arrived on time and was in the sealed package..perfect condition.
034580404X|5.0|It came in a great packaging. The books were the same as anywhere else. It was so worth the money. Great books!
B007SYWFRM|4.0|It's fun. I enjoy all the different animals as they are accessed. It keeps me entertained and away from my day to day cleaning.
B008BTOVL6|2.0|The popularity of this show is modern mystery, though I suppose that just because E4 shows the entire series from beginning to end 5 times daily it doesn't exactly mean that anyone is actually watching it. The Big Bang Theory is so gratingly dated, using styles and techniques that went out of fashion in the early 90s and a character dynamic that didn't work with Joey but somehow is resuscitated by the agonizingly overenthusiastic laughing sheep in the audience. They try to cover it up with an overabundance of pop culture references but I'm not falling for it.<br /><br />None of the characters are all that likeable. Sheldon is an annoying pedant with almost no redeeming features. Howard cannot get through half a sentence (usually some lame sexual innuendo) without boring me to tears. Raj is never really given anything to do. Leonard fails as the 'straight man' to their weird antics, and his on/off/on/off/on/off/on/off/on/off relationship with Penny is more irritating than Ross Geller's 'we were on a break' schtick from Friends. None of these characters properly develop and the live-audience nature of the show gives every single line of dialogue an overly rehearsed feel turning many scenes in each episode into an unbearable ordeal.<br /><br />The Big Bang Theory is so phoney and false it's like acid in my face. Live-audience sitcoms are out of style. Laugh tracks in general are out of style. If it were not created by Chuck Lorre this aggravating crap would never have made it to the air.<br /><br />The two-star rating is merely for Kaley Cuoco's occasional pointy nipples.
B0083SBM7Q|1.0|No, sadly it wouldn't work on my dvd player...(very upset, crying myself to sleep at night, sometimes i just wish the lord would take me now)
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I didnt think that this game would be very interesting but I took a chance and actual I am fibding it a bit addictive
B006XF5BTG|5.0|I have been looking at buying several different books for possible bulking up.  This is the one I went with because he addresses both bulking and cutting.  I bought books back when I was 14 to see the exercises, I'm 25 now so I mainly buy the books for their diet advice now.  This book was filled with tons of dieting advice and much more than just dieting.  I'm someone who doesn't count calories.  I own the abs diet books which tell you it's not necessary to do so, but now I'm gonna be counting my calories, and if your like me, and don't count your calories just read this line from the book, and think about the meaning, \\"not counting your calories is like saying you want to drive across the country, but don't want to have to pay attention to your gas tank\\".  I do need to go back and read the book again because I purchased it, and read the whole book straight through,  I don't do that with fitness books, I usually skip around.  The author also makes himself available for any questions if you are to have them, which is nice for any questions regarding specifically to you.  I found that extremely helpful in the past with Fitness Model Gregg Avedon when I purchased his book.  He helped me with a lot of questions, so the fact the author offers his help is extremely beneficial.  Sorry this review was long, but I did it to help someone whose stuck between several books like me.  Thanks.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I couldn't put this book down, and I thought it continued the intriguing story, even though I was hesitant about how good it would be after the first book, and I wasn't disappointed! The third book was just as good!!
B000AOEMXM|1.0|I watched the first season,all 7 DVD were good,no problem at all,second season 3 episodes,were jumping from widescreen to full screen constantly.Sesason 3 all 7 DVDs jumping wide to full screen ,imposible to watch. I have to return all,even I am not going to open 4th season.I will order it from another source.
B0099G20PY|5.0|On the heels of seeing Andras Schiff perform the first book of the well-tempered clavier last night in Los Angeles, I was excited to purchase his new recording. Unfortunately I find after downloading the digital album from Amazon the artifacts of the variable bit-rate mp3 are so noticeable as to be utterly distracting. The music making on this recording is exceptional, but I cannot recommend the digital product as offered here at Amazon.<br /><br />Perhaps the nature of the recording (solo piano) makes this more apparent than on a pop record with electric guitars, drums, etc. If that is the case, where is the quality control Amazon? Perhaps a recording of this nature requires more attention than running it through the one-size-fits-all conversion process.<br /><br />I just visited the ECM website where you can stream the first prelude and fugue from disc one and they sound just fine. I also checked the \\"cloud player\\" to make sure it wasn't some corruption that occurred when I downloaded the files.<br /><br />The warble and stuttering is particularly noticeable on the following track:<br /><br />4-04 Das Wohltemperierte Klavier_ Book 2, BWV 870-893 - Fuge fis-Moll, BWV 883<br /><br />Please fix this Amazon, otherwise that's $37 down the drain (:-o)<br /><br />I can't recommend this product at all in its current state. Go buy the digital album somewhere else where they actually check to see that the compressed audio files are listenable.<br /><br />Anyone else hear what I'm hearing? Such a disappointment!<br />I'd ask for a refund, but I don't think that's possible with digital products.

B007HU7NBK|5.0|This is a very good book. I am also reviewing the Audible edition read by JT himself. In 1983 - 1985, I was synonymous with Duran Duran to anyone who saw me, but I wasn't a heartsick teeny bopper girl. I was a guy and a straight one at that.  This book takes me back to places in my mind I haven't touched in 27 years. It takes me to places I've never imagined and wouldn't have known about as a California kid. It takes us to the early beginnings of the wave scene in the late 1970s in England.  He expresses his self doubt and his early friendship with a kid named Nick Bates. They sound like a couple o' English lads experimenting and hoping for a real longshot of a dream. Except this dream comes true.<br /><br />By the mid 1980s (85-87), many bands filled the minds of alternative/waver kids like me - bands such as The Smiths, The Cure, Depeche Mode; but for me and a few of my close friends, only DD struck a certain chord. It's the end of summer and a girl I absolutely dig calls me out of no where to be her date to a party - that's Duran Duran. A note left in a locker by a 'secret admirer' that promises she'll introduce herself at a beach gathering on Friday if I come - Ray-Ban sunglasses and the smell of Coppertone suntan oil while lying on Zuma Beach - that's 'Rio'.<br /><br />Cemeteries and girls with black eyeliner coupled with weird, complicated feelings.  That's different. That's The Cure. You don't mix these.<br /><br />Their music is androgynous, hypnotic and danceable. Teens snapped it up instantly. Teens are by nature, androgynous, particularly waver boys. There's a transition - a softness and desire for love rather than sex - a poetic longing for a girl.  It only exists in its purest form for a few years as boys become men. It's hard to exactly explain what it is, but don't worry about it.  You'll find it in Duran Duran.<br /><br />JT felt this too. Here he is this tall model of a man with a gorgeous face in the biggest band on the planet, and he 'falls in love' with a girl he met at a hotel. Not just one but many of them.<br /><br />John knows Duran Duran was special; how could anyone deny it given their popularity. Well, popularity isn't everything. They were special beyond that, and I think he understands that too.  It's clear from his words that he was as surprised and thrilled by the ride as we fans were by their appearance and music. JT imparts the story of a band of musicians and a talented lyricist in Simon who were as spellbound by their ride as we were in watching them perform their fantastic songs. Is it really as awesome as we imagine it would be? A resouding 'Yes' at first. But with all things, nothing can stay that way for long. Life is more complicated than that, and a good English boy can get quickly caught up in the shadier parts.<br /><br />Part of what made them special was also the band themselves - their looks - their fashion - their makeup. Their newness. The newness of everything they did. As JT rightly notes, it was everything that made them so spectacular.  There are a few bands (less famous) on the same level at the same time - bands that impart a depth of feeling and beauty that rivals DD - such as the Psychedelic Furs - but not many. The Furs struck a different chord anyway - a darker one.<br /><br />The Smiths came later and created their own scene. They were post-wave. Maybe they were the first post-wave band. Following The Smiths was Suede in 1993. I think that's the succession. I'm sure a bunch of English purists will barf at that, but from the West Coast of the US, this is how I see it- and neither the Smiths nor Suede were able to smash the charts like Duran.  Duran is near the top of in a very deep field of English wave, and they got there very early on. There was nothing as hookish and synthy - and certainly as good looking - as Duran Duran back in 1982-1983-1984-1985, and JT, it turns out, is as decent a Catholic raised boy as you might imagine. Girls at the beach with androgynous boys - dancing - talking - falling in love. That's DD. It's 'Rio.'

B0052RDHTM|5.0|The fictional and  historical characters and woven together wonderfully.   The novel leads you through the lives of those struggling to survive while usurping a world dominated by Aristocrats.  A vivid glance into the transformation of lives thru political upheaval.
B000127LW2|5.0|The highlight for me was seeing the first episode-Caretaker. I did not see that episode while the series was on TV in syndication. So it was a treat seeing that episode for the first time. For me the best episodes for Season One was Caretaker because it introduces the series, the characters, and how two space vessels would wind up deep in the delta quadrant some 70,000 light years away from Earth. The second good episode was Parallax. Here we see how the Federation and Maquis crews are intergrated into one crew that will function really well together throughout the series.<br /><br />Also what sets this series apart from the other Star Trek series is the selection of a female captain-Kathryn Janeway. Throughout the series I would come to love her as the captain and she was a good one. I would have no problem serving under her and this is coming from someone who served in the military,<br /><br />There is a book that describes all the major characters. It gets into their life history to include events that leads to how they would wind up on Voyager. the book is titled Star Trek Voyager Pathways. If one wants to learn more about the major characters this book is worth checking out.<br /><br />As for the packaging it's not bad. Each disc is in it's own compartment. The one drawback is that the episode titles are not printed on the disc or the packaging. The only way one can learn the episode titles is to put the disc in the player. it is something I can live with. Also there were no problems with the discs after playing them. Also Amazon did it'd usual good job in getting the item to be in a timely manner. Again I used the no cost SuperSaver shipping. Once again good job.
B008XG1X18|5.0|great! super addicting. great to find clothes recipes and craft idea. it has everything!! I wish I had more free time to spend on it
B007SGM084|5.0|Wow finally a grown up book for women, actually words that are more the 4 letters long and boy can she write. If I could of lost my virginity that way maybe I would look forward to having sex, more then I do.  WOW.

B000NQRE9Q|5.0|The movies are great the visuals look amazing and the audio is top notch!! It's a must own for any fan!
0812550706|4.0|Ender's Game is basically about a bunch of child geniuses who are being trained to defend the world against the bugger aliens and six year old Ender is the smartest of them all. The early training takes the place of games, little mock battles.<br /><br />The book did a good job of holding my interest and I liked the story. There were several things in the book that bugged (er, bothered) me. For one, the children that are supposed to save the world are really young, Ender himself starts training at age six. But they don't act like children, maybe that's the point, but it didn't seem believable. Even if I can buy that they don't think or talk like children because they are geniuses, they would still move like children because their bodies are different. I kept forgetting how young they were and in my mind I actually imagined them as teenagers.<br /><br />Another thing I didn't like was the subplot lines of Ender's siblings. It doesn't show up until about half-way through the book and is vague and under explained. Many things in the book felt a bit contrived.<br /><br />The writing itself wasn't super impressive, but the story idea and the concept was fantastic. Overall, I really enjoyed this book and feel that it would be interesting to most readers.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I thought this was a good book...although I was a little disappointed by the end of the series in general.  It kept with the story line and had suspense and everything you want in a good read.
0374214913|3.0|I won't tell you what the story is about since that's already been done.  Suffice to say, I enjoyed it.  The pace was swift, the characters weren't shallow, and the main character's voice was entertaining.  His asides made me laugh and he was spot on about internet life, e-readers, and the bubble it's all really in.  I was very into the idea of a secret society of obsessed readers pouring over books to find certain things.  I liked riding alongside them.  I wouldn't mind being in that society actually!  I also enjoyed the relationships between the characters and the background story of how Clay (main character) and his best friend met and their continued invoking of certain \\"names\\" to cement the importance of favors.  You'll see what I mean.  :)<br /><br />I gave this only 3 stars for a couple reasons.  First is that's far too in love with Google.  The author presents Google as some sort of Utopia that the entire planet should be based on.  It was like one continuous product placement.  The author invented fictional places in this book, perhaps he should have done the same for Google.<br /><br />Second, the ending.  It was simplistic and trite.  Not sure what I was expecting.  Like the main character I wasn't expecting any great answer to life's mysteries, but still... It was rather like an ending for toddlers who are just starting out to learn morals and what's important in life.  Nothing earth-shattering.<br /><br />This book is 304 pages.  I read it in about 5 hours.  Definitely not a waste of time if you enjoy sitting back, smiling a bit and having an entertaining ride without expecting anything too deep.
B008B0QH5S|4.0|This new album is very mellow but I really like it, his voice hasn't changed a bit! I would recommend it to anyone that is a Petshop Boys fan!
B00979OL5A|1.0|Bought the free version and my Grandson has been playing it for a month.  He loves the game and suddenly it's not compatable to the Kindle Fire any more.  So annoying seeing I've bought him several coin packages to use with it.  So stupid that it's suddenly not compatable my grandson is Heartbroken.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Amazon has done a great job on these.  They are solid, well constructed, and stylish.<br />There are two \\"minor\\" cons.<br />1. The amazon logos everywhere are a bit much.  Nothing a sharpie did not fix.<br />2. The velcro setup on different areas is a bit cheesy, but this is how its done on Camera bags that are 5-times or greater priced.  Its a great bag.  Get one.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This series got a lot of bad press ... but a lot of press is still good press they say, if you get past the snickers and giggles about the sex story line .. and go to the plot of the story, you will love it too.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This is a simple easy game that I like to play as a stress reducer exercise. Not much challenge but still fun to play.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|It was fun but once you ran out of coins intakes a wile for more to come. I liked that the prides are cool.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|When i wanted something to read i opened up my Oxford American dictionary and I knew that it would help me in the future. A sincere thank you
B00843TZJM|5.0|I have always been a fan of CSN,CSNY and Buffalo Springfield. What surprised me on this DVD was the performance by Steven Stills. After reading some negative reviews about Steven Stills' vocals on this DVD, I was expecting to hear an old rocker who had lost it.  Some of the reviews almost prevented me from my purchase. I purchased the Blu-ray version. Steven Stills rewarded me with his gravelly vocals and guitar playing while David Crosby and Graham Nash were also excellent. Crosby's vocals were melting and Nash's musical gift is the same as 20 years ago. This DVD will make you smile.  Sit back and have a cocktail and turn the volume up a little bit and enjoy. Now I will wait for the CSNY concert.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Well I was waiting to get the last book for free and my daughter unknowingly ordered it.  I read it in a day.  Once again I could not put it down, but not necessarily for the same reasons. I agree with previous reviewws that although I wasn't expecting utopia, I would have thought there would have been more happiness and fire in the end with her choice.  The guy deserved it.  I'm not sure Ms. Collins was aware of how much her readers loved the her final choice (trying not to spoil here).  I had something in common with the Capital people in watching her romances bloom.  I was disappoiinted that the voted in favor of something towards the ends as you would have thought enough blood had been shed.  Don't get too attached to anyone in this book that's for sure.
B009O1YRN2|4.0|How to Tell If Your Cat Is Plotting to Kill You is a 2012 collection of cat-themed comics by Matthew Inman from his website, The Oatmeal. It features a large number of comics from the site, plus a few new ones.<br /><br />At their best, Inman's comics are offbeat, manic, vulgar, and over the top, and under any circumstances, they aren't for the easily offended. On the whole, the comics collected here are quite enjoyable, if perhaps not quite up to the level of funniness Inman has generated in the past. Several comics are little more than whimsically put-together observations of cat behavior. There are a couple of classics here, though, including \\"How to Pet a Kitty\\" and \\"Cat VS Internet.\\"<br /><br />The book itself is high quality, with thick, glossy pages, and most of the comics are in color.<br />This is a decent-sized book - 130 pages - but it's an extremely quick read, as many of the pages only feature one panel each. Half the book (literally) is comprised of \\"The Bobcats\\" and \\"Cat VS Internet\\" - this latter has been stretched out to 21 pages. Obviously, Inman has to adapt his comics to the dimensions of the printed page, but caveat emptor.<br /><br />Cat-loving Oatmeal fans should get plenty of mileage out of this book; fans of only one or the other may get substantially less.
B00338QENI|5.0|This work just touched on so many areas: race relations, history, relationships, ethics, civil duty, medical research, determination, justice... I could just go on and on. The writer did a thorough investigation and though she became personally involved with her subject matter, I think that made it a better work, not a worse one. Skloot brought a passion to the pursuit of truth of a simple woman who, without knowing it, allowed the world we live in to come to be. Highly recommended to those who appreciate the complexities of truth in its darkest and lightest moments.<br /><br />Listened to the Audiobook. I also give high praise to the readers. It was a difficult task: to bring authenticity to characters from diverse socio-eceonomic and cultural backgrounds and not to sound condescending or overreaching. She was superb.
B008O9V4C2|4.0|This album is all killer no filler, but the two best songs are such standouts that they overshadow the rest of an otherwise highly enjoyable album.<br /><br />Weather in My Head features some amazing guitar work. I'm Not the Same Without You features the best lyrics I've heard from anybody in a while. This is a serious contender for my new favorite song.<br /><br />I do agree with another reviewer, though; a more combustible drummer would have elevated this album from great to all-universe. I love Steve Gadd's work on Aja and I think that level of drumming has been the missing ingredient from some of their more recent efforts.<br /><br />The album is an easy recommendation for a blind buy.  That said, if you want to try-before-you-bey, I'm Not The Same Without You is up on YouTube.  Check it out!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I really enjoyed \\"Reflected in You\\" and the major twist with Gideon showing the ultimate sacrifice by literally eliminating the person that took away Eva's innocence, and getting away with murder.  I didn't see that coming! The book is very sexy and romantic.  I look forward to finding out more about Gideon's past in the third book and hopefully the two of them can finally heal together as abuse survivors.  I plan to re-read again!
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I got this book because it was on sale for even cheaper than it already was. After the first novella, I was hooked. Set in a dystopian future (which almost always a win for me anyway), people are cramped in silo, living their life underground, unless they want to go out. Of course, they're in a silo for a reason. The outside isn't so nice. I was wondering how this idea could hold for 5 novellas at first, but it held very well.<br /><br />The only complaint I have is that the 5th in the series dragged on a bit too long. I wouldn't say chapters were useless, but sometimes they felt a bit too long in contrast to the rest of the series. Other than that though, it was great, and I'm excitedly waiting for the next Silo story!
B00526ZKYS|3.0|Overall, I thought that DELIRIUM was...pretty good.<br /><br />WHAT I LIKED:<br />1. The Writing--Lauren Oliver's writing style is amazing. The story has a great flow and the setting & characters are described in very vivid detail without dragging down the story. And I felt like I could be right there with the characters.<br />2. The Plot--***MINOR SPOILER ALERT***A lot of times when a dystopian character rebels against their dystopian government, like in UGLIES or MATCHED, it feels weird or forced. I didn't get as much of a feeling of that in DELIRIUM. There were times when I considered stopping but Oliver's prose kept me hooked. So I kept on reading. And I'm so glad that I did. If Lena had gone through with her cure I probably wouldn't have kept reading through the second book because then it would have turned out like in UGLIES. I liked what happened in DELIRIUM much better.<br />3. The Characters--I really liked the characters in DELIRIUM. Hana in particular was my favorite. She was a good yang to Lena's yin. I also reallly liked Grace. She was thought to be mute, yet she plays such a powerful role in the plot. For the most part and with few exceptions I thought that the characters were deep and well thought out.<br /><br />WHAT I DIDN'T LIKE:<br />1. The Plot--Like I said, there were times I considered stopping. And I actually did pause reading it for a little while. It was just a few issues, which I will explain later. But I decided to keep going. (The reason I put this in the DISLIKE section was because what I didn't like was I guess part of the plot.)<br />2. LENA + ALEX--This was my main issue with the book and the reason I gave it only three stars--Lena and Alex's reationship. I just couldn't get into it at first. Upon reading it a second time I enjoyed it a little more. I just didn't really connect with Alex as a character. He was just too predictable. Of COURSE Lena was going to fall for him and of COURSE he was a you-know-what. I'd guessed it from the beginning. I mean, I could understand where the attraction came from, but in terms of relationships it's not up there for me with Katniss and Peeta. Just sayin.<br /><br />OVERALL:<br />I enjoyed DELIRIUM. I have in fact read through PANDEMONIUM and HANA and am not disappointed. Fyi, for me 3 stars means the book was good but not really great, I would probably read it again, and I would recommend it to dystopia science fiction fans who liked THE HUNGER GAMES and DIVERGENT. And my comments shouldn't discourage you from reading it, it is a very good book, my dislikes are simply personal.eginning.

B0079XPUOW|1.0|I am thoroughly perturbed. I could not/would not even finish this book when I got to the part where the author was asking us readers to provide him with information due to writer's block. I truly enjoyed and gave good reviews for Old Man's War, Ghost Brigade and such, but no more. I will not even buy another book by this guy without a mass Kindle apology.<br /><br />This is the first time in years that I made it 75% through a book and got so insulted that I put it down.<br /><br />One of two things has occurred: (1) As the writer says himself he has gone \\"bugshit crazy\\" and has had a mental meltdown, OR (2) He is craftier and lazier that we thought and is getting us poor unsuspecting (and paying) patrons to send him possible plot outlines. Either option sux.<br /><br />Don't get this one unless you are related to him or have no expectations. Moreover, don't do his work for him, that is what we PAY the author for, not the other way around. I have a great couple of sci-fi books that I could send him, but HE would have to pay ME. You did not read him offering you that did you? From an long-time Heinlein-Weber-Drake MIL-Sci-Fan, former English professor, divorce lawyer, wordsmith, and linguist: Run Forrest Run!<br />Cheers,<br />Seth
B008VKNEJU|3.0|Hints of greatness. Favorite songs are devotion, running and sweet talk. You should check out the remixes to running too.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I've been married over 30 years and during that time I didn't know my wife's love language and she didn't know mine. Why did we wait so long to read this book? Since reading it, and talking about it - my love meter hovers between 3/4 and full tank. When I read the chapter describing my main love language, I started crying because I felt exactly like the people described in that chapter. My wife said she also cried when she read the chapter pertaining to her love language. We highly recommend this to others. Don't wait 30+ years into your marriage to read it, but if you do, it's still not too late.
B000QRIGLC|4.0|Well worth the money.  His experiences kept me interested from start to finish.  Likely one of the better books in this catagory.
B008GOAFBQ|4.0|First of all...this is the best remix/remastering of a classic KISS album so far.<br />It sounds phenomenal!!!<br />But of course there are a at least a couple of flaws.....One being the skip on the intro to \\"Flaming Youth\\"...which has been addressed in other reviews.<br />If you don't notice it, you're not a true fan.....<br />My biggest gripe is the \\"added\\" or repeated background vocals on \\"Detroit Rock City\\"...I feel they ruin the song.<br />Too bad, because besides that, this is a great release.....should have left the song alone.

It comes across, to me, as \\"Preachy\\". As an introvert myself, I can't stand that, I just want to get away from it. I didn't mind when trained authorities were cited, (were they cited?), but this author tells me what I \\"should\\" do, and I don't see her as an authority.

B007THA4FI|1.0|This book is the biggest disappointment! JK Rowling has prooven that she can write characters that we love and that we love to hate in the HP series, but you don't see any of that in The Casual Vacancy. Either the characters are not worth mentioning or just disguising because of their behavior and disregard for others. What a waste of time, money and energy. JK Rowling should stick to what she knows.

B000NI8F5G|5.0|Singin' In The Rain is one of many movies from that era that I really enjoy. It's a comedy with an underlying love story. It's fun not only in the sense of the story line, but also in giving a very brief idea of the difficulties faced in going from silent movies to \\"Talkies.\\"<br /><br />Gene Kelly as Don is fantastic, as he is in any role. The dynamic between the characters Don (Gene Kelly), Cosmo (Donald O' Connor), and Kathy (Debbie Reynolds) is fun and creative. Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen) is the perfect villain, and does a great job being in a role of someone you love to hate.<br /><br />It is very cute, old school humor that enchants children as well. I watched this again recently via Amazon.com's online rental program so that my 10 yr old daughter could view it with me. She giggled and laughed her way through it, particularly enjoying the scenes, \\"Make them laugh\\" and \\"Moses supposes.\\"<br /><br />The only difficulty I encountered in watching this show was that the volume was poor. I had my computer turned to top volume, and had it sitting only 2 feet away from us, and we were straining to hear parts of the conversations. I'm not sure if that's an Amazon issue or just how old the movie is. Usually volume is not an issue when I use the computer to watch a movie, and hasn't been since. However, this is the first instantly watchable movie I've viewed on Amazon, so I can't say if it is a website problem, or the age of the movie, that caused this difficulty.<br /><br />I highly recommend this show for all ages. It's clean and fun enough for the younger crowd and thoroughly enjoyable in all aspects for the older crowd.
B007THA4FI|3.0|J.K. Rowling's style is great.  Her character development is excellent.  It's really too bad that I can't say the same for the story.  Even though everything was tied up in a neat little package at the end, I was still left with a feeling of disappointment.  About all I got from the book is that everyone has secrets and nobody is really happy.  I read books that move me or entertain me more than once.  Once was enough for Casual Vacancy.

B005LLSLPE|5.0|This is a great show - keeps you guessing with each episode - one of my favorite shows! I missed some episodes on t.v. - and long wait for Season 4 episode 1 and episode 4 on Netflix - while season 5 is already on t.v. - so was glad that Amazon had these episodes available so I can get caught up.  Only thing is if you missed several episodes at $1.99 an episode it  can quickly add up almost the cost of buying the whole season - but Amazon does have available for free the very first season. If you start watching this show you'll be hooked and addicted to it!

B008C20TDG|4.0|Great tool for simplifying the paleo diet! I am a big fan of this lifestyle shift but I had come from a background of measuring my food and eating the same things for days on end. This book helped me get a grasp on eating by sight alone, and getting more nutrients by switching up the veggies. Easy to read and good for a quick reference.

0679735909|5.0|I love this book.  I have re-read it often.  THIS IS A GENUINE WORK OF ART.  The real deal.  This may be the best book written in English, in the last fifty years?<br />Sixty?  When much of the dross of the publishing industry is long forgotten in a hundred years or so, I believe readers will still be turning the pages of Possession.<br /><br />A great, artistic imagination created this multi-layered, multi-textured, multi<br />character story. The plot is strong, with an element of who-dunit. The characters are engaging and likable (some of them), there is a villain, sort of, who gets his comeuppance. Kind of.<br /><br />Roland and Maud - I don't want to spoil your fun, but they both change, in believable ways. The events in the book change them, they grow, and Byatt captures it in exquisite prose.<br /><br />Such a human book.  Written with such care, such love, such a sure hand, such craft, that goes beyond craft, to reach a 'Work of Art'.  Sublime.
B000QFW7UA|4.0|The product itself is fantastic. Unfortunately I paid for it to be gift wrapped and all they did was throw the note in the box. Otherwise it would have gotten 5 stars.

140053271X|3.0|The reader is great except you cant use it until you register it. Went to the library and couldnt get on their wifi to do it. Nor could I use macdonalds where they have the at&t hotspot they promised would work. The nook wouldnt let me do it anywhere but a Barnes and Nobles store so I didnt get to use it for almost 2 weeks. Then I made my first purchase of an ebook...1 book...and they double charged me. once through barnesandnoble.com and again through barnesandnoble/marketplace. They appoligized but wouldnt be putting the money back for 5 days. Since this was cash money they took off my debit card I was just out for days...wonder what would have happened if Id bought 10 books? The nook seems to work great now that I can use it, but using barnes and noble for you ebooks might not be the best idea. They admitted they were having a problem with the double dipping and were trying to fix it. I had it happen 2 years ago when I ordered on line to have paper backs sent to me. So it hasnt been fixed in 2 years:( But I like the nook!
B002OSY2T6|5.0|My son didn't like tummy time very much, but this toy got him more interested in it.  Now he loves tummy time (6 mos old), and this is one of his favorite toys.  He loves to look in the mirror, and it encourages his movement because he bats it away from himself, so he has to go get it.  He began rolling a lot in order to get closer to this toy.  He likes to pick it up and chew on the snail's antennae, too.  This is one of the best toy purchases I've made, and I would recommend it to any parent struggling with tummy time in their newborn or infant.
B009KHDT0C|3.0|Tim Burton's \\"Dark Shadow's\\" was, at best an occasionally funny tribute to a cult television show. I was a fan of the original, and I have been a huge fan of Burton,Depp & Bonham Carter. However this was a mediocre attemp from all three.

0525952926|5.0|Winter of the World picks right up where the Fall of Giants ended. You meet the next generations of the families you followed in Giants and are taken up to and through World War11. I loved the interactions between the families and the continuing journey observing how the lives of the family continue to intertwine. Great read! Can't wait for the third book of the trilogy!!
B004J4WKTW|4.0|The Night Circus was a buffet for the senses.  There was a dark side which was represented by the abuse and neglect in the parenting of Marco and Celia however this was overshadowed by the wondrous and beautiful imagery of the individual tents represented in the circus.  It was not an easy read but rather a read that encouraged you to continue reading and at the same time challenged you to remember the characteristics of the many characters and make sense of the timeline.
B007TK77QE|4.0|I enjoyed reading The Casual Vacancy very much.I thought it was very well written and the descriptions of the characters were very believable.I did,however,think one character may have been based on Uncle Vernon from the Harry Potter series.The plot kept me interested throughout the book and although the ending wasn't totally unexpected I did find it extremely sad.I hope Ms Rowling continues to write books for adults as she seems to be totally in touch with the real world, which is quite unbelievable considering the fantasy world we have come to know through her previous books.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Imagine you discover that your wife is missing and then clues emerge that point to you as the killer.  What is going on?  This is the premise of \\"Gone Girl,\\" an entertaining book that puts you inside the head of the husband (and wife eventually) as you try to unravel the mystery.  The points of view shift in the novel between the husband and wife's perspective, throwing plenty of plot twists in your path and swinging your sympathies back and forth.  I enjoyed reading this but it also seemed rather contrived.  For example, Desi - a character who appears later in the book - seemed completely unrealistic to me and mostly functions as a plot device (you'll see if you read the book).<br /><br />So, an entertaining read but not without some bumps.

1451627297|4.0|This is a long book. This is a wordy book. This book, although about 600 pages in I was wondering, is a very good book. The last chapter, no don't cheat you won't get it, and the afterword alone are worth the price of admission.
B008U7ZPHS|5.0|Rick Riordan's greek gods series that started with Percy Jackson and the Lightning Thief, continues here in its 8 chapter, Mark of Athena.<br /><br />Mark of Athena brings the 7 strongest demigods of the age together, for the start of their quest to stop the awakening of Gaia, and keep her Giants from destroying the world. With an interesting story, a few jokes, and a couple of battles, and the best ending of a book in this series so far, I recommend this book to anyone who still has an inner child. Though this book is probably best received by young teens, as it has fairly young protagonists, I myself am much older than this, and still find this kind of book enjoyable.<br /><br />The only bad thing about Mark of Athena is that I have to wait so long for the next chapter.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This is a great book. It was good as an audio book and as a digital book. Very suspenseful and well-written.

B008KOMMTA|1.0|THIS REVIEW AND RATING IS FOR THE BLU-RAY BOX SET PACKAGING--NOT THE MOVIE!  THE MOVIE DESERVES FIVE STARS.<br />I recently bought two Titanic Blu-ray box sets.  Both sets arrived with the cheaply made cardboard inserts mangled.  This set was evidently created by someone who had no experience in manufacturing design.  The book, blu-ray disc, and supplementary materials shifted around during shipping and damaged the interior of the box set.  $109.00 plus shipping is a lot of money to spend for an item that is poorly created.  Paramount should look at what Warner Brothers and Twentieth Century Fox have produced over the past few years.  \\"The Wizard of Oz\\", \\"Gone With the Wind\\", and \\"The Sound of Music\\" were superior box sets compared to this flimsy produced product.  One of the Titanic box sets also had missing supplementary materials. (Titanic passenger dossier as listed on the back of the box.)  At least Amazon provided a prompt refund, but I had to package the product up, and take it to a UPS shipper.<br /><br />Amazon produced this set in a very small production run.  The online price varies from day to day--from just over $100 to $300 or more.  Believe me, this box set is not worth more than fifty dollars!!!  Stay with the standard blu-ray disc only edition.  You will avoid many problems!!!
B008K5T5AI|5.0|Great Read - Have read all in series.  very innovative Sci-Fi.<br /><br />I pre-ordered this as I knew it would be great.<br /><br />This is a book in the Culture Series, where the culture is a pan-galactic loose assiciation of humanoid species, which has evolved its Artificial Intelligences into its greatest minds. These \\"Minds\\" typically run their society but always with large input from the humans themselves.  The Minds view the biological \\"human\\" part of the culture as essential to inject some chaos into the thinking of the society as a whole.<br /><br />Key story in the Hydrogen Sonata is where another species, associated with but not a part of the Culture, decides to forsake physical existance and \\"Sublime\\" into a energy/hyperspace existence.  The story takes place in the months leading up to that event.<br /><br />Iain Banks is a great author both in SciFi Genre and in contemporary fiction.<br /><br />Note: This is not a book for children or those easily offended by occasional fairly graphic sexual references.  Those references are part of the story and not a key element.

B008RTE09S|5.0|A very zany Beatles film, but it truly is an awesome creation. The Beatles walk us through their psychedelic dreams. The first song Fool on the Hill, will always be my favorite.The smokey and eerie Blue Jay Way by George Harrison. What I love about this film it is so unconventional from all other films. This 2012 Blu- Ray version of Magical Mystery Tour is fantastic. This edition is loaded with special features, with commentary from Paul McCartney. The Picture is fantastic and if you are a Beatles fan, you will love this film.

Lots of other peole have written long explanations to why the book is boring, badly written and not worth spending any money or time on. I AGREE with all of them.
B008IYOEZM|5.0|Since we no longer have cable or satellite TV service, we use Amazon Prime, Netflix and Hulu for our viewing entertainment, and we are die-hard Dexter fans, I finally got around to purchasing and viewing Dexter Season 6. Holy cow! What a cliff hanger ending! This was a very different (good) role for the typically comedic Colin Hanks (Tom Hanks' son.) Not sure I like the direction of the cliff hanger emotional event reveal for this season; however, I can't wait until Season 7 is available to purchase so I can find out what happens next!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book is awesome! I loved it! I cant wait until the next book comes out. Fantastic read! Adults only!!!!!
B005OT2YVA|1.0|2 big complaints:<br /><br />1.  great start with the archive video of the moon race, including references to NASA, Sputnik, and the Soviet moon probes.  No story to follow.<br /><br />2.  Dumb girl, \\"eek!\\"  Really beautiful, but never physically confronts these huge machines.  Hey, the guys are just as unmatched as she.  She is shown at the start at resourceful & smart.  Give her something!  Her only power was in gossiping to the bad bots to play mind games.<br /><br />One small complaint:<br /><br />The little boy in me would love to see the transformers build into some mega bot, like Power Rangers do, or to use some junk around them to add to their arsenal.
B006LSZECO|5.0|In the beginning I was wondering what all of the hype was about but then as you really get into the book, it's like \\"holy cow\\" this is such a great read.  Very fun, the twists and turns.

This movie reminded me of the classic children's movies from my past and the warm feelings associated with them, something that I rarely find in most modern movies.
B008RTE08E|3.0|I am a huge fan of The Fabs and this film. Its my favorite among the five films simply because it stands out as the unique one among the lot and it also ushers in my favorite period of the band. With that said having read reviews by others I am suprised to find that no one touched upon the look of the restoration.<br /><br />I have purchased this film in numerous formats over the years beginning with the 1988 vhs official mpi copy that was superb by the way, the 1997 first official dvd mpi and now the restored dvd. Regarding this new dvd I have to say I am a bit disappointed with the restoration. The picture does look beautiful as others have pointed out but the one issue that I have to address is the long shots ... they are out of focus and a bit blury where as The close ups are perfection.<br /><br />Am I the only one that has noticed this? At first I thought ok its a made for tv movie from 1967 and it was shot by The Beatles by the seat of their pants and maybe the long shots were always out of focus? Well I slipped on my 1997 mpi dvd copy and found that the long shots were just as clear as the close-ups! So as the title of my review states it's a mystery to me. All of the people who worked on the restoration and no one noticed this? With that said and off my chest I welcome the opinions of others on this issue to see if Im not the only fool on the hill that noticed.<br /><br />I will say that regardless of the imperfection its still worth the purchase of this reissue for the extras alone. They make it all worth it and a splendid time is still guaranteed for all
B000SEGUDE|5.0|Just a short note to say that this book is nothing short of amazing. Wonderful writing - a new style for each character and story. Mysterious connections between the stories.<br />But, you feel that you are in a master's sure hands throughout the journey.

0525952616|5.0|I'm a fan of Daniel Suarez's novels, as I like how he can take advanced technology and push it to the edge to create a nightmare scenario.  In Kill Decision, Suarez takes the topic of unmanned aerial drones, combines them with software to make autonomous decisions, and you get a form of warfare that has few defenses.  Even worse, you have some powerful vested interests who want to make sure that the public has the correct \\"opinion\\" of these drones.  Suarez paints a picture that is both scary and not all that implausible in the next few years.<br /><br />The story centers around a black ops military group that is sent in under cover to take care of less-than-legal situations.  They rescue a researcher from her compound in Africa before a drone strike destroys the area.  Her study of insect hive behavior has apparently been used in drone programming to allow a large number of small autonomous drones to attack an area and make decisions based on the conditions they face.  It's a good bet that foreign governments are making these cheap weapons and planning a strike that will render regular military defense impotent against mass drone swarms.  It may also be possible that elements in our own government are willing to incur some damage to sway public opinion in a direction that would allow more domestic use of drones to \\"protect\\" us.  Even though the black ops group has been told to stand down in their mission to find and destroy the drones, they aren't convinced that their orders are coming from the people who *should* be concerned about what's happening.  They have to find answers quickly before the very thing they're trying to destroy ends up destroying them.<br /><br />This novel, like the others that Suarez wrote, was easy to get into, and I was in a \\"don't want to stop reading\\" mode within a chapter or two.  In my mind, the characters took a bit of a back seat to the technology of drone warfare, both for where it is right now, and for what it could easily become.  While it might be easy to brush off some of the drone possibilities as fantasy, I didn't see it that way.  That whole topic is shrouded in secrecy, and it's not a huge leap from unmanned drones to drones making decisions on their own.  Couple cheap single-purpose drones with insect-like behavior algorithms, and the possibilities become rather scary.  It's certain that \\"mass\\" and \\"cheap\\" have already been mastered...<br /><br />I really liked Kill Decision.  Certain parts of the story (such as groups that have seemingly unlimited resources to run deception operations) might be pushing the edges of credibility, but the way the story weaves around how unmanned drones can (and will) obliterate traditional warfare strategy makes up for it.<br /><br />Disclosure:<br />Obtained From: Publisher<br />Payment: Freehile it might be easy to brush off some of the drone possibilities as fantasy, I didn't see it that way.

B007712XAU|5.0|Who wouldn't enjoy watching Downton Abbey? Who doesn't love Maggie Smith?<br />Downton Abbey is a wonderful PBS series you can watch with your boyfriend, your daughter, your cat, or alone with equal pleasure.<br />If you are having one of those days and need a break, a little time for Number One (you!) treat yourself to this series and watch an episode or two. Downton Abbey feels authentic, right down to the detail on the actor's costumes. Downton Abbey is captivating, engrossing and fun to watch.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|This book just like the 2 previous books was fair.  The complete story is pretty cool and also pretty \\"steamy\\" but this book has alot of the same sophmoric writing.  Way too much repeating of each other's names and the inner goddess. I was already tired of hearing Ms. Steele and Mr. Gray by midway through the first book and was really sick of it by the third one.  I am 41 years old and read alot. I don't think the author realized how all of the repeating of certain phrases over and over and over would sound to an older audience.  If I was in my 20's I might not have noticed it as much.  Overall I would say the book is an o.k. read if you can get past certain redundant parts the plot itself is rather interesting and has a good ending.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|It was great to have the complete saga.  I was disappointed, however, in all of the changes that were made to the original 3.  There is a sense of nastalgia in watching Star Wars and to see scenes adjusted and \\"updated\\" was disappointing.  I would have rather had the original theatrical versions even though they may not have been as advanced in technology.

B0051BNRTO|5.0|I must admit I got the audio book first, as a present, but that was the luckiest coincidence. The three speakers really achoieve to bring the book to life. They could not have been chosen more carefully. When you get to the part where Tucker appears, the fun and story seriously begins to unfold.<br />But apart from that, this book has been my companion through thick and thin, and, to me, the characters in this book are deeper and more interesting than in his other novels.<br />I especially love that it is not only funny, but a tragicomedy. This makes the story both serious and loveable.<br />It's not (only) the plot that is interesting but the depths of its characters, too.

When done wrong it can be disastrous, but when done RIGHT, a masterpiece is born.<br />And Looper gets everything right.<br /><br />Looper is influenced by Time-Travel classics such as [[ASIN:B000ICXQF6 12 Monkeys]], and [[ASIN:B00005N5S5 The Terminator]], yet is extremely original.<br /><br />Blending stylish, visceral action, with sharp, thought-provoking storytelling, stunning scope and cinematography, memorable characters, stellar acting, pulse-pounding twists, moments of unexpected humour, and a truly moving finale, Looper asks big questions, engages our hearts and our heads, and pulls no punches.<br /><br />Rising star Joseph Gordon-Levitt leads the film, exuding an intense charisma, definitely holding his own against the older Willis. Bruce Willis, whose 57 years have not diminished his ability to kick ass, is more than awesome as the morally tortured old version of Levitt's character. Emily Blunt rounds out the main cast, with Paul Dano, Jeff Daniels, and Noah Segan absolutely stealing the scenes in their respective roles.<br /><br />The look of the film is impressive. Johnson and cinematographer Steve Yedlin have crafted the most gritty-realistic and believable future world since Children of Men. Johnson has found the perfect mix of believable physics, and entertaining sci-fi (hover bikes, blunderbusses, and telekinesis). And Nathan Johnson's (Rian's cousin) score suits the film beautifully.<br /><br />The story is totally original, equalling if not surpassing that of films such as Inception and Source Code. The plot is on the surface simple, but as one digs deeper, they find that Looper is a multi-layered, deep, thought-provoking film. Rian Johnson poses a lot of hard questions to the audience, and as the film progresses, it really makes you think. It's truly one of the best written films of the last 10 years.<br /><br />But don't  worry, there's  plenty of  action all the  way  through  to keep  you  absolutely riveted  to your seat. Utterly spectacular, brutal, electrifying, roaring, crashing, wicked, thrilling action!<br /><br />So, in recap:  Looper has a stellar cast, sensational cinematography, a thought-provoking script to die for, and pulse-pounding action. It's both the best sci-fi and the action film of the year. Ranking with Moon, Minority Report, Children of Men, and Inception, Looper is one of the greatest science fiction films of the 21st Century.<br /><br />A 5 star triumph!ough  to keep  you  absolutely riveted  to your seat. Utterly spectacular, brutal, electrifying, roaring, crashing, wicked, thrilling action!<br /><br />So, in recap:  Looper has a stellar cast, sensational cinematography, a thought-provoking script to die for, and pulse-pounding action. It's both the best sci-fi and the action film of the year.

B004LWZW4W|5.0|Rise of the Planet of the Apes is one of the greatest, most exciting, and action packed sci-fi films of the last 10 years.<br /><br />It's refreshingly original and popcorn-worthy, and its effects are absolutely beautiful, and it has an emotional core that sets it apart from your average action film.<br /><br />Andy Serkis shines as Caesar, a super-smart chimpanzee harboring resentment towards humans, while James Franco charms as the human protagonist Will Rodman. The rest of the cast is sensational, too.<br />The action will have you riveted to your seat, and the climax on Golden Gate Bridge is one of the finest since The Matrix.<br /><br />It's like this movie was tailor-made to my tastes. I can't wait for the sequel!
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I have this downloaded on my Kindle Fire and on nh smartphone. it is one of my favorites!!! its really easy to use. you can make lists and documents....I enjoy making little notes and using it as a diary.  great app!!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I enjoyed Book Two more than I did Book One. I'm now reading Book Three.<br />I'm a Sr. Citizen so the imaginative 'kinky' sex, at this stage of life, is not what holds me to the book.I am enjoying the two main characters as I like to see their relationship evolve.It is fulfilling to read how Ana can understand and feel compassion for Christain's<br />darkness and grows to trust his love for her. Also how she lays the groundwork so that, given his trauma, he gains her trust. It is refreshing that she is not using him for his billions and that she even has a hard time understanding how one lives with that kind of bank account.. It feels right that he 'gets' her and instinctively knows he can be safe with her. Their emotional bond is so special and probably the kind of love that many people wish for with a mate. Clearly this kind of emotonal bond and the ensuing depth of love works slowly to evaporate his strong impulse for the S & M erotica he had needed in the past. For my taste, the writer seems to embrace this couple in all the delicacy and complexity of their relationship. She understands the nuances of what makes this couple click and presents it well to the reader. Hoping a movie is in the works!
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|really fun jewel like game, only complaint is that its short.  great time killer no regrets.  wish it was longer.
0307361012|3.0|Like most fans of Nesbo's addictive Harry Hole series, I was looking forward to reading this long-delayed English language translation of the first HH novel. Even though the main character is Norwegian, this story takes place in Australia. Sort of a weird touch, but actually the \\"foreign\\" setting is one of the strengths to this story. All in all, this is not a bad read, but many elements aren't up to par with the later novels in Nesbo's series. For example, the dialogue isn't as sharp, the characters are a mixed bag as far as believability (the Aboriginal characters are well done, whereas the other police officers come off mostly as buffoons), and the plot loses some focus along the way. At one point --- or two --- I thought the story was about to come to its climax, but then it went on and on again. All in all, this one lacked the suspense and tension of the other novels and just didn't grip me as much. By no means awful, but clearly the work of a writer that hadn't quite found his groove yet. Most fans of the series will find some enjoyable elements to this story, but if you haven't read the others in the series I don't think you should necessarily start with this one simply because it was the first one.
B008G12ERC|5.0|When I first heard snippets of the album here on Amazon, I wasn't sure if I would even buy the album.  I am a huge fan of Muse and I have heard all of their music from Showbiz to the Resistance, but when I heard this I wasn't even sure if I liked it.  It was so different and I am not a huge fan of pop music (there are a few songs on here that are more \\"pop\\" than previous albums).  But then I went to YouTube to listen to some of these new songs before I bought the album, and I loved them.  Yes it's different -- different styles (pop, dubstep etc.) -- but Muse does them well.  There is emotion and meaning to their music no matter what style they seem to try.  Of course, there is still the rock that you are used to from Muse (Supremacy comes to mind)but I give five stars to Muse for even daring to try new things with there music instead of doing the same stuff over and over.  Not every musician can be so flexible with their musical style and do it well.<br /><br />Now on the topic of Chris singing.  Some people don't like the fact that he sang in this album and that he should have made his own album for them.  I'm not sure if I agree or not, but I do know that I really enjoy his voice and I think his two songs are decent songs. I'm glad they were put out there.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is like so awesome because I get to play a lot with out buying each game great app ive gave it 5 stars and I said my reason
0316228532|2.0|I did read the book.  But to be honest, it was so pathetic that toward the end, I was skimming just to be done with it.  It deserved one star, but I gave it two for creativity.  Much of the atmosphere is crude and lowlife.  Many of the love scenes are brutish and animalistic.  If you like that kind of stuff, go for it.  But get real, J.K., this is not your genre.  Stick with Harry Potter fantasy. You deserve those 5 star accolades.

B007FEFLTO|4.0|A strong history of a very turbulent time in the world.  Good tight writing strong characters, de4als with the European problems and not with asia.
0061353248|5.0|The book was a great easy read. I think the goal was to provide the reader with tests that justify the self descriptive chapter headings. From my perspective the author wasn't trying to write it out like a research paper. There are chapters that justify behavior (through experiment) that may be already known and there others that shed light on behavior that's pretty interesting. Chapter 12 for example.  All in all good read

B008G8SFGO|5.0|I've been a huge KISS fan for quite a few years now, so it should come as no surprise to anyone that I've been eagerly waiting for the release of Monster.  After the release of \\"Sonic Boom\\" (which I waited over a decade for) and the highly successful world tour in support of it, KISS announced that they would be releasing their next album some time in late 2011 (November if memory serves me correctly).  When I heard this news, I became ecstatic.<br /><br />KISS would leak tidbits of information about the writing and recording process (which baited fans even more) but as November drew near, the band became somewhat quiet.  Soon enough, they announced that there new album wouldn't hit shelves until February of 2012.  \\"Okay,\\" I thought, \\"it's just a few more months.\\"  As February drew closer, however, KISS announced the date would be \\"sometime in the spring.\\"  I became discouraged and even a tad angry.  I wanted something new from the band.<br /><br />Finally, KISS announced the release date of October 9 here in the good ol' U.S. of A.  They released the first single, \\"Hell Or Hallelujah\\" in July and the media onslaught began.  Just a few months before the release of the single, KISS released info on their Monster book and also leaked out pictures for what would eventually be known as the album's photoshoot.  They also toured with Motley Crue (which I took in at The Woodlands, TX).<br /><br />Finally, October 9 arrived and I picked up my copy of the album.  I can honestly say that it is the first album from KISS that immediately grabbed me.  Despite being a loyal soldier in the KISS Army, it has always taken me at least a few months (or in the case of \\"Music From The Elder,\\" years) to warm up to each KISS album.  Monster chewed me up and spit me out from the first time I heard \\"Hell Or Hallelujah.\\"<br /><br />The lead single opens the album with an assault on the ears.  It beats the listener down and sets them up for the pounding \\"Wall Of Sound.\\"  The track (as well as the entire album) is string heavy, and Gene Simmons' thudding and plodding bass hits you hard.  Following \\"Wall Of Sound\\" is the Paul Stanley fronted \\"Freak.\\"  It's one of my favorite tunes on the album, an anthemic track for weirdos and outsiders like myself.<br /><br />\\"Back To The Stone Age\\" finds Gene on the mic once again and Eric Singer's pounding drums really drive this tune.  It's quickly followed up by \\"Long Way Down\\" and \\"Shout Mercy,\\" two steady rockers that kept my fists in the air.<br /><br />It's after these three rockers that KISS does something that threw me for a loop at first.  \\"Eat Your Heart Out\\" opens with the band singing acapella.  The complete lack of instruments after six loud, screaming, and electrified tracks is a bit of a shock, but somehow it works extremely well, as \\"Eat Your Heart Out\\" uses its humble opening to set you up for a slap in the face from the Demon!  It's one of the best tracks on the album, and its unique opening sets it apart from the rest of the tracks on the album.<br /><br />Next up is another Gene tune, \\"The Devil Is Me.\\"  Much like \\"Wall Of Sound,\\" it consistently dashes listeners on the rocks.  It's followed by the Tommy Thayer fronted \\"Outta This World.\\"  Despite the title referencing the old Space Ace moniker originally worn by Ace Frehley, Thayer makes this track all about him.  It does remind me a bit of \\"Lightning Strikes\\" from \\"Sonic Boom,\\" but I think that is primarily due to Thayer's voice.<br /><br />Following the Space Man's tune is the track that I personally believe is the best on the entire album.  Gene and Paul might not like me saying this, but Eric Singer's \\"All For The Love Of Rock & Roll\\" is brilliant.  It manages to harness the soul of classic KISS tracks that were inspired by bands from the 50's and 60's.  It's a metallized version of boogie soul, if that makes any sense.  It's not the hardest track on the album, but it is definitely my favorite.<br /><br />\\"Take Me Down Below\\" is next, and it finds Gene and Paul swapping lead vocals.  It's a token dirty track from the band, but it sounds new and fresh.<br /><br />\\"Last Chance\\" tops it all off with a fast and steady rock beat, and draws KISS' best album (in my opinion) since \\"Revenge\\" to a close.<br /><br />Overall, the main points I feel should be highlighted about this album is the fact that it's a rock n' roll record and nothing else.  KISS didn't try to make it the next \\"Destroyer\\" or go off an an experimental tangent as they did with \\"Music From The Elder.\\"  There are no slow songs, power ballads, or overly complicated tracks as the band did on many of their albums (particularly during the 80's).  Nope, there's nothing but a beatdown waiting for the listener here.<br /><br />Also, Gene's vocals are amazing on this album!  I've always believed that he had the best voice in the band over the years, despite not having the range of Paul Stanley.  He melds his voice to the \\"wall of sound\\" created by the instruments and doesn't sound like he's forcing anything.  Stanley does an excellent job as well, but I believe his best work came from putting this album together and producing it with Greg Collins.  While Gene might be the branding god of the group, Paul is the heart of the band, and his use of old fashioned analog recording equipment made the album sound ten times better than any polished digital music cranked out by today's bands.  Eric Singer established himself as KISS' drummer many moons ago, so it's no surprise that he handles his duties perfectly on \\"Monster.\\"  I really do wish he would get more lead vocal opportunities, though, as I believe he has a great voice.<br /><br />I'm going to single out Tommy Thayer in his own paragraph here.  Why?  Because with \\"Monster,\\" Thayer is finally given breathing room to play in his own style.  He was made to mimic Ace Frehley's style of playing on \\"Sonic Boom\\" to a degree and has often been criticized for being nothing more than a Frehley clone.  Those arguments should be null and void with the release of this album.  Thayer's chops are awesome on this album, and I found no \\"cloning\\" of the Space Ace in Thayer's work on this album.  He contributed writing to nine of the albums tracks, and it's very noticeable.<br /><br />\\"Monster\\" is a grinding, fierce album that lets everybody know that despite knocking hard on the door of their fourth decade of rock and roll, KISS has no plans to stop any time soon.<br /><br />This \\"Monster\\" is a beast!inds Gene and Paul swapping lead vocals.

0316228532|5.0|Slowness? What slowness?<br /><br />For JK Rowling's first journey outside of the [[ASIN:0545162076 Harry Potter]] series, she, in my mind, does not disappoint. From the death of Barry Fairbrother, Pagford is figuratively set ablaze as three different candidates fight for his seat. Drama ensues as they take different position on the Fields, which has been \\"corrupting\\" the town for decades.<br /><br />Of course, nothing's black and white.<br /><br />Even the purest person (Barry Fairbrother) was blindly idealistic, and the cruelest (Simon or Obbo) have their moments. Everyone else? They run the spectrum. You can't help but love some of them, and hate the others--and then get all tense for them.<br /><br />That's the strength of this book. Character.<br /><br />Really, the plot might not be exciting, but the intrigue going on is enough to make this a story I'll be reading again in a few months, and then a few months after that.<br /><br />The setting is realized. More than one passage defines Mrs. Rowling's wordcraft. She also handles the unexpected maturity in an effective way. Sex is not glorified, and she makes her point with the stink that pops up every once in a while.<br /><br />Oh, and everything concerning [[ASIN:B001B67VZE Rihanna's \\"Umbrella\\"]] is hilarious.<br /><br />Stick with it for more than a hundred pages, and it'll pay off.
B003VS0CYC|1.0|this boxset is absolutly unnecesary.<br />the movies audio and video are ok, but they don't have any extras, just the trailers and that`s it.<br />I don`t understand why the studio edit such a piece of crap. The dvd edition is so MUCH better.<br /><br />Shame on you MGM.
0446569895|4.0|the book arrived in good time didn't have to wait 3 weeks or so.book was in pretty good shape for a used book.outside of a slightly yellowed condition on edges of pages the pages were in great shape no defects a good buy all around.very pleased with purchase and would definatly do again.
B009AMAKJU|5.0|From watching the trailer, I got a slight understanding of the film; guy has no friends when he starts his first year in high school and struggles to make them also, he then finally meets some nice people who befriend him, which to one he falls in love with.<br /><br />Whilst the base of the story is just as I had predicted, the film as a whole was so much more.<br /><br />Charlie who is the main character is extremely socially awkward, and you get hints close to the beginning that something in his past had caused him to be this way, eventually you start finding out Charlie has a very deep story in the past which is gradually explained through as the film goes on by flash-backs, you will eventually find out why he is the person he is today, this combined with the journey through his first year with his new friends who also have different personal issues makes this film an emotional roller-coaster.<br /><br />I don't want to ruin the story for those who haven't seen it, so I'm not going to go into further detail.<br /><br />On a final note, I do want to point out that the cast for this film was perfect, they were all brilliant at their roles and made the film very believable.  I also want to say Emma Watson did an especially good job at portraying her character 'Sam'.  As she's widely recognised for playing Hermione from the Harry Potter films, it must have been hard for her to shake off that image that has been imprinted into peoples minds throughout these years, which she has done so brilliantly in this film, this shows how good she is of an actress.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this film for those who enjoy drama/romantic based films and I certainly will be buying this film when it comes out on DVD/Blu-ray.
B004UID2LC|5.0|I've had this app for quite some time, and until September's update, it was working very well.  Now, with the most recent update, it's working again.  I like the simplicity of this app, and the fact that you can go for either a full video, or just MP3.
0316228532|2.0|The writing is solid, JK Rowling is a very good writer. And there were interesting bits peppered throughout the book, but for a 500 page novel, I needed more to be happening & for those parts to be more frequent. There is a lot of slow parts.<br /><br />I think part of my dislike too is that there really wasn't a character that I rooted for or was invested in. And that includes so called \\"bad guys\\", it's not that I need a hero to enjoy a book, if a protaganist is written well you can be just as invested as with a hero. But overall the people who fill Rowling's small town are boring. I even would have enjoyed it they were actually more evil, instead they are trapped in a place where they're mostly just jerks.<br /><br />I wish I could say I liked the book more but just not enough happened & the characters are desperate & lackluster.
B005MMJ84K|5.0|After reading delirium I was devastated at the end!  I was so angry that Lena did not get a happy ending that I did not want to read Pandemonium.  I didn't think I was going to be able to handle Lena being with a new boy right after Alex died.  Thankfully I gave this book a try because honestly I think it's even better than delirium in so many ways.  The book is set up as \\"Then\\" and \\"Now\\" chapters which adds more tension to the end of each chapter as you are waiting to find out what happens in both time periods, but it is not confusing or hard to follow.  It moves the book along perfectly!  Lena's grief is not ignored either.  We feel how devastated she is and how she works through it.  Although I do not like most of the \\"Wilds\\" characters they are written very well.  I know a lot of people do not like the way this book ends but I don't think it could work any other way.  Overall this book is excellently written, very exciting, and well worth reading!

B004ZJZPWA|4.0|As mid October rolls around, brisk winds sweep through the crisp autumn air, jack o'lanterns decorate steps and porches, the scent of wood smoke radiates from wood stoves, and the leaves are in their peak season of color. October is a magnificent month, and in celebration of its annual visit, I've decided to review a few great flicks for the Halloween season. The titles that I've chosen to review are \\"alternative\\" Halloween movies... not the classics that generally spring to mind, but fun movies with elements of the supernatural. Just good, lighthearted stuff here... nothing gory or scary!<br /><br />\\"Van Helsing\\" is my favorite Halloween movie of all time. Film purists complain that this movie is low brow, or that it defiles the canon of classic monster mythology. But this isn't true! \\"Van Helsing\\" is about having a good time, while putting a fun spin on the heavy hitters of our monster classics- Dracula, the Wolfman, and Frankenstein's Monster. Heck, even Mr. Hyde makes an appearance, as well as a few other interesting beasties. Hugh Jackman's performance is just right, with a good balance of comedy and action chops. Looks great on Blu-ray, and there's nothing in here that's too gory or scary for the kids. A great Halloween movie to enjoy with friends and some hot chocolate.
1781161313|4.0|The book came on time and in excelent condition. Although not alot of facts or photos of the \\"Aliens\\" film. you have a plethoria of fact about the colonial marines. Enough to say that if I were 40 years younger I would consider joining them.<br />the technical side is very very good and believable<br />worth ev ery penney/cent
0783227434|5.0|As mid October rolls around, brisk winds sweep through the crisp autumn air, jack o'lanterns decorate steps and porches, the scent of wood smoke radiates from wood stoves, and the leaves are in their peak season of color. October is a magnificent month, and in celebration of its annual visit, I've decided to review a few great flicks for the Halloween season. The titles that I've chosen to review are \\"alternative\\" Halloween movies... not the classics that generally spring to mind, but fun movies with elements of the supernatural. Just good, lighthearted stuff here... nothing gory or scary!<br /><br />One such movie is the cult classic, \\"AOD\\". Small on budget, but big on comedy, this flick is hilarious. This is B-actor legend Bruce Campbell in his prime, belting out such classic gems as, \\"Hail to the king, baby,\\" and \\"This is my boomstick!\\" The third in the \\"Evil Dead\\" trilogy, this movie is actually best when judged on its own. It's where Sam Raimi really earned his chops. Just be warned: it's the type of humor that you either get, or don't. As such, it's a love it/hate it type affair, best appreciated by children of the 80s and 90s. If you think that a guy with a metal hand, a chainsaw, and a shotgun blasting hordes of undead creatures in a medieval time period sounds funny, then AOD is for you.
B008JAGZDE|5.0|In keeping with the American Pie movies,  this was a super next step.  Very funny! If there is a next one it will have to be super.
B0014D6PCO|5.0|As mid October rolls around, brisk winds sweep through the crisp autumn air, jack o'lanterns decorate steps and porches, the scent of wood smoke radiates from wood stoves, and the leaves are in their peak season of color.

The titles that I've chosen to review are \\"alternative\\" Halloween movies... not the classics that generally spring to mind, but fun movies with elements of the supernatural. Just good, lighthearted stuff here... nothing gory or scary (at least not too much)!<br /><br />\\"Batman Begins\\" is an exceptional movie, no matter how you want to judge it- drama, superhero adaptation, or action movie. What I particularly loved about it was how it gave a credible origin to the legend of Batman. Rather than just asking the viewer to accept that Bruce Wayne has a ridiculously high aptitude for stealth and combat, director Christopher Nolan SHOWS us why this is. Wayne's training in a remote sanctuary of ninjas, as he slowly acquires his remarkable skills, is fascinating and engaging. This is a movie that benefits greatly from the HD transfer to Blu-ray, and it is a treat for the eyes to witness this legendary character's origins.<br /><br />And let's not forget, \\"Batman Begins\\" works perfectly as an \\"alternative\\" Halloween movie, as this crisp October weather rolls in. After all, it features a very cool villain called \\"Scarecrow\\", whose weapon is nothing less than fear itself... the story of \\"Batman Begins\\" will draw you in from the first moments, and hold your attention until the final, climactic battle.
B009329ZF2|5.0|Awersome movie. Really enjoyed it. Hope they come out with a sequeal. If you like action and some funny comments then this one is for you.
B005OHSQPA|5.0|Hands down, my favorite show on tv!  Drama, violence, nudity, guns, suspense and believable characters. Each character has his/her own dilemmas which add even more depth to the plots in each episode. Love it!
0061997811|5.0|I love this book! It is so amazing with all the take outs and information etc. every harry potter fan should have it!
B0027MJU00|3.0|I have to admit that I thought the \\"who-done-it\\" was someone completely different than what was actually discovered by the end of the book.  The writing irritated me going back and forth every other chapter between the past and the present.  I would go days without picking the book up, almost dreading reading more.  It was a real strain for me to keep reading.  I really just wanted to get it over with and move onto another book.
1608870081|5.0|so pretty! Once in a while I open the book again to look. I love it! if you're thinking about buying it, you should! worth every penny.
0307346617|3.0|Book was good reading for the first half.  I lost interest after that because there was not enough pages devoted to what I consider to be the most interesting part of the zombie genre - - the time between when the break-out starts and the world collapses.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|This is a compelling, smart, historically entertaining roller coaster of a ride. I immediately began reading Book 2!  Loved it.
B00004YRQA|5.0|I have two of this item and they said that it can work on Save points from a PSone game but the ones I have doesn't seem to be doing that. I'm wondering if it was False Advertizing or what. If anyone knows the truth about wether or not PS2 memory Cards can work with PSone game Save points Please let me know. I have a PS2 that I play the PSone game on. Maybe that's why the save point won't load. I'm not sure.
B0085OEA9U|5.0|Clooney uses his acting talent to show us a man who is happy for now.  He has no attachments save his job and his goal of earning X frequent flier miles.  This all gets turned topsy-turvey when two women enter his life, one young and ambitious out to depreciate him and the other a love interest.  Both highlight his attachments.  In spite of his self-improvement lightening-of-your-backpack don't-get-attached speeches, he finds himself weighed down by his attachment to his job and a woman he sees occasionally when criss-crossing the country.  Both lead to misery when his job is in jeopardy and he falls for a casual acquaintance.  Unable to keep his distance, he winds up on the doorstep of a disappointing relationship while finding that human misery helps him keep his job.  The end sees him walking the line between attachment being misery as Buddhism teaches and human misery being the driving force behind how he makes his living.  The misery of other people sucks, but somehow, people are worse off without it.<br /><br />Watch this movie, but keep your backpack light.

B008BGNMZU|4.0|Espirit De Four is the 10th Four Play CD in my collection and each one gets better.  I have been a Bob James fan since the \\"Theme from Taxi\\" and his smooth style never disappoints.  The vocals of Nathan East are always a big plus.
B003VANOFY|5.0|This head set is awesome works very good and go's far. Bass is awesome, i love mine only down fall is mine cuts out some times odd but I found out what it might be :) anyhow it's awesome.
B0016OLC5Q|5.0|You had to buy a two disc DVD set to get all the features of this one blu-ray.  This movie will haunt me to my dying day and this blu-ray will help with that.  Great picture and sound and it has the documentaries to boot.  I recorded the documentary \\"Call of the Wild\\" from PBS and have included it with this blu-ray to make it the ultimate Chris McCandliss super set.  This is what we buy HD TV's for!  One of the best American movies ever made and I can't believe that sonofabitch Sean Penn made it.  Bravo!
B005ES0XVO|4.0|I use my Croc Duet sport for quick errands or just to take a walk with my dog. If you owned a pair of crocs then you know the comfortability is there. For first time buyers this a great croc clog to start with. The duet sport feels like it has a bit more cushion and bounce to it. The sides of the clog kinda have that reebok zig or Nike free look so its a bit more trendy looking I suppose. I personally dont mind the croc clog look but if you want to try some croc clogs that don't look to uhhh crocky..lol..then get a pair of the sport duet. They have a pair in which the grey color is on top but I opted for the black cause the color tone just seems better that way. 4 stars only cause like other crocs it can get a bit (or a lot depending on your feet)sweaty on hotter days even with the holes all over it. Yes order a half size down from your regular shoe size as they do run a half size big. I usually wear a 10 1/2 and a 10 fits nicely. Yes they are wide but that's what's great about croc clogs. No squeez feeling almost like a sandle/slipper feel. I would reccomend to others looking for a whatever quick yet more durable then a slipper type feet gear to have.
0062082353|5.0|But some have complained that he doesn't go into detail about his kills. However, he does go into his equipment, but first and foremost, this is a biography--not just a chronicle of his military career. Please know that before buying. I loved his wife Taya's insights. The families left back stateside often get forgotten. They sacrifice a lot too.

B005PM3YII|5.0|The mistborn series does take a while to get the ball rolling, but once it does it is unstoppable! It all comes together in one great book right where it counts!
B004EPYZPS|3.0|I haven't been particularly wound up in the films of Spielberg.  \\"Jaws\\" was fantastic.  He often repeats himself a bit too closely and when another director follows his lead, the results could be disastrous.  This film wasn't as bad as some people have been led to think.  They're married to the style and overly involved in a type of movie that by now leads to repetition and cliche.  For those of us not buried in this genre, the film has its good points.<br />The kids played their parts quite well, for the main part.  The girl was outstanding.<br />The last shots near the end of the film made the kids look ten years older and that didn't work out at all.  The music was strictly by the numbers but it's exhilirating<br />to hear a full orchestra.  There were no real themes or development.  I personally stopped caring about the monster somewhere midway in the film.<br />The situation and the drama are aimed directly at the audience, as if, somehow, somebody had rated each scene according to saleability and then strung them together.<br />The tricks have been done before in other films but then again so have the Sherlock Holmes films or the Thin Man series, or Star Trek...The list is enormous.  There's nothing inherently bad in repeating success.  Hollywood has been doing it for over a hundred years.  When the repetition is ham-fisted, though, it does become quite annoying and this was ham-fisted all right.  However the film does fly by, there are no \\"dead\\" moments until the saccharine ending which aims at the heartstrings but reaches the bile of the viewer instead.  Anyone could have organized a more efficient ending. I did enjoy most of the film, though, and the production values helped it out in a big way.<br /><br />Curtis Stotlar
B0099G6Q5E|3.0|Yes, the a cappella arrangements that the groups sing in this movie are the highlight...and they're all here. But I was so excited to get my hands on some of the other great music from the movie: like Becca's remixes! Awesome stuff that should have been included! This could have been a much more well-rounded \\"fun beats\\" collection of songs. As it stands it's just a highlights collection of the singing groups. These songs however are still great.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|If you like this type of game, you'll love this one. This game is a great way to waste time.
0446580848|5.0|First, let me start by reminding Amazonians that this should be a place for reviews of the book itself, not for complaints about pricing and availability. I'm a writer with published books on Amazon, and it is very damaging and disheartening to read 1-star reviews which have nothing to do with the content or quality of my work. Please, people, be aware that your words here do have an effect. Even a well-established writer like Mr. DeMille can be affected by them. I know I am. As for Kindle pricing, those are set by the publisher. Amazon has nothing to do with it. Neither does the writer. If you have a complaint, write to the publisher.<br /><br />Now, as to the book itself. In recent years I came to feel that Mr. DeMille had lost some of his power. I wasn't a huge fan of \\"Wild Fire\\" or \\"The Gate House,\\" but with \\"The Lion\\" and now \\"The Panther,\\" he is back at the top of his game. \\"The Panther\\" is the DeMille we all came to love. Full of action, suspense, and a terrific cast of characters. He truly paints a portrait of the confusing nature of war, and creates a universe where each person may or may not be what they seem. This is not easy to do, and he pulls it off magnificently.<br /><br />He's also the master of slow-building suspense. But the build-up itself is never boring. He keeps us entertained even as he's setting us up for the payoff. This is nearly impossible in the days of instant action, when our short attention spans demand constant bombardment. I enjoyed \\"The Panther\\" as much as the best of his books. In fact, I think it might even be his best. That's truly saying something for a writer who's been in the game so long. Well done, Mr. DeMille! You've proven that old boys like us can still bring it on.
B009329ZF2|5.0|This was a very entertaining movie with lots of action.  The effects are great.  It was very speacial to see real life veterans and very proud.
0345803485|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. I couldn't put it down. Read all three books in a week in a half.
0525952926|5.0|This book was excellent. As usual Ken Follett never disappoints. His ability to define characters is matched by no one. I cannot wait to read the third book in the trilogy.
B0091REZMW|4.0|this is a great game.  the only thing that I don't like is it takes to long to build up energy and there is not enough diamonds
B007V2UGPE|5.0|the title says it all. this game makes ya strategize while giving you upgrades and unlockables to keep it interesting. This is my favorite time wasting app besides Battleheart
B001KVZ6HK|4.0|I enjoyed this movie and recommend it for kids 12 years and older.<br />I was only familiar with iron man and the hulk.  Not sure what the other super heros do but very entertaining dialog.
B008GVD6D8|4.0|After reading Bared to you I really couldnt wait for this book which is the follow up but their was just a little something missing from it compared to book 1, not sure what it was but I still enjoyed it, i think maybe it was just a little bit too repetitive in too many places and kinda got a little bit boring midways through it but it picked up again for the last few chapters, however I am not knocking it a good read ladies xx
B007RTAR64|5.0|The Katniss Everdeen Barbie Doll came in today and I opened it up and it is just beautiful!  I cannot wait to give this to my friend for Christmas!  The doll seems to be durably made and is very appealing to the eye.

B001BANK32|4.0|I have been hearing many good things about Stephen King's books so I decided to get the Shining.  I will say that from the beginning of the book, it had you guessing on what was going to happen next.  I was a book, that if you put it down, you could not wait to pick up again to continue reading.
B008PZ69T8|4.0|I wish I had heard the music before I ordered the disc. After listening to the the clasical music I began to enjoy the music. The Tannis selection makes me think of medieval monks living in a monastery. The Bach selection the last song on the album was my favorite. The more I listen to the album the more I like the music. It was worth buying.  signed braveheart Purchased from Amazon.com

B004EPYZZI|5.0|This is one of my top ten ever fav. My Mom loved this movie too. I hope the book is as good.
B0081U0HKY|5.0|Storyline is very unique.  Loved this movie.  I especially love the cast and the story line.  Yes there are some holes but overall it brought some fresh ideas to the screen and I am always up for a new story instead of the same boring crap hollywood pumps out on a regular basis.
0345803485|5.0|This book is everything I thought it would be...a good read! I suggest ordering the other two books of the trilogy as well (Fifty Shades Darker and Fifty Shades Freed). ;)
B0084IG7KC|1.0|First off Pita was cast by some whiny punk kid from Zathura....need I say more.  Katniss was a fine choice with Jennifer, Stanley Tucci did a great job, Woody Harrelson was lame, most of the other characters were okay except for the kids.  This seems to be about as cliff notes of a book to movie as one could really get only touching on about 30% of the content that was in the book.  I was very excited to see this movie and left the theatre wanting my time and money back.  Everyone is raving about the movie but I feel it is just poor acting and bad script writing.  I could only see lame Twilight droolers loving this one.
B0054SMID0|5.0|I have to admit, I've become a bit jaded when it comes to current legal drama films, but \\"The Lincoln Lawyer\\" was soooo freaking good. It's good to see Matt McC doing drama like this - I think he reminds the world that he isn't just another pretty face with this one. It reminds me of Primal Fear, with the protagonist being brought back down to the level of us humans, and Matt McC really delivers. The plot twists were great, and the cast was great. It's always great to see William H. Mac, Marisa Tomei and Francis Fisher onscreen. And the soundtrack... I know this is about a film, but the soundtrack is so perfect, it really does push the film further than just a good film. Kudos to the actors and filmmakers for this film - I needed it after watching a bunch of junk called suspenseful drama.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Loved the 3D experience and it was my first on my new 3D HDTV.  Need I say more?  Cant wait for the next series of movies in this story arc.
B001H1SVO8|5.0|This movie is absolutely amazing! My favorite Edward Norton movie. One of Brad Pitt's best as well! If you don't mind a little violence then I would highly recommend this movie.
B005LAIIQC|3.0|Not as good as the previous three installments but the characters are solid and the storyline is good.  I dont know if I would buy this movie at full price....we will see.
B007THA4FI|4.0|At first there were so many characters so quickly that I became somewhat confused trying to follow the setups, but if you stick with it, about a third of the way through, the story takes off and it is the vintage J.K. Rowling that you were hoping to meet once again. I thoroughly enjoyed this effort, and it became a real page turner in very short order. This is a very adult J.K. Rowling in both the use of language and in the tough issues that she investigates.
1878424319|5.0|My wife loves this book though I have not read it yet.  She wanted it for our anniversary and the price was right $1.18 or something like that.  Good deals on books here.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|I have been unable to read anything else since I started the Game of Thrones series!  Although the books are long, they are easy to pick back up after a break, because the story flows so naturally.  I had my doubts at first about how good such a long book series could be, but I'm a believer.
B005LAIHEA|1.0|Terrible movie.  You feel like you are clueless as each scene unfolds without much connection to the next scene.  Random over the top nonsense ensues in many scenes such as pretending to have a conversation as cookie monster and elmo or singing a song about all the women the groom has nailed.  This movie only had one inspiring moment.  When the chef makes eggs benedict for the newly engaged couple.  It inspired me to try and make eggs benedict using this formula.  Aside from this the movie was pointless, confusing, and dull.
B0068LYEHA|5.0|Such a fun fresh look at being a woman.  Giving a copy to all my sisters this Christmas!  Two Thumbs up
B002BWP49M|1.0|I hate twighlight the movies, the books, but as far as all media is concerned this is definitely the most BOOORING movie in the series.  2 hours of wedding scenes and the two characters making kissy face or having a measuring contest among the vampire and chihuahua dude.  TERRIBLE MOVIE
B005LAJ16I|5.0|Since we don't subscribe to Showtime, we had to wait until this series was available on DVD. We received it, and promptly watched every episode in a mini-marathon over several nights....It is well made, actors are believable (the TV Emmys the show received were deserved in my opinion)and production values and writing were top-notch.....looking forward to this 2nd season, and possibly a friend who will tape the episodes for us.....Frightening in its realism, but with all that has happened in the Middle-east recently, Arab Spring, Libya, etc, etc. you sometimes feel you are watching a documentary.....

0224097385|3.0|Ian McEwan's \\"Sweet Tooth\\", the supposed name of the MI5 operation to disabuse the populace of communist sympathies during the Cold War of the 1970's, is carried by a plot whose subject is, superficially, about MI5 and spies but, ultimately, a story of the tensions between love and deception.<br />This becomes clearer as we see McEwan build the character of Serena Frome, an attractive middle-classed woman educated at prestigious Cambridge University, her father a bishop and yet her choice of men is either so hurried as to be ill-judged or else purely capricious as she works her way unsuccessfully through several partners.<br />One lover turns out to be a homosexual, another lightning relationship with an older lecturer collapses and still another leads to a job at MI5, the man, apart from the glamour of his job turning out to be a singularly clumsy lover until she hits finally settles on on an author, Tom Haley, from whom she must struggle to conceal the nature of her work.<br />The tension, for me, was not so much in the vein of the conventional spy novel but in the web of intrigue and deception between the characters themselves. Even so, interminable weekend encounters used to test the skill of each in hiding their secrets began to jar on me and though the ending tends to justify the slow development, it did require, at times, superhuman patience to keep reading for the denouement.
B006M9NJFG|5.0|Upon initial inspection, I found this to be a great product albeit extremely unattractive. I also find the product to be of solid construction and feel it will last a lifetime. I appreciate the double stitching on the neoprene jacket.<br />I did do a couple modifications to help \\"fix the ugly\\" and make it more tactical and useful in a real world/backpacking scenario.<br />Here is what I did step by step:<br />1) I blacked out the orange markings on the carrying case/jacket.<br />2) I cut off the plastic orange cap holder from the bottom and left the top attached trimming and rounding it at about 2 inches length.<br />3) I centered a hole in the plastic cap holder<br />4) I tied 550 paracord to the bottle neck in the same grove the lip holder used to ride.<br />5) By coincidence and shear stroke of genius, I found that the [[ASIN:B003XEANHK Vinturi 5-Pack Filter Screens]] happens to fit perfectly in the neck of the bottle with a excellent tight fit. I recommend you get some. It's the best part of my mod.<br />6) I drilled a small whole into the neck of the filter and used a fishing swivel to hook to the cord (so it is captured and slide-able) and clipped the other end to the filter.<br />7) I tied a stop knot with the 550 and placed a 4mm brass washer on over the knot slipped it thru the cap holder placing another 4mm brass washer, then finally tying a final lock knot on top.<br />8) I melted the paracord ends to prevent fraying and to ensure the knot will not come undone.<br />9) I blackened the remaining portion of the lid holder b/c it remained ugly orange.<br />10) I removed the survival guide (comes with it) placing it in a small plastic bag and putting in the jacket below the cup, and have used the side pocket to now house water purification tablets I have shrink wrapped to fit. I have also placed a backup magnesium fire rod in the pocket as well. The fire striker will help you boil your finely strained water.<br /><br />By doing this I have taken away all theugly visible orange (yes the cup is orange but it is concealed in the case and will blacken overtime the more I use it on the fire. This also makes it much more tactical for those of you who don't want to given away by your neon orange canteen.  Additionally, you will have a perfect fitting, fine mesh screen for which to keep junk out of the water when filling up in the field.<br />I hope this helps you to make a decision to not only purchase item this but to have a higher functioning water system by your side for when you are on the go with these small but insightful (I think) modifications.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|awesome graphics and nice games. gets interesting as we progress and timed round makes it more interesting. very nice to keep playing
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|love it! its easy and a little addictive. its more fun than you think. plus its free. cant go wrong with this one.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|The story line was good.  That was what keep me reading it.  I liked the fact that it  took place  in  Seattle and I was familiar with all the sites the author brought into the story line.  However I felt the story was secondly soft core porn.  The author really could have cut back on all the sex and sadism  and it still would have been a god book.  The book leaves the reader hanging at the end.<br />In other words something  serious is going to happen, then the book closes.  So the reader knows there will be a fourth book.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this game is good to relax with for a few mins a day.  as you work your way up you regen more coins. It's fun.  makes me wanna go to chucky cheese and play the real game.
B002BWP49C|5.0|Good 4th installment of the Twilight Saga. Disc arrived in a timely manner. And disc worked which is a plus. (I ordered a disc from Amazon brand new one time and it didn't work).<br />Alot of people rag on Twilight. It's not for everyone but for those who truly enjoy the Twilight series will like this next part of the story and leaves you hanging for the final part.

B009SJ46EA|5.0|This season looks awesome.<br />I love it that I can get the episode without commercials :)<br /><br />Loved the first season and if you havent seen it there is no problem when watching the new one as it is a completele different story.
B007AL48UK|5.0|fun shapes and easy to play, works well, some shapes are hard and some are easy, nice mis up to suit mood
B008MEM24S|4.0|This game is like where's my water but the maps are easier. If you have kids and they like where's my water, they will love this game. You on the other hand might think its a little to easy. BUT for .99 cents its worth it, plus its the first edition so I am sure that new maps are to come.
B007DA2FHG|3.0|Was disappointed that dvd was not full screen.My tv is led whivh is supposed to allow for a brighter pictures but many scenes were very dark and hard to distinguish persons & places. Would like to exchange my dvd for full screen and hope that it would be beer viewing. The war scenes with Calvary in full gallop and the many horses used had to be a hard task to accomplish.<br />Let me know if my dvd can be exchanged<br />teba

B009AMALLM|5.0|I was a fan of the first Paranormal Activity 1, back in 2001, mainly because I'm an independent thinker who enjoys seeing movies not because everyone says to see them due to some buzz. I hated Paranormal Activity 2, mainly because I hate sequels, which is exactly why I then immediately loved Paranormal Activity 3. I was hoping for an awesomer time with this gem, Paranormal Activity 4, and I totally was not disappointed at all!<br /><br />Paranormal Activity 4 sees the return of one Katie, who had been absent since 3. Her reappearance, midway through 4 and very abruptly, is basically explained by a reference to her making a wrong turn on the freeway and then getting lost in some \\"black\\" neighborhood or something like that. Now I'm sure no racism at all was planned--hold on a second, I just have to go to the bathroom right now because I had too much Mountain Dew to drink--but I still found this explanation about as believable as Barack Hussein Obama claiming that a YouTube video was the reason behind American ambassador Chris Stevens' murder!<br /><br />I won't give the ending away, yet let's just say that the Dracula fellow from Bram Stoker's Dracula and also even the stupid-looking Asian girl from the Grudge make a brief cameo. Needless to say, I was not expecting to see this, but since I love highly original and totally unpredictable films, I give Paranormal Activity 4 two middle fingers up...way up!
B007L3BMGA|1.0|I tried to like this book. I honestly did, but I just had to give up half-way into chapter five because I realised my sanity was in danger. Like most other reviewers, I grew weary of all the repetitive \\"Oh my\\", \\"Holy crap\\" and biting of lips. Fast-forward to all the juicy bits and nothing happened. Insipid. Tedious. Did absolutely nothing for me \\"down there\\". Irritating female protagonist who deserved the administering of fifty shades of blue. In short, absolutely no literary merit whatsoever, and even the bits that are supposed to light the fires of desire are as sexy as a wet fart.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Ken Follett has written another historically accurate enjoyable book.  A must read for history junkies.  The second book, in this fascinating trilogy is equally as good. He nails his characters and interweaves historical facts with his characters lives. Wish there were more writers like him. Can not wait for the final book.
B00063F8B2|5.0|This is a fast shipper and item was exactly as described.  Would recommend this item, love the extra songs.  Thanks
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|I'm so happy they finally made this game free for kindle. I absolutely adore this game. I play it on my samsung galaxy player and it keeps me busy and engaged. its a nice challenge and now I can play it on a bigger screen. so thank you thank you rovio. I was never a big fan of the angry bird games but I'm totally hooked on these bad piggies!!!
0812992784|5.0|Great autobiography of Salman Rushdie writing as a third person. Not only does it make this an important story about the freedom of speech but also the freedom of the written word. Salman is great on writing and speaking about the harms of suppression towards not only writing and speech but about humanity's inhumanity towards those who dare to think and want for a better education. From his decade of hiding from those who wanted him dead to his freedom to move about in a free society. This story is something that all who champion free speech should read and cherish.

0812992784|5.0|Joseph Anton: A Memoir ranks with memoirs of the greats, for example Rousseau, Chateaubriand, Nabokov. It is a testimony to the values of humanism that makes for fascinating reading.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book is the next installment of the Hero's of Olympus series and it was so good! I love anything by Rick Riordan and he has made another awesome book. This book brings together Camp Half-Blood and Camp Jupiter and it was so cool! I love this book!!!

1401201911|5.0|I have been wanting to read this book for years, but never got around to purchasing a copy.  When I saw that it was on Amazon I decided to leap at the chance.  I was not disappointed.<br /><br />The book was in great condition when it arrived.  I felt guilty even opening it due to its great condition, but books are made to be enjoyed.  I loved this alternate timeline story and I recommend anyone who is a fan of the superman character should pick this up and read it.
B007MNV5WU|4.0|This was better than I expected, and I even paid for the Danger Zone levels (extra 99 cents).  The cute piggies snooze inside their space suits while waiting for the birds to hit them.  The graphics are really well done, and like all the other AB games, I can hardly wait for the updates.
B0054LVP3Q|4.0|I just read this book on vacation.  I kept having to put it down and pick it up but that was ok because there was a lot of repetition (part of the story line).  I really enjoyed it and suspected that there would be a good twist at the end but it wasn't what I thought.  So I was pleasantly surprised!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love this book series i bet the other books are going to be interesting.your book series is going to be awsome!
B0013TPVGK|5.0|I buy it accidentally, ok not soo accidentally, but looking at the page of this book on Kindle magically pressed the buy button. I do not regret it! Now I know, this book makes me to buy himself! Easy to read, easy to understand, friendly voice and clean ideas. ... and not only for musicians.
B000TEPJOY|5.0|Cannonball, Miles et al at the peak of their game. The quintessential version of Autumn Leaves ever ever ever recorded. Serious competition with all other contenders as the greatest Jazz album ever.Forget all the intellectual verbose jazz reviews: bring Autumn Leaves with you into a grove of fall maples/aspens/sycamores and listen to the groove. You'll be transformed.<br /> A
B0082Z1CVQ|4.0|I managed somehow to never read this book as a youngster but corrected that when I was in my 20s.  Since it had been so many years (about 30) and I was getting ready to read [[ASIN:B0029WILXU March]] by Geraldine Brooks, I wanted to go back and re-read this first novel.<br /><br />As many other reviewers have said, this story starts off quite slowly and I was initially disappointed.  It wasn't the book I remembered.  Deciding to stick with it, I kept going and it picked up steam as it went along becoming the book I enjoyed previously.<br /><br />I wonder how young girls react to this now when \\"The Hunger Games\\" and \\"Gossip Girl\\" seem to be the norm and are so vastly different from this.  The early stages are sugary sweet and there is quite a bit of preaching on religion and morals throughout that might make the younger ones roll their eyes a bit.  While it has largely aged well, it must be read for the time period in which it was written.<br /><br />I am very glad I re-read it as an adult.
B007XNAQL0|5.0|Peter Gabriel's performance cements his stardom as a on stage performer at the highest level. He is more on stage than the sum of his studio work.He is one of the only acts that I have ever seen. That involves the whole band and makes it about the performance and not him.Not likely to be found in todays contempary acts.After seeing one of his shows it will take days for what you saw to settle in. A glow that lasts a life time.
B007GCY8FS|1.0|I can't believe I'm thinking this: I may not bother to finish a Reacher book.<br /><br />Another huge fan here--I own them all and anticipate each new book for months.  For the first hundred pages or so, I was a happy camper as it started out great. Then it just slowly lost all momentum. The plot is tedious, convoluted, and has far too many government acronyms for me to even follow.<br /><br />I second those who suspect that Child outsourced the heavy lifting on this one. When did Child develop chapteritis? It is permissible to have a chapter longer than three pages long...we can handle it, I promise.<br /><br />Very, very disappointing.  While I'm at it, please tell me Tom Cruise as Reacher is just a terrible rumor. I can't think of a single actor less capable of pulling off this role; what a waste of what once was a truly compelling and original character.
B008DB3N5W|5.0|Please Manowar brothers:<br /><br />Don't listen to all of those so called \\"fans from day one\\" and people who is downgrading this masterpiece. What you have here is 10 killer catchy songs, with ultraheavy riffs and killer production. So now a loud bass lines annoys some guys?!? Doesn't matter! He is Joey DeMaio! At least we have a bass player we can hear! And personally loved that buzz, it has a live vibe which is very cool. The rest of the guys are superb: Eric is singing better than ever, Karl fits perfect and Donnie knows how to hit the drumkit! They are awesome! And the songs kick ass!!! Let them listen to the album 10-15 times more.... they will change their opinion, for sure!<br /><br />If only people hear the music again on hifi instead of those phones! This music sounds perfect!!!<br /><br />Is \\"Touch the sky\\" a bad, boring song!?!?!? Maybe \\"Born in a grave\\"? Or the title track??!? No!!! They are supercool, as any other in this fantastic CD, which reminds me of old classics from the 80's... Hey, I know what people want: Louder than Hell 2, or Warriors 2, or Kings of Metal redux... but Manowar needed this album on their discography. Some of us really follow the band from day 1, and I'm sure we all love this amazing CD, and, why not, we were expecting not another fast ultratight ten songs of demons spitting fire while the brothers of metal raise the hammers to the crimson sky. Please note Manowar is a classic band, with classsic roots and here they just showed they're just this:<br /><br />Classic.<br /><br />And the best part, to see them live. A few days ago they made a brutal gig in Madrid, and the new songs sounded like if they were always there.<br /><br />Please real Manowar fans: buy this album, support the band, go to see 'em live and enjoy this songs they gave us, because you will do it for the rest of your life.<br /><br />Thanks Joey, Eric, Karl and Donnie for staying true to yourselves, that's what metal is all about.
B007XNAQPG|5.0|I have to admit that I am a rabid duranie, so I love watching the boys in concert. This production brought back memories of many shows I've been to, where I have never been dissapointed. Excellent production, well worth the price.
B0042AGN78|3.0|[[VIDEOID:mo3IW9HKGSJ2UXC]]Bad Boys, Bad Boys II???<br /><br />Amazon has for some reason they have combined 2 completely different films into the review section.  I am surprised that Amazon has not rectified this problem.  For a long time Amazon has been putting movie reviews for all formats from VHS tapes to Blu-ray discs into a single review section.  There have been complaints in the review sections of 100's of movie reviews.  Complaints about one release for example, a DVD bare bones release vs. a 2 disc Limited Edition in the same section will cause reviews that will make no sense.  If a customer is looking through the reviews to help them decide whether to buy the Limited Edition of a movie and they read review after review complaining about the bare bones DVD release being horrible can cause a person to not buy the Limited Edition or Blu-ray because they are see all of the old stale reviews.<br /><br />Separate the reviews NOW!!
B000P6PVLC|2.0|The beginning story line was very good. Not knowing exactly what the movie entailed, I was very confused when the movie changed to the story in Japan which I felt had nothing to do with the beginning story. I thought it was some X-rated movie that somehow got spliced into another movie. I would not have watched it. It took me three times trying to finish the story in Morocco before I realized the kind of movie it was. I even had money refunded for my Kindle because I didn't know what the movie was and apparently they wasn't aware of it at Amazon. Loved the Brad Pitt part.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|I very much enjoy everything that Ken Follett writes so I bought the book on the first day of it´s release. The characters of the first volume are present but the story is basically about their children. Of course, they are always at the right time at the right spot, privileged spectators of what´s happening at the time. But who cares if it´s too much of a coincidence? Follett does manage to transmit, in entertaining language, the political climate of the time so you can understand why things took place. Fall of giants had more endearing characters so that made a difference for me. I believe so many things happened during WW II that Follett had a harder time focusing on the characters and the story at the same time. But I thoroughly liked the book and read it straight on. And I shall definitely await for the last volume of the trilogy!
B0097VS7ZS|5.0|I am 64 years old and have always loved to color. It is great and my grandchildren use it also.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book is so good I wish there was a third one I have read this book twice already can't wait for my friends to read it also
0374214913|5.0|I started this book in the middle of the night when I couldn't sleep, thinking I'd read a few pages, that would settle me down and I'd drift off to sleep. I quickly discovered this isn't the book to be used for that purpose. Only 17 pages into the novel and I'd already had a half dozen laugh out loud moments,  so I put it aside to wait until I could really enjoy the experience.  I mean, this guy can write! Next day, I could hardly wait to get finished with things to the point where I could allow myself to sit down with Robin Sloan's delightful book. And then, of course, I had to keep reading until I was finished. No way was I going to set that down again...not for any reason.  Mystical, magical, amusing.  This author's humor slides in like a dude on a Segway, quiet and unexpected, and then vanishes again - you have to wonder if this author not only naturally writes with a sly hilarity sprinkled  about, but perhaps speaks amusing as well. We all know someone who makes you laugh without even trying when you talk to them. I think that might be the case with Robin Sloan. I can't wait for his next book.  Anyway, all this and more you're going to discover  between the covers of this book. And if you are a person who loves techie stuff, you're going to want to dive right into this one. It's like a geek's Harry Potterish type book.  But don't make the mistake of thinking you need to be a techie or anything close in order to like this novel.  I'm not. And I did.  You'll enjoy it even if the only thing you know about the world of Google is that you type in a word and hopefully find an answer....like a tech world dictionary for dummies . Do I recommend this one? Oh, absolutely I do!
B003M6EQR2|5.0|Not much I can say, great show great cast, great story lines, if your a fan of Bones or looking for something new to watch can't go wrong with Bones..
B006PFC2FA|5.0|We played the DVD and loved it.  As we remembered this movie, it was originally in black and white, but in color it is really special.  By way of our title, we do live in an assisted living facility called Brigadoon.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Very good for a relaxing and time consuming has some challengeing levels. Great for all age gamers. Would reccomend to anyone to relaxe with.
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|This is an excellent set of DVDs. They were delivered way faster than I expected, and the quality was superior to any blu-ray I've had. So worth the money. Thanks!!
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Wow... Just Wow.<br /><br />There is no way I can do this book justice on the fly, so I'm going to have to re-visit and re-group on my review. BUT... if I could, I would steal stars from other books and give it to this one. It was that good. The heroine, while still in high school seemed much more mature (which I really liked) but still had her 'schoolgirl' moments to keep everything 'real'. I bawled my eyes out (in a good way)... it absolutely touched me.<br /><br />You likely won't be able to tell from my reading dates, because I did read the first few pages, but then had to squeeze in a book before it was due... but basically I read this in one day. Despite having been ill, and tired, and needing sleep, and having to work the next day- all that took a backseat to finishing this book. Luckily just after midnight I finished.<br /><br />I will say I'm a little worried about book two. While I loved this book, and am not opposed to seeing more from Will and Lake... I want them to have a HEA. In this book, you can kind of assume that is what happens. But with a book 2 comes 'drama' and most likely 'problems' and I just want Will and Lake to be happy.<br /><br />I will be revising this review... I wish I could make it all snazzy and 'slam' it... but I fear I'm not that talented. Okay... time to bite to bullet and try my hand at a slam...<br /><br />\\"Touched\\"<br /><br />Have you been touched by words?<br />Have a hand reach through the pages<br />cause you rages<br />Eyes swimming in tears<br />\\"No, they can't\\" is my fear<br /><br />Affected<br />Afflicted<br />Moved<br /><br />By words<br />Words on a page<br />Pages of a book<br /><br />Fiction replaces reality<br />Teachers become students<br />Pupils jaded no longer<br />eyes wide open to life<br />not death<br /><br />Keep your sympathy<br />Bring down the walls<br />tear out the pages<br />and use them to repair my heart.<br /><br />Okay... I'm so not a poet; I won't quit my day job. But seriously... read the book.It's disturbing in the best possible way. It's like Dead Poets Society without the ... no, wait, there is still a tear-jerking ending. Okay, no more comparisons- just read the darn thing!
B005K17RU0|4.0|It works well on the kindle.  It is easy to use and personalize.  The menus are well done but a better symbol for the locations menu would be nice.  That isn't a big problem because you learn it easily anyway.
0823023494|4.0|I've grown to like Tom Bancroft's books and style of teaching. He has a way of really drawing you into what he's trying to say and gets you involved and interested. Some may see his style as a little too cartoonish but you can't exactly blame him since he worked from many years as an animator for Disney.<br /><br />In this book, Tom Bancroft discusses the importance of adding personality to your characters and giving them life. His focus is to get you thinking from step 1 to plan your character so that when a passer by sees him/her, they can immediately tell what sort of person your character is.<br /><br />Bancroft discusses things such as poses, body shape, expressions and the like for characters of different types including humans (male and female), animals as well as monsters.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to beginners although it can also be helpful for intermediate artists. The only thing I'll add is to say that this book is definitely not a must have. It doesn't have secrets in there that you can't find anywhere else. Having said that though, Tom Bancroft teaches with a rich background and portrays things quite simply encouraging you to try it out as he teaches through.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This card game is really fun. You really need to pay close attention or you will miss a move. Good game.
1402766785|5.0|George Bridgman's illustrations are, at first glance, not as appealing as you'd like. However, as you read his information and try to understand what hes's showing, you start to build an appreciation for his work.<br /><br />In his \\"Complete Guide to Drawing from Life\\", Bridgman takes the human figure step by step explaining the function and shape of every part of the human body.<br /><br />I recommend this book to anyone wanting to understand figure drawing. This book is great for all levels of artists. There is a lot of content in this book.<br /><br />Bridgman dedicated chapters on all the main parts of the body and explains, in detail, the framework behind it.<br /><br />It's good for an absolute beginner to just copy Bridgman's drawings as you'd be training your eye-to-hand coordination on something that is foundational but I'd also recommend that you read every bit of text on the pages. As one person once said about this book, \\"The text isn't just there to fill up empty space\\". Bridgman teaches you things you'll carry on for a long, long time.<br /><br />Definitely worth having in your art library. Highly recommended!
B009KHBDUU|4.0|Great comedic movie. Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter and Michelle Pffeifer are amazing as usual.  You and your family will love this movie.

B00004U2EZ|5.0|Is this the \\"Original Paris Cast, live at the Palais des Congrès\\"...? I am hell-bent on buying the CD for the French musical executed by the original cast; but I don't want the studio recording. I want the live recording at the Palais des Congrès. Can anyone tell me if this is it? And if not, can anyone tell me where can I get it?
B008XG1X18|4.0|I love Pinterest and was frustrated for months at not being able to use Pinterest on my Kindle Fire. This app is great and was a long time coming. There are still some aspects that can be improved upon, but overall this app is just what I've been waiting for.
B0034G4OZE|4.0|Keir Gilchrist, an impressive kid actor of kid movies, had grown up as well as his character-a sixteen year old sex-experimenting pupil who had checked himself into psycho ward to cure from depression with a single pill only.<br /><br />It is surely a deep-meaningful work for viewers M15+, of a kind of such a medicine and a world in and outside the nut house screened.
B00910Y1OQ|3.0|good game really enjoyed it but I made it to the final stage paused the game now I can't reopen it
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I love historical fiction so this book was perfect for me.  What I knew about WWI was the embarrassingly little that we were taught in primary school which wasn't even accurate.  Follett expertly wove the complex political events of England, the Continent, the US, the Russian Revolution & Feminism during that period in a manner that was absorbing, at times suspenseful and in such a way that allowed one to see how each event affected the other. Not an easy task.  I have read the book a 2nd time and it fostered a new interest for me in learning much more about WWI. You will love it!
B007IXWKUK|4.0|This story continues much as the first in the trilogy.  Fifty Shades Darker has a much better story line, held my attention throughout this book. The third book: Fifty Shades Freed, is really good.  It's a must read!
B004YM6JI2|5.0|For anyone who hasn't seen the seventh season of Supernatural--you HAVE to watch this! Sam and Dean just keep on kicking ass and taking names. This series only gets better as it ages! The writers never seem to run out of fresh ideas, the actors never seem to tire of playing their roles to the hilt, and the action and special effects never disappoint. I ordered this collection from Amazon the day before it was released in stores, and I had it within two days, and at a lower price than it was selling for in the stores.
B008TMA1LY|1.0|Very disappointed, my 4 year old granddaughter was playing the game and the next day I see that some how she was able to buy points.  I am sure she didn't do this on purpose...the ability to buy points should be harder to do.  The game prompts you constantly to buy points when you don't need, very confusing for a small child.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|It was absolutely a Great read, couldn't put it down. It was completely addictive. Would recommend it to everyone and wonderful love story also.
B0040QDMBE|4.0|Love the book and how it is set up, the critique of our financial system is razor sharp. But the author does not linger in critique, but rather gives examples of how we can do better.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Great book!  Wonderful characters, plot, writing.  It's intriguing and different and it gets better and better.  I can't wait for more!
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Initially I was worried as it took so long to load.  Another disappointment soon surfaced as I realized that to progress I had to purchase the full game.  I was way too interested; so it was very annoying.  The full version was $1.99 so I thought I'd splurge.  If it had been more I would not have.  I am glad I did.  While there were small glitches on rare occassions;  it was never enough to really bother me and it was like an interactive mystery novel.  Two thumbs up and 5 stars.  Thanks Big Fish games; I am a new fan!
0307474259|5.0|I read this book two months ago on a plane, and it changed my whole understanding of the human body. It also changed my understanding of the strange combination of scolding and guilt that accompanies American efforts to lose weight. By the time I got to the part where Taubes writes [paraphrased] \\"if you starve a squirrel and make him exercise all year, he will still be a tub of lard by the time winter comes,\\" I was utterly convinced. I still eat a fairly carb-rich breakfast of oatmeal, yogurt with jam and fresh fruit, but for the rest of the day I just go for vegetables and proteins. Within the first week I had already lost weight.<br /><br />Now, two months later, I have lost 22 pounds. I have 58 more to go. I am not hungry, my blood pressure has gone down, and I am really satisfied both with the results and with the incredible ease with which all of this is happening. There is no question in my mind that my body is using the fat I've stored for all these years. Also, I was shocked to notice something: Taubes points out that eating carbs makes you sleepy. On the few times when I HAVE had carbs in the afternoon or evening, my whole body seemed to shut down with \\"exhaustion.\\" I had zero energy even though my workday wasn't any more stressful than usual. Now I can see, as clear as day, that it was my physical reaction to insulin that was shutting me down. Wow. I can practically dance up the stairs now with all the energy I'm gaining!<br /><br />NOTE: I would not have followed Taubes' recommendations if he hadn't included the science. That was the clincher for me. I get it now, and I am so grateful for what seems to be a powerful and effective remedy to a lifetime of frustrated eating, dieting, guilt, and low self-esteem.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Just can't play this Cd enough...I had to get another one as the 1st one I bought I played it so much that it jumps, so I'm glad for Amazon!
B008AT71WI|4.0|Let me compare this to the previous version which was on DVD.  This is a new master for Blu-Ray it appears and seems to be sharper than the original DVD without losing a lot of grain (but the picture does seem cleaner to me.)  Having said that, I watched the version with the Director's Cut ending and skipped over the theatrical release cut.<br /><br />There are no new features on this disc other than the alternate ending.  There are no \\"deleted scenes\\", just a gag reel which does however show a brief shot of Rick Moranis in a dream sequence for \\"The Meek Shall Inherit\\", which is about a minute in the film version and runs closer to six in the stage play.<br /><br />It's this cut musical number, I would have loved to see in its entirety as an outtake on the Blu-Ray.  Likely, it was either not found, or they didn't think about it.<br /><br />Now, the alternate ending.  Is it worth the price of the Blu-Ray?<br /><br />Oh yeah!<br /><br />I want to post more about it but I don't want to spoil it for those who don't know, so in a nutshell... if you have seen the original ending on YouTube, you have seen it.  Every shot is used. However, the impact of it in full-color, properly edited, properly-mixed, and with sound effects is far more profound and the movie finally does feel complete.  And unlike the test screening version, it doesn't drag, it feels like it's timed perfectly. Two shots are alternate/altered.  I wish they went a little more intense on the sound effects in the end to make it a bit more horrifying, but this new version stays within its PG-13 confines.  The final shot in New York, especially post 9/11, depresses me still (remember, this was shot 15 years before that) and \\"The End\\"/truly final shot are altered a little bit.<br /><br />I was amused in the credits to see Paul Dooley actually have his credit, and James Belushi under \\"Special Thanks\\", reversing 25 years of history.<br /><br />So yes, I was hoping for that last piece, and it would have been cool to also have the \\"Bad!\\" demo on the disc (see the recent Broadway cast CD for this item) but still worth the money.<br /><br />Thanks, Warner Brothers/Geffen/Frank Oz (and whomever did the restoration work.)
B005HSG3TC|5.0|This case is awesome. I had another case before that was bulky, heavy, and annoying. This case does everything that one did, but a lot better because of it's size. It's lightweight, durable, and thin! It still protects my Kindle Fire and props itself up very well.<br /><br />Awesome case!

0345803485|1.0|Are you kidding me? This is a best seller? A teenager with raging hormones could have done a better job. The book is totally repetitive and unimaginative.  I wanted to throw the book across the room \\"as she bites on her lower lip for the 100th time..... really does she not have any other moves???  It's no more than poorly written trashy romance novel with a few and I emphasize a few sex scenes. What the heck is everyone in such a uproar about?  Just read any romance novel on the market and you will find better written scenes.  Don't waste your money, unless you  want poor writing, a female lead that is uninspiring, plain boring, and worthless sex scenes.  You want \\"porn\\" which this book is being \\"marketed as\\" read Ann Rice - the Sleeping Beuty Series!

B009329ZF2|5.0|This movie was really panned by the critics but it was real good.  In the trailers it looks a lot like a Transformers movie but I think it was better and different than those.
B003Q6D1YW|3.0|I was really excite to see this movie after watching the trailer. A REALLY great teaser. But it didn't really meet expectations. The makers try to say that it's a true story and is being filmed as they go on this journey, but I find that unrealistic. Good story--totally crazy--but honstly, they could've made it more thrilling by just making it a hollywood movie with paid actors. There are big debates up all over the internet as to whether it's real or fake (I'd the overwhelming majority say fake). It's almost just a fail because they're trying to make it more popular by saying it's real. Yet again, it could probably would be better if they just took the Paranormal movie route and not try to claim it as reality. I think it's worth just watching just to make your own decision! Watch it. It's fun, entertaining, and will get you to think, but don't expect too much from it.

B008O9V4C2|4.0|On Donald Fagen's 4th solo release \\"Sunken Condos\\", Donald gives us more solid jazz-rock.  This album brings back memories of the 1980's, Steely Dan's \\"Gaucho\\", and 1982's \\"Nightfly\\", which were both played a bunch during my college years.  Songs of note on this album are, \\"Slinky Thing\\", \\"I'm Not The Same Without You\\", my favorite right now is \\"Weather In My Head\\", Issac Hayes' \\"Out Of The Ghetto\\" and \\"Planet d'Rhonda\\".  A very strong release by Mr. Fagen.

0307472841|1.0|An unwelcome departure from Mankell's usual tale of a depressed detective. This time he gives us a back story worthy of A. Conan Doyle, polemics in the style of Ayn Rand, and an irritatingly smug and annoying post-menopausal protagonist.
0802473628|5.0|I used to be skeptical of books like this but if you are in a relationship and thinking about reading this book, do it! There is not relationship too good not to benefit from this book. Read it together with your significant other, I promise you will find out something new about them, and I almost guarantee you will find out something new about how you are loved. Everybody loves and feels love differently and until you read this book, you may never know that you could be happier with your significant other.

B003VANOFY|5.0|To begin with, the battery life so far is great, even when you've been using them for 5+ hrs. and it starts to get low you get an audible warning (Useful when you're walking around the house on a VoIP call - good signal through my 2 bed 2 bath apartment) even then they still work just the same WHILE plugged into the charging port (Feels like a normal corded USB headset then) while the base brings the start of the cord to the desktop (or where-ever you like) I haven't had any software conflicts as of yet including in-app VoIP and 3rd party VoIP. As for the quality the sound is definitely immersive with the over-the-ear cups and picks up the subtle details (I have heard tone's in songs I've listened to for years I haven't heard before) As for VoIP quality works better than any phone I've had (Granted I have a high-speed connection so I don't have latency issues, which effect VoIP quality but the hardware definitely isn't getting in the way) Overall pleased with the purchase; Quality, Comfortable, Practical and Efficient.
B0091REZMW|3.0|so far so good not used it long enough to really know how I like it yet.<br />I guess to post this review I have to keep typing...
B0013O123Q|2.0|Some people like the artistic elements in this movie, some don't. I don't think it's very innovative to constantly spin the camera or to have the film in reversed sequence...seen that all before. Surely, it's technically well done but also makes it kind of exhausting to watch.<br />What bothers me most is the story: I have nothing about very explicit movies, but there needs to be a reason for that. Just showing how wrong and bad people can be is not deep, it's nothing new... and this is the biggest problem I had with this movie: it tries to be really deep and unraveling, but the story really isn't. Nothing I learned, and since baise-moi rape scenes are (for the better or worse) not that surprising anymore.<br />Monica Belluci plays well, I'd have loved to see here as a character with more complexity.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|completely useless. do not even bother. in fact, Facebook mobile altogether sucks. I don't want to write anymore but I have to in order to review.
0525952926|4.0|Ken Follett's WINTER OF THE WORLD is the epic 2nd book in the 3-part series of the 20th century that began with THE FALL OF GIANTS. Follett is one of my favorite authors, and all of the qualities that led me to love Follett are in this novel. The novel begins with the rise of the Nazis in early 1930s Germany and ends with the USSR getting the bomb and the Berlin airlift. The first book in the series introduced a gazillion characters.<br /><br />This book includes most of those characters, now older, but also includes their children, who are young and growing into positions of power and influence that will affect the history of the world. I found it hard to keep track of them at times, but the character list in the front helps.<br />Follett is a highly predictable writers when it comes to his characters. He excels in describing the class system of past eras, and his simplistic writing about love, romance, and sex can be endearing. Of course, characters' names change, but the templates are almost always the same. But, if you like Follett, you feel comfort in that. By the end of this book, most of the couples had children who will probably play a major role in the next book.<br /><br />After a while, some of Follett's biases get old. Every hero seems to be a socialist or pro-union sympathizer. It isn't that big a deal, because during the time period he is writing about, socialism and unionism hadn't been proven to be the economic failure that it is today. I'm going to quote some examples of where Follett lets his personal opinions get in the way of the story.<br /><br />In one instance, a character in the 1940s says it would be horrible if his parents find out he was gay. The character replies that that would be better than being a Republican.<br /><br />A character alking about World War II: \\"The war wasn't won by the free market and capitalist enterprise. It was people working together and sharing the burdens, everybody doing his bit. That's socialism!\\"<br /><br />Two characters go t an art exhibition called \\"Negro Art.\\" Follett writes the exhibit \\"had been attacked by conservative writers who said there was no such thing as Negro art.\\"<br /><br />Those are just examples of how Follett writes what he knows. The truth is, people really thought like that back then. But Follett pains with such a broad brush that people are either idealistic, noble socialists, or barbaric, senseless conservatives, when the truth is certainly in the middle.<br /><br />The best part of this book was relieving history through these characters, and I can't wait for the final book in the trilogy. However, since this novel is about true events, the characters suffer. They are forces by time and real events to do certain things, and therefore we miss vast periods of their lives. But, Follett is a master, and succeeds where other novelists would have failed.o characters go t an art exhibition called \\"Negro Art.\\" Follett writes the exhibit \\"had been attacked by conservative writers who said there was no such thing as Negro art.\\"<br /><br />Those are just examples of how Follett writes what he knows.

Other than that small dislike we love it and would buy it again!
0553801473|2.0|Gods be good.  Has George R.R. Martin descended into some Sisyphean hell where he is forever condemned to pen a saga he has come to detest?  Apparently wearied of Westeros, he appears to pine instead for persianesque climes.  But, unlike the One Thousand and One Nights, these 1016 pages are unlikely to beguile either king or commoner.<br />Even before this volume, Martin evidences a slipping of the literary leash.  Not only does his continued killing off of important characters often feel arbitrary and capricious, but the methodical physical and psychological maiming of the remaining protagonists cripples the story itself.  Deaths and devastating injuries should be significant in fiction.  They should propel a plot in an importantly different direction.  So far, this has not happened in A Song of Ice and Fire.  There have been numerous opportunities for such an occurrence, but then a central figure is dispatched, and the particular narrative falters.<br />By A Dance With Dragons, some of the original POV/subplots should be merging.  Instead, they are wafting farther apart and are being weakened in entanglements with dozens of new personages and precipitous plot swings.  At times, by fits and starts, the story seems to be morphing into a decidedly different tale.  But, then, such digressions prove to be mere dalliances as Martin purges his yarn of one more character with whom he has apparently become bored.  It makes a reader want to bite her lip in despair.  For Martin's writing style is just as bold and true as ever.  His descriptions are finely drawn and deliberate and his dialogue as crisp and engaging as in A Game of Thrones.<br />Hardcore fans are bound to engage this book, even if they have to endure legions of new characters, whether nameless wildlings or non-Westerosi with non-memorable monikers.  Such fans will do so simply to revel in the further (mis)adventures of Tyrion, Jon, Cersei, Dany, et alia.<br />After all, Winds of Winter is coming.

B008VMTZ3W|5.0|It seems that the reviewers of this album either love it or hate it.  What's new?  I will say that songs 1-7 are as strong as anything in their catalog.  With each Killers LP, I always have a core of favorite tracks, and the rest of the music slowly grows on me.  This album is no different in that regard.  My wife [not a die-hard Killers fan like myself] is of the opinion that \\"Runaways\\" is the best track the Killers have ever done, period.  That debate is for a different forum.  However, I believe it speaks volumes that the Killers are still cranking out fresh music that, while remaining true to their sound, continues to evolve and mature, same as the members of the band.  (Remember-they are people just like everyone else!)  This is a solid album.  If you are looking for a sample to begin with, download \\"Flesh and Bone,\\" \\"Runaways,\\" \\"A Matter of Time,\\" and \\"Miss Atomic Bomb.\\"

B000NQRE9Q|5.0|I got the DVD set of the original \\"Indiana Jones Trilogy\\" back in '04, and it looked great on my old 1080i rear-projection TV.  Once I got a 1080p LED, it was really disappointing. No longer.  \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\\" has received the \\"Godfather Treatment\\", the restoration process that made Coppola's mafia family masterpiece look like brand-new.  I haven't watched the other movies in this set, although I understand they didn't undergo the same process, I'm expecting them to look pretty good, too.  At first I was a little annoyed that I would be getting the double-dip on \\"Crystal Skull\\", since that was the first Blu Ray I had ever purchased, \\"Raiders\\" makes it all worth it.

1451696191|5.0|Before reading The Perks of Being a Wallflower, I always thought that good writing had to be complex, use \\"big\\" words, and be challenging to read, in the literal sense. This book has really changed my perspective on that matter. Perks is a simply written book, made from a series of letters that the main character, Charlie, sends to an anonymous person. The brilliance of this book lies in its simplicity. The development and self-discovery of the characters was very impacting. I am not sure how to properly review it, because nothing I say will do it justice. The characters feel real. The story feels genuine. And just like Charlie, I knew this book was very good, because when I was done reading it, I felt different. And I feel infinite.

B008XBCJ34|2.0|after holding out on releasing the 3-D Blu-ray we are finally given a basic copy without any extras. This movie is three years old and the reason why 3-D movies are popular in the first place. If you are a proud owner of a 3-D television you understand how important this film is. The fact that after three years we are given only a stripped-down version is ridiculous. Especially when a full extended cut will be made available in a few months. It would be one thing if they were releasing this version of the film alongside a special edition for budget consumers. Instead they're trying to trick us into buying this version by saying it's a limited edition. If you really want to save a few dollars just by this addition at the half price used DVD store in a few months when people return it. We all know they are going to release a full 3-D version with the extended cut and the extra features eventually. After all this is the guy that re-released the Titanic in 3-D.

0316228532|2.0|This was a hard read.  The book is well written in a very British sort of way, but the story line is brutal on just about every level.  I came close to giving up several times but in the end I muscled through mostly because of few moments of a television interview with J.K. I happened to see, I believe on the Today show.  The interviewer said he cried at the end.  I wanted to read that ending.  I did mist up there but I'm not sure it was the story that did it.  I simply may have been relieved it was over.  Depressing hardly describes the entire work.  I'd really love to know what J.K. was thinking as she wrote this book.  I read all the Harry Potter books and loved them.  There are plenty of dark moments in HP but The Casual Vacancy left me exhausted and completely cold.  If it was the only book I'd read by J.K. I would never read another.  It's that demoralizing of a story.  If you're looking to be sad and depressed this book will fulfill that wish.  Otherwise read something else.
B008BD9SI8|2.0|before i start i want to make it clear that the last argument of kings is one of my favorite books. one of the greatest i have ever read. so i am a huge Abercrombie fan.<br /><br />But...<br />i really feel i missed out by not seeing things through \\"lambs\\" eyes. he was a huge part of the pull of before they are hanged and i was disappointed by that.<br />i did get to understand him through the eyes of the others and he was a major part of the story but there was something very different and quite special about the way Abercrombie wrote his alter egos viewpoint, its missing in this book.<br />i always find it hard to connect with any female viewpoint so no surprise that i cared little for shy, temple i cannot identify with ether. there are minor characters and some other viewpoints but as these two where the main and i felt little for either i was disappointed there. i felt like i read the book mainly to see what would happen with \\"lamb\\" and to some degree savian/glama golden.<br />really i guess i like powerful, ruthless males with a fairly violent story. gloticka and logan from the last argument where my favorites and there ideally would have been more of a focus in that direction (for me anyway).<br />i'm sad to see the world looks like its moving into the steam age. this is isn't great mainly because guns are pretty boring to read about vs. swords and axes. its not there yet but it looks like the next book may feature some flintlocks or something, especially as Abercrombie keeps aging his characters/bringing in new ones and new tec so that the world seems to be moving forward.<br />the storyline is good but i feel that Abercrombie is a little carried away with depressing endings and people going back to being \\"bad\\" after an attempt at elevating themselves. its a recurring theme throughout all his books and is starting to become a little repetitive. especially without such interesting action scenes to keep me hooked. its not as strongly portrayed as in best servedcold tho. which is a little depressing to be honest.<br />despite that the book is enjoyable and slots somewhere in between the heros (which was better), and best served cold (which wasn't). it doesn't rise to the level of the first law series..<br /><br />overall id say its a good book. above average. below what i had hoped for.

I never bought anything from AC DC and thought, where are the ballads??  The fact is this is a new set of songs from a pretty good band.  The album is fine, it's what made Green Day who they are.  Fast songs that just sound good.  Yes there last two albums seem to have more depth, but it was nice to hear some old new Green Day again.

Maybe all the little things that bothered me in this book will make sense after I read the next book in the trilogy.<br /><br />Normally when I like a book (especially one that's part of a trilogy or series) I will read it then re-read it over and over until I start the next book (I read Bared to You twice), but I don't want to read this book again.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|This is a match three game similar to many online games. As a matter of fact, the game play is the same as the web version.<br />Match three, bonuses for matching four, powerups, the whole nine yards.<br />The good part, is the graphics translate well to the small screen.<br />Got as faod, but I might have even paid for it.
B008IYR2BA|5.0|Dexter traveled with us to Hawaii and back - definitely made the flight faster and more enjoyable.  Loved the new caracters and very interested to see what happens in the final season.  It is difficult to review and not want to give the plot or ending away to whomever has yet to watch.  We do not subscribe to Showtime and waiting that long to see it will be agonizing, but I love not having to wait a whole week between episodes, either.
B005LAJ22Q|3.0|The series itself is flawless and amazing but I was disappointed when I put the first DVD in and it started skipping right away new out of the box.  I am only giving this product 3 stars because walking dead is awesome and the other DVDs worked but other than that I was really disappointed.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Move over Christian, there is a new man in my fantasies!!  For any fan of \\"Shades\\", the Crossfire novels are for you - better written, with more character depth and complexity.  Looking forward to reading the conclusion to Gideon and Eva's story in the 3rd installment - what a way to ring in the New Year!!
B0098VXE50|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  Lots of excitement keeping me on the edge of my seat. Charlize Theron as the evil Queen? Wow. She played it well.  I don't usually watch movies a second time, but this is one of those that you just don't get bored with.
B004GGTAQE|5.0|I read this book when I was stationed near the Pakistan border in Afghanistan, which gave me some appreciation of the experience of dealing with snipers and artillery barrages, though nothing like the extent the author had to deal with. After reading this I was much more thankful of all the luxuries the current army has compared to the struggle in WW2.<br />  I must say after reading about the intense struggle of Otto Carius and his comrades in the 502nd Schwere Panzer Abteilung on the Eastern Front, I had a better understanding of the extreme misery (such as having to drink water out of puddles) and also extraordinary courage of the soldiers on the front, and that is where this book truly shines. From the description of Feldmarschall Model to the description of \\"Old Man\\" Biermann the loyal mess sergeant. This is a front line soldier's view, and the detail of life on the front is covered very well. The bravery and comradeship is wrote of often, including commentaries by the author on duty and honor which I found to be accurate, but also lacking from a lot of other books covering armored warfare on the Eastern Front. The tank on tank combat is not overly detailed but paints a clear enough picture of how things happened.<br />  I would highly recommend this book to any platoon sergeant, platoon leader, or company commander. Especially were the author stresses the importance of good battle drills, preparedness at the front and coordination between armor and infantry. There are lessons to learn for contemporary commanders here, as well as a lot of information for any World War 2 buff. This is not to be missed by anyone studdying the sociology of the soldiers of the time.
B002BI6SMI|5.0|This movie was really good. Action was not over the top. Despite the \\"old spy/solider/cop gets back into the action to save his family\\" theme, it was very original.

0547564651|5.0|The book material is phenomenal. I would recommend the book to anyone interested in this area, and even to those who are not. HOWEVER, if you are bothered by irritating voices and voice inflections DO NOT GET THE AUDIO VERSION. The man who reads it is not the author, and I'm sure he is a lovely man, but he makes a fantastic book painful to listen to. Firstly, he is obviously not familiar with the substance of the words he is reading. He doesn't stumble across words, but he reads the book in an overly cheerful(?) way that gives his voice a goofy nature, (almost as if he is reading a bedtime story to children), which is completely disparate to the interesting, often troubling & not humorous subject matter. It is very irritating, distracting and seems almost condescending. The second, utterly obnoxious, and maddening feature of his reading is that when he reads quotes in the book, he imitates the voice of the speaker. So far, most of these have been women. Not only does he raise his voice to imitate femininity, but he talks with more voice inflections at the end of sentences, and terrible attempts at accents I'm sure he believes to be from \\"the hood\\". This awful imitation of imaginary people, comes off as insulting mimicry; it sounds as if he is making fun of them. In short, please READ the book. Don't listen to Dan so-and-so read it. Also, one of the books Paul Tough mentions, Why Zebras Don't Get Ulcers is also fantastic, although packed with more bio/endocrinology than this book, if you're interested in toxic stress & how it affects the body's functioning, this is right up your alley. And Sapolsky is hilarious, as well as a great writer.

If you are into beautiful, different, magical sounds then get this. Download it, listen to it, buy the cd, steal it from a friend, whatever. HIGHLY recommend!

You no longer need to pass the USB 3.0 cables through the case and plug into rear USB 3.0 motherboard ports.  Ensure your motherboard has two 20-pin USB 3.0 headers.<br /><br />I would also note that the larger video cards will require removal of the upper HD bay.

B00336C3EY|4.0|The jaundiced or cynical film buff first blows off this story as an overly developed,  cultural slice of life with an  insider's look at the American Orthodox Jewish family.  But, that's only the smoke and mirrors.  Stepping from event to event, scene to ho-hum scene,  through his day while trying to make sense out of apparently  bad events, he moves from a family man trying to do the right thing, not get snared morally when confronted with a student bribe, as he allows events to impact him without taking any action besides hand wringing.  At this point, you change position in your chair and think about recycling the DVD to the local second hand shop.  Hang on.  Like 99% of all plots,  the protagonist is taken to a new land as he becomes a serious man, then a wretchedly serious man and then?  As you hit \\"stop\\" on the remote, and wonder why you bought the movie, you realize that it was an Everyman film.....about you and your life.  The only difference was the setting and props.  ( Helpful would be to read Thornton Wilder's definition about the purpose of life.)
B003O86FMW|4.0|I enjoyed the book. i cant wait to read the next one. love the details and the imagination put into this book.
B001EC2J20|4.0|\\"The Matrix Reloaded\\" is often considered an example of a \\"bad\\" sequel, but I must disagree. The things that are bad about this sequel are awful, yes, but the things that it does well are fantastic.<br /><br />PLOT:<br /><br />The story they came up with is the perfect continuation of \\"The Matrix.\\"  It explores the world introduced in the first movie, while adding new twists.  Neo, having come to terms with his role as The One and formed a relationship with Trinity, is now working towards figuring out how he must save the human race, and whether his relationship with Trinity can survive this.  We learn more about the Oracle, and the world of the machines and their programs in the Matrix; they have their own society, filled with individuals with personal motives, some of whom want to help the humans and others who are just self-serving.  We finally see Zion, and how the freed humans live.  All of these things are woven together in a story of Neo racing to figure out his role in the Prophecy, as the Machines drill closer and closer to Zion.<br /><br />The downsides of the story are pointless sex scenes (like the notorious \\"orgy scene,\\" and the \\"cake rape\\") and drawn-out philosophical babblings about \\"purpose\\" and \\"choice.\\"<br /><br />CHARACTERS:<br /><br />One of the strongest points of this movie. The villain, Smith, is brought back in a way that's clever and believable (for this series anyway).  New characters are as good or better than ones form the first movie.  We get to meet other humans in the resistance, as well as other Programs who are not in league with the Machines.  Many fill roles of characters who died in the first movie, but are still fresh and new at the same time (Link is the new wisecracking operative to replace Tank; Niobe is the new secondary-female-fighter-with-cool-hair, to replace Switch; Smith-controlled-Bane is the new double-agent to replace Cypher; etc.)  The Merovingian and his wife Persephone are two fun antiheroes with ambiguous agendas.  We also meet the Architect, and although a lot of his dialogue is confusing and pointless, he's one of the most iconic characters in the series.  The only character I disliked was Kid, who was obviously supposed to replace Mouse as the cute naïve youngster, but instead was annoying, and anything but \\"cute.\\"<br /><br />ACTION SCENES:<br /><br />Fun and cleverly choreographed, but too drawn out.  The opening scene is classic, starting in a way that pays homage to the first movie, with Trinity coming in and kicking ass.<br /><br />VISUALS:<br /><br />This is both one of the best and worst things about this sequel.<br /><br />The CGI is god-awful.  When Neo fights multiple Smiths in one scene, it literally looks like a video game.  The movie also has some dreadful uses of green-screen.  Most of the sex scenes are gross and idiotic, rather than romantic or sexy.  There is one romantic love scene between Neo and Trinity, but it is interrupted by scenes of a bizarre orgy that the rest of the humans are engaged in; later, we see in great detail the effects of eating orgasmic cake.<br /><br />The scenery and stylish looks of the characters compensates.  If you liked seeing the different Matrix outfits and hairstyles of Morpheus's crew in the first movie, then you'll love the Crisis Meeting scene in \\"Reloaded,\\" were we see multiple crews of humans in the Matrix, as well as all of the sharply-dressed programs Neo and friends meet throughout the movie.  The shots of the underground city Zion are very cool looking, and in the Matrix, characters are lead through a maze of strange rooms and locations.<br /><br />MUSIC:<br /><br />A +.  I own the soundtrack, and it's one of my favorite things to listen to.  If you like techno or \\"cyberpunk\\"-like music, you should love it.<br /><br />DIALOGUE/ACTING:<br /><br />Not fantastic, but not horrible. The dialogue, like the action scenes, gets far too drawn out and pointless at times. But there are also some great lines as well. (\\"Trinity, we're talking less than five minutes.\\" \\"In five minutes I'll tear that whole goddamn building apart.\\")<br /><br />OVERALL:<br /><br />They wasted the potential to make a fully fantastic sequel. With some editing, they could have made the story flow much better, and gotten rid of some pointless scenes. But as it is, \\"The Matrix Reloaded\\" is still entertaining and interesting.y, we're talking less than five minutes.\\" \\"In five minutes I'll tear that whole goddamn building apart.\\")<br /><br />OVERALL:<br /><br />They wasted the potential to make a fully fantastic sequel. With some editing, they could have made the story flow much better, and gotten rid of some pointless scenes. But as it is, \\"The Matrix Reloaded\\" is still entertaining and interesting.

B00338QENI|5.0|This was a book selected by a member of my book club. And so far, I consider it the best book I've read all year. It's a facinating and well-written story that tells the tale of the intersection of Western medicine with a poor black family, illuminating the ignorance and beauty of both. At turns, also horrifying and terribly sad, it gives you a lot to think about in terms of how far we've come, and still have to go. -It also goes well with The Emporer of All Maladies, if you have an interest in the biography of medicine, and cancer in particular.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|This book sets the tone for a much darker series than the Percy Jackson saga. Fans will love the way things from the Percy Jackson books are nestled into this story, but it is totally possible to read this book separate from the Percy Saga! I literally squealed at the end and demanded the next book because of the possibilities I see opening up.

B004GCPJDQ|1.0|The product was great for about the first a month.  Then it started shutting off in the middle of use.  I went to their website and followed their recommendations and still same result.  So I opened a support ticket. I've open 3-4 support tickets because after their initial response with questions and asking for pictures I never hear from anyone again.  So I open a new support ticket, referencing the same older tickets, get the same response asking for photos and to check the angle of the battery connector.  If I could give this product a 0 I would.  Save yourself any aggravation and don't buy any product from Mobee tech.
0316228532|4.0|The Casual Vacancy is painful, beautiful, uncomfortable, dark, funny; but mostly it's honest. Rowling's gorgeous prose is familiar to Harry Potter readers, and her storytelling is as masterful as ever in The Casual Vacancy.<br /><br />I think if you enjoy works by Jonathan Franzen, Ian McEwan, Stieg Larsson, and Jeffrey Eugenides, then maybe you'll also enjoy this book. The characters are flawed in the most candid and raw ways imaginable; characters so realistic that the reader can put a face (yet different name) to each of them. It's not difficult to relate to the villains and heroes, which might explain why some readers do not like the book.<br /><br />No, it's not Harry Potter, and readers should not expect it to be. But it is brilliant.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|Really good puzzle game. Not to challenging and definately not to easy either. Definately worth a look if you are into a game that just plain kills time with ease.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|This story tells of how one struggles with poverty, loss and love.  The story follows a young girl who has had to take the head of the house after her father passes away.  She makes the ultimate sacrifice for little sister, and faces death only to end up questioning love and living with guilt.  Not a bad story, a little dark, but not bad.
B0000524CY|1.0|For decades, I avoided watching \\"the scariest movie ever made\\" because of all the hype promoting this film as such. Obviously, for me and everyone else who WASN'T scared to death, this was an enormous letdown. I really expected to be traumatized to the point of needing therapy based on the reviews; at the least, cover my face while screaming or forever sleep with the lights on. While this movie had plenty of graphic language and visuals, it wasn't scary as much as gross and profane. Of course, one doesn't expect Satan to play nice and whisper sweet nothings, but the focus on excessive vulgarity rather than truly frightening elements was ridiculous and gratuitous. Satan manifests as a perverse sadist with a filthy mouth more than a horrifying entity. The script was weak and the acting poor. I actually laughed when the possessed Regan grabbed the priest's crotch during the exorcism. While the transformation of a young girl into an ugly & evil being was bizarre, a horror movie has to be more than extreme makeup and gore to freak me out. Unknown and unseen evil trumps over-the-top special effects. In fifty years, I've yet to experience a single spinning head, blood-thirsty vampire, zombie invasion, demon possession or paranormal activity. But I've heard odd noises, driven down desolate roads, passed creepy abandoned buildings and seen strange people, all of which were eerie. I know, it's only entertainment and opinions/tastes can be highly subjective. While many think this movie is the #1 ultimate horror film, for me it didn't live up to it's reputation. Vulgar and gross, yes. Utterly terrifying? A resounding NO!

B009JBWOU0|5.0|We are in a golden age of comic book movies right now. No movies show that as perfectly as Christopher Nolan's \\"Dark Knight Trilogy\\" -- three movies that explore the formative years of the legendary superhero Batman, from the beginning of his crusade for justice to the explosive climax. Even people who aren't into capes and tights can appreciate this story.<br /><br />\\"Batman Begins\\": After his parents' murderer is paroled, young bazillionaire Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) vanishes on an aimless journey across the world. He's taken under the wing of the mysterious Henri Ducard (Liam Neeson), who offers to train him to be a member of the League of Shadows. But then Bruce learns that the League plans to annihilate Gotham, his home city.<br /><br />Gotham has become rotten to the core with mobs, crooked cops and a fear-inducing shrink. Using the company's discarded prototypes, Bruce fashions an armored bodysuit and tanklike vehicle, and uses them to fight crime wherever he finds it. But the League still has plans to destroy Gotham, and the only one who can stop them is Batman.<br /><br />\\"The Dark Knight\\" is feeling pretty good about his battle against crime, especially since the new DA Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) is a morally-upright good-guy. But Batman isn't prepared for the Joker (Heath Ledger) a mad clownish psychopath who has hired himself out to the mob to destroy their worst enemy, the Dark Knight. Even worse, he has the ultimate way of blackmailing Batman into doing what he wants: holding all of Gotham hostage.<br /><br />\\"The Dark Knight rises picks up eight years later -- crime is almost gone, Batman has vanished, and Bruce Wayne is a recluse. But then a terrifying masked man named Bane arrives in Gotham, attacking Batman as revenge for the League's destruction. He will turn Gotham into a living nightmare, unless the Dark Knight can rise again...<br /><br />Most directors would have given these movie a distinctly comic-book, slick pop-culture feel. But no matter how hard you search, there's not a single hint in \\"The Dark Knight Trilogy\\" that anything kitschy or campy came before it, or that it was originally a comic book. Instead Christopher Nolan creates a movie as dark, tightly-wound and intense as Batman himself.<br /><br />But since this is a comic-book movie, Nolan peppers them with kinetic action, high-speed chases and massive explosions. The dialogue is drizzled with dry humor (\\"That isn't exactly what I had in mind when I said I wanted to inspire people\\",\\" Batman says, looking at a bunch of impersonators), mostly to temper the overhanging sense of horror and apprehension.<br /><br />The most striking part of these movies is Nolan's delving into morality, and the darker side of human nature. He heaps more tragedy and trauma on Batman than just his parents' death, and delicately traces the moral boundaries -- or lack of them -- between Batman and his foes.<br /><br />Christian Bale is simply brilliant as Bruce Wayne/Batman -- sure, his growly voice can get a bit silly at times, but he perfectly conveys the strength, pain and determination of a man who will sacrifice everything to save others. Michael Caine is awesome as his faithful butler/father figure, and there are solid backing performances by Morgan Freeman and Gary Oldman.<br /><br />And the performances of the villain actors are absolutely brilliant. Everybody knows of the late Heath Ledger's spellbindingly chilling performance as the Joker, a casually corrosive creature who believes himself to be the yin to Batman's yang. But Tom Hardy and Liam Neeson are also brilliant as cunning, clever people who are determined to destroy Gotham.<br /><br />The biggest problem is that Nolan isn't very good at casting women. Maggie Gyllenhaal and the pouty Katie Holmes are both hideously miscast as the cruel, manipulative Rachel Dawes, who treats Bruce's heart like a toy. Anne Hathaway is the best of the bunch -- a pretty baffling choice as Catwoman, but she does a decent job.<br /><br />\\"The Dark Knight Trilogy\\" contains some of the best superhero movies ever made -- a dark, gritty, richly-imagined tale of one man's quest against chaos and evil.t job.<br /><br />\\"The Dark Knight Trilogy\\" contains some of the best superhero movies ever made -- a dark, gritty, richly-imagined tale of one man's quest against chaos and evil.

B00260HH3K|1.0|Disclaimer: I am not a fan of Dragonball, Dragonball Z, or any other things having to do with Dragonballs. No hate, just not a fan.<br /><br />So when I saw \\"Dragonball: Evolution,\\" all I knew about the series was what I gleaned from wikis and Abridged Series... and I STILL found plenty to mock and criticize. This movie is an incoherent mess with no real motivations or plot -- fans will be frothing at the mouth at the stuff it changes, and non-fans will be completely baffled.<br /><br />On his eighteenth birthday, high-school outcast/martial artist Goku (Justin Chatwin) is given a magical Dragonball by his grandfather Gohan (Randall Duk Kim). But when he returns home from a party, Goku finds that Gohan has been murdered by the evil demon Piccolo (James Marsters), who is trying to gather all the Dragonballs so he can... do something.<br /><br />Like any good Obi-Wan, Gohan's dying message is to find somebody to finish Goku's training. So Goku joins forces with the eccentric Master Roshi (Chow-Yun Fat), along with the Dragonball-obsessed Bulma Briefs (Emmy Rossum) and desert bandit Yamcha (Joon Park). This little group must gather all the Dragonballs before the eclipse, or Piccolo will... do something.<br /><br />\\"Dragonball Evolution\\" is a great example of why live adaptations of anime don't turn out well -- not faithful enough to satisfy Dragonball fans, but too esoteric for newcomers. But even if that weren't true, the movie would still be a mess -- it feels like nobody cared enough to do more than slap everything hastily together.<br /><br />Almost nothing is explained (like Piccolo's motives). Instead it just coasts along, hoping that the splashes of CGI and wacky acting will distract you from the incoherent plot. And in a futile attempt to appeal to teenagers, it inserts random High School Wangst, in a baffling subplot that has Goku being bullied and mooning after Chi-Chi.<br /><br />I'd also like to mention that it has several characters that have no reason to be in this movie except... well, that they existed in the manga. Ernie Hudson, Emmy Rossum, Joon Park and Jamie Chung all do decent jobs, but they are utterly wasted.<br /><br />And the actors who AREN'T superfluous are totally wasted too. Chow Yun-fat acts like he's gone off his bipolar meds, although there's a certain hammy charm in his performance. And Poor James Marsters is stuck in green makeup, with no motivation except \\"Piccolo's evil! And he wants the Dragonballs for... uh... no reason!\\"<br /><br />And Chatwin? The less said about him, the better. He's your typical pouting teen loser who Doesn't Fit In, which makes him an awful lead character.<br /><br />\\"Dragonball Evolution\\" is a prime example of why Hollywood should stay far, far away from anime and manga -- a baffling, annoying slagheap that won't make anyone happy.be in this movie except... well, that they existed in the manga. Ernie Hudson, Emmy Rossum, Joon Park and Jamie Chung all do decent jobs, but they are utterly wasted.<br /><br />And the actors who AREN'T superfluous are totally wasted too.

And Poor James Marsters is stuck in green makeup, with no motivation except \\"Piccolo's evil! And he wants the Dragonballs for... uh... no reason!\\"<br /><br />And Chatwin? The less said about him, the better. He's your typical pouting teen loser who Doesn't Fit In, which makes him an awful lead character.<br /><br />\\"Dragonball Evolution\\" is a prime example of why Hollywood should stay far, far away from anime and manga -- a baffling, annoying slagheap that won't make anyone happy.
B008AWBQGM|5.0|Johnny, Rickey and the boys have launched another Rock and Roll Classic.  This album Takes the last album ... God & Guns one step further. It weaves touching tales about the hard times and misfortunes suffered by the common man.  It also looks back at how life should be.  I am a staunch Skynyrd fan and take to heart every lyric on this gem. If you haven't heard any of the tunes give it a listen.  You'll definitely want to add this one to your collection.

1440503257|5.0|Why I love this cookbook:<br />#1 I love the whole world of Harry Potter, Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Hogsmeade Village with the candy store of all candy stores, Honeydukes.<br />#2  I love cookbook design, writing, reading recipes as well as eating and sharing the resulting recipes from various cookbooks.<br />So, you can see why I was already inclined to give the \\"Unofficial Harry Potter Cookbook\\" 5 Stars.<br />The author and compiler, Dinah Bucholz, has done an excellent job of collecting recipes for all of the foods, drinks,  and sweets mentioned in the seven-book, Harry Potter series. She has written the recipes clearly and the ingredients lists match the order of preparation.<br />Of the 25 or so recipes that I've made so far, all are at least good tasting; most came out really well and were hits at tea time parties with friends. Some ingredients or dishes probably are popular in British boarding schools, but not in our U.S. house.<br /><br />At the very beginning the author makes it clear that certain foods or dishes will not appeal to everyone. The Steak and Kidney Pie or even Steak and Kidney Pudding, and Tripe with Onions come to my mind and right off my menus. But these are very minor complaints. There are hearty stews, savory supper pies and casseroles, variations on mashed potatoes, and other main course fillers that hold the book together while diners can focus on dessert by enjoying all the many pastries and sweets. It seems these Hogwarts/HoneyDuke's/Weasley treats make up about 3/4 of the recipes in the book. Perfect ratio and just what any Harry Potter fan would expect in a complete cookbook.<br />Dinah Bucholz has written the recipes for all of us including child cooks. Some recipes need adult supervision and she warns the cook about those.<br /><br />Another wonderful thing about \\"The Unofficial Harry Potter Cookbook\\" in addition to the recipes and variety of foods authentic to the original Harry Potter series, is that the page style and design look like the cookbook has been taken right off a shelf for purchase at Flourish and Blotts (or at Amazon.com, in this case). Every recipe has a small parchment illustration with additional information from the books. The introduction to the recipes tells where they originate in the series. The pages themselves look like they have been printed on very old sheets of parchment.<br />All in all this is a practical book to use, read, and treasure.yle and design look like the cookbook has been taken right off a shelf for purchase at Flourish and Blotts (or at Amazon.com, in this case).

0062101897|5.0|My first 5 star Amazon review. I stumbled across this for my Potter-obsessed daughter last Christmas. It was by far the best loved gift (even surpassing the shared trampoline gift for the family). She literally had it open every day for nearly 2 months and still opens it regularly 10 months later. The detail is phenomenal, pictures and 'behind the scenes' are a wonderful addition to the books/movies. Highly recommended for your Potter fan who has read/seen the books and movies.

B000002MIY|5.0|I bought Kamakiriad the day it was released in May 1993.  I was all of 12.5 years old and hit the roof with excitement because this was the first new release from the SD/DF/WB camp since I'd become a devotee.  I listened to it exhaustively for nine straight months soaking up the textures, narrative, performances, harmony, production, arrangements, vocal performances, ad libs, etc.  Donald always gives the listener a lot to ponder and explore.  It remained a fixture in my listening list from childhood to adolescence to adulthood.  New revelations were made about Kamakiriad (and every release from the SD camp) at every stage of my life and as a result I've come to love it more and more while being bewildered at how Donald (and Walter) do it all.<br /><br />Admittedly, I have not listened to Kamakiriad much within the past 5 years.  I had ear fatigue on it from listening to exhaustively for years on end.  Experiencing (and loving) Donald's lastest release \\"Sunken Condos\\" compelled me to revisit Kama and today I love it more than I ever did.  I marvel at how well it has aged these 19 years.  It seems more poignant, intelligent, sexy, mellifluous, introspective, innovative and classy than ever.  A lot of so-called artists are touted geniuses, but for Donald Fagen that is NOT mere manipulative hyperbole.<br /><br />I feel privileged to have discovered SD/DF/WB at an early age.  Their music made an indelible mark on me from the beginning.  If you're tired of the trite, banal, repetitive, soulless, poorly written and executed garbage that passes for music today, I invite you to visit the Steely Dan/Donald Fagen/Walter Becker-verse. These guys do EVERYTHING perfectly:  music, lyrics, narrative, composition, vocals, arrangements, solos, production, engineering, etc. It just may leave an indelible mark on you as well.

B00992CF6W|5.0|When I first saw this in the amazon store, the only thing my mind had thought of was &quot;NO WAY&quot;. I have minecraft on my Windows XP. It is very slow and laggy. 10 fps. But as SOON as I saw this app, even with its price, I went and got a $25 gift card just to get this (I have no credit card) . I only played this for 5 minutes. It is dangerously addictive. So additive,  I played this for 2 hours, thinking that only ten minutes had passed. The crafting system is easy. So is the furnace. If you are new to this game,  GET IT. Its awesome.  I was suprised it ran so well. I play this app more than the PC version. It is the best app I've ever played. Not only that, but you can play multiplayer EVEN with an ios user, over local wifi. Its possible to put mods, yes. But why lag it? just play it as it is. And if you can't for some reason, download it, I'm sorry, I really dont know what to tell you other than contacting amazon . You will be satisfied. Its worth 7 dollars.  GOING ON TO 4 SHARED IS ILLEGAL. YOU WILL BE A PIRATE. DON'T BE EVIL. PAY THE GOOD MAN WORKING ON IT. AND YES 7 DOLLARS IS DEFINITELY WORTH IT.

0783231202|5.0|Using clips from this movie in both my AP US, and Honors US history classes gives students an in-your-face version of the plight of African slaves on board the ship during the Atlantic crossing. Also exellent for debating the sectionalist views prior to the US Civil War- Dred Scott decision (slaves are property), as well as the governments refusal to address the problem in the courts. (US Declaration of Independence failed to mention slavery as well as the US Constitution in fear of Southern secession). Excellent cast, beautifully directed. A MUST see.
B0007TKNII|5.0|this movie is soooooooo good.  Great actors wonderful music, great singing, suspense, romance, danger, excitement, it has it all. I would recommend this to all. A trip back in time, but so much part of our future.

B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I'm not one for young adult books.  This book was amazing! The author finds a way to bring out multiple emotions ranging from anger, surprise, love, frustration, and excitement.  Just as Travis seems to be addicted to Abby, their relationship kept me wanting more. The development of the characters is refreshing. I felt like I knew each one of them intimately.  I look forward to the sequel and reading from Travis' perspective! Why this book was not originally picked up by a publisher is baffling. This is definitely one of the better book I have read lately!
B008M0NDOK|5.0|I used to be a pretty hardcore gamer on my old playstation, but it's been several years since I've played on a gaming console and I've been toying around with the idea of getting a Playstation or XBox because I do like to play games every now and again. But when I found out that there was a controller for games on the iPad, I was sold! Now I can play legit games on my iPad without having to invest in a full gaming console and all the various games. Downloading the apps and using the controller and dock is so much easier. Plus I can take it on trips with me, which I love. This is getting me back into gaming which I'm really excited about. :)

0425263908|1.0|I read \\"Bared to You\\" by Sylvia Day because I read a review that said if you are trying to find a good book to read after you've read \\"50 Shades of Grey,\\" this is the book you want. It said this book was much better than the 50 Shades trilogy.<br /><br />Just goes to show you, you can't believe everything you read. Who wrote that review - Sylvia Day? It was the biggest rip-off I've ever come across. Ana and Christian was a beautiful love story - with or without the sex scenes; Eva and Gideon were poor - very poor - substitutes - with or without the sex scenes. Day followed 50 Shades so closely that you knew what was coming on every page - so much so that I asked myself why someone would think this was a better book.<br /><br />The fact that the book was placed with the same display as 50 Shades obviously helped sell copies. I'm still shadking my head over how bad it was. My suggestion - don't waste your time or your money. Do what I did - re-read 50 Shades.
B009MFKO3M|5.0|The reviews I have read seem to focus on the shift in sound from the first album to this one. I don't hear that (a shift in the sound).<br /><br />I *do* hear a far stronger set of songs. As always, the songs are the thing.<br /><br />I am totally enjoying this album. Top flight indie pop.<br /><br />*****Highly recommended*****
B008KGWWL6|5.0|This 14-CD set contains 15-plus hours of Maurice Ravel's works (omitting only the pieces he wrote for the 1900 & 1905 Rome Prize Competitions). The recordings are all top-notch and drawn for the most part from the Decca and DG catalogs. Universal Classics is fairly spoiled for choice when it comes to this composer, and it's interesting to see what was included in the set and what was not.<br /><br />The solo and 4-hand piano works occupy the first three discs, with the solo works split pretty evenly between Decca recordings by Jean-Yves Thibaudet, and DG recordings by Ivo Pogerelich (his awe-inspiring reading of \\"Gaspard de la nuit\\"), Martha Argerich and Pierre-Laurent Aimard. The 4-handed works are played by the Kontarskys, Pascal & Denise-Françoise Rog&eacute; and Vladimir & Vovka Ashkenazy, with Ravel's own two-piano version of Debussy's \\"Trois Nocturnes\\" played by Anne Shasby & Richard McMahon (you'll need to provide your own women's chorus for \\"Sir&egrave;nes.\\") Decca has gone for recommended recordings here, using the arguably top recordings available to them in the Universal catalog. Sound is generally sumptuous (though the included Jacques F&eacute;vrier recordings of \\"Habanera\\" and \\"Entre cloches\\" are a bit closely miked).<br /><br />The bulk of the orchestral works are represented by Charles Dutoit's outstanding survey with the Montreal Symphony that was recorded by Decca at the start of the digital era. The Daphnis & Chloe from this set has been a top recommendation since its release, and it comes up well here in the latest mastering (1999?) by Decca. The CD features 12 tracks, a much better situation than the single track encoded on the CD when it was initially released.<br /><br />The mantra of going for the best recording available extends to the choice of opera recordings as well: \\"L'enfant et les Sortil&egrave;ges,\\" which is the long-admired 1961 DG recording, and \\"L'Heure espagnole,\\" also from DG and recorded in 1965. Both works are conducted by Lorin Maazel. While I find this choice logical from the standpoint of including recommended recordings, I find it unadventurous and frustrating from the point of availability. These Maazel recordings are still available in fine, remastered sound in a DG Originals 2-CD set that also features substantial fill ups  (I assume the DG Originals mastering is the mastering used for CDs 12 & 13 of this set). One would think that most collectors already own these recordings in that DG Originals release, or in their initial single-CD releases.<br /><br />The frustration comes from the fact that Decca has two \\"house\\" recordings of \\"L'enfant\\" that they could have opted for instead: the 1954 stereo version by Ansermet and the later digital recording by Charles Dutoit (which was only given wide distribution in the USA when I released it under license through MHS. Dutoit's recording received rave reviews when it was released in 1995). Both of these recordings are hard to come by in the CD market these days, while the Maazel is readily available. Maybe I'm wrong, but I would think the target market for this 14-CD set isn't the casual listener looking to fill a \\"composer gap\\" in one fell swoop - let alone the novice looking for the most-expensive way possible to secure a copy of \\"Bolero\\"! -, but the avid collector, who is taking advantage of the completeness of this set to plug a few gaps in their existing collection. I'm not saying Decca should have included Ansermet's mono account of \\"L'Heure,\\" but I think they could have included Dutoit's \\"L'enfant\\" and earned the admiration of collectors, even though the Maazel still wins on points in the overall scheme of things.<br /><br />To add to the frustration, Decca also had the option of including the digital recordings of both operas made by DG in the late 90s and conducted by Andr&eacute; Previn. Though I would still give pride of place to Maazel, the Previn discs - which were well received by critics - can be hard to find, and their inclusion would have been a gesture to collectors who already own the fine Maazel versions.<br /><br />As vast as are Universal's Ravel holdings, there are gaps when it comes to some of Ravel's esoterica. Those gaps have been plugged by licensing recordings from EMI (CD 14 - \\"Myrrah,\\"  \\"Alcyone\\" & \\"Alyssa,\\" conducted by Michel Plasson. These are the pieces Ravel submitted for Prix de Rome consideration in 1901, 1902 & 1903, respectively) and Naxos/HNH (various songs). Here, the choices come down to pretty much the ones included in this set, though some of the more-popular songs where choice was available are entrusted to well-known artists like Gerard Souzay (Don Quichotte), Felicity Palmer and Cecila Bartoli.<br /><br />A 182-page perfect-bound booklet is enclosed that includes all of the sung texts in the original language (French, Hebrew) with English translations (thank you, Decca!). The CDs are individually housed in sturdy cardboard sleeves from which they exit easily, while the outside clam box is extremely sturdy and laminated, with a spine width of only 1-3/4\\" that saves quite a bit of room on the shelf. Excellent packaging.<br /><br />A wonderful edition at a very reasonable price!usion would have been a gesture to collectors who already own the fine Maazel versions.<br /><br />As vast as are Universal's Ravel holdings, there are gaps when it comes to some of Ravel's esoterica.

0451450523|5.0|The Last Unicorn is one of my all-time favorite books, for several reasons:<br /><br />1. The prose. The first line is a perfect example of the beautiful language woven throughout the story: \\"The unicorn lived in a lilac wood, and she lived all alone.\\" The language, for the most part, is simple, but it's that simplicity that builds the atmosphere of magic that the story relies on to work. And it works.<br /><br />There are some places where the language doesn't always flow, such as apparent anachronisms like the one scene where prince reads a magazine, and they really threw me out of the story, but rest of the book more than makes up for these occasional stumbles that may not be stumbles at all. The time period The Last Unicorn takes place in is never defined, and so those apparent anachronisms may not be anachronisms at all but the result of expectations built by the countless other fantasy books I've read.<br /><br />2. The themes. None of the characters in the book are perfect, except perhaps the unicorn, but even she does not escape the evils or the beauties of the world unscathed or unchanged. Jealousy exists alongside wonder, hatred parallels love, despair is made all the darker for hope... One of the things The Last Unicorn does that few other books do is frame a world where the darker side of emotions are real and tangible, and yet show that the world and the people within it are beautiful. Whether the beauty arises from the contrast between the darkness and the light, or whether the darkness itself is a source of beauty, the beauty is /there/, echoing between the lines of every page, even in the darkest moments.<br /><br />3. The unicorn. Unicorns are an embodiment of unchanging perfection, and yet, the unicorn of this book /changes/. I suppose this ties into the themes point I mentioned above, but the unicorn as a character loses sight of who and what she is, learns how to live without such self-knowledge, and then has to come to terms with what has becomeof her and what she has become. I can't really say much more without spoiling anything, but the loss she feels as a result is particularly poignant, and it's this sense of loss coupled with the language that really haunt me with their beauty.<br /><br />The Last Unicorn isn't really a story in the sense that characters go out and do things, even though that happens; and it isn't so much a quest story, even though a quest initially drives the unicorn to leave her home; but it /is/ a story in the sense that characters grow (or don't) and change (or don't) and /learn/ in doing so.<br /><br />The way I see it, The Last Unicorn is ultimately a story about life and how people go through it, beautifully told through the eyes of a unicorn. For that alone, it's worth reading.

How anyone could rate Sharp Objects below 4 stars is beyond me. I would like to know<br />what books those people consider GOOD so I could cross those off my too read list. Gillian Flynn has<br />moved to the top of my favorite authors list and I look forward to her next book.
B0044LYRG4|5.0|An adorable show! My almost 5 year old son loves it and I do too because there isnt anything questionable in it. Just a little girl and her friends dressing up and going on imagination adventures.
B0058DRSHW|5.0|Jim Collins is a prolific researcher, writer, and teacher of enduring great companies. He graduated from Stanford University with degrees in business administration and mathematical sciences. He also used to research and teach at the Stanford Graduate School of Business. Jerry I. Porras is the Lane Professor of Organizational Behavior, Emeritus, at the Stanford Graduate School of Business. Like Collins, he is also interested in the characteristics of visionary companies, especially focusing in on the organizational components. He received his BSEE from Texas Western College, his MBA from Cornell University, and his Ph.D from the University of California.<br /><br />The authors have two primary objectives: to develop a conceptual framework based on the common dynamics and characteristics of highly visionary companies, and to effectively communicate these concepts so that they are useful to others (Location 459). In doing this, they discovered that all visionary companies have a core ideology, an unrelenting drive for progress, and an organizational structure to preserve the core and stimulate progress (Location 4974). The specific methods that companies use to implement those requirements may change and are the topics in part two of the book.<br /><br />This book is separated into three sections. Chapters one to four outline the research questions and underlying principles for the book: be a clock builder, embrace the \\"Genius of the AND,\\" preserve the core and stimulate progress, and seek consistent alignment (Location 4993). Chapters five to nine describe specific methods that visionary companies used to preserve the core and stimulate progress, while not claiming to be the only methods that work: Big hairy audacious goals, a cult-like culture, trying a lot of stuff and keeping what works, home-grown management, and that good enough never is. Chapters ten to the epilogue summarizes the book and separates the major concepts from the minor ones.<br /><br />This book is definitely a must-read for all leaders and managers, whether you are in the non-profit or for-profit spheres. I give this book a 5 out of 5.s definitely a must-read for all leaders and managers, whether you are in the non-profit or for-profit spheres. I give this book a 5 out of 5.
B009B50QOU|4.0|The songs on this album seem to fit in somewhere between the older Green Day albums, i.e. \\"Dookie\\", and the newer releases like \\"21st Century Breakdown\\".  To me, it's a welcome return to a more lighthearted, punk feel.  I'm looking forward to the next two releases and hope they continue to follow along in the same vein.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Can't get enough... Always checking for new ideas on crafts&hellip;cooking, and fashion! Love how it takes u back to the original Post., so helpful!
B00992CF6W|4.0|I love it but there is a bug in it when i go to put coal in the furnace and it wont let mr any help?
B0014D6PCO|4.0|Love the story, love the choice of casts. Would definitely watch this movie multiple times. I did not think of wanting to collect the Batman series but after watching the whole 3 movies, I would like to have them as our family's private movie collection.
B0053O89WY|5.0|I love The Big Bang Theory i enjoyed all the seasons and even season six that just started. I can honestly say i like to watch the episodes over and over and still laugh each time. They are all so amusing and great entertainers If your into the big bang theory too you got to get season 5 and if you dont have other seasons they are worth getting and watching trust me this is something for the entire family to watch. Great Job on this show hope alots more seasons to come.

B0045HCJKS|3.0|What Michael Crichton's Westworld has going for it is a fairly high-budget production for 1973 and kind of a surreal feeling just by the nature of the story.  It drips 70s.  And I like it for that.  On the other hand, you could criticize it for being fairly predictable once you know the premise of the story.  It belongs in the same category of entertainment as say \\"Planet of the Apes\\" or \\"Logan's Run\\".  By today's standard of 'riveting' it falls a bit short, but as a period piece from an age when even video tapes hadn't come out it yet, it carries a pretty solid cinematic vibe and even existentialist undertones that reflect the era.  Or maybe that's reading too much into it.  As a distant precursor to Jurassic Park, you can see Michael Crichton thought a lot about theme parks going awry.  The dinosaurs in this movie however are all androids.  As a period piece it may be worth a look.  On the other hand, a younger audience may find it lacking in the thrills or sophistication of better modern movies.  I could understand a 4-star rating for this movie, but 5 is probably pushing it a bit.
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|I couldn't put it down and as always the riddles weren't easy to decipher. Can't wait for the next one!
1401324649|5.0|I got this book as a present and was already intrigued by the title. Once I started to read<br />it I had a hard time to stop (those are the best books). A partly obscure story well written<br />and at times so funny that I had to laugh out loud. Extremely enjoyable!
B009SIZHMG|1.0|Title says it all. No issues with Internet - other devices working - but this stopped three times. Not much else to say.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I thought this was a little better than the first book, Barred to You. This one stepped away from the 'Fifty Shades of Grey', and focused on its own story, with its own striking and exciting mysteries and events. I am so in love with Gideon Cross, and I can not wait to read the third. :)
B00772M1F6|5.0|I was checking out some tunes on Amazon and ran across JD McPherson's Signs and Signifiers. I read a couple of reviews and thought I would give this a try. I must say it is one of the best CD's I have purchased in years. The band and the recording are very good. I would encourage any music lover to grab yourself a copy,and listen to some Rock and Roll at it's best.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Avengers is a great movie.  Full of fast action and a good plot.  It is neat how it ties in to the other movies out there; Ironman, Thor, Captain America, and The Hulk.
B0097GVJWQ|3.0|I haven't played this too much because, it's kinda boring. I'm not sure what I am supposed to be looking for or how to get clues. I found a couple item search things. Maybe I'm just not doing something right. I will keep trying and see what happens. I have noticed on a lot of the reviews that people are having problems downloading it to Kindle fire. I had no problems loading it. Although, I did have to wait til I had a good internet signal. I have had to call amazon once or twice with other apps and they were very helpful (even after I had said some harsh words about an app)thanks amazon.
B004UUKDNA|5.0|This is the first album that I have ever heard in my entire life that I liked from the first time listening to it.  It delivers exactly what you expect after hearing the hit \\"Pumped Up Kicks\\".  The lyrics are deep, hidden, and intuitive if that makes sense but indeed they are thought provoking which puts me at ease in terms of the kind of subliminal message I get from the music I listen to.  I love the album  I really feel like I am rocking out without over doing it!  Meaning it's not club time 24/7 but it's always Rock oUt time which is the vibe this album delivers!<br />Ok I had to put an update after researching the lyrics to some of the songs.  They are pretty dark and twisted.  Its best if you don't listen too closely lol  but its still a fun album haha so much for subliminal messages.
B001D2AYCI|4.0|Added this to my growing surround sound collection (something around 75 discs now).  Some of the reviews had me hoping to hear a mostly different album - but there were only about 3 times that I felt I was hearing something that wasn't included in the stereo mixes.  Most of the surround effects had Tony's small fills in different channels.  Ozzy's vocals seemed muted on War Pigs - but okay otherwise.<br /><br />Still a must have for anyone wanting to cover the originals of metal.  A new surround mix of the first album would be even better!!
1439152802|5.0|First Line: Rural England, a farmhouse in the middle of nowhere, a summer's day at the start of the nineteen sixties.<br /><br />Of course most teenage girls would think any farmhouse in the country is the middle of nowhere, and sixteen-year-old Laurel Nicolson is no exception. Playing hooky from a sibling's birthday party, she's daydreaming of her future up in the tree house. A little later she sees a strange man walking up the road to the house where he speaks to Laurel's mother.<br /><br />Fifty years later, Laurel is an award-winning actress who's gathered with her sisters at the family farm to celebrate their mother's ninetieth birthday. Their mother has always been beautiful, vivacious, loving, almost perfect in her children's eyes, but her health is fading quickly. Laurel realizes that she's had questions about that long ago day when she saw the stranger walking up the road-- and she's running out of time to get the answers she wants because the information Laurel needs can only be found in her mother's past.<br /><br />Dorothy Nicolson's memory seems as fragile as her health, but even on her good days, she's unwilling to part with any information. Laurel must dig for clues, check records, and talk to Dorothy's contemporaries. Reliving her mother's life as a paid companion in London during the Blitz, Laurel slowly begins to put the pieces together and discovers the stunning truth.<br /><br />I have read and enjoyed all of Kate Morton's books; each one is better than the last. In her latest, there are many secret keepers-- it seems as though each character has something to hide. The narrative moves between present-day England where Laurel searches into her mother's past, and London during the 1940s where as a young girl her mother tries to survive despite endless shortages and nightly bombing raids. Laurel soon finds that her mother's story is entwined with those of two others: rich, beautiful Vivien married to a successful novelist, and handsome war photographer Jimmy.<br /><br />Morton is masterful at revealing facts in increments-- clues a tiny nugget at a time. While the reader may get the impression that the characters' feelings, histories and motivations are becoming clearer with each chapter, are they? Really? Or is the reader merely seeing what Morton wishes them to see? Morton's talent is that she does both at the same time.<br /><br />One thing that Morton does wish the reader to see is that each decision made by Dorothy, Vivien and Jimmy has its consequences, and that each decision may not have been the right one. As each character comes under closer scrutiny, the reader's loyalties may shift from one to the other until the very end where all is revealed.<br /><br />Did I place any of the puzzle pieces in the proper positions? A few, but not many. I've learned in reading Kate Morton's books that it's best to pretend I'm going whitewater rafting. There are quiet pools, strong currents, electrifying rapids, and a sense of near euphoria by story's end. Do what I did: sit back and enjoy a wonderful ride filled with vivid, memorable characters.her Jimmy.<br /><br />Morton is masterful at revealing facts in increments-- clues a tiny nugget at a time.

B009FZZFME|5.0|As a person who's read all 103 comic issues of the Walking Dead, this season should be one of the most memorable and intense seasons.  I can't wait to see if they stick close to, or deviate from the comics.  The Prison/Governor issues are some of the most intense and thrilling in the Walking Dead series.  If they follow the comic for the most part, get ready for some crazy stuff.  Season premier was awesome.
0307592731|5.0|I love this book and I would recommend it to just about anyone.  Cheryl Strayed has a gift of writing that puts the reader right there with her. I have laughed out loud at several places in the book \\"moose, moose, moose!\\" that would be what I would have done when she saw the bull.  I feel her pain but I also feel her find herself and grow stronger each day.  This book shows what we all have inside us and yet it gets lost sometimes. We have inner strength that we do not know we have. Cheryl just never knew enough in the beginning to say \\"I can't\\".  She just went for it.  If she had analyzed it too deeply she could have made a list why it wasn't possible to set out to do what she succeeded in doing. Great book, entertaining yet motivating. This is definitely one of my all time favorite books!
B007KZY1YY|5.0|I haven't read a book in almost four years so when the 50 shades of grey books came out, I wanted to see what all the fuss was about.  I loved them so much that I'm reading them again for the second time. This is the first time in my life that I'm reading books for a second time and here it is I'm reading all three for a second time.<br /><br />Love Love Love them.<br /><br />SR
B001I45UFC|5.0|\\"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\\" illustrates the great sacrifice of Jesus Christ in assuming our penalty for our sins.  Even though fanciful, it becomes a very moving account of giving of one's self for the benefit of others.  C.S Lewis is a master author in the Christian faith.
B008ER9QLK|5.0|I could get to the Met NY from Australia by flying to LA, waiting for a connecting flight to NY, become stressed to the max by several airport security systems  . . . taking about 42 hours from home to NY and arriving frazzled, disheveled and stressed,  OR I could buy this set of DVD's, sit back in my favourite chair and watch the clearest picture, most wonderful sound as if I were in the best seat in the house.  Guess which one I chose?
B004YM6JK0|5.0|I love this series and have the whole collection so far. This box-set is better that previous season 5 and 6 with more extras including more deleted scenes, which have been missing from previous sets. Well worth buying.
B008KP6ENE|1.0|I've been trying to download this game for the past 4 days, i already bought it but when i click the download button, nothing happens. I felt like i paid to get nothing in return.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I have loved this series since the very beginning, and Riordan does not disappoint in his latest, Mark of Athena. I might be a little biased, but this story has an amazing plot, tons of action, and more romance woooo! This is a great read I would recommend to anyone.
B006LSZECO|1.0|Why would one care about a man who is too stupid to pull his feet out of the mud and then too lazy to pull when the opportunity arose? I know no one who liked this book. But no one.
140131046X|3.0|The beginning was alright.<br />The middle dragged on for too long.<br />The ending was the best part.<br />Then I went to youtube and watched some clips<br />of Henry Covington.  That was nice.<br />But, just like \\"Tuesdays with Morrie\\", , ,this is<br />a book about someone's last days.

B0054JZC6E|4.0|Very addicting and fun to play. Highly recommend for kindle fire. Games are not too easy and not too hard.
B000FCK65W|4.0|Written in the third person, this certainly is Francie's story.  The reader gets drawn into the poverty culture of the immigrants of Brooklyn during the years prior to WWI.  The characteristics of the tree matches the strengths of the women especially Francie, her mother, Aunts and grandmother. It is a well written story, although perhaps a bit sterotypical.  A story of courage and determination.  A good read.
B000HF0ILY|5.0|i bought 2 dvds from this store and i received them fairly quick, despite being deployed to Iraq, where i work.  the quality of the dvds were very good.  i am completely satisfied with my purchase.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|The game is a great idea and a lot of the games are fun, but it is really hard to unlock new games. It has taken me over a week to get to where I am, which is the second page.I would suggest getting this game if you have a lot of free time.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|The book was a great final read. the final book was a good end to this triology . must read
B0083H6AQA|3.0|In Paris, 1890, a penniless young man (Robert Pattinson) is befriended by three married women and quickly becomes the stud muffin du jour.  He acquires money and power but learns being a boy toy can be complicated.<br /><br />Based on a story by Guy de Maupassant, this rags-to-riches tale has lavish sets and costumes and beautiful photography.  The three female leads (Kristin Scott Thomas, Christina Ricci, Uma Thurmon) are outstanding.  The same cannot be said for Pattinson, however; his character is  neither handsome nor appealing and so the story falls flat.  Also, his dialogue, which deals with emotionally-charged subjects like love and hate and loyalty and betrayal, is stoically-delivered with an unflinching poker-face.  He doesn't have the charisma required to make his role believable.<br /><br />If you are a fan of Robert Pattinson, you'll enjoy the movie, but to me, he's still in teen vampire mode.  My take:  3 stars.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|There were far too many people involved and too many new locations to be realistic. He is a great x military man but not that great. It was rather long and he is not a super man all the time
B000FC1AOI|5.0|This book is amazing !! it is sweet and cute and youll never want to put it down it is very unpredictable. i wish the ending went a little different but deffinatly one of my favorite books to cute !
B005O64VH8|5.0|First of all let me just say I'm elated to find out that my favorite band out there is still active. It's been a very long time since a full new album came out (Inside I'm Singing reused many old melodies). And just like every Secret Garden album I've bought: once you hit play and the music flows out, and takes away your breath, your soul, until you find yourself back in the real world with a heart filled of wonder, because you realise something so beautiful and amazing is real. Now I don't think this album is as perfect as some early ones like White Stone or Song from a Secret Garden. But it's at least a tie with Dawn of A New Century. I feel this album is unique because it sounds extremely hopeful. First 3 songs instantly makes me believe life is good. There are a few very sad songs as well but I think the overtone of this album is very positive. Anyway I was moved to tears (of pure joy!) because it's been so long since a full new album. And I had a huge smile on my face that lingers for a while after listening to the whole album.

B008RTE09S|4.0|I admit, the first time I watched \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\" I could not even sit through the entire thing. The second time I was a little more impressed but still thought it was a terrible film. The third time, however, while listening to Paul McCartney's commentary was much more enjoyable. It made me understand the film much better. It is not just an \\"acid trip\\" movie like people assume. And watching it in high-definition makes the experience much greater. I am pretty impressed with restoration. Though it is not as perfect as the restored version of \\"Yellow Submarine\\" it appears as though Apple still knows what they're doing. And most importantly, the movie is not cropped to widescreen. It is in its original aspect ratio, which was not done in the Blu-ray version of \\"A Hard Day's Night\\" (I refuse to buy it for that reason).<br /><br />Some of the film's best moments are of course the music videos. If you watch it for no other reason just watch it for this. Especially \\"The Fool on the Hill\\", \\"I am the Walrus\\" and \\"Your Mother Should Know\\". Another great scene is of the Bonzo Dog Doo Dah Band singing \\"Death Cab for Cutie\\". The singer's voice and movements are hilarious. Besides the music videos it is the best part of the movie.<br /><br />The special features are wonderful as well. Though I was disappointed because I thought The Ed Sullivan Show version of \\"Hello Goodbye\\" was going to be included. But Paul McCartney's commentary and the making of featurette make up for it. Paul even mentions the \\"Paul is Dead\\" rumor at the end of the film. More importantly, he goes on to say that they loved to give clues to fans to mess around with them. And we finally know who the walrus is; Paul and John both trade costumes throughout the music video. Anyone who still believes the \\"Paul is Dead\\" conspiracy is a complete idiot. I once was skeptical about it, but once you learn as much as I have about The Beatles you realize it is impossible for it to be true.<br /><br />\\"Magical Mystery Tour\\" is far from your conventional film. I find great charm in this and am glad I purchased the Blu-ray. I am not into artsy films to be honest, but if it's The Beatles it feels different. They were so talented at everything they took on it is hard to not love everything they have done. I really hope to see a restored version of \\"Help!\\" on Blu-ray in the near future.<br /><br />Video: 4/5<br />Audio: 4/5<br />Special Features: 4/5<br />Overall Rating: 4/5y Tour\\" is far from your conventional film.

B008O9V4C2|5.0|Unless the last 2 songs are abyssmal I must rave about this while I'm listening for the first time...Sunken Condos will never get a second chance to make a first impression, and the first impression it's making so far is just perfect...it's almost like DF has been studying his own style and boiling it down to 45minutes of brand new music...I am very impressed...buy it

The characters are almost real, you can literally feel how their perspective of the games was! I know lots of people hate the Hunger games, but I don't, give The Hunger Games a chance and while you're at it give Catching Fire and Mockingjay one too.You should read the hunger games

030758836X|5.0|This is not a murder mystery (which I don't read!) -- it's a very twisted story of a very twisted couple and what they will do to each other. Great depth of character development -- you'll find yourself rooting for each of them at times, and then hating the very thoughts in their heads. Totally unpredictable plot twists -- such a treat in today's world of rather templated writing. Read this book!

B004QDCZ3M|5.0|A friend sent me a link to YouTube to hear Florence & the Machine and once I saw that I had to watch many of the videos.<br />At 59 I am probably not her hottest market age but I love her music.<br />That day I ordered \\"Lungs\\" and her second CD at the same time.<br />I got the bonus edition so I could get as many of her song as are released.<br />Fantastic flow of music.<br />I can't understand what the lyrics are so I looked on-line to read them.<br />Strange... but nothing objectionable to me.<br />she isn't singing about blowing up the world or killing your neighbors...<br /><br />I play her music on shuffle & repeat all day long while working and it keeps me going!<br />Two thumbs up and all

B00932AA5G|3.0|I only wanted to see this film because of Nikolaj Coster-Waldau. Most of the film was focused on Roger Brown, played by Aksel Hennie. It's a testament to his performance and the action sequences in the film that I was on the edge of my seat the entire time. This film is also genre busting in a way because the focus of the film is more on relationships than the sex and violence. Roger Brown has a really wonderful character arc. I felt one way about him at the beginning of the film and by the end I really wow... did a total 180 just because he grows so much through his experience. The plot keeps you guessing. Unpredictable.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game I like the update also also if you see the leaderboard I'm like the third or 4th one I &lt;3 this game
B009NBZGVA|4.0|This is a brilliant novel, although I have discovered that my brain is certainly not measuring up to the task of comprehending its entire plot. I will need to do further research into its analysis. Listening on an Ipod constricted my ability to go back and reread. Some words were, therefore, incomprehensible.<br />There are six separate enormously imaginative stories that intertwine throughout, some more gruesome than others, each a study in some kind of hopelessness or failure of society to achieve its ultimate goals, some of which are heinous. Each of the characters is connected in some way, a birthmark, a friend, a lover, a movie, a diary, a letter. Each of the stories takes place in a different time frame. Each story is begun and then the reader is left adrift as another begins. However, the thread of each story is picked up and connected to the one previous as it is worked forward in time. Without warning, the stories actually begin again, and this time, they work backward in time to the ultimate conclusion which seemed to me to be the hopelessness of hope.<br />I thought the major theme was that the drive for power, for control over someone weaker, remains throughout history, far into the future, as the brutality that the human being is capable of, comes full circle, with the stronger still overcoming the weaker, enslaving them and justifying any means to get to the end they pursue. It is dystopian, even as the effort continues to create Utopia. Civilization does not seem to make much progress except for the improving technology, and in the end, that technology is what ultimately brings about its downfall. One of the characters, Louisa Rey, is told by her father that you have to lie sometimes, to get to the truth. It seems like an oxymoron, but it is the core of the tale because contradictions coexist with each other, and more often than not, they are not harmonious or successful. Oftentimes, the truth is dangerous.<br />The opening sentence is poetic and I anticipated more of the same, but the tale grew a bit confusing and therefore more daunting. The story is revealed through the memoirs, lost journals and diaries of the main characters. Each story is in a different venue and is told with a different voice, depending on the country, time frame and personality of the characters. This takes some getting used to, since often, the dialogue is very creative and odd word combinations are used which the reader has to decipher.<br />As we read, we watch the progress, or lack thereof, of civilization from the early 1800's, well into a future that enslaves humanoid clones, programmed for specific jobs and then eventually to a world that is almost beginning anew after a catastrophic event. Civilization thrives and decays, returning to its barbaric beginnings, even with the enormous advances of the scientific world which provided incredibly advanced tools.<br />The characters are flawed, even those high minded in their efforts to achieve their goals. Age old prejudices persist into the future. The Cloud Atlas feels more like a series of novels linked together, or perhaps, a series of connected short stories with a definite Kafkaesque feeling of helplessness to effect an eventual meaningful change.<br />In the closing sentences, a statement is made by one of the first characters we meet, Adam Ewing. He says, when he is being discouraged about the future, that each droplet is part of the ocean...meaning each droplet must truly count, and change will come about little by little. Yet, when you turn the final page, I wonder if you will think that the more things change, the more they remain the same!
B0084I9QI2|5.0|This album really celebrates the 25 anniversary of this album. All of Michael Jackson fans needs to have this. Great quality on the concert And really enjoyable tracks.
0812416503|4.0|I loved this book.  I can see how it would be tough for some people to get through, as it was VERY descriptive and not so thrilling at some parts.  However, I became lost in Manderley.  I felt like I was there, like I too, was jealous of the beautiful Rebecca. I was uptight when Mrs. Danvers was mentioned, and I yearned for Mr. De Winter's touch just as the main character did.  Overall, a beautifully written book that is rightfully a classic.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|enjoyed the game. very addictive. nice journey and a good long game you can play for a while. overall I was pleased.
B0053O89KG|1.0|The DVD was great. It's Castle after all.  However, just returned from the post office £12 the poorer. They didn't tell me I  would have to pay duty on it. Wouldn't have ordered it if I had known. Made it a hefty price to pay even for Castle
B009CPES4I|4.0|Great characters and a movie about real people, real circumstances.  It was a refreshing change from the high tech, high sexed stuff that the theaters are full of.
B008JAGTNK|3.0|Although I very much like the subject matter of this movie, a young strong independent female leading character, the movie is just too long. It drags on about her changing conditions so laboriously that I was finding myself fast forward through parts of it. I remember thinking to myself that most of the things happening to Margaret in the plot I already knew before they happened. The plot was so predictable. Now I really like movies about girls coming of age but this one took itself to seriously. Maybe they were going after a dark character image. I like that to but this movie came across as not dark but more ugly and painful than needed to make it's point. It's a good movie but I would only give it a 6 out of 10
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Objects from ancient Mediterranean cultures form the focus of this match-3 game, with segments where you match the collected objects to their function in the ancient cultures. Interesting. Requires good strategy skills.

B0098VYCCE|1.0|I could write a 20 page essay on everything that's wrong with this movie. But instead, I will just sum it up.  It's terrible. Boring. Pointless. Frustrating.  Don't waste your time with it, just like I'm not wasting my time reviewing it.
B007THA4FI|1.0|Our Book Club selected this book with the high hopes our families have had with the Harry Potter series. Never have I been so disappointed and dismayed. This book, to my surprise, was just one step from being labled porno. With that said, the writing was more of a rambling farce about a small town. The language was more than the usual hard core and the characters were almost impossible to separate or remember from one page to the next. I realize the ratings jumped to the top when her book came out, but what a quick tumble they took with me.

B0052RDHTM|5.0|I started with a preview and was immediately entertained. Bought it. I don't buy many e books but this was one I had to continue to read. The characters are endearing and the set is historic which drew me in. Mixing fact and fiction I was compelled to to read and read. Was hard to put down. Looking forward to many more
0061692042|3.0|I cannot remember the last time I read a novel and kept looking at the top of the page to see how many pages I'd read....and how many were left.  I love densely written novels.  But this one was over the top!  Talk about over-thinking something!  Someone mentioned in an earlier review that Dell, the main character, acted as though he had a frontal lobotomy and I must say I whole-heartedly agree!  I had a very hard time believing his mother would rob a bank, despite the author's very very long reasoning as to why the character would do something this uncharacteristic.  Because this premise didn't seem plausible, the rest of the novel didn't really work for me  .  The main character's passivity was hard to swallow as well.  There were definitely scenes that were beautifully written and evocative of the mood of the place.  Extremely bleak at times.  But I was really happy when it was over!

B005LJKEXS|5.0|I ordered two of these cables as an extension from my monitors to a new server (about 30 feet away in a server room). The cable sheathing is nice and thick but still flexible. The female extension head is a little large if you're running the cable through a wall but otherwise no problems. Great product and I really appreciate the seller's customer support outreach.

B0085Z8F4A|1.0|One word, horrible, that's it. I don't review many movies but this one was a waste of time. I fell asleep during part of the movie. There was no point to the movie.
B003PJ6UHA|4.0|I found this book to have the best descriptions of the changes in the scientific world as a result of Quantum theory and other fairly recent writings that cover the nature of reality.  These two writers cover the material in a way that almost anyone could understand.  These subjects have been described both at length and briefly but I found this writing to be the most complete and imaginative. I have only one complaint, which is a completely unreasonable one, and that is that they refuse to take the information that one more step so many of us are waiting for.  That is that final step off of the cliff of science into the infinite sea of spirituality.
B0079HLDCQ|5.0|Can't get enough of David Baldacci books. Always fast moving and thrilling and The Innocent doesn't disappoint. Can't wait for more. Bought from the Kindle Store straight to my iPad. Too easy!

B008S4FZHI|5.0|Long-time Scarpetta fans will be pleased to see their heroine back to her best.  The Bone Bed is told from Kay's first person point of view, and while there is the occasional hyperactive dialogue that marred so many of the recent Scarpetta stories, we are treated to a gripping and racing plot, strong and affectionate relationships and mysteries surrounding several dead and missing bodies that makes The Bone Bed the best Scarpetta novel in a long time.<br /><br />Scarpetta is convinced several cases are linked together, and is determined to pursue the killer whilst juggling concerns about her relationship to Benton, Marino's latest interest in Twitter and Lucy's mysterious environmental pursuits. Whilst Scarpetta continues to doubt and has paranoia around several of her close relationships, she comes across far stronger and more grounded than she has in the past, and it is revealed that she has every right to trust her instincts. It has been hard to get through some of the previous Scarpetta stories, but The Bone Bed has you staying up late to turn the pages and unravel the layers of mystery and suspicion.  It is reminiscent of many of the earlier books in the series - a real \\"whodunnit\\", rich in forensic detail and full of distrustful characters. Nods to Scarpetta's past are fondly looked upon, and Cornwell once again makes you really care for her characters.<br /><br />It is wonderful to see Patricia Cornwell writing at her best again, and great to be really looking forward to the next Scarpetta novel!

B004SUDQ72|4.0|David Cronenberg is the type of director where you either like one of his films or you hate it. No middle ground really exists which is how he's always been as a filmmaker since Shivers. eXistenZ explores similar themes and concepts to his earlier techno horror masterpiece Videodrome. I suggest people watch Videodrome followed by this film if that want to fully grasp the movie.

B007GCY8FS|4.0|It took a while to start to really enjoy the book but once the ride started it was a good one.
B003AX0X3I|5.0|Once having owned both Cry of Love and Rainbow Bridge before they went out of production (on vinyl)and having lost them in the shuffle of life, finding and hearing this MP3 album brought tears of joy.  The song, Drifting, brought the tears as I remembered hearing the song for the first time in 1971 on Cry of Love and grieving for the life that was snuffed out too young and the loss to the world of the most innovative guitarist of all time.  Some may have faster fingers and some may be more technically proficient but none have ever been as adventurous and creative as Jimi Hendrix was, the man who humbled Eric Clapton and amazed millions with his instrument.  Four times he set one afire on stage literally but hundreds of times he set audiences on fire figuratively.  [[ASIN:B003AX0X3I First Rays Of The New Rising Sun [+Video]]]<br /><br />You'll want the MP3 album with the bonus video tracks.  They help us understand how and what Jimi was doing with his new studio toy and how he was building his concept album.  First Rays of the New Rising Sun was made with the idea of at least getting close to giving us what Jimi was trying to birth.<br /><br />This was Jimi in 1970, making a concept album on his own terms, in his own studio, continuing to explore the musical edges and advancing beyond them.  The genius of Hendrix is on full display as he laid guitar upon guitar, made drum tracks, ran bass through fuzz, and called in a host of great musicians to help him then make the album he'd always wanted to create.  Sadly, he died in England in September of 1970 before he could hurry to his new home in New York, his studio, to finish making the masterpiece.<br /><br />Cry of Love and Rainbow Bridge were released posthumously, parts of a whole, but this album is an attempt to come as close as possible to the album Jimi envisioned, remastered with loving care by some old mates and, as usual, yet another new direction for Hendrix.  Some songs remind you of Eletric Ladyland, some ofAre You Experienced, one song sounds much like the Band of Gypsys and there is one older hand-me-down (my Friend) from a 1968 session included as it had not \\"made the cut\\" on an earlier album and is well worth hearing.  He plays a musical counterpoint to 1983 (A Merman I Should Come To Be), he lays down some Jimi-style blues james, he adds layers like never before - I remember a friend listening to Cry of Love and complaining that it didn't sound \\"Hendrix enough!\\"  Not so.  Jimi would always have blues in his heart but his creative juices kept taking him new places.<br /><br />If only he'd not fallen prey to the drugs and drink!  But here he is at his last and perhaps his best...don't miss it!
B002VECLVO|5.0|Achingly tender - beautifully filmed - pitch perfect performance by Colin Firth - an incredible accomplishment for a first time director.
B0030M3SBI|5.0|The Band of Gypsys may have been an album released by Hendrix to meet contractual obligations, but that does not detract from the raw power and genius of Jimi, live, jamming with a funkier pair of musical partners, Billy Cox and Buddy Miles.  Some say that this was the new direction for Hendrix, but the tracks he produced at Electric Lady Studio belie that claim.  There was no one direction for Jimi Hendrix, he was a musical genius who was a rainbow overshadowing the pallete of \\"types\\" of music.  He was blues, he was rock, he was soul, he was funk, he was electric and experimental and absolutely alive when accompanied by a guitar and a microphone and bandmates to jame with.<br /><br />This is my favorite live album of all time.  Just when Jimi threatens to begin noodling, he changes direction and his talented fellow Gypsys follow suit.  Machine Gun is the unrivaled best version of this song ever done IMO.  No fan of Jimi Hendrix or rock music or great guitarists should be without this album in their collection.  RIP Jimi - but your music continues to pass the bottle even as you have passed on![[ASIN:B004NCOQVA Jimi Hendrix-Band of Gypsys: Live at the Fillmore East]]

0316228532|4.0|Hello,<br />Although I have read 2 of the HP books, I did not open this book eagerly awaiting the next fantasic installment in the world of Harry and Hermione. I did purchase this for my daughter, who is a passionate HP fan, but started reading it myself. Not that I have, I will discourage her to read it - the topics are too mature for her and, quite honestly, will bore her at times, and I won't say any more about the sexual content. You know that already!<br />Now that I have finished the book, I think it is a work of extreme talent and insight. The book is full of rich observations about human life and circumstance, and the writing style is approaching brilliant. But, what that said, I have to confess that it dragged for about 150 pages. That is a long time to drag. There are sections of the book that describe local politics, meetings, etc which are tedious and just plain boring. Also, the character development is slow to start, and I didn't really care much about the characters until after about page 200.<br />With all of that said, I am happy I stuck with it and I think this will be one of the most memorable books I have ever read. I also think that it gave me a new perspective on some aspects of human nature and society. Be aware that there is a dark thread that runs throughout the book and the ending is heartbreaking. Also, every character is damaged in one way or another - there wasn't a normal one in the bunch! However, after all of that, I think it is a worthwhile read! I was sad to have it end.
B0063IH60K|5.0|very good game whole family can play at their own level from young to old from novice to advance. glad we have it
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book, though not as good as the last, was still wonderful. it did leave me with a few questions, but overall, i loved it.
B008C1O8CA|5.0|I may be biased, considering I own all if Green Day's albums and consider them the greatest band in the known universe, but I loved this album. With the combination of tre's fantastic druming, mike's killer bass playing and billie's lyrics and guitar playing all the albums are awesome, and his one in no exception.
037575251X|5.0|Just an awesome read. Contains a few short stories, really good stuff though. To Build a Fire was unbelievably awesome
B009D5VNLS|2.0|I read a few of the 1 star reviews and to a point I can understand their frustration and where they might be coming from. I was going to do a 1 star but in all fairness to the people that enjoyed this movie I can understand this too.  This movie may be up your alley if you're a mother daughter duo.<br /><br />The movie deals with the main character being a female in a time where women were only suited for one type of role.  Since she was a princess her role was to find a suitor and help him rule as the successor to her father's kingdom.  The only problem is she doesn't want to be any part of an arranged marriage or to even play the role of a princess.  She would rather be out on a horse with her bow and arrows playing with the boys.  The movie begins showing her off her archery skills which are amazing, and goes on to show you the conflict that arise because of the differences between her and her mothers expectations on life and sacrifices(this movie definitely has a mother daughter type theme to it).  In order to escape the role of having suitors visiting her and being the successor of her parents kingdom she seeks out the help of a witch.  How she comes about finding the witch is somewhat interesting but the movie doesn't really go into much detail about it. Ultimately the wish that she makes in order to get herself out of her situation has a huge consequence on her mother and the rest of the movie deals with this issue.<br /><br />I was really disappointed with the writing in this movie.  The mother and daughter had some depth but the overall plot was weak.  You have a character with the ability to play with the big boys yet you don't really take that concept anywhere. She can also see things other people can't (the sprites or spirit things that lead her to the witch) but there is no real depth to that part of the story either. The entire mom changing into a bear didn't work for me.  A bear transformation movie that did was \\"Brother Bear\\".  Something else that Inoticed while I was in the theater watching this with my niece was other kids weren't really giggling over any of the \\"funny\\" parts of the movie.  That's because there wasn't a whole lot of laugh out loud parts in my opinion. I feel if you are comparing it to previous children's movies you can always find a comedic character to appreciate.  \\"Brave\\" tried to with the three little brothers but over all it was nothing special.  The evil bear at the end and his reason for being where he was and looking how he looked was actually pretty dark.  My niece got scared when he was introduced, and I know she didn't understand the concept of how his selfishness and greed had lead him to do what he did to his family and countrymen.  There is an overall moral to this story that everyone could share.  It was meant more in relation to a mother and daughter in the movie.  Even though my niece was scared towards the end she still liked the movie and so did her mom.<br /><br />I have a feeling most men are not going to write a review for this movie so I feel I should.  I am a 31 year male  (just got out of the Corps in May) with no kids.  I enjoy going to movies with my niece.  I love kids movies, animated films (except \\"Dumbo\\" because I balled my little eyes out as a kid and refuse to watch it again), and Pixar.  I honestly could not relate to any of the characters in this movie nor did really feel a sense of connection to the issues being talked about with the characters.  I know that this was my biggest problem in watching \\"Brave\\". Movies I enjoyed because of a connection with a character would be \\"The sword in the Stone\\", \\"Aladdin\\", \\"Lion King\\", \\"Shrek\\", \\"The Emperor's New Groove\\", \\"Tangled\\", \\"The Little Mermaid\\", \\"The Princess and The Frog\\", \\"Wall-e\\", and \\"Finding Nemo\\".  I could name a ton more, but that would take awhile.  Some of the movies I named also had catchy tunes to their story which made them all the more enjoyable.  I know the writers are trying a new approach to theirstorytelling with this movie. I just feel they could have done more, and I hope the next female adventure that they make, they do!

0345803485|2.0|I would expect better writing and a more \\"realistic\\" portray of the characters.  I mean the storyline has potential, it's just the writing styles and unrealistic portray of characters that disturbs me.  I agree with the reviewers about the limited vocabulary of the writer.

0316228532|5.0|Casual Vacancy is a beautifully written work of art. Nothing has been missed in the story. No storyline was neglected. Every character and every scene is perfectly orchestrated to completion. Reading Casual Vacancy is like eating that perfect meal. It starts off with an explosion of flavor, akin to a beautifully prepared appetizer and from there Rowling guides the reader through a perfectly told story that is nicely sustained. A good story is one that the reader does not want to put down, but is not forced to rush through. It is a story that once over, its characters will be missed. And once completed, the storyline line and messages are still being contemplated in the minds of its readers. This is the brilliance of Casual Vacancy.<br /><br />What about the bad reviews? What about all the readers who put it down out of what they said was disappointment and boredom? I was not dissuaded or discouraged when I read the very first publicized negative reactions to Casual Vacancy or heard from various friends and other reviewers, \\"My friend started this and was bored so she put it down\\". Harry Potter had such huge wide spread appeal that it makes sense that many of her former fans would give this a try or think about giving it a try, but Casual Vacancy - while nearly perfectly written in my opinion - is not a book that will have wide spread appeal. Despite my opinion on this, Casual Vacancy does have staying power and it has its own beauty. The thing about Harry Potter is that all sorts of readers consumed it. And all sorts of non-readers read it. To please that type of audience would take something like, well the Hunger Games to satisfy everyone. But that is not being fair to Harry Potter and its fans, Hunger Games (in my opinion) while fun and very good, does not come close to the brilliance of the Harry Potter series (and if you have only read the first one or two in the series, then you have no idea what I mean ... read the later ones!). My point - Casual Vacancy is not a repeat of Harry Potter in terms of having wide spread appeal.<br /><br />At the risk of being confusing and contradictory - Casual Vacancy is very similar to Harry Potter. Whaatttt????<br /><br />For readers of the entire series of Harry Potter, I am confident what remains with them even years after reading the books are the characters - the depth of the individuals developed, their struggles with moral dilemmas, the depiction of how absolutely horrible human beings can be to others when given the opportunity, their personal losses and their small victories. That is what I remember, more than any complicated mythology behind wands and horcruxes - I remember the characters. The Harry Potter books are immense in length and the story takes 7 books to tell, because it is the characters' stories that filled the pages.<br /><br />Casual Vacancy appears to be set in a nearly perfect setting: a small town where people know each other and have for generations. This is a town that is not war torn, is not fighting a famine or dangerous gangs and is not facing a spiraling out of control crime rate. This book does not have an external pressure affecting its characters or a complicated plot line each is struggling through. What this story comes down to is just the people appearing on the pages of the book and how people live their lives, how people treat each other, and what motivates them to act. The story is told from the alternating third person point of view a large number of characters. At first, keeping track of each character is task. I actually kept a cheat sheet. However, after about 10% of the book each character was solidly embedded and I no longer needed my notes. In the beginning of the story, it first appears that all of the characters are somehow involved with one main character that has died. And yes, while that is true they have that in common, that is not really the point - the point is not their connection but their own individual stories.<br /><br />The characters in Casual Vacancy are each trapped in their own universe of interests, surrounded by their own self focused motives. They cannot seem to see beyond their own pain and struggles and because of this, they don't see those who truly need help. There are heartbreaking scenes in this book, but they are essential to go through because it is a forcing of the reader to notice the pain of others - in a way that many of us probably do not in real life. This book provides an amazing lesson to each of us and is inspiring. Stop, open our eyes, help those around us, see people from their perspective instead of judging.<br /><br />Who would enjoy this book? Readers that enjoy literary fiction, character studies or societal observations . This book is not an adventure tale nor is it a story with a beginning, middle and end. It is a window into the lives of a small town - the readers get a glimpse and then it is over. Readers looking for a tight resolution, a beautiful and satisfying end, and the triumph of good over evil should not attempt Casual Vacancy. They will be disappointed. This is not a book to be skimmed, but instead it is one to be immersed in and it takes awhile to get through. So patient readers are needed as well. I plan on re-reading this book and I anxiously wait for Rowling's next effort.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I was skeptical, I admit. When I started reading the Hunger Games, I wasn't sure I would enjoy it. But curiosity got the better of me.<br /><br />The narrative is a little jarring at times, sometimes plain, and almost weak. At other times, it's very emotional and gets you right where it hurts, tugging on your heart strings. Katniss is a strong character, and you get right inside her head with the first person narrative.<br /><br />I found it a bit frustrating at times because there were things I could obviously see going on, that Katniss never quite caught on to until the very end. I'll leave out details because I don't want to spoil it, but even with that, this was a good story.<br /><br />The world is well built, and the history is believable. Panem is an interesting place, but I found myself almost wanting a map so I could see how it was laid out on what used to be North America. This wasn't a typical post-apocalyptic novel.<br /><br />All told, I'll probably carry on through the series. I'm interested in what happens next.
B0096DFBZQ|3.0|I enjoyed it, but not so much i just think it's a waste of memory, if you like pac-man and kart rally then go for it.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|good games. fun and lets you just waste time. unlocking new games are harder because of the prices but overall great.  I love playing it!
B00846REIS|5.0|Great book. Similar to 50 Shades in some wars but still a great read. These two main characters are sure to get you going.
B00992CF6W|5.0|At first their was only one guy writing code for Minecraft PE. Now their is either 3 or 4 people writing code. So that's why it had a rough start. I have been playing Minecraft PE since 0.2.0 version. So don't blame Mojang blame nobody.

B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I'm a 33 yr old female and not into video games of any kind. I got this app after my dad recommended it and LOVED it!!  I couldn't put it down.  Gorgeous graphics, cool story, great surprises.  Makes you think, but not sooo difficult that it's endlessly frustrating.  I've had my kindle fire for a year and I've never written an app review until now. Get this one!!!  I can hardly wait for the sequel!

B0027MJU00|3.0|I purchased this book after reading the authors other book  called \\"Gone Girl\\". Gone Girl was such a page turner that I expected the other books to be just as good. I was dissapointed. The last 100 pages became a page turner. It was  a slow read. Not as good.
0671027344|5.0|I fell in love with this book. I haven't felt this way about a book in a long time. It was fun and exciting, yet heart breaking all at the same time. From the moment you meet Charlie, you can't help but adore him and just want to leap into the pages and hug him. Every story he tells pulls you in deeper and makes you actually feel every word he writes as if he was telling you in person. As he pours his heart out to this mystery listener, you begin to understand there is more to this story than what is being said, which is revealed later in the book. All the characters are wonderful and add life to the book making it seem like it really happened. Stephen Chbosky wrote a beautiful story of life and how to deal with its never ending twists. For me, this book became an instant classic.
B0053O89WY|1.0|The BBT is a horrible show.  With fake audience laughter, it is now the #1 Rank Show in the following Category:  Least Laughs Per Show.<br /><br />The only reason why it is on is because $$$$$.  Listen, if you, or me, or your neighbor (the nice neighbor) had alot of $$, then we could keep any show on we wanted... as long as we kept writing the checks, they will still keep writing up unfunny dialogue, and horrible jokes.  I wonder, do they , when they write the script, do they insert the \\"fake audience laugh\\" into the script using the full description, or do they use an acronym, like FAL, or LB for Laugh Button.  It is so sad that we watch shows... we watch shows that have fake audience laughter sound bytes every 10 seconds...<br /><br />I know it is a bot off topic, but I remember when I was growing up, when I was very small, like 9 years old... I think it was ABC that TGIF - with Full House , Perfect Strangers (??) and The Charmings.  I used to suck on my Jolly Rancher sticks (which they discontinued because when they reach a translucent, thin level it slices peoples tongues (or is capable of).  So now we can't buy them - we have to go to the jolly rancher website.  Anyway, I liked those shows, because I was 9 years old.  (Oh, and I remember ALf was Monday night ;-)).<br /><br />My favorite (yes, I will be making a point, and then returning to bring together a nice closing that will highlight how poorly talented the writers are on big bang theory) show after school - THAT HAD LB (laugh button) was \\"DIFFERENT STROKES.\\"  I loved this show.  One day, when I was 10... I noticed that after watching the entire show's 22 minutes... I did not laugh once.  The LB was pressed 190 times, but I did not laugh at all.  The next day after school the same events played out.<br /><br />In closing, please understand that THE little bang theory is only on the air to promote the subliminal - the people paying for this wretched, not even close to being funny, embarrassing show do so because they want to instill within everyone's minds two things.<br /><br />1.  They want to subliminally program millions of American minds to come to accept \\"the chiity citty bang theory.\\"  Every time I write it build up, subliminally, an acceptance in your mind.  The reason why they do this is because they ave a plan to fake an alien invasion, and it involves trying to convince all religions that humans were created by aliens, etc... this way they can control everyone easier. (it is all about control and power)<br /><br />2. They want to subliminally make you accept non-traditional relationships. (heter-o, rhymes with et phone home).  Hey, I don't have any issues with this one... who cares, people have different chemical make-ups, it as to be accepted.  The first one is deceptive though.<br /><br />Finally, the next time you watch the unfunniest show in history, please try to focus on the laugh button... and ask yourself... is this funny?  What are they trying to get across here?<br /><br />I think you just may be interested in the results.<br /><br />Thanks for reading.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|This a visually exciting movie with a deep story and is a great continuation into the Alien storyline. The soundtrack is great too.

034580404X|5.0|This was probably the best books I have read to date.  I was a little shocked at myself when I first started reading, but the more I read the more I wanted to read.  Sent me through all sorts of emotions.  Loved it  I heard about it from a friend at work.  I downloaded it to my kindle from Amazon about midnight Sunday night, started reading it about 5pm Monday evening was through the 3rd chapter of book 2 by Tuesday morning when I went to work.  Had to quit reading Friday night cause I couldn't read any more for crying.  Finished the 3rd book Saturday morning about 8 am.  Where did E L James get this idea? I then brought the books from Amazon and I wanted to read it again.
B0053O89KG|5.0|I love Castle and all of the other characters in this show.  The show is well written.  Hopefully, Castle will be around for a while.

B001M3LG84|5.0|I was so impressed by this dvd that I have been using it as a gift for friends. Mirusa Louwerse was amazing and brought me to tears several times. I also think that the great Andre himself got caught up in the emotion. He had tears rolling during the playing of Walzing Matilda at the end of the concert.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Best movie in years....  Action packed,  fun with a good amount of comedy.  If you like 3d movies this is one of the best.  Highly recommend  this for your video library!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I have never read this kind of book before, but couldnt put them down. I hope e.l James writes the books and tells the story from Christians point of view. I will definitely read.these books over and over!!
B0034DGPEU|3.0|I found the historic background on the harsh life on a plantation and the place of an Irish immigrant in that society interesting.  However the characters didn't develop and there were so many cliches: the drunken cruel master...the empty-headed young beauty and the long-suffering slaves, though the word slave is seldom mentioned.  A good beach read.
075695195X|5.0|REVIEW WRITTEN BY ISAIAH LAWRENCE<br /><br />I think that the book The Amulet of Samarkand by Jonathan Stroud is probably one of the best books I've read. One reason is because of the unique way of describing events in the book. The way it starts out is when the young boy Nathaniel summons the demon Bartimaeus, only it's not from Nathaniel's point of view. You're seeing from Bartimaeus' eyes, in the first person. Nathaniel orders Bartimaeus to steal an artifact from a very important and powerful magician. The only thing is, you don't know why. Then you start flipping around from Bartimaeus' point of view, and Nathaniel's, except when it's Nathaniel's point of view, it's in the past, leading up to the events at hand.<br /><br />Of course, after Nathaniel gets the artifact, things start going wrong. The following events reveal a plot much bigger and more devious than Nathaniel could have imagined, and soon he is neck deep in danger and secrecy.<br /><br />Another thing that I loved was how Stroud took real events and put a fantasy into them. The book takes place in London, just before the revolutionary war, and the history of the world is unchanged, except that all the great nations were ruled by magicians, who got their power by enslaving demons of different variety and using there varied powers to rule. I especially loved the characters, and how real they were. They just seemed alive. Also the dry humor that is always there when you're hearing Bartimaeus' side of the story.<br /><br />  All in all, I'd say that this is one of the best books I've read, with great characters, amazing ideas, and a plot that will have you hanging on the edge of your seat. I'd have to rate this a full five stars, and that's only because that's as high as it goes. I'd recommend this for anyone who enjoys a good book of any sort.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Awesome app. Exactly what I needed. Use it all the time!<br />Use it all the time. So convenient. I highly recommend this app!
B0086449YA|5.0|Oct 20, 2012<br />After the last MK album - which I found to be sleep inducing - however many times times I tried to get involved with it, I thought long and hard about buying Privateering. The samples on Amazon held promise but now I have these two discs and have listened to them- I wished I 'd thought harder.  For the most part these are beautifully played and recorded and technically proficient songs - that lack any of the spark of a \\"Donegan's Gone\\" or \\"Cannibals\\".  Closest to anything with joy and feeling is \\"Beanstalk\\".  I should after 25 years shake off my conviction (? hope) that MK is ever going to do better than his output with Dire Straits. Sure artists have to grow - at least I didn't spring for the deluxe set.<br />Nov 8, 2012 - okay I retract most of the above review. Played the two discs through again last night and the music finally clicked - subtle, musical and very nuanced. Rather than soporific - like a yoga session - adsorbing and refreshing. And the recording is just wonderful.

B006LSZECO|5.0|Gillian Flynn always delights me with her raw, honest emotions. Living in the corporate world, I know people show one face to the public, and live in a whole other world internally. Gillian captured, beautifully, the nature of most human's crazy balance of our inside voices versus the voice we show the world. Life is not perfect. We make choices and live with them. Too many books try to rewrite the world to make everything always turn out perfectly. This book says, \\"Yep, sometimes life sucks-deal with it.\\" I loved it.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|For all the hype...it turned out to be ok. After a while the sex got predictable...I continued reading because it was interesting enough to keep me going, to find out what happens next. Kinda a mindless read.
B000JMKQX0|3.0|The book started out great, but after a while all the dialogue sounded a bit too contrived, like listening to the bit actors in an episode of Law & Order.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|If you have haves learning and reading about the two camps just wait till they finally get together! Rick Riordan is amazing and the stories just keep getting better!!!
B0015DROBO|5.0|I read this book because because of a friend's recommendation. I am glad I did.  I love the story about the corporate stuff coupled with cyber matter.  If you are in for a good thriller, I'd say pick up this book.  Another recommendation I have is to pick up The Calendar by Romina Wilcox and Also Cold Eyes by Romina Wilcox.  It has the same corporate element (minus the gory sex) as this one, though the setting is Silicon Valley.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|I saw some bad reviews about this app but I've had no problems at all 3 months into using it. You can see some interesting info on how much battery you use on each app between charges and it's also super useful for identifying what things drain your battery the most.
B0080XN3C6|5.0|Words cannot even describe this incredible artist but I am going to attempt to. Her debut album is absolutely incredible. Like candy (or your favorite dessert) for your ears... I bought this album in September and I have not gotten tired of it. I listen to it on repeat EVERY day! I must say though, her voice live is even better than her studio sound. Buy the Deluxe version because it has more KIMBRA. Just buy it. You won't regret it.<br />My favorites: Cameo Lover, Settle down, Sally I Can See You, Warrior, The Build Up, Two Way Street, Plain Gold Ring, Home, Limbo, Posse, Come Into my Head, Call me, Something in the way you are, Good intent, Old Flame.... YUP ALL OF THEM.. I can't get enough, hopefully she'll release a new album soon!<br />By the way she also has Wandering Limbs and Withdraw out but not on the US version :(
B00005JN0T|4.0|There are many films which some people love and other people hate. It is less common for the same person to both love and hate a film, but I felt that way about \\"I, Robot.\\" If you like science fiction and come at this with no preconceptions, not having read the original, you may well find it to be a fairly entertaining movie.<br /><br />However, if you are a big fan of Isaac Asimov, and particularly of his robot stories such as the original short story collection \\"[[ASIN:055338256X I, Robot]]\\" there is a strong possibility that you will be absolutely infuriated by this film.<br /><br />Firstly, this is because most of Asimov's robot books were works of absolute genius both for the time they were written and even by comparison with events and things which have been written since. Asimov's depictions of robots and computers are far closer to the reality of computers and machines which surround us today than were the mechanical frankenstein monsters which every previous author who wrote about robots created. To be in the same league as Asimov's books the film would have had to be brilliant, and it isn't.<br /><br />Secondly, the scriptwriters have used the name of one of Asimov's books, the names of two of his characters, and his three \\"laws of robotics\\" to produce a film which at first sight appears dangerously close to being exactly the type of robot story which Asimov detested and was trying to get away from.<br /><br />As Asimov explained himself, he wanted to move on from the cliche in which every film or book about robots retold the story of Frankenstein with robots as the monster, repeating a cycle in which, to quote him, \\"robots were created and destroyed their creators; robots were created and destroyed their creators.\\"<br /><br />Some Asimov fans will see the film \\"I Robot\\" as way too close to falling into exactly that pattern and will loathe it for this reason. The character Susan Calvin in the film, despite some good acting by Bridget Moynahan, is also a disappointing shadow of the much more human person created in Asimov's books.<br /><br />There is a massive irony in that in two of the most famous Sci-Fi stories about robots to be turned into films - this one and \\"Blade Runner\\" (Link: [[ASIN:B000G8NPWQ Blade Runner: The Final Cut (2-Disc Special Edition) [DVD] [1982]]]) - the film diametrically reversed the message of the original story in mirror image directions. In Philip K Dick's short story \\"Do androids dream of electric sheep\\" the robots were incapable of empathy and the readers' sympathies were meant to be mainly with the person who has the unpleasant job of eliminating them: Ridley Scott reversed this in \\"Blade Runner\\" in which sympathy lies with the robots.<br /><br />By contrast, Isaac Asimov's robot stories such as the original \\"[[ASIN:0586025324 I, Robot]]\\" were about as pro-robot as you can get: I don't want to explain this too precisely, to avoid \\"spoiling\\" the message of this film but but basically in this film director Alex Proyas changes the message in the opposite direction to Ridley Scott.<br /><br />In other words, perhaps Scott and Proyas should have swapped source books. If Ridley Scott wanted to make a pro-robot movie he could have made one based on \\"I, Robot\\" and Alex Proyas could have made a robot menace movie based on \\"Do Androids dream of Electric Sheep.\\" Instead Scott made a pro-robot movie based on perhaps the most brilliantly written anti-robot story and Proyas made a robot menace movie named after probably the most brilliantly written pro-robot book!<br /><br />Having said all that, even from the viewpoint of an Asimov purist there are good things about this movie. During the first half of the film, Will Smith as Del Spooner, a paranoid detective who is something equivalent to an anti-robot racist, is the only person who suspects that anything might be wrong with the robots. During this part of the story, all the robots, except one apparent rogue, act exactly as Asimov predicted that his \\"three laws of robotics\\" could be used to make them support human society. Some robots continue to do so throughout the book and are effectively sympathetic characters rather than demons.<br /><br />Other good things in the film - there is some excellent acting, particularly from Smith, Moynahan, and James Cromwell who plays the father of robotics, Dr Alfred Lanning. The robot character Sonny was created using CGI based on the movements of actor Alan Tudyk (who played the pilot Wash in Serenity / Firefly) in the same way that Gollum was created for the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" films. This was particularly well done, but special effects were spectacularly good throughout the film.<br /><br />Dramatic tension was well managed and you are made to care about most of the characters. There is some excellent humour in the film. Overall I didn't think it was a bad film.<br /><br />If you like science fiction films and have not read any of Asimov's robot novels, give this a try and you will very probably enjoy it. If you have read and enjoyed the original novels, and are willing to accept that a film inspired by them does not have to rigidly follow all of Asimov's ideas, then the same will apply.<br /><br />If however you are a huge Asimov fan and are likely to be offended by people who are not quite up to his level of genius taking liberties with his work, you should probably leave this film alone.

B009KKLQKO|1.0|The Beach Boys are awesome, their 50th Anniversary tour was amazing, but this release is a rip off!  The Beach Boys performed around 50 songs at each of the concerts including many amazing rarities with beautiful harmonies.  Unfortunately, this release is lacking all of the magic.  The corporate powers that be have decided to only include 21 songs on this DVD so that they can sell more copies to the casual fans.  This \\"Live In Concert\\" DVD contains only about 40% of what The Beach Boys performed at each of their shows.  This DVD does not contain most of the hauntingly beautiful harmonies and wonderful music that made this tour so magical.  This DVD release is an insult to anyone who truely appreciates the beauty and genius of The Beach Boys.  This DVD does not do the band justice, nor does it give the fans what they deserve.  Don't waste your money here so that the corporate big wigs can cash in on the legacy of The Beach Boys.  The fans deserve a release of an ENTIRE show.<br /><br />As a follow up in case you missed it, here are the songs that The Beach Boys performed that are NOT included on this DVD: Little Honda, Don't Back Down, Surfin Safari, Surfer Girl, The Little Girl I Once Knew, This Whole World, Wendy, Getcha Back, Then I Kissed Her, Please Let Me Wonder, You're So Good To Me, Kiss Me Baby, Come Go With Me, Why Do Fools Fall In Love, When I Grow Up To Be A Man, Dance Dance Dance, Darlin, Disney Girls, Good Timin', It's Ok, Cottonfields, Be True To Your School, Balad Of Ol Betsy, Still Cruisin, Don't Worry Baby, Pet Sounds, Add Some Music, Our Prayer, I Just Wasn't Made For These Times, Let Him Run Wild, California Dreamin, California Saga, In My Room, Surfer Girl, Forever, God Only Knows, All Summer Long, Do You Wanna Dance, Surfin USA, Barbara Ann, & Summers Gone.<br /><br />The Beach Boys performed ALL of these songs, and All of these songs have been left off this DVD!  Take a look at what you're being shafted out of getting and decide for yourself ifthis DVD is a winner!
B005S9EJ46|5.0|The movie has a all star cast. The films centers around the guest and staff @the hotel. It enfolds in to enjoyable film that is worth seeing over and over again. It is one of the few movies in a long time that I can say I would buy the DVD. Buy it or rent it you will not be sorry.

B007THA4FI|5.0|This book is an excellent read.  All the elements of the plot work together and there are no events which, when one has finished reading the book, one wonders what roles these events played in the overall unity of the story.  The characters and the situations created for them are very real.  The plot, at times, is quite gut wrenching, but true to life.

B008MEM24S|5.0|tons of fun.  love games i can actually play around the kids.  Phineas and ferb  is a great show.  love all the characters.

B000BTGY1O|5.0|Breakfast at Tiffanys-a true classic. Enjoyed this movie from start to finish. The extras were great too. And Moon River? What else is there to say.
B00824ZJ84|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised by this album.  I tend to take Amazon's suggestions to heart and sampled a few songs before buying this album after it came up in my suggestions.  Ferguson reminds of Sade with a modern twist.  I like the lyrics, her gritty, emotional voice, and the flow of the songs through the album.  Perfect album to put on as the nights get colder.
0316228532|5.0|I was so immersed in Casual Vacancy and realized only when I finished the book today, that I'd been as deeply involved as ever I had been in the Harry Potter series.  But this time there was the deeper, darker, adult current that is behind the lives the children lived through in the earlier series.  JK has proven once more her immense capacity for character development and the complex inner workings of the desperately narcissistic psyches thriving in any community.  Having worked as both a community therapist and a school counselor in my own career, her descriptions of families and children at risk and those dealing with addictions were written so precisely as to feel like  real families on every street in every town.  The ego conflicts and complex weaving among the adults of her community also accurately reflect the human tendency to scapegoat the less fortunate and hide their sufferings from our own eyes because they too closely reflect our own hidden and feared pain.  I would not have sacrificed one page or one word of this gifted artist's book.  I was in awe till the very end.  Thank you and I can't wait to read the next one!  So, Bravo, Ms. Rowling!  Bravo!!
B002RSDW80|5.0|Once again Meryl Streep has done her thing.  It was a great movie, I enjoyed it with my daughter who loves to cook.  We sat and watched it and I have sat once again and watched it by myself.  Of course Tucci is always great in his movies.  Patricia R. Stanley
B008J34466|3.0|Why is Pink so immature that she needs to use such foul words in her songs? Is it her way of being relevant with teenagers and girls who desperately want to be just like her? Pink's songs remain predictable and boring. It means that this is the type of album wt no one will be listening to in 5 to 10 years time. Pink is incapable of producing a classic album and a lot of that is due to her appalling choice of words.
B005LAIHR2|1.0|Horrible movie!  Like a piece of gum or something worse stuck to the bottom of your shoe.  Just crap!  Don't waste your money.  No story.  Bad acting.  Cruddy characters.  Tom Cruise especially was a massive disappointment.  One of his worst films and performances ever.
B0091REZMW|5.0|it is awesome but you have to buy things with your money to have diamonds so you cant get everything unless your rich.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love it. I'm addicted. The app is so easy to access from my phone and kindle. It is great.
B006VGGAC4|5.0|I highly recommend this revealing book. Arnold is still a great person in my opinion, despite what the media says.
B0091IIP6S|1.0|Tried to return it because of nasy echo and the mute button doesn't work with case.  No word yet from the vendor.  Would not recommend.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|i love this app. im thinking about buying the full version. i have been able to get to sleep faster and have pleasant dreams.
B005GHN2GG|5.0|This book was a tribute to the genre, it's writing read like a fantasy novel but maintained the elements of romance necessary to still be a romance story. The characters had genuinely interesting flaws and broke some of the standards we as readers normally encounter. This made for a refreshing change.
B003TSEEDY|3.0|Fast read but predictable. Written in letter form. Would have liked to find out who Charlie is writing the letter too.
B005LAJ212|5.0|The complete first season of REVENGE was even better than watching the first time. Being able to watch it at your own pace makes a big difference and was easier to catch details missed with a rushed viewing. Love the characters!
B004LWZWGK|5.0|I am such a big batman fan, I knew I had to see this on the midnight showing the day it came out! And OMG THOSE SPECIAL EFFECTS ARE TO DIE FOR! It even sounded like there were real bullets going off in the theater, that's how realistic they were! I guess some fools thought they were a little TOO realistic so they were ducking or running out of the theater, oh well, their loss for missing the action. My only complaint though is that there seemed to be bullets going off when character's would just be talking or something, like they couldn't turn off the sound effects. But when I was walking out of the theater I realized I got shot in the arm earlier, THAT'S how badass this movie is! They've crossed over that 3D bulls*** and went straight to 4D!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I don't know how I was expecting it to end but Mockingjay definitely did not disappoint me. Heartbreaking yet hope springs forth once all is said and done. Justice prevails and the Dark Days of the Capitol have come to an end. I laughed. I cried and every other emotion in between. The Hunger Games is hands down the best series I've read. Long live Katniss Everdeen. The Girl Who Was On Fire!
B004SH40BQ|5.0|Great sound quality, good range. Its very small and out of the way. Only issue is that when used with the ipod nano the battery life suffers.

B0040ZA2D6|1.0|This band has no soul, no style, no talent, and no substance. Everyone needs to ignore plastic garbage like this. This is to music, what mcdonalds is to food.
B008RTE09S|2.0|It is not a great movie, we all know that going into it, it is actually quite bad but, I am not going to talk about what is IN the movie...I am going to talk about the remaster, it is AWFUL, the picture quality is decidly low res....why bother with BlueRay, standard DVD would have produced more than enough bandwith for this..the sound 5.1, should have been left Mono, the remaster of the MMT CD has far far better sound quality....no, I was hoping that this would at least be a decent remaster but not...my expectations should have been lower after buying Yellow Submarine, but, sadly, I was hopeful....this is a dreary and dull remaster of a not very good film...no matter how much I love the Beatles, this feels like a money grab...
B0083SBJXS|1.0|The film is AMAZING and well worth the wait but the extras on this are a HUGE appointment, the lack of extras is unforgiveable
B009KHDT0C|3.0|This movie had one or two redeeming moments, but suffice it to say the best parts were in the previews (shocker). Mostly it was a lot of sex and sex appeal, and cat and mouse. There wasn't even a resolution to the story - not to mention the horrible acting. If I were you and you really wanted to see this movie, wait until you get a free redbox code, don't waste $3 or $4 dollars on it.
B008MM9630|4.0|good game. cute graphics. if u don't want to interact u don't have to. may take a while for some plants
B002APU580|4.0|This film is a very beautiful love story.  I will surely watch it more than once.  The only negative: the sound quality of the production is not the best... that's why 4 stars instead of 5.  It is a five star story. : )
B008XG1X18|4.0|it took me a few mins to get use to it, but now it seems I can't put it down. I love it!!!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I am a HUGE fan of Rick Riordan's books. I have read the first two books in this series, (The lost hero and the son of neptune) and both of those books should have gotten around 4 to 5 stars. The Mark of Athena, however, is my personal favorite out of the 3 of them. I LOVE this book!<br />3 reasons why this book deserves more than 5 stars:<br />-narrated by 4 different demigods in third person<br />-each character has a more unique personality<br />-story and plot VERY well written<br />I recommend this book and/or series to anyone who likes to read about romance, adventure, and fantasy.<br />The Mark of Athena is based off of Greek mythology and folklore, and contains little violence in my opinion.<br />Thank you very much for reading this review. There will be a fourth book to this series (called the Heroes of Olympus) caled the House of Hades and realeasing in Fall 2013.
B0051UP5NQ|1.0|Using the software the way it was intended requires an additional purchase and an additional download.  This is highly unethical. If you want more money,  raise the price.  Don't screw with users by tacking additional charges on.
B006H5120E|5.0|Of course, I had seen this movie before, but watching it in 3D made it a whole new experience - it was wonderful.  It wasn't so much about the story line but more about the visual spectacle, and I found myself saying 'wow' throughout the movie.  I'm going to see it again.

B001NXBRJG|4.0|After all the years and years of glowing reports, I finally bought the DVD and couldn't ever get into the story, despite really wanting to. However, the hours and hours of 'making of' features were more than worth the price of the blu-ray disc.
0345803485|5.0|A wonderful and captivating book. I enjoyed reading it very much and couldn't put it down.  Who cares if the way it was written wasn't perfect, who is? Great book, great story line, will read it again :)
0765356139|4.0|I absolutely loved Mistborn, the first book in this trilogy. So much that I decided to run to my bookstore right after finishing it and purchase the sequel, because I was so excited to see what happened next. Sanderson did not disappoint, as he took an untraveled route in creating the aftermath of toppled evil empire; the city is in ruins, and the newly appointed young king has no idea what to do about it. It is very realistic in its portrayal of how unstructured and broken a land is rendered after its oppressor is taken out of the picture. Most stories end with the destruction of an evil ruler, and leave it at that. But Sanderson dares to go beyond that. He shows that despite a king's sincere attempts to create a free utopian society, it is difficult to teach people a new way of life when they have grown accustomed to the stability of their old government, no matter how much it oppressed them. It is also unrealistic to expect people with a 'slave mentality' to rise up and govern themselves, after thousands of years of oppression. I like that Sanderson addresses these political issues, rather than shying away from them, in exchange for an easier story to tell.    Sanderson's story is a complex one, with many subplots, many characters, and many twists. I enjoyed the profound nature of many dialogues within this book, and I thought that many phrases were very powerful. However, I did feel that some of the themes were beaten over the head, such as the \\"lock and key\\" concept, as well as the issue of trust (you'll see what I'm talking about when you read the book!). I liked that many new characters were introduced in this book, and more attention was focused on some of the secondary characters of the last book (Sazed, Breeze, etc) and it was great to have more insight on these characters and see that a level of depth was added to them (particularly Sazed. You even get a closer look at how his Feruchamist powers work!) I loved some of the new characters and relationshipsthat were created, such as the Kandra (you get to learn a bit more about these interesting yet mysterious creatures) and Zane, a pretty crazy and dark character. However, I felt that most of these relationships, although beautifully developed, broke off rather suddenly without warning, and without much explanation. I still don't really understand what happened with Zane, it all happened so quickly, I wasn't really able to process it. Hopefully, these loose ends were left intentionally, and we'll get more of an explanation of what happened in the third book.    But this goes back to one of my main criticisms of this book, and perhaps even the last book, too: the relationships, albeit a few main ones, aren't developed enough. For example, Vin's relationship with Elend always seemed a bit rushed to me. One day they're flirting with each other at a ball, the next day they've already fallen deeply in love with each other. This story also suffers from the same abruptness in regard to the development of their \\"romantic relationship\\". It is clear that the two love each other, but not really clear as to WHY. All of the conversations alluding to their relationship seem to be rushed and one dimensional. Even Sazed's fleeting relationship with another terris woman in this book seems so underdeveloped and hard to believe. I guess I shouldn't expect too much when it comes to romance in this book. After all, the book was written by an author who mostly writes sci-fi adventure novels. But I do feel that the shallowness of relationships is present among the platonic relationships too. Such as the relationship between Clubs and Breeze in this book; it comes off as very contrived. I suppose it must be hard to devote more time to developing solid relationships when you have so much to worry about in your book; wars, politics, mythologies, mystical powers, and magical creatures. There are several subplots for the author to juggle, and he does it expertly. I couldn't put the book down, and read it all in a matter of days. There were parts that made me laugh, yet other moments that made me ponder over the brilliance and truth of some of the moral messages presented in this book. The suspense never ended, as there were always new, shocking twists to the story. And just like in the last book, I loved how everything tied together at the end.    I could tell that the author learned a lot in between writing the first book and this one, as his writing style and techniques improved palpably. The allomatic powers were explained better, the action scenes were easier to follow, and, as I mentioned before, more emphasis was placed on developing minor characters. I liked that the excerpts at the beginning of each chapter (the ones from the \\"holy book\\") were placed together in the chapters, making it easier to read them as a cohesive whole and thereby understand them better. However, I did feel that after a while stating and restating the same excerpts got a bit repetitive and annoying, and found myself glazing over the passages taken from the excerpt. But I like that the author is taking clear steps to improve his writing, and experimenting with new ideas, rather than relying on an old formula. I think it's his courage to try new writing techniques that led to the success of this book, rather than allowing it to fall into the dreaded sophomore slump.    Overall, this book was an enjoyable read, a satisfying sequel, and I can't wait to read the next book in the trilogy!
B008673ZAQ|3.0|The book was good, but the overall story left me with way too many questions. Half the time i thought: WTF did he do that!? I was hoping it would make sense in the end, but it didn't.
B007HU7NBK|4.0|After pre-ordering this e-book months ago, it finally came this week!  Boy was I excited!  Okay this may sound stupid, but I was a little shocked that he shared that he was brought up Catholic.  As a lay Catholic myself, it was a connection that helped me understand each thought, word and page.  I was a total Roger Taylor fan as an adolescent Duranie, so seeing John was never a big deal to me.  I never quite got the John \\"aura\\"  back then...I always complained they never showed Roger enough in the videos!  LOL<br />I just finished the book today and never realized how shy he was and how overwhelming the kind of life they all lived could have been for someone who was Mommy's little boy, non-sporty klutz, who couldn't seem to find their place in the world.  A male kindred me!  As he found music as his salvation, I also did.  Though I did not take it up professionally as he has, it does make my life, as a disabled person, a whole lot better to deal with.  He was lucky to find 4 other kindred souls to share his vision of the world and take it over.<br />Yeah, I admit the whiny stuff about the female fans outside his house each day and how he had to creep to a window each day to see how many were out there before he moved about the house was stupid.  But its part of the job, which served him very well in the beginning and even today are his bread and butter. Suck it up buttercup!  And also funded his drink, cocaine, MDA, his homes, wives, children and his \\"charisma\\".<br />Now that I have 2 points of view between this book and Andy Taylor's book \\"Wild Boys\\", this was a wild ride they both enjoyed but John seems to enjoy a tad bit more.  Andy can't play well with others it seems and John just wants to please them all.  For those of us who were and still are fans, thank you John for your story.

While this set does not really have special features, for someone like me, that is just fine.  I don't pay for the special features, I want the movie.  This is a great set it that is what you are looking for.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|This product cools my cpu as expected, if not better.  It runs cooler<br />than my old computer which was like a furnace.
B007N0REX6|5.0|The first time I listened to this album I don't know what drugs I had or hadn't taken, because I didn't like it.  But next time around the mists had cleared (or my ears had, whatever...) because not only did I like the album, I couldn't stop playing it for about two weeks.  Now several months down the track I don't go many days without giving it a spin, which is usually testament to a quality album with lasting appeal.<br /><br />I am glad that Slash has gone with only one singer for the entire album, and one style of music.  The previous album had some real gems on it but I couldn't take to it as a whole.  Some of the singers shat me to tears, and some of the styles just weren't what I wanted to hear from Slash, nor what I think he's best at.  This album scores big ticks from me in those regards.  The pure hard rock style of the music on this album resonates with me in a big way.  This is the kind of music I grew up with and really haven't had that much of in recent years (at least not this quality).  Apocalyptic Love really is a very welcome dose of straight forward riff-rock from start to finish, only slowing down occasionally for few songs which still pack some serious punch none the less.<br /><br />Myles Kennedy is a great vocalist, not bad either as a supporting axeman, and the friendship and chemistry between the two guys really shines through on Apocalyptic Love in terms of both the performances and the song writing.  Kennedy sings with terrific diversity on this album, sometimes almost whispering, sometimes shrieking, sometimes screaming, sometimes almost snarling, and occasionally I hear the ghost of Axle coming through.  Those who claim he's a one trick pony really need to get their ears checked because this guy is one of the best vocalists of modern rock.<br /><br />The man himself delivers the riffs and solos all his fans would want and expect, with quite a bit of variety without ever overdoing it.  Slash doesn't fall into the trap of trying to prove he's the worlds greatest guitarist and bedazzle us with guitar god wizardry.  He knows that at the end of the day it is the songs as a whole that do the talking, thus all the guitar riffs, melodies and solos serve only to enhance the songs as a whole to shine.  This is no doubt because Slash's influences stem from 70's rock such as The Rolling Stones and Aerosmith, an era in which the song was the key, before the early 80's guitar heroes arrived and being fast and flashy became what mattered most (besides big hair and spandex).<br /><br />Forget Velvet Revolver, Snakepit and whatever else, I hope these guys continue working together and this becomes Slash's main project because it's the best album he has done since leaving Guns N Roses, and exactly the album I have been waiting many, many (too many!) years to hear from him.<br /><br />Preferred tracks:  Not For Me, Bad Rain, Shots Fired, Standing In The Sun, Apocalyptic Love, Far And Awaye's the worlds greatest guitarist and bedazzle us with guitar god wizardry.
