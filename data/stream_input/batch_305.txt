B00008PW3Q|5.0|I have been a follower of Fleetwood Mac in all its incarnations since the first time I heard &quot;Landslide&quot; in the mid 70's.  Although there have been low points through the years where the band seemed to have lost its identity (lineup changes, etc.), I have to say, &quot;Say You Will&quot; ranks right up there with &quot;Rumours&quot; among their best work.  I picked up the new CD this morning and couldn't believe my ears. Listened to it several times throughout the day, in the car, and at work.  I was transported back 28 years, while at the same time being amazed at how fresh and &quot;cutting edge&quot; they sound today.  Can't wait to hear it on my home system, as the production work is amazing.  Anxious to purchase the DVD Audio version as well.  The absence of Christine McVie is a disappointment, but the Buckingham/Nicks energy is palpable in every track.  Standouts are &quot;Miranda&quot; and &quot;Running through the Garden&quot;, but there is not a bad cut on this disc.  I have found my CD for the summer!  The music will be difficult to classify, but I sincerely hope it gets the airplay and recognition it deserves.
0783227434|3.0|The third movie of the Evil Dead Trilogy don't deserve this poor DVD edition. Ok, it's the worst movie in the trilogy, but it's still awesome, unlike the DVD.<BR>  It's rated R for violence, blood... The movie is the Evil Dead II sequel, where Ash \\"falls\\" in year 1300. His mission is to come back to his own time, but expect a lot of work in order to do that. He has to take the Necronomicon (Book of the Dead) from an unholy graveyard and a lot of other things. It's a comedy with some horror elements. <BR>  The DVD features audio  in English (not 5.1!), French. And it's captioned in English and Spanish. The extras are:<BR>- Theatrical Trailer: What can I say about it? It's the theatrical trailer!<BR>- Bios: Cast & Crew main bios.<BR>- Scene Selection: C'mon, what's a DVD without this?<BR>-  Production Notes: A bunch of texts. A little boring...<BR>  Overall, but this only if you can't find another edition... This is one of the worst Army Of Darkness' editions... But, if you can't find buy it for the movie, which is fun and it's part of the awesome Evil Dead Trilogy.
0060975768|5.0|Without doubt, this is one of the best accounts of military history that I have ever read.<br />'We Were Soldiers' describes two separate engagements between the NVA and American forces in the Ia Drang valley in Vietnam. This battle, fought in 1965, was one of the first 'real' encounters between US and NVA forces, and it changed the Vietnam War from a political exercise to full fledged conflict. <br />Essentially, the book is divided into two stories, that of the soldiers that fought at Landing Zone (LZ) X-Ray, and that of the soldiers that fought at LZ Albany, two locations in the Ia Drang valley. <br />The book is frighteningly honest about the harsh realities of war, and does an excellent job at showing the human cost of war. Lt. General Harold 'Hal' Moore writes in a very forthright and honest manner, and it is obvious he is someone that does not mince words, and I believe that every word in this book is truth.<br />The book isn't easy to read, and it certainly isn't a light, entertaining story. If anything, the book is closer to a history text, rich in detail and thoroughly referenced, but that doesn't mean it isn't a fascinating read. <br />But overall, what I admired so much about this book was the honesty of it. Nothing is withheld, all is told, typical of 'Hal' Moore. After reading this book, it is obvious to me that Hal is a man of the highest integrity and earned every star on his shoulder.<br />I am an Australian, and although the men at Ia Drang weren't from my country, I was still deeply moved after reading this book. Every man that served in that valley was a hero, and I admire them greatly. I recommend all Americans read this book, young and old.

B00008PW3Q|5.0|This is the first long awaited new material by Fleetwood Mac since their 'Tango in the Night' album. For those expecting more soft rock sounds, you're in for a surprise - good or bad depending on your musical tastes. This outing is more on the edge than any of their previous material. The usual strong guitar by Lindsey Buckingham is still much in evidence but clearly a new focus. Christine McVie opted out of this project.<BR>A must have for new and old Mac fans.
B00008PW3Q|5.0|The critics love most of Say You Will, but they're leary about Lindsey's experimentation (mostly on guitar--and it will blow you away). I can't think of two better reasons to buy this album. <br />Critics want to categorize and standardize. You just can't do that with this brilliant piece of work. It will stand the test of time because it's innovative and quite courageous. If you want something fresh, gutsy, even a bit &quot;out there&quot;, you'll find it on Say You Will. The Mac is Back, better than ever. <br />There are a number of potential hit singles on SYW, in addition to the already heavily-played &quot;Peacekeeper&quot;: &quot;Destiny Rules, &quot;Say You Will&quot;, &quot;Everybody Finds Out&quot;, &quot;Running Through the Garden&quot;, &quot;Illume (9-11)&quot; and &quot;Say Goodbye&quot;, to name my personal favorites. <br />And speaking of Illume (9-11), it's cool to see Fleetwood Mac take on some political issues--&quot;Murrow Turning Over in His Grave&quot; being the best example (with some astounding guitar work that has the critics gnashing their teeth, hee hee!). Lindsey just refuses to play by the rules.<br />Buy it.
0783225849|5.0|Psycho ranks easily within my top five personal favorite movies. It is simply one of the most finely crafted, exceptionally told, and deeply terrifying stories ever put on film. I wouldn't know how many times I've seen it in all. Though I'm only 22 years old, so I haven't seen it 100 times like I'm sure many older movie buffs have. It certainly seems like the definitive Hitchcock film, and certainly encapsulates most of his cinematic ideals and themes (as does the earlier Rear Window). You've got the blonde woman, you've got sexual repression, you've got mother-son relationships, you've got dark humor, you've got the MacGuffin (the forty-thousand dollars), you've got murders and of course Hitchcock's usual suspense and brilliance as a visual storyteller. Hitch used his camera as well as other directors used words. Often he used the camera in place of words, telling bits of the story with little more than images and even sometimes gestures.<br />The story was based loosely on the story of Ed Gein, the whacko murderer of the 50s. Novelist Robert Bloch based his novel on Gein, who was turned into Norman Bates by Hitchcock and screenwriter Joseph Stefano. Psycho was a pretty small production, especially when compared to the grandeur of his two previous films, North By Northwest and Vertigo. To save on production costs, he used the crew from his TV show Alfred Hitchcock Presents. However, this \\"small production\\" turned out to be one of the most influential films in cinema history and a box office phenomenon. Psycho, as much as the TV show, made Alfred Hitchcock into a household name.<br />\\"See it from the beginning - or not at all!\\" read the lobby cards at the theaters. Indeed Hitchcock asked theaters not to admit viewers after the film had started. Probably because of the fact that Janet Leigh, the leading actress and advertised as such, was killed off within the first 50 minutes. An outrageous idea at the time. Who on earth would have their main character, played by avery well-known actress, killed in the first half of the movie? Only the master of suspense. Nearly as outrageous as this was having the killer be a man dressed as a woman, and have the victim be killed while naked in the shower. These ideas would be commonplace nowadays, but things were very different in 1960 upon Psycho's release. The film was also the first to show a toilet flushing on-screen. <br />The really interesting thing about Psycho is the little details. Subtleties that enhance the film and add a layer of depth to the experience. Things such as the symbolism that Hitchcock uses. The theme of birds, for example. Marion and Norman talk about birds. Norman is a taxidermist as a hobby and has stuffed birds in his office. There are pictures of birds outside the shower where Marion is killed. Indeed when Norman discovers the body, he knocks a picture of a bird off the wall. Hitchcock devotes a cutaway shot to this, showing the picture land on the floor. Bird, of course, being slang for woman, a \\"bird\\" has just been knocked off. Norman did not intend to knock off the picture, perhaps just as he didn't intend to knock off Marion. Mother did, however, intend such. The film's opening shot could be seen as a bird's-eye-view. Marion's last name is \\"Crane\\", a type of bird. Of course, Hitchcock devoted his next film to birds of a different sort. There is much symbolism apart from the bird element. The changing color of Marion's bra for example. Early in the film, Marion wears a white bra. Later, after stealing the money, she wears a black one. Also note at the very end of the film, the shot of Mother's skull superimposed over Norman's face. It's subtle things like this contribute to the overall effect of the film. <br />Sexual jealousy is a big part of the story. Norman Bates, who lives with half of his mind dominated by his deceased mother, is constantly in fear of Mother. He's purely a momma's boy. Mother, however, is jealous of any females that try to get close toNorman and promptly does away with them. \\"I won't have you bringing strange young girls in for supper! By candlelight, I suppose, in the cheap erotic fashion of young men with cheap erotic minds.\\" Sexual repression again. Norman expresses his desire to defy Mother, and Marion is his opportunity. <br />It's a story with many complexities and many themes, which can be discovered with multiple viewings. . Suffice to say that Psycho is one of the very best films ever made and you should see it many times. Don't just see it, but experience it.
B00005UK1F|5.0|THIS IS IT!<br />This is the CD I would take on a long trip if I was limited to one item. A fabulous kaleidoscope of sounds that captivate your senses for this marathon one hour(YES 60 MINUTES)song/album. The Gods surely whispered in Tchort's ear(band leader/composer)while he wrote this masterpiece, for it smacks of divine intervention. What is amazing is the fact that it manages to hold your interest (it really absorbs you) and keep you coming back for more. In fact when I first listened to it I was in my car and it mesmerized me. I wouldn't stop driving because I didn't want to stop the music. I keep driving for an hour even though I only went to the post office 2 miles away.<br />Now what about the music.This song/album is so hard to categorize I won't try but it's predominantly symphonic and dark melodic with many light and complementing heavy moments. It is symphonic in nature and has enormous presence. I can also sense a touch of Pink Floyd, Queensryche and Therion, similar but different. For me to continue to describe this treasure would be folly. There have been so many glowing reviews written on this masterpiece by people more eloquent than I, so I'm going t borrow some of the highlights from these reviews.<br />Lets start with what the record company (The End Records) has to say; \\"Immensely epic in scope, blasting through dark passages of swollen, over-distorted guitars to serene, idyllic moments of acoustic and choral enchantment, this release will surely go down in history as one of the most progressive, innovative albums to ever see the light of day.<br />More than 30 musicians were involved into this epic project, including full opera and children's choirs, classical composers, saxophonists, church organists and a lot more. This highly complex work of art was recorded using 150 tracks and almost 600 samplers\\".<br />One glowing review says; \\"I could review this album with a single word...EPIC! It's a huge album that draws from pretty much every genre of metal music to make one fantastic album.\\"<br />Another reviewer says; There are so many textures and moods contained in this sixty minutes that it simply leaves you awestruck upon it's completion, as if ending some surreal journey.\\"<br />This reviewer states; \\"It is a tapestry of atmospheric, spacey, dreamy, often melancholy Pink Floyd-ish passages that flow into long, driving, relentless, irresistible buildup, climaxing into explosive, triumphant passages.\\" She further adds; \\"This is one of the best CDs in my collection, and my favorite purchase in at least the last year if not longer.<br />And finally this writer starts off his review as follows; \\"Welcome my friends, welcome to Green Carnation. you are about to have a close encounter with a symphonic doom metal opus. So please be seated comfortably, get a long cold drink and let yourself be overwhelmed by the wave. It starts with sunrise to warm you up and ends with sunset music.\\" Do you get the picture?<br />Here is the AMG biography on Green Carnation; \\"Green Carnation was formed in 1990 in Norway by X-Botteri, Cristopher Botteri, Tchort, and Anders Kobro. They found singer Richart Olsen and began to play around their homeland. The band managed to release a demo before Tchort left to join black metal superstars Emperor; Olsen left soon after and the band decided to disband. The remaining members reformed as In the Woods... and went on to have a successful black metal career of their own, but by 1998 the original members decided to re-form the band with new drummer Alf T. Leangel. The debut release, mostly written by Tchort, finally made it to stores in late 2000. Although Tchort still managed to start the brutal thrash metal band Blood Red Throne between albums, by 2001 he was back in the studio recording Green Carnation's sophomore effort, Light of Day, Day of Darkness. A high concept project, the entire album was actually one song that lasted an hour, jumping between black metal, psychedelic rock, and goth metal. - Bradley Torreano.\\"<br />Tchort himself writes inside the album literature; \\" Light of Day...is musically dedicated to my son, Damien Aleksander for bringing joy, inspiration and meaning to my life, and lyrically dedicated to Christian and Christopher Botteri - on an everlasting mental and emotional journey\\".<br />I coulld write a book about this phenomenal creation, but here's the bottom line. LIGHT OF DAY is a profoundly, serious composition that is a must for the symphonic and progressive rock collector! GET IT, TURN UP THE VOLUME, PUT ON YOUR HEADPHONES, FASTEN YOUR SEAT BELT AND GET READY FOR THE RIDE OF YOUR MUSICAL LIFE!!! TEN STARS!goth metal. - Bradley Torreano.\\" <br />Tchort himself writes inside the album literature; \\" Light of Day...is musically dedicated to my son, Damien Aleksander for bringing joy, inspiration and meaning to my life, and lyrically dedicated to Christian and Christopher Botteri - on an everlasting mental and emotional journey\\". <br />I coulld write a book about this phenomenal creation, but here's the bottom line.

B00005BJ2O|5.0|This CD is incredible. once you hear it, it becomes yor favorite CD and you just can't stop listening to it.  i recomend this to anyone and everyone. i think that this CD is put together very well and is full with incredible songs from the movie. AGAIN i recomend this to you, i think you should buy it or borrow it from a friend first and expirience it.
B00005OM4N|3.0|Like a puppet being changed offstage, here is the new and improved version of a so called woman.  Britney is banking off her good looks and same mindless formula used by many popular figures in media...change and create a new so-called improved image or version of yourself, sure this is a better performance than her latter, but come on, her corporate masters like ruining little girls, just like they did before with Madonna cept britney is starting a little younger, and now she is trying to start her acting career hahaha dont make me laugh, unless she is in a skin flick dont bother going. its madonna's clone, im just waiting for her to change her name to some sort of symbol alla prince.
0140386335|5.0|After reading the book, and having seen the film, the book is leaps and bounds better.  Of course, this is usually the case, but I felp obligated to tell the public likewise.<br />As other readers have mentioned, you should purchase the hardback which will certainly be a staple for your home library.  The hand drawn illustrations beginning each chapter are beautiful and feature simple sketches of characters you will soon meet.  The story takes place both here on Earth (printed in purple font) and in Fantastica (yes, Fantastica not Fantasia, printed in green).  The point, children should never fear to wish or dream.  It is written in a style that both adults and children will enjoy and I highly reccommend this book to everyone interested.  There are so many unforgettable characters like the Rock Biter (huge stone giants), will-o-the-whisp (flying pixie), Falcor (the flying luck dragon) and more... Ygramul and Grograman the fire lion, as one reader already stated will never be forgotten and add a lot of suspense to the story... nestle this one in, right next to the \\"Harry Potters\\" on your bookshelf... you won't be sorry!
B000002NIW|5.0|The Deftones are a unique band. They don't believe in trends. When they record or play live, there are imperfections, but they only add to the rawness of the sound. Around the Fur is an amazing example of this.<br />This was the first CD I ever bought that is considered metal (I got Korn's self-titled a few weeks later), and this was probably the best first metal record I could buy. The riffs really hit home, Chino displays his chillingly beautiful voice, and with everything else, it all combines to make this outstanding CD.<br />This one is really best listened to from beginning to end, and now that I think about it, there is not one track that is a complete standout. That just shows you the consistancy of the album. All 10 tracks (plus the hidden one) are outstanding.<br />It's not the amazing heavy metal opus that White Pony is, but I think this is actually harder and more consistant than White Pony. I recommend this to anyone who likes heavy music. If you don't like heavy music...I recommend this also (remember, it was the first metal record I bought). Oh yeah, one more thing, this is a warning...you will not absorb this record, it will absorb you.
B00004OCRN|4.0|&quot;Chimes&quot; is a really fine little record. It was originally released for the benefit of Mr Kite - no, wait, Amnesty International - and it opens with a powerful, slow rendition of &quot;Tougher Than The Rest&quot;, rolling along like a monolith, all thunderous drums and vibrating bass notes from the keyboards of Roy Bittan and Danny Federici.<br />Then follows the first release of the excellent rocker &quot;Be True&quot; (which showed up on &quot;Tracks&quot; ten years later), and a six-minute cover of Bob Dylan's &quot;Chimes Of Freedom&quot; (a few verses are cut, otherwise it would have been a ten minute version).<BR>Bruce Springsteen, it has been said, grew up wanting to be either Roy Orbison or Bob Dylan, and his muscular rendition of &quot;Chimes&quot; is nothing less than majestic. <br />His powerful baritone voice is at the very forefront of the mix, and he sings the first two verses accompained only by piano and synthesizer, before drummer Max Weinberg comes in at the beginning of verse three.<BR>It's still Springsteen driving the song along, though. The drums seem to be trying to keep up with him all through the next four verses, and they finally give up and fall silent for verses seven and eight, only to reappear as the song winds down.<br />Finally we are treated to an acoustic, Dylan-esque version &quot;Born To Run&quot;, harp and everything. And like Dylan, Springsteen significantly alters the melody, making the song moodier, darker, more pessimistic. <br />This is a fine concert souvenir. Not an absolutely essential purchase, perhaps, but an enjoyable one nonetheless, and impressive for as long as it lasts.
B00008H2LB|3.0|I am a fan of all types of music and Linkin Park clearly caught my ear due to their popular music out last year...I was a fan b4 their debut album went Platinum.  A freind suggested \\"Hybrid Theory\\" which I listened to HEAVILY and memorized every base, riff and vocal on the album...I got tired of the album but it remains a classic in Rock history...<BR>I highly anticipated their sophmore effort and bought their remix \\"REanimation\\" disc the first day it arrived in stores, which is done excellent...Jennifer Lopez, P. Diddy and Linkin Park are the only successful artists I know having success with the remix albums unlike other successful artists such as Mary J. Blige, Destiny's Child and LImp Bizkit, who failed with their remix albums...<br />Once I heard \\"Somewhere I belong\\" I figured they would keep the same \\"sound\\" for their sophmore effort. NOt a bad move...and they failed to experiment very little in the entire album...<br />I was somewhat dissappointed regarding the tracks and the entire album. Stand out tracks include the first single, Dont STay, Numb, Sessions, Easier to run,  Faint and Breaking the Habbit...<br />The 36 min quality album wasnt expected due to their popular success with their debut. dont get me wrong, Quality is good, but please add more QUANTITY!!!! Guess they didnt wanna be like Shaggy, selling millions with one album and selling practically nothing with the next, but Linkin Park is a band here to stay, they shoulda had longer tracks. When I just get into a track, it's over too fast. MOre tracks coulda been added for at least 45 min of total quality music...but whatever...<br />The rest of the disc lacks luster and doesnt shine as bright as their debut, but I have faith they'll do better on their third album, which is always an interesting transition and growth for all artists..
B00008PW3Q|5.0|I'll admit I wasn't expecting much from Fleetwood Mac on their return with this album, with the exception of Stevie Nicks-(her 2001 solo album Trouble In Shangri-La IMO is her best album to date), the rest of the group proved me wrong with this album, this album is amazing especially the title track and the first single Peacekeeper, younger acts should take a lesson from FM, even without Christine McVie this album really shines.  Of course, with every FM album there are experimental tracks on the album, most of them are good, I just don't think Red Rover is the best track they have done, but that doesn't really hurt the overall power of this album.  Highly recommended!!!!
B00002E23E|4.0|What can one say about live Zeppelin? They were unmatched. (And still are.) Besides being the only official film of their live show, I think it is a great performance! Frankily, I don't understand when people say that this was a so-so performance; I think it's outstanding! The DVD version is different from the VHS version in the following ways: It was very nice to see extended scenes in the \\"Mob Rubout\\" chapter and some better editing overall. Of course, the picture and audio quality are far superior than the VHS version also. My main gripe about this DVD is that the \\"Widescreen\\" is totally fake! What I mean by this is that all they did was put black bars over the same picture in the VHS version. (I compared them side-by-side.) True Widescreen is when you get extra picture on both sides and the shot is shrunk down to fit the TV. So really what we're getting here is the top and bottom of the picture cut off! What an insult! I don't think most people would notice this, however, so I can really only subtract 1 star for this must-have Zep DVD!
B00008PW3Q|3.0|I gave this album 3 stars mostly out of respect for the band and for the fact that any album that contains the haunting voice of Stevie Nicks can't be all bad. Having said that, there really is some bad stuff in this release. Most of these moments occur when Lindsey Buckingham is allowed to go off and make music that should be on a solo project and never on a Fleetwood Mac album!&quot;Murrow Turning Over In His Grave&quot; is just one example of too many songs that are stuck in between some very decent material. Tracks like &quot;Whats the World Coming To&quot;,&quot;Bleed to Love Her&quot; and the title track are more of what we have come to expect from Fleetwood Mac. I realize that every Mac album has some of LB's crazier moments but they tend to take over with this album. One has to wonder if Christine McVie not only provided some great vocals in the past but also was instrumental in keeping the band headed in the right direction. Lets hope Christine returns for any future projects. If You must own everything that FM puts out then buy this album. If you don't want to be disappointed then pull put a copy of &quot;Rumours&quot; or the self titled album and enjoy some classic Fleetwood Mac.
B000000W5H|3.0|Journalist Nick Kent once pointed out that early on the Stones were tauted as \\"Not just a band, but a way of life.\\"  On their '69 tour they lowered this credo to \\"The World's Greatest Rock and Roll Band\\".  With this album it was diminished to \\"it's only rock and roll\\".<br />Of all the Stones albums, this may be the least interesting.  Which is not to say it's their worst or that the songs are bad, just that the album lacks a truly cohesive personality and any real inspiration throughout.  This was the period where the creative and personal schisms between the Stones - Mick's jet set lifestyle, Keith's drug dependence - became such a issue that it seemed either the Stones were due to breakup or Keith would OD any day now (\\"I was number one on that chart longer than I ever was on the albums!\\", Keith once joked).<br />The songs are good, but you can almost hear Mick wanting to get back to the disco, and Keith was content to exert himself less and less.  So much so that the album's most enjoyable and most inspired performances are a cover (Ain't Too Proud to Beg) and a throwaway (the My Dingaling-esque Short and Curlies).  A number of the tracks show potential that never gets fully realized - If You Can't Roick Me, Till The Next Goodbye, Luxury - and there's a couple that they should have had the good sense to leave off the album altogether - Dance Little Sister.<br />And what of Time Waits for No One?  The song features a great, extended guitar solo from Mick Taylor.  But the Stones appeal has always been the songs and the interaction within the band, not virtuoso performances.  The fact that Taylor had such a spotlight is just another display that Keith was just not putting his own greatest efforts into the album.<br />The title track and Fingerprint File are the best, most pleasing things on here.  We all know the title track, but the lesser known Fingerprint File is a classic, featuring Mick's most foreboding, scary lyrics since \\"Gimme Shelter\\".  <br />So what to do?  Borrow a copy, find the songs you like most from this and Goat's Head Soup, and burn yourself a disc featuring your favorite songs from each album.  You'll have one less disc filling up your library, and you'll omit a lot of the staler, less inspired moments that unfortunatelty are readily available.  It may only be rock and roll, but that shouldn't mean it can't also be a way of life.

B00007L4MJ|5.0|Fritz Lang's Metropolis has been one of the most abused films of all time.  Immediately after its debut in 1927, about a quarter of the film's reels were removed (and lost).  Since then, the film has been re-edited multiple times, to the point that some earlier editions were more or less incoherent.<br />The story of Metropolis is a bit simple and  bit convoluted at the same time, but more or less it is about the battle of the individual against a monolithic, totalitarian technological future.  I suspect the original plot was meant as a metaphor for industrial labor and social unrest in the 1920's.  In this way, Metropolis is a battle of the individual against the excesses of the industrial revolution.<br />That said, the real reason the film has endured despite multiple mutilations is that incredibly innovative film making.  The film was state of the art, and indeed has been a foundation for many modern science fiction films since.  In this regard, it is perhaps the real triumph of 1920's German Expressionist cinema.<br />The Kino release dvd is a real treat.  The restoration is near perfect, much better than I expected.  The film looks like a retored film from the 1950's, not from the 1920's.  Germany's F.W. Murnau Foundation, the people responsible for the restoration, went frame by frame and restored the film to as close to its original as possible.  Of course, many sequences are still missing, possibly forever.  To solve this problem, intertitles were inserted to describe the missing plot sequences.  Finally, the film is coherent.<br />There is some dispute as to the running time of the film.  Running time is listed as 124 minutes but is in fact 118.  The German release of the film IS 124 minutes, and most of the material I have read states that this is the correct running time.  The Kino disk has a frame rate slightly higher than it should be, and the result is that a few scenes do look like the motion is too fast.  As I said, there is some debate about this...  I have heard also that Kino has the correct frame rate.  That being said, most of the material disputes this.<br />In any case, the Kino editon is the best the film has looked in years, and certainly the most coherent edition any of us have probably seen.  Great care has been taken to restore both the physical condition of the picture and the plot line, and the result is spectacular.  Metropolis was state of the art film making at its best, and it still impresses.
8439701039|5.0|There is something special about Gabriel Garcia Marquez' novels and short stories. Its something magic that wont let you put the book aside until you finish it. This is what happened when I read these short stories, so skilfully and wonderfully written.<br />The book has a short introduction about the mission of the writer in this world, about how fragile inspiration is and how quickly stories can be changed, characters' destinies having a different ending. And how many years it takes to write something valuable.<br />I wont write here about the topics of his stories, but I will say that you will love every character and story, as they are very well described, complex, each and everyone having something outstanding. They are normal people, aparently living their lives in our world but in reality living in an universe created by themselves. These stories are not about action and plot, but about different personalities, everyone with his fascinating story that will take into a magical world.<br />Dont read this book on a train or bus or airplane. Take your time to enjoy it at home or in a quiet and peaceful garden. Reading Garcia Marquz and enjoying his books requires a certain atmosphere around you. Thus you make sure you wont miss any of the wonderful moments he creates in the book.
0688163173|5.0|In 1954, US Marshals Teddy Daniels and his new partner, just in from Seattle, Chuck Aule take the ferry from the Massachusetts mainland to Shutter Island where Ashecliffe Hospital for the Criminally Insane dominates the landscape.  The law enforcement officials are assigned to investigate the disappearance of a convict (patient to Dr. Cawley) Rachel Solando, the Berkshire killer of three children she first drowned then \\"shared\\" breakfast with them in her kitchen.<br />Teddy and Chuck wonder how the woman could escape from a locked room on the third floor with guards all over the place and no hideaways on the island itself and swimming the distance to the nearest land in the treacherous Atlantic seems monumental.  A hurricane is coming, which when it hits will totally isolate the island from the mainland.  They begin to find evidence of illegal drug therapy and surgery, but little about the vanished Rachel.  As they uncover more proof of wrongdoing Teddy and Chuck wonder if they will get off the island alive.<br />Highly regarded Dennis Lehane may have written the best police procedural and thriller of the year.  Plenty of action, several mysteries that feels like a Moebius string as each sub-mystery seems inside one another, and strong characterization including flashbacks to Teddy's tragically deceased spouse make for a great read.  On top of a powerful story line with a deep cast and a feel for how society dealt with mental illness during the early Eisenhower red scare era, the climax is as good as a novel gets.  If a reader can afford one book, SHUTTER ISLAND is a terrific choice.<br />Harriet Klausner
0316666343|3.0|Alice Sebold&#8217;s first novel uses an unusual narrative foil that gives voice to the teenage victim of a brutal murder as she looks down on the world from her own private heaven. How each character touched by Susie Salmon's life and death copes with their loss in the years that follow is the book&#8217;s core concern. The event of Susie's murder or the incompetent and fruitless search by the police to find her killer is less important in the novel than their effect on the living. The break up of her parents&#8217; marriage and obsession of her father to find her killer are bitter pills sugared by the perspective of the murdered little girl observing all from the literary hook of a celestial gazebo in a sketchy heavenly garden. Not a ghost story, not a murder mystery but a perhaps too shallow tableau of  how grief damages lives and how ultimately those devastated by loss find ways and strength to deal with and overcome it. Susie&#8217;s view from heaven of lives and loves that for her will never be are vicariously experienced through her family and friends.  A soft read on a black subject matter whose gravitas is more Acron Ohio Housewives&#8217; Creative Writing Class than  epic Russian novel Ms Sebold nonetheless manages to bring forth tears and a lump in the throat in certain passages, which for any composer is a high five &#8220;yes&#8221; for an effect achieved.  The extensive production guest list of helpers and advisors acknowledged at the end of the book perhaps over-gilds the lily by suggesting that the prose was honed with help from the California literary set rather than plucked and fashioned from the author&#8217;s solitary feminine pathos, but packaging and faux Oscar acceptance speeches aside, this first novel deserves a respectable place somewhere on the bookshelf of quaint reads with a Kleenex advisory;  which Ms Sebold&#8217;s publisher will no doubt be grateful for.
B00005JLD4|5.0|Director Phillip Noyce has succeeded in creating a cinematic version of the true book about the 'racial cleansing' of the Australian Aborigines that took part in the first half of the 20th Century.  The Australian government subsidized campsites to where half caste Aboriginal girls would be sent to breed with white men and thus diminish the ethnic qualities of the 'backward natives'. In three genrations the half castes could produce dilution of the 'blackness' of their people by creating half castes > camaroons > octaroons who would have at least the physical characteristics of whites.  This horid bit of history is brought to light by director Noyce in a sophisticated, straight forward, very tender rendering of the escape of three sisters by following the course of the rabbit-proof fence extending from their displacemnet camp in Northern Australia to their home 1500 miles to the South.  Most of the film dwells on the odyssey of Molly, Gracie, and Daisy as they stalwartly defy desert, hunger, fear and the trackers to reach their home.  Noyce wisely uses three inordinately fine young  Aboriginal girls to play the key roles. The evil incarnate Kenneth Branaugh summarizes the Australian government plan, and the remainder of the cast is uniformly excellent.  Photographed in a tone that suggests the bleak wildness of the Australian desert, this little film is a monument to the indefatigable spirit and soul of the Aborigines, and as such this film stands as an important document in the studies about human rights.  Beautifull made with touching simplicity, RABBIT-PROOF FENCE is a film that will enhance your knowledge while nurturing your spirit.  Highly Recommended.
B00006690G|5.0|Eminem came into the game with a bang, and judging by this streak of quality work, he's gonna leave with one too. A few years ago, his debut LP, \\"The Slim Shady LP\\", showed us a party-happy and somewhat depressed Mathers. A year later, \\"The Marshall Mathers LP\\" hit us with the dark side of this man. And most recently, this \\"The Eminem Show\\" will have us viewing Eminem's revived and content state.<br />As with his past 2 CD's, this disc is quality all the way through. It starts off with \\"White America\\", a hard hitting serious track about the way the country is being lead. The flow and beat of this is slow and introduces us to Eminem's improved vocals. After this track, the CD follows with: \\"Business\\", Produced by Dr. Dre himself, \\"Squaredance\\", a diss to Canibus, and \\"Without Me\\", the album's first single and upbeat party theme. On track 12, Eminem shows us some old-school Mathers 'sounding flows with \\"Sing For The Moment\\", sampling Aerosmith's \\"Dream On\\" beat. The following tracks on the CD are all very good, with \\"Superman\\" (the 3rd single) and \\"Till I Collapse\\", a fierce song featuring Nate Dogg, probably at the top of the list.<br />Although I believe this CD ranks slightly below The Marshall Mathers LP, and just slightly above The Slim Shady LP, it's still a masterpiece. I've been an Eminem fan for a long time and even if not quite my favorite work of his, I can easily say these songs are the most professional and most clever cuts he has ever put out. No hip hop fan has a complete collection without this album in their rack!<br />Song Ratings:<br />White America: 9.3 / 10<br />Business: 9.2 / 10<br />Cleaning Out My Closet: 9.0 / 10<br />Squaredance: 9.3 / 10<br />Soldier: 8.9 / 10<br />Say Goodbye Hollywood: 9.2 / 10<br />Drips: 8.4 / 10<br />Without Me: 9.2 / 10<br />Sing For The Moment: 9.4 / 10<br />Superman: 9.6 / 10<br />Hailies Song: 9.4 / 10<br />When The Music Stops: 9.0 / 10<br />Till I Collapse: 9.5 / 100<br />My Dads Gone Crazy: 9.0 / 10<br />OVERALL RATING: 9.4 / 10
B00008PW3O|3.0|First thing - I am reviewing the Limited Edition CD.<br />I would suggest getting the standard issue CD.  I do not believe the limited edition/enhanced CD is worth the extra money.  The four additional songs are ok - but two are just live versions of material on the regular CD.  The pictures and video clips can be or were part of their official website - so there was nothing new. The packaging is ok, but I will say that I find it annoying that though the additional players on the disk are listed, they are not specified to what song. (Ok, I'm pretty sure Christine McVie's only appearance is on \\"Bleed To Love Her\\" which was recorded back in 1997 and the impetus for getting the band back together.)<br />Overall, the material is solid - but nothing outstanding. Fleetwood Mac peaked between 1975-1980.  \\"Mirage\\" and \\"Tango In The Night\\" had good material too (too glossy; too pop), but nothing as memorable as on 'Fleetwood Mac', 'Rumours' or 'Tusk'.<br />It's easy to see why \\"Peacekeeper\\" is the lead single.  It is one of the most accessible songs.  There are others though - Buckingham's \\"Steal Your Heart Away\\" and \\"What's The World Coming To\\" and Stevie Nicks' title song,  \\"Smile At You\\", \\" \\"Thrown Down\\" (though this song sounds reminiscent of \\"No Questions Asked\\" for their 'Greatest Hits' CD),<br />There is a lot of  'ok' music - but that's it.  For Buckingham's quirkiness, he clearly adapted solo work into a group effort - but they're not a band effort (\\"Come\\", \\"Murrow Turning Over In His Grave\\"). There are more elements from his mid-80s solo albums than anything he did with Fleetwood Mac - including 'Tusk'.  Nicks' work has a bit more variety - which does say something for her.  Much of her solo work bordered on plagiarizing herself.  But \\"Running Through the Garden\\", \\"Everybody Finds Out\\" and to  a point, \\"Destiny Rules\\" show real growth.  She has also always benefited from Buckingham's arrangement and production.<br />Christine McVie is sorely missed.  I think a third singer/songwriter really balanced both Buckingham and Nicks. The album probably didn't need to be 18 songs long and they may have benefited from it being stripped down a bit to make the stronger material really stand out. But figuring that there might not be another album for another 5-10 years, I guess you take what you can get.<br />On the bonus CD I will say this - one thing I've always liked about Fleetwood Mac is that they sound live he same way they do on record. Their sound is not all studio produced. \\"Peacekeeper\\" and \\"Say You Will\\" sound pretty much the way they do on the studio CD.  The two bonus tracks Nicks' \\"Not Make Believe\\" and a Dylan cover, \\"Love Minus Zero\\", are fine - but they add or subtract nothing from the overall album.hird singer/songwriter really balanced both Buckingham and Nicks.

0887306667|3.0|This is my very first marketing book. I am a graphic designer & from an artistic &/or plain old 'reading' perspective I would have never picked up such a book - but it was recommended to me by the management. Upon reading 'The 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing' I did find my mind spinning about - thinking of the concepts - opening up inside. I found the book to be a bit smutty & 'right there'. Many of the chapters seemed to loop around & repeat each other conceptually [ a bit distracting ]. Sometimes the whole 'grammar' thing seemed to take second tier to the overall content of the book [ not entirely bad if they are targeting those people reading for surface info - for the lowbrow & obvious   but i am looking for something a bit deeper if anyone can recommend something a bit richer for the next marketing read ].
B000005ITX|5.0|The reason I'm writing this review is because it's necesary for those of you who ever liked rock and roll. Don't expect Page's mind-boggling guitar playing. Just realize: Any person who loves good music and has a collection of classic rock,(The Beatles, Pink Floyd, Simon & Garfunkel, The Band, etc) will \\"Love\\" it. It's simplistic, and beatiful. The notes, lyrics, and songs on this masterpiece are placed just right. <br />They never toured. They were based in the L.A. area. 1967..... Arthur Lee (Brilliant singer/songwriter) created this gem all the while thinking his life was going to end at 26, just a few years down the road. You can imagine the passion put into this work. <br />I rank this album up there with Dark Side of The Moon, and Abbey Road. <br />P.S. It took a few listenings to fall in \\"Love\\" with it, and when I did, I fell HARD.....Peace
B000001F9N|5.0|Let a very young Donna Summer take you on a sensual listening journey. This album/cd makes you want more. What a voice! Sure she holds back ( isnt that so typical Donna Summer) but  doesn^t her holding back leave you wanting more and more? If you listen to this cd you will feel like you are listening to an extremely sophisticated recording artist and chief musician (Georgio Moroder)as they care more about the actual song than they do about being noticed! True artists! The beat alone is enough to make anyone in the room (or in the car) quiet down and wonder who is behind this different yet so satisfying rhythm and sound ... You cant help but realize that Donna et al are way ahead of their time. Focus on Donna and her backup singers singing ^I know^... Low and sexy....this cannont be matched>>so simple yet so catchy and to the actual nerve!! Go Donna! If you ever wondered why or how the commercial Donna got as far as she did ,just listen to this early girl (1976!!!) and you will know the true definition of [] D I V A
0345448898|5.0|A friend recommended \\"His Dark Materials\\" to me during a discussion of books we loved as children and teenagers -- the ones that we still enjoy. So far I've read them twice and given them as gifts to several more friends. Pullman has an astounding imagination and is a very, very gifted writer. If I were a writer, this is the kind of book I'd want to write. By the end of the third book, I felt the characters were close personal friends whose company I was about to lose -- so I went back and immersed myself in their world again.<br />I'm not sure I would recommend this series for children; it's intelligent and enthralling, and the main characters are pre-teens (just), but some kids are going to find it too much. I think it depends very much on the individual child; my brothers read \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" around age nine, while I didn't get into it until adolescence, and this might require the same kind of judgement call. But kids who are ready are going to be swept away -- there are no punches pulled, no dumbing down, and the young protagonists are fully fleshed-out and incredibly vivid people.<br />I am a fan of SF and fantasy, but I'm not sure you have to be to like these books; the issues they deal with are much more complex and transcendent.
B00005OAIE|4.0|This is a great \\"pop\\" album.<br />I've heard the best of the best, from the Beatles to Fleetwood Mac and Jackson Browne, and this is without a doubt, one of the better pop albums to come from a male artist in the last decade or so. <br />Comparisions to Dave Matthews aside for the tripe they are, this young man knows how to write a song. From the catchy \\"hooks,\\" to the strong musicmanship and guitar work. My only complaint is that lyrical content is a bit ego-centric. But hey...I bet they said the same thing about Dylan, too. <br />Time will tell if John Mayer is here to stay. Until then, enjoy his extraordinary talent and stop the inane comparisons. There's room on this planet for both Dave and John.
0385504209|4.0|This book reaches out, grabs a hold of you and doesn't let go.  The author dug deep and did his homework.  He even tells you in the Prolouge what FACTS are contained in his fictional work.<br />One reviewer on Amazon says the anti religuos people will like it.  I don't now how he got there.  This isn't a historical account it's a great fictional story.  The details are superb and the author writes in a style that allows the reader to instantly visualize the characters and the settings.<br />You do have to pay attention the details are many but never cumbersome. This is a great book for the beach or a quiet room where you can start and stay with it for several chapters at a time.  I've never ead Dan Brown before but I will again!
B000089RVX|4.0|This is definetly a good album and worth listening to many times. BUT! Lacuna Coil from Italy does the same thing since 1996. When I first heard the song Bring me to life I thought it was them! Anyway, it is sad to see that being backed by a major label a band is instantly succesful while others doing the same thing have to work for years.<br />Now enough of my complaints. Evanescene certainly deserves the good ratings because this is a top class album. Personally I'm a great fan of combined male &amp; femal voices. It give's the music a great atmosphere &amp; melanchony. Very good.
B000005DQR|5.0|When I think of all diferent kinds of music and how they could possibly be mixed together in a massive album, I think of this one.<br />The whole album (as you've already read) is compiled of hard to find records that only a select few in this world have heard. This album has everything: Soul, hard hitting smashing good hip hop beats, ambience, and the list goes on. The music is groovy, but at the same time it rocks. Every single melody on it is perfectly mastered. Delicious!!<br />A lot of music out (mainly today) is made for one purpose: \\"It's the money.\\" This however is a work of art. Passion was put into this baby, and a lot of it. <br />A final thought: If you think you must listen to lyrics when you here music to \\"relate\\" to a song, but you like classical music, don't knock this before you try it. It's veerry tasty. Without a doubt, #1 album of the 90's.<br />P.S.I also recemend ALL other DJ Shadow titles.
B00000JS1M|4.0|When Saxon released \\"Power and the glory\\" they were still on top. This album is very good and not far behind the excellent \\"Denim and leather\\" or \\"Strong arm of the law\\". In my opinion, Biff Byford and the boys have always been dedicated hard working rockers although the hunger for success (i.e. to break into America) made their judgement questionable for a time, something you easily can hear on albums like \\"Destiny\\". But when Saxon recorded \\"Power and the glory\\" back in 1983 they stayed musically close to their roots. I think almost every single track is great with exception of the closing \\"The eagle has landed\\". If you like traditional heavy metal I think you'll be very pleased with \\"Power and the glory\\". Very close to 5 stars!

She must find friends who will help her to navigate this world of witches, spirits and monsters in order to return her parents to their human form and return to the human world herself.<br /><br />&#34;Spirited Away&#34; is directed by renowned Japanimation director Hayo Miyazaki. And it deservedly won the 2003 Academy Award for Best Animated Feature. This film is better than anything I have seen Disney produce (Pixar films excepted).  It is simply more imaginative and engaging. And it won't bore the adults or older children in the audience. This is a good film to rent or buy if, as much as you would like to watch a movie with your young children, you can't help dreading it.  &#34;Spirited Away&#34;  isn't highbrow, but it won't make you groan either. And it's not a musical, so there are no insipid songs that you won't be able to get out of your head for weeks.
1881273156|5.0|My hubby and I have had a rough patch; as relatively newlyweds, we were really struggling. Most of our arguments revolved around our different expressions of love - I naturally do what makes me happy; what I want my husband to do. He gives to me what he wanted me to give him ... but both of us were left feeling unfulfilled and like the other wasn't listening.  After reading this book, we both agree we were expressing different love languages.  <br />As we learn to give in the language the other partner can best receive, this has made a lot of difference and improved our marriage satisfaction and intimacy.  The book is easy to read and is such a simple concept! I am giving this to all of my newly married friends as well as a copy to my parents. I highly recommend it - practiced faithfully, I believe it can positively impact a relationship!

0790729628|4.0|So much has been said about this film it has almost become a \\"fabled\\" movie.  I just watched the \\"Directors Cut\\" (the only cut available)last night (having only seen the original version many years ago and at the theater). I had heard so many things about this version, yet never anything specific.  It turned out to be nothing that I had expected.  Here's what went through my mind; (if you've never seen this film, beware of spoiler stuff!!)<br />-I remembered the original being a bit more exciting...  ...I think?<br />-The lack of narration had little effect on my opinion of the film.  It did seam a little \\"lonelier\\"...  ...I think??<br />-Harrison Ford sure looks young!!  He really didn't need to act much.<br />-I had forgotten how \\"Asian\\" L.A. had become in this film.  Not sure why this is our future?<br />-Could not get over the fact that this film takes place 20 years from now.  Doubtful L.A. will look like this in 20 years.  I would have picked a date most of the viewers would not live to, like 2100.  That's just me...<br />-I had heard that Ford's character dies in this version.  I kept waiting for that...<br />-Some say he is a replicant and will die soon.  OK??  I'm going to need some help with that one.  It was not apparent to me (Though intriguing).<br />-I guess they imply that the \\"Unicorn dream\\" was implanted, at the end.  THAT'S REALLY SUBTLE!!  But I get it.<br />-If he is a replicant, I really don't have much reason to care for him.  And why isn't he stronger?<br />-Given all this, I like the original better... ...I think?<br />You see, my biggest problem is my memories of the original are fading.  I really think there is something wrong with that.  When I first saw this film in the theater, I thought it was outstanding.  Now I see the Directors Cut and think it's OK.  It actually moved a little slow for me.  If I could just have a clear point of reference/comparison.  I'm a little upset that the choice has been denied me.  Why is it that both versions were not released together?  Now that would be great!!<br />I haven't said much about the DVD itself.  Eh.  It is an old DVD.  NO extras at all.

0060537639|5.0|In 1492 Columbus sailed the ocean in search of new land. This is what westernized history would have us believe.  Gavin Menzies, a retired Royal Navy Submarine commanding officer and amateur historian, is the author of the book, \\"1421: The year China discovered the world.\\" Menzies writes about a history that only a few individuals have heard of. In the novel 1421 it is stated that the largest fleet the world had ever seen sailed from China. The Emperor of China and his fleet journeyed across the Indian Ocean to discover new land and were the first to colonize and inhabit North America. Admiral Zheng, who served under several powerful Chinese emperors, commanded this journey using star charts. This book contains compelling evidence that Chinese explorers were able to solve the problem of longitude long before Western seafarers. Artifacts of the Chinese voyage have been discovered all around the coastal areas of North and South America. Zheng and his Chinese fleet not only discovered America 72 years before Columbus but also colonized the new world. Menzies' controversial book is fascinating. His theory that the Chinese had discovered North America before Columbus will appeal to historical conservatives and skeptics alike. One possible area for concern in regards to Menzies' theory is that western scholars will require incontrovertible proof to support his claim. The claim that China predated Columbus' voyage to the America is truly interesting.  Despite some shortcomings, Menzies' book offers an interesting read, one that will satisfy inquiring minds and historians alike.

B00004ZAV3|3.0|While I must say that the music on Beatles 1 is perfect pop, the song selection and the idea of only including number one hits is baffling and paints a very incomplete picture.<BR>True, compiling a single disc compilation of the best of the Beatles is really difficult (I managed to compile a huge compilation I plan to piece together on a CD-R one day...but it's 62 songs long!), i don't entirely understand why they couldn't stick this on two CDs. Would've still have been a great value. <BR>I find it downright perverse not to include 'Strawberry Fields Forever' (my favorite Beatles song) but to include it's single companion, 'Penny Lane'. Those two songs exist together, not seperate. And no 'Please Please Me'? Simply because it only went to number one in Britain? I don't get that. But then, it's dumb to include just number ones anyway; many Beatles album tracks are essential to understanding them (i.e., 'Norwegian Wood', 'Nowhere Man', 'A Day In The Life', [actually Beatles 1 doesn't include ANY songs from Sgt. Pepper, since th Beatles refused to release any of its tracks as singles], etc). For those who want a great overview of the Beatles career, get the Red (1962-1966) and Blue (1967-1970) compilation double albums. Sure, more expensive, but the Beatles are worth it.<BR>However, the best thing about the Beatles 1 disc is that it might just end up to be the first step in a person who's new to the Beatles in understanding and appreciating them. Perhaps it'll lead them to buy all the original albums, which of course remains the most essential listening of all.

The added &quot;Bleed for your Love&quot; from the Dance CD is a nice touch. Some of other tracks are really bizarre. Guess they were experimenting with art. I think they could have condensed this CD from 18 songs to 10 and had an awesome CD.  Others, you will have to hit the skip button.<br />All in all, it is worth the purchase.

This time around, she's trying to locate a young American man missing in Botswana for ten years, nobody knows if he's still alive; dealing with the expansion of her household by the acquistion of two foster children her fiance, Mr. JLB Matekoni, was tripped into taking before he knew which end was up; investigating the evil machinations of Mr. JLB's housekeeper, and giving her secretary, Mma Makutsi, a well-deserved promotion to assistant detective.<br />As in the first book, Mma Ramotswe shares star billing with Africa itself, and in her we see the values that mean so much in this vibrant, diverse continent: the attachment to the land, the all-important love of family and neighborhood, the ethic of sharing one's good fortune with those less fortunate, and the homespun common-sense that motivates her daily activities.  She's not so much about solving crimes as she is about maintaining the harmony of an orderly existence.  For this reason, I don't consider this book or its predecessor as \\"crime novels\\".  Alexander McCall Smith isn't a crime writer; he's much more interested in Mma Ramotswe as a personality, and once again he's given us a quintessentially African protagonist in a quintessentially African book.
0060537639|5.0|In 1492 Columbus sailed the ocean in search of new land. This is what westernized history would have us believe.  Gavin Menzies, a retired Royal Navy Submarine commanding officer and amateur historian, is the author of the book, \\"1421: The year China discovered the world.\\" Menzies writes about a history that only a few individuals have heard of. In the novel 1421 it is stated that the largest fleet the world had ever seen sailed from China. The Emperor of China and his fleet journeyed across the Indian Ocean to discover new land and were the first to colonize and inhabit North America. Admiral Zheng, who served under several powerful Chinese emperors, commanded this journey using star charts. This book contains compelling evidence that Chinese explorers were able to solve the problem of longitude long before Western seafarers. Artifacts of the Chinese voyage have been discovered all around the coastal areas of North and South America. Zheng and his Chinese fleet not only discovered America 72 years before Columbus but also colonized the new world. Menzies' controversial book is fascinating. His theory that the Chinese had discovered North America before Columbus will appeal to historical conservatives and skeptics alike. One possible area for concern in regards to Menzies' theory is that western scholars will require incontrovertible proof to support his claim. The claim that China predated Columbus' voyage to the America is truly interesting.  Despite some shortcomings, Menzies' book offers an interesting read, one that will satisfy inquiring minds and historians alike.
B00007LL7O|4.0|When I bought this album, I was surprised because the music is very different than the previous albums. It is clearly seen that there are lots of orchestration performed in this album. Might be Stratovarius is trying to do something new. In my opinion, they successfully mix the orchestration with their original type of music, but I think this album doesn't have as much power than the other albums before. This is a good album if you are a real fan of Stratovarius, but I would rather enjoy albums like Visions or Destiny rather than this one.
6304082428|4.0|What is it that brings Darcy and Lizzy together?  Not sexual attraction, apparently, there isn't any.  This sham romance undermines a beautifully crafted film brought to us by the BBC.<br />Glorious cinematography presents the English countryside, lovely homes, and exquisite costumes of this period drama to advantage.  In the VHS version, the sunlight is often too bright and the coloring is sometimes off, green piano keys for example.  Perhaps this is due to poor film quality because of a low budget.<br />Great editing techniques are used to lead the audience to different locations and time periods.  The score and sound effects are also noteworthy.  Classical music adds emotional depth to several scenes.<br />The screenplay is based on Jane Austen's most popular novel.  There is little deviation from the plot of the book, but the dialogue is less subtle.  For example, in the film Charlotte says that on some days she sees her (irksome) husband for only a few minutes.  Jane Austen's character has too much discretion to say this; in the original story this information is inferred by Eliza.<br />The acting is sometimes overly sentimental but usually of fine quality.  A list of the best performers would include Barbara Leigh-Hunt (Lady Catherine de Bourgh), David Bamber (Mr. Collins), Lucy Scott (Charlotte), Julia Sawalha (Lydia), Alison Steadman (Mrs. Bennet), Crispin Bonham-Carter (Mr. Bingley), and Anna Chancellor (Miss Bingley). <br />Jennifer Ehle's performance is not bad, just annoying.  Most of the time she appears to be on the verge of tears for no apparent reason.  Her only resemblance to standard romance heroines is a pretty face and figure.<br />And Darcy is an unusual romance hero as well.  Colin Firth portrays him as a feral young man almost totally lacking in social grace.  In the beginning, Mr. Darcy acts very weird, which may be an attempt to look intense; this is especially noticeable during the first ball in Hertfordshire.  Whether the director or the actor is at fault is not clear.  He becomes more human-like over time, which is wonderful to see, especially in the end when he and Lizzy begin to relate well, like old friends.<br />It's interesting that though most characters in the film resemble their corresponding characters in the novel, the lead man and woman differ radically from the hero and heroine of the book.  Ehle's pouty, sentimental, self-satisfied Eliza Bennet is very different from Austen's sharp, classy, devil-may-care heroine.  And the queer, nervous Mr. Darcy in this movie is the complete opposite of the calm, strong, fatherly Mr. Darcy in the novel.<br />This does not matter, however, because the screenplay, though of high importance, is merely one of many elements which combine to form the final product - a movie.  This is a romance movie, and we expect a romance.  Not just lover's dialogue, sweet music, bared breast and muscle, but the thing itself: apparent sexual chemistry between the lead actor and lead actress.  Alas, that one important element is lacking in this faux romance.

B00005JLZ9|2.0|\\"Basic\\" features one of the great fakeout performances of all time from John Travolta, though it's more deplorable than admirable. If the movie is to be believed, then only the final five minutes feature Travolta's character, DEA agent Tom Hardy, speaking words that could not be considered a con job. Were \\"Basic\\" a David Mamet picture, well now. But it's a military movie about a combat accident, then murder, then drugs, then...nothing. There has to be easier ways to ferret out crooked officers than this.<BR> <BR> Truth be told, the journey in \\"Basic,\\" directed by John McTiernan, is pretty entertaining. A \\"training\\" exercise in the Panamanian jungle goes awry when a soldier (Who? How? When?) murders the sadistic drill instructor, Sgt. West (Samuel L. Jackson). Out of eight soldiers, two survive, neither is talking, and the commanding officer in Panama (Timothy Daly) has an impending image problem. Hardy is a friend called in to assist the on-base investigator (Connie Nielsen) with the predictable butt of heads ensuing.   <br /> A leaner, meaner Travolta has his moments, especially with the first uncooperative solider (Brian Van Holt). The other, wounded soldier is played by Giovanni Ribisi as a mannered, slightly deranged gay man forced to join the military by his general father. Uh huh.<br /> Naturally, the soldiers have alternate stories that implicate one another. Naturally, there's another layer below those stories. And another. And another.  The final layer reveals there were no layers; it's like icing, suspended in air, over a nonexistent cake. You can see how this might not be pleasing. <br /> Movies can be, and often should be, clever. Every so often, movies can even fib a little -- flashbacks, for example, are seen in the eye of beholder, and are not necessarily the actual truth. \\"Basic\\" goes much further into this territory, toward blatant abuse of the audience's trust. Consider a scene where Hardy discovers that one soldier has been using the name of another; the camera zooms in on Hardy, then cuts to several scenes we've already seen in the movie, only with a different soldier in the role of the previous soldier. The way this scene is cut, it's clear these flashbacks are meant to occur in Hardy's mind; thus, he would seem to be putting together the pieces as we are. <br /> But later, \\"Basic\\" reveals Hardy not only had this information, but concealed it. How to explain the previous scene? There is no explanation, beyond the screenwriter, James Vanderbilt, wanting to make the viewer feel like a fool. His clear obsession with a trick ending throws a javelin through the heart of the film.<br /> Judging by the A-list supporting cast -- Jackson, Nielsen, Taye Diggs, Ribisi, Roselyn Sanchez, in a nice turn as a twisted, goofy female grunt  -- \\"Basic\\" had some heft behind it. What a bitter shame it amounted to nothing.

0385507755|4.0|The autobiographical memoir seems to have become the latest trend, mirroring the rise in reality tv (but more intellectual, of course!)  Playing wingmen are the four horseman of modern american writing: hyperbole, sarcasm, understatement and condescension.  Television, newspapers, magazines and books have largely embraced this style of communication.  And reviews are no different.  For once I would like to read a review where the reviewer does not try to boost their own feeble intelligence through the review.  Oh so you know about David Foster Wallace, and you've read Infinite Jest?  What does that possibly have to do with reviewing a book.  So enough time has been wasted....<br />A Million Little Pieces is a good, quick read that explores a life pulling itself out of the maw of oblivion.  Drug use and addiction are devestating on a person's life and all those around him.  What makes this book so entertaining is the degree to which Frey had destroyed his life and how horrific the struggle to reclaim it has been.  There are moments of brutally graphic honesty and unclothed emotion.  But above all the book speaks about strength and weakness - how much punishment the body can take or dish out.  While Frey is the center of the story, it is the people at the clinic, both patients and staff (as well as his parents) that show addiction to have consequences outside one's self. <br />It is more the events of the book that carry it forward than the writing style.  The girls eyes might indeed be \\"arctic blue\\" but it is what those eyes have seen that the reader is more interested in.  <BR>It is the next book Frey writes, when he is without the aid of such intense personal material, that will show whether he is truly gifted as an author.  But for now, this is a story that will not disappoint, and that you are not likely to forget.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|This is the second movie I bought on DVD without seeing it first (after Memento, see my ***** review). <br />Wait a minute! I lied. Not exactly lied, but distorting the truth a little bit - I was reccomended DONNIE DARKO after buying Memento, but it seemed a bit much for my taste - end of the world, time-travel, aliens, giant bunny rabbits - it sounded like an artistic mess David Lynch is capable of delivering combined with a talking animals in clothing (talking chimps come to mind that should be forbidden) - but it intrigued me enough to keep an eye on it.<br />After a few months, I visited a friend I haven't seen a long time and he says: \\"I have something to show you...\\" He plugs in his PC and shows me the beginning of  Donnie Darko. I was struck in awe after an introductory bicycle scene and the decision was made. I made him stop the movie so I can enjoy it with the real 5.1 sound and picture. I ordered it at the amazon the very same day.<br />Upon writing this review, I thought to myself: \\"Rather than telling you what the movie really is about, I'll tell the story of how I came to become a very satisfied owner of it.\\" So, I did that and hope to induce enough intrigue for someone to buy or not to buy the movie. But, in my humble opinion, everyone who considers himself or herself  movie-buff must have this film.<br />I almost forgot! The DVD is loaded with excellent extras, including a whopping 20 deleted or extended scenes with or without commentary, but believe me - after seeing the movie you won't be able to go through that unless your heart is made of stone or you're a Vulcan... Or simply if you're stupid and say: \\"I don't get it.\\" But then, why bother with this? Go buy \\"The Fast and The Furious\\" instead and knock yourself out...

B000021Y7X|5.0|I had only been a casual Talking Heads fan thanks to Burning Down The House, I Zimbra and Cities. When I saw this film for the first time, I was hooked and became something of a fanatic. To this day, I mourn the band's break up.<br />Starting with David Byrne and his guitar, the film opens with Pyscho Killer. This would seem an unlikely choice to start off a concert but Byrne shows the key to putting on a good show is knowing how to draw the audience in, no matter what the material. With each selection, we're introduced to another member of the band and increasingly funky songs. By the time, Bernie Worrell hits the keyboards for Slippery People, you'll be dancing around in your living room.<br />Although Byrne is unquestionably the star of this film, you'll be riveted by the auxillary band members Worrell, percussionist Steve Scales and the back up singers. The show is simple yet builds upon layers to get the audience's attention and keep it. Today's young performers as well as their audience should be required to view this movie to see how a real concert is done.
B000002Q88|3.0|Yeah, this is a total turnaround for Kansas, but<BR>You have to admire their ambition.

Steve<BR>Morse shines; more than he did on &quot;Power&quot; as this album<BR>has more nuance and layers than anything else they've<BR>done.

B00008DDXC|5.0|This was a great movie, yet you don't get the same effect as you do reading the books. You don't get to know the characters well, and there aren't as many witty dialogs between the 3 characters in the movie. Yet, I think they still did a great job on it. It captures the second book good. Daniel, Emma, and Rupert do even a better acting job than the first film. They play their characters outstandingly real. I also think they did a great job on the new characters, like Lockhart, Colin, Lucius, and Ginny. I also think the special effects look great. Dobby, the mandrakes, the pixies, fawkes, and the basilisk look great. The 2nd DVD, which is special features, has hours of exciting features. There's 19 deleted scenes, interviews with all the cast members, and an interview with JK Rowling and the screenwriter, Steve Kloves. Plus, there's fun and exciting games to play. A much better and interesting special features disk than the first movie had! A great addition for your Harry Potter collection. I also highly recommend the Harry Potter books if you like the movies.

0517548232|2.0|I understand the general euphoria over this book.  It is well written, succinct and, in places, an accurate exegesis of free market economics.  In much of the text, Hazlitt artfully debunks incorrect reasoning that often drives economic policy.  Insofar as the book limits itself to that modest goal, it succeeds admirably. But when Hazlett more ambitiously attempts to purvey free market economics as singular truth the book falls painfully short.<br />Hazlitt, like other free market economists, forgets that free market theory is only a pardigm.  Free market thinking is useful to the extent that the conditions precedent to a free market are fulfilled; but no further.  When the assumptions underlying free market thought are not met, the theory may fail.  And in virtually ignoring this fact the book founders.<br />For example, Hazlitt never mentions the problem of externalities which free markets inevitably fail to address.  And his actors always conform to behavior convenient for free market theory.  To paraphrase Garrison Keillor, Hazlett's universe is a paradise where all the markets are strong, all the investments are attractive and all the profits are above average. <br />But there are other failings, too.  The dislocations of a free market economy are generally trivialized. Unemployment is almost viewed as a benefit to workers when resultant from free market operations; as if a pink slip were a toll pass for the Yellow Brick Road leading to the Oz of more efficient employment.  In several places Hazlitt is inconsistent, as when discussing the failure of marginal producers (a benefit when caused by free market processes in declining industries; an evil when caused by \\"excessive\\" wage demands by labor). Remarkably, he adverts to the \\"inappropriate\\" political power wielded by labor and farmers due to their disproportionate numbers, while never mentioning the truly undue influence that corporate largesse has on governing institutions.  What Hazlett considers improper political influence most of us would consider functioning democracy.<br />In summary, this book is a useful and brief introduction to free market economics.  So long as one recognizes its limitations, well . . .no harm, no foul.  But for true economic enlightenment you will have to look elsewhere.

1559409010|4.0|I must say I'm amazed at other reviews that find nothing &quot;sacrilegious&quot; or anti-Christian in &quot;The Life Of Brian.&quot; <br />Now I love the film, I think it's very funny.  But that's because I'm not a Christian, and consider the far-fetched doctrines of this (and all religions) fair game for skewering and lampooning.<br />But if a friend asked me what the tone of this movie was, I would answer honestly: brutally mocking, in-your-face sarcastic, and completely contemptuous of the Christ story. I think Christians who don't see this have missed the point and don't seem to take their own beliefs too seriously. <br />Just imagine if a similar film were made about the life of Mohammed. (As perhaps it should be).  There would be blood in the streets.

B00008PW3O|5.0|First of all the limited edition enhanced cd is amazing, a hard booklet with pages and pages of rare photos, lyrics, fold outs, and a collectible 11x14 poster of a darkroom contact of the band at Lindsey's house recording.<br />It's amazing to see these people getting older, so glad they are all still around, and to hear what they've come up with next.<br />As well, this cd is &quot;enhanced&quot; and when you put it in your computer it pulls up a special page with links to video footage of the band members working out songs, singing, playing, etc. You also get a bonus cd of bonus tracks. The limited edition is a must for any Mac fan who collects.<br />Now on to the music! I'm going to start at the very end of the cd with Stevie's song &quot;Good-bye Baby&quot;. I have been a Stevie fan for many years and I don' think I've ever heard her voice sound more tender than on this song, she sings it as if she's singing a lullabye. I can almost see her quietly leaning in to be careful with her voice, delicate, not to blast someone out of the water with it's power or volume.<br />&quot;What's the world coming to&quot; is a young sounding Lindsey song. I never appreciate Lindsey's influence unless he's gone, he's easy to take for granted. This song is catchy and full of life.<br />On &quot;Murrow turning over in his grave&quot; Lindsey uses his engineering genius. The vocals and guitars on this are very layered and complex. I mostly like how he does the background vocals &quot;ba ba ba ba baaaa&quot; real fast and low with his guitar ticking like a tick tock clock in the background in that unmistakable Lindsey sound/way on he can do. This song almost has a Beetles feel to it, a bit acid rock, a bit pop, then the end turns into a Lindsey jam session of the clearest variety.<br />&quot;Illume 9/11&quot; by Stevie starts off with Lindsey's fantastic acoustic strums then gets layered with his many sounds, you can almost see Mick on the drums keeping this smooth basa nova rhythm, and Stevie weaves in and out all those sounds. John's bass maintains a great dance beat. Ethereal Stevie.<br />&quot;Thrown Down&quot; starts with Lindsey's muffled rapid guitar with an echo, again, only the way Lindsey can produce that sound, the unmistakable Fleetwood Mac guitar sound that so many try to copy but can't. This song resembles &quot;Gypsy&quot; a bit but it's fresh and new. It's fun just to hear Lindsey's guitar and the different sounds they layer. Stevie, the poet of our era does not fail to deliver. Mick's drum lines bore me on this particular song but it works.<br />&quot;Miranda&quot; is Buckingham from the long lost years of Buckingham/Nicks, I swear I hear &quot;sunflowers and your face fascinate me&quot; then I hear his music piece as well as &quot;Stephanie&quot; in his guitar. Mick is livelier on this song. It's interesting how Mick's drums can sound like flat cans and I still like it, then he spikes them up into this deep dark mellow depth of sound. You'll enjoy the varied sounds on this especially the &quot;phone&quot; sound of Stevie and Lindsey singing.<br />Red Rover is classic Lindsey again with his guitar sounding almost like a mandolin, a muffled one, and his voice weaves in and out in that strange way only he knows what he's trying to sound like and the end result is something you like. This song has a very English country side sound to it.<br />&quot;Say You will&quot; of course again is classic Mac. &quot;Something in you brought out something in me, that I've never been since&quot; Stevie writes and sings in a much missed era of 70's acoustic rock sound.<br />I will stop here because I don't want to ruin the rest for anyone.<br />I'm just glad the Mac is still ticking along and that everyone is still writing and singing and creating. I miss Christine, her smooth vocals and keyboards will be missed, but it is fun to see Buckingham/Nicks come full circle in their own special brand of sound they created when they were so young so many years ago, it's still there, very much fresh and new and young.<br />&quot;Go on save yourself, leave the key here, you love someone else, I shouldn't be here&quot; is the Stevie poem I'll end with.ny years ago, it's still there, very much fresh and new and young.<br />&quot;Go on save yourself, leave the key here, you love someone else, I shouldn't be here&quot; is the Stevie poem I'll end with.
B000001EL7|4.0|I really feel that this was KISS' finest moment in the studio. It combined the skillfully slick production of \\"Destroyer\\" with the no holds barred beat on \\"Rock And Roll Over,\\" and got the best from both those albums. It was also deliciously sleazy. After all, isn't a \\"Love Gun\\" the equivalent to a Sex Pistol? From the cover art to the music within, this was KISS at their most flamboyant, decadent, and egotistical.<br />But it also was the turning point for the band's egos. You can see the divisions beginning to form, as Ace gets to sing his first lead on the wonderful \\"Shock Me\\" and Peter's \\"Hooligan\\" is probably the weakest moment on the disc. Gene's personality has become way over the top on \\"Love Gun.\\" Place \\"Almost Human\\" and the leering \\"Christine Sixteen\\" next to each other, and you get a profile of the man's soul that may just creep you out. At the same time, the giddy rush of \\"Christine Sixteen\\" will have you singing along with the not so wonderful sentiments.<br />The album closes on an even more bizarre note. After spending most of the album singing the words \\"my love\\" as a euphemism for his reproductive organ, Paul bursts into a highly romanticized cover of the girl group classic \\"And Then (S)he Kissed Me.\\" Given all the testosterone the guys have excreted during the previous nine songs, it hits like an atom bomb cream pie. And since KISS was allways about being brazen, its a brilliant move.<br />Unfortunately this was also the last album before they really started running out of creative juice. Punk rock was just starting to get a toehold and disco was overwhelming the radio. \\"Love Gun\\" was the last glorious gasp of KISS as the preeminent seventies rock machine, and as a final touchstone for the decade of decadence.
B00008DDSC|4.0|The joy of SECRETARY lies in its characters, all of whom are quirky (to say the least). And if you leave the film thankful that you run with \\"normal\\" folks, then you probably just don't know the person in the adjacent work cube all that well.<br />As the film begins, Lee Holloway (Maggie Gyllenhaal) has just been released from institutional therapy. Lee has a level of self-esteem that's abysmal to the point of involving self-mutilation with sharp objects. (She even has her own first aid kit to disinfect and treat the wounds as soon as she makes them!) And whatever therapy she got didn't stick. But, life goes on, so she takes a typing class, and subsequently lands a job as a SECRETARY for the perfectionist lawyer \\"Mr. Grey\\" (James Spader).<br />Mutual assessment soon reveals potential for an S&M relationship where Grey is the \\"S\\" and Lee the \\"M\\". Courting, so to speak, and foreplay involve the boss making increasingly difficult demands of Lee's job performance with the mutual understanding that the latter will fail and punishment will follow. And what's a poor girl to do when making deliberate spelling errors in legal correspondence just doesn't push Grey's lust button anymore?<br />Spader's Grey persona is so deliciously creepy - not sinister, just creepy - that his paralegal does her work in such an unusual hiding place that she's rarely seen, even by the audience. And the delightful Gyllenhaal's portrayal of Holloway is so otherwise girl-next-door, except for her preoccupation with cutting edges, that I'm now surreptitiously scrutinizing our office secretaries for barely-hidden scars. And Jeremy Davies is terrific as Lee's nominal boyfriend, the painfully pathetic Peter.<br />While SECRETARY was in the theaters, it probably wasn't a film that you would've taken your prim and proper grandmother to see for her day trip away from the assisted care facility. It has some artistically done full-frontal nudity and a couple scenes of X-rated heavy breathing. SECRETARY is a stylish and darkly humorous treatment of a delicate subject that allows the viewer to snicker without the guilty feeling of having been discovered with a dirty magazine. (Of course, if Granny finds it knee-slapping funny, you might want to rethink your assumptions about her younger years.) My only complaint was that the ending is perhaps a little too drawn out and tidy.

The problem with the movie, &quot;Sorcerer's Stone,&quot; was that Columbus failed to add anything that wasn't in the book, making the movie seem flat, and sometimes boring. The special effects were horribly done. You couldn't help looking at Voldemort and not think, &quot;computer animation.&quot;<BR>NOT TRUE HERE. Chamber of Secrets is amazing. The special effects were the best I've seen in a long time, and they are espechily amazing when you look at the creatures. During some of the action scenes, you forget that the things are computer creations. Not only that, but Columbus, this time, adds MORE. The final battle was not RIGHT out of the book like it was in the first movie. The final battle featured many more different things happening, and, in a different order. This made even people who read the book nervous during these scenes, because, since it is not right from the book, you don't know what's going to happen. This movie features a lot of humor, much more than in the Sorcerer's Stone. The action scenes are top-notch, and it makes me wonder why Columbus doesn't make action movies. He knows exactly how to completely surprise those watching the movie. The acting was great. Once again, improved from the Sorcerer's Stone. <br />This movie is not for young kids. While seeing the movie, I noticed that parents around me were grumbling during the intense final battle scene about how upset they were that this movie was not rated PG13. Personally, while I don't think this movie was PG13 material, it does verge on PG13 material. And I think that is necessary. The Harry Potter books are not exactly &quot;Goldilocks and the the Three Bears.&quot; This movie needed thrills, it needed some violence, and it was appropriately added. It is one of the scarriest Harry Potter books made. Critics complain about this film beingtoo intense; Well, wait until they see the 4th movie!<br />My only problems were that many of the deleted scenes really SHOULD have been in the movie, and that the muggle-born issue was not NEARLY as focused on as it was in the book. And the fact that the ending seemed kind of rushed. The ending; one of the biggest problems with the movie. Columbus has a scene at the end of the movie which makes you wonder what he was thinking. First of all, in the book, Hermione did not hug Harry at the end. J.K. Rowling even commented on this (in the interview that's on the DVD) saying that this sort of thing did not happen until the fourth book. Not only that, but.....well, just watch the scene. You can easily tell that it was not in the book.<br />Other than that, this movie is a must-own, and definately puts the first movie to complete shame. Alfonso Cuaron will be directing the 3rd Harry Potter movie. I hope he does as good of a job as Columbus did on this movie.

B000001ELL|3.0|After licking their wounds from the solo disasters, KISS came back with &#34;Dynasty.&#34; But this wasn't really a comeback as much as it was an unstable atom trying hard not to fracture. It kicks off with three rapid fire shots then falls apart quick.<br />&#34;I Was Made For Loving You&#34; was pop disco as only KISS could have imagined it, and compared to most dance tracks fron that era, holds up rather well. Ace's reading of the Stone's &#34;2000 Man&#34; was proably his best moment on record as a singer. Finally, &#34;Sure Know Something&#34; was a great single that somehow got lost in the backlash that had formed around KISS.<br />Unfortunately the rest of the album gasses out from here. History tells us that internal strife and excess was beginning to tear the band apart by now; listening to &#34;Dynasty&#34; with that backstory behind it hints at why the remainder of the record sounds so uninspired. (Great cover though. I had that poster on the wall though college!)

B00006X06U|4.0|To tell you the truth,I did'nt really like my initial hearing of this recording, but I did continue listening and slowly started to appreciate it more and more.I now believe it is among her best work .It does at times feel a bit like her swan song,however it is never too sad.&quot;Song To a Seagull&quot; floors me though.It is Joni's ability to recapture the essence of her older material with a naked stark vision of now that I truly find compelling.......&quot;and the dream of a baby&quot;......whoa,straight to the heart.Joni Mitchell is an amazing artist.I hope she continues to make music for many many more years to come.
B00000JGEH|4.0|Just about everything that can be said about THE TERMINATOR has been said already. That in itself is a testament to the quality of the film and how monumental it has become. When this movie was made, Arnold Schwarzeneggar was just an up and coming action/adventure star who was still best known for his body building days; James Cameron was a little known director that the studios didn't trust enough to give him the type of budget he needed; and the phrase \\"I'll be back\\" was what people said when they left the house to go get groceries. THE TERMINATOR changed all that vaulting the careers of Arnold and Cameron and making \\"I'll be back\\" a part of the American vernacular. The film had a rather limited budget, but surprisingly the movie holds up rather well even after nearly two decades after it's making; some of the \\"cheap sfx shots\\" (e.g. The Terminator fixing his flesh and eyes) look better than some modern million dollar special effects shots. The story is strong and holds the movie together. Also, though this is an action movie, the acting is rather well done. About the only negative part of the film is the cheesy techno soundtrack and score; the music is about the only thing that dates the film. A great science fiction/action film and a film that anyone who is interested in American popular culture should watch.
B00005YW4H|5.0|I found \\"Come Away With Me\\" on Amazon last year, and ever since i first listened through the album in its entireity, i hoped that something big would become of this artists. Norah's soothing, mellow vocals pulsate through your speakers with the effect of Sting, never letting you turn it off. Great songs, great romantic songs...great date music. Buy this album if you want a good cd you will listen to for a while.
B00008PW3Q|5.0|Don't let people convince you these guys are too old to put out anything worthwhile anymore.  So what if they are over 50, this album stands on its own.  I don't consider myself a huge Mac fan (I was too young when &quot;Rumours&quot; and &quot;Tusk&quot; came out), but I've been discovering a lot of their material as of late and picked this album up on a whim.  I'm glad I did.  I can always tell a good album if several of the songs stick in my head days after a first listen.  That's a good enough measurement of a good album for me.  At 18 songs, there's a lot of material here and it doesn't drag very often despite its length (considered at one point to be double album).  Lots of older material here from a Buckingham solo album never completed; if you review &quot;The Dance&quot; he even mentions it and &quot;Bleed to Love Her&quot; makes its way here.  The opener, &quot;What's the World Coming to&quot; has a familiar feel to it while &quot;Murrow Turning Over in His Grave&quot; does a complete 180 with Lyndsey really tearing it up with a lengthy solo at the end.  &quot;Illume&quot;, &quot;Red Rover&quot;, and &quot;Silver Girl&quot; are some of the darker tracks here while the single &quot;Say You Will&quot; and &quot;Miranda&quot; are catchy and uplifting as you would expect on any Mac album.  &quot;Running Through the Garden&quot; has an 80's pop feel to and it shows Nicks is still very much in form.  In fact, it is hard to pick any song here that is mediocre.  These guys have been criticized for their versatility, but I like the quick changes of pace they throw in there.  Lyndsey's production is great.  It's hard to say how different this album would have been with Christine, but even with some familiar sounds here this album has a different feel from past albums.  I thoroughly enjoyed this album.  The age thing is tiresome and don't let overanalyzing critics tell you this is not another &quot;Rumours&quot;.  It doesn't have to be.
B00008PW3Q|3.0|I love Fleetwood Mac.....period. That said this project can't quite be pawned off as the long awaited, much hyped first album in a zillion years by the original line up for one simple reason. That reason is that Christine McVie has left the nine lives of The Mac....period. This is really a Buckingham Nicks reunion and I guess that is good enough, except the music really isn't. Fleetwood Mac's golden years spanned from 1975-80 when they created three of the most magnificent albums in pop, their self titled &quot;Fleetwood Mac,&quot; the legendary &quot;Rumors&quot; and the most brilliant of all, &quot;Tusk.&quot; &quot;Mirage&quot; and &quot;Tango in the Night&quot; had their moments. The band could of done reunion tour after reunion tour into infinity a la The Eagles on their past catalogue alone. So hats off to them for putting out an album of original material a la Blondie (No Exit was a much better album though). &quot;Say You Will&quot; is proficient but the production is just a little to slick and works out any of the organic brilliance on the earlier recordings. Nicks post recovery work covers little new ground and her vocals lack passion....I guess there is indeed Trouble in Shangra La. Most distressing is the absence of Christine McVie whose overwhelming contribution to the success of the Rumors-era line up just can't be overlooked. Her cool and grounded perspective was so necessary to the whole and those famous harmonies just aren't there.  Get the cd for old time sake, mourn the loss of Ms. McVie and then go see the band for what will probably be their last tour. See you there.
0486650677|5.0|Surely Lanzcos is one of the few educators that compare to Feynman. This book presents an exceptionally lucid and engaging development of the main variational principles of mechanics with the discussion of Noethers theorem being the most cogent I've seen. While the problems may not be exceedingly difficult, this is because the problems are intended to illuminate the ideas under discussion.  <br />Lanzcos divides mechanics very roughly into two camps, the vectorial/one-form viewpoint versus variational/analytical view.  Since Lanzcos aspires to the variational view, the criticism concerning the lack of discussion of vectorial/one-form is rather moot and explains why there are not a great number of drawings.  While this may be a problem for some, in my view figures can convey a false sense of understanding.  <br />This is not a work that one can skim, it expects considerable reflection on the contents. We all differ in our needs and wants but in my view, this exposition exudes a truly infectious sense of wonder that such simple ideas could be so powerful and beautiful.  But since no one book in this field may suffice for all one might also consider \\"Mechanics: From Newton's Laws to Deterministic Chaos\\" by Florian Scheck which admittedly covers mathematical methods that Lanzcos does not yet fails to capture the essence of the ideas as well as the Lanzcos text does.
B000089RVX|3.0|I am proud to say that i was never one of the people who believed Evanescence was a spiritual group, and after their recent EW interview barring all such ties, I sat back and had a good laugh after the album was so desparately yanked from all christian music shelves. Enough of that though, Fallen represents in my eyes the female version of a &quot;linkin park&quot; type band. I know not has hard rock, but they do have the radio addictivity, and the same power-rock type approach. All of &quot;Fallens&quot; tracks are much of the same, and dont break the formula..but that isnt such a bad thing. Its not a bad listen, but after you've played it 100 times you arent going to play it again.
B00008PW3Q|5.0|This is a CD that starts out a little slowly, but at some point you realize that you are listening to something very special.  Many people will consider `Rumors' to be Fleetwood Mac's landmark effort.  Don't expect this CD to sound like `Rumors' because the band has evolved.  However make no mistake about it - this is classic Fleetwood Mac and the songs are fresh and full of energy.  The contents are very diversified with styles ranging from Lindsey's `Out of the Cradle' to Stevie's `Trouble in Shangri La' as well as radio ready songs, such as `Peacekeeper', `Silver Girl' and `Steal Your Heart Away'.  It's clear that the band's chemistry as demonstrated in `The Dance' is stronger than ever.  I've been listening to Fleetwood Mac since 1970, when I first heard `Kiln House' and `Future Games' and feel that this is the strongest effort by the band to date - including `Rumors'.  I can't wait to see them on tour.  This is a must buy for even casual Fleetwood Mac fans.
B000089CJI|4.0|Dntel's Jimmy Tamborello and Death Cab For Cutie's Ben Gibbard knew they were on to something good as soon as they finished collaborating on the track \\"(This is) the Dream of Evan and Chan.\\" That compelling combination of Tamborello's melodic knob-twiddling and Gibbard's literate vocals and forlorn delivery was the triumph of Dntel's acclaimed 2001 release Life Is Full of Possibilities. Not long after that first collaboration, The Postal Service was born. The relative strangers began recording in December 2001, swapping tracks on CD-Rs through the mail. <br />Listening to the act's debut brings back the same sort of giddiness inspired in me by New Order's Low Life when I first picked it up a decade-and-a-half ago. The Postal Service expertly channels that adolescent spirit with an awkward blend of dance beats and melodic songwriting. However, the duo has updated the sound for the millennial set, pleasantly mixing Depeche Mode beats and bass lines, Pet Shop Boys melodies and Warp Records-styled twinkling tones and clicks. Orchestral samples and pseudo horns add an unusual flavor to \\"Clark Gable.\\" Chunky, monophonic Casio-sounding keys tie the vocals to the beat in \\"Nothing Better.\\" <br />Two of the album's highlights appear right at the front end of the record. The first song, \\"The District Sleeps Alone Tonight,\\" leads with brooding organ, before beats saunter in and steadily cruise through the first verse and chorus to a clean, ringing guitar riff. A second chorus pumps even harder and defies you to not sing along. This despite a characteristically bumming realization repeated by Gibbard: \\"I am finally seeing why I was the one worth leaving\\" (Christ, Benny, just stick a fork through my heart, why don't you?). Track two, \\"Such Great Heights,\\" has already been released as a single. The catchy number apes Rod Stewart's \\"Young Turks,\\" especially the beat and understated arrangement, albeit in an electro fashion. <br />The remainder of Give Up is solid, though Gibbard'slyrics are less potent by the middle of the record, and Tamborello burrows perhaps a little too deeply into some of the thinner sounds of the cold '80s era that inspires him. \\"Sleeping In\\" stumbles a bit with Gibbard's trite invocation of the JFK assassination, but the murmured chorus, \\"Don't wake me, I plan on sleeping in,\\" that drapes over a quiet acoustic guitar phrase is strong enough to carry the entire song. <br />Perhaps the only shortcoming of Give Up is that the adherence to pop shuts out some of the more interesting electronic elements explored on Life Is Full of Possibilities. \\"Natural Anthem\\" is probably the most adventurous Postal Service tune, utilizing a relatively heavy break-beat, a looping string sample and more aggressive production, but clearly the duo's strengths are geared more toward hit-making than trailblazing. So, while the record isn't necessarily an instant classic, the unabashed embrace of simple pop sensibilities, both old and new, make it a record that is hard to stop listening to. <br />Jay Breitling <BR>Junkmedia.org Review
B00005OAIE|4.0|A year and a half later, Room for Squares is still making hits. Some people just dont understand how John Mayers album can have such an amazing shelf life...my response to them would be if you actually want your album to sell, make a cd filled with good songs, and that is what John has done. From start to finish you dont become bored, and the music is just has honest the first time he sings it to the very last second of the cd. It is sad that we dont have more artists out there that will sing this good.
B00005JLEU|5.0|this is an absolute masterpiece!  you should definitely buy it.<BR>the English dub isn't great though, recommend you to choose the Japanese dialogue with english subtitle when you watch it, it's much better this way.
B00008IXAR|5.0|simply red? oh,that's the band from the 80's! well,think again. after a few dissapointing albums, that were at best background music for major shopping malls , simply red produced an album that is worthy to have the bands name on the cover . i was hoping that this would happen , well , it did !!! a must buy for every simply red fan , and for people who still have that english band from the 80's , with the red headed frontman , on their mind . LOVE IT , MODERN SOUL AT IT\\"S BEST!!
B00008PW3Q|5.0|I was very suprised by the sheer quality and time that must have been put in Fleetwood's latest release, &quot;Say You Will&quot;. I dont give many 5 stars, but this album is quite deserving. With more than enough songs to please any fans appitite, belive me when i say that this album is really good.

078322608X|5.0|Gilliam's Hamster effect is truly an art of mistake and too much overachieving in the result of this visually messy masterpiece of time travel webbed into someones fateful moment. I am a big fan of alot of Gilliams work and first I must say the extra features including the 'Hamster Effect Documentary' is worth the buy but I have seen this movie many times and watching it on DVD was watching the whole thing over and over again! The story is twisted in Gilliam style and probably the only style he will ever agree to put effort into film but this is a cool and very stylish film. If your a fan of Terry Gilliam and you are looking for a film with more depth than the time in which it was spent actually writing the story than this movie is definitely worth the watch!
B00008PW3O|3.0|Lindsey Buckingham may be one of the greatest guitarists in rock music today but his songwriting abilities leave much to be desired.  Other than &quot;Peacekeeper&quot; and the opener &quot;What's The World Coming To&quot; his other contributions border on the bizarre.  Stevie Nicks has never sounded better, especially on the best track on the album &quot;Thrown Down&quot; but Christine McVie is certainly missed.  If one eliminates 6 or 7 songs from the album (76 minutes in length) you have a mighty fine effort.  As it is, the results are much too uneven to give it a hearty endorsement.
B00000JGHM|5.0|After all these years and 2 hours after the movie it happens.... Robert DeNiro and Al Pacino talk face to face in a diner. I know it sounds stupid but for the past twenty years writers have thought of every stupid excuse to put these two heavyweights in a movie together but it never happened. Finally Heat has the two starring in the same film but both actor's are on different sides making this a true classic Crime Story. It's almost like one of those classic detective films but for this era instead with a sleek style and shiny criminals joining dirty ones to make big heists. Val Kilmer is in it and he's alright ... Anyways, the fact that this is the only movie that stars DeNiro and Pacino since the Godfather 2 and the fact that this time they are both in the same time frame so when the two talk to eachother it's something you have to see for yourself. You can tell the scenes where done almost surgically when the two appear on the same screen. Anyways this movie is good and it's an essential to any Action movie collector!
B00008J2DQ|5.0|All the people downing this CD are all morons. It's simple.....you all think too much about music. I don't wanna listen to anything intellectual to enjoy it. The CD rocks and thats all there is to it.
6304806442|4.0|I just bought this DVD yesterday and I finished watching the whole thing again and I have to see I love this movie! It's not your average 'druggie with a plan' movie but instead it shows a group of heroin addicts living a really dirty life in a town that looks like it was painted all in a rust colour varnish. The acting is great as you can see the actors' portrayal of thier addictions as they sweat perfusely and go all crazy and on the edge just to get a hit. If you have the chance to watch the film I suggest you do because the narration done by Ewan McGregor in the film goes great with the trials and tribulations that him and his friends go through daily. In all if you want to see a movie that was 'groundbreaking' when it was released in theatres and now not even played once on any television show except those really type of sophisticated channels that show woman eating poo! Just kidding but this movie is not an elegant one and it gives you the muddy vision that the broken down town consumes of their lives. A true gen-X classic! I suggest also Shallow Grave starring Ewan McGregor which is another good film but I can't find any copies of it so I can't say anything about it!
B000002UDB|1.0|Flying, Blue Jay Way, Your Mother Should Know, Baby You're A Rich Man.  Did the group just not try to write a complete album or were they out of ideas?  The so-called better tracks, Penny Lane and Strawberry Fiels suffer from Paul's lightweight writing and John's nasally singing - &quot;Straw Berry Fieeeelds For Eveh..&quot;<BR>Ugh.<br />Who knows, but it sure doesn't stand up to anything before or after its release. Anyone who rates this 5-stars is simply swept up in the Beatles.  They can't be listening to the music.
B00008H2LE|5.0|Anyone who says the've ran out of ideas is wrong. This cd is different from hybrid theory but its still sounds like linkin park. Songs like &quot;breaking the habit&quot; and &quot;Faint&quot; are just two of the most amaziing songs on this album. Its got more slower songs on it than hybrid but its heavier ones are more heavier than the ones on hybrid anyways ya this cd is frickin amazing buy it thats all i have to say.
B00008PW3Q|3.0|This CD came as a major disappointment:  having set the bar so high, one expects a great effort from a classic band.  Too bad.  That expectation was not fulfilled on 'Say You Will.'  Christine McVie, alas, isn't available to add her candy-coated playful tunes to dilute the underlying darkness of Buckingham/Nicks.<br />Another problem is time. Not the decades that have passed since Mac's heyday, but the very long 76 minutes it takes to wade through &quot;Say You Will.&quot; It's at least one-third longer than it needs to be. Cut six or so songs and you'd have a much better album. Because most CD players come equipped to program, you'll just have to do it yourself.
B000089RVX|5.0|I first heard this band when i was watching a trailer for daredevil and it featered there song &quot;Bring Me to Life&quot;. Then i saw the movie and heard the other song but them called &quot;My Immortal&quot; thats when i got hooked so i checked out the cd and seriously every song is good not one dissapoints. I highly recomend this soundtrack to anyone who is a fan of linkin park. This is like a girl version of Linkin Park and from how good this band is i wouldn't be surprised if it became as popular as linkin park.

B0000640VN|5.0|I saw this movie with my family and i expected a good movie and it was really good. This is one of my favorite movies in the category of romantic comedies. I think that girls and guys will like this one for a date movie. It will make you think a lot about the life that you live. It is also very well made. Meg Ryan and Hugh Jackman do really good acting jobs as well. The story is very interesting with a kind of science fiction twist to it as well.
B00008PW3Q|3.0|After following FM for 20 years this has to be the weirdest yet (and I thought &quot;Tusk&quot; was strange).. Some of the tracks have great potential for popularity, such as tracks 4,7,12,13,16 &amp; 18, but some of the other tunes are really wacky for Fleetwood Mac. I only wish Stevie's songs on her last solo cd were as good as the ones on this one.<br />A must have for fans and collectors, but this album makes you wonder just where this band is trying to go... and maybe, just maybe, it's time for the band to go seperate ways once and for all.
B00005PJ8O|4.0|First, it's long.<BR>But I didn't realize that until the \\"intermission\\" came across the screen.<br />Second, it has so many great lines that Patton used in his life, that you could be a veritable source of military aphorisms just by watching this movie (did I just write \\"plethora?\\").<br />I watched this immediately after finishing the even longer Band of Brothers series.  It was interesting to see two views from the same side, especially of the Battle of the Bulge.  It also goes to show how much technology has come.  Many of the scenes in Patton are pretty cheesy.  The battle scenes are distant as to show the entire battle, but have no focus.  The Battle of Kasserine Pass in the movie is one such example where it looks like little toy electric tanks moving and every few seconds a soldier self-combusts.  Additionally, the snow scenes in Patton during the Battle of the Bulge are extremely bad and a bit too fake.<BR>  But dang, its all about the acting, isn't it?   That is exactly what makes this movie.  That is why I give it a better rating, and am not even basing it off of visual effects, though they can be a bit distracting at times.
B00008GKEG|5.0|Well folks, the wait is over!  You can stop looking for the ultimate Beatles Documentary.  I remember when this special was shown on TV a few years back, and enjoying it sooo much. I didn't miss  one episode. When I found out I could order it in VHS, I was on the verge of doing so when I thought: &quot;Well, it's going to be  one heavy item in my collection&quot;, so I started putting up votes in order to get it released on DVD. Thanks to whoever did it, I must say!  This is by far THE BEST summary of all things Beatles. I particularly enjoyed the Special features DVD with the reunion of the last remaining members of the most famous band in the universe!.  Just being able to hear the intro to &quot;Raunchy&quot; played by George and Paul and Ringo hitting away in the drums was pure heaven.  Anyway, I highly reccomend this item to everyone, and I am sure you will enjoy it!.<BR>Salute<BR>Rodolfo Mendoza
B000055Y0X|4.0|Remember this is about the SPECIAL ED. DVD-<BR>I've seen Dr. Strangelove quite a few times, and the special edition is ok, but just like all the other \\"special edition\\" dvds that are out there.  <br />There is one semi-cool easter egg in it: on the main screen, if you press down until the globe is highlighted, and press enter, a screen lowers and does a quick montage of everytime \\"Plan R\\" is mentioned.<BR>  <br />As for the movie itself?  Who can't love George C. Scott as General Buck Turgidson?  Quite a bit different from Patton.  That's the kind of General I want running things!  Get the secretary, then head off to the War Room!;)<BR>  <br />There are great characters in this movie.  There's not time spent wallowing in each characters mind, but you can actually get a small idea on what multiple people are all about, which is pretty rare in movies that are \\"fun\\" to watch.  Yes, it's black and white, but leave your annoying preconceptions at the door.<BR>

0385334176|4.0|Another failed Vonnegut character mopes through life, bemoaning his failures and viewing all with a jaundiced eye, as he waits for the end.  This is a note that Vonnegut strikes often: a poor ineffectual fool passively accepts his fate in an absurd, random universe.  The more Vonnegut I read, the more tired I become of this tune, but I must admit that the author makes some interesting points along the way.<br />This time the fool is Rudy Waltz, who gained the nickname of Deadeye Dick when he fired a gun into the air, inadvertantly killing a pregnant woman a block away.  The story is fascinating and real when dealing with this tragic mistake and its consequences.  I couldn't help but feel some disappointment as the more absurd qualities of the story (ie, neutron bombs and radioactive mantlepieces) asserted themselves.  Vonnegut writes well about real people dealing with real problems.  I wish he would have restrained himself from introducing so many surreal elements; they smack of gimmickry and self-conscious symbolism.

If you read Alchemist, you can understand why Coelho writes the way he does. to me, his writings are away of depicting the human nature, and challanging it with it's own dreams. that's how Veronica got trapped in between her dreams and her reality. <BR>The plot was strong, but how people were quickly effected by Veronica was too fast, they didn't have the chance to know her well to be in any way a change in their lives. that's the only downpart i see. <br />but you just can't resist a Coelho story!

0920668364|5.0|This book has touched me more than any.  My youngest son is 11 and I still own this book.  I cry every time I read it.  It is the sweetest book ever.  The bad reviews below are synical people without a heart.  How someone could find this mother/son love creepy is beyond me.<br />An extremely special book.  Read it to your children and then read it again for you.

0316666343|3.0|I finished the book last evening.  I didn't want to read the book because of the subject matter but our book group selected Lovely Bones for April.<br />I must agree with some of the reviews.  The first half of the book was well done.  I found the second part where she enters Ruth's body for the sexual experience she lacked in life a bit too much like the movie Ghost. It was not necessary and made it too much like a Hollywood plot.  I agree with the other reviews that she may have hurried the end of the book as authors so often do.

6303012140|3.0|The Earthquake of 2010 impoverishs Southern California.  By 2032 all cities from San Diego to Los Angeles are merged into one continuous urban metroplex.  Societal rules also change.  Physical touching is discouraged to prevent disease transmittal and permanent coupling, everybody is excessively well-adjusted, and constant nagging surveillance instantly corrects any politically-incorrect behaviour -- everybody is passive.  Social rebels live and starve in the sewer system.  Then supercriminal Simon Phoenix (satan rises again?) escapes from cryoprison.  The police release maverick policeman John Spartan (Sylvester Stallone) from cryoprison to recapture Simon Phoenix (Wesley Snipes).  John Spartan must fight Simon Phoenix according to the rules of 2032 -- not a fair fight.<br />&quot;Demolition Man&quot; is a remake of H. G. Wells' &quot;The Time Machine&quot;.  In both &quot;The Time Machine&quot; and &quot;Demolition Man&quot;, a maverick from the past journeys into the future to save humankind.  H. G. Wells' masters are cave-dwelling primitives and his attractive surface-dwelling slaves live in Eden, while &quot;Demolition Man's&quot; masters are psychological bullies, its attractive slaves live in an overly-controlled Southern California environment and its dirty rebels are hunted in the sewers.  The goal in both fictional societies is total control over human populations.<br />&quot;Demolition Man&quot; is filled with flamboyant action and gratuitous violence -- both Stallone and Snipes are in great physical form.  Sandra Bullock plays Lieut. (Aldous?) Huxley, Spartan's partner who has some good moves of her own.  &quot;Demolition Man&quot; is a fun action movie that should *not* be dismissed as fluff.  Too many people are willing to solve all our problems, leaving us to sleepwalk our lives away.
B000001Y79|4.0|THIS CD IS GREAT MY FAVORITE SONGS ARE &quot;HEY YOU&quot; AND &quot;DONT SPEAK&quot; IF YOU DONT HAVE THIS CD YOU SHOULD GET IT GWEN STEFANI IS JUST GREAT IN THIS CD THE GUYS FROM NO DOUBT ARE GREAT MUSICIANS
0385504209|5.0|I had a blast reading this book ~~ it was fun, fast-moving and chock full of interesting information about a conspiracy and theories about Christ and his followers ~~ that I couldn't stop turning the pages. Dan Brown knows how to write to captivate an audience ~~ and I have to say that you shouldn't walk to the nearest bookstore ~~ you should run and buy this copy! Don't wait for the paperback to come out ~~ this is such a fun book that it's worth every penny in buying this book!<br />Robert Langdon, a professor from Harvard, gets a middle-of-the-night rousing from the French Police while speaking in Paris. The curator of the world's most reknown museum has been found dead in the museum ~~ and Robert, who was to meet this man, is one of the top suspects in this man's murder. And thus begins this book. With the curator's granddaughter Sophia, Robert begins a run for his life while solving the mystery from the dead man's last message in finding the answer to where the Holy Grail is.<br />Some parts of this book is predictable ~~ it was for me as I had guessed some of the answers early on ~~ but it's because I love reading books on conspiracies and religious themes ~~ not because he gave away the hints. But the historical studies and theories that are written throughout the book are very fascinating and some of the ideas are new concepts for me. It piques my interest enough to read more on them. With Robert and Sophia on the run for their lives and in solving the last riddle ~~ it does become tense in several places.<br />I wouldn't hesitate in picking up this book ~~ it's a definite thriller and must-read of the year. It's an intelligent book ~~ meaning that the author explains how they decipher codes and languages from the past ~~ and in such a fun way, you find yourself trying it out. Now I am hooked on Dan Brown's writings ~~ I plan to read more of his books. I have asked my husband this, \\"How come I have never heard of this guy before?\\" No fear, I will be reading more of his books!<br />4-17-03ng more of his books!<br />4-17-03
B00008PW3Q|4.0|With 18 tracks and over 76 minutes, this album approaches the length of sprawling double-album Tusk of 20 years ago.  With Christine McVie not part of this effort by the Mac, it's predictable that the soft, sweet kind of pop songs for which she's famous are not present in Say You Will.  Overall, I think it doesn't detract in a big way from the album, but her voice and harmonies that I'm so used to hearing are missing.  Having said that, the album is a good balance of made-for-radio tunes (like the catchy first single &quot;Peacekeeper&quot; by Lindsey and the title track by Stevie), frenetic guitar-heavy songs from Lindsey (the best one is &quot;Come&quot;), and Rhiannon/Sara-like songs from Stevie (like &quot;Miranda&quot; and &quot;Silver Girl&quot;).   One disappointing element is that there was not much input from the rhythm section, Mick Fleetwood and John McVie.  In Rumours, for example, Fleetwood provided multiple memorable beats.  In this album, it sounds like a drum machine would have done just fine.  In general, the album is a good listen; but I'll have to listen to it many more times before I decide where it ranks in the Mac's catalogue.
B000002AZ8|4.0|What to do with an album that begins with the lines \\"Lives opened and trashed; look Ma watch me crash\\" (\\"Last Exit\\") and ends with a disembodied voice responding to the question whether it would kill itself with the sentence, \\"Yes, I believe I would.\\" (\\"Hey Foxymophandlemama\\"). A somewhat difficult album to deal with (not as difficult as Nirvana's In Utero, though). There are moments of harshness right aside moments of sheer beauty. It has been said that Eddie wrote the whole album pretty much on his own (the writing credits to the whole band are there to preserve the illusion of unity). If this be true, then, he seemed to be having a personality conflict. It's as though he wants to be a punk rocker (\\"Spin the Black Circle\\", \\"Whipping\\", \\"Last Exit\\"), but couldn't forget his pop roots (\\"Betterman\\", \\"Corduroy\\"). Some interesting religious imagery as well, but I may be reading too much into it.<BR>I'm partial to good pop songs and depressing ballads, so high points for me are \\"Corduroy\\", \\"Nothingman\\" (breathtaking), \\"Better Man\\" (yes, it's overplayed; yes, it's a great pop song), and \\"Immortality\\" (the last verse is amazing).  The punkier numbers (\\"Last Exit\\", \\"Spin the Black Circle\\", \\"Whipping\\" and \\"Satan's Bed\\") don't do too much for me.  They're energetic, I suppose, but I prefer the more thoughtful, slower songs.  Then, of course, there are the frequently vilified \\"throwaways\\" (\\"To Pry\\", \\"Aye Davanita\\", \\"Bugs\\", \\"Hey Foxymophandlemama\\" aka \\"Stupid Mop\\").  Of these, only \\"To Pry\\" serves any real purpose.  It works well as an introduction to \\"Corduroy\\".<BR>Much like life, this cd has moments of beauty, harshness, sadness, anger, and confusion.  Definitely a cd that one has to be in the mood for, but highly recommended, especially if you enjoy post-Vs. PJ.
B00005JLEU|5.0|This is a wonderful movie. It isn't as deep as princess mononoke but it is wonderful just the same. I saw it three times in the theater in under a week, that's how much this movie moved me. It's not just a movie it's an experience. As an extra little bonus for anime fans the dub is very good, something I could watch over and over. (At least I thought so) One word of caution is I could see serveral younger veiwer being scared by some of the scences, so those of you with young kids at home are advised to watch this movie before showing it you your kids.<BR>I have only two complaints about this DVD set. One being I have some issues with the literal translation subtitles, though my Japanese is limited, I feel they could be a little more accurate. (A Spanish language track also would have been a treat) <BR>My other is issue is the &quot;selected scene story board accsess&quot; is simply for 1 scene. I would love to see storyboards for the entire movie like what was included for laputa, kiki, and the Japanese release. You can watch the story board with english or Japanese dialoge but be warned there are no subtitles.<BR>Over all this is a great movie and a great DVD. I'd give the movie 5 stars and the DVD 4 stars for reasons explained above.
0316666343|5.0|Despite all of the negative reviews about the ending of this novel, I decided to prep myself for a disappointing let-down when I was finished, and give it a try. Maybe I'm the only one who feels this way, but I loved this book, beginning to end.<BR>I felt like I knew every character personally, from the poor victim, to her family, friends, and even the murderer himself. Rarely do you find such developed personality among all characters in a novel-- they all seemed so real.<BR>One of the criticisms of a previous reviewer stated that many things, such as the mother and father suddenly accepting each other at the end, was left unexplained. To the contrary, I think the author did an excellent job of describing their awkwardness, and the mother's indecision about staying home for good. Like I said, by the time I reached the end, I felt like I knew the characters so well that every little thought they posessed did not NEED to be explained. If you read carefully, you can explain it on your own.<BR>Finally, I found the author's choice of fate for the murderer to be very appropriate. I don't want to go into too much detail for those who haven't read it, but although it wasn't an \\"ideal\\" outcome for him (i.e. a torturous death or capture or SOMETHING), there is much irony in his fate if you follow carefully. I also do not belive that Susie, the ghost, used \\"special ghost powers\\"-- what happened to the killer simply happened while she observed-- nothing more.<BR>I felt so many emotions while reading this novel-- fear, anger, sadness, joy-- it is definitely one of the best books I have ever read. The language is beautiful, and the souls of the characters will make you want to know them. This is a beautiful novel that inspires you to make the most of your life and appreciate your friends and family. Although it has been described as \\"fantasy,\\" it is realistic, nonetheless, and it is something I will never forget.
B00006RU5B|5.0|I bought this album being a fan of both Soundgarden and RATM.  I admit that when I first put it into my Cd player I didn't quite know what to expect, I didn't think that Cornell's voice and the members of Rage's hip-hop fused playing would gel well.  How wrong was I?  This album is amazing.  Cornell's voice is amazing and his lyrics are some of the best he's written in years.  The rhythm section of Tim and Brad are also great adding a muscular base to Morello's Led Zeppelin esque riffery.  I could rant about this album all day but that would waste your time as, if you dont have this album you really should go out and buy it, now!!!
B000021Y77|5.0|While watching this move for perhaps the 8th or 9th time I realize that foriegn film makers just know how to do things right.  This movie keeps you going from beginning to end.  It amazes me the drivel of films that we get here in America.  Whenever I am out I make a point to get my friends to go see somethng out of the ordinary and nine times out of ten, the result is fantastic.  Usually resulting in the viewing of brilliant fare like Run Lola Run.  The story in this film is filled with more thought than ten \\"blockbusters\\" could provide you with.  If you like this film check out Monsoon Wedding, The Devils Backbone, Best In Show, The Professional and East West to name a few.
B000002H97|4.0|This is the album that marked Metallica's entry into the mainstream.  This is the album where Lars toned down his trademark off-kilter (brilliant) drumming style for a more groove-based, heavier one.  This is the album where Kirk played some killer solos (Unforgiven, The Struggle Within) but was underused. This was the album where Jason could be heard in the mix (He couldn't on AJFA due to poor production).  This was the album where Metallica dropped their anti-war theme for a more ambiguous one.  This is the album some fans regard as their best (It's not, MOP is).  It's a good album, it has some killer songs on it but if you want to hear Metalica the way they were (And now hopefully are with St Anger) Then listen to their first four albums, these define Metallica better then this album does.
B000003TAW|5.0|weezer debut album is such a perfect blend of all the right ingredients.  rivers cuomo and company mix rock with great sounding power pop.  i love the sound of the guitars: smooth with an edge(ric ocasek, from the cars, is a genius of a producer) this cd is so endearing in all the right ways.  american geek rock that captures catchy melodies and simple lyrics over music that rocks.  i love MY NAME IS JONAS.  so uplifting and upbeat.  what a great album opener.  <BR>     there are so many great songs here from BUDDY HOLLY(which rings in my head now at the mere mention of the name of the song) and SAY IT AINT SO(with its quasi-jazzy feel).  My personal favorite on this album is UNDONE-THE SWEATER SONG.  written about a relationship on the rocks but using the unraveling of a sweater to describe the downfall is genius.  <BR>     melodic and yet still grungy and highly listenable make this cd a winner from begginning to end.  now there may be some debate here.  i think there are weaker songs but not one of them are bad.  just some songs are stronger than others.   you really cant go wrong with weezer's blue album.
B00008MNYS|5.0|Robbie delivers again! &quot;Escapology&quot;, his fifth studio effort, is among his best...but they are all SO good! But if you like what you hear, buy both the U.S. version and the international version because they have different songs on them. The U.S. version omits the songs &quot;Song 3&quot;, &quot;Hot Fudge&quot; and &quot;Cursed&quot;...while adding the songs &quot;One Fine Day&quot; and &quot;Get a Little High&quot;. Also, as with all of his cd's, look for the bonus track about 12 minutes after the &quot;How Peculiar&quot; reprise...it's called &quot;I Tried Love&quot; and it's hilarious!! I whole-heartedly agree with the other reviewer...you won't use your &quot;skip&quot; button once!
0684800713|4.0|I was surprised when I read a fellow reviewer's missive when he referred to Hemingway's &quot;lean, adjective-free style&quot;. I was surprised because the images from this book seemed so unbelievably vivid...but that person is exactly right. His prose doesn't tell you anymore than you need to know, but somehow tells you everything. It's kinda weird, actually.<BR>You can read the exemplary summations for yourself, but I thought I could smell the dust during the bullfights while reading the last half. A plot summary of this tome may seem  slight, but I don't think that was the point. It's clearly the telling of the story, not the story itself, to which people respond.<BR>I love the fact that so many readers interpreted things from the book in so many different ways...yet all with equal enthusiasm and zeal. That phenomenon should tell you more than someone simply giving a &quot;great review.&quot; This is a relatively short book that can (and should) be read slowly, to savor every line. It will drop you perfectly in the midst of post WWI Spain. I look forward to the rest of the Hemingway canon, which I have yet to experience. This is a temporary situation.
006016848X|5.0|I wish that I had found this book years ago.  It was by far the most helpful relationship book I have ever read.  I have since purchased most of the other titles by this wonderful author.  He makes you see things from a different perspective.  I have applied many of the things I learned in Men Are From Mars... in my life and guess what?  They work!  <br />I give this book my highest recommendation!
B00008PW3Q|4.0|Like many, I was not expecting much from this album.  The group<BR>are about twenty years past their peak and it had been so long since Buckingham and Nicks were both in the FM lineup for a new studio album that I doubted they could ever recapture their earlier glory.  I thought it would sound like bland, middle-of-the-road VH1 pop/rock--but I must say, hearing this record was one of the biggest shocks I've had all year.  The key is Lindsey Buckingham, whose guitar playing and production skills are simply stunning.  First, his guitar playing: tracks like \\"Miranda\\", \\"Murrow Turning Over In His Grave\\" and \\"Running Through The Garden\\" are very much in the classic Mac style, and<BR>the solo in \\"Murrow\\" is twice as good as that for \\"I'm So Afraid\\" (really!).  The intensity, the creativity, the signature sound is all there.  Then the production, with its experimental touches, reminds one of \\"Tusk\\"; he takes risks here that I would never have expected.  Finally, his songwriting is mostly <BR>first-rate, with the same energy and tunefulness that made \\"Go Your Own Way\\" or \\"Not That Funny\\" FM staples.  \\"Murrow\\", \\"Red Rover\\" and \\"Steal Your Heart Away\\" are classic songs.<br />Buckingham also greatly enhances Nicks' contributions, making them more interesting and convincing me that she should never again work with anyone else.  The two simply belong together.<BR>Although her solo work in the past fifteen years has been very iffy, she tries hard here and both her lyrics and vocals do not embarrass.  Particularly strong tracks include \\"Illume\\" (which could have been another soppy 9/11 tribute, but instead turns<BR>out firey and intense), the perfect pop song \\"Silver Girl\\", <BR>an old 70s outtake \\"Smile At You\\" (given another superb Buckingham arrangement) and the strong rocker \\"Everybody Finds Out\\".  The last two songs, Buckingham's \\"Say Goodbye\\" and Nicks'<BR>\\"Goodbye Baby\\", will bring a tear to your eye; the nostagia invoked in these two heartbreaking ballads is simply magical.<BR>Interestingly, two of the weakest tracks, \\"Peacekeeper\\" and \\"Say You Will\\" (both of which are the kind of bland VH1 pop I expected the album to sound like) have been selected for single<BR>and radio play--but don't let these fool you into thinking that's what the rest will sound like.<br />2003 marks the thirtieth anniversary of the release of the first \\"Buckingham/Nicks\\" album.  Now, with \\"Say You Will\\", the two have come full circle and created a work which ranks among the strongest of their careers.  What a delightful surprise.
B00008PW3Q|4.0|The classic pairing of Buckingham and Nicks shines on this latest Fleetwood Mac album. Many of these songs have subtle reminders of Lindsey's Mac work in the 80s, with just the right amount of seasoning the years have brought to his skill. Nobody can produce Nicks like Buckingham. Fleetood and McVie have not lost their touch at all... keeping rhythm with Buckingham's sizzling guitar work is astounding and these two pull it off masterfully, as always. Buckingham recalls himself on Tusk; a few tracks on this album are very conceptual and creatively genius. This is one of those albums you listen to several times, then start to feel like there aren't enough songs on it, so you hit Play again. The only thing I don't care for about this album is the sequencing- it's a bit jagged; maybe that opinion will change with more rotations. Anyway...Thanks... it was definitely worth the wait for a new album from this dynamic grouping of musicians, despite Christine's absence!
B00006CXXU|5.0|This is the best cd's of the year, christina has mature herself from that teen pop image and finally becomes a woman, I Hope she has a long career ahead of her.
B000089RVX|4.0|Amy Lee's voice is phenomenal.  Some of the lyrics on this CD are a touch melodramatic, but overall they're intelligent.  The thing that galls me is that sometimes one of the guitar players drowns out Lee's voice, as if the song is all about him and his guitar parts.  It's not!  The band needs to learn to showcase Lee's voice and not compete with her.<br />I can't wait for their next album!
B0000027RL|2.0|But I'm still not a grunge fan though, this cd does have some good songs, but As far as I Concerned, I Stopped listening to grunge in 1993, when it got more depressing and ridiculous, Alice in chains is the only thing I Like not this.
B00007K02F|1.0|I was expecting great things from this film. The actors are terrific, and the novel has been my favorite since childhood. Wow - was I ever disappointed! This is a pathetic, mutilated version of one of the best novels of all time. If given the choice of staring at a wall or watching this film, I'd take the wall in a heartbeat. If you are even remotely a fan of Charlotte Bronte or her novel, do yourself a favor and rent the 1980's BBC version with Timothy Dalton, instead.
B000084T18|2.0|I Know that 50 cent is the new thing of rap, but this cd is too overhyped and overrated for my taste, 50's raps were weak and predicable and the only reason people listen to this album are the media themselves, I Understand 50 cent been shot 9 times, but come on this isn't that good either<BR>Sorry 50 better luck next time.<BR>I Give him 2 stars for trying.
0385504209|4.0|In DA VINCI CODE Dan Brown brings back Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon from ANGELS AND DEMONS. Like his earlier outing, DA VINCI is a page-turner that is hard to put down, full of plot twists at a breakneck speed as the search for the Holy Grail becomes a race to stay alive. DA VINCI is teaming with interesting trivia that makes it worth a second read.<br />Also recommend: IN HIS IMAGE (The Christ Clone Trilogy, Book 1) by James BeauSeigneur for an equally enticing read.
B000002UDB|2.0|The songs for Magical Mystery Tour (the British television special in 1967 as opposed to the singles collected on the CD) are some of the weakest songs the Fab Four ever released. Blue Jay Way is boring, boring, boring and Flying is a throw away piece of filler. The title track and \\"Your Mother Should Know\\" are terribly written and seem like they were just cranked out in 15 minutes. The only good song on the whole soundtrack is \\"Fool on the Hill\\" and that pales compared to other songs by Paul such as found on the Revolver CD. The collection of singles on this CD are good. But even songs such as \\"All You Need Is Love\\" and \\"Baby You're a Rich Man\\" have fared poorly over the years. While I'm a big, big Beatles fan, even I have to admit when the Beatles made some [low grade music].
0385507755|3.0|This is a decent,readable book about a privileged white boy hitting bottom then being picked up by his parents.  The writing is perfectly adequate and, thankfully, lacks some of the pretension of the other privileged white boys that Frey so famously wants to tear down. Ultimately, it's a bit whiney and, for my buck, Jerry Stahl's PERMANENT MIDNIGHT is a much better, and more honest read.
B0000062GE|5.0|From what I've seen and heard, there's only one person whose reviewed this CD as bad, and personally, I wonder if maybe they didn't give it a fair chance.<br />First of all, this is far from typical goth music. It's a very emotionally powerful album, full of ache, anger, need and passion, and the lyrics are gripping, and can really make the listener relate them to their own experiences. He has a passion and rawness to his voice that makes each song that much more intense. Overrated? I don't think so. Not even close.<br />I personally absolutely love this album, and I think that Stabbing Westward is a brilliant and talented band, with alot to say, and an amazing way of expressing those thoughts!<br />I say a must have!
B000002572|5.0|Very few '70s records are so well produced, with the exception of Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon.  As bubblegum as many of the tracks are, it is hard to escape the catchy melodies and wonderful guitar layers that cascade one after the other.  This is of course the genius of MIT grad Tom Schulz, father of such inventions as the guitar/bass rockman.  I've had this album since its release in the '70s, starting with vinyl, onto to cassette, and finally CD.  And everytime I put it on, I find it very difficult to not listen to the entire thing before moving on.  That is probably what makes this great.  The recording pulls in and doesn't let go until it's finished or you have to flip the disc, change sides of the tape.  I doubt I'll ever get tired of this one.....
B00000427L|5.0|quite possibly my favorite composer, and this is one of the finest examples of a performance of all of the rachmaninov concerti for pianos, including the difficult to find fourth. i dont need to say anymore, so if your looking for a complete set of the concerti get this one.
B00005JKZT|5.0|It is hard to watch other movies after watching first the fellowship of the ring and then the two towers.  The actors are first rate and the special effects are a work of art.  And the love story the future king and fairy princess is timeless and breathtaking.
B00006RIO7|5.0|Okay, in all honesty who knew that these actors could sing so well? They took my breath away espesially Catherine Zeta-Jones and her version of Velma Kelly. I'm going to take this opportunity and diss Parade magazine by saying that Zeta-Jones did gave a grand performance her voice is so amazing and her dancing is just perfect. I think she did just as good if not better than Bebe Newerth. As far as the rest of the cast, I was impressed with Richard Gere and his portrayal of Billy Flynn and Queen Latifah did an outstanding job and the prison matron. Renee Zellweger her performance was good and her dancing was decent but her voice dosn't appeal to me but hey not everyone is a good singer, evidentally she didn't think she was that good of a vocalist either concidering that she prefered not perform at the Acamdemy Awards. All around I was impressed I would recommend this to anyone who likes Chicago. I like it so it must be good. HAHA.
B000000OA6|5.0|Innuendo is the best ever Queen album!That's my opinion of course.All the songs are greater than great.&quot;Show must go on&quot; was kinda requiem for Freddie Mercury.And &quot;Innuendo&quot; a great anti-war hard-rock flamenco with great lyrics that should make the incompetent politicians feel like 30 cents.The song goes on &quot;Yes we'll Keep on Trying,Yes we'll Keep on Fighting&quot;,&quot;Till the End of Time&quot;!<BR>  It depicts &quot;how we try peace and diplomacy in vain and war follows as the results of these failures&quot; with innuendoes.Anyway Freddie sings &quot;Don't Take Offence at my Innuendo&quot;
B00008PW3Q|3.0|Some nice things on this album, but you have to wade through some of Buckingham's more self-indulgent moments like Murrow and Red Rover. Highlights include the title track, Peacekeeper, What's This World Coming To. At eighteen tracks this is too long...especially since they are missing 1/3 of their songwriting/singing talent. More Tusk than Rumours.
B00005V9HH|4.0|GOOD,NOT GREAT  though unpredictable to the very end.It has Gabriel Byrne in it and Kevin Spacey when he was not that famous yet.Plus,the musical score's brill!
0312305060|1.0|I am shocked that this book won a Pulitzer and that it was then thought to be worthy material for a movie starring some of the best in the business.  I found the book to be extremely boring, abundant in flowery prose and lacking substance.  Why are Clarissa and Richard life long friends?  Why is Laura so depressed with her \\"perfect life\\"?  Oh, that's right because she secretly longs for a lesbian affair, after her lingering kiss on the lips of an possibly dieing neighbor.  Nothing about Laura's life would indicate she should be suicidal.  Maybe that is the deeper meaning of the book.....your life doesn't have to be \\"bad\\" for you to want to end it.  Obviously a man wrote this because I don't know any woman who would leave a three year old they adore unless their life was beyond horrible. After reading this book you would think that all women have lesbian tendencies.  On top of that the book is written in a highly confusing style (it must be that I'm just not schooled enough to appreciate the way he creatively ties the three woman's lives together at the end).  The worst part of the book is that it is sad and depressing, but you have not been coaxed into caring about the characters.
B00008PW3Q|4.0|After a 16-year layoff, Lindsey Buckingham once again returns to guide Fleetwood Mac through a studio album.  What's different this time around is that Christine McVie has opted to sit this one out, leaving this 18 track, 76 minute CD an ongoing dialogue between Buckingham and Stevie Nicks.  It certainly has its moments, particularly Buckingham's 9 selections (which were pulled from his unreleased 2001 solo album \\"Gift of Screws\\").  Tracks like \\"Murrow Turning Over In His Grave,\\" \\"Come,\\" and the stunning \\"Red Rover\\" recall the crazed glory of \\"Tusk,\\" while the more pop-orientated tracks \\"What's The World Coming To,\\" \\"Steal Your Heart Away,\\" \\"Miranda,\\" and the first single \\"Peacekeeper\\" seal his place as a master pop craftsman.  Buckingham also takes the reins over Nicks' 9 contributions, proving he his the best arranger/producer for her work.  The title track is as catchy as anything Nicks has ever written, made even better by Buckingham's intricate guitar and keyboard flourishes.  \\"Thrown Down,\\" \\"Destiny Rules,\\" \\"Silver Girl,\\" the gentle closer \\"Goodbye Baby\\" (a response to Buckingham's lovely \\"Say Goodbye\\") and the latin-tinged stomper \\"Everybody Finds Out\\" are all strong.  The meandering \\"Illume (9-11),\\" however, falls far short.  What made past Mac albums so strong was the way the Buckingham-Nicks call-and-response songtrack was tempered by McVie's often lovely, optimistic, pop musings.  Without McVie's presence (she can be heard singing back-up on \\"Steal You Heart Away,\\" which pre-dates \\"The Dance\\" reunion project), the back and forth can become a bit tiresome.  It's not to say the songs on their own aren't great, but as a palatable whole, it becomes hard to swollow at times.  That said, if you're looking for a modern (yes modern) pop album of substance - this is as far as you'll have to look.
B00005JLEU|5.0|Like \\"Princess Mononoke\\", director Hayao Miyazaki's latest animated film, \\"Spirited Away\\", was inspired greatly by animistic Shinto beliefs.  The story begins with a young girl named Chihiro riding in a car with her parents.  While driving to their new home, they take a turn onto a dirt road that leads them to an old building.  In spite of Chihiro's objections, she follows her parents into the building's entrance.  They emerge on the other side into daylight and walk towards a set of buildings.  The buildings appear abandoned, but when Chihiro's parents smell food cooking, they follow it to a well-stocked restaurant and begin to gorge themselves.  Chihiro refuses to eat and wanders away to investigate on her own.  When she returns, she finds that her parents have turned into two fat pigs.  When night suddenly falls, Chihiro is further terrified by the unexpected appearance of an assortment of strange spiritual beings; but one boy, Haku, helps Chihiro and tells her that there may be a way to restore her parents.  Will Chihiro, who is later renamed Sen, be able to restore her parents and survive in the strange world or spirits and magic?<br />As in \\"Princess Mononoke\\", the animation in \\"Spirited Away\\" is intricate, amazing and beautiful. Other very interesting characters include the witch Yubaba, Sen's coworker Lin, boiler manager Kamaji, the little black creatures that assist Kamaji, and No-Face.  Western viewers may find the story strange since the story contains no battles between good & evil, and also since many of the characters are inherently neither good nor evil for the most part either.  Overall, I found the plot to be very engaging, as well as the cinematography and animation, and I rate the film with 5 out of 5 stars.  The DVD version can be watched in its original Japanese with English subtitles, or dubbed in English, which was done well.  \\"Spirited Away\\" is a film that children and adults alike can both enjoy and watch repeatedly without becoming tiresome.
B00005RHGL|5.0|Do not hesitate.  How can all of us be wrong?  I promise you will love this movie.  It has everything a good movie requires to survive over time.  I have watched this movie numerous times and enjoy it more and more each time.  One of my favorites by far.
B00008PW3Q|5.0|They've successfully blended the expected FleetwoodMac sound with a bunch of new tricks.  I am really pleased with their progression and am glad they continue to change.  Lindsey and Stevie's new songs are great.  I can't wait to see them live this summer.  This album will bring the band many new fans and delight their old ones.
0385486804|4.0|Through Chris McCandless, the protagonist of \\"Into the Wild,\\" by Jon Krakauer, I came to realize that not everyone enjoys living in the depth of society. Instead, Chris resided to the wilderness, leaving after his college graduation to explore the west himself, changing his identity almost completely.<BR>The style with which Krakauer wrote this novel turns it into more of a mystery, making the book hard to put down. The summary on the cover of the novel gives away what happens, however, the reader is not told how or why. This alone makes the reader ask him/herself what possibly could have happened to the young hitchhiker. The novel also drags for one or two chapters when Krakauer relates his personal experience to McCandless'. I do not find the two to be very similar, and seemed to unnecessarily interrupt the actual story.<BR> The most intriguing part of the novel is how Krakauer makes it seem as though he was with McCandless throughout the entire adventure. There are many situations in the book that makes the reader wonder whether or not Krakauer made stuff up. For example, after Chris shot a moose, Krakauer explains that he, \\"butchered the carcass under a thick cloud of flies and mosquitoes...then laboriously excavated a burrow in the face of the rocky stream bank directly below the bus, in which he tried to cure, by smoking, the immense slabs of purple flesh.\\" (166). This is confusing because the reader knows that Krakauer was not at the scene.<BR> The passages placed at the beginning of each chapter are a technique that allows the reader to relate to McCandless himself, and how he viewed life. At the beginning of the 11th chapter, Krakauer places a quote selected from Walden, or Life in the Woods by Henry David Thoreau that says, \\"Rather than love, than money, give me truth. I sat at a table where were rich food and wine in abundance, an obsequious attendance, but sincerity and truth were not; and I went away hungry from the inhospitable board. The hospitality was as cold as the ices.\\" (117). On this page, McCandless had written the word, \\"TRUTH,\\" which shows that his actions were affected by his childhood.<BR> Overall, the adventures of McCandless himself are an interesting topic even without Krakauer's narrative.
0316096199|5.0|This is a wonderful book.  I'm usually not a reader of memoirs and thus my addiction to fiction brought me first to &quot;The Lovely Bones.&quot;  Sebold's novel, original and beautifully crafted, was one of the best books I'd read in years and her memoir, in terms of writing, is easily its equal.  &quot;Lucky,&quot; with its unswerving frankness and heartbreaking honesty, surprasses it in many ways.  Her themes here are similar -- how violence impacts not just the victim but family, friends and society at large -- but its deeply personal voice lends it even more power and resonance.  I high recommend this.

0783229321|5.0|This movie is a timeless hit that can be viewed over and over again. The movie takes place in a college campus. Their is a &quot;battle&quot; between too fraternities. One that is fairly poor and unorganized, and another, which is very serious. The movies actors are hilarious. The comedy may be somewhat twisted but it is still hilarious. If you haven't seen this movie buy IT!!
0345363132|5.0|Have you ever begrudgingly recieved a book from an excited friend only to become an excited zealot yourself after reading the first few chapters? <BR>This is one of those books.<BR>The best way to describe this book is daring. Before reading this, I brushed up on The War of the Roses. I'm glad I did and I suggest anyone before reading the book to do the same. By the end of the first chapter there is no doubt the author knows her stuff and takes you along for an amazing ride. Penman has the uncanny knack for psychologically dissecting each character and bringing them to life in thier own unique way. Working with historical fact, her conclusions come so effortlessly it borders on common sense. Most people will say that this is a book about Richard III. As far as the morally righteous protaganist, I agree. However, in this reviewers humble opinion it is more about a generation of a certain family with Richard III as a part of it. Family and relationships are major themes in this book. His brothers are as equally interesting and contribute just as much to the story. No character is short-changed. Especially Edward IV, whose standard is &quot;The Sunne in Splendour.&quot; Those looking for strong, atypical women can't do much better here either.<br />Sharon Kay Penman has given life to the War of the Roses with a passion few authors can rival. This one ranks in my &quot;Top 10 of all time&quot;. As I'm sure it will be with you and the friend-turned-latest-zealot that I gave my well worn copy to this morning.
B00005JL9B|5.0|I first saw this on VHS(copy of a copy of a copy). This is one of my favorite films. I got the DVD(NTSC region 0) the other day .... The sound is amazing. The picture is clear. The VHS copy I had, you could barely see the kids run along the beach and sound was awful. This version will shake your walls everytime the machine gun goes off. This is the first movie that made the neighbors complain about the noise. ... The directors cut version is also already available for NTSC region 0. I hope someday that they release the original in the US and we don't have sit through an awful remake by Dreamworks.
B00008URYM|5.0|The first single from Madonna's upcoming American Life album may be causing controversy due to the state of the world right now, however, the song is yet another example of how Madonna continues to evolve and grow as an artist. It is no wonder she has continued to remain one of the most influential and popular musicians over the past 20 years.  American Life may take a few listens to digest, not as commercially friendly as \\"Music\\" or \\"Frozen\\", but once it takes hold of you it sucks you in.  It is equal parts electronic and acoustic.  Madonna again works with Mirwais who co-wrote and produced most of 2000's Music album.  This time the lead single is more influenced by 80's synth sounds.  The song has a thumping electric bass line that sounds like a heavier version of early 80's dance and also sounds influenced by the new style in dance music called \\"electro-clash.\\"  Madonna's lyrics are very honest and autobiographical as she speaks from her own experiences how money and fame are not enough to make her happy.  Her voice, although at times altered, sounds very strong on this track especially during the chorus when she is singing backed by only the acoustic guitar.  In my opinion, this song is vocally and lyrically better than her 2000 hit single \\"Music\\".  As a bonus there is an extended remix of her 2002 hit single \\"Die Another Day\\" by Victor Calderone and Mac Quayle that is better than the mixes that originally appeared on the maxi-single.  If you are a Madonna fan or a fan of dance/electronic music, this single is a good choice.
B0000636UN|5.0|This latest offering from Sheryl Crow is a timely<BR>reminder of what real musicianship is (or used to<BR>be!) about--interesting lyrics, great hooks, sublime<BR>singing and playing, and a feeling that the artist<BR>is actually trying to communicate something personal<BR>to the listener.  How often do you find that in pop<BR>music these days?  You may quibble that there's no<BR>great change in style or sound from her previous<BR>efforts, and I would've put on a few more uptempo<BR>rockers, but you can't argue with this woman's<BR>talent.

B00005JLD4|5.0|This movie provides the experience that most of us hope for in theaters these days, yet hardly ever find.  The moving story of three aboriginal girls will take you to the depths of human sorrow and the heights of individual power and emotion to overcome challenges.  <BR>The music of Peter Gabriel will take you on a journey often deplete of dialogue and into a world where sound and scenery can tell a story itself.  Seeing this movie will hardly change your life, but for two hours you will experience a story that will forever change the way you view the world and human emotion.
0385504209|5.0|One of the most interesting  mystery books I have read in a long time.<br />I really enjoyed  the historical references and facts about codes and secret societies woven through out the entire tale. I will definately look for this author again.
B000002HRE|3.0|I have two ways of looking at this album:<br />One on hand, this is VERY beneath Metallica; the fast and furious hijinks that got me listening to them(a black guy that loves hip hop) 10 years ago are long gone. Thanks to them, I no longer associated heavy metal with [bad] pop bands like Poison and Bon Jovi and got into Anthrax, Cannibal Corpse, Megadeth and other super heavy bands. This Metallica died with Cliff Burton 17 years ago, even though I liked And Justice For All; which leads me to part two of this conversation:<br />This is not a BAD album! There are some bright spots on this album, including Fuel, The Memory Remains,Devils Dance and The Unforgiven II,but for the most part this not worth investing your hard earned paper in. Hopefully their next project will have let them see the light and come on home!
B00005JLEX|5.0|For a guaranteed release from blues and stress, the fantastic four always deliver. Life is never so serious that you cannot find time to enjoy it. :-)
B00007G207|5.0|First of all, there are two versions of the film on DVD, and everyone has their own opinion on which one they like.<br />I had only seen the 2 hour version once, so while I loved the movie, I had no real sentimental attachment to that version. In my own personal opinion, once you see the \\"new\\" version, you can't go back. It answers the questions left open in the edited version - it's like seeing the original and the perfect sequel all in one.<br />Anyhow, as one who normally enjoys action films and comedies, this film is a real change of pace for me. But anyone who doesn't love it is completely out of their minds. It sucks you in and makes you an emotional part of it. The story, coupled with an incredible score, takes you away.<br />It will also take your date away if you choose a special someone to watch it with. The ending montage is fantastic.<br />I have a DVD collection of about 100 movies, and this one, by far, gets the most playtime. Get it. Best money ever spent on a movie.
B000002UDB|3.0|I'm only going to refer to the 6 songs that make up what was the Magical Mystery Tour E.P. that supported the film. And I'll do something a little different with my review, in so much as I'll comment on the songs individually, rather than present a whole `dialogue' about politic / art / pop etc.<br />Magical Mystery Tour<br />A McCartney creation through and through. This song sets up the movie, or its premise by explaining the purpose of the Mystery Tour. Lyrically, not much of a challenge for the imagination, but musically its strongest component is Ringo's drumming throughout. It is also characterised by its multiple-harmonies singing `Roll Up'. By far the catchiest song on the album, it is more McCartney `Band on the Run' style storytelling, with little purpose other than to inform about something, but nothing in particular.<br />The Fool On The Hill<br />Interesting song lyrically from McCartney, again proving to be the main imputus for The Beatles catalogue of songs. Musically, the use of double-tracked recorders giving the whole song a Pied Piper kind of feel to the storyline. Its obvious that McCartney is making comment about someone or something in this song, but I feel its not explored well enough to give any identity or dissimilarity from the people who supposedly hate him. What it has to do with the actual movie is very hard to find. If The Fool was one of the main attractions along the way, or built up to be something of an oddity along the Mystery Tour then the song might be better explained. It is a good lyric, one of his strongest actually, but the people who hate the Fool, and why he's hated isn't explored deeply enough for my interests.<br />Flying<br />This `almost'-instrumental was written by all four Beatles. As a music piece to accompany a film, it works. I've always liked this song.Particularly the mellotrons and fade out at the end of tape loops.<br />Blue Jay Way<br />Harrison's one song on this album. Again, having very little to do with any kind of storyline, but then again the Mystery Tour plot is a bit weak. It is also one of my favourite Harrison compositions, whereas a lot of people see it as one of his weaker tracks. The reason I like this song so much is because not only does it tell you about a fog upon L.A., the music is also foggy. Voices come out from a dense wash of effects, strange and ethereal. The portrayal of fog in music is creating art. But as a said, I would try and stay away from commenting about Art & Pop. This song isn't pop though . . .<br />Your Mother Should Know<br />Another McCartney contribution that makes up the finale of the Mystery Tour film, incorporating the Hollywood 1930's musical extravaganzas into the tour's sights. The song is another one of McCartney's look back to the previous generation's music. It probably has its fans in many a grandmother or dear old auntie. I personally have no thoughts about this song other than I like the background vocals and Ringo's drumwork. It's just another one of McCartney's `I Am the Showman, I Am the Entertainer' songs which could have just as easily been done by Tom Jones or Cliff Richard.<br />I Am The Walrus<br />Hmmm. Where to begin? Lennon's contribution to the Magical Mystery Tour contains mixed blessings. Musically a fantastic piece of surrealism and the last vestiges of psychedelia in the Beatles work. Lyrically. I am not even going to attempt to say this is meaningful or not. That `pornographic priestess' is actually a line in a Beatles song is an accomplishment in itself.<br />The basic premise of this song was this, as explained by Lennon in 1980 - It's from \\"The Walrus and the Carpenter.\\" \\"Alice in Wonderland.\\" To me, it was a beautiful poem. It never dawned on me that Lewis Carroll was commenting on the capitalist and social system. I never went into that bit about what he really meant, like people are doing with the Beatles' work. Later, I went back and looked at it and realized that the walrus was the bad guy in thestory and the carpenter was the good guy. I thought, Oh, s**tt, I picked the wrong guy. I should have said, \\"I am the carpenter.\\" But that wouldn't have been the same, would it? [Singing] \\"I am the carpenter....\\"<br />So basically you have a man who doesn't know what he's talking about either. If anyone here has ever read `Through The Looking Glass' by Lewis Carroll, and the story that Tweedle-Dee and Tweedle-Dum tell Alice about the Walrus & The Carpenter, the allusions to politics are pretty apparent in the way the two characters betray the clams they are about  to eat. I'm not saying I'm so smart I figured it out when Lennon couldn't, but I am saying that when held up as an intellectual by the masses, Lennon again falls short by not even understanding the metaphors that Carroll deftly illustrated in the characters. Its why the works of Kafka, Orwell, Burroughs and Joyce are there. Taking the reality and submersing it in surreal or strange parallel worlds which echo the traits of our reality. It is not hard to see who is the cockroach in Kafka's `Metamorphosis'. That fans of The Beatles thought there were great underlying themes in I Am The Walrus, when the person who wrote it didn't realise what the actual Walrus was, shows the folly of believing Lennon's (or McCartney's) work has that much depth to it.<br />The best line of the song is the first line. The English garden section is also very well written, but the rest of the lyric is fanciful word play, allusions to previous Beatles songs by Lennon, and Lewis Carrollisms. A kind of `Ulysses' by a person who didn't quite understand that word-play CAN mean something despite its confusing or erratic prose. I can't necessarily fault the song for its lyric, but I can't praise it either. Its slightly overrated I feel, and I think Syd Barrett did this better or with greater gift.P>Overall and interesting album, faulted by its lack of cohesion, as well as the film itself.d the carpenter was the good guy.

B00005OAIE|5.0|In an era of \\"dirrty\\" girls and here-today, gone tomorrow rockers, John Mayer posesses something that most don't: true talent.  His lyrics are impressive and his guitar solos are great, quite possibly making Room For Squares the best album to be released in a good long while.<br />Radio-friendly hits like \\"No Such Thing\\" and \\"Your Body Is A Wonderland\\" are fantastic, but only scratch the surface of his superb range.  <BR>  <BR>The smooth vocals on \\"Why Georgia\\" are a welcome switch from the whiney-sounding voices of pop stars like Justin Timberlake, while the interesting lyrics of \\"83\\" obviously contain meaning, unlike the typical \\"wish you were my girlfriend\\" or \\"you're beautiful in every way\\" garbage that most musicians crank out today.  Other quality examples of Mayer's ability are \\"City Love\\" and \\"Not Myself\\".<br />For comparison, think off a more mellow Dave Matthews.  His voice is similar to Dave's, but the music contains fewer hard drum beats (and no harmonica!).  Hopefully Mayer's sophomore set will include a bit more of this sort of thing.  However, for a debut album, Room For Squares is right on target.
B00006GFAB|3.0|This album got three stars mainly because there is already two, maybe more, hits compilations (including Double Platinum) out there (not too mention a box set) so why do they bother to put out another one?  Its the same reason that Aerosmith and The Blue Oyster Cult have 4+ hits comp.  Because its [inexpensive] and easy sell.  Most veteran bands do this.<BR>That and KISS decides to shove the Disco song \\"I was Made For Lovin You\\" down your throat again, oh and how many times has Rock & Roll All Nite appeared on an album? Three or four times (again prolly more) I believe, and its the one KISS song youll hear on the radio all the time nowadays (for me its the only one I hear).<BR>I wonder how long Gene will make us wait for a newer album (with new music mind you?) like Psycho Circus, I dont know if hes got the balls to record one after he let Ace & Peter go.  But Im sure he'll continue to put out rehashes like this as long as morons in the KISS Army will buy them along with the KISS Casket.<br />If you dont already have Double Platinum get it before you buy this and then make a decision as to whether or not to buy this album for yourself if you are new to KISS (after looking at the difference in tracks), but if youre like me and have a good collection of the 80s albums dont bother with buying this, Double Platinum is a much better compilation although it is a bit more [costly] it has more (and better) songs all around.<br />...
B00007G1ZM|5.0|Poor Joan Crawford! Her memory may be forever associated with wire hangers.  And this is all too bad because before Mommie Dearest, Joan Crawford was remembered as a serious and talented actress.<BR>In Mildred Pierce, Joan plays a mother who gives up everything -- including her happiness -- for the love of her bratty daughter. Joan is so good in this movie, that I once read somewhere that someone commented on how you could actually believe Joan WAS Mildred, that you could actually believe it when she was mixing that cake batter.  <BR>Considered one of the best &quot;woman's picture&quot; in cinema history, Mildred Pierce is actually a brilliant film noir that works on many levels.  This DVD is packed with extras that Crawford fans and film buffs will enjoy.  Included on side B of the disc is a documentary on Crawford and trailers for six of her films! What a delight this is!  The only thing I do not like about this DVD is the cover -- it is misleading and does not really say what the movie is about.  For a film of this caliber, I am surprised that the studio could not invest on a nicer piece of artwork.  Overall, Excellent.  A+
B00000612G|5.0|I recently bought this CD and it has quickly become one of my favorites.  I would recommend it to anyone. You will never regret buying it.
B000001ELD|1.0|I have no idea what Gene was attempting to pull off with this album, so for all I know it wasn't an attempt, he was successful.  But I hope for his sake it was more like a failed experiment.  Kinda like a mix of chemicals sitting on a Bunsen Burner and exploding into a fireball of badness.  I hate to focus on negatives in my reviews, but I feel it's necessary to steer the unwitting clear of this one. I think that it's fairly obvious just by reading the (breif) liner notes what can be expected.  We see that an orchestra is credited, and then the appearances by Donna Summer, Helen Reddy (!?!?!!), and Cher.  Yeah, overproduction, overextension, and ultimately overblown.   I'm sure Gene had a big role in &quot;Music from the Elder,&quot; too.  There is an interesting parallel here.  Not that I could do any better, but really, we expected much more from you, Gene.
6301773551|5.0|Saying anything bad about this movie would be like having root canal without anisthetic. This is the one that started it all. Back in 1977, George Lucas transported movie goers into another world for a little over two-and-a-half hours, and you weren't the same when you walked out of that theater. Aside from the special effects looking a bit dated, and the fact that Harrison Ford takes a little while to get into character (his acting in the early scenes is reminiscent of William Shatner) the rest of the movie is as capable of taking you away as it was almost thirty years ago. Buy it if you can find it.

B00003CXPJ|5.0|Zoolander is one of my all time favorite movies. It is absolutely hilarious, and one of those movies that just keeps getting funnier every time you watch it. Every time I see it I notice new jokes. Ben Stiller, Will Ferrel, and Owen Wilson are great in it, too. The great thing about this DVD is the outtakes, which had me and my friends rolling on the ground. I have seen this movie a million times, and it never gets old. My mom, and even my 8 year old sister love it, and you will too!!
B00008977N|5.0|This is the best DTS concert that I have in my collection of around 100 concerts. The sound is phenomenal. Someone here also mentions &quot;questionable SACD&quot;. I can play both DVD-Audio and SACD and there is nothing questionable about either format. They are both much better than CD's (which I quit playing and buying about 6 months ago as stereo is dead) and Dolby and DTS.<br />The person that said there wasn't enough bass should turn their subwoofer on. This disc rattles everything in my room especially near the end of San Jacinto. Do yourself a favour and get rid of that theatre in a box and get some good equipment.
B00005OMTT|5.0|A a collection of Enigma's best tracks on one CD. I really love this music: deep, sensual, stirring, spiritual, uplifting. Each track blends into the next to provide seamless unity. Dreamy soundscapes, ranging from relaxing to powerfully upbeat, mixing numerous styles of music into what a genre that kind of defies categorisation. Favourite tracks - Gravity of Love, Turnaround, TNT For the Brain, Return to Innocence, Sadeness, Beyond the Invisible and Morphing Thru Time. Sublime!
B0000640VO|5.0|It is very pleasant and uplifting. I love it.
630407185X|1.0|This is one of the worst WWII movies I have ever seen. Last week it was shown on TCM; I'm glad I never bought it! It is the only movie I 've seen covering Operation Market Garden however, It was a sleeper. I couldn't wait for it to be over. I would not watch this movie again. Looking for action, Watch: Battle Ground, The Longest Day, Objective Burma.
B00008PW3Q|5.0|This album was such a pleasant surprise. I have been anxiously awaiting its release since the Dance album in 1997. I think this is definitely their best work since the Tusk album. I was particularly impressed by Lindsey's songs on Say You Will. What's the World Coming To, Murrow Turning Over In His Grave,Peacekeeper, and Come are examples of Lindsey at his finest in songwriting, singing, and definitely guitar-playing. I was also thrilled that Stevie finally recorded a few of her old demos like Smile at You, Running Through the Garden, and Goodbye Baby (The Tower). I think her best effort on this album is undoubtedly the title track, Say You Will. This album is also special because it is the first time since the Buckingham Nicks album (when are those two crazy kids going to put that album out on CD anyway?) that Stevie and Lindsey have worked together without Christine McVie's songs as a pop buffer between Lindsey's sexually charged, guitar heavy anthems and Stevie's mysterious, bewitching musical poetry.  I love this album and am extremely excited about seeing them in concert this summer.
B000084T18|4.0|If you look at 50 Cent's past as a an underground artist who has been out on the majority of bootlegged CD's in all of NY, you will come to understand why his success is not a surprise to many of us fans. 50 was known among the underground circuit as a \\"troublemaker\\" who was always one to voice his opinion and even clown other artist who in his opinion were fake or phony. It was because of this attitude that many listeners where \\"Patiently Waiting\\" for 50 Cent's album to drop.<br />A lot of haters will compare 50 Cent's voice to Mase and say that his voice is melancholy when in fact that is the one thing about him that differentiates him from the rest. Yes he's been shot and the bullet in his jaw makes his speech limited but knowing that you feel his voice even that much. True indeed the album is full of boasting about his accomplishments and street credits like track 2  'Gansta'. He says about his street team \\"We don't play that we, don't play that, we don't play that, G-unit we don't play around.\\"  This will not be the first time you hear the name G-unit. Which is the crew that 50 has been rolling with for a minute. The song 'Patiently Waiting' is overshadowed by Eminem's verse because in my opinion a lot of people who are Eminem's fans will just want to hear this song just to hear Eminem's voice as showcased by the video for this same song. The crowd went crazy when Em came out, get my point. The song '20 questions' featuring Nate Dog is an odd romance song asking a female how long she would endure his . I find this song to be one of the more light hearted ones because in one verse he says \\"I love you like a fat kid loves cake\\" and we all know how much that is.  <br />Favorites on this album for me were unlimited I basically have too many favorites to name. But there is one song that I don't particularly care for and that is 'P. I. M. P' which reminds me too much of Jay-Z's 'Big Pimpin' almost to the point of saying that it seemed like Deja vu when I heard it.<br/>Overall I would say that this album will become one of hip hop's classics. The two singles in the 'In the club' and 'Wanksta' do not really give you all the dimensions to the complex being that is 50 Cent and even though he's brutally honest with some of the ladies out there who want him \\"I'm in to having sex, I'm not in to making love.\\" There are so many things to love about 50 I love all 50 of  them or shall I say all 19 of them (tracks). In his song 'My style' a lot of us come to find out that we do like his style. Bullet shots, drug dealing, gun toating and all. I say cop this CD even if you don't really know 50 you will know what makes him a favorite to most.

0440237688|5.0|...Jonas's is a twelve-year-old boy living in a perfect futuristic world. There is no fighting, no pain, and no color, everything is completely organized.  Everyone is assigned a role in the community at age twelve. Jonas is assigned to receive training from the giver. The giver alone holds all of the memories of the real pain and happiness of life before the governors started the community.  But when training begins, things start to get tough.  By putting his hands on Jonas's back, the giver can transmit memories. The memories can make Jonas actually feel the pain or live the happiness.  Jonas finds out that his father has been lying to him about a baby boy, Gabe, and Jonas is forced to take action. Even in a perfect world like Jonas is in, life can be full of nasty surprises!!!<br /> I loved this book.  Lois Lowry did a great job of describing all the memories, it was like I was there instead of Jonas.  I also liked this book because it was a page-turner. You would be surprised how often I said to my Mom, \\"just one more chapter, pleease?\\"  At the end of the chapter she always left you hanging, which I personally think is a very good technique.  <BR>I'd recommend this book to more experienced readers who like science fiction books.  The only reason I was a bit disappointed with it was the very last part.  It was one of those endings that the author left you to decide the ending, and I don't really like those types of endings.  But all in all The Giver was a splendid, fun book.
B000002UDB|5.0|If it is even possible for a Beatles album to be somewhat underappreciated, Magical Mystery Tour is that album.  Maybe it's the cover image of the Fab Four dressed in wholly ridiculous garb; that image is rather offsetting.  As for the music, it's something of an odd mix of songs.  The first six tracks come from the rather obscure television film Magical Mystery Tour, and the remaining five are made up of singles added to the pot in order to cook up enough material for an American album release.  Thus, what you end up with is not a concept album such as the incredible Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band but rather a densely packed collection of huge hits complemented by several other very fine songs in their own right.  Of the seven tracks, seven are bonafide Beatles classics: Magical Mystery Tour, The Fool On the Hill, I Am the Walrus, Hello Goodbye, Strawberry Fields Forever, Penny Lane, and All You Need Is Love.  The last of these songs became a veritable theme song for the culture of love thriving at the time of this album's release in 1967.  I Am the Walrus is unquestionably the strangest song the Beatles ever released, but John's unique delivery of the seemingly nonsense lyrics is inherently fascinating.  I don't even need to expound upon the fascinating, psychedelic, and wholly unique Strawberry Fields Forever.  Besides being two of the Beatles' most amazing songs, I Am the Walrus and Strawberry Fields Forever also hold an important place in the mythology of the Beatles, supposedly containing clues pointing to the \\"death\\" of Paul.<br />The four less familiar tracks are rather remarkable in themselves.  Your Mother Should Know and Baby You're a Rich Man are fun and somewhat bouncy little tunes.  Flying is a short instrumental (short being the best kind of instrumental in my opinion) that is notable for its existence as such among the Beatles discography.  Then there is Blue Jay Way, George Harrison's sole contribution to the album.  It is a terrific song wholly in keeping with the strange, oriental-influenced type of psychedelic sound showcased in Sgt. Pepper's Within You, Without You.  It is a pity that George Harrison was never allowed to contribute more than one or two songs to any Beatles release because his songs prove the most fascinating and oddly compelling of all the group's recordings.<br />Clearly, this is an album all Beatles fans should cherish and listen to on a fairly regular basis.  Few Greatest Hits albums can boast as many chart toppers as Magical Mystery Tour can.lly in keeping with the strange, oriental-influenced type of psychedelic sound showcased in Sgt.

B00008PW3Q|5.0|This CD is worth every penny.  Stevie, Lindsey, Mick, and John all forge into new and familiar territory here.  There are soft songs as well as songs that really rock and are meant to be played LOUD.  There are a variety of song styles to appeal to almost anyone.  There will most certainly be a favorite song right away and a song or two that will have to grow on you as with any CD.<br />Songs to rock out to are Stevie's &quot;Everybody Finds Out&quot; and Lindsey's &quot;Come&quot;  &quot;Everybody Finds Out&quot; has the energy and power to it like &quot;Fall From Grace&quot; did on Stevie's Trouble in Shangri-La CD in 2001.  The best way to describe &quot;Come&quot; is a 2003 version of &quot;I'm So Afraid.&quot;  Excellent guitar work.<br />Other stand outs are:  Smile At You, Destiny Rules, and Illume.<BR>The lyrics in Illume are so powerful, they will give you the chills.<br />All 4 members are on top of their game on this one.
B00005JLXE|3.0|If I could give this film 3 1/2 stars, I would. First, Daredevil is one of my favorite Marvel characters. Its one of those rare comic vehicles that attracted the cream of the crop: from Frank Miller to Harlan Ellison. It is still a great read, but how is the film compared to the comic? Well, it is so-so. Ben Affleck did a decent job as Matt Murdoch, the costume looked good, but the character who played Electra did a poor job (I forget her name). <br />     Colin Farrell stole the show (as expected) as Bullseye; the fight scenes were OK but some of them were poorly filmed, the lighting was insufficient and you could'nt really tell what was going on. However the movie was pretty faithful to the original comic story. I say \\"original\\" because none of the Frank Miller storyline was used: Matt's mentor, Stick, or the Hand. That was disappointing but the storyline focusing on Daredevil's origin and his father was compelling.<br />  Will they make a sequel? Probably, the producers should make one, maybe next time they'll have Frank Miller help with the script.
B00008J4P5|5.0|Thank God, Thank God for the White Stripes, and their powerful ballads of pure soul. There is not one song i can say on this album that made me complain. Being a musician, I am gratified by the simplistic riffs, and imperfect perfection of Elephant. If your not into the White Stripes,(Why the hell not?), Give Elephant an honest listen, I guarantee if you know music at all this CD will strike an honest chord with you. If not go watch TRL.
0316666343|2.0|The idea of a girl who was raped and murdered quickly worked up a hype nationwide that allowed The Lovely Bones to even reach the hands of middle school students. I have to admit; the idea of which was so gripping that I bought the book judging from the \\"advanced praises\\" and the pre-release hype. Well, I should have known better. The leading chapter of the book about 14-years-old Susie Salmon was so well-written and promising that anybody who riffled through it at the bookstore would have paid and taken it home. What came after the opening was a different story. The book then meandered through a diverse string of characters who were if not emotionally dead, sad and pathetic. Susie's mother, who seemed to have withdrawn her emotion about her daughter, was so self-piteous and nonchalant. No less annoying was Lindsey, whose character seemed to have faded out after she shut down emotionally (actually I rather not to read about her after her embarking on a sexual relationship at such a young age). While the book did not follow a conventional plot, Sebald had to rely on the diverse characters whose stories Susie told from Heaven. (Is that really Heaven? I felt no sense of joy and happiness from that Heaven.) The attempt just did not pull through as much as the author intended. The result was a bunch of people doing weird things that were meant to enrich the novel but gave the impression as fillers. The epitome of such weirdness was Ray Singh, who was some sensual Indian from Britain. Well, Sebald tried too hard to include all the ethnic minorities in her little book. How about that Ruth who claimed to see dead people? Was she supposed to be like Cleo who possessed a divine psychic nature? And I have never encountered a grandmother who was as annoying as Susie's. Oh this is my favorite one: Holly. Holly was Susie's deceased friend who believed that there should be no other languages spoken in \\"Heaven\\" besides perfect English with the perfect accent. That's flat out annoying and racist. While there were so many open threads, Sebald rushed to an ending that was too contrived, too \\"neatly-done\\" and flat-out weak. So many things were left \\"as is\\". What happened to the villain Harvey? What happened to detective Len? Some of the characters change by 180 degrees with no reason. The investigation of Susie's murder never followed through and Sebald never bothered to tell us what really happened. The destinies of her diverse characters were left to readers' imaginations as they were abandoned at the end. The take-home message from The Lovely Bones is hype does not mean great literature. No wonder tons of used copies are making their way back to the bookstores (I'm usually a pack-rat but I got rid of this one). Readers shouldn't even take it seriously as a piece of fine literature but read it as a light-fare in one sitting. 2.0 stars.
B00005QIPH|5.0|How long has it been since you bought a CD where every song was good on it? This is the CD that lives up to that, and keeps it going. I bought this CD in December 2001, and it's stood it's ground in my 5 CD Changer for over a year now. This is a Great Album from a Great Band, which should have a Great Future.
B00005RYLE|4.0|Wow, your own copy of the necronomican (sp?).  This case rocks!! I have it sitting on a little easle in my office -- what a conversation piece.  It rocks.<br />With regard to the movie. If you are reading this then you know the whole Evil Dead saga.  If you ask me, while this movie is interesting, it is good to watch sam and bruce warm up for the second one.  Taken on its own, this movie is enjoyable, but when it is viewed as their honing of their skills it is incredible.  You can see what they wanted to do in this one, and then watch them execute it in the second.<br />The new sound and picture are a huge improvement over the first three releases.  It sounds and looks awesome.
B000066F6H|5.0|The Hives, where do I start, I loved this Album, while flipping through tracks like &quot;Hate to Say I Told You So,&quot; or &quot;Declaire Nucleare,&quot; i can honestly say, this album brings out the animal instincts music is supposed to bring out. Music is about expression, and this Album immediatly brought out the crazy.<br /> This album brings to mind, The Clash, and real american Punk, not the &quot;punk&quot; they play on the radio today.<BR> Oh, and the singer really wants to be Mick Jagger, which is cool.
B00005JMC6|4.0|Wale Rider is a beautiful - pure and innocent.  This is a New Zealand film and unlike previous well known kiwi films I.E Once Were Warriors - the acting is above par - OR Lord of the rings - it is pure and simple.  It is the tale of once girls search for her koro's (grandfathers) acceptance and his stubborn hold on his own beliefs.  If you ever have to watch a New Zealand film - you must watch this film.  <br />It reveals the true culture of the Maori people and their struggle to hold on to their belief system.  It shows that New Zealand is more than just grass skirt wearing sheep tending zombie flesh eating country.  As you watch this film remember it is only a small fraction of the diversity that is New Zealand.<br />For any man, woman or child who knows what family is or struggles to realise it.  <br />Not an action film granted but bring your tissues garanteed.
B0000041A9|5.0|I take issue with one of the reviewers below. This set of Beethoven Cello Sonatas is one of the greatest treasures of the classical catalogue.<br />This performance is absolutely magnetic from first to last. I have seldom come across a performance that is so compelling. I never thought of Beethoven's Cello Sonatas among his \\"stronger\\" works - like his Symphonies, Piano Concertos and Piano Sonatas. But these two great artists really makes the case for Beethoven's Cello Sonatas. Such compelling performances, such ravishing cello playing, such clear and wonderfully infectious piano playing. This cycle keeps you magnetized from first to last. <br />A strong point of this cycle is that Richter views the Cello as an EQUAL partner with the piano. So the piano here never dominates the performance unlike many other recordings. The Cello and the Piano are like two best friends having a wonderful conversation. Richter plays the piano fantastically - every note is in place and the tempi marvellously judged. There is an infectious spring in his playing - like lambs skipping about joyfully. Rostropovich on the other hand rises up to Richter's challenge and plays very sweetly, with spring when needed. Indeed, the music emanating from his Cello has a wonderful sweetness that I seldom hear. The legato is simply fabulous. Lynn Harrell on the Ashkenazy set is surely not up to this standard. The Ashkenazy/Harrell set by the way is also outstanding. But the performance is of a different \\"perspective\\" more hard-driven. Here, there is a wonderful singing line, and a poetic insight which is so captivating.<br />Charges of \\"static and humorless\\", \\"banal and savorless\\", \\"bringing out neither the majesty and fervor nor the lyricism and wit of Beethoven\\" ? This is no pure display of technical bravura but music making on the highest plane.
B00008PW3Q|3.0|But you know this is really a Buckingham/Nicks album with Mick<BR>on the drums. The absence of Christine is a big disappointment<BR>only because her ballads are some of their best work and is <BR>sorely missed here. This album is a good album and is<BR>worth the purchase. From one who has been a Mac fan since the <BR>Peter Green days ....the true REAL GENUINE FLEETWOOD MAC sound<BR>is still not here. I still long for the Kirwan, Green, or Welch<BR>addition. Unfortunately they don't sell so we'll take Buckingham<BR>and Nicks. Hey its better they did this album than not to have done it. You'll enjoy it. I rank this 3.5 ...Bare Trees and Future Games are my 5's.
B000089RVX|5.0|I wanted this CD so bad I sent to the US for it! Every track is brilliant. Stand out tracks are \\"My Immortal\\" which has to be the most beautiful song ever recorded. Tourniquet is  another great track. Hello is another great one. Hardly been out of the CD player since I got this.
B00005OWEG|2.0|In 1995, I attended a pre-release screening \\"In the Mouth of Madness\\", which was preceded by an audience Q&A with John Carpenter. He was asked for his comments on the then new trend of \\"Director's Cut\\" video releases.  His response was, \\"It's all about going to the video store, taking your wallet out of your pocket, and putting your money on the counter AGAIN\\".  While this is not always true, in the case of Apocalypse Now Redux, his words are particularly apt.  Had I never seen the original, I would have written this film off as self-indulgent, rambling, and unfocused.  The expanded scenes added insight into some of the supporting characters, but none of that did anything to move the story forward.  The Playboy bunny scene's comic tone was distracting, and the Plantation scene was so out of place, it felt like it had been taken from an unrelated screenplay.  I am a big fan of this film, but Redux is not a version that I would watch again - in my opinion, this film's greatest contribution is as a learning tool for film students as a demonstration of what can go wrong in the editing room. If you don't already own Apocalypse Now, go buy the original.  If you do, I recommed renting this from your local video store - it is a curiosity, but it doesn't stand out as a good film on its own.
B000002NIW|5.0|WOW!!!  I mean talk about some of the most beautifully heavy music ever pressed to compact disc.  These guys never disappoint. PERIOD.  Chino is one of best vocalists ever...even though at times I'm not sure what he's saying with the words he's using.  Doesn't matter because to me this guy's voice embodies LUST, I'm always longing for whatever it is that Chino is longing for when I listen to them.  The drumming is very tight on this album (as their drummer is alway bad [...]).  I love the big long resonating chunky chords that the guitarist uses.  Check out \\"lotion\\" and \\"mx\\", the latter having a guest appearance by the guitar player's wife.  Max Cavalera also lends guitar and vocal gifts to the song \\"headup\\" making it one of the most intense moments of the CD besides the climactic ending of the title track which is sometimes why I get up in the morning.
B000089RVX|5.0|If Fallen doesn't go down as an all time Goth Classic, Jacques Chirac will be the next President of the United States. (Ain't gonna happen.)<br />Amy Lee's voice is right up there with other Goth Goddesses, such as Tina Root of Switchblade Symphony and Katharine Blake of Miranda Sex Garden.<br />Whether she's soaring over a Static-X-style wall of guitars as on Going Under or delivering breathtaking vocals on an exquisite ballad such as My Immortal, Amy never ceases to hold your attention. And let's face it, she even looks like a Goth Goddess.<br />A stunning debut. Best Goth album I've heard since Serpentine Gallery.
B000096FUD|5.0|After nearly ten years of obsession and persistence, maverick filmmaker Terry Gilliam finally gets the opportunity to realize his dream of making a movie about that other impossible dreamer, Don Quixote.  This extraordinary documentary, produced by the team who gave us \\"The Hamster Factor and Other Tales of the Twelve Monkeys\\", covers six weeks of pre-production of this ambitious and already troubled work and the six days of actual production which destroyed it.<br />With an exclusive, almost uncomfortable closeness to Gilliam's project, we get a glimpse at other attempts to film the story (Orson Welles entertained the notion for nearly twenty years, achieving mere minutes of test footage); in-depth looks at storyboards with dialogue; screen tests of \\"giant\\" performers (as Terry quips \\"This is our trailer!\\" with his trademark Amadeus giggle); meticulous detail being applied to elaborate props and sets; auditions for character actors, and prep work with the film's would-be stars Jean Rochefort and Johnny Depp, and the overall excitement of launching a project of epic (though underfunded) vision .....<br />Then the cameras roll.  The crew are forced to film in an area adjacent to a military testing range, and the actors can barely hear their director or own spoken lines over the roaring jets.  Misunderstandings between members of the multi-national crew result in a lack of preparedness on a ridiculously tight shooting schedule.  A sudden storm literally washes valuable filming equipment down a muddy gully, and transforms the locale to one totally different from the one filming was begun in.  Star Rochefort suffers multiple herniated discs, causing excruciating pain while on horseback, and has to leave the production for an indefinite time.  A well-rehearsed horse becomes nervous in the presence of visiting financiers to the set, and can't perform.<br />Production is put on hold while Terry and company await word on their afflicted star, and the assistant director resigns.  It becomes apparent that the production must be aborted, the only option being to assess the damages with insurance operatives, and clearly define a clause known as Forces Majeurs.<br />Lost in La Mancha is an excruciating and candid look at a genius filmmaker confronted with a failed project, and the grace and stubborn optimism with which he faces it.  Like his hero Sam Lowry from \\"Brazil\\", the realization may indeed be one of hopelessness, but the dream never really dies.

0064407667|4.0|While I thoroughly enjoy all of the books by \\"Lemony Snicket\\" (do you honestly think that's his real name?) there is always the fact that he's overdoing it.  Honestly...if the orphans had luck that bad their fortune would already have been taken away and they would already have been killed.  Why are they still alive?  Because Lemony Snicket wants money.<br />But besides for that, the plots are satisfyingly intricated with quite a bit of strange surprises, even though there is always that slight lacking of maturity and the slight shadow of naivette that slightly destroys their would-be-almost-gothic darkness.  However, they are simply not dark enough.  There is always a bit of a sarcastic outlook without the type of humor that can be considered 'gothic'.  All in all, they are perceieved in the wrong way.  Lemony Snicket's books are not goth-like novels--more for people who enjoy being either saddened or who like to compare their own situations with the situations of others to show themselves that their life is not bad.  Not a bad idea.<br />I have almost the entire series, but I read the books many times each.  Unfortunately, as the author is trying harder and harder to finish his books quickly, he is beginning to lack the almsot realistic quality of his first book, The Bad Beginning.  The rest of the books did not have a tone even remotely as realistic, with the exception of The Unauthorized Autobiography The Wide Window, and The Reptile Room, but they simply didn't share the same air.  The books are all worth a read, but the quality is definitely slowly deteriorating as the series continues.<br />CasiquireZiphonium

B00005B36H|2.0|It's such a disappointment to witness a great band turn average.<br />\\"Lateralus\\" is the sound of Maynard Keenan and company settling comfortably into mediocrity. Their former drive, the urge to expand their sound, to try something new, is nowhere to be found on \\"Lateralus\\".<br />No one will mistake this album for any other band. Lateralus is Tool-rock. Nothing less, and nothing more. The first three albums (the \\"Opiate\\" EP, \\"Undertow\\", and \\"Aenima\\") established a Tool universe - \\"Lateralus\\" is content to remain within those boundaries. It's insular and formulaic.<br />Tool albums have always been visceral and challenging, but \\"Lateralus\\" is flat and predictable. To compare this to past albums is to compare the kiddie coaster at the state fair to the sprawling mega-coaster at your favorite theme park, the one that scared you half to death but kept you coming back for more.<br />Lyrically as well, \\"Lateralus\\" is unexciting. Granted, not every song can be \\"Aenema\\" (some of the best lyrics I've ever heard), but Maynard Keenan seems to have given up trying to connect on a primal level. These new songs are all about the mind and spirituality. That's all fine and good for some bands, but the thing is, Maynard was much better when he was emotionally intense. \\"Prison Sex\\", \\"Bottom\\" (both from \\"Undertow\\") - these songs spoke to my core being.<br />Here's an excerpt from a song on \\"Lateralus\\" - \\"Over thinking, over analyzing separates the body from the mind / Withering my intuition, missing opportunities...\\" I just can't feel passionate about music like that - it sounds old and tired.<br />This album isn't bad. For one, it's technically proficient, and there are glimpses of Tools past glory. But it isn't good either. It's a disappointment.<br />\\"Lateralus\\" marks the point where fans of Tool separate from those who merely admire the band's best moments. My tastes and interests are too broad to fall into the former category, so I will take my bow amongst the latter, asTool has obviously lost their creative spark. I urge you to buy \\"Opiate\\", \\"Undertow\\" and \\"Aenima\\" if you don't already have them, but leave \\"Lateralus\\" to the die-hards.
B000000W5B|2.0|Credit them this: Goat's Head Soup is a far different beast from its' predecessor, the acclaimed (and some would say greatest rock album of all time) Exile on Main Street.  None of the material here would have made much sense on that sprawling, decadent masterpiece.  In style and approach, the Stones certainly did not let creative rot set in.<br />However, be warned: if you're buying this because it's the album that comes right after Exile, and you want more of the same - RUN in the opposite direction.  Whatever weird, strange inspiration was in the air in France for thar recording, was undeniably missing during the Jamaican sessions for Goat's Head Soup.<br />Their silliest, most misdirected song kicks off the album.  Five years ago, Beggars Banquet led with \\"Sympahty for the Devil\\" - a first-person narrative through historical eras that is both lyrically insightful and musically inspired.  Here. the lazy, slovely Keef riff backs Mick singing about going down to the graveyard at midnight to go \\"Dancing With Mr. D\\" - even Ozzy never wrote anything so blatantly STOOPID - and that's saying a lot.<br />The songs remain in mid-tempo for most of the album - why?  Well, the third song is called \\"Coming Down Again\\", if that's any indication.  That's what this enitre album feels like - the buzz from the injection is displayed on Sticky Fingers and Exile, the eventual comedown and hangover is Goat's Head (and its' follow-up It's Only Rock and Roll).  Aside from the opener, none of the songs are terrible, but the performances are sloppy and lazy and lack that extra something to be worthy of the Stones at their most transcendent.<br />Another example is Winter.  A beautiful ballad, Mick's vocals are very, very good - but JUST miss being great.   Other songs of note are Silver Train (good but forced), Angie, and Heartbreaker (nearly great but the lyrics are a little too scatterred from verse to verse).  The one moment when the Stones should have let loose with an all-out rock performance - the album closer Star Star -  comes off as mannered and overly-polished.<br />If you're a died in the wool Stones fan, of course pick it up.  But if you're new and are thinking of this as a place to start or continue after getting Exile, be warned - this ain't no Exile.
055357342X|2.0|Martin knows how to write. He knows how to create living, interesting characters. But he doesn't know how to finish a plot, at least not in this series. \\"A Game of Thrones\\" was a really good book, \\"A Clash of Kings\\" wasn't, and \\"A Storm of Swords\\" was a terrible disappoinment altogether. Nothing is finished. At the end of the book, everything is a mess, plot threads going everywhere. Also, the quality of both plot and prose is declining steadily, making me think that Martin was in a hurry, had lost interest, or both. <BR>   When I had finished the book, I wished I had never read it. All it did was show me terror and cruel fate, killing of or destroying a number of good characters with hardly a shred of hope and light.<BR>  Also, it irritated me that the amount of sorcery, dragons, gods interfering et cetera increased all the time. In \\"A Game of Thrones\\", I was happy to read a fantasy that wasn't based on the regular concept of magic and religion. But at the end of \\"A Storm of Swords\\", I found myself in a typical Conan-like environment where the human choices mean less because of magical or divine forces that influence the outcome of every decision.<BR>   If Martin started to write this series with a plan in mind, I sure wish he had stuck to it. Instead, he has managed to write a series where the fabric of the world he has created slowly comes apart. It's tragical.
B000059QY3|3.0|Nothing about this La Traviata was bad, but I found it disappointing. I had heard so many good things about that perhaps my expectations were unreasonable. Having seen it less than a week ago, the only things I clearly remember liking were the sets, the costumes, and the guests dressed up as matadors in the second party scene. I do not wish to seem unjust, I did enjoy watching this version. I would not, however, recommend it to anyone. I much prefer the version from 2000, with Eteri Gvazava and Jose Cura.
0553579908|2.0|I read this book while under the impression that it was the second part of a trilogy. In trilogies, it's customary for the second book to be rather dark (so that the heroes can win against all odds in the end of book three). Because of this I wasn't surprised when \\"A Clash of Kings\\" described a bloody civil war, the torture of innocent villagers, murder, dark forces closing in, and so on. <BR>   Still, too little happens that actually develops the plot. Mostly, it gets more and more comlicated. Characters die, but many more are added. I read on, thinking that the first book in the series, \\"A Game of Thrones\\", was much better, and that part three would probably be better than this too. <BR>   In short, I had a feeling I was watching Martin's world slowly come apart. I hoped he knew what he was doing, but even so, I didn't find this book very enjoyable but quite a disappointment.
B00008J4P5|1.0|You must be a devoted follower to like this album. I can't understand how the same band can make Seven Nation Army - an excellent song - and combine it with 13 extremely bad pieces. It wasn't worth the money to buy this CD just for the one good song.
0553573403|3.0|&quot;A Game of Thrones&quot; is in many ways a great book. The characters really come alive, the fantasy environment is original and well described, and the book is written in good prose.<br /> The only thing that annoyned me when I read this book was a couple of technical problems. For instance, the author seems to know rather little about snow and cold climates. I live far to the north and couldn't help noticing a few things (like the way snow melts when there's blood on it) that weren't true to life.<br />  But apart from that, I truly enjoyed this book. I even decided it was so good that I didn't mind too much that the female characters were less colourful and interesting than the males.<br /><br />And yet, I give this book a mere three stars. Why? Because this is the start of a trilogy that ends in nowhere. The following two parts end in a mess of plot threads. There is a fourth book coming soon but after reading part three, I have low hopes for it and I'm pretty certain I won't read it. Whatever epic story Martin intended from the start, he dropped the ball before he had finished part two.<br />  If you want to read just this one book, go ahead. It's worth it, because &quot;A Game of Thrones&quot; is entertaining by itself. But if you want to read a story with a finish, buy another book.
B00008G9JM|1.0|1) It's a bit of a stretch to call this an oratorio. I never heard of an oratorio for a single voice or an oratorio without orchestral accompaniment. (Neither is it a concept album. A concept album is a collection of songs bound by a single conceit. This is ONE song, not a collection.)<br />2) Re: \\"The album was conceived for live performance, which included a short film of the album cover ballerina in action...\\" A film is anything but a live performance, and I can still remember how the audience groaned at the beginning of the  \\"Passion Play\\" concert; we wanted to see the BAND.<br />3) The recording quality of the original vinyl version of \\"A Passion Play\\" was superb. <br />4) The group's web site maintains that \\"A Passion Play\\"'s lyric is murky, probably because it didn't quite turn out as Ian Anderson intended. The finished form always made perfect and straightforward sense to me, but then I never had to compare it to its original conception. In any case, it is not \\"pretentious\\"; it is not putting on airs. It is a FANTASY, a set of eschatological conjectures.
B00005JLEU|5.0|Needless to say, this is a FANTASTIC film -- my favorite anime of all time.  Deep and light at the same time, it stands as high art.<br />And, yes, the DVD has the original Japanese language track with subtitles (if you want them), as well as the Disney english dub (not bad, though Chihiro's voice grates on me) and a French dub as well.  I strongly prefer the original language audio with english subs -- same can be said for just about any anime.
B00008G9JO|1.0|If this group had disbanded after \\"Passion Play\\" it would be recalled fondly even today. Instead it's recalled as an embarrassment lumbering through the decades--to the extent it's recalled at all. <br />Ad rem, however: The title song's music is a very slight derivative folkish sort of thing (closely resembling Linda Ronstadt's rendition of...\\"and I think I'm gonna' love him for a long, long time\\", in fact--whatever that's called) that cannot support the verbosity and preciousness of the lyric saddled on its back. It just isn't a \\"heavy\\" enough horse, so to speak. Then there are these utterly banal (musically at least as much as lyrically) lines: \\"Now you're down to the few/And there's no work to do/The tractor is on its way.\\" Banal middle sections mar the only other promising songs, \\"One Small Mouse\\" and \\"Moths\\", as well--though \\"Moths\\" is also marred by gratuitous unmusical and obnoxious key changes. The rest is sludge.
B00007E8V4|5.0|this is an amazing CD. well, what would u expect from SOAD? this is a CD compiled of all of their previously recorded unrealesed material.<br />1. Chic'n'Stu: (6/10), really short, still pretty good. Serj sings a slow solo in the middle.<br />2. Innervision: (10/10), defintely one of the best songs on this album. amazing guitar, amazing bass, which ties beautifully into the drum beats. Serj's deep voice matches it perfectly. backup from Daron at parts.<br />3. Bubbles: (8/10), pretty fast paced. really fast guitar riffs...really good. its kinda short though.<br />4. Boom!: (8/10), he sort of speaks in the verses in this song, its an anti-war song. (not against any specific war, but just in general) a great chorus, a song for pacifists. once again really fast guitar riffs, acompanied by fast drums.<br />5. Nuguns: (8/10), i really love the intrumentals in this song. Overall a pretty good song.<br />6. A.D.D.(american dream disorder): (9/10) really great. <br />7. Mr.Jack: (10/10) this song is sort of sad. but i love it. long intro, great though. Serj's voice is accomanpied by Daron's,  its almost hypnotizing at times... amazing. its the longest song on the CD, a little over 4 minutes.<br />8. I-E-A-I-A-I-O: (9/10), really really fast paced. its almost like a tongue twister. but i love it for this...and the chorus sounds tribal. really great song. upbeat.<br />9. 36: (5/10) its just a filler, not too bad though.<br />10. Pictures: (7.5/10) pretty good, not amazing though.<br />11. Highway song: (9/10) defintely one of my favorites. I LOVE the guitar in the chorus.<br />12. F**k the System: (8.5/10) pretty good, its been floating around the internet for a while now. they repeat the chorus a lot, and Serj makes some pretty kick A%$ noises in it.<br />13. Ego Brain: (9.5,10) One of the slower song of the album. yet another of those songs where Serj's voice almost hypnotizes you. Its pretty soft, until the chorus which is quite hard. but its a nice mix.<br />14. Thetawaves: (8.5,10) pretty good, nothing special, still something i like.<br />15. Roulette: (10,10) amazing. it almost puts me into a trance. there are no drums in it however, which i didnt notice for a while....but its just amazing. i could sit and listen to this song over and over again.<br />16. Streamline: (9.5,10) really good aswell. Faster, harder chorus, then it slows down to slightly softer verses. a really good song, sort of a love song. (an original one though. not all mushy and typical [STUFF])<br />truly an amazing album. must have.
B00008G9JN|1.0|I'm tempted to rate this higher. I'm tempted to overlook the occasional banality of its music and lyrics (\\"So, Come on, I'm the whistler\\", \\"Or will these changing times, motor cars, power lines keep us apart?\\", the instrumental interlude in the title song, the tedious flute and electric guitar introduction to \\"Pibroch\\", etc.) I'm tempted to forget that Ian Anderson sings, well, woodenly throughout, as if he is less convinced in this record's worth than I. Never mind: This is a pleasant and innocuous record, if very far from brilliant. (If it takes you more than three plays or so to assimilate I have to wonder about you.) It is certainly much better than the Tulls surrounding it, better than \\"Heavy Horses\\", better than the dreadful \\"Too Old to Rock and Roll, Too Young to Die\\", better than the vapid \\"WarChild\\". In fact it is something of an oasis in a post-\\"Passion Play\\" desert. <br />What especially interests me about it, however,--and I don't know quite what to make of this--is that it is all riff. Riffs are juxtaposed; riffs are superposed. There is no improvisation whatsoever, no instrumental \\"solos\\". Even the vocals are mostly riffing: the interminable reiteration (interrupted once with the banal lyric partially quoted above) of \\"Jack in the Green\\" is a case in point. Hmm... <br />As for the alleged \\"remastering\\": The original recording was fine. This is less than fine. As for the \\"bonus tracks\\": I'm all for live recordings, but a live version of a song on the same record with the studio version is (let's put it charitably) a very B-A-D idea.
B000003TAR|5.0|IN utero is alot of things, brilliant, enraged and thoutghtful. But more than anything, its the triumph of the will. it loses .5 cuz it took me a while to understand the lyrics.
B00008PW3Q|5.0|I thought I'd take a trip down memory lane.  Not so much that the music would be good but I'd occasionally remember a song from the past.  What a surprise!!!  The same harmony.  The same instrumental sound.  The same group that I heard many years ago.  Another nice treat is an 18 song album, much more than the 13 to 14 average.  I think they just couldn't figure out which ones to cut so keep them all.  A very good decision.  I may have to head out to the Fleetwood Mac Tour..... I'll drive the bus.
B000001OAA|5.0|This is an amazing record, and it's hard to believe it was only their first.  There are so many different styles of music on here, ranging from the classic pop of &quot;Stupid Girl&quot; to the darkly sinister &quot;As Heaven Is Wide&quot;.  It also has an incredible opener ... once you hear the first four rapid drumbeats of &quot;Supervixen&quot;, you'll be instantly hooked right through these 12 perfectly crafted tracks.  There's something for everybody here.  Check it out.
B00006879E|4.0|When I first heard &quot;Harder To Breath&quot; one day while swapping Cds casually with a classmate, I was intrigued by the natural, well-done combination of rock and funk elements. Curious, I got the album, and am happy to say, this CD really pulls off the unique blend. Adam's vocals are top-notch, and his back-ups create a nice, smooth feel on the entire album. The only reason I gave this CD 4 out of 5 is because of the idea behind the lyrics; an entire album (except for the first track) being about an ex-girlfriend reminds me of a typical pop band lamenting a relationship they didn't have. Surprisingly, Maroon 5 makes this idea sound good. Great vocals, awesome guitar playing and nice, ambient drums make this album a great buy, and Maroon 5 a band to watch.
B00005QXDD|5.0|I first heard this from a friend while he was playing his guitar. The first song, Tribute, was addictive immediatly. I watched the music video roughly 50 times in one day. I came back to my friends the next day and stumbled through the song, yet I knew it! Within a week, I was learning all the songs. I have had the cd for nearly a month, and I am STILL listening to them in wonder. So many tracks, so vile, so sick. Yet so amazing and funny! I will burst out laughing while I hum it in class. Maybe people think I'm psycho, but so are Kyle and Jack, so to say. I would recommend this for everyone, unless you don't like vulgor speech or topics. IT sure isn't any cd for cranky old men and women to sit back and knit to. Unless they're deaf! I think that this is an interesting arrangment of songs that need to be heard more!

0783226063|1.0|Dune is my favorite book. This is one of the worst book to movie adaptations I have ever seen. Fans of the book will notice many glaring inaccuracies, the story speeds by in a blur of confusion and everything seems rushed. The Sardaukar uniforms look like the came out of a a childrens' cartoon mixed with a nuclear powerplant. If you like Dune, skip this mess and buy the superior Sci-Fi channel six hour-long epic. If Frank Herbert saw this, he would be disgusted.

His acoustic rendition of \\"Big Love\\" was lovely.  Here he repeats that  renditiion on almost every track.  And where are John and Mick?  With countless percussion overdubs, it's hard to find Fleetwood's tight playing style, or McVie's warm bass lines.   A stripped down album that focused on  strong melodies, mature lyrics, and simplicity might have made a lot more sense.  The last two tracks are definitely the best songs on the CD, possibly because they provide relief after 16 tracks of mediocrity.   I think \\"Beautiful Child\\" is the most elegant rock song ever recorded. Unfortunately that was almost 25 years ago.

B00006ADFL|5.0|\\"How can these heavenly creatures be real?\\" asks Pauline in one scene of \\"Heavenly Creatures,\\" the exquisite and horrifying docudrama of a real-life murder in New Zealand. Peter Jackson uses spectacular special effect, great actors, and outstanding direction to show us how these heavenly creatures became monsters.<br /><br />In 1952, Pauline Parker (Melanie Lynskey) is a loner at her proper New Zealand school, until the day Juliet Hulme (Kate Winslet) arrives -- an intelligent, witty, daring girl who appeals to Pauline. They share a love of the arts, writing, sculpting, drawing, fantasy, and tenor Mario Lanza. Soon the two of them are nearly inseparable, spinning their fantastical tales of castles, knights, unicorns and beautiful ladies. (The foremost ladies, Deborah and Gina, are modelled on themselves) Even Juliet's four month stint in the hospital doesn't separate the girls through their letters and shared fantasies. But soon Juliet's father (Clive Merrison) becomes concerned that their close friendship is \\"unhealthy.\\" It is, but not just in the way he thinks.<br /><br />The two girls' emotional attachment has turned incredibly intense, so that they barely think of anyone but each other, and the fantasy stories begin to seep into reality for them . Pauline drops out of school and stops talking to her parents; Juliet learns that her mother is sleeping with one of her clients, and that her parents are divorcing. Now she's being sent to South Africa, and there is no telling when she will see Pauline again. Unless they do something about their parents so that they can stay together... such as murder.<br /><br />Peter Jackson kicks off \\"Heavenly Creatures\\" by emphasizing what a beautiful, in most ways peaceful country (via a cheesy 1950s documentary). But he rapidly shows that beauty is not everything  -- the complex and beautiful fantasy land of Borovnia has a sort of amorality in its stories, that reflects the girls' own minds. Their mothers are problematic -- one is selfish, the other is controlling -- but the girls begin to see them as mere obstacles to be dealt with. Jackson doesn't just show what the two did, but showed why they did it. But even then, he doesn't sugarcoat anything.<br /><br />Melanie Lynskey is excellent as Pauline; she has something of the look of both a child and a woman, switching between smiles and sullenness, depending on who she's speaking to. And the luminous Kate Winslet plays the somewhat devil-may-care Juliet, whose vivacity and charm overrule any of Pauline's reservations. \\"It's everyone else who's bonkers!\\" she says gleefully when Pauline casts doubt on her own sanity. The supporting actors are also good, especially Clive Merrison and Honora Peirse as Juliet's dad and Pauline's mom, who are both concerned about their children.<br /><br />The dialogue is outstanding, both chilling and simple (\\"Our main idea for the day was to murder Mother\\"; \\"we decided to use a rock in a stocking, rather than a sandbag...\\").  And Richard Taylor's handling of the CGI and prosthetics is oustanding. One particularly vivid scene has a hillside transforming into an exquisite garden. And nobody except Peter Jackson could have pulled off the idea of including living clay figurines or four-foot-wide butterflies, but somehow it not only works, but adds to the surreality of the story. Jackson's unique camerawork is here as well; if you enjoy his swooping shots and close-ups, then this will be a treat to watch.<br /><br /> The DVD is pretty bare-bones, unfortunately, without a \\"making of\\" or director's commentary -- or much of a look at the real-life events of this film. There are some trailers for other movies, and the trailer for this one as well. (Which is not so amazing because it wobbles a little as it played)<br /><br />While Juliet went on to become bestselling murder mystery writer Anne Perry, no one is entirely certain what happened to Pauline. This movie is frighteningly vivid, beautifully made, and exquisitelydirected, destined to  be a modern classic.

If you like slapstick and gross out humor watch this film, this is where American Pie and the like got it's start. A great classic and one of the best Lampoon movies.
B000000WJZ|5.0|Billy Corgan's peak was when he made Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness. Siamese Dream preceeded Mellon Collie and Siamese Dream was more band-based (as opposed to the variation in MC&amp;IS). What I mean by this is that SP based their music more on guitar/bass/drums, with the exception if &quot;Disarm&quot; which in my view is the most standout track on this album. This was a successful album partly because of the three hits &quot;Cherub Rock&quot;, &quot;Today&quot;, and &quot;Disarm&quot;. The more you listen to this album, the more you appreciate it. Siamese Dream is worth paying the 15 bucks for, unlike a lot of the [expletive] people are buying nowadays.
B00005JLH3|5.0|I won't lie and say that this movie is the best movie of the year, or even the best teen drama. What it was was and entertaining movie. I won't explain the plot here, but be assured it is formulatic and flowed with ease out of some hollywood writers pen. What makes this movie fun is the drumming, the choreography and the small look into the life of a marching band, a subject not touched on to much. the performances were pretty strong, the music fine and fit the movie. Orlando Jones did a great job as the band leader. If you've never seen drumming as something cool watch this film and have your mind changed.

B00006CXXU|4.0|She made us wait a long time for this cd but it was worth it. The songs are so great and she has such a great voice. I'm rating 4 stars instead of 5 becase of Make Over and all the Interludes.
B000083E79|4.0|I have to say, I am only 15 and, while I am not the most experienced Cher fan, even I know that THE WAY OF LOVE and WE ALL SLEEP ALONE (Remix) aren't here. And what about her WALKING IN MEMPHIS? These, most definitely the former 2, instead of, say, ONE BY ONE, SAVE UP ALL YOUR TEARS, or ALL OR NOTHING would have been better here. Those particular three are far less essential, though great hits, than THE WAY OF LOVE and WE ALL SLEEP ALONE (Remix). Also, the way the songs were all thrown into a mixed bag and then placed in a random order isn't too strategic either-they should have had them either go all backwards or forwards in order of single release, preferably forwards from 1965 through 2002. One last thing, it's a real shame that ALIVE AGAIN wasn't promoted and made a single and included here. It would have very much enhanced the disc. It was the best track off LIVING PROOF, and it deserved better than to be quickly released as a single and then quickly forgotten in some obscure European countries. We need some remixes of it! She didn't even sing it when I saw her in concert 7/02/02. She simply rushed through SONG FOR THE LONELY and A DIFFERENT KIND OF LOVE SONG and forgot her new CD. What a pity.<br />Still, the compilation is excellent. Besides THE WAY OF LOVE, WALKING IN MEMPHIS and WE ALL SLEEP ALONE (remix) it has everything you need of Cher's. I'm so glad she included HEART OF STONE, my personal favorite song of hers, even though it wasn't too big a hit, but I'm not surprised since she loves that song. I'm also glad that now I don't have to order the GREATEST HITS (Import) CD that I've meant to buy for so long but really that costs too much.<br />Some tracks also feel a little condensed , such as I FOUND SOMEONE, BELIEVE, and STRONG ENOUGH. These and a few others feel as if they move a little faster, though they are in fact original length. If they are indeed slightly remixed, then that is a good thing lest you must have EVERYTHING of Cher's. Also great is the addition of the Rodney Jerkin's fast remix of A DIFFERENT KIND OF LOVE SONG. A few months ago I purchased the A DIFFERENT KIND OF LOVE SONG Maxi CD Single (highly recommened) and this track, also on that single, quickly became my favorite version of the song. I was onto something-the record company liked that remix enough to include it on her new greatest hits compilation. I felt oddly complimented.<br />Anyway, a great buy no matter how you look at it, even with its flaws that can easily be corrected by burning your own disc and buying a couple others for hits not included (you'll need eBay or a European yard sale for the WE ALL SLEEP ALONE remix on CD). After all, it's Cher! If in your life you only purchase one CD of hers, let this be it, folks. This and the HEART OF STONE album. :)the addition of the Rodney Jerkin's fast remix of A DIFFERENT KIND OF LOVE SONG.

B000089RVX|5.0|If you want to accuse a band for sounding like another band please pick on someone less talented......Yes, this is hard rock/pop and yes Evanescence does have a female lead singer, but she doesn't sound like Christina from Lacuna Coil. Amy is more emotional and powerfull in her expression. I'm not saying she's better, merely different - say if Christina is water then Amy is fire.......<br />As for the bands talent....you have to be genius to make catchy uplifting sing a long songs about for instance suicide and still keep it trustwothy. This is by no means superficial pop. This is deep and truely emotional pop music and that is almost a contradiction.....SPOOKY<br />I am not particular religious, but I think it's cool that they are because it certaintly shines through and gives the dark and often pessimistic lyrics an optimistic lifewilling approach.<br />Favorite songs: ALL, but if I have to choose one it would have to be &quot;Tourniquet&quot;

I figured 18 songs, coming off their latest gem DANCE, so what if Christine McVie is missing?

On the first couple of listens, I was bored until the fifth track &quot;Miranda.&quot; I can live with the overproduction, but there just seems to be a rhythm and flow missing to many of the songs, and the CD in general.  I'm not sure what Lindsey was going for in some of these tracks as there seem to be misplaced guitar solos thrown in or drawn out to just lengthen some songs.  Don't get me wrong, he's an extremely talented musician, but I found some of the tracks like &quot;Red Rover&quot; to be absolutely awful, and &quot;Come&quot; is a hard rocker that seems thrown together as an experiment. Too many like these feel like filler numbers that the group just didn't want to leave out. &quot;Bleed to Love Her&quot; was already done with a much better effort live on DANCE. Some of the more mellow tracks sung by Nicks seem to lack much passion and had me losing interest like &quot;Silvergirl, Ilume, Peacekeeper, and Smile At You.&quot;  The techno-synthesizer sound from the mid-80's was thrown in on a couple of songs that had me wishing Christine McVie was more involved on this CD.<BR>    <BR>  The liner notes mention Ms. McVie and Sheryl Crow among others as additional performers, although it's hard to tell which they played on. On a positive note, I found the better songs to be &quot;Miranda, What's the World Coming To, Say You Will, Running Through the Garden, and Goodbye Baby.&quot; If you're a longtime fan looking for radio friendly hits on this CD, you'll be disappointed.  I applaudthe band for seeking a new direction here, but it is clearly not their best effort.
B000021YQV|5.0|System's best CD yet!! It doesn't have the same feel of either of their other albums. Their self-titled CD was too dark, and, while still awesome, Steal This Album was full of B-sides and other useless songs.<br />Prison Song: 7.5/10 I liked it at first, but it got annoying after awhile. Gives you the wrong impression of this CD.<br />Needles: 9/10 A definite improvement over the first track, and gives you the first sense of this album's true nature.<br />Deer Dance: 10/10 Awesome. Wonderful chorus. Love the guitar riffs, too.<br />Jet Pilot: 8/10 Strange lyrics, great song.<br />X: 8/10 Again, not as good as the track 2 or 3, but still good.<br />Chop Suey!: 10/10 Flawless. Incredible song. Seemed kinda strange the first time I heard it, but 2 or 3 listens and i fell in love. Great guitar riffs, wonderful drums, and tight acoustic guitar in the beginning.<br />Bounce: 8/10 a..um, song about a pogo stick. Funny how they say, \\"But just one pogo stick!\\" After a lot of the verses. Too short, though.<br />Forest: 9/10 Awesome lyrics, and great music, too. Fast chorus.<br />ATWA: 8.5/10 A song about a murderer, I think. Daron, the guitarist, sings a lot in this song. Great track.<br />Science: 9/10 Middle Eastern flavor in this one. Not bad.<br />Shimmy: 8.5/10 Wierd lyrics. I think Serj, the vocalist, wrote this on his own. Still good.<br />Toxicity: 10/10 Just as good as Chop Suey. LOVE the drum pattern. Chorus is great, too. System really put a lot of thought in this album. Probably why it took 3 years...<br />Psycho: 10/10 Yet again, another wonderful song. Serj changes his voice quick and surprises you when he says \\"PSYCHO! GROUPIE! COCAINE! CRAZY!\\" Funny song.<br />Aerials: 10/10 Awesome ending song. The lyrics fit it perfectly. Love it. <br />The last part of the album is the best part, with the last 3 tracks having perfect ratings. System took their time with this album, I just hope Their next CD will be better than Steal This Album. Overall, the minute you have13$ to spare, BUY TOXICITY!!! You won't regret it.

0380789035|3.0|An ex-con named Shadow is hired by a mysterious man named Wednesday (and if you know your etymology or classics, you kinow who he is) for a series of odd, and I do mean odd, jobs.  Soon Shadow's involved in a coming war between the old gods --- gods like Ananasi the spider, Ibis, and Kali, brought to America by the beliefs of immigrants --- and the new gods --- things people worship with thier time and interest, like TV, the Internet and cars.  It's an interesting premise, and Gaimain tries valiantly to make this a Great American Novel: it's a road trip (aren't they all?), uses small towns as its settings, and there's even a murder msytery of sorts.  Many reviews complain of 'sub-plots'; there really aren't any, just background material which help bring what's happening behind the scenes into clearer focus.  In all, it's a perfectly good fantasy read, though I must say I don't understand why it garners quite so much praise (and so many awards).  It's good like a Stephen King novel is good: not literature, but an enthralling fantasy / horror story.  On the minus side, Gaiman does get a bit bogged down in useless details (he just *had* to cram in the leprechan, and a few words about slavery, and *two* kinds of dead resurrection, and the Fates, and American Indian mythos, and, and...).  Also, for a book whose premise is that belief = power, Gaimain completely and unfortunately sidesteps the very pervasive and prominent Christian belief in America (it's not all goths, pagans and lesbians, you know, as nice as they are).  Finally, I do wish the book had shown a little bit more of the sly humor that was such a seft touch in Gaiman's 'Sandman.'  Shadow is cold and unsurprised by everything, which makes it hard for the reader to empathize with him and gives the entire book an overall impression of taking itself too seriously.  Come on, even the Dreaming himself showed a smile now and then.
B000003TAW|5.0|I was first turned onto Weezer by my cousin about 2 years after the blue album came out.  Boy, am I glad that happened.  I can honestly say that this is this best album that i own in my large collection of over 500 cd's.  From the beginning track of My Name is Jonas to the ending track of Only In Dreams, Weezer delivered the best album I've ever heard.  All of the tracks have their own catchy tune and can be listened to over and over again without being grown tired of.  If you don't own this cd yet, BUY IT.  You won't be disappointed. I can guarantee you that.
B00008J4P5|5.0|As a resident of Detroit, I was beginning to resent having the White Stripes shoved down my throat everywhere I turned. I owned their three previous albums, and although I found them enjoyable, and quite fun, was never stunned by anything they produced. Their live shows always impressed more - from the power of Meg's drumming to Jack's channelling of Robert Plant's voice, one could see that the duo had more power and talent than their albums suggested.<BR>All that changed with Elephant. There is literally not one unsatisfying song on this disk. Even the throwaway tunes - &quot;It's True that We Love One Another&quot; and Burt Bacharach's &quot;I Just Don't Know What to Do with Myeslf&quot; are pleasant.<BR>The sound here is more diverse from previous albums. &quot;Black Math&quot; ranges from Brit-Punk like the Buzzcocks to a bridge that channels Metallica. &quot;You've Got in Her in Your Pocket&quot; is a more meditative acoustic ballad. Additionally, the presence of a piano (a rarity on past albums) contributes greatly to several songs. Even Meg contributes vocals on &quot;Cold Cold Night&quot;, a slinky tune that you'd expect to hear in an old speak-easy. They have left many of their blues influences behind: with the exception of the superb &quot;Ball and Biscuit&quot;, the rest here is full throttle guitar rock harkening back to the classic rock era. Unlike many albums produced these days, this one is certainly worth the money.
0375414932|5.0|In Any Human Heart, William Boyd manages to create a not entirely likeable character, Logan Mountstuart, who nonetheless is an entirely sympathetic protagonist.  Logan is not the nicest person in the world.  He manipulates friends for his own amusement, sleeps with one of his closests friend's fiance, and commits a number of other, minor atrocities.  Yet for all Logan's badness, I missed him when I finished the novel and throughout, I found myself rooting for his finding some semblance of happiness.  Logan is entirely human in the sense that his story indeed could be the story of any human heart--any British heart is probably more like it.  He manages to come in contact with quite a few notables from the twentieth century and reinvents himself and his career many times over.  Perhaps no one lives a life as rich as Logan, maybe so.  But that still does not take away from the fact that Any Human Heart is a terrific novel, excellent storytelling.  Enjoy.

B0000028M7|5.0|In my oppinion this is THE BEST album to come from the<BR>grunge period. Although Kurt Cobain was an awesome song writer, Nirvana's music never was able to produce the sort of atmosphere that AIC achieved. What AIC achieved was pretty phenominal. They created an unrivaled atmosphere of despair and awe-inspiring instrumentals to back up layne stanley's deep and emotional voice. Although Layne is now dead (RIP), I can only hope that<BR>Alice In Chains will be recognised as the unique band that they were. <br />Essential record for any serious music fan.<br />Highlights: every song on the album!
0316666343|4.0|The whole premise, at first seemed a little contrived: A young victim of rape and murder watches the unfolding grief and anger from a heaven that sounds like Earth with no problems. Still, the characters drew me in, as their grief and anger took center stage, even as they tried to get on with their lives. Susie's father, in particular, seemed real and torn by his grief. Some have criticized the way her mother responds to the loss, but to me she sounds believable in the way she runs away from her grief. Perhaps it's because I can see such tendencies in myself. The scene with Ray and Susie/Ruth at the end was a little contrived, though it was really sweet and it would be nice to have something like that happen in real life. Ruth was a character who was a puzzle. Her motivations were never truly clear. But still, I loved the book and would read it again.

B00008PW3Q|5.0|Wow.  I have finally gotten to do a full listen to this CD and I am incredible impressed.  i thought it would be like the early days of Buckingham/Nicks but this is much more a Tusk-inspired CD and Tusk has always been my favorite FM CD.  This is not the &quot;Don't Stop&quot; or &quot;Dreams&quot; Fleetwood Mac that many expect, but rather its a group of incredibly talented people, taking risks and creating incredible music.  I am wondering -- could Murrow be a dance-club hit as a remix much like Planets of the Universe?  It would sound great on the dance floors.  And &quot;Smile at You&quot; -- what incredible vocals on that one.
B00004RF97|3.0|&quot;The Philadelphia Story&quot; concerns itself with Tracy Lord (Katherine Hepburn), a spoiled socialite scheduled to remarry when her first husband, C.K. Dexterhaven (Cary Grant)shows up to pitch some rice and mayhem.  Add to the mix, Mike Connor (James Stewart) a reporter who is supposed to be covering the wedding for the tabloids but winds up falling for Tracy himself.  <BR>The play on which the movie is based has an interesting backstory.  At this point in her career, for various reasons,  Katherine Hepburn had been branded &quot;box office poison&quot;. Unable to find suitable work in Hollywood, Ms. Hepburn decided to do the next best thing - get playwrite, Philip Barry to write her a hit.  And so he did.  The Broadway production of &quot;The Philadelphia Story&quot; was a phenomenal success.  However, when L.B. Mayer, the head of MGM, decided that he simply had to have the rights to the play he discovered that Barry didn't own them - Katherine Hepburn did.  Hence, the only way to make the movie was to cast box office poison in the lead.  What good fortune that he did, since the film revitalized Katherine Hepburn's image with the movie going public and launched her career through another six decades of wonderful performances.<BR>Now, about the DVD.  Warner Home Video has inherited another MGM Home Video import with &quot;The Philadelphia Story&quot;.  Having said that, this one's pretty good looking.  Yes, there is fine grain, dirt, scratches and aging present throughout. There's also some rare instances of edge enhancement and shimmering details.  But these are minute and do not distract one from enjoying this fantastic film.  The gray scale (it's a B&amp;W movie) is well balanced.  Contrast and shadow levels are accurately defined. The soundtrack is mono as originally recorded.  At times there is a slight background hiss that crops up but overall, the audio is remarkably well represented.  There are no extras.<BR>BOTTOM LINE: YES.
B00004W221|4.0|The only reason this movie has only 4 stars is because the newer version of Brian's Song has 5 and I bought these both at the same time. It doesn't quite match the unparalleled sorrow of Brian's Song but Rudy is a great story of triumph rather than sorrow. All Rudy wants to do is play football for the Fighting Irish. After being told all of his life that he's too small and too inexperienced, he finally gets into Notre Dame. Now it's time to try for this once in a lifetime chance to play football for the team of his dreams. This movie is a definite if you want a collection of the classics of the past few decades. I definitely don't regret spending my money on it.
B00000724P|5.0|Without doubt, my favourite Metallica album. ...And Justice For All is definitely Metallica's most technical and progressive album - full of odd time and key changes. Hetfield's lyrics are flawless as is his frantic guitar work, keeps in time with drummer Ulrich's double-kick. Hammett's brilliant solos stand testament to the emense talent exuded by the guitarist.<br />Musically, the album is flawless... it's fast, heavy and intricate as would be expected from Metallica. I don't know why people complain about the production on this album, I have NEVER had a problem with hearing Jason Newsted's bass (a common complaint). All the songs on the album are brilliant however standout include \\"Blackened\\", \\"Harvester Of Sorrow\\" and the amazing \\"One\\", the nightmare inducing ballad that tells of a maimed soldier in pain after a war and unable to die...<br />BRILLIANT!!
B000002LEE|5.0|This album is perfection personified. I recall the feelings I had when I first heard this album and now know what people felt like when they first heard \\"Revolver\\" from the Beatles. This album single handedly changed the way I listened to music. Changed everything I should expect from music. This album was/is daring, energetic and dangerous. It showed you the world thru these four people's eyes. Just looking at the cover tells you there is something different about this album. It came out during the \\"hair metal\\" days. It was nothing like what was around then. I loved it, the non-cookie cutter sound to it. Each song on this album flows together very well. \\"Up the beach\\" starts this bad boy off, it's basically a semi-instumental track with the only vocals being \\"hooome\\". That leads you to \\"Ocean Size\\" and \\"Had a Dad\\" two rockers. Then the highlight of the album comes up \\"Ted Just Admit It...\\" its the bands take on TV, media, violence, sex and drugs. Its a great song. It still gives me chills to this day. \\"Standing in The Shower Thinking\\" is the next tune which is basically just that, a song about when you get in the shower and think about things. \\"Summertime Rolls\\" the slowed down, tripped out love song is next, this song also is a highlight of the album. \\"Mountain Song\\" from the opening bass lick you know you're in for a treat on this song. \\"Idiots Rule\\" you'd have to listen to this one yourself to see what its about. I know what its about but I think everyone should at least hear it and make their own judgement. \\"Jane Says\\" if you haven't heard this one I'm very surprised. \\"Thank You Boys\\" is your one minute breather until the you get to the studio version of \\"Pigs In Zen\\", which closes the album. This track has so much energy and angst to it. Its seemingly about to explode at any moment but never does. Anyway if you've read this far you may be interested in buying this album. My suggestion is buy it. Lay down somewhere turn this album on as loud as you can stand, get your self your favorite drink and just drift away.
B000083E79|4.0|Cher has been around for almost 40 years now and they attempted to fit her best work onto one cd, they should've made this a double cd release like Warner did with Fleetwood Mac.  This cd is supposed to match The Living Proof Tour, it does to an extent, The Way Of Love is not included on this album but was performed in the tour, and the 1987 version of Bang Bang is the version performed on the tour, but the original version that Sonny Bono produced is the version you will hear on this album.<br />I'm not saying this album isn't worth it, it is worth it, but they could've packaged it better and made it a double cd, some very noteworthy songs are excluded from this package such as The Way of Love, We All Sleep Alone, D'ove L'amore, Love and Understanding just to name a few....<br />Another reason the cd does not get five stars is because of the remix of Different Kind of Love Song included on the album instead of the dancey album version.<br />I recommend this cd for just a simple collection of her work, but it certainly leaves out some of the very best.
B00005JLF5|4.0|I love the series, a favorite from beginning to end, and I love having the episodes on DVD.<br />BUT while trying to introduce the series to my partner who's never seen it, I noted NUMEROUS SPOILERS throughout the Season 1 special features.  Unlike  The Next Generation special features that go SEASON BY SEASON (and so we watched them together), this one projects forward to scenes from &quot;You Are Cordially...&quot; and other major series SPOILING episodes, in almost ALL PARTS of the special features.  Luckily I caught them before it ruined some of the great joy of the series for her, those twists and turns, hookups and disappointments.<br />It seems the producers decided DS9 didn't merit a well-crafted season by season retrospective like The Next Generation did, so they spoiled some of the great revelations and events in the series.  VERY DISAPPOINTING.  Such a series-wide view is appropriate, but only for the Final Season, not the first, in my opinion.  (The &quot;crew dossiers&quot; might be excepted from the spoiler concern (as they only have 7 discs to put them on, but at least the other features should be clean.  Also, FYI, I've only seen one spoiler in TNG Special features, Season 2, a magazine cover behind Worf that mentions &quot;You Are Cordially...&quot;  They did a much better job on the TNG special features.)<br />The Epidosdes themselves, however are wonderful.  Season 1 builds so many of the pieces that are set into true motion later on in the series, but it's still an exceptional achievement.  One of the top Treks, or even top television series, to be produced in modern television, from first season to the last.  <br />Hopefully, Paramount will correct its mistake for the later DVDs, so new people or some of us who forget easily will still be surprised when we reach the later seasons and watch again how everything plays out.
B00008PW3Q|5.0|This album is an amazing return to the brilliant work Fleetwood Mac possessed decades ago.  Stevie Nicks shines on this album as she always does, Lindsey has his moments, but Stevie clearly dominates this album.<br />The absence of Christine McVie is somewhat noticeable but they make up for that with 18 brilliantly produced tracks.<br />The highlights on this album for me would be<br />Illume (9/11), Thrown Down, Peacekeeper, Say You Will, Come, What's The World Coming To, Smile at You, Running Through The Garden, Silver Girl, Steal Your Heart Away, Destiny Rules.<br />An amazing effort from the Mac to keep you listening for years to come.
B00008J4P5|5.0|listening to this cd is like jumping into a hot hot tub. its shocking and almost painful but after a minute it feels really good. i loved white blood cells. everything came together well in that cd, meg's drums, jack's guitar and vocals. so i was excited for this cd. initially, i was dissappointed. it didnt have the instant pleasers like white blood cells did. but by now (i've had it maybe 3 days) i love it. i've even grown to like cold, cold night even though i normally have a predujice against that type of song. Elephant is a great cd. buy it. i recomend &quot;girl, you have no faith in medicine&quot; &quot;seven nation army&quot; &quot;black math&quot; &quot;i just dont know what to do with myself&quot; and &quot;i want to be the boy...&quot; the entire cd is worth buying. now the only thing left to do is figure out if jack and meg and brother and sister or ex-husband and wife................
B00008LDPU|5.0|I was able to see several episodes of \\"The Animatrix\\" on-line.  In a word:  Wow!  GET THIS DVD OR YOU WILL BE SORRY YOU DIDN'T!  \\"The Second Renaissance, Parts 1 & 2\\", probably the best among the nine episodes, are the prequel stories to \\"The Matrix\\" movies.  See it and you will understand \\"What is the Matrix\\".  \\"The Animatrix\\" is definitely one of the 10 best DVD's of 2003.

B00007AJGH|5.0|I originally saw previews & working scenes for the upcoming 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit' waaaay back in late 1984. This was on a 'Disney channel' special & the next 4 years had me curious of WHAT it would be like. Finally, in June 1988, it was released and the 'classic animation boom' trend had begun [leaving us with shows like 'The Simpsons' & numerous 'Hanna-Barbera' 'Disney' & other 'revival' cartoons in it's wake]. OK, I'll shut-up now about the origin & history trivia.[:-)]<BR>The 1989 VHS release was nice, but WOW! -- This 2 DVD set is movie-release marketing AT IT'S BEST! Not just having two versions of the film [full frame & letter box] but all the extra's! I won't list them since all my fellow 'Roger' enthusiasts have already done a great job! Having 'Benny the Cab' take YOU on a tour of the town & studio is also weird & hilarious! It's really cool to see the infamous 'deleted Pig-Head scene' also [previously only known to us who bought 'art-books' etc. on this subject]. The 'tunnel' into 'Toon Town' is also more recognizable in THIS scene [I always wondered where it was filmed!] and is clearly the small 'tunnel' in Griffith Park, Hollywood Hills. [Unfortunately the tunnel in 'real life' doesn't take you to 'Toon Town', but the other side of the 'Observatory entrance' AND it isn't a mile long! ...aww gee-wiz!]  <BR>As another reviewer said, this film won several awards AND was a huge hit at the box office back then -- which caused me to hope they'd make a 'sequel', but never did. After seeing the interviews with the people who made the film, one of them [sorry, I forgot his name] said how 'difficult' it was to make, so I guess that answers MY question! [:-)]<BR>Anyway, this is a VERY NICE home video release. Hollywood owes most of it's fame to great films like THIS one!
B00008PW3Q|1.0|I'm sorry.  I had waited so long for this reassembled group's return to recording (unfortunately minus Christine McVie)...and wanted so much to love \\"Say You Will.\\"  I think I would have bent over backwards and overlooked a great deal to call this new project a success...but I just cannot.<br />The magnetic energy and infectious melodies of Fleetwood Mac's earlier works like the self-titled white album, \\"Rumours\\" and even the often experimental \\"Tusk\\" are sadly absent here.  Truth be told, with few exceptions (\\"Bleed to Love Her\\", for example) there just aren't any great and lasting melodies here.  When you recall old Mac tracks like \\"Storms\\", \\"Don't Stop\\", \\"Never Going Back Again\\" and \\"Landslide\\" you realize that none of the new tracks from \\"Say You Will\\" elevate one's soul into the stratosphere or necessarily carry the listener on any unique musical or lyrical journey.<br />There is a great deal of focus and attention spent here on technique and virtuosity (namely Lindsey Buckingham's often amazing guitar playing), and an equal amount of time spent on overproduction and unnecessary electronic tampering with the mixes.  I realize that the group may have felt that in order to successfully step into the new musical millennium they needed to electronically update their already uniquely contemporary sound, but it comes off sounding like a gimmick....artifical and unnatural for them.<br />Sadly, the bottom line is that the songs are just not that musically memorable.  After 15 or 16 tracks they all begin to sound the same as there is limited musical variation.  Beware...there is also a great deal of noise here...such as on the last few minutes of track two.  Very unpleasant and just plain noise!
0786868694|5.0|As a professional working chef. I've been impressed by Nigella Lawson approach to food, for several reason, like her I am Italian ( she is part italian but both our mothers are) Also for those people who think professional chef's cook at home like we do at work, HAHAHAHA fat chance, how often we come home and are satisfied by the cool simplicty of a bowl of cereal or a ham and cheese sandwhich. But since I have discovered Nigella my hame and cheese sandwhich has be morphed into her Mozzarella in Carroza ( Carroza means carriage dont ask I dont get it either)I just added some ... ham I got from the deli section of my local market. and it is good!, her recipies are all about the comfort and joy of what cooking should be, its not about food art which so many literary chef's seems to feel their dishes need to be, Not Nigella, her dinner parties are great no fancy dishes just a table set with warm candles alot of happy people great food and love ( thats an italian for you) Ive made almost all of the recipies in her book. The Chocolate Cake is incredible and easy to make.The Sticky toffee pudding is easy and incredible and I took her Ginger Jam bread pudding to work and it became a dessert for the days special and we sold out of it like you cannot imagine, its just really easy yummy simple food. The Salmon over the fresh greens is great the entire section called \\"Temple Food\\" is full of wonderful simple and mainly asian in flavor and low calorie dishes that comfort and soothe. The book has some clever names, I gotta admit trashy still cracks me up Ive made the fried peanut butter and banana sandwhich several time afte work with a tall ice cold glass of non fat moo( milk to y'a'll) its total yum! The Warm thai duck salad is easy and simple to make and excellent with thinly sliced london broil if you cant find duck. The Pasta and Meatballs is great, if you dont want to make your own pasta De Cecco Fettucini or Tagliatelli  is a perfect subsitute. The Ham and Coca Cola and Sweet Corn pudding are tasty and perfect for the upcoming easter weekend. her recepies are simple and easy to follow, when I bought this book I bought it before it came out here, I got the UK version all in metric, I had to rely on my cooking school conversions but since its now available here, no conversions needed.  Im amazed how much I go back to this book when I want to have some people over and throw something together that easy relaxed comforting and fun. Oh yeah the spiced nuts , make em for a party they will be gone in a flash they are so good. I just ordered her new book forever summer I look forward to that. I also hope style channel starts showing that series. Ive checked it out on her website over in England and it has the recepies available there according to color? I dont know what the deal is with the colors yet but Im sure I will find out when the book gets here

B000002V0Q|4.0|Okay, so its not classic Megadeth, but its still pretty darn good. Has some great solos, but doesn't have the great riffs of RIP or Peace Sells.  With the exception of Ashes In Your Mouth, there is no absolutely amazing Megadeth song, which seemed to be odd, as most 'Deth albums had one or two of them (Peace Sells: Peace Sells, SFSGSW?: In My Darkest Hour , RIP: Holy Wars, Hangar 18, Youthanasia: Train of Consequences).<br />1. Skin O' My Teeth: Not bad at all, good solo, decent riffs, reminds of \\"Liar\\" a little bit, overall good song, just a bit too generic.  Also one heck of a solo by Marty Friedman in here.<BR>Rating: B+<br />2. Symphony of Destruction: Definitelty a song to love, and one of the best choruses by Megadeth of all time. The verse, nothing special, but the prechorus and chorus are simply outstanding.<BR>Rating: B+<br />3. Architecture of Aggression: Another solid song, but still nothing amazing.  Contains some great soloing as well, following a similar pattern as the previous songs.<BR>Rating: B+<br />4. Foreclosure of a Dream: I love the opening riff in this song, the lyrics are good, and Dave's voice absolutely shines in this song.<BR>Rating: B<br />5. Sweating Bullets: This version=horrible.  Live version=GREAT SONG.  If you want to like this song, get Rude Awakening and be prepared to love.  This version just doesn't cut it, too slow, choppy, and some of Daves WORST singing...<BR>Rating: (studio=D+; Live=A-)<br />6. This Was My Life: Wow, a very good song yet again, featuring some sweet riffs, which really show what Youthanasia is going to be, in a way.  But Youthanasia is far more toned down than this song in a way, but still, this is a great song.<BR>Rating: B+<br />7. Countdown to Extinction: SUPER slow, and just way too depressing for me.  After hearing this song, I want to kill myself because I get so depressed...ugh, skip this one.  However, it does a great job of displaying the intended message of the album and song.<BR>Rating: C+<br />8.High Speed Dirt: Supersong, good singing, great riffs, and a super awesome pre-chorus riff!  Sure, it may seem cheesy, but so what if the riffs are awesome, and Dave's voice is at its best here.<BR>Rating: A-<br />9. Psychotron: Okay, so kinda odd and cheesy, but still not THAT bad as some may say.  The chorus is double cheesy, though.<BR>Rating: C<br />10. Captive Honour: Sweet court section, then the actual song is great too, just the very beginning is kinda dumb, the riffs in the main part of the song are cool.<BR>Rating: C+<br />11. Ashes In Your Mouth: This song is good, the beginning on the live version is better, but the rest of song studio version is superior. Great main riffs, chorus is spectacular, very organised, near flawless song, plus AWESOME solos.  Daves voice is very good here, plus the main riffs are absolutely great!<BR>Rating: A+<br />Yea, get it now!!!!!!!
039472903X|5.0|This is one of those rare books everyone ought to have to read.  Like &quot;The Elements of Style,&quot; &quot;Writing That Works, and &quot;Profiles in Courage.&quot;  I had read this book back in 1990 when I was out of work, looking for a job in advertising.  The advertising job never happened for me and I moved on to other things.<br />I did not realize, until I recently picked up a copy to re-read, how much it had influenced me the first time I read it.  Half of the way I conduct myself at work and a lot of my thought processes and strategy is still influenced by what is in this book.  I make over 6 times what I made back in 1991.  I realize now I have Mr. Ogilvy to thank for a great deal of that.<br />Read this book.  At least once.
B00008J2DQ|3.0|Very rarely do I ever complain about a band putting out an album that sounds too much like the previous ones.  If you know my history, I am a very easy person to please when it comes to music.  I almost never trash anything unless there is a deep-rooted hatred somewhere.<br />That being said, I was let down by Godsmack's new release, \\"Faceless.\\"  It just sounds way too similar to the other two albums.  When I was listening to this disk, I was convinced that I had put \\"Awake\\" in my stereo instead of \\"Faceless,\\" but no, it was indeed \\"Faceless.\\"  Is it a good album?  I think it's all right, but that's not a very big compliment coming from me.<br />It's a shame, because I think this band has a lot of potential, but failed to use it all on this album.  Everything sounds the same; the guitars, the song writing, the singing, everything.  They use the same formula and structure that we've seen on the previous albums.  Now this isn't always a bad thing, but it would've been nice to see SOME change.  Sadly, there wasn't much that I heard.<br />Songs that I do like are \\"make me believe,\\" \\"faceless,\\" \\"I stand alone,\\" \\"re-align,\\" \\"I ****** hate you,\\" and \\"serenity.\\"  The others are all right, but those are the songs that stick out the most to me.<br />Will Godsmack fans be pleased with this release?  Hard to say.  If you want an album that sounds like the other two, then you will be very pleased.  If you're looking for some change, then you're going to be disappointed.  Is it a good album?  Yeah, it's decent.  But \\"decent\\" isn't what Godsmack can do.  They're better than this, or at least I think so.
B00008PW3Q|5.0|New albums by veteran rock stars often stink (a.k.a rolling stones, Aerosmith and list of others) but this one does not. There is a lot of good work on this album that anyone would be proud of and a new vitality.<br />I'm especially surprised at how much I like Stevie Nicks on this album. Her songs and the music backing her are extremely strong (a cross between the Wild Heart and Tusk). I don't know how anyone could deny the power of Smile at You, Illume, Destiny Rules, Running  through the garden & Say You Will unless you just don't like her voice.  And I've never heard her do a retro-song like Everybody Finds Out.<br />I not as surprised with Lyndsey because he's such a good musician. I really like Bleed to Love Her, Steal Your Heart Away, Miranda-classic Mac.<br />I miss Christine, but I can't fault them for her absence. There are so many [bad] albums out there; when a good one comes along, especially from a group that everyone thought was washed-up, it needs to be applauded and listened too.
B000002LRX|5.0|When you think of FNM most people think of their smash hit \\"Epic\\" and if thats the only song you've heard from them you might be a little confused how the style changed from 80s into a more experimental sound. Angel Dust is a fun, dark, and wacky ride of good Rock music. I think Mike Patton showed how creative FNM can be and he surely proved it with Angel Dust. This is a must for anyone who enjoys experimental rock music. Buy this you wont regret it!
B00005YW4H|5.0|I've read a couple of the reviews in Amazon about this cd. I ordered it anyway. I just can't believe how some people react to this absolutely beautiful cd. I have not enjoyed an entire piece of work like this for a very long time. I heard \\"Don't know why\\" on the radio and for those precious minutes while that song played I felt so relaxed and soothed. I loved her voice and the song. So I looked it up and ordered it. <BR>All of the songs on this cd have that same soothing effect that is so welcome in this sometimes hard world. <BR>\\"I've got to see you again\\" is another favorite on this cd full of favorites. It is so mellow and so beautifully orchestrated.<BR>This is a great cd for travelling down the road. It is a great cd for listening to on your home stereo.<BR>Since I bought it, I have listened to it over and over and I highly recommend it to anyone who likes new artists and likes soulful, soothing music to unwind after a hard days work. I also recommend it to guys out there who are enjoying a romantic evening with their beautiful lady and would like to put something on to enhance the atmosphere. Sparks could fly.
B00004T9AS|3.0|\\"EARTH MOVING\\" is a total suprise.No instrumental pieces.Only songs.But If you thought that this is a bad album or not Oldfield styled i must dissagree.Mike is representing quite high level of performing and composing, even here.And everywhere you can hear his characteristic Guitar.<BR>There are many guests here like Adrian Belew(King Crimson lead vocalist and guitarist), Max Bacon (From GTR) and Maggie reilly (Most well known Oldfield's voice).OF course, their Voices not always the raise quality of these songs.<BR>\\"INNOCENT\\" is the worst track from This cd, Propably one of Mike's most Lowest in eighties.very Boring disco Synthesisers and Anita's Hergland (Oldfield's Wife during eighties) make this tune very similar to Rick Astley's or early Madonna tracks.Just Dreadfull,Skip it.\\"SEE THE LIGHT\\" is a remain of famous \\"Shadow on the wall\\"(a hard rock song with some exciting reefs from album \\"Crises).\\"SEE THE LIGHT\\" is sadly very poor and Boring when compared to \\"Shadow...\\".All the strengt had all vanished somewhere.\\"BLUE NIGHT\\" (echo of \\"Moonlight shadwow\\"),\\"RUNAWAY SON\\" and \\"FAR COUNTRY\\"(nice guitar solo)are very foresight and normal.dissapointing.<BR>The other half of album is more interesting.Title track is a modern pop-Soul piece, very satisfing and catchy.Mike has done a good job here.\\"Hostage\\" is dramatic and energetic rock song with bacon's good vocals (if you like his voice).And Finaly \\"Nothing but/bridge to paradise\\" - the longest track.It starts with a peacefull Soul ballad and later getting into fast electro-pop tune.Nice and catchy,worth of listening.<BR>Well, First i wanted to rate this Two Stars but....When i'm listening it from beginning to the end i really enjoy it (except \\"Innocent\\"...) But when i compare it to \\"Tubular Bells\\" or \\"Five Miles out\\" i can see how poor this is. So in the end i rate this as a normal album, not comparing it to anything.<BR>But still,if you like Oldfield for his long suits, buy something else...
B000089CKH|4.0|Nada Surf is a recent signee of our friends at Barsuk Records (of Death Cab For Cutie fame).  They actually had a hit back in 1995 or 6 called \\"Popular\\", it sort of had a grungy chorus, and had a whiny California-voiced kid rap-talking about cliques and sounding a little like King Missile's \\"Detachable Penis\\".  I vaguely remember hating it at the time, and a recent seek-out seemed to validate my initial opinion.  Well, in the interim, they kind of \\"recovered\\" from that fluke hit, and unlike other one-hit bands actually stuck it out and stuck together, playing the clubs, gaining some cred and developing some good songwriting skills. They also scored some good-to-know friends. \\"Let Go\\" is their Barsuk debut, and it is co-produced by DCFC's Ben Gibbard.  His touch is evident, from the acoustic breaks to the extended atmospheric jams at the ends of certain tracks.   But unlike Death Cab, they seem entirely willing to skip over the pop line at crucial times, and are more immediately accessible.  Plus a penchant for finding harmonically exquisite choruses makes them radio-ready.  They played a great version of Inside Of Love on Conan recently.  A great album, and Nada Surf earns a one to watch award - strange yet true for a band trying to put their MTV hit-days behind them.
B000000WG4|5.0|Perfect,Masterfull,Great,Wonderfull,Impressive......These words Can not describe the power of this music.Mike in the age of 18 has done the album that most of people after 40 can't make.All  instruments are played proffesional.Nothing is missing here.Powerfull bass riff in the Finale of first part,Grand piano,Mike's \\"Caveman\\" vocals and melancholic spanish guitar are only small elements in this colorfull voyage.Just turn it up...loud!!!!!
B00005JLEU|5.0|When this movie was released i said i could wait until it came out on video. But, i wish i had never said that. this movie was really well done, and deserved it's Oscar. <br />The movie starts out with a young girl and her family in a car going to their new house, when they come across a large house with  a tunnel. her and her mother and father decide to look inside. When they reach the end they discover an abandoned amusement park. They travel around and find food. The girls' parents decide to dig in but she refuses. She explores somemore and discovers an enormous bath house. the girl bumps into a boy and he warns her to get away from the park as fast as she can before dark. but, it's to late. when she runs back to find her parents they have been transformed into PIGS! She soon dicovers she is trapped in this old amuesment park. Not knowing what to do without her parents a boy helps her,a nd tells her to get a job in order to stay at the park and save her parents. she visits some intresting characters in order to get a job like a 6 handed boiler man. she gets a job at the bath house and meets some strange people. this movie was very good and it keeps getting better and better as the film goes on. this is truely a disney classic!If you like Spirited awaY you'll also like Kiki's Delivery Service.
B000000I0D|3.0|About two weeks ago i listened once again to \\"Crises\\" and i found it not as bad as after buying...i have rediscovered it as a CD with some really great moments,the title track simply growes ojn you after many listenings...<BR>ok, here are my impressions about all tracks...<br />1)\\"CRISES\\" - about 21 minutes long suite. Starts with a soft theme played by a synth and tubular bells.<BR>after it we have a two small guitar based themes.the second one has even a loops of car engine sound and ambulance...<BR>Later it grows in more and more energetic and full of agressive guitars title song (Mike sings as a main vocalist in this suite).<BR>The title song is an angry anthem, where mike roars \\"Crises, crises!!! you can't get away...\\". it is a really great moment of this album.Guitar work is impressive...<BR>Later on the atmosphere changes with \\"The watcher and the tower\\" song. It is a gentle and pathetic track with wonderfull vocals and beautifull guitar...the drums are rythmic and are a solid back-up for a melody...<BR>\\"watcher and the tower\\" fades into a quiet variation of beginning theme...This is the most beautifull moment from here,and worth af buying whole album...Gentle synth and bass and a fantastic guitar solo...<BR>Then the coda of \\"Crises\\" beggins...Coda is a synth variation of one of the themes from here...And this is where the suite gets boring.The loud and almost 8 minutes long ending is repetative and irritating...Even the \\"ommadawn\\" styled ending (tribal srums and female vocals) are not makling it better...<BR>and so this suite should end after 12 minutes, not after 20...<BR> 3,5/4<br />2)\\"Moonlight shadow\\" - the most well-known and biggest hit ever of Mike Oldfield. I think that every person in the world heard it at least one time in lifetime...It's a nice acoutic guitar based track, with sweet vocals by Maggie reilly...sounds a bit like Fleetwod Mac songs.The guitar solo is the best one that Mike ever played.listen to this solo and you will know why he is such a genius.<BR> 5/5<br />3)\\"In high places\\" - A great colaboration with Jon Anderson (Yes singer). simple but very catchy song about flying.extremly cool melody. Synths and Vibraphone parts are remarkable.wonderfull.<BR> 5/5<br />4)\\"Forreign affair\\" - another hit single. monnotonic song based on one repetative chorus.Could be a Typical eighties pop but Mike made it kind of Mantra song...very hypnotising track...but although it is interesting it is a little bit boring.<BR> 4/5<br />5) \\"Taurus III\\" - third part of Taurus trilogy.A flamenco styled song but nothing special.Classical guitars are very irritating.it is a filler.just skip it <BR> 2/5<br />6.\\"Shadow one the wall\\" - Energetic Rocker...memorable vocals by Roger Chapman...the most energetic song from here.i love almost everything about it.from the bass line to hidden banjo...<BR>sadly the version that is here is the edit of original track that appears on \\"Elements\\" and \\"the complete\\" compilations...get the longer and original version!!!!!<BR> 3,75/5<br />In the end- this album is maybe not hte worster Mike 's album, but it is not his best either...there are brilliant moments on here and whole album is a classic but beside \\"Earth moving\\" it is the weakest eighties Cd of Oldfield...go and buy \\"QE2\\" of \\"five Miles out\\"!!! well, you can check \\"crises\\" too but do not expect his genius at full on here...
B000069CWE|5.0|I'm kinda confused by this review:<br />&quot;You people think this is metal? You are all so blinded by corporate media that you will take anything that's thrown at you as long as it's labeled cool. Get a life. Speak your own mind. Listen to some Iced Earth, that's metal right there. So I am giving you the fair warning; don't buy this cd. You will regret it. Instead buy some Megadeth or Pantera, they destroy Linkin Puke.&quot;<br />I Say:<br />No...I don't think this is &quot;metal&quot; and that's why I like it? Why do you think only metalheads listen to LP? If anything this is a more HipHop oriented album than a &quot;metal&quot; oriented album. You have some of the best underground HipHop artist represented such as Aceyalone, Pharoache Monch, J5, Dilated People, and Cali Agents. Maybe you should try to expand your horizons....I listen to The Ministry, Megadeth, Pantera..Cowboys From Hell is a great album...but I'm also down for some Dilated People, J5 and Freestyle Fellowship. Just because they don't fit into the genre of music you call &quot;Metal&quot; doesn't mean it isn't good music.
B000065V9Y|4.0|it's A very sensual Album.Dont expect real hits here.Lyrics are mostly about Peter's demons (it came shortly after he divorced with his wife) and personal problems.Although the opening song \\"COME TALK TO ME\\" is quite cheerfull, \\"BLOOD OF EDEN\\" and \\"LOVE TO BE LOVED\\" are really sad and simply touching.Even a single hit \\"DIGGING IN THE DIRT\\" is introspective and creepy (just listen when Gabriel shouts \\"This time it's gone to far...i told you, i told you!!!\\").The Culmination of his Fears is indescribable Dark and scary \\"Only us\\".A majestic Bass line and quasi-trival atmosphere are simply wonderfull.But the ending leaves hope for future (\\"Secret world\\").<BR>The only track i don't like is \\"KISS THAT FROG\\".It is just not fitting here and is a bit to much popish and joyfull.i am listening to \\"US\\" since 1998 but i never really enjoyed this tune.<BR>But all the rest is great.Just another piece of wonderfull music from wonderfull artist
B00005YXZH|1.0|After reading several 5-star reviews of this CD, I was compelled to go out and buy it.  Unfortunately, I don't get it.  What I'm hearing after several listens is an overt attempt at being &quot;artsy&quot;.  Jeff Tweedy's songs are buried in meaningless moments of white noise and attempts at &quot;atmosphere&quot; which seem to have no rhyme or reason.  It seems that if the band had taken as much time thinking about arrangements as they did with sonic experiments, there might have been something to sink your teeth into.  As it is, I feel that this CD would be a waste of money for someone interested in a memorable melody or anything resembling competent musicianship.  There's none here.  They didn't even bother to play in time with one another on some tracks, although I suspect that's just another attempt at being clever.  As for Tweedy's vocals or lyrics, not much substance to latch onto.  Even if you've liked Wilco's other productions, skip this or use it for a coaster.  That's about all it deserves.
B00005JL7Q|4.0|This movie has been pegged as a romantic comedy, but it's actually more of a comedy/drama.  While there is romance, that does not come until later in the film and there's so much more to this film than that.  After seeing as much as I could stand of Bridget Jones' Diary, and hearing that the same writer wrote the story that this film was based on, I was skeptical even though Hugh Grant was in it.  I like Hugh Grant.  I think his comedic timing is fantastic, he rates very high on the charm scale, he's not bad to look at, and that accent is to die for.  HOWEVER, Bridget Jones' Diary appeared to be a mistake for Mr. Grant in my eyes.  Alas, curiosity won over, I couldn't resist, and I watched About A Boy anyway.  I was pleasantly surprised!  This movie was full of humor, intelligent humor as well as below the belt humor. Hugh was a pleasure to watch in this film that seemed to be tailored to him, for what we know of the real life Grant. Grant plays a shallow, womanizing, self-proclaimed forever bachelor who has no interest in children.  Enter a boy.  Enter a troubled boy from a troubled home who has a bit of social trouble at school. Grant, being nothing if not rich and suave, winds up helping this boy that he initially wanted nothing to do with.  Along the way, he does find romance and he finds himself -- a new and improved self.  He also manages to make a difference in the lives of the other lead characters.  All in all, this one is definitely worth a watch if not an own.  If you're a fan of Grant's charm and humor in movies like Nine Months and Notting Hill, you won't be disappointed.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|When I saw this one film advertised on television around the time of its theatrical release, I just saw it as an annoying and extremely overrated little kids animation with bad dialogue. Yes, the film was Shrek. Everyone was going crazy for it, and I criticised it for months. I finally caught onto the film when I reluctantly borrowed the DVD from one of my friends. My opinions totally changed. This film is hilarious! Easily the best animated film of 2001, Shrek dominated the box office worldwide, raking in almost $500 million and making almost the same amount in video and DVD sales in its first eight weeks on release. The film is simply remarkable, and boasts a fantastic script, beautiful animation, extremely humorous dialogue and some great twists. With all this secured, it is a film that is sure to appeal to people of all ages.<br /><br />Shrek (Mike Myers) is a big green ogre, who is loathed by many other creatures who live around him. They see him as fat, ugly and clumsy. Because of this, he lives a lonely and miserable life. One day things take a turn for the worse when the heartless Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow) decides upon evicting all the fairytale characters of his land from their homes. They all begin to squat on Shrek's swamp - and he's furious. Along with an outrageous and hilarious talking donkey (Eddie Murphy) who has squeezed in with the other squatters, Shrek decides to pay a visit to Lord Farquaad demanding answers and a reasonable conclusion for the squatters incident. By the time their meeting has finished with Lord Farquaad at his castle, Shrek and the donkey have been selected to rescue Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) from a dragon's lair and bring her back safely so Lord Farquaad can marry her. If the mission is a success, Shrek will be free to rule his swamp without any squatters.<br /><br />And so Shrek and the donkey set off on their mission. The action begins, along with the humour. The two argue all the time, but make a great comedy-duo. Mike Myers fills his role as Shrek with a determined effort that shines throughout the entire film, and makes you feel a range of emotions for the giant but gentle ogre. The compassion he emits in his voice for Shrek is wonderful. Eddie Murphy is equally successful in providing a simply triumphant voice for the donkey. Personality wise, the two have a lot in common; they're both brash, hilarious, outrageous and loud. And while the donkey is not the central part of the storyline, he definitely provides the most laughs and has some classic scenes. Witness his horror as the female dragon gently tries to seduce him, batting her eyelids as he just goes along with it all to save his own skin as he complements her on her dental hygiene! Cameron Diaz has perhaps the most difficult voice to play in Shrek. She doesn't have a character who is outspoken or permenantly angry to make the character memorable. Princess Fiona is a brilliant character, but Diaz is the dull link in a chain of excellent and radiant aspects of this film. Disney's past few films have all been badly produced and general flops at box offices. DreamWorks takes advantage of Disney's recent slump, showing them how brilliant child's comedy films should be made. Overall, this is a fabulous film that appeals to all ages, has a witty and charming conclusion, and is destined to become a future classic. A film that is definitely worthy of a sequel, Shrek is a winner on all accounts!s role as Shrek with a determined effort that shines throughout the entire film, and makes you feel a range of emotions for the giant but gentle ogre.

078322687X|5.0|Probably one of the best teen flicks of the 1980s, The Breakfast club released in 1985, is good. It speaks to High Schoolers everywhere and giving the hardships many face in High School and how we catergorize ourselves.  Every single actor in this movie plays there parts well, I especially like Ally Sheedy's character because I associat the most with her.  This movie speaks about kids in High School of all generations. This movie will live on forever. I recommend this movie fully because it speaks about my generation, Generation 80s, and no one can ever take that away from me.
B00008I8IF|4.0|this is a great album which thankfully harks back to the traditional Jayhawks and skips over the electro-country of Smile.<br />The title says it all. Don't expect an album packed with high octane rock n'rollers. Most of the tracks display the same restrained melody and performance of the quieter moments of The Sound of Lies, cleanly produced and largely acoustic with electric adding a nuance here and there. The dual male harmonies are still evident and bring back memories of the sound of the original Jayhawks.<br />A couple of the songs are not particularly distinctive and the overtly 60s sound of Madman sits out of place but sit down in the right frame of mind and this album will satisfy your appetite. From the superb opening track penned with Matthew Sweet thru The Eyes of Sarahjane, the perky Angelyne, from Tampa to Tulsa , Rainy Day Music should accompany your dark and cloudy moments perfectly.
B00000IPAX|4.0|This cd suffers greatly through the absence of original drummer Scott Raynor. Travises style of drumming totally doesnt suit blink's way of playing and makes them sound extremly poppy.<BR>Although Mutt and Anthem were written in the orginal line up, the other songs make it way to different sounding.
B00003BDXG|5.0|People often refer this powerful film, especially the critics who are the media as a grisly mish-mash of pure amateurish style directing. I think that people really did not see the true nature of the film. That is the media controls our thoughts, feelings and behavior. We as the American culture do not scratch the surface of things and only accept things as face value. If we ask questions or refuse to go along with the status quo we are automatically labeled a \\"Terrorist, Insane, UnAmerican, and deviant\\". Ask yourself what you believe now and then and you will begin to be truly free. TURN OFF THAT T.V.!

0060920084|1.0|It is clear half way through this thing that the author hates, among so many other things, strip malls, fast food chains, cheap motels, tourist traps and old people.  Yet he drives endlessly through America searching them out - on a good day, endlessly complaining and on a bad day - making fun of them.  What starts out as a mission of discovery turns into a mission of ridicule.  The beauty of America lies in its diversity.  Yet if you if you were from another planet and read this travelogue first, you wouldn't even stop in for a cup of coffee.  And that's really too bad.
0375704027|5.0|What a book. My advice is to start early in the day, and preferably not on a work night. The book just can't be put down; I read it in one sitting! Murakami is a gifted story teller, even now I feel like I read it just yesterday. Like the other reviewers I am sure I will revisit this again in the future.
B00008PW3Q|4.0|This album certainly compares favorably to the other albums FM has released during the Buckingham era.

B00006CXSS|5.0|Not all of my elderly, veteran friends are around to appreciate this miniseries (including a father), but the few left to represent the others have given their enthusiastic approval. \\"We Were Soldiers\\" tried to \\"get it right\\" about Vietnam in a way \\"Band of Brothers\\" seems to \\"get it right\\" about World War II. To quote \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" there was plenty of army bureaucracy \\"F.U.B.A.R.\\" to go around, but then there was the camaraderie among the soldiers themselves to counterbalance everything. I got your back and you have my back is an experience where race, religion, politics and other differences melt away. The foxhole religion is to pray to any god that will listen as desperately as possible. If your buddy is Catholic and has his rosary out, you simply grab lower on the chain of beads and follow his lead. It is the FORMAT of how the European experience of World War II is presented that is so impressive, starting with the interview with actual veterans before each episode. Each episode focuses on one young actor and solidier's story at a time. I sincerely hope there is a sequel about the Pacific Theatre of war. I would especially like to see this done about the Navaho Codetalkers, as \\"Windtalkers\\" simply did not do justice to this rich story. Hopefully, this can be done while there are still veteran Codetalkers alive to be interviewed.
B00005YW4H|5.0|I understand how this album can receive a ton of criticism, it's different to hear a jazz vocalist/soul singer when rap music, pop, and nu-metal are in our young listeners' ears, this is a good album, I like it a lot, I'm not sure if it deserved all the Grammies it earned but for &quot;Album of the Year&quot; it was deserved, Nelly, Bruce Springsteen don't have a sassy sound like Ms. Jones does.  It's not a bad debut but I've heard better, also remember that most bands achieve their original and mature sound way after their debut album.  The Red Hot Chili Peppers didn't get their mature sound until 5 albums, it took Dave Matthews Band 2 albums, Pearl Jam still is maturing and changing, and Soundgarden took at least 7 years.  What really matters is, guys, back off, it's not that bad, you just have to be more open..
6303965415|3.0|PERSUASION is another in a series of film adaptations of Jane Austen novels that take place in the Regency England of the early 1800s, a world where landed gentleman bemoan the fact that they haven't sired sons to inherit the estate, and whose unmarried daughters moon about waiting for well-mannered, moneyed Hunks to come within striking distance.<br />The lovelorn protagonist in this particular story is Anne Elliot (Amanda Root), the middle daughter of Walter (Corin Redgrave). Anne's mother being dead, the dominant female of Elliot's Kellynch Estate is Elizabeth (Phoebe Nicholls), Anne's older sister, who is becoming a sour and malicious Old Maid. However, Walter is financially strapped and must move the household to Bath, while renting out the Big House to Admiral Croft, since returned to land after the end of the latest squabble with France. While Walter and Elizabeth carriage off to their new digs, Anne visits with her younger sister, the selfish and silly Mary (Sophie Thompson), who's married to the son of another country gentleman, Mr. Musgrove, who himself has two unmarried daughters waiting for Prince Charming. As it so happens, Mrs. Croft (Fiona Shaw) has a brother, Frederick Wentworth (Ciaran Hinds), also in the Royal Navy. Eight years previous, Wentworth, then a junior officer with no financial prospects, and 19-year old Anne had a secret infatuation that ended when the latter reluctantly rejected the former's marriage proposal on the advice of a meddling socialite, Lady Russell (Susan Fleetwood). Wentworth, now holding the rank of Captain and possessing considerable means from the prize ships his command captured in the latest war, is back in town. Will his love affair with Anne be resurrected, or will he be snared by one of the Musgrove sisters? In the meantime, Anne is taking hits from William Elliot, her handsome cousin and heir apparent to Kellynch Estate.<br />Whew! Have you got all of this written down?<br />PERSUASION is impeccably acted, costumed and photographed, and, as such, should rightfully be ranked as one of the best of Austen's Big Screen soaps. In my opinion, however, it's flawed as an entertainment vehicle when compared with the recent cinematic versions of EMMA, PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, SENSE AND SENSIBILITY, and MANSFIELD PARK. Anne failed to inspire in this viewer the admiration and affection engendered by the heroines of those others, who were individually more clever, more intelligent, more plucky, or more vivacious. Of single women in her position, Anne states, &quot;We live at home - quiet, confined - and our feelings prey upon us.&quot; Stewing in one's own juice is more like it, and Anne raises this exercise to an art form. Jeez, go out and get a job at Starbuck's already! And, while none of the JA epics are action thrillers by the wildest imagination, PERSUASION moves at a pace akin to rock formation.<br />Perhaps the most interesting character is Mrs. Croft. At this point in history (1814), the Admiralty apparently had a policy of allowing its warship commanders to take their spouses along on deployments. Thus, the Admiral's wife has seen much of the world, much to the envy of the stay-at-home-and-be-wretched ladies. Unfortunately, Mrs. Croft has too little screen time and makes no effort to impart any wider perspective to sad sack Anne.<br />I enjoyed PERSUASION to a certain degree for no other reason than it's an excellent period piece, but am thankful that it's the last of the Austen flicks that I'd obligated myself to see.and photographed, and, as such, should rightfully be ranked as one of the best of Austen's Big Screen soaps.

B00008PW3O|5.0|Say You Will, the new CD by Fleetwood Mac, isn't going to hook you with one particular song with a catchy rhythm. Instead every single song on the lengthy CD will please you with subtle sophistication. <br />There isn't a bad song among the 18 on the CD. But there are many standouts. Say You Will is probably has the most \\"hit\\" potential, while Peacekeeper seems appropriate in this time of war. I interpret Peacekeeper as a decidedly anti-war song and I love it for that reason and because it's a beautiful song. <br />Stevie has many standout songs. Illume for it's timeliness--being a song about 9-11. But Stevie's songs on this CD are noteworthy because it is her voice that is front and center and not hidden by heavy music. Thrown Down is an anthem for those looking for love even when love is right there with you. <br />There are a few rockers in the bunch...Lindsey's Come and Stevie's Running Through The Garden & Everybody Finds Out are all fine examples of what these mature artists can do. <br />On Stevie's Everybody Finds Out, Fleetwood Mac shows how it can grow and change because this song has the most interesting instrumental arrangement of any FM song...ever.<br />Lindsey's Bleed To Love Her is a truly awesome love song.<br />Probably the most incredible song on the entire CD is Stevie's Goodbye Baby. I interpret this song as a lullaby for aborted babies. This song brought tears to my eyes. <br />This is an awesome collection of music and a true tribute to the staying power of an awesome group of musicians. There are two elements missing, however. Christine McVie and a Stevie/Lindsey duet.<br />I don't believe this CD could be any better than it is.  It's truly awesome.
B00005ATQ9|4.0|I just revisited Stanley Kubrick's Barry Lyndon several years after my first viewing. I can remember not enjoying it so well the first time around, however, the second time I really did like it. It really doesn't feel like a three-hour film. When I first saw it, around the age of 18 or so, I was expecting something closer to the Kubrick films that I knew and loved like 2001, A Clockwork Orange and The Shining. I did not expect a rather straight-forward period costume epic. I thought there would be something out of the ordinary about it. Some bizarre characters, wicked twists, graphic violence, dreamlike scenes. Yet Barry Lyndon contains none of this. <br />It's an epic drama about the rise and fall of an Irish rogue in the late 18th century. Lavishly photographed, using only natural light, real costumes, good acting (with possible exception of Ryan O'Neal), but somehow lacking the Kubrick feel. It's a pretty conventional film. There's nothing really outlandish about it. However, being written (based on a 19th century novel), produced and directed by the man, it is undeniably a Stanley Kubrick film and deserves attention as such. Perhaps the most Kubrickian (if I may use the term) thing about Barry Lyndon is how un-Kubrick-like it is. Audiences had come to expect the unexpected from Kubrick, and what would be more unpredictable than to follow-up a film like A Clockwork Orange with a costume epic set in the 18th century? That's the way he was. Always taking the divergent path. <br />Now, regarding the film itself, it's very well made, not surprising considering its creator. The story of Redmond Barry is interesting, particularly in its historical context. Several wonderful scenes alone make the film worth watching. A small battle scene during the Seven Years War, the card-playing scenes, and the duel between Barry and his stepson near the end. There are some sporadic scenes with dazzling camera work and Kubrick manages to sneak in a couple of his tracking shots. The film is leisurely paced, as nearly all Kubrick films, but interest is always maintained. <br />I don't think that anyone would claim Barry Lyndon Kubrick's greatest achievement, but it is a remarkable achievement nonetheless. Perhaps more accessible to mainstream audiences than his typical work, Barry Lyndon is definitely an enjoyable experience for fans of Kubrick, but perhaps more so for fans of lavish costume epics. So enjoy it for what it is, just don't expect any of the old ultraviolence.
B00005JLSE|5.0|This is an amazing movie!!!  This amazing revival with Richard Gere, Catherine Zeta-Jones, and Renee Zellweger is just amazing, with original Bob Fosse dancing. For all of you [people] don't know, Rob Marshall (who directed and choreographed it) used ALL of the original Bob Fosse dancing. [...]And did i mention how well Gere handled his character? He tends to play very serious roles, but he lets his silly side show through. Chicago is a star-maker for Zellweger, and Zeta- Jones again shines through. I seriously reccomend this for any serious broadway buff!!
B00006HBUC|5.0|This movie was done very well.  It matches the characters of the Cartoon perfectly.  Very funny and entertaining.  I was a bit skeptical when I first picked it up but after watching it, I really enjoyed how the charactors we so accurate in relationship to the cartoon.  My children and I have watched this move at least 10 times and it is always funny.
B00005B36H|5.0|If there is one rock band that is in a league of its own these days, with its own unique sound and unparalleled lyrical content, its Tool. Tool fans waited 5 years for this LP to drop, seeing as their last major (and hit) release was 1996 with &quot;Aenima&quot;. And I can say clearly and definitively - it was worth the wait.<br />Tool's basic sound remains the same throughout the years, but each album has had a totally different sound and overall melody to it. Their debut disc, Opiate, was filled with much shorter, more lyrically filled songs, than what we know as Tool today. Undertow came with a harder side; a more intense and unpredictable sound to it. Aenima hit us with the most lyrically filled, yet most harmonic, Tool album to date. And now, Lateralus. Lateralus is on a level of its own. We get some hard stuff, we get some soft stuff, and we get the in-between. It's definitely a more matured sound for the band. The songs seem to be more obscure on their meaning then past releases as well - keeps even the hardest of Tool fans thinking and questioning true meanings to the songs. It's really an unreal experience delving into the lyrics of Tool and Maynard and trying to pick them apart.<br />The CD starts off with a very hard track, &quot;The Grudge&quot;, which also introduces us to the average length of tracks on the CD - roughly 6 and a half minutes. Following is a great interlude called &quot;Eon Blue Apocalypse&quot;, and after that is another hit track, &quot;The Patient&quot;. The main single and the song that all non-Tool fans can even recognize, &quot;Schism&quot;, is a very different sound and seems to throw the CD in a different direction... That is, until you hit the Parabol/Parabola combo. Some of the best tracks on the CD are in this section - Parabola, Ticks And Leeches, and Lateralus, are all pretty hard but so flawless. Following these classic tracks are even... more classic tracks! What Tool fans commonly refer to as the trilogy/triad of tracks, these next few introduce us to a rare side of the band and one that we possibly may see more of in the next album. Disposition starts it off with a very slow harmonic tone, not much lyrics, and a soft appeal. This leads into Reflection which is the longest song on the CD, weighing in at 15 minutes. Following in the same fashion, track 12 &quot;Triad&quot; has a little bit of middle-eastern appeal to it and leads us into the final track which is a very strange &quot;Faaip De Oiad&quot;.<br />This album is a must have for anyone. Whether you appreciate good rock music, or want to try a taste of something new and unique, Lateralus will deliver in all aspects. It flows together so nicely and every song is near flawless. I don't have a favorite Tool CD (I like the latter 3 equally), but I can easily say this is Tool's most professional sounding work. Very mature and solid.<br />Pick it up.<br />9.8 / 10these next few introduce us to a rare side of the band and one that we possibly may see more of in the next album.

B00008DDXC|5.0|This will be a great an enjoyable movie, especially if you enjoyed the previous Harry Potter DVD.
B00008PW3Q|5.0|When I bought this CD I honestly expected to get three or four good songs and a bunch of middling softrock/filler.  It was on sale so I thought \\"why not?\\"<br />I am completely stunned at how good this CD is and how much I like it! There is so much energy in this music.  Without question, this is the best Fleetwood Mac release since Rumours.<br />Mick and John pound, thump, and pulse with authority through the whole album and provide the backbone for everything. Lindsey's production is extremely tight, he employs his entire range of guitar-work, and his solos are pyrotechnic.  Stevie's voice is in wonderful shape, vibratto and all.  She employs much more melody than she's used in recent years and to tremendous effect.<br />The real star of the show, though, is the songwriting and the way the band sounds like a unit.  Some of the songs are still growing on me, but the only one I doubt I'll warm to is \\"Red Rover.\\"  This is a perfect pop-rock album: it has softer stuff (but never gets drippy) and it has edginess (without taking itself too seriously).  If you like Fleetwood Mac, absolutely buy this!
B000002J1S|4.0|In light of what has been said about this CD by so many other reviewers, I shall keep my comments brief.  This CD is the disjointed tale of a street punk named Rael, who is suddenly pulled into a surreal nightmare world.  The title song contains an obvious reference to \\"On Broadway\\".  \\"Fly On A Windshield\\" is good up until its key change.  Peter Gabriel's voice sounds like it's been distorted through a Leslie speaker on \\"Cuckoo Cocoon\\".  \\"In The Cage\\" starts the real madness off.  \\"The Grand Parade\\" is a pseudo-glamorous death sell.  \\"Counting Out Time\\" is the most comical number here.  \\"The Carpet Crawlers\\" and \\"The Chamber Of 32 Doors\\" sound like a Catholic nightmare.  \\"Lilywhite Lillith\\" is Rael's way out, but right into \\"The Waiting Room\\".    \\"Anyway\\" is the lamentable wait for death, which appears as \\"The Supernatural Anesthetist\\".  \\"The Lamiae\\" is the prettiest song here.    \\"Silent Sorrow In Empty Boats\\" reminds me of Joe Zawinul's \\"In A Silent Way\\" and the slow movement of the Barber Violin Concerto.  The horrific \\"Colony Of Slippermen\\" leaves one breathless. \\"The Light Dies Down\\" should end the concept, but \\"it\\" serves as a suitable coda.  Rolling Stones fans take note of this final song!
B000069AUI|2.0|I sat and listened to this material and tried I mean really tried to figure out what is wrong with this lp? And from a musicians stand point, these guys really lack in chord progression. I mean they Bang on the same chords repeatedly throughout the whole entire lp with the exception of a few tracks. I am trying to figure out why is there is a band in the first place? Step Up ! And play some new chords, that is why you are a band I thought? I mean goodness it almost seems like they are sitting back there scared biting there nails saying \\"Are we Up next?\\" I mean if I had a mental picture of this? I would say they are standing back there looking at one another. Waiting on the vocalist to snap his fingers after he is finished with his verses. \\"Challenge the lead vocalist, give him something to work for!\\" His song writing isn't  that complex for the band to be buried in the background. I mean if you were to put some real players behind him I don't think he could keep up! Oh, well they got enough fans and they have made enough money someone's got a great Facade! The sales on this album are big enough to where I believe now they can afford to take a few lessons. I mean, in all honesty to keep Bangin on the same chords doesn't say alot for the musicianship. And is definitley is a bit more than I can take coming from a mainstream band ! Oh well, Maybe the \\"Sneaker Pimps\\" can give them a lesson or two. If you really want to hear some real chord progression and talent download a few cuts off of \\"Sneaker Pimps (Splinter)\\". I recommend these tracks, \\"Half life, Ten to Twenty, Superbug and Flowers & Silence\\". And I think you to will agree that this band is extremely limited in there abilities. I guess this is O.K for the untrained ear they obviously have done a good job at fooling people. There on there second lp and still going strong so more power too them, if people haven't figured it out. But in my opinion, I believe the name of the band speaks for it self! I would have to say \\"Trouble and Clocks\\" are \\"Coldplay\\" at there best! But as far as  \\"A rush of Blood\\" as a entirety ? let me just say this ! I think when they are not on the road they may want to spend some time together and get to know each other abit better. Because right now it sounds like the vocalist is laying his vocals at 5 O'clock and the band is laying the music at 6....<br />The effort is mediocure at best!<br />Arish
B0000024LN|5.0|...'cuz Redman keeps the circuits overworked (from &quot;Whateva Man&quot;).<br />Redman - Muddy Waters (Def Jam, 1996)<br />Though I listened to Redman ever since EPMD's &quot;Headbanger&quot; (where he was introduced to the world), this is the first album I bought from him. I recently dug this album out, listened to it again and it still sounds great. This album contains Redman's best lyrics and Erick Sermon's best beats, and truthfully, this is the last album that either one of them would sound THIS good. As any Redman fan will know, finding the best lyric is a hard task because every lyric on this album is tight. Even Jamal (now known as Mally G.) raps well on &quot;Da Ill Out&quot;. This is also the last album where those pesky WDEF radio skits would be entertaining and worth rewinding. If you're only used to the &quot;I'll Bee Dat&quot;-type Redman (which is not a bad thing), then I advise you to pick this album up and keep your finger next to the rewind button at all times. -EJR
B00006V9A0|5.0|This Cd is excellent..as is all Nirvana. However, for those of us who are old enough to remember that Teen Spirit was a popular deoderant name back in those days...it lacks a lot of songs which although not as popular still are essential Nirvana. I would have liked to have seen more tracks on this CD.
6305728437|5.0|Simply put, this is one of the best movies ever made, animated or unanimated, Disney or otherwise.<br />The characters are perfect.  Every character has a distinct, memorable personality, and the Mulan-Mushu-Crickee combination was just perfect. <br />The plot is excellent.  The storyline was detailed and memorable.  <br />The sound and music are beautifully done.  A few reviews said that the music was only average, I have no idea why.  The tunes from this movie were stuck in my head for weeks (not a bad thing)<br />The animation is excellent.  Just watch the battle where the Huns charge down the slope.  Possibly the best looking scene from any animated movie.<br />Forget the notion that disney movies are for kids.  I'm 17 years old, I loved this movie, and a lot of my friends that are about the same age loved it too.  (Some scenes in this movie might actually not be for kids, like the scenes with the Huns, and the somewhat violent battles.)
B00008PW3Q|4.0|And so here we are, in 2003, with a new Fleetwood Mac album, containing 80% of the &quot;classic&quot; line-up from the mid-70's to mid-80's. Can the Mac be relevant in a music world, increasingly dominated by either manufactured, TV generation pop or down and dirty hip-hop? Or are they yet another band on the increasingly lucrative reunion bandwagon, rolling out all of the old hits to an aging audience? They don't really fit into either category and perhaps that's why they have always transcended music fashion from the sixties to the noughties. That doesn't always mean they have made great music, but the music they have made is always unique.<br />On this latest album, &quot;Say You Will&quot;, they have reinvented themselves once again to a degree, this time with the welcome return of lead guitarist and pop genius Lindsey Buckingham. His influence is the biggest on this album, the most since the ragged masterpeice, &quot;Tusk&quot;, and he lets go on a couple of masterpieces. On &quot;Murrow Turning Over In His Grave&quot;, we hear the ghost of &quot;I'm So Afraid&quot; intertwined with Moby of all people. And on &quot;Come&quot;, he unleashes his blistering guitar to devastating effect - he may have said goodbye to 50 but that doesn't mean he is going to churn out elevator music. However that doesn't mean the timeless rock goddess, Stevie Nicks is completely in the shadows. She and Buckingham share nine songs each on this album and her contributions are nothing to sneer at, continuing her resurgence which began with her last solo album &quot;Trouble in Shangri-La&quot;. Of particular note is &quot;Thrown Down&quot; with its infectiously catchy hook in the chorus and &quot;Running Through The Garden&quot; which rivals &quot;I Can't Wait&quot; and &quot;Whole Lotta Trouble&quot; in lite-rock status. The Mac also still produce great hit singles, with the lead-off &quot;Peacekeeper&quot; and the title track easily fitting into the pantheon on adult-pop hits they have become famous for. There is a sheer joy in hearing Nicks and Buckingham's vocals in glorious harmony, while one of the world's longest lived music marriages, John McVie and Mick Fleetwood provide their able support in the rhythmn section.<br />However, despite what the band might say about a new direction, they clearly miss Christine McVie's contribution. Her ghost does waft through the background vocals of the Lindsey-ballad &quot;Bleed To Love Her&quot; and one can only speculate what contribution her elegant lilt and pop savvy might have added to this album. Nevertheless the Mac have continued and if there is any justice, this should earn the band new-found respect and popularity from music-lovers the world over.become famous for.

B000069AUI|2.0|Yeah, I think I would have to agree with the other reviewer! You should give \\"Splinter\\" by the \\"Sneaker Pimps\\" a listen if you like this. They have the same empathetic sound but they do it with more finesse, creativity and dignity than this band. This band does lack alot of chord progression and craftmanship !
B00000294R|3.0|Big L - Lifestylez Ov Da Poor and Dangerous (Sony, 1995)<br />Let me first point out that Big L was indeed one of the best lyricists in the game. He could rhyme anything with anything without coming off corny and he could bring it to anyone lyrically. When he first came out, however, I must admit that I didn't really like him. I thought that his rhymes were shallow and clichéd. This album, Lifestylez..., proved me wrong, but not by much. (Side note: I know that he was murdered in 1999, but that doesn't make this album any better than I thought it was. This is my rating from 1995, when he was still alive, and it still stands today.)<br />I got this album for the song \\"Put It On\\" (his first single, I believe): dope beat, dope rhymes, and Kid Capri in the chorus made this song a winner. I didn't like his second song, \\"M.V.P.\\" (where the chorus is based off a Big Daddy Kane rhyme), but I still bought the album. Though his rhymes were at times sexist and repetitive (in a couple songs he mentions about what he would do if he caught AIDS; did he have it, perhaps?), more times than not he kicked a rhyme so unique that it made you say, \\"Did he really say that? Rewind that!\\" For example, in \\"No Endz, No Skinz\\" (produced by fellow D.I.T.C. member Show), he talks about triflin' women and how he wouldn't even give a girl 10 cents to put cheese on a Whopper. Also, the classic song in my eyes, \\"All Black\\", is worth the admission price alone.<br />The production is pretty great and so are the guest stars. On \\"8 Iz Enuff\\", L raps with fellow Children of the Corn members such as Killa Cam (now known as Cam'Ron), who actually sounded pretty good back then. In another posse cut, \\"Da Graveyard\\", a very young Jay-Z appears (\\"I get around like a wheel\\"--classic line). These guest stars break up the redundancy that sometimes appear on this album. It's too bad that he didn't know how to craft a story like he would do later with \\"The Heist\\" and \\"Casualties of a Dice Game\\". Also, some of thesongs have weak choruses, even for back then, like in \\"I Don't Understand It\\" and \\"Fed Up With the B.S.\\". But although there are a few freshman mistakes here, Big L would further perfect his skills and really destroy mikes. This album is only a taste of what he could do. To really feel Big L, check out the '98 Freestyle (Parts 1 and 2) floating around the 'Net somewhere and the rhymes that were compiled for his posthumous album, The Big Picture. -EJR
B00005JLEU|3.0|I think a lot of you guys are WAY overanalyzing this movie.  Whether or not a coherent plot line got lost in the translation is sort of beside the point.  The fact is, there wasn't one.  Yes, there were some very interesting scenes and some interestingly strange characters, and yes, my family said we basically liked it when it was over, but another thing we all said was &quot;FIVE STARS!?  I don't think so.&quot;
B00008GKEG|5.0|For years, \\"The Compleat Beatles\\" on VHS, narrated by Malcolm McDowell, was the most concise and best biography available. Paul, George, and Ringo must have watched it and decided to put out their own expanded version of it with incredible sound.
B00004RFCM|1.0|This sitcom is proof positive that we live in an anything goes society.  \\"Sex and the City\\" could very easily be titled \\"The Sodam and Gomorrah\\". Too bad we allow any and everything on tv as long as it generates money for a few.  We can not continue to turn our backs on God because one of these days God is going to leave us and not even say goodbye. If you like promiscuity sodomy, nudity, unsafe sex, etc, then this is the one for you.  I would have rated it zero but that wasn't one of the choices.

B00008PW3Q|2.0|Why did Fleetwood Mac feel they had to fill the CD to its maximum length if they had so little say?   The canvas of 45 minutes or so suited &quot;Rumours,&quot; &quot;Mirage,&quot; etc. just fine, and millions hardly complained that they weren't long enough and or that they didn't get their money's worth.  I'd rather hear a tight lean album, than wade through a rambling set of songs like &quot;Say You Will.&quot; &quot;Say You Will&quot; clocks in longer than &quot;Tusk&quot; and that adventurous, often masterful album seemed padded.  Plus, &quot;Tusk&quot; had the THREE vocal perspectives of Buckingham, Nicks, and McVie.   Sadly, McVie's warm soul is missing here, leaving a sonic and emotional hole.  We're left only with some lovely moments (mostly from Nicks) buried within Buckingham's obviously inventive but overdone production.  Overall, a major dissapointment.
B00008J4P5|4.0|Ok first let me preface this review by saying that my two favourite bands are Tool and Nine Inch Nails.  So you could say that I wasn't necessarily into this type of music.  Despite that, I found this to be a phenomenal album.  This CD just ROCKS.  I have not quite heard anything like this before.  The band's quirky flavour of blues-rock works perfectly.  I could have done without track 14, but hey, everybody deserves to have a little fun every now and then right?
B00008S2VG|5.0|Madonns has changed so much in the last five years, it's hard to imagine that the media and general public hasn't taken much notice. Still a victim of the press and a victim of her childhood hunger for fame, Madonna has stood naked before us numerous times in her career, but never as naked as she is on her fantastic new opus \\"American Life\\". 11 Tracks of consistent, challenging and touching melodies, themes range from \\"contempt of fame\\", \\"love\\" and resentment of her Father. Madonna truely seems to have let go all her anger and frustration, and is ready to love. \\"X-Static Process\\" is the most shocking song on the album, even more than the rap on \\"American Life\\". \\"In the process I forgot I was special too\\" Madonna harmonizes over an acoutic guitar - special this album is! Thank you Madonna.
B00005YW4H|2.0|Norah Jones is very overrated. So is this cd. I only gave it two stars because there are two good songs..&quot;Come Away With Me&quot; and &quot;Don't know why&quot;. I don't understand why she won a grammy. I know she is a jazz singer, but her music is so bland. I mean you can be a jazz singer with some funk and personality. Look at Billie Holiday. Well I don't recommend this album..all the songs sound almost exactly alike. Buy Alicia keys &quot;Songs in A minor&quot; instead.
B00008PW3Q|4.0|This is a really terrific CD. It definitely has that infectious Fleetwood Mac sound that has made them so popular. Of course, I miss Christine McVie. Nobody does a ballad like her. Stevie really rocks on this one; in some cases even more than her \\"Shangri-La\\". Lindsey is still wonderfully weird and crazy, and I feel compelled to skip over only one of his songs (Red Rover). I also think that having John Shanks involved in the production gives the band a new updated style. So happy to have a MAC attack again!  UPDATE:  Since posting my original review the CD is STILL in my car CD Player! (June 24, 2003)
B00005JLEU|5.0|When I first found out about Spirited Away, I didn't think that it would be good, but I was completly wrong.  This movie has everything any fan of Miyazaki's previous masterpieces would cherish.  Despite the PG rating, this movie was beyond my expectations, and I'm 15, my mother even thought it was great. I thought Hayao Miyazaki's previous films like Princess Mononoke and Castle of Cagliostro were nothing compared to Spirited Away, and they were pretty great.
0316776963|5.0|I consider myself a VERY tough cookie to crack when it comes to making me laugh via literature...but I must say, Sedaris had a walk in the park with me.  I just didn't know what hit me!  The prose was exquisite, the timing was precise, and the rythm was nothing short of perfect.  Sedaris has brought to the concept of short story/essay writing what ketchup/mustard/chopped-onions did for the hot-dog.  <br />Sedaris has set the standard for the new generation of narrative in the English language.
0440214041|3.0|As several other reviewers here have noted, the plot of this novel is based on numerous implausibilities. The biggest, to me, were <br />- that somebody could predict years in advance that a court case would reach the Supreme Court. <br />- that the bad guys would try to kill people connected to the brief when precisely that would only reinforce the credibility of an otherwise rather far-fetched theory.<br />- that the protagonist is so reluctant about sharing her brief with the world, when disseminating it would be the easiest way of ensuring that killing her had no further value for the bad guys (and indeed, they run as soon as the story is finally published).<br />To compound these issues, the novel ends with essentially the same escapist ending as _The Firm_, the Grisham novel I'd read prior to this one.<br />However, despite all these weaknesses, this was an entertaining book that made for a fun 2 days of reading. As a further redeeming merit, Grisham had a surprising flash of brilliance when he equipped this novel (written in the early 1990s) with a dimwitted, hands-off, U.S. president, run by his handlers, whose interests were mainly playing golf, packing the Supreme Court with rabid right wingers, and doing favors to his cronies.
B00006J3T4|5.0|Read most of the reviews on this record. They have said it all. But here's what I have to say:<br />1. He is the greatest Guitarist. <BR>2. A fantastic song writer.<BR>3. Sings like no one (Note the cadence in his voice. I bet no one can do that or even come close).<BR>4. ALL (\\"ALL\\") his songs, when he sings, feels so close to the heart.<br />What's disappointing is that:<BR>1. He does not get the credit he commands.<BR>2. His songs do not make it to the charts so much.<br />But who cares.... I bet MARK does not either. We fans of MARK KNOPFLER can keep our little secret to ourselves.<br />This is clearly God given talent. Creating such wonderful music time and again. This ablum is as tasteful as his older albums.<br />He is a \\"blessing in disguise\\" for music lovers. There cannot be another MARK KNOPFLER. We love you and your music, Mark.<br />An Ardent Fan !
B00005JLSE|5.0|If you like musical theatre and theatricality in your movies, you will probably love Chicago.  The film is faithful to the original Bob Fosse style, and the performances are fully committed and top notch.<br />(*sidebar note:  The user reviewer who said this film was ripping off Moulin Rouge has obviously never seen any Fosse theatre!)<br />Is the editing a little much?  Yes, a little.  It seems that one carry-over from Moulin Rouge is the \\"music video\\" style (which, hmmm, seems to be more of a music video thing than something old Bas created himself).  It makes me think of the days of the Fred Astaire films where Astaire had the clout to tell the director that the dance numbers would be full-length one-shots with no cut-aways or close-ups, and I hope that the DVD offers that option for some of the wonderful numbers from this film.<br />However, if you prefer the style of your films to be realistic (cinematography, art direction, acting), you will HATE this.  Again, it is very faithful to the theatricality of the stage production.  Be warned.  <br />Me?  I LOVED it.
B00008PW3Q|4.0|Overall the new cd from the \\"Rumours\\" lineup minus Christine is superb!  Don't get me wrong it would have been perfect had Christine McVie been a part of the project.  However Lindsey and Stevie sound fabulous together and I've always said no one can make Stevie sound best than Mick Fleewood and the Band.  Everyone of Stevie's songs are works of art and full of color and tapestry, my least fav of her's is Silver Girl, but the rest are great!  Now for Lindsey, his artistry and somewhat strange \\"out there\\" arrangements are obscure at best, sometimes it works like on Miranda and sometimes it doesn't; Come and Murrow.......way too noisy and loud!!<BR>My favorite songs are Peacekeeper, Say You Will, Illume and Goodbye Baby......which move me to tears!!<BR>Next time lets take Christine along for the ride!!
B00003CWTI|5.0|I can't believe it's taken me soooooooooooo long to finally see this film. AND I can't believe that no one spoiled it for me!

B00005R2M3|5.0|The first time I heard any of Shakira's music from this album was in the middle of the night on the radio. I was entranced by the latin beat of her single &quot;Whenever, Wherever&quot; and the energy in her voice. I set out to find out who this woman was that sang this song and discovered Shakira and her immeasurable talent. On her first English album she's done a better job than most crossover artists do, in my opinion. She's kept to her roots and included the inexcludable tracks in Spanish (Te Dejo Madrid with it's rocking-out beat and Que Me Quiedes Tu, a lovely ballad) with a classic) that are great even without a translated song included on the CD, as Whenever, Wherever (Suerte) and Objection (Te Aviso, Te Anuncio) have. Fool sympathizes over how stupid we can all sometimes be and introduces a new side of Shakira; one that knows how human we all are and can't always help what mistakes we make, such as chasing after someone and being obsessed. Poem To A Horse says all the things that I know I've always wanted to say to a stoner with nothing else going for them. I've got better things to do as well, Shaki. We're also shown her demanding side (Rules) and that even she has a certain someone she needs (The One). Eyes Like Yours is a great translation of Ojos Asi, with the help of the famous Gloria Estefan. And lastly, I've got to say that I admire a crossover artist who can write their own music with little help in a different language than their native and sound great. Rock on Shakira.

The correspondence between American writer Helene Hanff and English bookseller Frank Doel is a portrait of an unconventional friendship and a snapshot of postwar England taken by an American friend.

B00005OAIE|5.0|I will admit when John Mayer first came out I didn't like him.I think it was the video for &quot;Your body is a wonderland&quot; that killed it for me.Well a few days ago I heard &quot;Why Georgia&quot; and I was hooked.I was so wrong about his about music.Even &quot;Your body is a wonderland&quot; is a good song.It must of just been the video.I've been listening to him nonstop now.Every song on the cd is great.I plan on seeing him next month in concert.He has a raw talent that isn't found in many artist anymore.If you're not a fan, you should give him a chance. &quot;Room for Squares&quot; is one of the best cds I have heard in a long time.
B00008PW3Q|4.0|This is only the 2nd Fleetwood Mac cd I've ever bought,(the first was Rumors)and I gotta say it's pretty good. There are some really great songs, like Thrown Down, Miranda (Buckingham goes crazy near the end with his guitar!), the title track, Peacekeeper, Ilume (a 9-11 song, Fleetwood Mac style) and Silver Girl. I waited for about a month for it to come out and bought it the day it came out. Can't wait for the tour!
B00008DDXC|3.0|It seems I have the same complaint that several others do, that most of the \\"additional scenes\\" ought to be in the DVD edition.<br />I doubt that anybody connected with Harry Potter will read this, but they really ought to take a cue from Peter Jackson (Lord of the Rings) and use the DVD as an opportunity to include scenes that would have made the theatrical release too long.<br />Most of the additional scenes are not alternate takes but fully-realized scenes that were left out to - it is assumed - save time.  For example, the scene in the magic shop in Knockturn Alley with Harry hidden away spying on the Malfoys.  Why put that on Disc Two?  Why not put it in the DVD edition of the movie, where a little extra running time is not an issue?  Ditto with the scenes in Lockheart's classrom, the students gossiping about Harry's ability to speak with snakes, the discussion of the diary and the mystery of its blank pages, and so on.  All of these scenes together add up to maybe five minutes.  Putting them back into the movie would have made it more seamless, whereas leaving them out creates potholes that are noticeable, even if one doesn't know what was left out.<br />The jury's still out on whether this is great literature or not, much less great movie-making.  But in the meantime, it seems reasonable to treat this material as if it were great and take full advantage of the possibilities of what one can do on DVD.  A lot of book 3 is going to have to be left out of the next movie.  Shoot it anyway and issue an extended-version DVD.  <br />The kids are growing up.  You can't go back later and reshoot.
B000002LTU|4.0|Although there were a couple of tracks on this CD for which I didn't care, it's SO worth getting for the tracks that really stomp.  Nice counterpoint between the driving rhythms and Davis's breathy trumpet style.  Totally gets you juiced - try playing &quot;High Speed Chase&quot; while you are driving to work. No, don't.<BR>Easy Moe Bee is not a real asset on this recording- he comes across as juvenile-- really reaching for rhymes here.  But if you forget about words and consider his voice to just be part of the musical landscape, then it works.
B000002GQH|4.0|It seems to me this album is a bit underrated by some reviewers--and this doesn't surprise me, because it took me a few listens to get into it, unlike Days of Future Passed.  However, I did come to like it quite a bit.<br />As with Days of Future Passed, a Ray Thomas composition jumped immediately to the forefront--\\"Dear Diary\\" was perhaps the biggest highlight on the album for me.  This makes a wonderful song indeed for listening to out and about while people-watching.  While it definitely picks up on a sense of isolation from the rest of society, it does so without going into excessive venom and resentment, and with the catchy, almost bluesy guitar stylings, and beautiful flute solos, it is a great laid-back listen.  The other striking feature of this song is that Mr. Thomas' vocals sound almost like a shockingly good (though rather less bitter) Roger Waters impression!  The similarity is quite striking indeed, especially when he starts talking: \\"Somebody exploded an H-bomb today...\\"  Surely unintentional on Mr. Thomas' part, it is quite an ear-opener to notice.<br />\\"Lazy Day\\" also can be quite strange for a Pink Floyd fan because of the Roger Waters resemblance--as if the same voice with an entirely different technique.  I enjoy the effect from the second vocal line that seems to echo in the background, and the other layered vocals.  It is not \\"Dear Diary\\", perhaps, but enjoyable.<br />\\"Lovely to See You Again\\" has almost a CSNY vibe to it, with the harmonies and clear rock beat, and is a pleasant listen.  \\"To Share Our Love\\" also had a feeling reminiscent of CSNY, and so these songs seem like a matched set to my ear.  Both are quite enjoyable.<br />\\"So Deep Within You\\" has some of the album's most pleasant vocals--it might be said to have a strong \\"period\\" sound, but it seems to represent the *best* of its time.  The same could be said for \\"Are You Sitting Comfortably\\", especially due to its percussion.  Personally, I am reminded of songs like \\"Dust in the Wind\\" when I hear it.<br />\\"Never Comes the Day\\" is musically the most striking--the chord progression starting with the lines \\"But you will help me tonight...\\" is absolutely fascinating to me.<br />The album's weak point was for me \\"Send Me No Wine\\".  The song has a rather folkish, almost country sound to it that I find distateful (others may appreciate it--I personally dislike that kind of music); as with another reviewer, this song set me in such an awful mood on my first listening that I was ill disposed towards the entire album.  Subsequent listenings pinpointed the problem, and in my opinion it is really this one song that causes any trouble--so I skip it.<br />I also have to admit that I expected a clearer concept, when I first heard \\"In the Beginning\\", and was vaguely disappointed when it turned out to be less unified.  The sequence from \\"The Dream\\" to the second \\"Haven't You Heard\\" (I'd like to make a point here that \\"relaxing\\" should not be automatically equated with \\"boring\\"--I do not find this boring) is quite beautiful indeed.  Although the Mellotron sounds dated and awkward to modern ears, it is my understanding that it could be a very tempermental instrument to work with, so I respect Mr. Pinder for having the patience to get some pretty good sounds out of it.<br />My suggestion is, if you are looking for a more unified, tightly-constructed concept album, you may fare better with Days of Future Passed--but if your main interest is some good music, then don't overlook Threshold.  Had the option been available, I would have rated this a 3.5, but because I feel its merits outweighed its deficiencies, I've rounded up to 4.
B000069AUI|5.0|I'm fascinated by the disagreement over the quality of this Grammy-winning album by Coldplay. I'm somewhat late to the party (I own &quot;Parachutes&quot; but rarely listen to it), but then I'm almost 40 years old, a former music reviewer, and I just can't keep up with these kids today... :)<br />I knew Coldplay was a good band when I saw them perform &quot;Yellow&quot; on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; a couple of years ago. They command attention, both musically and on stage. In other words, they stand out from the rest of the British pack (Travis, Train, even Radiohead) they've been running with. Why? For starters, despite this being a rock album, there's a hush that hangs the proceedings, a gorgeous sense of melancholy tempered by knowledge that love can save us from the darkest impulses we harbor (&quot;The Scientist&quot;, &quot;Amsterdam&quot;). In other words, this is a band that constructs sophisticated and compelling metaphors both lyrically and musically, and the fact that these guys know what a metaphor is to begin with is cause enough for celebration.<br />I guess it either resonates for you or it doesn't. For me, it has an emotional core, a depth of feeling, and a haunting, almost ethereal lushness backed by pop melodies.
B00008PW3Q|4.0|It's great to see that the band is back in fine form. Not that they ever lost it. Sometimes, the public is so centered in on the youth of artists, and they forget that the longer musicians have been doing this, they can get even better. Say you will finds the gang returning to what they do best. Adult pop/rock for intelligent adults. This band does not care to be in the flavor of the month club. They just want to do their music, and hopefully the public will understand the project and embrace it. Standout tracks include the first single &quot; Peace keeper&quot;, Everybody finds out, which is a very rocking song for Stevie. Her track written about Sheryl Crow &quot;Silver Girl&quot; is a very sweet homage to her musician friend. The title track &quot;Say you Will&quot; is vintage Fleetwood Mac, and will surely be a huge hit if radio decides to play it instead of maybe someone like Limp Bizkit whose days are numbered as I am writing this. Hopefully the record buying public will stop listening to Mtv, and radio, and find great music on their own. This will be a great gem to start with. Hats off to the Mac for delivering once more. It's not &quot;Rumours&quot; but I didn't want another &quot;Rumours&quot;. I wanted something new and fresh, and that they have delivered.
0790729628|5.0|One of the best all time scifi thrillers, from one of the best directors ever, Ridley Scott.  Plus an awesome cast, portraying the android replicants...after watching, you'll be wondering who isn't a  replicant.  The story is set in futuristic Los Angeles, not too far off 2019...visually stunning, atomoshperic lighting done to perfection by the master of mood Ridley Scott.  Harrison Ford plays Rick Deckard, a cop assigned to a special unit to exterminate the Nexus 6 model of Replicants, that are deemed illegal on earth after a rather disasterous event that led to the slaughter of several people.  This director's cut version basically removes Deckard's voice over, which is good, but it would be nice to have both versions, or at least two audio tracks, for those that want to keep the original style.  This is a letterbox version, you either hate it or love it.  Definately a classic that every sci-fi fan should have!
630463949X|5.0|The Mac hits big with this set! The stage is professionally lit, the music is layered and professionally done live, lots of guitars. It's so nice to see everyone together again for their new beginning. Stevie and Lindsey do a sensitive rendition of &quot;Silver Springs&quot; and Christine nails &quot;songbird&quot; yet again. Classic Mac, a must have.
B000063DFQ|4.0|I think \\"Piece of Mind\\" is among the three best Iron Maiden albums. The \\"Number of the Beast\\" in its entirety and parts of \\"Powerslave\\" and \\"Somewhere in Time\\" would assume the same status. In my opinion it is hard to rank Maiden albums because of the lack of consistent good songs on entire albums. In other words, many Maiden albums have weak/poppy points. For instance, I think parts of Powerslave and \\"Seventh Son of a Seventh Son\\" are very weak, but they have strong points as well. Piece of Mind and The Number of the Beast, I think come closest to being consistently good, \\"listen straight through\\" albums. The first side of Piece of Mind is amazing!!!! The second side is still very good, but it is the reason I give the album 4 stars instead of five. However, \\"To Tame a Land\\" grew on me; I really like Harris' bass work in this song. But just to put this review in perspective, I can't really name a 5 -star album from this period. Off the top of my head, Probably the closest 5 -star album in this genre from a different band would be Judas Priests' \\"Defenders of the Faith,\\" but I would still only give this masterpiece 4.5 stars max.
B0000035E7|4.0|this album is really good.  it captures the intesity of nirvana in a way only ... recording could seem to do (although the intensity is obviously there on the other albums).  what an inspiration if you are a musician!  look at this album.  it sounds like it was recorded on your friends four-track!  it just goes to show if you have emotion and can learn how to put it in lyrics and music (the hardest part) then you can touch the stars!  (obviously i'm being sappy, but you could still get people to like your band this way).
0345448898|5.0|First of all to those people who think this book is blasphemous,<BR>it's just a BOOK! It's not going to HURT anyone.<BR>Besides that, I think these books are so amazingly great. Some of the characters are difficult to place on the good or the bad side, and I like that. Most characters in books are so obviously good or bad that you get bored. And to those who say the books are depressing, well, so is life sometimes! As another reviewer said, you have to take the bad with the good. These books are very different than other books I've read, butI found that they were different in a good way, and so I would definitely reccomend these books!<BR>Go and get them!

B000069AUI|5.0|This short review should be taken with caution, as I have no background in recent \\"alternative\\" music. That being said, this album is excellent. First listen, uhhhh it all sounds the same, second listen---well there are a few catchy tunes, third listen, whoa, this is something good. Some of this music is perfect, and don't be put off because the first song is the only sloper. Everything else builds. <br />One complaint---there are no lyrics in the liner notes. I get it, but I just want to understand their heads as well as their music. Dot com suggestions in the liner notes mean that I like their instincts but not their pragmatism.<br />But, if I could give this 5+ I would. I can't imagine anyone who likes the music who would not also identify with the issues. Theraputic for me, especially green eyes and amsterdam.
B00006DEFA|5.0|There's a moment early in Amadeus when court composer Antonio Salieri (F. Murray Abraham) wanders through a crowded salon in search of the famed prodigy known to him by reputation only: Mozart. Inspecting each young musician, he looks for some outward sign of genius: the \\"man who had written his first concerto at the age of four, his first symphony at seven, and a full-scale opera at 12.\\"<BR> Soon after, we and with Salieri first lay eyes on Mozart - not the halo-crowned demigod built up in music history classes, but instead a mischievous, arrogant vulgar puck with a cackling laugh. But Milos Forman's stunning epic did not win eight Academy Awards for simply reducing classical music royalty to child-like stature.<BR> Instead of attempting to simply be a biographical sketch of a master, the story is told by an aged Salieri who - now committed to a sanitarium after a suicide attempt - confesses his desperate tale to a priest. From that first meeting, Salieri grows ever more jealous of the impish Mozart's gift, and increasingly angry with the God whom he feels has forsaken him after a lifetime of \\"servitude.\\" Ultimately, he plots to get rid of his nemesis the old fashioned way - murder. It's a pathetic fable of mediocrity's envy of brilliance, and the cursed mission to overcome God's will. All this set against the striking backdrop of 18th-century Vienna - in all its filth and splendor, driven by the virtuosity of Mozart's compositions.<BR> Amadeus is one of those magical and rare films with a nearly perfect mixture of beautiful writing, glorious music, elegant cinematography, remarkable acting, dazzling art direction, and an engrossing story. It ranges from grand to ribald, from hilarious to heartbreaking, from chilling to endearing. It put relative no-names like F. Murray Abraham in the spotlight, and furthered the already promising careers of greats like director Milos Forman. And it is by far one of my favorite films of all time.<BR> The bad news about this new Director's Cut is that not too much has changed from the original, but the good news is that not too much has changed from the original. While the trailers boast 20 minutes of additional material, the deleted scenes are nothing to write home about, although they are sewn tidily into the original to make the film look virtually unchanged. Only one additional scene sheds new light on a slightly confusing moment from the original, explaining why later in the film Mozart's wife Constanze (Elizabeth Berridge) is coarse with Salieri when she finds him tending to Mozart on his deathbed. Otherwise, the new clips are simple distractions, generally reiterating points already well-defined the first time around or giving us a couple of new laughs.<BR> The big improvement is truly in the remastering of the images and soundtrack, which will be especially noticeable for those who have never seen Amadeus on the big screen. On the other hand, the reissue's greatest drawback is its attention-span challenging three-plus hour length (188 minutes). But  you don't have to be daunted. Great films like this one make a numb butt worth the bother.<BR> <BR>Watching this movie, you learn love, hate and honor. One of my friend studies music in school. He always said his all time favoirte musician is Wolfgag Amadeus Mozart. Honistly I didn't know why but after watching this movie, I understand why his favoirte musiciain is Mozart. It was pretty long movie. Just make sure you go to the bathroom right before the trailers.
0553212621|5.0|Connie Chatterley's life is droll and boring with her handicapped husband in the industrial wasteland of post-WWI England. She soon starts an affair with the gruff estate games-keeper, Mellors.<br />The entire book seems to me a direct attack on industrialisation, keeping with that theme (industrialisation v. nature) in Lord Chatterley and Mellors; Connie (perhaps she is the embodiment of the people in our culture) knows what she wants, but is still torn. <br />There is a small scene where Lord Chatterley takes his motorised chair out into the park, and it gets stuck in the mud. He refuses help from Connie or Mellors several times, but when he finally gives up, he ingraciously orders Mellors (who is ill) to push his chair out of the mud. Connie looks down at the muddy tyre marks, and sees all the crushed little bluebells. <br />It's almost like industrialisation doesn't really work, but we feel like it *must*, so we insist that it's fine and there's nothing else we need acknowledge. Sooner or later, however, we're going to throw our hands up and say \\"Fine! You were right. Push the damn chair.\\" And only then will we see the damage we've done.
B000002A46|5.0|Wow. At times that's all I can say when I listen to Mariah's Christmas CD. Hands down, this is her VERY best work, no questions asked. She simply doesn't get any better than she does right here, with this album. The beautiful singing here is absolutely incredible, and it's not hard to see why this is one of the best selling holiday CD's out there. Yes, I'm sure we can all admit that Mariah has had a harder time recently with her career, but when you go back and listen to stuff like this from her earlier days, you walk away spellbound at what an amazing voice she truly does have.<br />The only track on this CD that I don't care for much is &quot;Miss You Most at Christmastime&quot;; I usually skip that one. Aside from that one interruption, I can always put in this CD and listen to it from beginning to end, and love every minute of it. This is the only CD I can do that with, honestly. &quot;Oh Holy Night&quot; is, to me, a standout on the entire album (it really gives you the chills), but there are some other winners on here: &quot;All I Want For Christmas Is You,&quot; &quot;Jesus Born on This Day&quot; (my second favorite), &quot;Joy to the World,&quot; &quot;Silent Night,&quot; and a whole string of other classic holiday carols that, as another reviewer commented, were made completely Mariah's own. She chose songs that are perfect for her singing style, and she really touches on your spiritual side here. Being a Christian myself, I am uplifted every time I listen, without fail. Mariah uses this album to sing her heart out on some of the most beautiful Christmas songs ever known, plus she even writes and performs 3 of her own. It is wonderful music bursting with the holiday spirit everyone loves.<br />If you're any kind of Mariah fan at all, you need to have this album. If you only buy one CD of hers in your entire life, this is most likely the best choice you could possibly make. No penny could possibly be poorly spent on a CD like this. If you're like me you'll be tempted to listen to it all year long, even though it's the magical season of Christmas that truly makes it the magical and miraculous piece of work that it is. As corny as it may sound, this is the type of music that will honestly lift you up all through the holiday season; it is highly recommended.
B00005YW4H|4.0|... Eventually I bought it and I could say that I did not like it at start but after three or four times listening to all the songs, I actually changed my mind. The songs are very pleasant, easy to listen two and accompanied by a fine play of piano. I am really glad that this kind of music won best album, I was getting desperate with the English people taste in music. My favorites out of this LP are, off course, \\"Don't Know Why\\", \\"Come away with me\\", but also some catchy songs like \\"Lonestar\\", \\"I've got to see you again\\" and the lovely \\"One Flight Down\\". Don't be reluctant to buy, if you like nice and easy music.

B00005JKDR|5.0|This is a cute movie, but my children who were 5 and 3 at the time I bought this thought the movie was boring.  It's about monsters in a closet that have to reach a certain quota of scaring little children at night.  One monster got an attachment to a child he scared.  Anyway, I think I was more entertained by the movie than my children were.

B00008DDSC|3.0|I agree with another reviewer's observation that this film suddenly changes near the end. All that is achieved in the first four-fifths of the film is diluted in the last fifth by a too complete and convenient (for the film maker) resolution. It's as if the director and the writers after making a great effort for such a long time suddenly succumbed to laziness. The bulk of the film is worth watching but be prepared for a letdown at the end.

B00008PW3Q|4.0|This is exactly what I expected of Fleetwood Mac,, A great work of art, I love it and think that any true blue Fleetwood Mac fans will find this is probably some of their best work ever.  Running through the Garden is my favorite so far and Stevie Nicks still has one of the most beautiful voices. Murrow turning over in his grave, wow this is  a Fleetwood Mac song at its best, I love this. I may have to get a second copy from wearing this one out. I love this band, grew up with them and keep loving them more now.
B00005MKA1|5.0|I've pulled out the original 1978 Tuff Gong release on vinyl, blew the dust off of it, and gave it a spin after 20 years. I've listened to the CD and I can honestly say that this remastered version is fairly comparable to the original.<br />This is a truely beautiful album. <br />... It is in fact a political statement - listen to the album again in it's entirety - it is one big political statement not love songs (chuckle). Yes Bob is in love with KAYA that \\"lil brown gal\\". p.s. KAYA=Ganja=woman.<br />The album is not as blatently political as the previous albums. You have to remember this album was written after Marley was shot and his political statements are more translucent.<br />This album is best if listened to from beginning to end the way it was written and meant to be heard. KAYA was made in the era when conceptual albums were \\"in\\", unlike the 1 hit wonder albums of today that has one popular song and 9 other disjointed nonrelavent songs. Thank your monoplolized big name record industry for that and for dictating our airwaves with songs of plastic love and false hope.  <br />...  <br />This album is timeless and I'm sure my children will listen to and appreciate this album when their time comes.<br />Warning: if you have conservative ideologies - you will not understand this album and think the devil himself wrote this album. ...
B00005JLH3|5.0|I would like to start off my saying it was time for a band movie to be made. Every time i go to the movies it is always something about a football, basketball, and get this, even cheerleading. Well move all that to the side and make room for the baddest movie of all time. You know what it is, I'm talking about DRUMLINE. This movie has it all, good music, stars, fun, and action. It shows you how to be the best when the best is already out there, and how to work together as a team. I love this movie and everybody needs to go and cop it for it is sold out everywhere.
B00008DDXC|5.0|I agree with most of the reviewers. Excellent film. The book was better, but the translation to film was faithful. I have only one thing to add. When the film ended in the theaters, most people left before the ten minutes of credit scrolled by. Too Bad, because when the credits end, the film goes back to Diagon Alley for one last joke. The DVD preserves this little bit of humor and shows the last laugh at the end of the credits.
B00008I8IF|4.0|I mostly agree with the amazon editorial review above except for \\"one man's problem.\\" This song is a top five jayhawks all time song, and the verse does not drag. Otherwise most of the first half of the album is very strong, but the second half is hit or miss and the songs not written by Gary Louris pretty much [are bad]. If you are not familiar with the jayhawks, go buy \\"hollywood town hall\\" or \\"tomorrow the green grass\\" first, and then come back to this album.

B00005JLEU|5.0|I wasnt really expecting this movie at the beginning. About first 45 minutes, so many strange creatures were shown up, and I was thinking What a weird movie this is!? But when the story was getting to the end, my tears came up and didnt stop. <br />Chihiro was an ordinary 10 years old girl, who was kind of lazy and always complaining about something. She was suddenly transferred into a strange world where her parents were spelled by a witch, and turned into pigs. There were so many strange creatures in that world. They were mean to Chihiro at the begging. They seemed to be so greedy and selfish. They were only nice to rich people, but mean to someone with dirty looking. They were just interested in making money, playing, and have delicious meals. But unlike those creatures, what Chihiro wanted was to save her parents who had turned into pigs. She worked very hard as much as she could. She treated everyone equally, and she showed her love to those who looked dirty, and lonely. Finally, her love changed the way they were.  <br />In that world, people were all forgot his/her past, even his/her original name; they are all taken away by a witch. But Chihiros love brought a boys past back, a river spirit who saved Chihiro when she fell into the river. <br />This is NOT a movie to entertain actions, and adventure. This movie might appear little difficult who is not sensitive. This is a story about love. Ive watched three times and cried three times. Its never happened to me in any other movie in my life.
B00000GJ2B|5.0|&quot;Raging Bull&quot; is a masterpiece and it is my favorite Robert De Niro and Martin Scorsese picture. Based on a true story, De Niro, in his Oscar-winning role, plays Jake La Motta, a middle-weight boxer, who is basically ill-tempered and out of control. Joe Pesci and Cathy Moriarty are fabulous in their supporting roles, and they were Oscar-nominated. &quot;Raging Bull&quot; is an excellent movie, and it should have won the Best Picture for 1980. Martin Scorsese's direction is flawless, and he should have won the Best Director Oscar. I have this movie on video, and I highly recommend it.
0385507755|5.0|finally, someone with a life story actually interesting enough to merit a memoir, and a writing style -- bursting with energy and poetry -- that lives up to the life it describes.  a million little pieces is a book that makes you think without being a book for so-called thinking people. it pulls you so uncomfortably close to its unimaginable world that it may be too much for those who like their books to keep them at a distance. but those who make it through, buoyed by frey's visceral, kinetic prose, will be rewarded by a heartfelt yet unsentimental tribute to one man's basic ability to survive on his own terms.
0679720200|5.0|I dont like to rate works of art, but that being said, this is probably my favorite novel to date. It is the story of a seemingly dispassionate young man who stumbles into an arbitrary situation which eventually forces him to confront his own mortality. The majority of the story recounts the events that lead to this confrontation.  Throughout the events, many of which are quite dramatic, the character remains  emotionally detatched.  <BR>There is a sense of nihilism in his reflections.  But by the last chapter his nihilism trancends rational antibelief into something equally godless, equally meaningless, yet something far more real, far more irrational and far more human.    It is in the last chapter where the novel flowers from rugged minimalist narrative into powerful and poetic philosophical prose. The theme is expanded from the particular to the universal, and Camus establishes himself as the most passionate voice of the existentialist movement.
0385507755|5.0|It is rare that an author's prose can take you by the arm and propel you so fiercely, yet vividly through such an horrific and moving experience. The powerful imagery and storytelling surges through you as you accompany the author on his quest for sobriety and sanity.

B000002IWQ|3.0|This album isn't bad, but half of it is unfortunately uninspired.  Running down track by track:<br />1.  Animate - Dull chorus, but a nice backbeat.  Also Alex Lifeson's guitar work is rather pedestrian.<BR>2.  Stick It Out - Very heavy guitar-oriented rock song that almost smacks of an attempt at commercialism.  (The real commercial song will come later.)  Still catchy in its way.<BR>3.  Cut to the Chase - Ignoring the catchphrasey title, this is a pretty solid song, probably one of the best.  Nice heavy and emotional middle eight.<BR>4.  Nobody's Hero - ostensibly a sensitive song about how to properly find heroes, this song still has no cohesion.  Like &quot;Second Nature&quot; from Hold Your Fire, the verse and chorus feel slammed together without any regard as to whether they fit.<BR>5.  Between Sun and Moon - Alex delivers a likably funky blues guitar lick here, with Geddy going into &quot;mystical Robert Plant&quot; mode.<BR>6.  Alien Shore - I personally like this song; it builds rather nicely, although unfortunately the chorus sounds like something we've heard before from this band.<BR>7.  The Speed of Love - apparently is very slow and turgid.<BR>8.  Double Agent - Some people hate that spoken part.  My complaint with it is the &quot;Frankensong&quot; quality of two song sections that have been stitched together awkwardly.<BR>9.  Leave That Thing Alone - a decent instrumental, nothing too spectacular.<BR>10.  Cold Fire - the real commercial song on this album.  Catchy although probably not the sort of song Rush fans want to hear.<BR>11.  Everyday Glory - should be inspiring, but it doesn't really go anywhere.<br />Probably as a whole this is a mediocre album, but it's got enough good points that it's worth getting used if you're a Rush fan.
B00003CXXM|3.0|For the most part, this is a pretty straight-forward action film.  While it has a different setting and different stars than what we're used to seeing, it has the standard car chases, fistfights and gun battles that we're used to seeing in this kind of movie.  Damon was good, as was Franka Potente, but there was really nothing to set this film apart from any other.<br />The thing that drove me nuts about this movie was that with the exception of the title and the Character names, there was very little in common with the book.  Bourne's whole reason for existing was deleted from the movie, and his true identity was remarkably reshaped.<br />Not bad, but not terribly different from most other films of this genre.
B0000027I6|5.0|This one is by far Roger Waters' best solo effort.  It took me a couple listens to get used to this one because it was a little different than Radio KAOS and Pros and Cons, but it was worth the effort getting used to.  This one was seemingly written in response to the first Gulf War, but it has even more relevance to the second Gulf War.<BR>I was watching stuff from the recent war in Iraq and I almost felt like I was watching the ultimate in reality TV, especially with the embedded reporters.  This album seems to bring that to the forefront.  Especially in the song, \\"Bravery of Being Out of Range\\".  Listening to that song, I can imagine people sitting in a bar somewhere and watching the war.<BR>anyways, this album has everything you come to expect from Roger Waters.  Biting lyrics, good music and a theme.  It is well worth a listen.
B00008PW3Q|1.0|This ain't the warm and fuzzy Fleetwood Mac of the days of old, not by a long shot, so let that be your warning. What we have is 76+ minutes of strange/weird vibe noodlings. The only track that I would consider a possible hit is 'Destiny Rules', a fine Stevie Nicks track. Christine McVie wisely bowed out of this affair even though she is listed as an 'extra musician'. As usual, too much Lindsey and his weird ramblings and odd singing.<BR>The sound is definitely not Fleetwood Mac, so be prepared. Time to retire folks.
6303913881|1.0|I had the misfortune of stumbling across the last 45 mins. of this (bowdlerized) flick on TV a few nights ago.  I had hoped to stumble upon a redeeming quality, but I never did. This movie can best be described as high-gloss, highly-produced, heavily-veiled porn that passes itself off as mainstream entertainment.  It's a great movie if you're into exotic dancing and topless girls, but if not, you're better off moving onto something else.I cringed at each sight of Elizabeth Berkley's straggly, curly mop hair and too-big lips.
B00003CX5P|1.0|This film, like the rest of the Star Wars prequels, is utter garbage. It's become apparent that Lucas cares only about the technical aspects of moviemaking, and not the need for good storytelling.<br />The dialogue is pretentious and awful. Jar Jar Binks is insulting, even to a child's intelligence. Jake Lloyd is the worst child actor in history. Gary Coleman could have played a better Anakin Skywalker!<br />Some of the plot elements don't even jive with what Lucas filmed years ago. Anakin created 3PO? The Force is a bunch of microbial entities in your bloodstream? Anakin was an immaculate conception? <br />I suppose the writing was on the wall when Lucas ruined his own masterpieces in the forms of the Epidode 4,5,6 &quot;Special Editions.&quot; Greedo shoots at Han first? I don't think so.

B00005YU1O|4.0|This is a beguiling film, although it could be accused of instilling a sense of 'metaphysical nausea' (as one critic put it) in its viewers. The sheer breadth and depth of the theory expounded on (ranging from the thought-provoking to the truly banal) militates against any useful critique of the film: no film of a length 2 1/2 hours could possibly hope to cover everything in any remote conception of what could be termed 'sufficient detail'. The advanced rotoscoping techniques yield tremendous didvidends, with the art work enhancing instead of literalizing the visuals: crucial in a film with such unique pretensions. Expands on director Linklater's free form style along with the likes of 'Slacker' and 'Dazed and Confused', although this film is in a completely different league. Definately worth a watch.

IT TOOK ME A COUPLE OF LISTENS TO GET THROUGH THE WHOLE THING, AT FIRST I THOUGHT ALL THE SONGS SOUNDED THE SAME, BUT NOW I CAN'T LISTEN TO ANYTHING ELSE. UPON MY FIRST FULL LISTEN, I WAS VERY SURPIRSED WHEN WHAT HAS BECOME MY FAVORITE TRACK \\"WHISPER\\" ENDED WITH CHANTING AND VIOLINS, A WELCOME CHANGE FOR MY EARS. OTHER FAVES ARE \\"TAKING ME OVER\\",\\"MY IMMORTAL\\" AND \\"HAUNTED\\" (I LOVE TO LISTEN TO THIS SONG AND SING ALONG ON MY DRIVE TO WORK. HOWEVER I FIND MYSELF GOING A LITTLE TOO FAST). I'VE HEARD THEM DESCRIBED AS EITHER TORI AMOS OR SARAH MCLACHLAN WITH LINKIN PARK OR KORN SO IF ANY OF THOSE COMBINATIONS INTRIGUES YOU, I STRONGLY RECOMMEND YOU PURCHASE THIS CD. IF THAT DOESN'T APPEAL TO YOU BUT YOU LIKE \\"BRING ME TO LIFE\\" I STRONGLY RECOMMEND THAT YOU PURCHASE THIS CD. I DOUBT VERY HIGHLY THAT YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME!

B00008CLOA|2.0|Being a Pink Floyd fan, I have purchased every version of this album since it was released 30 years ago.<br />By far the best version is the SQ Quadraphonic LP version, but as far as the stereo mix goes, the original UK Harvest CD (made in Japan) is still the high point.<br />Ten years ago, the fine engineer Doug Sax made a valiant effort, but it is clear listening to that XXth Aniversary Edition CD that the original tapes no longer have the same dynamics they originally had (magnetic analog storage slowly loses it quality).<br />Nevertheless, I decided to give this new 30th Anniversary CD a try.  I should mention here that this is only a review of the standard stereo tracks - I don't yet have an SACD-capable player.<br />However this release doesn't make me want to run out and buy one.  My worst fears have been realized as once again, the overall mix of the album has been lost in favor of &quot;resolving power&quot;, ie the ability to hear little details.   The problem is that after applying techniques to bring out such details, the engineers have done nothing to restore the original mix of the album.<br />The result is like a starving artist's copy of a Rembrandt painting - it sounds something like Dark Side of the Moon, but when you hear the real thing, you realize that it is only a faded imitation.<br />The problem is that few people these days have access to what it actually sounds like.   Almost no one listens to their LP versions, and only a handful of people are lucky enough to own the original UK Harvest CD.   Furthermore, it seems clear that the engineers of this 30th Anniversary Edition haven't listened to the original, either.<br />Interestingly, the original engineer, Alan Parsons, asked to be involved in this 30th Anniversary Edition project, but was shut out.   It would seem that future listeners suffer as a result.<br />PS  My qualifications:  I am a California state certified Studio Recording Engineer.   One of my instructors was the original engineer for the drum recordings for &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot;.  I compared the 30th Anniversary Edition, XXth Anniversary Edition, and UK Harvest CDs using AKG K240 Studio Monitor headphones (as used in many studio recording situations over the past 20-30 years).
B00008PW3Q|5.0|I have been an avid Fleetwood Mac fan for as long as the Buckingham-Nicks version of the band has been around, sticking with them even through the midly disappointing Mirage album and the hugely disappointing Tango in the Night.  It was worth waiting around for them to come back to top form and surpass themselves.  I have to admit, I've usually skipped over Christine McVie's tracks as too middle-of-the-road pop and a bit trite.  So I can't say I miss her presence much.  I have long thought that Stevie Nicks is the most consistent song-writer in the band, but, and I never thought I'd admit this, Lindsey blows her away this time around.  He has overlain the inventiveness and quirkiness that marked some of his more &quot;rough-edged&quot; tunes on Tusk with the melodiousness that is Fleetwood Mac's signature sound.  And his lyrics show a richness and maturity seldom seen in his earlier work, which has always been a bit &quot;spare&quot; in the word department.  Nicks' self-focus and meandering lyrics and melodies are getting a bit tiresome; still, her voice sounds better than it has in years and there is simply no one on earth who can blend voices with Lindsey Buckingham like she does.  &quot;Miranda&quot; is the best track on the CD.  The back-to-back &quot;Say Goodbye&quot; and &quot;Goodbye Baby&quot; are gorgeous and so emotionally charged that you can't help but have a good cry the first time through, no matter how unsentimental you are, once you realize whom they're singing to.
B000089RVX|5.0|Hello everyone, first of all lets just say I'm a fan of all types of music, but this is the best i've heard!!! I'm in love with Amys voice, it takes you on an emotional roller coaster.  The music behind it goes with every lyric and pitch of her voice perfectly. On track two \\"bring me to life\\" Paul sounds like Mike from linkin park, but the rest of the album is even better, it touches me deeply. I personally think the heavy riff with female vocal thing is awesome, but not just a common female vocal, Amys is special just hear it and you'll know, i get goosebumps everytime.  Theres another band called \\"Lacuna Coil\\" its alright, but lacks the energy that Evanescence brings to the table.  Every song from start to finish is good, but my personal favorites is \\"going under\\", \\"tourniquet\\" and track 5 and 8 I forgot the name though.  But the ending to track five is so strong it'll make the hair on your forearm rise!! Linkin Park is good but Evanescence is better.
0385504209|2.0|This is the second book in which Brown decides to make the Catholic Church look like a bunch of deceitful, fanatical, and desperate bunch of wackos.  Brown knows how to write a book, but I frankly am tired of all this speculation.  In this one, we find out what Brown thinks the Holy Grail is, and other assorted \\"facts\\" drawn through the ages.  Give it a rest, Dan.  You're a good writer, as shown in \\"Deception Point,\\" but leave the church alone.<br />NOT RECOMMENDED.
0684833395|5.0|I'm hesitant to call this book an anti-war novel. I think that's too simple of a generalization for a novel that deserves a much more in-depth look. For me, Catch-22 in about the human condition which leads us to experience fear, selfishness, anger, anguish, loneliness, pain, and every other imaginable emotion. I think the greatest thing about this novel is that Heller, in about 90% of the novel, seems unconcerned with passing judgement and instead chooses to give us the raw reality of these characters and lets the rest be decided by the reader.<br />Heller creates a chaotic athmosphere filled by exotic characters that are never censored. The narrative is consistently odd but it never seems to stray too far from its purpose, or plot. The first three quarters of the book are hillarious, followed by a somber, pensative tone completely brutal and unforgiving. You don't realize how quickly it goes from a satirical, cynical place to a completely harsh reality. The transition is amazing and the result a complete shock to the reader.<br />This is a wonderful piece of literature. Heller lets his characters speak for themselves and he lets their actions create the moral statements of the novel. That in itself is a huge accomplishment.<br />This is a great book regarldess of your view on war.
B00008PW3Q|4.0|I've been listening to Fleetwood Mac since the blues days. My favorite period is still the Bob Welch era. I was working for a record store when the &quot;white&quot; album came out and Billboard magazine transposed Lindsey and Stevie's name on the ad for the album. The following week they had an apology and reran the ad. Time went on, and my close brush with fame came when I painted a collage of album covers which was considered for their Greatest Hits LP. But, it wasn't chosen, although I did get paid by Warner Bros and it's a fun story to tell. As far as the new one, I'm glad to see them back and I really hope it works for them. Christine is obviously missing, and her style and writing is truly missed. But most of Mac is better than no Mac. Will the public support it, and will there be another one someday... let's hope so, as the talent is still there, but please get Christine to make a more obvious appearance.
B00008PW3Q|3.0|The problem with albums by big rock bands is that they either have to be monotonously similar to previous albums we all loved, or they must diverge from the familiar and become uncomfortable for longtime fans.  The former is a rather a sellout, and no band should stop growing.  SAY YOU WILL reaches toward something different, placing itself in the latter category, but I'm not sure it's growth<br />Since 1977, I have purchased Fleetwood Mac and Stevie Nicks albums the minute they go on sale, rushed home and listened to every song while carefully referencing the lyrics sheets.  It has become a ritual.   With SAY YOU WILL, though, for the first time ever, I had to take off the headphones in the middle of the album - my ears just hurt.  <br />That's not to say that SAY YOU WILL is a bad album.  Some of Buckingham's most interesting material to date is on this incredibly long CD.  \\"Murrow Turning Over in His Grave\\" is unique for Fleetwood Mac, and \\"Peacekeeper\\" is a long awaited Buckingham Nicks redux that convinces me I'm listening to that ancient but wonderful album by two kids in the 70s.  <br />For long-time Stevie Nicks fans, those mysterious and illegally circulated demos we all loved have reappeared in a fully produced format.  \\"Smile at You,\\" one of Nick's angrier songs, is intriguing in Buckingham's production.  The bitter lyrics pitted against tribal drum beats and a moody guitar prove quite successful.  \\"Running Through the Garden\\" reminds me of an early 80's Stevie, rich in imagery and a great showcase to her throaty, ethereal voice.  Of course, \\"Goodbye Baby,\\" AKA \\"The Tower\\" is a definite weeper whose meaning, I think, has nothing to do with a lover, per se, but something Nicks has never dealt with in public before.<br />I spite of its virtues, the album gets extremely heavy.  Buckingham's guitars get so loud, one's eardrums nearly burst, and lyrics are lost in a muddy pit of sounds and sped up voices.  \\"Come\\" is dreary, and \\"Red Rover\\" is so pretentious Iexpect Bono and Madonna to suddenly burst from my CD player pretending to be world saviors or whatever they claim to be this week.  \\"Bleed to Love Her\\" sounded better live.<br />Some of Stevie's material is so horrendously overproduced, I wonder if she even recognizes her songs.  \\"Illume,\\" a terrifying recollection of September 11, gets lost in a bizarre, mid 80's new wave style production.  \\"Silver Girl\\" warbles so badly, I thought my CD player had broken.<br />It's a shame.  Lyrically, the band is in excellent form, though I will say I don't understand why Nicks repeats a line about loving coastal cities in two separate songs (really, the entire stanza).  There is also a bit of repetitive chorus work in a few songs by both Nicks and Buckingham, but overall, the songs have meaning and are stimulating.  <br />In my humble view, Nicks' recent TROUBLE IN SHANGRI-LA album was a much better project.  While I don't think Sheryl Crow has really proven herself, SHANGRI-LA worked well.  The album's tracks told a story from beginning to end, and each flowed well into the next without being repetitive or boring.<br />Buckingham really needs to get over his desire to be \\"an envelope pusher.\\"  This is Fleetwood Mac, and they should just be what they are.  The smooth \\"Rumors,\\" \\"Mirage,\\" and \\"Tango in the Night\\" are the band's biggest hits for a reason.  <br />I am not suggesting that the band should repeat what it has already done.  Certainly artistic growth is a good thing, but it can be accomplished in ways that don't lose the artist.  I don't agree with Buckingham that in order to be artistic you have to be unpalatable.  It's like painting with excrement - it isn't art just because you think it's controversial.<br />I will still recommend SAY YOU WILL for its gems, and I know I'll be humming Nicks' chorus to the title track forever, I just think they should have taken a step back on this one.  Yes, you have talent, and you have lasted a long time, but that isn't a bad thing that you should try to shoot down.  Do what you do and grow with it.  Don't produce a garage metal album just for the sake of being provocative.  <br />Fleetwood Mac still remains relevant, but this album just isn't a full blown great album.<br />My apologies, Stevie and Lindsey.
B00008PW3O|5.0|The songs on this CD are some of the most interesting music FM has recorded.  After listening to the songs 3 or 4 times, the onnes that stick in my mind are Thrown Down, Running Through the Garden, (finally a Stevie song with passionate vocals that comes close to Edge of 17), Silver Girl, Smile At You.  Lindsey has some great cuts as well--What's the World Coming To, Steal Your Heart Away, Bleed to Love Her.  I didn't care for Come, and Murrow Turning Over in his Grave.  The title track Say You Will and Peackeeper are more top 40 oriented pop, with that familiar FM sound that I've loved for years.  I have the enhanced limited edition CD...
B00005JLH3|1.0|Few things are more pathetic than Band Geeks Gone Wild. In this utterly forgettable piece of winsome ... , we have a two-note Nick star (think Britney Spears' little sister with less talent) who doesn't have a clue, tries to pretend third row drummers are hot instead of the pushed around pathos-inducing loser with whose girlfreinds football players screw around. The idea that this kid somehow can become a star or something original, or that an Orlando Jones character wouldn't be laughed off any field because NO ONE takes cheerleaders, dancers, or band members seriously is so so hilarious i nearly cried.<BR>   Lobotomies should be required for the makers of this movie, but I don't think they make microscopes that small.
B00006RU5B|5.0|Chris Cornell has touched every side of rock, but none fits him better than the hard core riffs of Tom Morello.  While Cornell has sounded magnificent in Temple of the Dog, Soundarden, and even solo in the album Sweet Euphoria, when I listen to Audioslave it is obvious that his voice belongs to hard rock.  Rage Against the Machine, one of my favorite bands, may take one step down the ladder if we get to hear more from Audioslave.  Sorry Zack.<br />I'm not sure exactly what part of the music makes me think this, but Audioslave reminds me of a modern day Led Zeppelin.  I couldn't tell you the number of the times I've listened to the album all the way through, but it seems to get better every time I listen to it.<br />While on the radio I've heard I've heard both &quot;Cochise&quot; and &quot;Like A Stone&quot; and seen both their videos on MTV, the strongest tracks lie elsewhere.  Both &quot;Show Me How To Live&quot; and &quot;Gasoline&quot; will give you an adrenaline rush you won't believe.  My favorite track, which happens to be the slowest track on the album, is titled &quot;Getaway Car&quot; and shows that the extremely hard band can mix it up well.  &quot;Set It Off&quot; and &quot;Exploder&quot; will both require that you leave your seat and scream the lyrics at the top of your lungs.<br />The combination of one of the hardest alternative groups of the '90s and the most magnificent voice in rock delivers one of rock's latest masterpieces.  If you haven't purchased Audioslave yet, do so quickly before you miss out on it any longer.
0316666343|1.0|After all the hype, I expected more.  I kept plugging away, but could not get interested and finally gave up, something I rarely do.
0385503954|1.0|Truly an awful book.  It is, by turns, turgidly written and so overwrought as to be unreadable.  The characters are uniformly easy either to dislike or to be bored by.  The plot is nothing short of silly, including a moronic \\"surprise\\" ending that adds nothing at all except to remind you how pointless, shallow, and empty the rest of the book is. The book is so poorly done that I almost suspected McEwan of intentionally carricaturing a certain kind of British novel of manners.  A waste of time, money, ink, and paper.
B00004Z459|4.0|When I first heard Linkin Park's Chester Bennington pleading \\"shut up when I'm talking to you\\" on \\"One Step Closer,\\" I blew them off as yet another nu-metal band on the radio riding the latest sound. But by the time monster tracks like \\"In the End\\" came out and I found myself singing the lyrics long after the radio was off, I thought there might be something to these guys.<br />Many platinum albums later, it turns out there was. \\"Hybrid Theory\\" perfects the genre brought to prominence by bands like Korn and Limp Bizkit. The reasons for the album's success are simple: Linkin Park smoothes out the rough edges of \\"rap-rock\\" (or fill in your own generic term) and distills it into an album that is tough without the chest-thumping, introspective without being too whiney and heavy enough to maintain its street cred. Songs like \\"Papercut\\" and \\"One Step Closer\\" have less issues than Korn's Jonathan Davis and give you a glimpse of what Wes Borland could have done if he wasn't hanging around with Fred Durst. \\"Crawling\\" and \\"In the End\\" are the album's best tracks simply because of the intense energy and huge melodic hooks coming from Bennington and Mike Shinoda, as well as guitarist Brad Delson. But strip them down (as they do on \\"Reanimation\\") and you still have powerful songs that are emotional and highly accessible. For the most part, this album is full of catchy, well-crafted songs.<br />Beyond this, it seems reasonable to say that after this album, rap-rock has little place else to go, only because \\"Hybrid Theory\\" covers every aspect of it so well.
B000089RVX|5.0|The band is great, when I hear her voice and listen to the lyrics especially to &quot;Bring Me To Life&quot;, it reminds me of how I am with my depression waiting on that certain person waiting to bring me to life and out of the dark.  My mom and dad are probably tired of hearing the same song.  The next song they might get tired of is &quot;My Immortal&quot;.  My first time hearing it I loved the mix of the piano through-out the song, and her voice is so soothing and relaxing. They did a good job and I'm waiting to hear the other songs from them, and hope they do more and don't be a one hit wonder.

B000058T5E|5.0|A recent addition to my Jeff Beck collection (I have most of his albums). Jeff Beck is continuing his upward trajectory of recent years with an energetic, creative album. The cover art suggests the blues-y theme of most of the tunes; however, the ballad &quot;Nadia&quot; makes this acquisition worthwhile all by itself. Seems like all of his recent works have one track which will knock your socks off.<BR>Bravo!

B00008PW3O|5.0|Fleetwood Mac has gone through its trials and tribulations for many years.  The past decade saw nearly nothing with Mick Fleetwood trying to hang on to anything he could by bringing in new members and releasing mediocre material - in the form of &quot;Time&quot;, their 1995 release.<br />&quot;Say You Will&quot; not only shows that the best formula of Mac members harnesses the spirit of The Mac, but makes us want more.  This new CD is packed with treasures and rarely skips a beat.  Lindsey Buckingham brings about a uniqueness to Mac's music and brings out something that the other members don't show on their own material.  The total talent when these people get together is amazing.<br />Songs such as the traditional Mac styled &quot;Say You Will&quot;, &quot;Thrown Down&quot; and &quot;What's The World Coming To&quot; shine.  Stevie Nicks' &quot;Illume&quot; brings something new while still harnessing the ethereal spirit of her music.  Nicks also rocks on &quot;Destiny Rules&quot; and &quot;Everybody Finds Out&quot;.  Buckingham shares his guitar talents on songs like &quot;Murrow Turning Over In His Grave&quot; and &quot;Come&quot;.  Mick Fleetwood and John McVie continue their brilliance guiding the band through this assortment of musical poetry.<br />Christine McVie is sorely missed in the reuniting of some great talent, but if you were ever wondering what it would be like 30 years after Buckingham Nicks' first and only album, you are in for a treat!<br />The Mac is back!

0385504209|5.0|This book, a brilliant foray for relatively unknown author Dan Brown (though be sure to check out the Robert Langdon thriller that came before, &quot;Angels and Demons&quot;), &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot; is as engaging as it is smart. The factoids contained within the work ( the &quot;Divine Proportion&quot; being a terribly interesting example) are well-spaced and many are totally mind-boggling. They teach the reader without drawing him/her into the spiraling abyss of a pedants mind. The characters are humanly possible, quite life-like actually, and the scenes are well-described, yet still seem to stay to-the-point. I won't bore you with a long-winded summary, considering you have probably perused one in one of the previous reviews. The bottm line is that this book is a great read and should be enjoyed by all who can get their hands on it. As Poe once wrote, &quot;Quoth the Raven, read this book.&quot; (hehe)
B00005JLEU|5.0|I enjoy some Japanese animation, but I think I do a pretty good job of remaining unbiased--it's not always good just because it comes from Japan.  I must say that this is one of the most enjoyable movies I've seen in a long time.<br />The story is dream-like as it progresses; we're introduced to many memorable characters, it's heartwarming, it doesn't take itself too seriously (a pitfall of many anime films), and it's pretty to look at!  You can't ask for much more in a film.<br />A word of warning: Be prepared to suspend your disbelief.  Don't start off with the &quot;that doesn't make sense&quot; mentality.  Sure it doesn't make sense for Chihiro's (the main character) parents to walk into an abandoned amusement park and eat food hapharzardly laying on a counter.  Sure it's kinda silly for spirits and gods to be obsessed with gold (where would they spend it?).  Just go with the flow.  You'll enjoy it a lot more.

B00005JLEU|5.0|My first introduction to Spirited Away was a tape at the Chicago Comic Convention.  Having heard the hype for the film, and finding the tape for sale there, I took it home and watched it at 2 in the morning.  Well, let me say that even though the quality was off a bit, I was hooked!  I watched it probably every other day for the next month.<br />  Within a few weeks, I became the lead editor for the film at Countdown to Spirited Away on the site Countingdown.com, and soon had obtained a DVD from overseas.<br />  But wait you say, you bought an overseas copy yet you're reviewing the American DVD?  Yes I am, for I have both in my collection now.  And let me say that the work that John Lasseter and his crew did for the English dub makes it one of the best English dubs I have ever heard (eclipsing the work done for Miyazaki's film Princess Mononoke).<br />  The film is a very simple story.  Chihiro, a listless and spoiled 10-year-old girl is moving with her parents.  taking a wrong turn, they find themselves in a world of spirits where Chihiro's parents are turned into pigs.  Chihiro must brave her way through this strange world and survive, but can she return her parents to normal and find her way home?<br />  That premise is all I will say, as anymore would destroy the story.  Nowadays, there is literal fluff available for children.  i've seen parents nod off and wish the world would end before most films, but I've sat through countless showings of this film, and everytime, I've seen people enthralled by what was on that screen.  I heard no crying children, no children squirming in their seats.  I attended a sneak preview with 19 of my animation friends and they all loved it (my friend's mother has a habit of nodding off through films, but she stayed awake through all 2 hours of Spirited Away).<br />  The DVD contains the original Japanese dialogue, as well as the French and English dubs.  There are subtitles included as well as a few specials.  PIXAR studios' John Lasseter (a close personal friend to director Hayao Miyazaki) has a 2 minute opening monologue about his love for the film.<br />   There is also a segment called 'The Art of Spirited Away,' a very 'weak' segment hosted by Jason Marsden (the voice of Haku in the English dub), that explains bringing the film to the US.<br />  On the second disc, there are selected storyboards (images drawn by Miyazaki to explain the film in visual form), as well as a 50 minute special from Japanese TV that is the most in depth making of for this film you will find. Watch as the staff finds themselves under pressure, and you can see the tension building in Miyazaki's face.  There is even 30 minutes of movie trailers from Japan (while most of tehm follow a repetitive manner, it would have been nice to put in trailers from the French release and the wonderful English trailer).<br />  The disc is lacking in a few areas for features (my overseas copy has the full storyboards instead of selected storyboard sequences), but I'm just glad that the film will finally be seen by people.  After the lackluster ad campaign that Disney did for this filmback in September, the DVD release will probably prove to them that kids can go just as wild over Miyazaki's films as they do for Mickey Mouse and Winnie the Pooh.
B00008PW3Q|5.0|I have been a diehard FM fan since the White album and this has got to be the Mac's best work since Rumours.  I have been listening to it in my car, at work, and at home constantly for the last three days.  This is classic Fleetwood Mac with some new twists (&quot;Come&quot;.)  Christine McVie is definitely missed here but the extra effort of all the band members makes up for her absence.  (She does sing some backup that is easily identifiable.)  The individual talents of Stevie, Lindsay, Mick, and John multiplies when they are together.  I can't say that I have a favorite song on this release - I have many!  But probably the most powerful part of it is the last two &quot;Goodbye&quot; songs, one by Lindsay and one by Stevie.  They simply leave you breathless...and wanting for more.
B000089RVX|5.0|Wow, this has to be one of the best cd's I have bought in at least a year. Dude, if you like bring me to life then check out the rest of the cd because it just gets better.
B00008PW3Q|4.0|Forget what you saw on the TODAY show this morning, when Lindsey was up too much in the mix and Stevie too far down, and they all looked like they were freezing to death -- NBC should have known Fleetwood wouldn't be at their best, and so should we.  As for the album, let's face it, it's in the studio that this band really shines brightest; nonetheless, SAY YOU WILL is like a visit with old friends.  You sit back and let the music wash over you and it's like you're back in the summer of '75... only it's 2003 and they're older and the music's got that been-there, done-that, world-weary edge to it that seems to be permeating the newer CDs of survivors like Joe Jackson and James Taylor.  Christine's absence is felt, however, which is ultimately what prevents this thing from lifting off into the pop stratosphere.  Perhaps that's why they sounded so off this morning... oh, who knows?  It's the Mac.  Lets' enjoy 'em while we got 'em.
B00005BL2A|4.0|Yes, this is a different Depeche Mode; it does not have the immidiete impact unlike Violator. It is considerably more self-reflective and quiter. It will take many listenings to see just how naunced this album is.<br />The album does have its imperfections. The track listing, for one, is questionable. The instrumentals are also somewhat dull. However, there are some true masterpieces on this CD. Do not give up on this CD. Interestingly, I remember Music for the Masses being similarily despised after Black Celebration because of the change of direction. The change of direction is what eventually produced Violator, not that Music for the Masses was a bad CD by itself. Time will be kind to this album.

If you are an anal critic and snob of Star Trek movies and you can't enjoy the simple idea of going to a movie and having fun.  Then don't see this movie because you will dissapoint those around you with your constant criticism.  I hope Paramount continues to develop more Star Trek films and continues to make going to a movie fun.

0066214122|2.0|I have been an avid fan of Michael Crichton since reading The Andromeda Strain and The Terminal Man as a teenager.  Indeed, except for Rising Sun (which was a good read ruined by shrill polemics) and Disclosure (where the ax he had to grind was way too apparent), I have pretty much nothing but high praise for all of Mr. Crichton's novels.  I loved Sphere and I think Jurassic Park was one of my favorite reads of all time, a true page-turner.  Airframe and Timeline were excellent, too.  <br />That is why I was so disappointed in this book.  Don't get me wrong, it is still better than ninety percent of the average run-of-the-grist-mill stuff out there.  But it was weak and underdeveloped, and, as one reviewer here has already pointed out, it was not really suspenseful.  Character development was so poor that I don't think I ever really cared much about any of the main characters in the book, except for maybe the Asian scientist, May.  And as they began to die, I thought of Alien 3, where characters were introduced so sketchily that you did not care if they eventually became dogfood. <br />If you want a mildly-diverting summer read, to half glance at while you are watching humanity pass by on the beach, then by all means, pick up this book.  Better yet, wait until it comes out in paperback or borrow it from the library.  But if you have never read Michael Crichton before and are curious about his writing, please try another of his books, perhaps one of the ones I named above.  <br />Better luck next time, Mike.

0792101448|5.0|A must see. Charles Bronson, Henry Fonda. Currently voted as the number 2 western(of all time) on the international movie data base's website. The first 10 minutes sell it all, so rather than me give away the plot, watch it. Directed by Sergio Leone and composed by Ennio Morricone, it couldn't fail.
B000002549|5.0|I do remember when this originally appeared in 1976, while patiently waiting for A STAR IS BORN.  I appreciated it, and worshipped Barbra, but now I realise that it is in the top five best Barbra Albums of all time, and I enjoy it more every year as I get older.  God Bless Barbra Streisand
B00005N919|5.0|It's sad that so many people think this is just a sex flick.  True, I can't believe it got an R rating, but this movie is also SMART and HILARIOUS.  I can watch the drive to the police station 100 times and still laugh as Stone's character begins messing with Douglas's character's mind:  \\"I don't smoke.\\"  \\"Sure you do.\\"<br />The dialogue is top-notch, which in the end is what sets this film apart from so many forgettable flicks.
B00008PW3Q|2.0|I promise to listen again - but this cd is plain awful.  Could Christie McVie have been that important to overall vocal quality and musicianship?  The songs by Stevie Nicks sound like the person who wrote them has 0 ability - and although Lindsey is my absolute favorite guitar player, what the heck is he doing?<BR>I couldn't give it 1 star - but that is what it deserves.  Do not compare this with Tusk - these songs are no where near the quality.
0684852756|5.0|This slim volume is likely one of the best books I've ever read, on par with Philip Roth's \\"The Dying Animal,\\" Camus' \\"The Stranger,\\" and reflective and insightful not unlike some of Paul Auster's work, most notably his early essay, \\"The Invention of Solitude.\\"  Kureishi was attacked by outraged feminists at the time of it's original publication, but it's as honest an account of masculinity as I have ever read.  Even my wife -- normally a fan of genre fiction -- read \\"Intimacy\\" and loved it.  Throughout most of Kureishi's writing, there is a blue melancholy and a wry, self-deprecating wit. There is much of that here, but there is also anger. .....If you saw the film \\"Intimacy,\\" which was based on this book, just know the two are very different.  The film actually took from a several of his short stories....Lastly, if you're a Kureishi fan and are travelling to Europe any time soon, check out the bookstores there. There are several of his works available in English-language bookstores (especially in Paris) that are unavailable here.

B00007LL7O|3.0|Finally, the waiting is over, and here we have a highly anticipated 'Elements part 1' album that was supposed to continue to carry quality songs that Strato guys usually deliver.<BR>With the first listen I noticed a slight different approach to a formula of writing songs.  They became longer and more progressive this time around, with the exception of the introductory track 'Eagleheart' that sounds just like 'Hunting High and Low&quot; song with a different chorus.<BR>It is nice to see this change, however I think they have gone too far in that territory.  Some of their material on this album may sound too boring at times.  Still, the main problem here, I think, is a lack of magic in Stratovarius' songs. Since writing slower songs has had never been their strongest point, even faster tracks miss here some of that old magic they used to apply to either 'Black Diamond', 'No Turning Back' or 'Anthem of the World'.<BR>On the other hand, the use of an orchestra really helped to enrich their sound, and I'd like to see them continue to work in that direction.<BR>The stand out tracks are the title track, the instrumental, a beginning of 'Fantasia' and the brilliant bonus track that should have been placed some place in the middle. I hope all the issues they had here will be addressed with a release of &quot;Elements&quot; part 2.  Time will show.
B00005JMC6|4.0|Until Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings arrived on our shores movies like Whale Rider were typical of the sort of movie New Zealand has been traditionally making. Whale Rider is based on a book by well-known New Zealand author Witi Ihimaera. Set on the remote and beautiful, but impoverished East Coast of New Zealand Whale Rider deals with themes alienation and not belonging; the importance of the family; and the struggle of the Maori trying to keep one foot firmly grounded in their traditional ways but at the same time desparately trying to come to terms with the modern world. A deeply moving and uplifting movie, especially if you have empathy with the plight of indiginous people anywhere. Director Nicki Cairo has done a superb job of capturing the essence of the stunning wild scenery and it's people, Weta Workshop (of Lord of the Rings fame) have produced a pod of very realistic whales, but a standout performance of Keisha Castle-Hughes as Paikia with a supporting cast of many locally well-known actors gives this story it's real heart. This is an intelligent, uplifting movie which, at the same time, does not flinch from some of the less savoury aspects in life.
B000085RTZ|5.0|This time they really outdid themselves.<BR>It is evident that the band keeps maturing and getting better with their every new release and it pays off big time.  Huge choruses, blistering guitars, nifty interludes, passionate singing, all of it is included in this package of a pure power and I should say progressive piece of art.  A smart occasional use of female voice adds to this epic opus, so is the brilliant production.<BR>The album consists of a collection of slower and faster tracks that grab the listener entirely.  All of them really stand out, and therefore it is hard to pick the best or the worst. Song writing is top notch, that is what Kamelot is known for, but 'Epica' carries the special atmosphere that really puts it on top of their previous work.<BR>Not many albums are equal or come close to this masterpiece that is certainly among the best in business.
B00004XOWM|1.0|Forget Master of Puppets, Reign in Blood, Rust in Peace, or Chaos AD. The greatest metal album ever released is none other than Limp Bizkit's Chocolate Starfish And the Hot Dog Flavored Water. <br />With this album, Limp Bizkit did the unthinkable. They opted to do away with the speed and complexity of the aformentioned metal albums in favor of an incredible mix of repetitive drum beats and stale guitar riffs. Every true music fan knows the incredible skill it takes to play such music, as opposed to Megadeth's Hangar 18 (Which even a beginning guitar player can master in about ten minutes). And by incredible I mean that won't believe your ears. It's just that incredible. <br />Limp Bizkit, who of course knows heavy music better than any other metal band out there, also writes some of the most carefully crafted and intricate lyrics ever heard in a metal album. Most will agree that \\"Keep Rollin' Rollin' Rollin' Rollin' Rollin'!!!\\" and \\"Ain't it a shame that you can't say f...? f...'s just a word. And it's all f...ed up!.\\" are simply some of the most thoughtful and and emotional lyrics ever heard in a metal song. You see, Limp knows that true aggression is not about motivation or natural anger with people. It's about loads of profanity and happy-go-lucky vocal tones.<br />In brief, all metal fans must buy Chocolate Starfish And The Hot Dog Flavored Water. I guarantee you you'll immediately throw away your copies of Master of Puppets and Something Wicked This Way Comes after hearing this and never look back. Limp Bizkit knows what metal's all about: joyful lyrics, rap beats, and PROFANITY!!!!!
B00005JM93|5.0|This is a remarkable movie on many accounts and, unless you spooked by its 'controversy' trumpeted in the media, you oughta see it. A hint: if you appreciated 'Once Upon a Time in America' - you should be well-prepared. The hard-hitting sequence of brutal acts in the beginning of the movie is undoubtedly to make you, the viewer, suffer with the victims IRREVERSIBLY. And there is no way around it, unless you want a film about something else. The director is thoughtful enough, though, to make it reversible, at least for us, by flipping the time backwards. This film is about the oldest collisions of humanity: temptation by evil, paradise lost and suffering of innocents. It is very compassionate, even poetic, and has zero cynicism. In short, it is a moral tale told the way that makes you GET IT. A+!

B00008DDXC|5.0|This movie is as good as the book on which it's based. It's surprisingly faithful, though I wish they'd have let the audience know more about Ginny Weasley's crush on Harry Potter. It's as good as the first movie, occasionally it's even better.<br />But the reason I'm writing this review is to warn people that, though &quot;Chamber of Secrets&quot; is excellent cinema, some of it is downright scary. The spider chase scene is genuinely frightening, and moments involving a giant snake could be too much for little kids to take.<br />Watch it before you show it to younger kids. That way, you end up catching a good movie twice, and you can determine whether your kids should watch it at all.
B00000K31Q|4.0|&quot;10 Things I Hate About You&quot; is probably smarter than it has any right to be, and it's occasionally very funny. The cast is filled with winning actors, some of whom later when on to become big movie stars, and the movie plays nicely on its Shakespearean origins.<br />Regarding teen movies, isn't it funny how they're often better when they're based upon classic source material? I mean, this one, based upon &quot;Taming of the Shrew,&quot; is top-shelf entertainment, and &quot;Clueless,&quot; based on Jane Austen's &quot;Emma,&quot; is a terrific, witty movie. And the movie &quot;O,&quot; based upon &quot;Othello&quot; and featuring Julia Stiles, is an amazing, bleak drama.<br />Speaking of Stiles, she's a terrific actress, and she's the best thing about this movie.
B00005JLEU|5.0|Spirited Away is one of the greatest movies made in the last five years, and one of the greatest animated movies of all time.  Given the movie's impressive record on review-aggregator sites such as Rotten Tomatoes, I don't feel the need to reiterate what so many before me have already said (and what I've already said in reviews elsewhere).  Suffice it to say that this is a fantastic emotional roller coaster ride and a feast for the eyes and ears that is not to be missed.  Slightly scary in places, but well-suited for most kids six to seven and up, and some kids younger than that.<br />As far as the DVD is concerned, the picture is very good (mitigated only by a small glitch involving the alternate angle English language version of the title screen), the audio is excellent, and the extra features are among the best extra features ever included on an anime DVD.  Several interesting documentary clips, both English and Japanese, can be found herein, as well as an introduction by Pixar honcho John Lasseter (who also excec-produced the dub), 30 minutes of Japanese trailers, and various other things like that.<br />The original Japanese-language version is the best, of course, but the dub isn't half bad either.  Daveigh Chase does an excellent job as the movie's maturing heroine, and the supporting cast also does good work.  Haku's voice comes off as maybe a little harsh, but I can live with it.
0060278250|5.0|I was thinking of giving the book only 4 stars, simply because it just wasn't as good as its predecessors.  But looking back on Abhorsen, and rating it objectively, I find that I did enjoy it immensly, and it does earn all 5 of the coveted stars.  Abhorsen did have an entirely independent plot from both Sabriel and Lirael, but as the third book in this trilogy, I was hoping for more of a conlusion.  The beginning and middle of the book built up to an ending that could have been spectacular.  But something was lacking in the conclusion.  It didn't draw the book together and tie all the loose ends.  There was no finality to it.  I turned the last page expecting to find more words, and was met with blank white paper.  I was rather thrown off by the abrupt ending, and even now, am still speculating as to why the ending was so un-enlightening.  Readers who enjoyed Sabriel and Lirael as much as I did will probably also enjoy Abhorsen, but be aware that it is not as fulfilling a read as Sabriel and Lirael.<br />To comment on the writing, I have to say that the first few chapters sounded as if they were written by an amateur.  I FELT LIKE I WAS READING A FANFIC.  The words weren't gripping, the descriptions weren't colorful, and all in all, Nix sounded bored.  The tone of the book did pick up, though, as the story progressed, and towards the end, matched the enigmatic energy of the two previous books.  The book wasn't as put together as it could have been, and the story that finally unfolded near the end wasn't mindblowing.  But I really liked this book nonetheless, and because it is the final book of a trilogy that I love, I recommend this to anyone who has read Sabriel and/or Lirael.  But do read them in order, it makes a big difference.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|When I first saw the group on tv with their hit \\"All the things she said\\" I knew I had to get their CD. The song was already stuck in my head. Unusually, they zoomed up to my top three artists in a flash. Expecting only a few good songs, listening to them my ears filled with pleasure. There are soft songs like \\"30 minutes\\" to high powered songs like \\"How soon is now\\" orginally sung by The Smiths. Usually I hate remakes of songs and but one became one of my favorites in the CD. Some of the songs have a little bit of Russian in them like \\"Stars\\" where Julia (on the of singers in the duo) raps. And in \\"Show me Love\\" the phone call is in Russian as well. The sound is a little bit of techno and pop with a little hip hop in between. The slight accents are addicting and beautiful.
B0000033P2|5.0|Even within the genre of progressive rock, Emerson Lake &amp; Palmer have always been an acquired taste---either you like this power trio's intricate, complex arrangements &amp; show-offy musicianship, or you don't. But I, for one, have to give these guys some credit---much of ELP's music is very strong &amp; powerful, indeed. Keyboardist extraordinaire Keith Emerson, singer/guitarist/bassist Greg Lake, and drummer Carl Palmer are all tremendous musicians (with Lake sporting one of the great, commanding voices in all of rock, besides), and when put together in a recording studio or on a stage, these guys are a mighty three-piece rock orchestra.ELP's third album, 1972's &quot;Trilogy,&quot; is also their best. Keith, Greg, and Carl really sound like a well-oiled machine on this one. The great dramatic shifts of &quot;The Endless Enigma&quot; are awesome. Greg Lake's &quot;From The Beginning&quot; is a brilliant acoustic masterpiece (and arguably my favorite ELP song, bar none). &quot;The Sheriff&quot; is terrific Wild West fun, and the kinetic &quot;Hoedown&quot; is another great ELP staple. The title track is an amazing piece (love that exuberant instrumental section, too), &quot;Living Sin&quot;  is a strong, steady rocker (with Lake's deliciously demonic voice sounding like a creature rising from the tarpits), and finally, &quot;Abaddon's Bolero&quot; is an excellent march that builds &amp; builds to a great climax---you can just imagine some armor-clad army going off to battle with this one. And &quot;Trilogy&quot; is also the best-sounding album from ELP, the group's production work here sounding as sharp as a knife.Emerson Lake &amp; Palmer's &quot;Trilogy&quot; is the band's strongest album, with every single track on it a bonafide winner. They have other great albums, of course: &quot;Emerson Lake &amp; Palmer,&quot; &quot;Tarkus,&quot; &quot;Brain Salad Surgery,&quot; etc., but for me, ELP's brand of art-rock works to maximum effect on this one. &quot;Trilogy&quot; is Keith, Greg, and Carl at the peak of their powers.
B000002H48|5.0|This is from back in the day before celebrities got bashed and labeled un-American for making political statements.  While by no means depicting the entire show, it's not a bad collection of 70s rock stars, many of whom are still popular and making great music today.  For many years (too many) this was the only official source of live Springsteen on record, and still the only place you can find the Detroit Medley (\\"Devil With A Blue Dress/CC Rider/Good Golly Miss Molly\\").  This song has been popping up recently in Bruce's setlist, and I don't believe it's too different from the rendition heard here.  Bruce's duet with Jackson Browne on \\"Stay\\" also makes it worthwhile- you don't often get to hear Bruce with another artist on record.  James Taylor, Tom Petty, Bonnie Raitt, The Doobies- all also make excellent contributions and will be sure to please fans of those artists.
B000002KBA|5.0|This is a must have album (CD) for any Deep Purple, rockn'roll, or guitar fan. Even after all these years it hardly sounds dated. The musicianship and composition are second to none. This was one of those albums that made people sit up an notice this band...and of course Machine Head came along..and the rest is history. You can hear the influence this album had on other musicians/bands at the time and those that came after. If you are dissapointed with this CD I suggest you may be a country music fan..not that there's anything wrong with that!
0671042858|4.0|I'm not normally a fan of Stephen King - I'll admit it, I'm too wussy for the level of creepiness he can achieve.  But a friend told me I had to read this one and in a weak moment I bought it.  I was glad I did.  It wasn't what I'm used to from other books like IT and Carrie but I loved the story.  Our young Trisha gets lost in the woods during a family outing.  During her time wandering in the woods, she is starving and tired and eventually starts to hallucinate but keeps going as she tries to find her way out of the woods.<br />It was a great book with good flow, I was never bored.  My only 'negative' comment would be that it was not long enough.<br />Fan or not, pick this one up!
B000002WYT|1.0|Great writing.  Great musicianship.  Nice band chemistry.  Horrible vocals.  The Dave Matthews Band would be great, if only Dave would keep his mouth shut and hire a vocalist.

B000002HEP|5.0|Perhaps no band mastered sludgy, desert-style rock like Kyuss, and \\"Welcome To Sky Valley\\" may well be the best evidence of that fact. Everything just came together for them on this album: epic songwriting, infectious grooves, and killer instrumental chops. While there are definite nods here to Black Sabbath and Led Zeppelin, Kyuss transcended their influences to create a unique sound that's just a sheer blast to listen to. While this album's predecessor \\"Blues For The Red Sun\\" has generated a bit more acclaim, if you want to get into Kyuss I suggest you start here.<br />With the exception of the brief (but funny) closer \\"Whitewater,\\" \\"Welcome To Sky Valley\\" is composed of a mere three tracks, each topping fourteen minutes and subdivided into three sections. In other words, the beginnings and ends of the tracks are pretty much arbitrary. They do have one common denominator, though: they all rule. Each one is rich in experimentation and variety, encompassing hard-driving metal, trippy extended jams, and even some gentle acoustic passages.<br />What really elevated Kyuss to the top of the stoner/desert rock heap was the stunning virtuosity of the musicians, especially guitarist Josh Homme. I love Queens of the Stone Age, but I had no idea how good a guitarist Josh was until I started listening to Kyuss. His work with this band really is like nothing else I've ever heard. His riffs are often crushingly heavy, but they're also some of the most catchy and memorable in all of rock, and his leads are just as good. Brant Bjork's drumming is every bit as impressively technical as on \\"Blues For The Red Sun,\\" and Scott Reeder's bass mirrors the guitars perfectly to add some extra heaviness. And John Garcia's wailed, gravelly vocals are the perfect complement to the band's sound. What's more, the production is absolutely perfect, allowing you to hear every nuance of the music without abandoning the fuzzy stoner vibe that's so essential in the genre.<br />So anyway, rock fans of all stripes can't go wrong with Kyuss. With boring, wimpy Seattle-lite and nu-metal bands clogging the airwaves, bands like this one are a useful reminder of what rock music is supposed to be. So if you don't already own it, pick up \\"Welcome To Sky Valley\\" today. And while you're at it, grab \\"Blues For The Red Sun.\\" Oh, and their farewell \\"...And The Circus Leaves Town\\" is good too. So just get all three.of all stripes can't go wrong with Kyuss.

B00006RIO7|5.0|I lived in NYC and I've seen hundreds of Broadway shows and musicals.  Chicago is the only movie version I have ever seen that musically and visually ever made me think I was veiwing this live on the Big White Way!  Catherine Zeta-Jones is very good--sings and dances to a trice--did she deserve the Best Supporting actress award, no.  Renee Zellwegger,as Roxie, may not sing or dance QUITE as well as Jones was PERFECT as Roxie; in my opinion was underestimated for the Best Actress award.  Queen Latifah was &quot;it&quot; as Momma and certainly deserved her nomination.  John C. Reilly, while holding a smaller part sang &quot;Mr. Cellophane&quot; as no one in my memory could. He sang with just the right amount of pride and pathos.  If only his acting were as good.  Richard Gere--who knew he could sing--at all. His dancing isn't he Gene Kelly  or Fred Astaire but  was not bad.  All-in-all, he was surprizingly good at both and good in the part.  I certainly would never have cast him without an audition.  All in all this sound track is magnificent and deserves a place in anyone's collection of show tunes. If you like musicals and haven't seen it DO!  You'll run to get the sound track (and maybe the movie--when released nationally).
068484267X|4.0|Almost everyone who's read Angela's Ashes praises it as one of the best autobiographies/memoirs ever - a statement I would hesitate to agree with. Dont get me wrong: I do think it's a very good book. The best thing about Angel's Ashes is its lack of sorrowfulness - you dont see an author sobbing over a painful childhood and asking for your sympathy. Instead it's treated with great humor (this book does have some of the funniest passages you'd read in a serious autobiographies) and a lack of egoism. The narrator describes things for what they are and show a geniune interests in the psychologies of others. Even when it comes to an unsympathetic character, the protrait is drawn with great understanding and warmth. The oceanic existence of the child is particularly well-done, with great immediacy, that we get drawn into his universe in great sympathy. These are among the greatest achievements an autobiographer can have. <BR>The only thing I am uncomfortable with is the ending. It's a very deliberate construction of McCourt 'giving up' Ireland (symbolized by the Priest) for U.S. and its values (think of the woman who grabs him - and the affirmative answer he gives to the question: isn't America wonderful?). The book ends well - but I can't get rid of the feeling that it is a bit too 'market-oriented', which undermines the previous narrative a little bit when you go back to read it again.

B00006CXSS|5.0|No doubt the story and its execution have been reviewed already, so...I've seen this series advertised on TV when it was just airing (I don't have HBO), and then forgot about it until about a month ago when we saw it in the store. Almost didn't buy it (It's pretty expensive), but rationalized the purchase somehow-- as much as you can do, walking out of the video store with a tin can full of DVD's. I gotta agree with a previous reviewer that this is one of the best purchases of this kind that we've made. It's that good. At the end you'll know each soldier by name.

0440211727|4.0|A Time To Kill, John Grisham's first novel, is a remarkably compelling, bold, fearless, lofty achievement for a new writer.  While the book was picked up and published in small numbers at first, it was not until The Firm placed Grisham squarely on the map that this earlier effort was republished and made available for the masses of his new fans.  What impresses me most about A Time To Kill is the way in which Grisham grabs your attention and sucks you right into the story immediately every time you pick it up; my interest and fascination was retained throughout the whole 500+ pages.  I'm generally not a fan of lawyer or police novels, but the criminal events forming the crux of this novel are visceral right from the start, as little 10-year old Tonya Hailey, a black girl, is brutally raped and assaulted by two cruel white men.  Grisham doesn't wait around to throw his best stuff directly at the reader.  The two men are arrested and put on trial, but Carl Lee Hailey, Tonya's father, gets hold of an M-16 and blows both guys away (along with a deputy's lower leg) in the very halls of the courthouse.  Jake Brigance, our protagonist, is determined to get his new client acquitted, a very tough task when everyone knows how the man planned and carried out the murders in cold blood.  Naturally, some folks think Carl Lee should be declared a hero for what he did, while others argue that vigilante justice cannot be permitted.  Since a black man killed two white men for raping his black daughter, race quickly becomes the big tent under which a legal and social circus is performed in the small town of Clanton, Mississippi.  The black churches organize to support Carl Lee, calling in the NAACP and urging blacks from all over that part of the state to come to the courthouse demanding Carl Lee's release.  The defunct Klan reemerges in the town and goes well beyond simple intimidation of jurors and Jake Brigance himself.  Needless to say, there is a lot of human drama contained in these pages.<br />As eminently readable as this novel is, though, a few things about it bother me enough for me to take away one star from my rating.  The action is just not real enough.  Carl Lee is given unimaginable privileges by the black sheriff while being held in jail, for one thing.  The most prominent black preacher in the county has a number of sinful ways about him.  The judges seem to behave inappropriately at times, and some of the antics of Jake and the D.A. during the trial provide sources of humor that seem inappropriate.  As for Jack, I found it impossible to ever really like the man.  All he cares about is keeping this client and getting all the publicity for defending this man before the eyes of the nation.  He tells his wife he will drop the case if it looks like he or his family is in danger, but that is pledge is proven quite false.  He is rather unethical at times, proves himself to be less than careful in his trial preparation, and he spends the better part of the crucial days drinking like a fish.  John Grisham says there is a lot of himself in Jake Brigance, and maybe all lawyers really are as superficial as the protagonist, but I hope that is not the case.<br />As compelling a read as this book is, much of its fate naturally hinges on its conclusion.  Will Carl Lee be freed or sentenced to death?  I can accept the climax of these events as it is written, but it does feel somewhat rushed.  After oftentimes slowly and carefully picking over every bit of action and dialogue, things just happen too quickly in the end.  The judgment of the case also belies events in the courtroom, and one main character is all but forgotten at the end.  No first novel should be perfect, and this one certainly isn't, but it is nevertheless one of the most amazing first novels I have read from an author.  Grisham keeps your hands glued to the pages from start to finish.hese pages.<br />As eminently readable as this novel is, though, a few things about it bother me enough for me to take away one star from my rating.

B00006BTCA|5.0|I initially was a little skeptical approaching Interpol due to the overload of hype and the fact that their older material was a little too reminiscent of Joy Division. But Turn On The Bright Lights shows Interpol finding their own sound, and it works beautifully. The band has gotten too many comparisons to Joy Division, and while their pre-Bright Lights material does perhaps \\"rip-off\\" Joy Division to an extent, Bright Lights' material is sounds much \\"warmer\\" and the dual-guitar interplay brings a different aspect to the sound. Turn On The Bright Lights has one of the best opening line-ups of songs with \\"Obstacle 1,\\" \\"NYC,\\" \\"PDA,\\" and \\"Say Hello To Angels\\" offering a constant stream of dark, moody atmospheres, and striking lyricism. The gorgeous \\"Hands Away\\" is a stunning change of pace while \\"Stella Is A Diver...\\" is probably the second half's highlight. Interpol is one band that is deserving of all the hype they've received, and Turn On The Bright Lights was easily in my Top Ten of 2002.
B00003CXI1|4.0|If your read the books, you will not be let down by this movie.  So often the books and movies have little more than the title and main character names in common.  This is NOT one of them.  The story of an orphaned boy who discovers that he is a wizard is well told in this movie.  A word of caution: this is about an 11 year old boy.  Some of the situations frighten him and rightfully so.  As such, I do not recommend little ones to watch this one alone.  <BR>The only aspect of the DVD that I didn't care for was how difficult it was to get to the deleted scenes.  Normally, you choose to watch the scenes from a menu.  On this DVD you must complete a series of challenges to get to the scenes.  One challenge in particular is unreasonably difficult.  To solve the puzzle you must either guess well or have read the book MANY times.  I liked the idea of a challenge, but the answers should have been somewhere in the movie.
0151008116|3.0|Before I say anything else I should say that this &quot;Life Of Pi&quot; is at times an imaginative and compelling story.  However, I only gave it three stars because the presentation is at times very uneven.  Yann Martel is a promising writer but he too often settles for obvious observations.  He is not a great prose stylist either; his sentences are often awkward and stilted.  At times I found it difficult to focus on the story because Martel obviously didn't have control of the language.  The narrative structure he uses is also somewhat problematic.  Martel isn't able to consistently tell the story in his narrator's voice (like, say, Dickens) or let it fade into the background altogether.  The result is an narrator that hardly resembles the external character.  At times this book reminded me of Marquez , at times Melville, but it really didn't measure up to either.  I got very little sense of this book as a whole.  There really seemed to only be a couple different only coincidentally related stories.  That being said, this book is worth reading.  It has a lovely--if somewhat simplistic--ending and it can easily be read in a day.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|For anyone who has never seen this movie, see it on this DVD.  If you've already seen it, see it again on DVD. I got this DVD as a birthday present, and I have seen it many times since.  The special features are phenominal.  The new scene is inserted so well that you would think it was always a part of the movie.   The soundtrack is full of catchy fun to sing songs.  The story is well told, the voice cast is well chosen, and the movie flows well. Disney did a class A job with this one.
B00008H2LB|5.0|Linkin Park has done it again. I have been a fan ever since i heard One Step Closer. I thought Hybrid Theroy was one of the best rock records id heard in a long time. But imagaine my suprise when i heard the first notes of there new record Meteora-theyd done it again. Crafting great songs with hooks that you sing over and over again never getting tired of them. Theyve just cemented their place in music history with this new cd. If you werent a fan of Linkin Park before one listen to this cd and youll become one. Excellent. You wont be left hanging.
B000001FBQ|1.0|This is where Kiss started to get silly and the money making machine that previously was a slightly dangerous rock 'n roll band was in full force.   Back in the mid-seventies I was a full blown Kiss maniac. I loved Alive (still do), Destroyer and Rock 'n Roll Over. But this is the last album that stopped me from listening to Kiss.   Except for the title song which is just above average, this album is sub-par. All of the songs are weak. Christine Sixteen which was the first single off the album is positively dreadful. This song is pop not rock 'n roll and not even good pop!!   The album also suffers from overblown production. The vocals are mixed to death and must have been overdubbed upteen times. Before this album Ace lead guitar was solid and sometimes great. On this album the lead guitar solos just kind of lay there, which is partly because of the overblown production.   I know this sounds negative, but I am just venting because I still remember being very dissapointed with this album, whereas before I was a Kiss maniac.   Do yourself a favor and skip this one.
B00008H2LB|4.0|I hope in the next album,it would be longer like an hour.If LP wants to be a reconized band,they need to expand their lenths of their songs.But this is still a good album,the best track is faint.
B00008S2VG|5.0|I was a little pessimistic about this album at first (due to the rap on the single \\"American Life\\"), but then when i got the chance to listen to the album preview in mtv.com, i was completely blown away! It's quite different from all the things she's done before but just the same it somewhat picked up where the album \\"Music\\" left off and a lot better! Never a dull moment, all the songs have a strong potential to hit not one song is just a filler. I can't wait to get hold of my own copy!
B000084T18|4.0|50 Cent did great on this album. Em and DRE also did well on producing.I don't know why people are saying he can't rap,he has the hottest flow lately.The best tracks are patiently waiting, many men,high all the time,heat,if i cant,back down,21 questions,gotta make it to heaven,and u not like me.I hope fiddy will be more consistent the next time he releases his next album...
B000000W5L|5.0|During recording sessions for Bridges to Babylon, session musician Blondie Champlin thought he had hit a wrong note.  Keith Richards responded, \\"That wasn't a mistake.  That was innovation.\\" <br />Richards always understood the value of spontaneity and taking what seemd to be errors and transforming them into strengths.  Like many jazz albums of the '50s, Exile on Main Street is a grand testament to this philosophy.<br />Recorded in the midst of becoming tax exiles from their native England and moving abroad to France would have been enough duress and distraction enough for most, but then the Stones chose to record in the guitarists basement - where the humidity was nearly-unbearable (and caused the instruments to quickly go out of tune), power was stolen from France's electical system, and dinner was routinely served for a table of 30 - well, come on, when a scenario half this crazy emerges for most, it's be expected that the results won't be near their best.  Oh, and then there's also the little matter of the lead singer running off every available minute to be with his pregnant newly-wed wife and the aforementioned guitarist busy with his children and his massive heroin habit.<br />So what do the Stones do amid all this chaos?  Only augment their line-up to include horns and transform themselves into one of the hottest R&B outfits ever. (R&B not in the tradition of, say, the Commodores, but Stax/Volt and the likes of Joe Tex).<br />And the album is so LOOSE.  The production is muddy, Mick's vocals are their most slurred and decadent, the songwriting covers an enormously broad spectrum - from rock, blues, country, soul, and even gospel: if you'd taken one element out of this equatin, it would have all collapsed.  Moreso than any individual highlight, Exile's appeal is its' atmosphere and the energy and world it sucks the listener into.<br />So what are the highlights?  ALL of it.  From the songs and performances themselves to individual moments.  The sleaze of Rocks Off and Turd on the Run, the break-neck tempo of Rip This Joint, the build of the coda on Tumblin' Dice, the desperatate, affectionate lyrics on Torn and Frayed and Shine a Light, the menace of Ventillator Blues and Casino Boogie, Mick Taylor's solos on All Down the Line, Mick's vocals on Let It Loose and Swewet Black Angel, Keith's on Happy, Mick's harp solo on Stop Breaking Down, the horns on Loving Cup, it goes on and on.<br />Englishmen livng in France expressing their love and obsession with American music in a dingy basement while depending on Jack Daniels to fend off the humidity to get that last bit of vocals recorded.  There's no reason in the world it should have worked.  It sounds like a formula for total disaster.  But somehow - as only Keith and the Stones could make it - it did.  Gloriously.
B0000028M7|5.0|\\"Dirt\\" was allegedly done while some of the group's members were wrestling with drug problems.  I don't know if this was the case or not, but the songs and the intense music sure sound like the guys were working something out.  In due time they did fine, though later Layne Staley got into some trouble.  His partners in music are doing pretty well.<br />The late Layne Staley's voice balances very nicely with the rest of the band's musicianship, especially that of Jerry Cantrell.  I certainly don't get the idea that Alice in Chains was trying to make popular music but they were certainly making great music.  <br />If you are interested in this somewhat dormant genre of music \\"Dirt\\" is a fine addition to your collection.
B00008973Q|5.0|This is the DVD that many Kurosawa fans have been waiting years for and it doesn't disappoint.  The film is beautiful.  The commentaries are great.  Overall, I have only one complaint about the DVD:  in the trailers section, the two trailers included are the European and Home video trailers.  They're good, but I would much rather have had the original Japaneese and American trailers and maybe the re-release trailer from 2000.<br />Overall, I highly recommend this DVD to any film buff.  Excellent.  I can only hope that more of Kurosawa's films are re-released in such a manner on DVD.
B00008PW3O|4.0|Very good CD.  I did not realize how much I would miss Christine McVie, but still a very good CD.  Reminiscent of Tango In The Night, but with more of a synthetic sound.  Voices still sound great and instrumentation is tight.  Christine and Sheryl Crow somehow contribute, but it isn't made clear how.  Definitely worth buying the enhanced CD.
B000002J09|5.0|Led Zeppelin 4 is diffently the rock n roll masterpiece many that many people clam it to be.First of all each of the songs are first rate.There are no duds on this album.&quot;Black Dog&quot; is an awesome opener,and the follow up &quot;Rock and Roll&quot; is great too.The real masterpeice of the album is &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot; which was never released as a single.If you're looking to buy a Zeppelin album this should be the one you get.I recommend this over their greatest hits albums.All the songs are good.
0312305060|2.0|I just finished reading The Hours and I found it very depressing.<BR>Also, What was the PLOT?? Women are depressed  and they sometimes commit suicide? I am sorry but I did not like this book.I admit it is beautifully written, but it fails to entertain. A really gook book, not as well written, but one I liked more was \\"Sing Me A Bawdy Song.\\"
B000002JS6|5.0|Back in Black is AC/DC's high point of their career.Although it was released shortly after the death of Bon Scott,I guess the fans were willing to accept Brian Johnson.This was their most popular album.Back in Black open with the classic \\"Hells Bells\\" and doesn't stop rocking until the end.Everything in between \\"Hells Bells\\" and Rock and Roll ain't noise pollution\\" is great.If you like rock n roll this is a must have.
B00008973A|3.0|The three stars are all for the feature, the drama and tragedy found in a day-long audition for a Broadway chorus line, as enjoyable as ever.<br /><br />The DVD presentation of A CHORUS LINE, however, is only adequate. The widescreen video transfer is good, but the English stereo surround audio is only a minor step up from VHS. Keeping a good sound level is difficult; tune the volume up loud enough to hear dialogue subtleties and the songs crack the plaster. Stereo is used throughout, but the only noticeable surround use is (the MGM lion) Leo's roar at the onset. A failing of many MGM DVD releases, sadly, and not unique to A CHORUS LINE.<br /><br />On the plus side, English, French, and Spanish subtitles are offered, along with the original trailer and an enjoyable but brief \\"stage to screen\\" featurette of Marvin Hamlish on his contributions to A CHORUS LINE.<br /><br />Overall, an adequate presentation, with the DVD leaving the impression it could have been so much more considering the noteworthiness of the feature.
B00004LN16|1.0|I'm an AC/DC fan,but I must say that &quot;Stiff Upper Lip&quot; ranks among one of the worst albums I have ever heard.Most of the songs have the AC/DC sound,but none of them have anything special that makes them stand out,basically it's all filler,the songs are bland.I think their starting to have the same trouble they had from 81-91 not writing very strong material.
B00007GZQZ|5.0|A Great comedy! Funny, Furious, and Fracturing! Who knew something with Steven Spielburg's name attached could be so Great? Tom Hanks and Shelly Long are fantastic together as a frazzled couple trying to live the american dream with the world seemingly against them! But don't worry It will all come together in about two weeks! the widescreen DVD is Finally available for everyone to enjoy!
B000084T18|2.0|Well, another underground legend has been ruined.  50 used to be cool, before everyone and their brother listened to him.  This cd is pretty much mindless dribble, sounding exactly like all the other rappers MTV loves.  Heat's a good song and so is Wanksta.  The 3 bonus tracks are the best but they should have included How To Rob.

B00008DDXC|5.0|Some people have argued that this movie was scary. I don't recommend it for children under 7 because of the implications of \\"blood, kill\\" and so on. However, this movie addresses such issues like racism and making choices. I advise people to just watch this movie for fun. Try not to make a religion out of it because its only for pure entertainment.
B00000ILDE|5.0|Aliens is, arguably, the best film of its genre. James Cameron, an expert at arranging kinetic action scenes, wrote and directed this film, which was his finest effort. Aliens features gloriously staged battles, highly imaginative gadgetry, vivid characters who were well-cast, and Sigourney Weaver in her most compelling performance as Ripley.<br />  Though surpassing Ridley Scott's fine Alien, as well as all other genre rivals, Aliens was produced on a remarkably small budget.<br />  The Director's Cut features 17 minutes of exposition and gadgetry that fans of this film will love. New viewers should watch the tighter original cut however.

B00008J2DQ|1.0|This album [is bad]. It sounds exactly like their previous efforts. They did not change their formula or anything. Not one memorable riff or chorus or verse except for the song they did for The Mummy soundtrack and the final acoustic ballad piece which is the only strong song on the album in my opinion. I can't believe people like this boring drivle that Godsmack passes off as good music. Utter disappointemnt.
B000002NAK|5.0|This film and soundtrack are absolutely amazing! Madonna is amazing as the rising star Eva Peron from her restless days in youth to her last words holding tightly the hand of Juan Peron. Johnathan Pryce is an amazing Peron and it's wonderful to know he has had American exposure, being a wonderful actor in the West End. The music by Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice are addictive and wonderful. Also a small note, the lead singer to the well known band &quot;The Corrs&quot; Andrea Corr has a small part in this film as one of Peron's flames.
B00008PW3Q|2.0|Christine Mcvie is missing something badly on this set.while I think&Feel Lindsey Buckingham is a Very Talented Musician the direction here just doesn't fit the overall Fleetwood Mac Style&Vibe at there best.Stevie Nicks is cool still but the songwriting&overall arrangements&direction is lacking heart&depth for me.
B00008PX8P|5.0|Sorry for this not so helpful review but I gotta put my 2 cents in.<BR>All Zeppelin fans are sure to agree its a must have.<BR>To have all this live footage from the not so publicized Led Zeppelin is quite a treat.<BR>I love the fact that \\"my band\\" made it so big without any real publicity.  That's because they didn't need to.  And if they need build up some hype now, its ok with me.<BR>So no matter what the review all Zep fans (and by the way anybody who's into music should me a Zep fan) know this is a no brainer........get it!
0385507755|1.0|I was going to buy this book based on some critical praise I've heard rumbling around in various newspapers and magazines, but after reading interviews with the author, I am not so sure.  He seems to confuse masculinity with megolmania.  If he was such a great writer and such a &quot;man&quot; why does he have to mouth off like a 17 year old High School football jock in interviews?  Anyone that has confidence in the quality of their work would be fine letting the work speak for itself, but James Frey is obviously more than a little lacking in self-esteem.  I have a feeling when the &quot;greatest writer&quot; of my generation comes around (I'm 28), he won't be announcing it over a loudspeaker in the media.  He'll quietly go about creating great work, and will be rewarded.
B00005YW4H|5.0|I have so much respect for Norah Jones.  A long time ago, before anyone had really ever even heard of her, I had the television on and was working, when all of a sudden her video came on and I was mesmerized by her soft, smoky voice and soothing melodies.  She is calming and relaxing, yet at the same time she produces a fresh energy that is vibrant and very much her own.  In today's music world, it is near impossible to find a female singer who has a sound all her own, and a sound that is pleasantly different in a sea of Barbie-doll blondes.  Although I wanted the whole world to know about this talented young woman, I didn't want her to turn into a media voodoo doll who would be overexposed and processed.  When I saw that she had won 8 Grammys, however, 5 of them her very own, I was estatic. She deserves every single one of them.  I soon realized that no amount of fame could faze her, blind her, or warp her into something different from what she was.  Norah Jones is an amazing singer, she has an amazing team of songwriters and musicians, and she has an amazing album.  Not only is she extremely talented, but she is humble, kind, and selfless as well.  I hope the best for her and I will continue to listen to her album religiously and root her on.
0156421178|5.0|The best way that I can think of to describe George Orwell is a skeptical and responsible idealist, obsessed with the nature of, uses and abuses of power.  Generally unacknowledged about Orwell was the fact that he was a committed socialist and a man who believed that human beings were capable of creating a society where a brotherhood of man based on social justice could exist.  <br />In 1936 he went to Spain and saw in Catalonia, and more specifically Barcelona, and felt that he was witness to a society that existed on that basis-in his own words, he \\"recognized it as a state of affairs worth fighting for.\\"  Over the next several months, while he fought for the Spanish republic side by side with workers in the militia of the radical POUM, he saw it destroyed and libeled by the republic he came to defend and, more specifically, the Spanish Communist Party and its lackeys throughout the world.  His story is exactly what the title proclaims it to be: homage to the men and women who had fought, very literally for freedom and social justice, and the society that existed on those principles that he saw destroyed.  Like any good journalist as well, he wants to set the record straight about a very misunderstood state of affairs.<br />Part soldiering memoir, with what seems to be the obligatory British emphasis on the surreality and physical deprivation of the trenches, and part recitation of the little known suppression of anarchists and radical socialists in the midst of the general war against Franco, Orwell is able to show the spirit that animated the thousands of foreign volunteers that went to fight for the republic, and how they were all betrayed.  The nature of the betrayal was made even worse by the fact that it was committed in a libelous fashion that did not allow most to even know that it had occurred.  Orwell did not go to Spain looking to expose anyone on the republican side of the war as a villain, but by the time he left in July of 1937, he knew with a goodamount of certainty that the Soviet Union was as great an enemy of democracy as any fascist could be-a very foreign idea in left-wing thought at the time.<br />Through the cataloging of his own experiences in Barcelona during the suppression of the POUM and anarchists in early 1937 and comparing them with the accounts of left-wing and Communist newspapers from in and outside of Great Britain, Orwell concluded that a massive campaign of disinformation concerning the suppression of anti-Communist radicals in Catalonia.  Disturbing enough was the fact that it was happening and that Communists were lying about it.  Orwell knew that the Communist Party press had a tendency to lie, but what was much more disturbing was how the more mainstream liberal and left opinion makers were accepting hook, line and sinker the stories of the perfidy of anti-Communists that were coming exclusively from Communists and their allies.  He saw an inexcusable mixture of gullibility and laziness animating the reportage of the war there.<br />The disinformation that he records was terrible enough, but this was not where the true horror and betrayal laid.  Hundreds of defenders of the republic, including foreigners that Orwell knew personally had sacrificed much to fight there, were being thrown in jail and the government of Spain was utterly powerless to stop it.  Orwell shows something of a Communist state within a state that operated outside the power of the government.  He concludes that it was because the Spanish republic had to depend on the Soviet government for its military support.  This lamentable situation is the fault not of the republican government, men of goodwill and honestly mostly, but by the fact that no countries other than the Soviet Union, and to a small degree Mexico, were helping the republic in the fight for its life.  The confrontation against Franco's fascism was being undermined because the powers that were running the war were declaring the most militant of the antifascists to be de facto traitors.  If there were ever an abuse of power, coupled with a colossal abuse of the truth, the suppression of the POUM and its allies was it.<br />As an historical document, \\"Homage to Catalonia\\" is a necessary to any understanding of the tragedy of the Spanish Civil War.  The villainous and parasitical treatment of the Spanish Republic by the Soviet Union that has recently come to light was dimly perceived decades by Orwell decades before the documentation proving Soviet perfidy came out of Russian archives.  It is also necessary reading to gain a deeper understanding of Orwell's masterwork \\"1984.\\"  If there any wonder as to how he could so vividly imagine a totalitarian society without ever having lived in one, it becomes clear that he had some help from the utterly preposterous situation he found himself in during the suppression of the POUM and anarchists in Catalonia.  Finally, the level of honesty and sincerity with which he tells his story is total and completely without pretension and propaganda.  Orwell was loyal to truth and basic goodness-values that are still in short supply today.
B0000039QA|5.0|Well what can i say ...biggie went crazy crazy on this album. Weather you agree with me or not, I think this is his 2nd best. LIFE AFTER DEATH's finest moments are instantly catchy. I almost broke my neck listening to this to this album (i noded my head to much). Biggie's flow,lyrics and beats are hot. It doesnt matter if puffy sampled other songs onto this album...What matters is if the songs are hot. I think that this album is better that ALL EYEZ ON ME from tupac even though that album was hot. From the start to end this is truly a classic from the king of new york. If you dont have it then buy it. Its worth your money and you wont be dissapointed<br />R.i.p. Biggie & tupac
B00005QGAT|5.0|Michael Jackson is one of the most successful, famous and influential music artists in history. His music is among some of the best ever recorded and his debut album represents a large part of this. \\"Off The Wall\\" was Michael's debut album and was released in 1979. He was already a huge star as the lead singer of the Jacksons, but this debut album introduced the world to the adult Michael. He was willing to leave the band that made him famous behind and pursue a solo career. This is where it began.<br /><br />Off The Wall begins with the classic \\"Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough.\\" Released in September 1979, the song was a massive US No.1 and peaked at No.3 in the UK. The beat is strong, and Michael's vocals are very high-pitched in their iconic style. The song has many instrumental styles, but the focus is on the incredible vocal arrangement. At just over six minutes long, the song is a classic in every sense of the word. \\"Rock With You\\" was released in February 1980 and was another US No.1. The beat on this song is great and Michael's vocals are very strong. The trumpet that signals after Michael sings \\"I wanna rock with you\\" is deeply classy and the eerie instrumental is pure disco fun. \\"Workin' Day And Night\\" is perhaps the most uptempo song on this album, and it works very well. The beat is rather muddled, even a little tribal. The verses are speedy, as is the chorus, and Michael has many of his famous noises going on, such as the \\"Ow!\\"<br /><br />\\"Get On The Floor\\" is my favourite unreleased song from this album. This song is pure pop disco fun. The beat is brash and loud, along with an echoing feel to it, which makes Michael's vocals stand out a lot more. Michael adds lots of chanting after three minutes which adds to the crazy feel to the song. The album's title track, \\"Off The Wall\\" is the worst song on the album, yet it's still a great song. Released in November 1979, the song has a very strange beginning before breaking out with a funky beat and clap. Michael's vocals are excellent and not only showcase his talent, but cement the fact that his vocal range can vary dramatically throughout a song. The verses showcase his deep manly vocals while the choruses show his high-pitched voice. \\"Girlfriend\\" is the brilliant song written by Paul McCartney. The song is very sweet and innocent. Michael takes time between his singing in the verses and one begins to wonder just where he's taking it. \\"Girlfriend...I'm gonna tell your boyfriend...Tell him...Exactly what we're doin'...Tell him what you do to me...Late at night when the wind is free...Girlfriend...I'm gonna show your boyfriend...Show him...The letters I've been saving.\\" Get the picture?<br /><br />\\"She's Out Of My Life\\" is one of the highlights on this album. While a short song at just over three and a half minutes, this deeply emotional ballad makes a big impact. Released in May 1980, the song peaked at No.3 in the UK. Michael's vocals are the strongest on the album on this particular song. Michael fills the lyrics with rich emotion. This is only enhanced when he sings the tear-jerking last word of the song; \\"life.\\" \\"I Can't Help It\\" is a pure funky pop song with soulful tones that make it an ultimate album highlight. The song has some excellent beats and the chorus is particularly memorable. The song is perfect for chilling to or dancing to slowly. \\"It's The Falling In Love\\" is a great mid-tempo ballad with great vocals and a brilliant chorus that captures everything that this album is about; funky beats, innocent lyrics and strong vocals. The song also features guest vocals from Patti Austin. \\"Burn This Disco Out\\" is an excellent song to finish this classic album. The song begins with a stylish introduction on the trumpet, as Michael begins his singing. The vocals are strong, and the lyrics represent good times and are very trouble-free.<br /><br />OVERALL GRADE: 10/10<br /><br />This special re-marstered edition of Off The Wall contains some excellent bonus features.Included are interviews with producer Quincy Jones, and songwriter Rod Temperton. These are particularly insightful, and we also get the bonus original demo versions of Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough and Workin' Day And Night on which Michael's younger sister Janet plays instruments. These bonus features are excellent and add to the album's quality. In conclusion, Off The Wall may not be Michael Jackson's best album, but it is definitely the one which brings back the fondest memories. This album is literally off the wall.Quincy Jones, and songwriter Rod Temperton.

B000001GPX|5.0|This is a wonderful recording.  The sound quality is very good for a 1970's recording.  One of the reviewers has mentioned Karajan's recordings of these symphonies.  I am a huge fan of Karajan and his recordings are to me the gold standard.  This recording is, in my opinion, just as good as Karajan's recordings.  It has a refreshingly different approach.  Karajan's recordings are like oil paintings.  They have very solid and rich sounds.  Abbado's recent recordings are water colour paintings.  They have wonderful transparent, airy qualities.  I would put Kleiber's recordings in between Karajan's and Abbado's recording.  This one has the virtues of both recordings.
0151008116|4.0|Pi is a boy from Pondicherry (old French India), attuned to spirituality in all its forms and a dedicated follower of at least three major religions.  His father, a zookeeper, decides to move the family (along with a few animals) to Canda for a new start.  Unfortunately, the boat sinks, leaving Pi the sole survivor on a life boat.  The sole human survivor, anyway, for he shares his 26-foot space with an orangutan, a hyena, and a tiger.  What follows is a tale of survival in its rawest form: the Young Boy and the Sea and the Tiger, if you will.  Martel writes with a certain fluidity of style: the first third is a delightful rumination on spirituality and Indian life through the eyes of a young boy; the main part of the book is a strange blend of detailed, realistic survival memoir and fantastic allegory in the medieval tradition (instead of Here There Be Dragons, you get Here There Be Meerkats, believe it or not).  The end, while probably disappointing for some, justified the entirety of the book to me, offering plenty of food for thought on the twin thirst for survival and faith.  It's not the finest book I've read all year, but I can see why it won the Booker prize.
B00005JLWN|5.0|First of all, I'll address some prior comments:  THIS IS NOT A MATRIX RIP-OFF.  The only things the two have in common are that they are sci-fi and action movies-THAT'S IT.  While I watched this, the Matrix didn't even enter my mind, and it didn't strike me at all afterwards until I read some Matrix-freak's review that tore into Equilibrium.<br />This is a no BS action movie that, unlike many that come out these days, has a great story to go along with it.  It was a lot better than usual action movies that get a great deal of hype, and was very well cast (Bale and Diggs give flawless performances).  This also surprised me that a film with such established actors (including the woman from Red Dragon-I'm sorry, I don't know her name) would be a limited release and be relatively unheard of in most parts of the country.<br />The makers of this movie surely did miss out on a great chance to make some serious money, as this movie is much more entertaining than the majority of the ... that's out there.  I'd recommend picking this up if you want great action or even if you just want an inventive movie that, unfortunately, went unappreciated.
B000002NBY|5.0|As you will see in the other reviews, this album makes people awestruck, ecstatic, blissful, even completely unhinged. ;-{)<br />And it makes me feel somewhere in that range too. This is a master work, a career peak of a true musical genius. The wonderful songs just come one after another. It's hard to pick favorites to talk about...I guess I'd have to go with &quot;Boy In The Bubble&quot;, &quot;Graceland&quot;, and &quot;Call Me Al&quot;. But these choices are purely arbitrary...all the songs are wonderful. There just isn't much more that can be added to the flood of praise that this album deservedly receives.<br />God help a poor blasphemer, but I have to dare to venture that there a few seconds, a handful of brief moments, when I find the African aspects a little annoying to my Wonder Bread ears...especially on &quot;I Know What I Know&quot; and the late throes of &quot;Homeless&quot;. But most of it is excellent...a revelation, an education, a badly needed blast from a direction badly needed in the rest of the world. And that earlier part of this paragraph was just mad ramblings from a lonely heretic; you can safely ignore it. ;-{)<br />10 stars out of 5. Buy 2 copies in case something happens to one of them. Wow.
B000002C4J|5.0|It was only a matter of time (very little time) before Celine made an amazing one of a kind albums with only the BEST of the BEST in the music industry.  This album is a gift to Celine listeners, with great collaborations from Pavarotti and Barbra Streisand, with songwriters and producers like Sir George Martin and Carole King, James Horner, and the list goes on...and the classic MY HEART WILL GO ON is such a beauty, only Celine pulls this song off.  The rest of the album is very cool too.  One word, amazing, a must addition for the collection. You go Celine!  Delivers her best.
B00008PW3Q|5.0|Upon first listen of this new fleetwood mac album, one may sit completely dumbfounded...almost shocked by what they are hearing.  Can a band who has been in the music bussines for more than 30 years really come up with something fresh and innovative?The answer...no.  Not unless, of course the driving force behind that band happens to be none other than Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham.  This album is pure GENIUS.  The astonishing prodction soars to new heights, not only for Fleetwood Mac, but for any band.<BR>Next question, Is Christine McVie missed on this album? Of course, but only just a smidgen.  Chistine's sharp pop ditties were a cornerstone of the Fleetwood mac sound and were some of fleetwood mac's greatest hits.In latter years, however some of Christine's material had become comparitive to cream of wheat. Not bad, but kind of bland as if they were manufactured in some kind of pop music making factory.  Stevie and Lindsey were and still are the passion of the \\"classic\\" fleetwood mac lineup and there is certainly no lack of passion on this project.<BR>Both have churned out some fine material here. Buckingham, always the studio ace, proves to be a production god on this album. Stevie Nicks, a songwriter who's well still hasn't run dry of mini-masterpieces (even after brilliantly tapping her resources for 2001's spectacular 'Trouble in Shangri-la') has done it again with the likes of \\"Illume (9-11),\\" Thrown down,\\"Destiny Rules\\" and what may be the centerpiece of the album, \\"Everybody finds Out.\\"<BR>Standout tracks include the above mentioned Nicks songs as well as Buckingham tunes \\"peacekeeper\\" (great Stevie and lindsey duet/harmonies here, also the first single) \\"Miranda\\" and \\"Come.\\" The albums closing tracks(\\"Say Goodbye\\" and \\"Goodbye baby\\")are emtionally charged and heart wrenching with the latter featuring the most delicately beautiful vocal ever recorded, in almost whisper like tones, sounding as if Nicks had been crying for hours beforehand. Two otherNicks tunes, \\"running through the Garden\\" and \\"say you will\\" are also highlights with \\"say you will\\" finding Nicks still having a flare for creating perfectly crafted pop...destined to be a radio hit.  Only when the mac mellows out as on buckingham tunes Steal your heart away\\" and \\"bleed to love her\\" (did we really need it again?) does the album lag momentarily, but only momentarily.<BR>HAving more of an edge to it than any past mac albums, this album has a slightly darker mood (Think \\"I'm so Afraid,\\" Sisters of the moon\\", \\"the Chain\\", \\"Gold dust woman\\") It also rocks a little harder and should be played at a sufficeint volume.<BR>Buy it now, play it often and play it LOUD as all great rock-n-roll music is meant to be played...For this album does just that.  It truly rocks. Thank you Stevie and Lindsey for creating yet another masterpiece.
B00008DDXC|5.0|The last HP Movie \\"The Sorcerer's Stone\\" was a marvelous adaptation of J.K. Rowling's first Harry Potter book and was hard to pull off onto the big screen but it was almost completely successful and truly amazing. Director Chris Columbus truly brings out the magic of Harry Potter onto the big screen and maintains the faith and magic of Rowling's novels. I have to say that the producers and cast have all outdone themselves on \\"Chamber Of Secrets\\"! <br />The second installment in the movie series begins with Potter being locked up in his room at the abusive Dursleys house in the London suburbs but is rescued and the movie brings the Potter, Weasley, and Granger trio into a much darker arena. The darkness of the dangers is first evident when an elf named Dobby warns Potter not to return to Hogwarts because of a mysterious phenomenon from a secret chamber being opened and students being `petrified' by it. Harry Potter though goes to Hogwarts in defiance of Dobby but runs into problems at platform 9 and ¾ but that's not the main danger and Harry, Ron, and Hermione face much more dangerous events that threaten Hogwarts as a dangerous chamber of secrets is being opened. They also try to uncover what happened when a Hogwarts student was killed 50 years before Potter first attended Hogwarts. Potter can hear a mysterious voice that the rest of the students can't hear that makes him even more unique. This movie overall has a much darker and spookier suspenseful tone and atmosphere than the last one and might scare some younger viewers so be cautious for those who are easily spooked. <br />We also meet new characters and including his archenemy Draco Malfoy's tyrannical father Lucius Malfoy. The rivalry between Harry and Draco also seems to grow more bitter as they get older especially with Malfoy's increasing bigtry against normal humans aka muggles. I just hope that it doesn't reach to like a `fight to the death' kind of rivalry though. Still though, it's fun to watch Malfoyhit major speed bumps when acting out his rivalry against Potter and endure embarrassments as a result. <br />The main difference that I have really noticed in \\"Chamber Of Secrets\\" is that the voices of all of the younger characters of Malfoy, Potter, and Weasley have really deepened between the last HP film and this one. All of the characters except Malfoy of course, show much more mature personality even with Ron's occasionally bumbling antics, he's a very entertaining character. The late Richard Harris deliveres his final role as Albus Dumbledore and is sorely missed by his fan base as well as the Harry Potter audiences as well. It's uncertain how well his replacement Michael Gambon will do in playing Dumbledore in \\"Prisoner Of Azkaban\\" but I'm almost 100 percent certain that he will do very well at it. <br />The choreography is once again astonishing. The flying \\"Enchanted Car\\" flying through the air was eye-popping and was great to watch instead of being cheesy and silly. <br />Overall, I have to say that \\"The Chamber Of Secrets\\" is a successful achievement and builds upon the success and greatness of \\"Sorcerer's Stone\\", resulting in a near-masterpiece if not an epic one. The movie is much longer than the last one, running at 2 hours and 40 minutes, scarier with occasional scenes that might be a little frightening for younger viewers, and more suspenseful than the last one. <br />There are two main unsettling scenes though for younger viewers or those who hate creepy-crawlies: <br />SNAKES: There are lots of them in the movie and it will creep the living daylights out of those who have fear of or revulsion towards snakes. `Snake Lovers' though, like most people, including me, will definitely enjoy this movie a lot. <br />SPIDERS: This will scare the living daylights out of those who suffer from arachnophobia and fear them like the plague. Arachnophobics (Correct me if I'm wrong) might want to hold on tight on the seats when the spider scenes come during various parts of the movie. I personally am not scared that much of spiders. <br />The two things I mentioned above will make some people's skin crawl but for me, I'm not scared of either snakes or spiders so they don't bother me in this movie at all. In fact, these are among my favorite of the creepy-crawlies so there you have it. I actually enjoy the spiders but let's not warp the subject of this review though. <br />The main thing that I didn't always enjoy though was Gilderoy Lockheart. I thought that his bumbling and occasionally egotistic character annoyed me and kind of spoiled the thrills of the darker parts of the movie. Professor Severus Snape is his usual cold-hearted and hateful self but that's how he was meant to be so it's all good. I thought that Moaning Myrtle was EXTREMELY ANNOYING. The other flaw IMHO was that there wasn't a whole lot of appearances of Snape. He's one of my favorite characters from the movie and deserved a larger role. Draco Malfoy is once again your typical Harry Potter archenemy and is in fact probably even crueler than the last movie and is accompanied by his even more villainous father Lucius Malfoy. God only knows how much worse the Malfoy family will get in the next HP movie especially after Draco insults Hermione. <br />Despite the frightening and darker tone of \\"The Chamber Of Secrets\\" and the bumbling of Gilderoy Lockheart, it is a fascinating and astonishing achievement in adapting Rowling's second novel to the big screen and is destined to become another classic in the years to come. Now begins the wait and anticipation for the third installment \\"Harry Potter and The Prisoner Of Azkaban\\" due out in 2004. <br />This is my favorite movie of 2002 behind \\"Lord Of The Rings: The Two Towers\\".
6304493681|5.0|Surpassing the anime classic Akira in terms of detail of animation and storytelling, Ghost in the Shell paved the way for the future of animation.  When you first watch Ghost in the Shell, the  mind bending animation is the first thing you'll notice; from the Blade Runner-esque urban landscape to the stylized character designs, Ghost in the Shell is a visual treat.  The storyline is also highly intelligent, taking place in the not too distant future when an enhanced human secret agent named Motoko finds herself caught up in a tangled web involving a wanted hacker named The Puppet Master.  All the hype thats surrounded Ghost in the Shell since it's release is more than true; this is a modern day anime masterpiece just as Akira was back in it's day, and serves as an important step in the evolution of anime, most of which influenced by this film.  All in all, this is one of the best anime's to be released in recent memory, and if you've never seen it I strongly recommend checking it out.
0312305060|5.0|At least for me, it made me see my everyday life in a different perspective. This is a great novel for everyone, any age, different stage in life...There's not a lot of action, it's very drama but it keep you read every pages till the very end.<BR>I find there's bit of dark and depression in this novel though,<BR>but on the otherside, you will see how some people waste their time of something that not really matter(specially Laura)<BR>that lead you to cherish your everyday life with joy. But if you look at this novel as their perspective, then it is kind of depress....Afterall, this novel is a meaningful work.
B00008PW3Q|5.0|I grew up on FM, and even with the abscence of Christine, Say You Will is knockout.  I've been reading these reviews, and some people have very odd tastes.  I don't understand how anyone can listen to the majority of the buckingham songs on this cd and not be blown away.  Stevie has written quite a few good tracks as well, but at the end I feel she didn't mix it up enough.  They both sound fantastic throughout, but a few of her songs are a miss.  I tried to like &quot;Illume,&quot; but the melody just doesn't catch me, although the percussion and guitars are good.  The title track is a very catchy tune that I can't get enough of, but I find myself listening through most of the cd without repeating any one song because I don't want to skip the later songs.  It's a great album, and there are no &quot;bad&quot; songs, but some of stevie's songs just don't have quite the power and awe-inspiring, goosebump-causing sound as most of buckingham's. My favs right now are &quot;Murrow&quot;, &quot;Say you will,&quot; &quot;Everybody finds out,&quot; &quot;Come,&quot; &quot;Peacekeeper,&quot; &quot;What's the world coming to,&quot; &quot;Running through&quot; and &quot;Say Goodbye.&quot; And did I mention that the cover just mesmerizes me?  I look at it all the time, it's such a great photo.  Enjoy the new FM, and see you at the concert.
B00008PW3Q|4.0|Reading over these reviews, I'm a bit dismayed to read that someone labeled this band as &quot;corporate rock&quot;, and that they'd rather listen to immature, poorly developed punk music.  I'm a big fan of transitional 70's-80's music as much as the next guy(believe it or not, you can be a fan of Fleetwood Mac and Talking Heads without being considered completly insane), but I can't ignore the staying power or genius of Fleetwood Mac.They may not have innovated music(unless you count Tusk, which you very much should check out if you haven't), but they're no &quot;Journey&quot; or &quot;Foreigner&quot;. The fact that they've substained their popularity this long proves that. That being said, this album recalls the best moments of that sprawling 1979 album, with brilliant production and guitar by Lindsey Buckingham, and Stevie Nicks' standard gypsy perona and crystal visions. What keeps this album from being truly excellent, however is it's length; at 76 minutes, it runs longer than even Tusk did, occasionally lagging in the middle. In addition,keyboardist/singer Chris Mcvie, who balanced out the extremes of Buckingham and Nicks, is greatly missed, and by the end of the album, her absence is all the more obvious. Still, the album has enough excellent momements to rank it among their best. Highlights include Miranda,Thrown Down,Come,Murrow,Running Through The Garden,Peacekeeper,Say You Will. Also reccomended by Fleetwood Mac: Fleetwood Mac, Bare Trees, Then Play On, Tusk, Rumors,Future Games, Mystery To Me.
B000088E6D|5.0|Coming from a background in classical music, I was pleasantly surprised to find myself swept away by Bubl on this, I gather, his first major label release.<BR> Given as a gift, it is now cherished as &quot;special&quot; in my somewhat eclectic music collection.<BR>  His fantastic version of That's All is so warm it touched my soul and incredibly gets the same results after each play.<BR>I am hopeful we will hear many more magical cd's from him - and soon please!!
B00005BJ2O|2.0|When I bought this cd, I was pretty excited.  The movie had been great and I really enjoyed the music.  This soundtrack, however, was a disappointment.  Most of the songs are cheesy and boring, with ultra pop-styled lyrics.  There are a few songs that are good, but only because they're the same as they were in the movie.  Most of the others were redone and poorly so.  I also bought the second soundtrack, and its inclusion of the more obscure but higher quality tracks from the movie, as well as just simply including the origninal tracks from the movie, make it a more enjoyable buy.
B00006AW2F|3.0|This CD is a compilation of Rolling Stones rarities.  Some are good, others are a bit butchered.  Out of Time is a great song but is marred by the string arrangement that gets way too much emphasis in the intro and the instrumental break.  The alternate take on Heart Of Stone is too country flavored.  Somehow it just does not sound right for a pop/rock flavored tune from the sixties.  Also too many songs just feature Mick, a little bit of Keith, and session musicians.  Should this even be classified as the Rolling Stones?<br />Highlights, there are several.  Love the way the Stones cover the Stevie Wonder tune, I Don't Know Why.  Great singing by Jagger and an awesome guitar solo by Mick Taylor as well as some super keyboards(probably by Nicky Hopkins).  Downtown Suzie is another well arranged tune and Family has a cool mysterious air about it.  The other tracks feature some catchy parts from each of the different Stones.<br />An interesting collection for sure.  However, there are so many other CD's to get before this.  Certainly not essential but intriguing in spots.

B000051Y0G|4.0|Such a brilliant debut from such a gifted vocalist/performer. This CD should be listed as a CYNDI LAUPER greatest hits package due to the amount of geunine radio hits found on this debut CD. On the basis of this release, &quot;La Lauper&quot; played to sold out concert venues worldwide and was asked to lend her vocals and support to the famous USA FOR AFRICA project (WE ARE THE WORLD).<br />SHE'S SO UNUSUAL is produced to perfection and is bombarded with massive radio hits such as &quot;SHE BOP&quot;, &quot;MONEY CHANGES EVERYTHING&quot;, plus her famous ballads &quot;TIME AFTER TIME&quot;, &quot;ALL THROUGH THE NIGHT&quot; and her 80s video anthem &quot;GIRLS JUST WANNA HAVE FUN&quot;.

0451167716|5.0|The Godfather, both in print and on screen, is the greatest story ever told. <br />The Godfather, the novel, is really interesting, and provides a great insight into what the characters feel, think and expereince. It also gives more information about Luca Brasi, Tom Hagen and many other people that were barely or not at all portrayed in the movie. I reccomend seeing the movie before reading the novel, because it gives you a clear picture of most of the events in the book, and it also allows you to visualize the characters in a better way. The Godfather tied up many loose ends and questions that I had after seeing the movie, and it made the plots and people much easier to comprehend. In addition to all of this, it is a beautiful novel (a bit racy- it goes into graphic detail about the relationship between Santino and Lucy Manelli (please excuse my horrendous spelling) and the flings that Johnny Fontane had. I was kind of bored by the extra Johnny Fontane plot, but the novel was, for the most part, very exiting.<br />The Godfather is a great cinematic acheivement, as well as a great book. Everyone should experience this work of art.
B00005J6SZ|4.0|This is a classic example of 80s Pop perfection. Madonna became a massive global star due to the strenght and quality of the production on this release. On this project, Madonna (aka: MADGE to her U.K. fans) continues to vocally sing in her higher register. Some may find her vocal performance to ressemble MINIE MOUSE trapped inside a danceclub. However, her vocals add more flavor to the 80s kitch factor. Having a massive hit with \\"LIKE A VIRGIN\\", considered as a controversial single for radio in the mid 80s and peaking at the #1 position on the BILLBOARD charts greatly assisted to turn little MADGE into \\"THE MTV DIVA of the 80s\\". Other radio hits on this album are \\"ANGEL\\", \\"DRESS YOU UP\\" and \\"LOVE DON'T LIVE HERE ANYMORE\\" while \\"OVER AND OVER\\" became a huge... danceclub hit in late 1984. (1984)
0425170349|5.0|I have always been a fantasy buff, but decided I needed a change. I had been playing Tom Clany's Ghost Recon and decided I would try one of his books. I wasn't more than 5 pages into the book before I was hooked for life. Mr. Clancy is a true genius. The story line was excellent and the characters where so well formed.<br />I must admit I was a little disappointed with the ending, but not in a way that would lower my rating of the book. The ending was excellent, I would have just liked to seen it done another way. But I don't want to ruin for anyone considering this book, so I will not go into detail.
B00005JKG9|4.0|This true to form movie was adapted from the stage yet was done better than any adaptation I've seen prior. The entire movie keeps your intrest with top notch actors like Al Pacino, Jack Lemmon, Kevin Spacey, the list goes on and on... high intensity and enjoyable to watch over and over. If you're into sales and human behavior I'd recommend you also purchase \\"Suckers\\" on DVD and \\"cars and People, pissing at 60 miles an hour\\" by Anthony Ziegler a wonderful book.
B00004Y6O9|5.0|this album is great!  almost every song is a winner (possible exception -- &quot;little dreamer&quot; and &quot;on fire&quot; are a bit boring).  eruption is of course amazing, and the four (yes, four) solos in &quot;im the one&quot; are excellent!  plus, &quot;feel your love tonight&quot; and &quot;you really got me&quot; are great rock classics with good, albeit short, solos.  and, my favorite, &quot;ice cream man&quot;, which is not only a great song, but it is funny!  take an old blues standby and put it on steroids!<br />    songs like &quot;atomic punk&quot;, &quot;jamie's cryin&quot;, and &quot;aint talkin bout love&quot; are awesome rock songs, but the solos aren't as amazing.  still, they balance out the album, and in the end, i don't think they could have done it better.  david lee roth makes it perfect, and is certainly better than anything &quot;van hagar&quot; ever did.<br />    eddie van halen practically invented shred.  shred, for those of you who don't know, is the art of playing guitar very, very fast, with high technical proficiency.  to correct a common misconception, eddie van halen is absolutely NOT the fastest guitarist on the planet -- not even in the top 20!  he was just the first to get famous playing really fast guitar.  i'd say the fastest is probably Danny-Joe Carter, followed closely by Michael Angelo Batio, and then Paul Gilbert.  of course, that doesn't make eddie any less cool!

B00005NZBN|5.0|This is the greatest music ever made.  This is the shallowest music ever made.  It is so profound.  It is darker than his earlier albums, yet in a way light.  It is very dark.  You MUST go out and buy this album now.  People who only like mainstream may not like this.  This is the best place to start for beginners.  I own all his albums, and it is by far the best.  He has become so commercial over the last few albums.  I prefer his earlier stuff back when he was more real.  Yes, even with all the electronics, this music is so REAL.  I remember the first time I heard this album.  I was sitting by the nacho stand at Wal-Mart listening on my personal CD player.  This was the day after 9/11.  I was nervous about my first date with a Peruvian female plumber.  But later I was more relaxed when she started playing &quot;Layla&quot; on the pan pipes.  That's what this album needs -- more pan pipes.
B000002H33|5.0|Well, everyone says its their best, but I have to disagree, RTL in my opinion was better, it just seemed more complete, every song had that \\"thing\\" to make it great, but this album did have very many excellent songs, some lacked (the thing that should not be), but yet Battery and Master of Puppets both amazed me.<br />1. Battery: Metallica's best song ever in my opinion, as soon as the heavyness comes in, it is near metal perfection.  Lars does some great drumming, the main riff throughout the song is also the best Metallica riff in my opinion.  The solo is a good solo, while it may not match up to ones like \\"Ride the Lightning\\" or \\"One\\", it is still good.  Don't forget Lars' drum fill/solo after the guitar solo, which is very good.  Also a very good lyrical performance, too.<BR>Rating: A+<br />2. Master of Puppets: To many, the best song on the album, to me, number 2.  While it does contain sweet riffs, especiall the main one, the drumming is kinda plain again.  One of the more progressive tracks of the speed metal ones on the album, yet great nontheless.  Maybe James' best lyrical perforance on the album.  The one thing this song is missing is a great solo, if it had one, it may have beaten out Battery for my favorite song on the album.<BR>Rating: A<br />3. The Thing That Should Not Be: This track is huge grower!  I despised the song at first, now I don't think its too bad.  Heavy, the verses are just flat out haunting, so is the whole song.<BR>Rating: C+<br />4. Welcome Home (Sanitarium): Similar to Fade to Black, yet 10x better.  Much better.<BR>Rating: C+<br />5. Disposable Heroes: 3rd best song on the album, and another epic.  A bit more thrasy than the title track, and an excellent song as well.  The one thing I do not like about the song is that the second verse seems to drag on towards the end of it.  Besides that, it is a very good song.<BR>Rating: A<br />6. Leper Messiah: Another good song, yet kinda slower until the middle of the song, which is when it gets VERY good, has a sweet solo, and a very cool ending (Lie! Lie! Lie! Lie!).  The best part is the riff before the song gets fast...such a sweet part.<BR>Rating: B+<br />7. Orion: An instrumental, not as good as Call of Ktulu, but very good performance here by Cliff Burton, but the rest of the song seems a bit too mellow for me.<BR>Rating: B<br />8. Damage Inc.: Another very fast song, and takes a little bit of time getting used to the lyrics, however the music and drumming are both good, and the one lacking part of the song is the chorus (except the last one).<BR>Rating: B+<br />So, get this album...
038572179X|5.0|At their best novels can take readers to another place, another time, make them feel like they have another life, they are another person. But, still readers depend on what is written, it is like the writer has the power over us readers, over what we read, where we go  to or even what we think. Some may say we are deceived, led to believe in what is written, or in what someone wants us to believe. In `Atonement' Ian McEwan gets all this concept of readers/writers a goes a bit futher. A narrative is an entity over which neither the reader nor the writer has much power once it is published.<br />At a low level, `Atonement' is a coming-of-age  story about a very imaginative girl named Briony. Frustrated and unable to understand the adult's world, she destroys  a relationship, and later on her family. In the background there is the WWII, and its effect upon Brittain and its people. But digging depper into the novel we are taken to a higher level, where everything is more sophisticated. McEwan rises very pertinent questions about literature: how reliable is what you are reading? Do you believe in what the writer (anyone, not McEwan specifically) has written? How does he/she know what he/she is talking about? Does he/she have to have experience everything he/she is writing about?<br />This is what makes `Atonement' so complex and great, in my opinion. In a age of fast-food novels, it is a relief to read such a deep and complex novel in which the writer is not worried about souding cool, more than that, he wants us reader to think. He wants us to doubt everything --even what he has written. In a time when most writers wants to be the owner of the truth, `Atonement' sheds a light showing that there is no such thing as an universal truth. Everything depends on who is telling, and what effects this person wants to cause in his/her audience. A highly recommended novel to `advanced' readers, who like to think while they are reading a novel!
4893581198|5.0|I agree with all the previous reviews of this series of Kanji textbooks. If you are just beginning to learn Kanji or are even approaching intermediate level, get this series of Kanji books. Is there another series which forces you to learn every aspect of writing and reading kanji while actually being entertaining to those who enjoy the study of Kanji? I had never seen anything like this series before i tried it and have never seen anything since that I think matches up to the high standard of these books. The authors of this book are aiming at an intelligent audience, something that other Kanji textbooks generally do not seem to do. If you don't already know of this series and want to study Kanji in context while enjoying yourself, run straight to the bookstore and buy it. If you are not convinced by this and other reviews, there is something wrong with you! Fantastic series...thanks, Bojinsha.
B00005JLEU|4.0|In my opinion this doesn't necessarily make the movie better.  I supposed I was expecting to see this movie and be utterly blown away a la \\"Princess Mononoke,\\" and in some ways I was.  It moved me and made me think, and the movie's artistry let my imagination soar free just as with \\"Mononoke.\\"<br />However, my first impression is that the coherency in that earlier Miyazaki film is missing here.  Being that this and \\"Mononoke\\" are the only two films of his I have seen, maybe this kind of movie is really more of his style and he isn't usually as lucid or accessible as he was with \\"Mononoke,\\" yet I still think that film set a standard for storytelling, emotion, and beauty that few, if any, movies have matched since.  The plot progressed at a thrilling pace, and the conclusion was perfect and utterly satisfying.<br />\\"Spirited Away,\\" on the other hand, doesn't progress nearly as smoothly.  In fact, the only real (coherent) plot development occurs in the first 45 minutes or so of the movie, with the changing of Chihiro's parents to pigs, her introduction to the bath house, her meeting with Haku and Yubaba, and her meeting with No Face.  After that, to a certain degree, the movie seems to meander plot-wise.  Though characters are put into dilemnas here and there, you never really get the feeling that they're in true danger, or that any of the plot elements really are that crucial.  Despite the fact that I admire the gray-area nature of good and evil in Miyazaki's films, I think it would've served the movie's plot and development better if Yubaba had been more maliciously cast.  Might be fault of the translation, but I don't know...<br />There are some elements that make little sense with the overarching themes and plot line of the movie, as well.  No Face is possibly the biggest example of this.  He/she/it just seems to be thrown in to add meat to the plot, and little more.  It's an interesting diversion, but it makes little sense with the story, besides highlighting thetheme of greed, possibly.  Which brings me to another aspect I didn't like so much: themes of maturation and love were (pretty) well dealt with, but the theme of greed was probably too overdone, especially with Chihiro's parents turning into pigs and No Face's handing out of gold to everyone.<br />Being as I've viewed it all the way through only once, it might need some time, but so far I just don't see the coherency of \\"Mononoke\\" here.
B00005AFVR|5.0|In 1984 Bruce Springsteen's Born in the USA album sold 18 million copies. The man whose fans saw him as an avatar of the spirits of Walt Whitman, Woody Guthrie, Jack Kerouac and John Steinbeck was suddenly a pop star. And it wasn't by accident. <br />The songs slotted right into hit radio and commercial ambitions had put a close up of Mr. Springsteen's rear-end, in tight jeans, on the album cover. But the huge American flag that framed the shot of Springsteen's ... was there because Springsteen still hoped, in a Whitmanesque way, to persuade America to call itself to account for the distance between its harsh realities and its legitimating myths of freedom and equality. <br />But pop stars aren't taken that seriously and most people missed the point. The title track of Born in the USA is a radical critique of American society. But when Ronald Regan, whose conservative politics Springsteen loathed, used it in his election campaign, most of Springsteen's new fans didn't see the contradiction. <br />In 1995 Springsteen made a decisive break with hit radio and pop stardom with the visionary Ghost of Tom Joad. Inspired by Steinbeck's Grapes of Wrath, each of its deeply moving and politically radical songs is about people battling against the odds to make some kind of life for themselves and their families. The album manages to simultaneously mourn social injustice and affirm the resilience of the human spirit. And because Springsteen dispensed with sing-along choruses and laid his half spoken half sung lyrics over evocative soundscapes it's impossible to misunderstand the vision of the album. <br />But, while many critics regard the Ghost of Tom Joad as one of the greatest American albums ever, it was far too good for hit radio and didn't win a mass audience. Springsteen had not expected the album to be a commercial success but was pleased that it won back his original fans and inspired the best amongst the new generation, including Rage Against the Machine, who later covered the title track. <br />Now, seventeen years after Born in the USA, Springsteen has returned to a mass audience with Bruce Springsteen and the E-Street Band Live in the USA. The album entered the American charts at number 5, is still selling by the truck load and is rich with the choruses, riffs, melodies and borrowings from blues, soul, gospel and country that have given rock its excitement and popular appeal. But the album's often joyous and celebratory feel has not been achieved at the expense of any political or artistic compromise. <br />Springsteen, a man who thinks very carefully about every aspect of his work, has chosen to join The Clash and Rage Against the Machine by emblazoning his new album with the radical symbol of a five-pointed star. The five-pointed star is an ancient symbol of immanence, the idea that the sacred, or God, inheres in humanity, in the here and the now. An important part of the enormous spiritual power of Springsteen's work lies in his ability to transcend the division between the sacred and the profane by locating real value in the struggles, compromises, conflicts and triumphs in the everyday lives of ordinary people. His brings careful attention and real wisdom to the world of work, family, friendship and the jol. Springsteen's art, in other words, is grounded in immanence. And immanence is an inherently radical idea - because when God, America, The Leader, The Market or anything else is set up as a transcendent force above human life humanity is abased. Springsteen's political commitments may not have changed that much since Born in the USA, but in 2001 he's not allowing anyone to misunderstand or misrepresent his ethics.<br />This album features dramatically new interpretations of some of his best songs. If I Should Fall Behind is turned into an exquisitely tender duet with Patti Scialfa and there are rousing versions of Born to Run, Badlands and Tenth Avenue Freeze out; a stripped down and mournfully bluesy Born in the USA;a defiant and resolute Youngstown; a steaming Murder Incorporated; a version of Mansion on the Hill even more haunting than the original; a soaring Jungleland and an interpretation of The River which could raise goosebumps on the dead or, which is much the same thing, fans of hit radio. There are also a number of new songs, including the celebrated American Skin (41 Shots) which was written in response to the extraordinarily violent murder of an unarmed African immigrant by the New York Police Department. It has led to the NYPD calling Springsteen `commie scum' and refusing to provide any security at his shows. But it is an exceptionally powerful song and Rolling Stone were quite correct to advise their readers that this song, alone, is easily worth the cost of the double album. The slightly baroque `introducing the band' bit wears thin after a few listens. But that's a small price to pay for nineteen songs performed with rare passion, insight and musical brilliance.
0913866156|5.0|I have utilized the Thoth Tarot Deck for approximately 14 years, and I highly recommend it as the Best Deck currently available. It was the Tarot Deck that was recommended to me as a Neophyte 0=0 of the Hermetic Order of the New Aeon.<br />Please note that this particular Form of the Deck is rather Large. It is more suitable for professional readings than the Smaller Deck, however, the colors on this Deck are not as vibrant as those on the Smaller Deck.<br />The Thoth Tarot Deck is based upon the mystical system of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. To the un-initiated this proves to be rather confusing at times. For example, the Minor Arcana are devoid of the Traditional Pictures often associated with them. Instead, the Aspects (ie. Wands, Cups, Swords, and Disks) of the Minor Arcana are arranged according to the Tree of Life glyph of the Qabalah (ie. 10 of Disks = Wealth, since it corresponds to Malkuth-Kingdom in the Alchemical Element of Earth). Also, the Minor Arcana are associated with various Astrological Signifiers (ie. 10 of Disks = Wealth, since it represents Mercury in Virgo and corresponds to the 3rd Decan of Virgo known as Bootes).<br />The Thoth Tarot Deck is the most Accurate Deck available today. Aleister Crowley discovered that \\"Tzaddi is not Star\\".(Liber Al vel Legis 1:57) This simply means that the Hebrew letter known as Tzaddi, which is associated with The Star in the Traditional Decks, should really be associated with The Emperor instead, and, therefore, the Hebrew letter known as Heh should be applied to The Star. This solves the Riddle of the Sphinx and completes the Circle of the Zodiac, since Tzaddi refers to Aries and Heh signifies Aquarius.<br />No other Deck has corrected this Error!! The Thoth Tarot Deck is the only Corrected Deck!!<br />Also, the artwork by Frieda Harris is absolutely stunning. It is very Impressionist and utilizes Light profoundly. In fact, these Cards can serve as an excellent Catalyst for Psychic Power, a method that can be ascertained through my own Mystical Order known as \\"Chavurah Nogah - Guild of Venus\\".<br />The only \\"possible\\" detriment to the Thoth Tarot Deck is that fact that it is intrically linked to Aleister Crowley's own Religion of Thelema. Therefore, a few of the Trumps or ATU (Major Arcana) and the Minor Arcana are substantially different in meaning from the Traditional Decks. For example, ATU XI has been changed from Strength to Lust. This is due to the Thelemic doctrine concerning the Scarlet Lady Babylon and the Beast 666 from Revelation, whereas the Traditional Decks demonstrate a female version of Daniel in the Lion's den. Other than this, this Tarot Deck comes highly recommended.<br />Shalom - Soror Samhainthat can be ascertained through my own Mystical Order known as \\"Chavurah Nogah - Guild of Venus\\". <br />The only \\"possible\\" detriment to the Thoth Tarot Deck is that fact that it is intrically linked to Aleister Crowley's own Religion of Thelema.

B00000DHTF|4.0|A key part of the genius of artists like Springsteen, Dylan and Marley is that they have focused their rich talent so closely on the particular details of the world around them that the acuteness of their vision has given their art a universal resonance. <br />Naturally there are times when Springsteen's music is just the fuel for a party, a melody to hum or a rhythm to get a hand taping in a traffic jam. But for the initiated Springsteen's gifts go way beyond providing a soundtrack to, or even shaping the mood of, a moment in time. His clear, poetic vision and rich soul can change the way that people understand, experience and sculpt their time. Springsteen's stories of everyday life are infused with a clarity, compassion and vitality that brings real wisdom down to the everyday world of work, family, friendship and cutting loose.<br />Springsteen's twenty five years as a recording artist have resulted in 11 studio albums, 2 live collections, a greatest hits package and numerous side projects. And, of course, an intense and remarkably durable mystique. <br />After years of composing on an old piano rotting away in the back of a beauty salon and battling to find venues that would give space to original music Springsteen finally released his first album, the primarily acoustic Greetings From Asbury Park NJ, in 1973. Despite being evicted from his flat and having to bum space in a garage he was able to bring out his second album, The Wild, The Innocent and the E-Street Shuffle within a year of the first. The seeds of his genius were gloriously clear in his first two albums and the strength of songs like Blinded By The Light, It's Hard to be a Saint in the City and Rosalita took Springsteen and his band from the backstreet bars of New Jersey to a small but passionately enthusiastic international cognoscenti. He wasn't the only person building on the legacy of musicians like Leadbelly and Woody Guthrie but there was something special about his stories of growing up, battling to get decent work, time slipping away, family, cars, girls, bosses, friends, judges and the search for some kind of redemption in the midst of the Vietnam war, race riots and economic depression. <br />When Born to Run hit the streets in' 75 Springsteen's picture went straight to the covers of Time and Newsweek and he was, famously, hailed as the future of rock by leading journalist Jon Landau. The stories of faith, hope and daily struggle on the equally superb Darkness on the Edge of Town cemented his status as a musician and chronicler of working class American life. And when a journalist asked him what rock'n'roll was he answered \\"It's me and my band going out to the audience tonight and growing older with that audience.\\" An unusual answer from an unusually perceptive rock star.<br />Then came the sublime and widely celebrated The River which was followed by the the folky but dark Nebraska which Springsteen recorded in his bedroom on a 4 track tape machine. And in 1984, Born in the USA was unleashed and Springsteen's life changed forever. At the time he had doubts about certain tracks and he says that he still feels ambivalent about the album. But 18 million people rushed to get a copy and from LA to Istanbul Springsteen was `The Boss'. The themes - trouble with the law, breaking loose, life not working out as planned, doing time in dead end jobs, Vietnam and so on were familiar but some of the fans didn't like the American flag on the cover, the lesser role given to the sax and keyboards and the shorter, less ornate presentation of the songs. Q Magazine even went so far as to say that it was \\"as calculated a product as anything by Stock Aitken and Waterman.\\" Time has shown this judgment to be a clear over reaction but it is true that the title track, Born in the USA, was totally misinterpreted. The song is a penetrating critique of American society but when the Republican Party, who stand for everything that Springsteen has spent a life rejecting, used itin their election campaign it was clear that something had gone very wrong. <br />Springsteen explains that: \\"In order to understand the song's intent, you need to invest a certain amount of time and effort to absorb both the music and the words. But that's not the way a lot of people use pop music. For most music is primarily an emotional language; whatever you've written lyrically almost always comes in second to what the listener is feeling. Should form follow content? I had two experiences that illustrate how this works in the real world. The fist guy I played the finished version of Born in the USA for was Bobby Muller, president of the Vietnam Veterans of America. He sat there listening to the first couple verses and then a big smile crossed his face. But then, for years after the release of the album, at Halloween, I had little kids at my door with their trick or treat bags singing `I was born in the USA'. They were not particularly well versed in the `Had a brother at Khe San lyric...'. But they all had plenty of lung power when the chorus rolled around. I guess the same fate awaited Woody Guthrie's This Land is Your Land around the campfire. But that's never made me feel any better.\\" These days he only performs a stripped down blues version of the song to make sure that its meaning can't be misconstrued.<br />His next release was the critically acclaimed 3 CD (5 LP) 40 song collection Live 1975-1985. It was an essential part of every rock collection and seemed to please the old fans as well as those who'd come to Springsteen though the Born in the USA album. The pressure to follow up Born in the USA with more of the same was huge but with The Tunnel of Love Springsteen followed his heart and went back to home recording. He explains that \\"For twenty years I'd written about the man on the road. On Tunnel of Love that changed, and my music turned to the hopes and fears of the man in the house.\\" The album's quieter and more reflective tone pleased the old fansand scored some hits with songs like Tougher Than The Rest and Brilliant Disguise. Although it was a little too slow and nuanced for some of the newer fans Springsteen was still The Boss. <br />But then he left his wife, his band and his working class New Jersey community for a new life in a $14 million dollar mansion in the Hollywood Hills. His fans, some of whom had even hoped that Springsteen would eventually chant down Tinsel Town, were not impressed. They felt betrayed and although the two albums which he bought out in 1992, Human Touch and Lucky Town, were both commercially successful and had the insight and wisdom of his earlier work it was true that the grittyness was gone. <br />He explained that Human Touch is essentially about how \\"people search to find some emotional contact, some modest contact, some modest communion, some physical and sexual connection. But to receive what love delivers, they have to surrender themselves to each other and accept fate.\\" Lucky Town , he said, is \\"about everything from second chances to trying to do the best for one's family and live up to one's beliefs when you're living in a racially segregated society.\\" No one was listening though and from New York down to Rio and across to Jo'burg , Sydney and Tokyo journalists, sometimes gleefully and sometimes sadly, told their readers that `The Boss' was now just another old school rocker getting burnt by the grunge explosion.<br />But Springsteen was aware of the ironies of his position and on Lucky Town he sang that \\"It's a sad funny ending to find yourself pretending/ A rich man in a poor man's shirt.\\" On Human Touch the old theme of trouble with the law was still there but this time the song's character was in front of a judge for disturbing the peace of the Hollywood Hills by putting a bullet in his TV because he had a satellite dish on the roof, 57 channels on the remote and nothing on. But the social sensitivity and awareness of ambiguity was just as much in evidence as always. On a track off Lucky Town called Souls of the Departed he sang about a seven year old killed in the crossfire of a down town gang war and how: <br />Tonight as I tuck my own son in bed<BR>All I can think of is what if it would've been him instead<BR>I want to build me a wall so high nothing can burn it down<BR>Right here on my own piece of dirty ground.<br />The release, in 1993 of the decidedly pedestrian In Concert MTV -Plugged made it seem like Springsteen was now just going though the motions. The 1995 Greatest Hits compilation was a huge seller but, despite the inclusion of a couple of very good new tracks written for other projects, people wondered if this wasn't just nostalgia.<br />Then in 1995 Springsteen stunned the musical world with the release of the stripped down acoustic album The Ghost of Tom Joad. Inspired by Steinbeck's Grapes of Wrath each of its deeply moving 12 tracks is about people battling against the odds to make some kind of life for themselves and their families. And this time, to make sure that no one could misunderstand the stories he was telling, Springsteen took the radical step of dispensing with both melody and chorus. Instead he laid his half spoken half sung lyrics over evocative soundscapes and the result was an album which is impossible to misconstrue. It's a beautifully poetic album that simultaneously mourns social injustice and affirms all the resilience of the human spirit. And it's greatness is evident in the fact that its absence of sing along choruses doesn't stop it form being as engaging as the most seductive pop record<br />Looking back Springsteen explains that \\"In California there was a sense of a new country being formed on the edge of the old. But the old stories of race and exclusion continued to be played out. I tried to catch a small piece of this on the songs I wrote. I knew that The Ghost of Tom Joad wouldn't attract my largest audience. But I was sure the songs on it added up to a reaffirmation of the best of what I could do. The record was something new, but it was a reference point to the things that I tried to stand for and be about as a songwriter.\\" It was too good for most radio but critics and serious fans loved it. Again Springsteen was being hailed as everything from America's conscience to the saviour of rock's integrity and the man carrying the torch lit by Walt Whitman and fueled by the likes of Robert Johnson, Leadbelly, Woody Guthrie, John Steinbeck, Jack Kerouac and Bob Dylan.<br />That brings us to Tracks, the beautifully packaged collection released early in December `98. Because Springsteen's albums have had strong themes many good songs haven't been able to slot into a particular album. As he explains on the first page of the 56 page book that accompanies the beautifully packaged 4 CD box set: \\"This collection contains everything from the first notes I sang in a Columbia recording studio, my early and later work with the E Street Band, through my music in the 90's. It's the alternate route to some of the destinations I traveled on my records, an invitation into the studio on the many nights we spent making music in search of the records we presented to the you. I'm glad to finally be able to share this music; these are the ones that got away.\\"<br />People have learnt to be wary of the overhyped Christmas time release of albums made of B-sides or previously unreleased material. These sorts of projects have too often been a poor excuse to make a few final bucks out of a dying career. But although 56 of the 66 songs in the collection have never before been released in any form faith in Springsteen is such that people didn't wait for airplay or reviews to buy the boxset. On the day of release a large number of American stores had to stay open till midnight to cope with the demand. <br />The songs were recorded between March 1972 and August 1998, but because Springsteen has always put meaning before fashion, each one has the timeless feel that sets great music apart from mere product. From the brilliantly executed, stripped down bluesy folk of his first ever demo through to his mid-career jazzy rock and the more martial sounds of the early '80s, to his recent return to the raw roots rock, every song in the collection is as least as good as any previously released work. <br />The musicianship is equally superb, the vocals are as deeply evocative as ever, and the melodies have warmth and power. From mournful meditations to euphoric celebrations, the lyrics are honest without being self-indulgent, intelligent and deeply poetic without being pretentious, progressive without being sanctimonious, fun and uplifting without being vacuous, vital without being contrived or macho, funny without being crass and, most of all, beautiful without ever being trite. <br />Why were these songs released only in 1999? Springsteen's not saying much more than, \\"My albums became a series of choices - what to include, what to leave out? I based my decisions on my creative point of view at the time - the subject I was working on, something musical or emotional I was trying to express ... [so] a lot of my favourite things remained unreleased.\\" <br />Like his other work the songs here are honest without being self indulgent, intelligent and deeply poetic without being pretentious, progressive without being sanctimonious, fun and uplifting without being vacuous, vital without being contrived or too macho, funny without being crass and beautiful without ever being trite or cheesy. But the songs here differ from his previous work in that many of them are lighter and happier.<br />Taken individually, each song could have comfortably been slotted into other Springsteen albums. Taken as a whole, this collection is quite different. Although there are gripping versions of darker classics like \\"Stolen Car\\" and \\"Born in the USA\\", as well as plenty of newly released songs about things such as ending up on the wrong side of a knife, seeing an emptinessin your child's eyes and drifting in search of work, most of the previously unreleased songs are a lot more exuberant, celebratory and happy than the work he has previously made available. <br />Perhaps the most dramatic contrast is the difference between \\"Jackson Cage\\" from The River and \\"Where the Bands Are\\" from Tracks. Some of the words and parts of the melody of the two songs are exactly the same, and while both songs are set in the same working-class context and share an underlying theme of struggle, the first is a dark critique of poverty, alienation and hopelessness while the second is a spirited celebration of music, community and love. <br />The lines \\"You can try with all your might/ But you're reminded every night/ That you've been judged and handed life/ Down in the Jackson cage\\" could not be more different from \\"Tonight I wanna feel the beat of the crowd/ And when I love you/ I wanna have to shout it out loud/ Shout it out loud\\". <br />Springsteen has said that he was uncomfortable with \\"No Surrender\\" from Born in the USA because, \\"You don't hold out and triumph all the time in life. You compromise, you suffer defeat; you slip into life's grey areas.\\" <br />Listening to Tracks, it seems that Springsteen has consciously kept back songs which don't raise an obvious finger to the myth of the \\"American dream\\". Although it is politically just as important to affirm as it is to accuse and reject, his caution does make sense in the light of the Republican Party's inability to understand \\"Born in the USA\\". <br />But it's meant that there is a crucial part of the human condition which, until now, Springsteen has not explored in public in his usual depth. After all, without acceptance, excitement, love and happiness, there's no energy for getting up in the morning, let alone for political struggle. <br />Tracks not only shows that Springsteen produces quality at an astoundingly prolific rate, but that the emotional range of his work is wider than was previouslyevident. It also feels like the missing piece of the Springsteen puzzle.
B00005JLKN|4.0|If sequels are traditionally worst than the original, prequels are less obvious. While Star Wars seems to show that they can be as terrible, a comparaison between Hannibal and Red Dragon is definitively a point in favour of prequels. <br />In Red Dragon, Hannibal says \\"a rational society would have killed me, or put me to some use\\". This is not only an interesting sentiment, but also a reflection of his character in movies - either stop using his character, or put him to some use. The movie Hannibal didn't get that. Red Dragon does, and that's one of the things it gets right. <br />Another thing it gets right is serial killers - or in this case, one serial killer, Red Dragon, who has killed two families and will kill more unless Agent Graham, the man who got Hannibal in prison (as told during the delicious opening scenes), gets on the case. Having established a patient-doctor relationship with Hannibal, who is a top-rate psychologist, Graham appeals to him again to help him solve this case. But Hannibal has an agenda of his own as well. <br />Red Dragon is trying a bit too hard to psych people. It has a number of false alerts (as well as an ending which serves absolutely no purpose) and a trivial character (the reporter, who serves as little more than foil). It could have been more, but as a portrayal of serial killers, Hannibal Lector, and interesting mysteries, it's right on the dot.
B00008PW3O|4.0|I think this special edition is a little pricey. For the extra 10 dollars it cost to get this special edition, you get fancy packaging and a 4 song &quot;bonus&quot; cd. The cd is also enhanced (which I can't even use). I think this band sorely misses Christine McVie as I know I did. I think she adds a centering and sensible quality to her songs which the other two singers definitely lack. Lynsay Buckingham's song craftsmanship and guitar paying are excellent as usual. I love the song piecemaker which utilizes both Lynsay Buckinham's and Stevie Nick's vocals. I also liked several of Stevie Nick's songs like &quot;throw down&quot; and &quot;say you will&quot;. Lyndsay Buckinghams songs as well as many of Stevie Nick's are kind of out there. They don't seem to be any more centered than they were in their hay day. Still, A true fleewood mac fan would want the special edition, but for the casual fan, stick to the cheaper version.
B00003CXSP|3.0|Hannibal is the sequel to Silence of the Lambs. Most sequels are inane rehashings of previous elements that made a success - Hannibal is very different but still inane, perhaps much more inane because it did *not* rehash what made SotL a success. <br />The sophisticated serial killer Hannibal Lector is free, trying to get a job as curator of an important library in Florence. We follow the bumblings of Pazzi, a policeman who is lured by a rich former victim of Hannibal to capture him, with the predictable grizzly results. Hannibal comes back to the States, stalks Agent Starling (who is suspended after a drug bust gone wrong, in a number of scenes that transpire stupidity), plays mind games with her, and finally confronts her in her own home, eating the brain of her rival Paul Krendler in a memorable scene. <br />The first half of Hannibal is great, apart from Pazzi's stupidity. Let's face it, even for three million dollars, would you repeatedly talk to a guy who's on the FBI's Most Wanted list and knows you are a policeman looking for him, alone ? <BR>The second half of Hannibal is completely off-kilter. We don't care about the relationship between Hannibal and Starling except insofar as they give us insights in their psychology. Anything else is pedestrian and alien to the whole idea of Hannibal Lector. This movie thinks that Starling's ineffectual attempts to kill Hannibal at the end are interesting. They are not. This was a major missed opportunity. Also, the whole story of Mason Verger, a man who disfigured himself under the influence of drugs provided by Hannibal, is not interesting, nor is it necessary to the plot. <br />The horror scenes are terrific ...There is a masterpiece in there, I know this for certain, and I know it could be made - but here it is buried under incompetent policemen, disfigured power-pushers, snowglobes, and unfulfilled promises.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Wow! There's no doubt X-tina has grown as woman as well as a musician. \\"Stripped\\", her 2nd and long anticipated album is just amazing. With this album she's showing everybody just how capable she is to sing in any musical format. \\"Stripped\\" is what every X-tina fan was waiting for... a well produced, written and HARDCORE music album. Personally I was more than pleased with this album and I hope X-tina will keep doing such an amazing job on future productions like she did on this one. Some of the songs that really stand out are: Walk Away, Fighter, Impossible, Beautiful, Cruz (MY PERSONAL FAVORITE from the whole album), Soar, The Voice Within & I'm Ok. Lot of fans will love: Make Over, Dirrty, Infatuation and the WHOLE ALBUM. Definitively \\"Stripped\\" will push X-tina to stand out from all the other pop singers in the music bussiness and will let her brake the common stereotypes of it. Go out and buy this album, u won't regret it!!! And by the way, this girl CAN SING!!! :)
B00005YW4H|5.0|I picked up this CD pretty early on, before all of the grammy hype had hit.  I think the fact that it hasn't left my cd player since then speaks for itself.  I rate it as the best album I've bought in the last 3 years.  Make sure you pack it if you're going to be stranded on a desert island!
6305537798|3.0|Well I went to this movie not sure what I'd be seeing, but it was actually pretty good, this is probably due to the fact that it was based on Shakespere rather than written from scratch. As such it is pretty much required to have more depth of character and plot than your average &quot;teen&quot; flick.  <BR>To be honest, what I liked best was that it was filmed at Stadium High School (which passes for Padua High in the movie) in Tacoma WA near where I live and the shots of the school etc are great (it looks like a castle).<BR>But I digress, I do recommend this movie and NOT just for teen girls, but for anyone who's looking for a basically light-hearted story of love and betrayal and more.
B00005JLEU|2.0|This movie had the critics falling all over one another to trumpet how fantastic it was, and I'm sure few want to disagree and be perceived as cultural barbarians. Well, here's one voice to say loud and clear that this emperor isn't wearing anything!! I had never really watched a full length anime feature before, though I always felt the human images were rather disturbingly robotic. Yet I was prepared for greatness after reading all the gushing reviews. What a disappointment! Yes, the animation is attractive and the characters visually original and bizarre. But the narrative is just so weak. One strange, disconnected  occurrence after another, some completely inexplicable (at least to the Western mind), odd gaps in logic and continuity, characters who switch pointlessly from brusque to warm, from irritable to hospitable. What in heaven's name is the point of it all? (I suppose you could also say there is no point to the string of adventures and characters that comprise Alice in Wonderland, but at least they are clever and funny, and the wordsmithing is a joy.) My 11-year-old daughter and I kept giggling at the dopiness and arbitrariness of \\"Spirited Away\\", and I nearly fell asleep as it dragged into the second hour. I don't recall this being a hit in the theaters, and I think its audience in the DVD arena will be limited to anime [fans]. I certainly can't imagine any child under 9 or 10 having the patience to last for more than 30 minutes of the movie.
B00008PW3O|3.0|I have almost every LP FM has put out - from the Peter Green days all the way through (except Time).  There are a couple good tunes here but mostly this is a poorly recorded hodgepodge of the good the bad and the ugly.<BR>First - the recording is harsh and very digital. The music, except some of the vocals is congested, compressed and sounds more like sample instruments were used than real ones Try Rumors, then Tusk and now Say You Will in that order and you will see how the studio master Buckingham has sacrifised sound quality for sound wizardry (The Dance sounded great - mostly because I believe it was a less tampered with recording).  The highs are truncated and etched - to a point where Mick's symbols sound manufactured (are they?).  To many groups with $$$ add so much ... and processing that they lose the sound of the instruments in real space.  Also it seems Lindsey puts sounds together just for the sake of doing it.  I hope he enjoys these songs and has enough money to forgo sales because most of his stuff here, although technically talented and original, is mostly noise.  At least his From the Cradle had some excellent tunes.  As for Stevie - her voice is almost shot.  She would be better off creating songs that fit her voice - go bact to Tusk and listen to her there - awesome.  My advice to FM - go back to the basics - skip the digital processing, stop adding sounds because you can, put out an analog recording that captures your evolving strengths and keep it simple. (for a good example of this listen to the Cowboy Junkies Trinity Sessions - recorded live in a church with one microphone, a DAT recorder and no overdubs or tricks.  Every instrument and voice sound awesome)
6305003882|3.0|The 1995 film is based on the autobiography, published in 1978 by Jim Carroll, about his descent into heroin addiction as a teenager.  Starring Leonardo DiCaprio as a Catholic school student, it shows him enjoying being part of a winning high school basketball team, sniffing glue and taking part in petty crimes.  It's set in a Hollywood version of a gritty New York Manhattan neighborhood, and, as a New Yorker myself,  I must say I was confused about exactly where it was.<br />DiCaprio writes poetry in a notebook and visits a dying friend in the hospital.  I guess that's supposed to show how sensitive he is.  There are also some supposedly moving scenes where he is strung out on drugs and begging his mother, played by Lorraine Bracco, to give him some money.  However, in spite of his tears and his rantings and ravings, he never became a sympathetic character to me.  Maybe it was because of script, which didn't let the audience know exactly what it was that either turned him to drugs or made him stop.  And maybe it was because he just can't stop being Leonardo DiCaprio.<br />Mark Wahlberg is cast as one of his pals, and so is James Madio.  And Julliette Lewis has a small part as a young prostitute.  All these people are just background though for DiCaprio, who is in every single scene and whose character dominates the film which is blissfully only 103 minutes long and moved fast enough to hold my attention.  Too bad it just isn't good enough.  Perhaps DiCaprio fans might like it, but I just can't recommend it.
B000065AQU|5.0|Soad is the best. john is the best. daron is the best. serj is the best. and yes shavo is the best. this cd is awsome along with all of their cd's. i suggest buying them all now.
0316666343|1.0|I borrowed this book from the library, and read it fairly quickly and was very disappointed in it. While I like the theory of our loved ones being able to view us and share in our lives from heaven, I found the book disappointing. I agree with the other reviewers that the only character one could relate to was the father. And to think of the mother having an adulterous affair and then later abandoning her family because she couldn't deal with the pain, I wanted to slap her. One reviewer said that she had a &quot;heavy&quot; feeling when she finished the book, and I agree with her, but I also have a nauseous feeling as well. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone.
0385504209|3.0|While a bit formulaic, and saddled with inconsistent characters who are by turns unbelievably brilliant or completely obtuse, depending on the demands of the plot at any given moment, &quot;The DaVinci Code&quot; is undeniably a page-turner.  Paced like an old Republic Serial, it is written in &quot;real-time&quot; and obviously meant to be read the same way -- in one long haul.  The problem for some readers (myself included) will be prior familiarity with the &quot;secret&quot; upon which the book hinges:  the true nature of the Holy Grail.  Anyone who has read &quot;Holy Blood, Holy Grail&quot; (which is actually referenced in the story) or has prior knowledge of the &quot;mystery&quot; of Rennes le Chateau or the Priory of Sion, which was a big story about fifteen or so years ago that turned out to be a hoax, will find the revelation of the &quot;shocking&quot; secret about as surprising as the fact that winter follows fall. However, those who are not familiar with these earlier references, a category that includes all the main characters of &quot;The DaVinci Code&quot; -- when the plot demands it -- will probably be shocked and awed by this book.  But it's best not to take it as seriously as the author seems to be asking us to.
B00003CXB7|3.0|Even now, thirty years after it's release, I can still get a few good laughs out of this movie. There are nonstop teenage pranks pulled off by Hawkeye, Trapper, and Duke and they seem to be masterfull surgeons. How it is that nobody can by the series and not this is beyond me.<br />I recommend this title along with \\"Animal House\\" and the entire \\"MASH\\" series.
B00008PW3Q|3.0|I have almost every LP FM has put out - from the Peter Green days all the way through (except Time).

Shame though cause Lindsay knows how to do it he just doesn't know when to stop - sometimes silence if a friend and less is more. As for Stevie - her voice is very frail. She should stick to songs that fit her voice - like Smile at You or something like songs found on Tusk. My advice to FM - go back to the basics - skip the digital processing, stop adding sounds because you can, put out an analog recording that captures your evolving strengths and keep it simple.
B000000WHX|4.0|'Blue Lines' is so refreshing for a record made in 1991 in that it sounds nothing like anything that came before it. Sure, its spawned imitators since, but nothing before was quite like Blue Lines. Built on the exciting principle of collaboration, these are perfectly constructed songs blending chilled-out, ambient beats with vocals of various styles - soul, reggae and rap and synths and keyboard effects that fill out a beautiful spectrum of sound.<br />The album divides into two halves - the good songs and the incredible songs. The four incredible songs are:<br />Safe From Harm - incorporating a menacing, timeless bassline with incredible soul vocals and a touch of restrained but mood-perfect rapping, its a perfect album opener and a great introduction to the Massive Attack sound.<br />Five Man Army - kinda their manifesto, blends a rolling, jazzy beat with the stunningly earthy tones of Tricky, who of course went on to forge his own solo career. The way they take turns on the mic is effective.<br />Unfinished Sympathy - their classic, an enduring song that sits among the best of all time. Displays great songwriting and another top-notch vocal performance from Shara.<br />Hymn of the Big Wheel - by far Horace Andy's best vocal on the album, this song finds the right setting for his high, reggae-lite tones (his greatest vocal performance ever comes on 1 Giant Leap's 'Racing Away') and it has a great, catchy refrain which closes out the album and sticks it your mind for a long time afterwards.<br />This is not at all to say that the other tracks on the album aren't good. The other five tracks are good - some very good - but these 4 songs are the incredible songs which sum up the spectrum of Blue Lines and show it at its absolute best. The least good song on the album is probably 'One Love', which is a little disappointing after Safe From Harm, and for some reason, Horace Andy's vocals sound a little irritating on this track. <br />However, even it is good and that ita mark of how great the album is. The extent to which it pioneered can't be emphasised enough, and that alone should make it entirely seminal. Not only it is seminal by this default, but it still sounds great too.
B0000634EV|5.0|I am someone who listens to a variety of music.Admittedly ,before I heard this album,I was already a fan of Pantera, COC, Eye Hate God, and Down's first album - Nola.  I was still pleasantly surprised when I listened to it.  It is still heavy enough to keep the Pantera Fans interested, but also can get people who are fans of bands like Nazareth, Led Zeppelin, and Stevie Ray Vaughn to get hooked on this album.  It is very heavily blues oriented, but has a melodic side to it, also.  I think this is the best album to come out in a long time - thanks guys!
0385504209|5.0|I was up all night reading The DaVinci Code--Dan Brown's newest thriller is too hard to put down to let something like a good night's sleep get in the way. He manages to give art, religion and history lessons wrapped in a fast-paced mystery novel. Throw in a little Holy Grail mixed with lost gospels and faith-shaking<br />biblical conspiracy theories and it's an irresitable pull toward a satisfying conclusion.<br />I wonder if Opeis Dei has put out a fatwa on Dan Brown? If I were him, I'd keep one eye open.
B000066NW0|5.0|I thought about skipping my review of Avril Lavigne's album since over 1,300 people have already reviwed it, but I couldn't.  This is, in my opinion, the BEST debut effort by any artist in the last 25 years.  She holds true to her &quot;rocker&quot; persona through the entire album.  Her songs are well constructed and her lyrics match perfectly.  The melodies, power chords, chord changes and her razor-sharp vocals are simply unbeatable.<br />I find it offensive that Avril was shut out at the 2003 Grammy Awards.  Although I love Sheryl Crow and &quot;Steve McQueen&quot; (which won Best Female Rock Vocal), it could have easily gone to Avril.<br />This recording is, by far, superior to most of the one or two hit CDs published today.  I'm guessing this album will produce SEVEN top 10 hits much like Michael Jackson's &quot;Thriller&quot; did back in the early 80's.  Rock on Avril...you have my ears!
B00008H2LB|5.0|Damn people this CD Kicks major ...!All the songs has a great beat and an interesting beginings! LOL THIS CD IS THE BEST EVER!
B000002J09|5.0|Okay, what more can I say that hasn't been said already? I'll just repeat:<br />This is, in every aspect, the best album ever released.  There are no two ways about it, best ever.  Every song, with the exception of one, is ridiculously good.<br />Black Dog - Everyone has heard of it, not many had heard it.  Sounds awesome and has an unusually sweet beat.  Unlike any other Zeppelin song.<br />Rock and Roll - C'mon! Its called &quot;Rock and Roll!&quot; How can it be bad?  Yes it's in a car commercial and yes you didn't know it as a Led Zeppelin song, but now you do.  Now you can sound smart when the commercial comes on. ; )<br />The Battle of Evermore - Best Lord of the Rings reference next to &quot;Ramble On.&quot;  I love the tune of this song.  It just sounds like it should be in the opening credits of the movie... simply awesome.<br />Stairway to Heaven - This is where all music ends.  There isn't a person in this world that hasn't heard of this song.  It earned its reputation and it isn't a poser.  It is the perfect combination of everything... Starts out with the best guitar ever, drifts into flowing, intriguing lyrics, melts into faster, more simpler lyrics, and ends up rockin' all the way to the last line that makes you think.  I don't care what it's about, I'm just happy it exists.<br />Misty Mountain Hop - Not their best &quot;Flyin' high&quot; song, but still good.  I didn't like it the first time I listened to it; but I also didn't like &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot; the first time I listened to it.  (Okay, its not THAT good.)<br />Four Sticks - This is the only place the album fails to blow me away.  All right, so Bonham used 4 drumsticks, where's the rest of the impressiveness?<br />Going to California - Their best country/rock song.  Very low key and fast at the right moments.  Makes you feel good and makes you want to listen to it again.  I love this song; &quot;It's like butta.&quot;<br />When the Levee Breaks - Drums that rival &quot;D'yer Mak'er.&quot;  Most definitely Zeppelin's darkest song.  It pounds on and on for 7 minutes and doesn't end a second too soon.  The only bad thing about it: It's the last song on the greatest album ever released.<br />A must own for any serious music fan... period.
B00008PW3Q|5.0|Let me begin by saying that this is a brilliant collection of songs with stellar production from Lindsey Buckingham.  Lindsey has once again proven his genius as the architect of the sound that made Fleetwood Mac instantly recognizable.  Ever wonder why it took two guys to replace him and they still had no success?  I have read some of the negative review of this album (with shock and horror) and felt compelled to comment on some recurring negative themes and to defend an exception release.  Number one, the length of this album at 76 minutes.  So what!  After the delay of studio material (with the exception of two unforgettable albums), the more Mac that we can have the better.  And who ever said that an album has to be heard in one sitting?  What is wrong with a collection of 18 great pop/rock songs?  Number two, it doesn't sound like older Mac.  What? Every band should be allowed to grow.  This is very matured, sophisticated, modern music.  In fact, it does sound like some older Mac for those who liked Tusk and have heard Buckingham/Nicks.  I can also hear elements of other Mac albums as well (Stevie's delivery in Gypsy can be heard in \\"Thrown Down\\").  And I have to argue that \\"What's The World Coming To\\" and \\"Steal Your Heart Away\\" are little pop numbers from Mac of yesteryear.  Number three, Lindsey's frantic ventures.  Well, I can only say one thing about that.  Incredible!!  \\"Murrow Turning Over In His Grave\\", \\"Come\\", \\"Say Goodbye\\", and \\"Miranda\\" are phenomenal tracks.  His guitar work is impeccable--a sonic wall of sound.  And finally (and this may cause some controversy), the departure of Christine McVie.  Did she really bring that much to the table anyway?  How come they never had a substantial hit while she was in the band prior to Lindsey and Stevie joining the band?  This album is much more cohesive without her songs.  Fans of Linsey and Stevie will love this record while fans of Christine may be somewhat disappointed.  The music is a little harder and darker than other releases probably because the songs were taken for a test drive as a rock trio Buckingham/Fleetwood/McVie before adding the vocals.  Fans of Stevie will love \\"Illume\\", \\"Running Through The Garden\\", \\"Destiny Rules\\" and \\"Silver Girl\\".  Her voice sounds better than ever.  Fans of Linsey...well...you're in for a real treat, enough said.  Standout tracks:  \\"Murrow Turning Over In His Grave\\", \\"Thrown Down\\", \\"Miranda\\", \\"Peacekeeper\\" (first single), \\"Bleed To Love Her\\", \\"Everybody Finds Out\\", and \\"Say Goodbye\\".  Not a bad track on this album.  Worth the wait and every dollar and penny, so buy it!  Don't let the critics fool you.
0316666343|5.0|How unusual.  In early creative writing courses, we often had to retell a story (such as Cinderella) from the point of view of one of the characters (say, the mouse).  At the time, I thought it was silly.  But the telling of this story by the dead victim is brilliant.  And gives me hope for all of us about the &quot;Great Beyond&quot; and the &quot;Rainbows Bridge.&quot;  What a great story.  A real page turner.  Geared more to womens' feelings, than mens', I think.
0792163710|5.0|I could not stop crying at the end when Shane left and I'm 32 yrs old.  The story, the morals, the music, the scenery are touching.......<br />This is the way family movies ought to be.<br />It is simply beautiful.
B00005JLH2|3.0|Devon Miles (Nick Cannon) is a temperamental young man from the inner city who hopes that his musical talent will provide opportunities for a better future. A Southern university offers him a scholarship and a place on the drumline of their highly regarded marching band. Once in college, Devon embroils himself in a battle of egos with the drumline's leader, Sean (Leonard Roberts), and finds that his obstinance and lack of formal musical training don't sit well with the band's traditionalist director, Dr. Lee (Orlando Jones). In order for the band to  be at its best for the upcoming national marching band competition, everyone will have to set his personal feelings aside and work together.<br /><br />&#34;Drumline&#34; is a formulaic poor-boy-makes-good story, from its disenfranchised inner-city minority start to its cliche battle of the bands finish. The old story has a new setting this time though, in the world of competitive college marching bands, which makes it reasonably entertaining. The movie's biggest obstacle is that the main character isn't the least bit likable.  I hope that actor Nick Cannon's better work is ahead of him because in this movie he just does a lot of pouting and not much acting. Orlando Jones puts in a good performance as the marching band's stubbornly old-fashioned director (who reminded me so much of Jeff Goldblum, though, that it made me laugh). Zoe Saldana is appealing as Devon's love interest, Laila. The marching band sequences are good, but not great and not nearly as long as marching band numbers actually are. &#34;Drumline&#34; has a couple of good performances and band sequences in amongst the cliches, which make it worth a rental.
B000002HGD|1.0|This is a marked departure from Moby and his regular music.  If you are looking for tradiitonal Moby stay away from this CD. It is loud, a mishmash of musical instruments banging away with little listening pleasure.
B000002JKA|4.0|After their heavily prog-influenced second album, Images &amp; Words, Dream Theater took their prog-metal mix and heartily beefed up the &quot;metal&quot; factor, using crunchy, ditorted passages often powered by guitarist John Petrucci's recent discovery of the seven string. Other noticable differences include more complex bass playing John Myung and a more gravelly and deep singing voice from James LaBrie. Unfortunately, this would be DT's final album with founding keyboardist Kevin Moore, who left the band during the mixing/mastering process of Awake. DT's next album was even more metal-like, but without any interesting solos, hooks, or technicality, the album failed, whereas Awake has enough of every element to make it a well-rounded work.<BR>     The opening track, &quot;6:00&quot;, opens with a catchy drum fill, an interesting synthesizer vamp, and then slams into the albums trademark of gospelseque keyboard patches and heavily distorted guitars. &quot;Caught In A Web&quot; is a good example of how this album works. It opens with blast of strings patches from the keyboard and a metal band setting. However, if you picture this song without the ketboards, it just doesn't come across the same way. Add in intelligent lyrics and some good shouting from LaBrie and you have a great song. The standard DT instrumental is &quot;Erotomania&quot;, and is unique to &quot;Dance Of Eternity&quot; or &quot;Ytse Jam&quot; because it focuses less on technicality and more on groove and just 'jammable music'. The song sounds (and is) very fun to play. &quot;The Silent Man&quot; is a ballad, and with Dream Theater that's always a hit-or-miss prospect, but this time it works. Coming one track after another, &quot;The Mirror&quot; and &quot;Lie&quot; are undoubtedly two of the heaviest tracks the band has ever recorded. Both are basically riff after riff after riff, making a killer context for LaBrie's growls. &quot;Lifting Shadows Of A Dream&quot; is a poignant tune mostly composedby John Myung, and &quot;Scarred&quot; is a multi-faceted epic in the vein of &quot;Learning To Live&quot; from I&amp;W. The final track, the mostly piano-and-vocals &quot;Space-Dye Vest&quot; is a truly haunting track that resonates deep, despite some really bizarre lyrics. All in all, &quot;Innocence Faded&quot; is the only forgettable tune, although maybe &quot;Voices&quot; isn't that good either, since I can't think of anything to wrote about it. <BR>     Every DT album is so different from each other, that fans who've only heard Images &amp; Words may be pretty taken aback from this metal rampage. However, if you like your heavy metal bone-crunching and thought-provoking, than look no further than Awake.
B00008PW3Q|5.0|I have to laugh at the so-called Fleetwood Mac &quot;fans&quot; that are disappointed in, or altogether, dismiss &quot;Say You Will.&quot; Laughable, because they are claiming to be something they aren't. This is the most consistent &quot;Fleetwood Mac&quot; sounding album they have done since &quot;Rumours&quot; and &quot;Tusk&quot;. The fact that these cynics don't hear this is proof enough for me that they are &quot;Fleetwood Mac&quot; illiterate. Don't be swayed. This is classic Fleetwood Mac, except that they are better at their craft---songwriting, vocal performance, production, and playing---than ever! This is the Fleetwood Mac that should have been. I adored Christine Mcvie, but she wasn't the catalyst of the band, although some of their best songs were hers. But without her, the band flourishes more with it's two star singer-songwriters, Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham. The band was ALWAYS about them, and Christine's absence has given them the spotlight they should have had long ago. What an opportunity! Stevie's best song here is &quot;Illume 9-11&quot;. It is one of the MOST powerful, heavy songs she has EVER done. Don't let above reviews disuade you on this one---It is classic Stevie Nicks. There is not a dud on this opus. The craft here is sterling. I am just simply blown away by &quot;Say You Will&quot;, and urge you to take a listen. Disappointment??? Psshhhhhhh. I don't know what cd the above &quot;reviewers&quot; were listening to, but they obviously were not listening to this. Some people just can't be pleased, no matter what you do. You will be! Any intelligent person will be!
B000001E8S|4.0|I'm not sure how to classify this album.  The lads thought that it was not quite \\"U2,\\" so the Dubliners dubbed it \\"Passengers.\\"  The benefit of this is that it allows them the freedom to do things that are not commercial, but are rather artistic.  Indeed, this album is just soundtracks and background elevator music for movies.  The down side, is that they are running from themselves.  This is really U2 hiding.<br />I would have preferred this album to be called \\"U2 Soundtracks.\\"  This keeps the VERY marketable name, and keeps their musical soul together.  Many bands release a \\"B-Sides\\" albums-U2 did this with their first \\"Best of\\" album-and this album could have fit comfortably with the rest of their catalogue.  U2 tends to hide themselves (as with the \\"Million Dollar Hotel\\" soundtrack), and keeps the \\"U2\\" name pure.  Too bad.  We want the whole band to be easily recognized.<br />This album is also key for studying the band's development.  Play \\"Elvis Ate America\\" from Passengers, then \\"Miami\\" from POP.  You hear the similarities?  The band was tracing a vein of emotion, and it was finally perfected for POP.<br />The compositions work for me-\\"Blue Room,\\" \\"Beach Sequence\\" are great.  \\"Miss Srajevo\\" is sublime, and has worked its way into the U2 concert sets.<br />I suggest this album for the Hard Core U2 fans only, or for the eccentric on your Christmas list.  Other people will just not get this album musically.
B000089RVX|4.0|... <BR>I enjoy listen to great music!! I'm a music fan! I'm into everything in my opinion is good. I always tend to look for the lyrics. In my opinion the lyrics are very important, as a beginner writer myself. I like lyrics with substance, but the music is also really important. <BR>I first heard Bring me to life on the radio, and I loved it since then, I just wanted to know whose song was that. I saw it on mtv, and started to find about the group in the internet. So I decided to buy this album. Wow, it's really good!! My fave songs on this album are Going under, Bring me to life (of course!), My immortal, Tourniquet and Taking over me. The 1st time I heard my immortal, I didn't like it at all 'cause is too slow, but after listen to it more, I fell in love with the lyircs; they're so sad!!. <BR>I must say that all the songs are good, but for some reason I always skip Everybody's Fool. But there parts in some songs I would edit, like in haunted, the only thing I don't like is that it says \\"raping me\\". What's with that? And in Tourniquet at the end of the songs, it says: \\"Will I be denied? Christ! My Suicide!\\" Why my suicide?? That shouldn't be there. <BR>By the way, the front of the cd is pretty scary, too. That girl; ... I mean yeah, she got a pretty and powerful voice, but.....I don't know. My mom even told me that she looks like Marilyn Manson. I was so freaked out when she told me that, I just hide that case. I just don't want to see it again....<BR>Well, I guess there pros and cons with everything. But if you ask me, I think it's worthy to buy it!!
B00008PW3Q|1.0|I have been buying music since 1969..I own all types of cd's and love MUSIC.  This is not music.  It is a bunch of folks older than myself..and I consider myself on the verge of middle age..self indulging fantasies that they can sing and write music.  Hitting the intended note seems beyond the reach of the songs on this CD..I wasted 10$ and would love a refund. My kids asked me if the cd was broken. I long for the happy melodies iof Rumours..this one makes Tusk seem like a good idea.
0767819594|5.0|This movie is 50% wicked 50% fun and 100% entertaining!It has an awsome cast and a killer soundtrack!Its a love story made for teens filled with love suduction and betrayel!Sebastion(Ryan Phillipe)and Kathrine(Sarah M.Geller)sizzle as a pair of muliputive step siblings out to ruin the lives of others through seduction,sex,and betrayl!
B00008PW3O|5.0|I am still in the middle of listening for the first time.  First I am pleasantly surprised that I like lindsey's songs more than I thought I would, it is much more edgier and I actually like the frantic songs alot they have a great alternative/rock edge to them, really shows of his talent.  Anyway Stevie sounds great even better than Trouble In Shangri La. When I say better than I expected, I have always loved fleetwood mac, but mostly the stevie featured songs but as I said earlier I like the lindsey songs to.
B00005JLEU|4.0|This isn't a movie the way we are used to movies.  It's Alice In Wonderland-esque, granted, but it surpases it.  It doesn't have a story in which every detail is explained away until there is no mystery or wonder left in it, which would be tragic, this being a story about wonder and mystery.  It presents itself in simple, elegant and poetic form and allows you to simply accept everything as it comes.<br />The characters are strange but well-balanced and memorable.  The story is far from preachy and doesn't try to ram a moral down your throat.  It is just told.  When it's all over it will leave you in a good mood, which is the best that can be said of any story of its kind.<br />Try to watch the japanese version with english subtitles if you can.  It makes the characters, and consequently the entire story, somehow more believeable.  Enjoy.
0345448898|3.0|It's pretty interesting...Pullman has great imagination, with daemons and dust and all, but the story just don't seem to get to me. All the books seem to end tragically, the last ends pretty abruptly, and all the characters are all pretty twisted. It's kind of depressing, like there's almost no good people in the world anymore.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Music is a mix of slow, fast, and all with a fabulous message.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|this is a very good album
B00005QDW1|1.0|If you want good No Doubt, get tragic kingdom, get Tragic Kingdom(their best), get anything, but don't get this.Anyone who is new to No Doubt and listened to this cd before listening to any of their other work, will be amazed that such a band could hold out for so long.I would be to.This album shows no evidence of how great of a band they are, and what they are capable of doing.Gwen's voice is now a tiny little backround instrument, instead of the centerpiece.I don't hear the band anywhere here.Were they asleep when this was recorded.And I honestly don't know what genre this album falls into.It's not pop.Calling it rock is a disgrace.And please don't call it ska.People say, yeah, well they blend all these influences on this album.No they don't blend them.It's like throwing all these different styles into a mixer.What you get will not taste too nice.I mean have they completely lost it???This is not No Doubt by any means.And I'm all up for reinvention, but this is just ridiculous.And can someone please tell me what the hell is up with the little beeps,bleeps in the backround of practically every song??It sounds like there's an arcade in the backround!!!Their lyrics have also gotten ridiculous, and hold no meaning whatsoever, and DON'T make any sense.I can't believe that the same woman who once wrote \\"I always wanted to be a mom, sometimes, I wish for a mistake\\" on 1999's Return of Saturn, is now writing\\"Hey baby, girls say,boys say\\"!!!!I mean cmon!!!!I really loved this band, and still do.But with the exception of Platinum Blonde Life,Don't Let Me Down, and In My Head, everything else is ...!!!!!!!They used to be able to write great rock music, mix in a little folk, a littlepunk,a little ska,write great lyrics,sing it wonderfully,and make it sound fresh.They actually wrote great music too, now I see no strong melodies.I don't know what they were trying to do here, but I hope on their next album they're able to try something new without going nuts!!!If you want evidence of what a great band they are get \\"Return of Saturn\\"!!
B00003CXB4|5.0|I am in Tanzania, East Africa,  The country of Tanzania was the base for this movie.  The mountain Kilimanjaro was scene in the Movie which is the highest mountain in Africa and is in Tanzania.<BR>The wildlife like scenes are in real life here.  This movie was shown in Local Drive In cinema before the Drive in Cinema was demolished and new American Embassy built here after the old one was bombed.  See this movie in Tanzania and you will really enjoy it as all the things seen in the film are in real life here.  We have this movie on VHS and my daughter use to see this 3 times a day.  I am sure that the number will increase when it is out on DVD which I plan to get and have kept few people active for purchase of it.  Finally the words Hakuna Matata mean no worries or no trouble are of local African Swahili Language.<BR>This movie is of Lion, I send feedback to Disney to make a Tiger King or Tiger queen movie and others like it.
0788812408|4.0|I'm 15 and my friends and I still love watching this!!! The songs are really good, lol.. so if ur thinking about watching this movie and don't really wanna ponder about the movie...watch it!!
B00006RIO7|5.0|This is the greatest movie I have seen in a long time.  Hope Hollywood (or whoever) gets this message!
B00005JLWN|5.0|ohh my god this is the best movie i have ever seen, it is sorta like the matrix but it beats out the matrix like 80 billion times, literally, it is like 200 stars... out of 5 stars... the best movie i have ever seen, SEE IT!!!!
B00005YXZH|4.0|I really enjoy Wilco's style.  I have enjoed wilco's past work, but in my opinion, Yankee Hotel Foxtrot is their best.  It combines many catchy rythms and strumming patterns that are easy and pleasing to listen to (although, I found that several of the tracks were rather repetative).  The tracks that stand out to me are War on War, I'm the Man who Loves You, and Heavy Metal Drummer.  I really think that these tracks make this albumn excellent.  The production quality an creativity of the lyrics combined with the catchy vocals and rythm in this albumn have estalished it as one of the top albumn of 2002.
6305126062|5.0|this movie is so amazing, and the cast and the director is awesome.. it's really sad and extremely complex! i think most sad part is when Grace is crying over her best friend in the horse whisperer's(I forgot his name) kitchen..
B00008J4P5|5.0|So I was a little wary of getting this album at first. I've somewhat outgrown the garage taste that got me into the White Stripes. But I listened to it, and it's beautiful. I fell in love with this wonderful band all over again. I was thrilled to hear Meg sing, read Jack's lyrics, feel wonderful with a new album. The songs blend together into this unified piece, each one adding to the greatness of the last. I was suprised that this album sounded a bit more mellow than their last three. The pace is less frantic, and Jack and Meg seem to have found their niche. Lovely music with intelligent lyrics. Meg drums like she was born to do it, and Jack's guitar almost cries out at certain points. I will love this album for years to come.
B000007T1M|5.0|I thought that System's first album was really great. The lyrics were meaningful and powerful, the music very hard rock but melodic at the same time. There were only a few songs I didn't like, Soil, Suite Pee, and Mind. In these three songs, I thought that the use of the word f--k was completely random and unnecessary, they just said it to sound angry and full of testosterone, much like the average  metal band. Other than that, they are very unique.While most hard rock bands scream for death and destruction, System of a Down believes in  peace (anti-war..... you also hear that message in \\"BOOM!\\" their latest anti-war, anti-pres. bush single, on Steal this Album). There messages in their music are very powerful, and as for the actual quality of the music (guitar, vocals etc.) that's very good also. System of a Down is my favorite band, and I believe are quite revolutionary.
B000068PQ0|5.0|The Lips did it again with their album Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots.  Always a very creative band, the Lips have never dissapointed me.  I have been a fan since the release of their very innovative albumn, Zaireeka, which I really enjoyed.  The lips then impressed me greatly with Soft Bulletin.  But, I'm not here to give a review on these other albumns, the point is that I have found Yoshimi to be my personal favorite of all of the Lips albumns.  I am continually impressed with each time that I listen to it.  There is so much going on in each song, and so many different sounds and rythms to listen to, that it can be easy to focus on one part of the music throughout the whole albumn.  Again, the creativity in this albumn really impressed me with tracks like Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots Pt. 1 and 2, Do you Realize??, and Approaching Pavonis Mons By Balloon.  Overall, this albumn was extremely well put together, and is one that I will never get tired of listening to.
B00005JLEU|5.0|I would have never bought this movie, along with other movies by Hayao Miyazaki if I wasn't assured that the original Japanese language with English subtitles option was available.  Listening to the English dubbed version is painful.  Just as people make fun of badly dubbed kung-fu martial arts movies, English dubbed anime is just as bad, and I don't care what big American star provided the voice-overs.  It just isn't the same.  Therefore, three cheers to the distributors (Disney?) who decided to not cut corners and make the Japanese language versions available.  Let's hope more distributors will decide to release other Miyazaki movies not previously available, such as the Red Pig (&quot;Porco Rosso&quot;), definitely one of Miyazaki's very best, as well as re-release Totoro in the Japanese language version.  Any of the Rupan series would also be fabulous.
B00006CXXU|5.0|I think that C.A.'s cd is awesome. I went out and bought it like 2 dayz after it came out. Despite the fact that i think she decided on and INTRESTING title for this cd and the cover is a little disturbing, it doesnt impare my judgement. The music is HOTTTT and you mite just get ^ and dance  a little dirty!
6303234844|3.0|Like many of the others, I've been a PG fan for a long time, and couldn't wait to get my hands on this DVD. And, like many, I've found that it could have been much better in video quality. I suspect that the source film used in the transfer is showing it's age, or that, as some suspect, that the video 16x9 version is really just cropped from the original video master.<br />The audio is a new mix, and I'm not sure I'm fond of it yet. I will say that unless your surround system is properly calibrated, this mix will sound like .... to you. I hadn't calibrated my speakers in a while, and a couple of songs into the DVD I stopped and calibrated. HUGE difference. Much better. That being said, there are some major differences between the old mix and this one. I like some of the effects done with discreet channels, but I'm still not sold completely on this mix. I love the old mix too much.<br />This mix was done by Pete Walsh, who worked with Peter on the original mix. And although this new DVD mix really does have great moments, I don't think Pete took the time to really A/B the new mix with the old one enough. There are very significant differences in the EQ and volumes of the DVD mix tracks from the old laserdisc mix. Some song mixes sound similar, yet others are totally different. He also may have underestimated the love that so many fans have for the original mixes on SWL. It's a bit like colorizing B&W movies - it may look better but people loved them the way they looked in B&W.<br />It appears to me that this project may have been mixed and edited rather hastily. Peter has been on tour for the past six months or so, and I wouldn't be surprised if this DVD was QC'd and mixed in facilities other than Real World, which is where the original mix was done. I'm also really suspicious of the source of the video masters used for this version. Did they go back to the original film and re-transfer? Did the entire show go through a re-edit? Was the 16x9 version just cropped fromthe original footage? Did Peter and Pete both work on the DVD mix together, or was it mix by proxy? <br />All I can say is that maybe they will go back and do this one more time and do a THX-certified version or something where QC against the old version will be more a part of the process. I dunno. I love it just because it's really finally on DVD, but it is DIFFERENT.<br />BillJV
B00008DDSC|5.0|I enjoyed this unconventional love story. I think it is artfully told, the viewer gets enough information in a variety of ways (sometimes unspoken) to see how much these two people have suffered, being \\"not normal\\". Anyone who has had difficulty grappling with any part of their own inherent nature which might seem outside the norm should appreciate this movie. I am thankful that people are making movies like this, and speaking the unspoken to educate and entertain. If kinky sex or power play seem sick and disturb you, perhaps you should see this movie. If dominance and submission (in a real life sense, not a porn sense) are intriguing to you, you should definitely watch this movie.
B0000640VO|5.0|Amelie is a beautiful movie to watch, for starters.  It has vibrant colors, shapes, and tons of flashbacks and quirky moments.  This isn't a movie that's meant to look realistic.  It's like a painting, meant to extract emotion and feeling.  In this case, it works quite well.  As many say, this is indeed a very charming film.<br />The story is simple and sweet.  A young woman, who has lived in solitude but still has the ability to smile as she observes life discovers something extraodinary; a little box of treasures that belonged to the person who last lived in her appartment.  It is decades old and filled with memories.  She makes a decision to find the owner of the box.  If he is touched by this act and finds joy in his memories being returned to him, she would continue to help people and make their lives better.  He is touched, and the story takes off from there.  But there is one last question the movie asks us to consider.  Is Amelie herself happy?  She creates complicated ways of helping people, but they never meet her.  Is she really lonely and looking to improve her life as well?<br />The DVD quality is great.  Watching this movie really draws you into another world, and of course plenty of credit must go to the clear and eye pleasing quality that comes with this movie.  The extras are quite nice as well, with a collection of posters, an interview with the director, and an explanation on the unique cinematography of the the film.  Also, there seem to be issues over why the movie is rated R.  Simple.  It has scenes that depict [explicits].  All in all, these are fairly innocent and I'd recommend the film for anyone fifteen and up.  With no violence and cursing, there's little to find offensive.
B00005JLEU|5.0|Hayao Miyazaki is a giant among anime; writing, producing, and directing such films as &quot;Kiki's Delivery Service&quot;, &quot;Castle In The Sky&quot;, and &quot;Princess Mononoke&quot;.  In &quot;Spirited Away&quot;, Miyazaki shows his full potential and charms audiences both young and old.<br />&quot;Spirited Away&quot; starts with a young girl, Chihiro, moving with her family to a rural environment.  She is not happy of her family moving her away from her friends to a new school.  Her family stops at what they assume is a closed down amusement park.  Chihiro's parents find a food stand and start to eat.  Chihiro leaves them to look around the amusement park.  As the sun descends into the horizon, Chihiro frantically searches for her parents, only to find they had been transformed into pigs.<br />Chihiro later finds out that the &quot;amusement park&quot; is actually a bath house for spirits.  She is helped by a young boy with the ability to transform into a dragon.  He helps her get a job at the bath house so she will not be captured and turned into an animal.  She then has to toughen up and start working so she can try to save her parents.<br />This movie has paid large amounts of care in making every scene look true to life.  Miyazaki makes every movement of every character look as realistic as possible.  Every hair that falls, and every drop of water hitting a puddle look as if they were taken from a live action drama.  The attention to detail makes this magical tale even more believable.<br />The writing in &quot;Spirited Away&quot; is a masterpiece.  Every sly remark from Chihiro sounds as if it was straight from the mouth of a ten year old girl.  This real-to-life writing is just another piece of the perfection that is &quot;Spirited Away&quot;.<br />In conclusion, if there is any movie worthy of being purchased to be viewed multiple times and enjoyed over and over again, tis is it.
630469797X|5.0|When I first saw \\"Dawn of the Dead\\" I believe I was 17. Even at that hardened age I was frightened. I began watch more of the Romero's films, all of his \\"Dead\\" films, and branched out to the Rubinstein spin-offs, \\"Return of the Living Dead.\\" I'm not obsessed with the zombie movies, but since I was 12 years old I was trapped at a drive-in with my brother for a dusk to dawn movie run for Halloween where among other films, director Lucio Fulci's \\"Zombie\\" was playing, it changed the way I slept at night forever.<br />With Romero at the helm, the zombie's are characters rather than background and the stories are strong. When I found this version of the DVD (I have the 2 disc set) I jumped to purchase it. Unfortunately since I live in the U.S. I didn't have a DVD player that ran Region 2 movies. Once I upgraded my DVD player I wasn't disappointed by the movie. I have both versions of the film on the 2-disc set and the director's cut is by far the best film in the \\"Dead\\" series. <br />Now, because of Romero's vision, I'm always on the look out for other zombie films to scare the flesh from my bones. I recently (2003) found \\"Junk\\" from Japan and for anyone who loves zombie movies, need to check this out!

(Drew Barrymore is a little annoying as the english teacher but she did produce and bring this mavel to the screen so I let it go). <BR>To get back to my test... every and I repeat every person who could give me feedback has either loved it, adored it or gone out and purchased it (which must mean they love or adore it). <BR>For those of you who love to think and can see the pathos built into this world on a daily basis... this movie is 'It's a wonderful life' told from the viewpoint...

B00005QIPH|5.0|Hearing my first strokes song &quot;When it Started&quot; on the spiderman soundtrack i was blown away with their new fresh sound and amazing vocals. I then bought the CD and was instantly attached to all of the catchy songs and beautiful lyrics. I remember wondering if julians voice was real at first. One night while watching SNL the strokes were going to perform. Tired of listening to awesome bands performing poorly i was quite anxious to hear them. When they did play i was hooked. Julians vocals are amazing and the music is so fun. I hope to see more from the strokes and would recommend this CD. Buy it.
B000089RVX|1.0|I think I agree with the other reviewer this isn't the answer to euro goth music. And I really really agree that the Europeans have always been ten steps ahead of America musically. That is why we have so many cheezy bands over here.And I also agree that people don't know good music they just get what is fed to them on the radio! I have never seen so many people in America dependent on the radio to find music. I have played bands for people and they say I don't like this. Then the same record come on the radio repeatedly they all of a sudden get it? And alot of the eclectic bands are never imported to the U.S because of this stupidity. The U.S seems to be built on simplicity if you have to think about it, people don't like it. Goodness, TripHop is a genre of music all by it self but has never been excepted in the U.S totally. If you think \\"Evanescence\\" is good you really need to hear \\"Sneaker Pimps\\" - \\"Splinter U.K Import\\" now that is musicianship and creativity. Download a couple of cuts I suggest \\"Ten to Twenty, Half Life, Flowers & Silence, Destroying Angel and Lightning Field\\". Feel what real creative artistic music that is done with finesse is all about ! Evanescense doesn't feel evil it feels contrived at best! And a \\"Atlantis Morsette\\" interpretation at best!<br />I would even suggest \\"Queen of the Damned Sountrack\\" which runs rings around this attempt.....<br />Arish

B00001NFCY|2.0|I disliked this album almost instantly.<br />There are a few strong points.  \\"Beautiful\\" and \\"Say I\\" pack a back-to-back punch early in the CD, and \\"Faceless Man,\\" although long, adds something as well.  The rest of the album is overly cliched (if you can't see this in \\"Higher,\\" then don't bother reading my review).  \\"Higher\\" I consider the worst song on the CD; its nothing but pure unadulterated cheese.  \\"With Arms Wide Open\\" isn't great either, but at least its about his kid, so he gets a little pass - but there's much better out there.  \\"What If\\" also fails to deliver any impact, and the rest of the album is no better.<br />Creed is a hit-or-miss band.  They've released some great songs and some real bad ones.  And most of those bad ones show up on \\"Human Clay.\\"
B00000DC10|5.0|&quot;The Shape of Punk to Come&quot; is one of the most exceptional albums I've ever heard.  In fact it's more than an album, it's an experience, and a most pleasurable one at that.  To simply call it &quot;hardcore&quot; is a mistake on my part.  It's punk, it's ambient, it's jazzy, and most importantly, it's intelligent.  Refused's genre-blending is a testament to how music should be approached.  It is seamlessly produced, and each song is crafted to perfection.  In a scene that has become saturated with bands who write songs devoid of any substance or creativity, it'd be nice to see more people travel the road that Refused paved.
0316096199|4.0|When eighteen-year-old Sebold was robbed of her last ounce of normalcy, by euphemisms, reasonable doubt and blue uniforms, her counter strategy was to act like a pro. At that time and fifteen years later.  <br />The result is a testament to a sort of resilience so rare, it makes courage of any other, paper-thin.<br />Her fearless retelling of how she was brutally raped of her virginity and state of mind simultaneously lends comfort, as an anesthetic would, and leaves one with a numbing throb in the aftermath.<br />In first-person narrative that is at once disturbing and revelatory, she exposes common misconceptions about rape victims such as their purported wish to be sexually assaulted and the anonymous burden that weighs upon them like the near impossible task of acceptance, all this while battling notions of rape and picking up the pieces. <br />Through sheer grit and an eye for detail, Sebold makes it through the ordeal and lives to tell it like it was yesterday. The steely conviction with which she placed her perpetrator behind bars now translates into a tool of empowerment for readers by way of her profound insights: You save yourself or you remain unsaved.
B000069CWE|3.0|Linkin Park is my favorite band, and I'm trying to be as objective as possible.  I also in general have a strong dislike of remix albums, so I wasn't entirely enthused about the prospect of their doing a remix after one album.<br />That said, there are some great strengths and some definite misses here.<br />What's good?  \\"P5hng Me A*wy,\\" which features Stephen Richards of Taproot, is darker and in my opinion better than the original - remarkable considering \\"Pushing Me Away\\" was one of my favorites off \\"Hybrid Theory.\\"  Ditto for \\"Krwlng,\\" starring Aaron Lewis of Staind - the two brilliant vocalists play off each other beautifully.<br />The end of \\"Plc.4 Mie Haed,\\" which includes Chester screaming followed by absolutely brilliant, but sad piano, is my single favorite moment of the whole CD.  \\"Frgt/10\\" and \\"By_Myslf\\" are worth checking out as well.  I have mixed feelings on \\"1stp Klosr,\\" the original of which really just never have been remixed..this version is alright.  Finally, the flow from one song to the best is nothing short of beautiful.<br />Now for the bad.  \\"Enth E Nd\\" is one of the most disappointing things I have ever heard in my life.\\"  Putting the song over a rap beat killed the build-up of the song I loved in the original - and Motion Man is the worst rapper I've maybe ever heard.  The song is just hollow.<br />Lyrics are weaker than off HT throughout - \\"Find a place/ to feed your face\\" - awful lyrics that don't fit the vibe of the song whatsoever.  \\"Pts. Of Athrty,\\" \\"H!,\\" \\"Wth>You,\\" \\"Rnw@y,\\" and \\"My{Dsmbr\\" all don't add anything to the originals IMO, and in many cases, take away from the originals.  \\"PPr:Kut\\" is my 2nd least favorite after \\"Enth E Nd.\\"  I'm not a fan of most of the featured artists, at least one of whom can be found on every song.<br />And I really hate the song titles, especially after writing this review.<br />Overall, there are a few standout tracks.  Unfortunately, doing a remix so fast was the wrong call.  A few of the best here, and a few well-remixed songs off Meteora and a 3rd album, and I could be writing a 5-star review.  However, there is a fair amount of filler here, a rare weakness for an otherwise great band!
B00008H2LB|3.0|Linkin Park are one of those pop acts that purists are going to hate. \\"Ooh, teen angst set to rhymes and distorted metal guitars!\\", \\"Ooh, Mike Shinoda has spiky hair! How cool!\\". \\"Ok, so was that just one thirty nine minute song or an actual album\\". They have a point but even a person who doesn't even follow the cheesy and smugly corporate pop scene these days can see that Linkin Park aren't bad.<BR>This isn't revolutionary hard rock with a heady hip hop influence infused with a sense of innovation. It's beautifully produced pop-rock with strong hip hop references and a sense of good will. Why the overly decreasing Rolling Stone called LP an \\"art rock band at the core\\" is anyone's guess. But \\"Meteorta\\", the boys' second studio release, after the ten times platinum \\"Hybrid Theory\\", isn't artful. But it's hella enjoyable all the same. <br />Anyone looking for growth, maturity, or anything new. Sorry, put that bucks on groceries on instead. \\"Meteora\\" shamelessly mimics the entire formula to \\"Hybrid Theory\\" to a tee. There's times where lyrics are reused and cords are damn near identical to chords played on \\"Hybrid Theory\\". But it would be horrid if only the music wasn't so damn appealing and catchy.<br />\\"Don't Stay\\"(also known as \\"One More Step Closer\\"; this is so closely it sounds to this band's breakout hit), \\"Lying From You\\", and the bounce-inspired(yup, bounce) \\"Hit The Floor\\" are perfect for jamming to in the car too...with the windows firmly closed, that is. \\"Somewhere I Belong\\" is perfect pop fodder. Cool studio effects. Blaring guitars. Distorted beats. Mike Shinoda's cocked flow. Chester Bennington's angry-Savage Garden-member's like screaming. Substantial music? *crickets chirp* Good time pop music: LP's your guys. <br />\\"Meteroa\\" is so catchy and feel good that you might forget that you wish the guys had grown more. Maybe add some of the indie hip hop feel of their ambitious remix project, \\"Reanimation\\". Go further in '80s synth-pop. Try a more fluid ballad. That's the only thing, as well as the foaming predictability and cheesiness that mars \\"Meterora\\". Other than that is great guilty pleasure pop. <BR>The production really amps up the respect for this effort. It's great. Nice and shiny. Not much different from their star making album but hey, it gets the job done.
6305841861|5.0|This movie has one of the funniest scenes in any movie ever, the plate scene.  That scene still made me laugh the last time I saw it as much as the first.  Bruce Campbell is a good actor with comedic physical timing equal to Jim Carrey in Ace Ventura.  Plus somehow even though Campbell makes us laugh, he is as tough as nails in the role of Ash. Trust me on this buy this movie you will never be dissappointed.  The movie will make its way into your dvd player quite a few times to re-live the misfortune of a man in the wrong place at the wrong time being driven to the edge and fighting back.  No matter how funny the circumstances may be that occur, remember should we laugh at our heros pain? Answer....Yes and quite often.
B000002HPV|5.0|Let me be truthful...<BR>at first, I was not a Bjork fan at all. Everyone raved about the diminutive Icelandic wonder but I just found her to be a strange homebody whose lyrics and videos were merely bizarre daydreams. She seemed to play being a spacey kook for the hell of it. Being weird just to be weird. I never disliked Bjork but I couldn't get into her, even  if I tried. <br />Somewhere a few months ago, Bjork crept up on me and musically said, \\"Darnit, you will like me!!\\". I obliged. I'm now...as awkard as it sounds...am a Bjork fan. An artist who merges the line of avant garde and accessible. Her first two solo works(after leaving as you all should know by now, the avant-pop Iceland-based act Sugarcubes), 1993's \\"Debut\\" and 1995's \\"Post\\", were unique and strange yet still likeable. Although while they both stand as some of her acclaimed work, both were very uneven even with their admirable ambitions. Bjork seemed to try to prove her range rather than just let go. Also, more noticeable, both played into the Bjork image. A strange space cadet who had a weird, sometimes annoying voice.<BR>It might have gotten her played on MTV but it didn't show the true iconoclastic pop experimentalist that Bjork truly was. <br />\\"Homogenic\\", released in late 1997, is Bjork's final hour. Her chance to show off her range, grow as a composer, AND ruin that nagging \\"weirdo girl\\" MTV image. \\"Homogenic\\" remains Bjork's more bizarre release. Techno beats rush to the meltdown of archaic screaming(the rocking \\"Pluto\\"), swooning melodies set to a weird minimalist backdrop(\\"Unravel\\"), staccato beats with quivering vocals(the soaring \\"Hunter\\"), Russian sounding strings with stuttering beats(\\"Bacherolette\\"). But the trick to all this left field noodling is that Bjork has the gift of captivation. You are left awed and sometimes even humming afterwards. Bjork's like Alice in Wonderland. A strange yet wondrous girl who wants to take onto a land of her own. A surreal land where reality meets twisted fantasy. <br />\\"Joga\\" is simply beautiful. Nearly accapella with a beat coming in maybe, three minutes in. Strings swelling. It captures the isolation and warmth of her homeland, Iceland with that still intriguing strangeness. \\"All Is Full of Love\\" has that same feel. Mellow and exotic yet full of Bjork's undying conviction.<BR>The nearly radio friendly \\"Alarm Call\\", features syncopated production. (Fact: the beat for this song is actually featured in a woman's deodorant commercial). \\"5 Years\\" mixes early Nintendo type stomps with Bjork raging about being \\"so sick of cowards\\". Even \\"All Neon Like\\" has that same mood. Just simply yet strangely bopping to an offset beat. \\"Immature\\" finds Bjork just belting about naive she was in a past relationship. The husk in her strange yet captivating voice coming out even more. <br />\\"Homogenic\\" is what progression is. This is the first Bjork album where the starlet truly let loose instead of giving into expectations. Fueled by many well-publicized events(breakups with Tricky and Goldie; attacking a Singapore reporter; bizarre television behavior) and the pressure to shake that \\"weirdo girl\\" mystique drove Bjork to make a beautiful, scary, happy, sad, and yes...strange masterwork. \\"Homogenic\\" would be that.<BR>And also,  the many remixes were good too. One of the best of the 1990s. Still wears no age.
B00008IXAR|4.0|As far as I am concerned he could sing the phone book and it would sound great. Simply Red fills a very nice niche in today's music world and this album will not disappoint. Some songs may even become classics. Mick's voice is undoubtedly one of the best around - there can be no doubt about that.
B00005QZ7U|1.0|If you haven't seen this movie before, save yourself the effort (and the money). Just don't see it. To give you an example of how just plain STUPID this movie is, I'll tell you how the beginning goes.<BR>        A writer (Ewan Mc Gregor) sits at his typewriter in Paris (the year is 1899) writing a book. Suddenly A man wearing a ridiculous yellow costume falls through the ceiling. More people, wearing even weirder costumes, run through the door. They say they are a group of performers, and need someone to read lines for a part in a play. They take the writer upstairs to their room, where the actors quarrel over the lines for a song in their musical (which is actually the Sound of Music). Suddenly, the writer sings over the crowd, &quot;THE HILLS ARE ALIVE, WITH THE SOUND OF MUSIC!&quot;. <BR>        Okay! That's the beginning. I'm not exaggerating. In fact, the beginning is actually 100 times dumber (is that a word)! Along with this, some of the scenes will actually make you dizzy, because I think this movie was co-directed by a three-year-old. The camera goes beserk in the dancing scenes.<BR>        Sorry for my rather lengthy report, but I need to tell you! I cannot see how anybody could like this movie! I could only watch it for thirty minutes without shutting it off. This is your last warning. Hit the back button on your browser now before it is too late!
B00008PW3Q|3.0|I was among many who welcomed the release of \\"Say You Will\\", and purchased it almost automatically.  I don't admit to being the biggest Fleetwood Mac fan, but do like much of their music.  Coming off of their live reunion \\"The Dance\\", it seemed like the spark was still there to create some good music.  I also didn't worry about the departure of Christine McVie, though her contributions to the group were subtly immense.  However, after the first several listens, I find myself grasping at what this disc is about and just how well it ranks in their catalog - not to mention the music market as a whole. <br />On the very first listen, I found myself very surprised - almost dumbstruck.  The lead track seemed to have elements of that classic Fleetwood Mac sound, but it was somehow different.  Then came the Lindsay Buckingham-penned track \\"Edward Murrow Spinning In His Grave\\".  My jaw nearly hit the floor, and not in a good way.  I noted that the next track would be a Stevie Nicks composition, \\"Illume\\".  So, being a fan of her music, I figured this song would level things out.  I was wrong.  Though not as bad as the preceding track, it wasn't great either.  My reaction to the next three tracks were pretty much the same, save for \\"Miranda\\", which - while a little \\"out there\\" - was fairly enjoyable. <br />Finally I hit the title track, another Nicks composition.  Now it seemed like things had returned to some semblance of \\"normalcy\\".  The following track, \\"Peacekeeper\\", is also a good track (with the minor criticism of having a chorus that sounds way too much like Paul Simon's \\"Kodachrome\\").  The remainder of the CD, then, was very pleasant and eminently more enjoyable.  They were incorporating new elements in their songs, but they were deeply rooted in that \\"classic\\" Fleetwood Mac sound that fans through the years have enjoyed. <br />Am I suggesting thus far that they had to reproduce \\"Rumours\\" here?  Hardly.  What I am suggesting is that I appreciate their willingness to experiment a little and sound \\"fresh\\" in 2003.  However, I don't think you mess with the basic roots of what made you successful in the first place.  That's the difficulty with listening to this CD; in the second half, they accomplished this. It's just that first half that is so wildly bizarre.<br />Therein lies the problem with \\"Say You Will\\", and I think it partly stems from the fact that Lindsay Buckingham - and perhaps Stevie Nicks to some extent - had so much influence on this disc that it comes off as sounding more like one of their solo albums with the Fleetwood Mac label attached.  I can only guess that Buckingham as producer was influenced by his work on \\"Tusk\\" when he set out on this project.  Reviewers preceding me have already drawn that comparison, except that I think \\"Tusk\\" was an easier listen.  \\"Say You Will\\" is in a completely different orbit.  <br />One of my immediate pet peeves on this disc's production was the incorporation of so much synthesized pop/R&B backbeats into the songs - particularly on that first half.  When you have arguably one of the greatest rock percussionists of all time in Mick Fleetwood and one of the better bassists in John McVie, why do you drown them out amidst a \\"canned\\" beat?  It's almost the equivalent of going to watch Eric Clapton, but hearing the guitar work of some lousy, two-bit schmoe working on a street corner.  At any rate, I think this is also why I was so pleased with the second half of this disc, because the Fleetwood-McVie tandem were finally allowed to show through, exposing some great work that demonstrates they still haven't lost their talents. <br />Would the presence of Christine McVie have evened this work out?  Hard to say.  As I noted above, she was very important to the group's success, but it seemed like they could go on without her.  Besides, she did contribute to some of these tracks; if you listen hard enough, you can pick them up.  <br />I think in the end, though, Buckingham was given so much control of this effort as much to make sure it would truly be a real Fleetwood Mac effort - not the version that existed after he quit in the late-80's.  The result is more a Buckingham-Nicks effort than one by Fleetwood Mac. I think his ego is just big enough that if he didn't have a grasp of production and much of the songwriting, he wouldn't have been aboard.  That's not to say he's not a great musician; I only suggest that this project suffered because it was so dominated from all aspects by him.<br />I believe that in time the first half of this disc will grow on me, and I will probably enjoy it more than I am now.  However, having listened to it four or five times already, I am still leaning towards my first impression.  The first impression is almost everything when it comes to reviewing, and at this point - after five or six listens - I find \\"Say You Will\\" a mixed bag.  On a grade scale, I would give a D+ to tracks 1 through 6, and an A- to the remainder.<br />Overall, this is worthy of three stars.  Die-hard fans of Lindsay Buckingham (in particular) and Fleetwood Mac will likely enjoy this immensely.  The casual fan or those just discovering the band will probably have a more difficult time enjoying this one.
B000069CWE|4.0|Ordinarily, I dont even bother buying remixes of songs, thinking that if the artist counldnt get it right the first time, then why try to recycle garbage, or if the song was already great, then why destroy its integrity with some inferior recreation.  But this album was a great album, even though it seems to be an attempt to recreate classics, much like rappers today take songs from the 70's and try to resale them as thier own.  The originals will always sound better.  All they basically did with this album is make the songs sound more hip hop or more techno.  If you like the rap/rock style of music that they sort of played with on Hybrid Theory, then this album is the one for you. But if you dont really care for rap to much then you may feel alienated from about half of the album.  New songs like <BR>High Voltage and My December are decent (well, maybe not high voltage), and the crowning jewel of the album is the &quot;Crawling&quot; remix with Arron from Staind. That is absolutly the ONLY remade songs on this album that sounds better than the original.  Some of the songs that they remade like &quot;In the end&quot; and &quot;Place for My Head&quot; they never should have even thought about tampering with.  &quot;In the End&quot; was a hlaf way decent song originally, but was destroyed the most of all others here.  And after repeated listens you will find your self skipping more and more songs and thirsting for the original.  This album is best suited for parties or club mixes, or if you like the sound of heavy bass in your car stereo, as the majority of the songs are dancer and &quot;nod&quot; frienldy.  but if you are one of thoise listners who actually listen to the music and lyrics, you may listen once or twice, but rarely again after.  The original lyrics havent changed much, but the lyrics from the numerous cameos are worth checking out.  By the way the &quot;reanimated&quot; spellings of the songs are utterly ridiculous and confusing.  So have Hybrid close by.  And let hope Linkin Park never subjects us to another remix album.
B00007AJGH|5.0|\\"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\\" finally came onto a DVD release (instead of that crappy 1999 release) that is teeming with extras.<br />1) The Movie<br />Based on the book \\"Who Censored Roger Rabbit\\" (which had the characters as comic strip stars instead of cartoon ones), the film has characters Eddie Valiant (Bob Hoskins) and Roger Rabbit (voice by Charles Fleischer) hoping (no pun intended) through a murder mystery. Eddie is sent out to prove Roger's sensual wife Jessica Rabbit (voiced by Kathleen Turner) is having an affair with the owner of the Acme company. Eddie succeeds and shows Roger the pictures, which makes Roger extremely sad and jealous. The day after it turns out that Mr. Acme was hit on the head with a safe (what else?) in the Acme Warehouse the night before. It also turns out that Roger was at the Acme Warehouse around the same time! All fingers point to Roger, as he must be the one who did it because he was jealous about Mr. Acme's \\"supposed\\" fling with Jessica. The evil and supicious Judge Doom (Christopher Lloyd) wants Roger for the murder...now. He has plans to excute him a new fashion that is being used to kill toons, Dip (which turns out is made of the same elements to clean animation cels in the commentary). Roger soon turns up at Eddie's office for help. Eddie, extremely reluctant at first, starts to grow a friendship with Roger. It comes to an hilarious end in this wonderful movie, and it is the only film to find Mickey Mouse and Bugs Bunny in one scene...together...talking to each other!<br />2) The Extras<br />There are two discs: Family-Friendly and For the Enthusiast. Don't worry, the movie is on both discs. <br />The family-friendly disc has sparse features, though. It also is very easy to navigate, and this disc doesn't have a director's commentary. Basically this disc was made so even a 5 year-old could get to the movie by himself. <br />The extras on the family-friendly disc are 3 Roger Rabbit shorts, a breif 10-minute kid-friendly \\"Who Made Roger Rabbit\\", hosted by Roger himself, Charles Fleischer, and a \\"Trouble In Toontown\\" game.<br />The 3 Roger Rabbit shorts are the only reason (except for the hidden original theatrical trailer. Hint: Push down on the main menu) to pop in the disc if you're a film enthusiast and/or a Roger Rabbit fan. They all feature the same basic story: In a Maroon Cartoon, Roger has to take care of Baby Herman and ends up in wild fashion. The real treat of each of these are the endings. Shown with Disney films through 1993, the shorts are extremely well thought out, clever, and hilarious with a personal touch by Mr. Spielburg himslef. The shorts are as of follows:<br />*Tummy Trouble (1989, released with \\"Honey, I Shrunk the Kids\\") is the first animated short to be released by Disney since 1961. It was also the most expensive animated short at that time. It features Roger trying to help Baby Herman when he swallows a baby rattle. Wouldn't you know that a Roger Rabbit short helped the \\"Honey, I\\" franchise to get popular. Many Roger fans flocked to it to see the short, yet they were also pleasantly suprised to see what followed. (NOTE: Freeze-frame the part where Roger and Baby Herman are falling through the hospital floors, and they reach a bathroom. Mickey Mouse is inside one of the stalls)<br />*Roller Coaster Rabbit (1990, shown with \\"Dick Tracy\\") immediately followed, also helping \\"Dick Tracy\\" get a decent run in the box office. It features Roger and Baby Herman trying to chase a red balloon, and yes, as the title suggest, ends on a wild roller coaster ride. Did you know that Spielburg wanted this short to preceed \\"Arachnaphobia\\"?<br />*Trail Mix-Up (1993, shown with \\"A Far Off Place\\") was a big suprise to many Roger fans, as a short (this is also the last short) had not been produced and released in almost three years. It is also the first cartoon short to use computer animation, and it shows. This is defintely the best looking of the shorts, with excellent effects to keep you watching and laughing. It features Roger trying to chase Baby Herman through the forest, leading to a Splash Mountain-esque ride through a saw mill. <br />The only bad thing about the shorts is that they don't come with commentary.<br />Now, onto the \\"For the Enthusiast\\" disc, this IS the disc for film buffs. A little hard to navigate (they could've sharpened up the menu a bit), but wonderfully done. This disc features both the movie and the commentary, along with a slew of extras.<br />The commentary is great, with Robert Zemickis and others who pitched in with the film. They offer great trivia, such as the fact that Judge Doom used to be the one who shot Bambi's mother!<br />Other extras are a \\"Before and After\\" featurette, having Bob Hoskins going through Toontown...with both the final product and the original shot product with blue-screens simutaneously. Another is \\"On-Set!\\", a look at the Benny the Cab scenes before the animation. Another has puppet figures as stand-ins for the toons. <br />\\"Toontown Confindental\\" is a trivia opition that allows you to have continous trivia along with the film. \\"Behind the Ears: The Making of Who Framed Roger Rabbit\\" is an excellent 36-minute documentary that you really just need to take the time and sit for. <br />\\"The Pig-Head Sequence\\", a deleted scene is feature also here. It has Eddie snooping through Jessica's office, and Judge Doom finds out. To get back, the Judge has his weasels throw Eddie into Toontown. Eddie comes back with an animated pig head on his face. At his office, Eddie uses turpintine to get the pig head off. Now you know why Eddie wasn't wearing a shirt when Jessica came to greet him in the final film.<br />\\"Valiant Files\\" combines image gallerys with a snoop-feature. You can look through Eddie's office for images, or just use the cheat sheet if you're lazy. This has some great images and drawings, a must-see.<br />Well, that's pretty much the DVD in my words. A wonderful buy for all. The film has themes and language that a 10-12 year old could pick up and not be suitable for, but anyone with an age lower than that would not catch it. You'll be on your couch for hours, as my title says, watching this DVD...
B00008H2LB|4.0|This album is a very good album.  But i have to admit,  a lot of the songs on here are reminescent of Hybrid Theroy, particularly &quot;Numb&quot;, which sounds almost exactly like &quot;Pushing me Away&quot; (how odd that Pushing me away and Numb are the last tracks on both albums).  Even the most hip hop song on the album &quot;Nobody's Listning&quot; sounds like the song they previosly made with the X-ecutioners &quot;Its Going Down&quot; (but the flute is a interesting touch). This album does have some highlights like &quot;Breaking The Habit&quot; where they use a whole new sound altogether, and is the most unique soundng song on the album.  Also &quot;Easier to Run&quot;, &quot;Somewhere I belong&quot;, &quot;From the Inside&quot; captured my attention. If your looking for a wide wide range of lyrical topics, forget about it.  I think that only a tru linkin park fan could fully apreciate this album, being that if you liked the sound of Hybrid theroy and Reanimation, then you will like this one too, since the sound hasnt changed much.  And despite this fact, Hybrid Theory is still a waaaaay better album than this was.  With the release of thsi album, they proved that they can still put out quality music, but will probably forever live under the curse of not being able to top or even match Hybrid's success. but who knows.
B000002MJC|3.0|I know the audacity. Shallow as it may seem - they lost me on the album cover.  Previouly the most intrigueing thing about a Depech Mode album was it's cover. We began w/ what looked like a real duck in plastic wrap, and then there was the old woman chopping wheat.. the bride and groom underneeth the industrial landscape,   and the red megaphone on Music for the Masses, and then the broken rose on Violater - Songs of Faith and Devotion is the only album before or since to have Depheche Mode on the on the cover lets not do that again...
B00004XONN|5.0|the world is full of people who like realistic paintings, definable moments, and predetermined experiences. well, this record is not for those people. i am happier for having music new to this world that pulls apart human paradigms and reinvents. not since i stood before a kandinsky painting in paris have i felt such a profound, lovely, and confused sensation. Radiohead is the foodstuff of angels and science fiction. linquistically, they snap cliches in half, then utilize them to create a symphonic new language of irony and heartbreak. instead of making instrumentals a nonchalent type of background music, they shove it forward and even let it sometimes steamroll the vocals to emphasize a mood or point. i am astounded at each new album. this one being no exception. Radiohead is abstract art. check your ego and preciousness at the door. it is some of the most powerfully transcendent music i have ever heard.

B00004XOWM|3.0|As it's been said time and time again, this is Limp Bizkit's weakest album yet.  No question, Three Dollar Bill Y'all was their best blend of lyrics and metal music.  With Significant other, their lyrics stayed reasonably amiable; while their sound slowly faded.  And with this oddly-titled release, Limp Bizkit lost their edge and their greatness; as they've fallen victim to that sad, MTV-teen crowd.  There are a number of highlights within Chocolate Starfish, but many of the tracks are too similar and, seemingly, far-fetched cries for rap respect.  With that being said, I will (moreover) say I am still a Limp Bizkit fan.  Here's an (opinionated) overview of the 15 tracks:<br />1. Intro - ?/5 - obviously the name speaks for itself.  If you've heard other LP openers, you know what you're in for... nothing special, otherwise.<br />2. Hot Dog - 3.5/5 - this could have actually been an excellent song.  But the take-off of Nine Inch Nails' \\"Closer\\" and \\"The Perfect Drug\\" were both ill-advised, and, pathetic.  The lyrics (minus the chorus) are rather funny; seeing as how they use the word `fxck' over 50 times.  The edited version might be twice as funny.<br />3. My Generation - 4/5 - there's good reason this song was a single, but it's too much rap.  I like the lyrics (for the most part), and the guitar sound is probably the best heard on the CD.  But the song becomes a little annoying towards the end.<br />4. Full Nelson - 2/5 - some people like this one, others don't.  I'm one of the people who doesn't.  The lyrics are too simple and a remote cry for attention.  It's comparable to \\"I'm Broke\\", but half as good.<br />5. My Way - 3/5 - again, there's a great number of people who love this song.  It might actually be the album's most popular song, though it's certainly not the best.  Fred's voice becomes annoying midway through; as it again seems he's looking for attention.<br />6. Rollin' (Air Raid Vehicle) - 4.5/5 - it may be misguided to say this is my favorite song on the album; so I won`t.  But the rhyming and music mix is better than any other track here.  It's very catchy--throughout--which is rare for this album.  It's also much better than the rap version (track 14).<br />7. Livin' It Up - 5/5 - this song is a definite hidden gem.  People who drive in their cars listening to \\"Rollin'\\" probably don't even realize this track is better.  There are some good/humorous quotes within; including would-be girlfriend Christina Aguilera, `Fight Club', and Ben Stiller.  It's hard to say this song is the album's best, but it's very enjoyable.<br />8. The One - 1.5/5 - a very bizarre start and weak lyrics allow for this track to be one of the worst on the album.  It's a bad attempt at an extension of \\"Re-Arranged\\".<br />9. Getcha Groove On - 3/5 - wow... Xzbit's rapping makes Fred's look like garbage.  It's not that bad, but this is not Limp Bizkit's best sound.  The background music and lyrics make it somewhat enjoyable in the end.<br />10. Take A Look Around - 5/5 - although this is certainly the finest track on the record, it doesn't fit with the rest of the music.  And that's because it's from the `Mission: Impossible 2' soundtrack.  There's no question it's the best song, but it doesn't even belong here.<br />11. It'll Be OK - 1.5/5 - read what I wrote for \\"The One\\" and assume it's also for this one.<br />12. Boiler - 2/5 - I really can't understand why this song was a `single'.  There is (again) really nothing special with it.  The words could be considered smart, but the sound doesn't flow with them in a way that's at all pleasing.<br />13. Hold On - 2/5 - I have no idea why Scott Weiland decided to sing on this song.  His voice is good, but I though this was a Limp Bizkit album.  Who knows anymore?...<br />14. Rollin' (Urban Assault Vehicle) - 2.5/5 - as I've said before, this version isn't as good as the `Air Raid' mix is.  The background sounds just like \\"Getcha Groove On\\" and/or \\"N 2 Gether Now\\".  And Fred again sounds dumb nextto DMX, Redman and Method man.<br />15. Outro - ?/5 - read what I wrote for \\"Intro\\".  Dido.<br />Although Limp Bizkit gained a few million fans with this release, they certainly lost a few.  They haven't quite lost me yet, but I have definitely lost interest.  I have a hard time seeing Limp Bizkit going back to the first-rate sound that is Three Dollar Bill Y'all.  There are no songs on this album like \\"Counterfeit\\", \\"Faith\\", or even \\"Break Stuff\\".  Nevertheless it is still an enjoyable CD to listen to.  There are a few 5-star tracks (i.e. \\"Livin' It Up\\" and \\"Take A Look Around\\"), but they don't clash well with all the bad songs.  You may enjoy this album for a few weeks or maybe a month, but over time its importance will fade.  If you want flawed rap music, buy this.  If you want good guitar sound mixed with [some good] rap, then get Three Dollar Bill Y'all instead.t to DMX, Redman and Method man.<br />15. Outro - ?/5 - read what I wrote for \\"Intro\\".

B000002MJC|3.0|I know the audacity. Shallow as it may seem - they lost me on the album cover.  Previouly the most intrigueing thing about a Depech Mode album was it's cover. We began w/ what looked like a real duck in plastic wrap, and then there was the old woman chopping wheat.. the bride and groom underneeth the industrial landscape,   and the red megaphone on Music for the Masses, and then the broken rose on Violater - Songs of Faith and Devotion is the only album before or since to have Depheche Mode on the on the cover lets not do that again...
B00006RU5B|4.0|Chris Cornell and Rage musicians move toward a new territory in this album. Hearing both Soundgarden and Rage influences it's inevitable and actually something you expect. Powerful guitars from Morello, Cornell's voice taken to the limit with more insightfur lyrics. When you hear it you think that they didn't care what the fans would say. They reached my expectations.
B000001EPB|5.0|Beautiful throughout. You're instantly brought back to the excitement of the stage show (if you'd seen it... you know what I mean; if you haven't, catch it if you can) and I guarantee that Ronan Hardiman's beat will move you. This is one of my favorites next to trance instrumentals and Beethoven's Ninth.
B0000844IT|5.0|Sam Raimi is one of my favorite directors, and this is definitly one of his masterpieces. Bruce Cambell just makes it all the better. The third movie in one of the best horror/slapstick comedy movie series \\"The Evil Dead\\", Army of Darkness is very entertaining and this boomstick edition is a must have. BUY IT.
B00007ELEL|5.0|Look, I have no idea why you should take my word for this, considering that I'm going to go anonymous. Just like some other reviewers here, when I first saw this film in the theatres, it seemed amusing and quirky, with a few \\"laffs\\" here and there. But weeks later, when some friends rented it one night on home video, I stuck around to view it again...and it was just one hysterical moment after another. <br />It's like this: The first time you see it, you watch it for the story. And, in a way, the story is really only half the point. This is a film whose characters and individual scenes add up to a greater whole than the scenario itself.<br />Every time seen after that initial viewing, THE BIG LEBOWSKI puts you on the floor with the brilliant, incredibly funny script and razor-sharp directing by the Coens, along with fantastic performances by John Goodman, Steve Buscemi, Julianne Moore, John Turturro...and of course, Jeff Bridges' ultimate L.A. anti-hero, The Dude.<br />I'm in a band that tours a lot, and I've found that EVERY touring band in the world knows every line from this movie by heart. These are guys who have to watch the same movies over and over again on their buses, and fittingly, THE BIG LEBOWSKI always gets taken aboard. Just the mere utterance of \\"Shut the f**k up, Donnie,\\" can get any band laughing and quoting dozens of LEBOWSKI lines. You gotta see it.
0767830555|4.0|This movie was an excellent film with Robert De Niro in it. For all of you DeNiro fans this is his best movie he has EVER BEEN IN. BUY THIS DVD AND WATCH IT ALONE. Go to the store, buy some Goobers, then put this DVD into ur DVD player and watch it 6 times in a row, or watch it until you have memorized the script, and you can be cool like me, and be like &quot;You talkin to me&quot; and then tell all your freinds about how you stayed home alone on a friday night and watched a Robert De'Niro movie and then were shocked by the cool ending. Anyways this is a great movie and any movie fan should buy it. It falls into the drama/art house category by my terms, and is definitly a shocker that is worth every penny.
0780021150|5.0|M both made and broke Lorre's career. It made him into an international success and sent him soaring into the limelight. But it immediately type casted him; leading him into mostly villianous roles. The movie is the first film that shows police procedure. It is also the first to tackle the subject of serial killers. Lorre plays a dejected child killer who just can't \\"help himself\\".  There's a terrific scene of Lorre staring at a young girl through a store window and obviously becoming sexually charged.<br />The idea of the criminals persuing Lorre and holding a kangaroo court is a wee bit silly, but the silliness is made up for the fact that the ending monologue is terrific. Lorre's frustration, self-loathing and desperation is what stands out in the movie. All the other actors don't hold a candle.<br />This is Lang's first venture into sound and of course he does a terrific job of directing; he never shows the murders, but simply implies it. And the part of the cops walking through the streets in complete silence is damn eerie and memorable.<br />My only problem is I wish the DVD had more extras. More about Lorre, more about Lang and more film facts.<br />M should be in every movie lover's collection.<br />*another top notch Lorre film to check out is the hard to find DER VERLORENE, Lorre's first and last directing stint. Very ahead of it's time!
0156027321|4.0|It was so refreshing and enjoyable to read this book. It is not a cookie-cutter adventure thriller that comes to a predictable end. On the contrary, once it gets started, one cannot stop reading just to find out how this boy manages to escape this predicament. Along the way, the writing is humorous while tragic and managed to be both spiritual and uplifting. Even when violent, the writer avoids the macabre. And just when you think the plot is over, an alternate scenario is provided.<BR>The first part of the book is slow and rather self-righteous. However, upon reflection, Pi has every right to be.
B00008PW3Q|4.0|This is Fleetwood Mac's best album since Rumors.  Say You Will is a mix of good and bad. Of the 18 songs here, about 10 are good with  6 being exceptionally good (as good as anything they have done). It would have made a stellar 10 song, 45 minute CD. As it is, I have to dock it one star for the lesser songs here. I am use to having to skip some songs (usually Christine McVie songs) on all Fleetwood Mac albums, so this is not a disappointment.
B00008NV4I|4.0|When I first saw this movie I was a little disspointed with it.  The trailer and the fact that this was possibly the last STNG movie led me to beleive I was in for an amazing ride.  The ride was still quite good but there are a lot of familiar sights and sounds along the way.  Had I seen this movie with lower expectations it truly would have impressed me but Star Trek is a big title to live up to, even though the movies don't always do that.
0316666343|5.0|A haunting tale of a beautiful 14 year old girl who was raped and murdered by her neighbour back in the 1970s. The book is a narration done by Susie from her place up in heaven. She starts off with the fateful day she decided to take a shortcut through the cornfield, to the time she finds herself streaking up to heaven where she keeps her watch over her family. From up there, Susie proceeds to tell the lives of her family after her death and how each member coped in their own different way. She tells of emotions and feelings experienced and people's thoughts as she hears them. Heaven according to Sebold, differs for each person. It is not a large communal place, but rather individual compartments where each soul can \\"decorate\\" it to their wishes.<BR>As you read this book, you can hear Susie's ghostly voice, thats sorrow ridden, telling the tale. You can hear the regret in the words and the sadness of a child who will never get to grow up, but will remain trapped in the body of a 14 year old, never going forward nor backwards.<BR>In some ways this is not a book for all due to the fact that it deals with death and the afterlife with every turn of the page. But it is a sad, haunting tale that moves you. <BR>Despite some of the negative reviews on this site, you should pick the book up and flip through it to see a sample. There is nothing to be lost, but rather you just might gain an insight into the world of the afterlife.

B00003JRCQ|4.0|\\"Persuasion\\" is not as flashy as the some of the other Jane Austen stories that have been made into movies, but it is so rich and fulfilling to watch that it ranks up there with the best.  It is a definite must-have to round-out your Austen collection--not a waste of money by a long shot.<br />The overall mood of the film is hushed and a little brooding, but not boring in the least.  A caveat--any Austen fan will certainly endure, but non-Austen companions may not have the patience.  Try having a Jane Austen party with your most refined friends, as this one may not fly with a wood-chopping, motorcycle riding husband or boyfriend.<br />The camera angles and lighting are reminiscient of other British productions, markedly different from \\"American-made\\" films. For instance, the rooms are not always well-lit, but this is more realistic to the era of candle-lighting and actually enhances the viewers understanding of the setting.  As well, the camera techniques appear a little distracting to the average viewer, such as remaining fixed upon the actors' faces a little longer than \\"American\\" films and, but this is useful because it helps the viewer to feel what the characters are feeling.  I'd have to say that this film is shot in a method that is somewhere between a stage-play and a typical movie. <br />The costumes and settings are authentic and believable.  Every attention has been paid to period details and never does one think that it is all a hoax, I promise.  Nothing is worse than seeing a telephone pole in the background or asphalt roads when you're enjoying a period film!<br />Amanda Root, who plays the main character of Anne Elliot, is an excellent actress and is very convincing as the broken-hearted spinster whose undeserving family cruelly mistreats her. She has a unique brand of beauty and elegance and pulls off her performance impeccably. <br />As the story unfolds it seems that Anne is destined to live a lonely life forever, until someone from her past unexpectedly enters the picture.......there are some surprises, but ultimately a satisfying, semi-vengeful ending.  This one makes you think a little more about some of the cruelties of old English noble life and makes you appreciate the freedom to make our own choices in matters of love.

He saved a woman from an evil TV repairman, brought a couple together, but also attracted a strange abomination from human science. <br />I also enjoyed the metamorphisis that Nora took. At the beginning, she was so shy and not very trusting; she especially didn't trust men, but at the end of the book she was pregnant. <br />All in all, it was a very nice horror book with a nice old fashinon creature.
B00008DDXC|5.0|I don' know why, but the edit for the DVD was different from the theatrical release that I saw.  The theatrical release had a number (although not all) of the deleted scenes from the DVD included in it.  I don't know if our theatre procured a special edition release (which it has in the past), or if the decision was made to chop down the DVD release.  Either way, I do wish that they would have put the deleted scenes into the actual movie, which is very easy, and can be toggled on and off (ahh, the wonders of digital recording).  Anyway, still, it was excellent, and is highly recommended...
0688163173|5.0|Readers approach an established author with expectations. Not that there's anything wrong with that. Those expectations help keep readers familiar with the author, while recommending the author to friends and attending book signings --- all of those good things. So what does one do when a favorite author not only steps away from established characters, but also takes a familiar genre... and tinkers with it a bit, and thus transforms it into something else?<br />This is precisely what Dennis Lehane does with SHUTTER ISLAND, a book very different from what he has done in the past and also different from what others laboring mightily in the mystery and suspense idiom have done. Lehane made his bones with five novels featuring the duo of Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro. His last novel, MYSTIC RIVER, was a departure from those characters but still covered the same territory that Lehane has demonstrated an intimate familiarity with, that being modern-day, working class Boston, through the prism of the detective novel. SHUTTER ISLAND is a totally different animal.<br />SHUTTER ISLAND takes place not in 2003 but in 1954 and not in Boston but in view of it --- in Ashecliffe Hospital --- located on Shutter Island, an island with a history dating back to the Civil War. The tale is told through the eyes of U.S. Marshal Teddy Daniels, the son of a fisherman, a man whose life has been marked by tragic violence and sorrow suffered in quiet silence. When we meet Daniels, he is on his way to Ashecliffe Hospital to investigate the disappearance of Rachel Solando, one of the patients. Her disappearance is significant because Ashecliffe is not an ordinary hospital, but a treatment and holding center for the criminally insane. The island is accessible only by ferry and there is simply nowhere that Solando could have gone.<br />However, as Daniels and Chuck Aule, his newly acquired partner, begin their investigation, it is immediately apparent that all is not right. The doctors who run the hospital are not entirely cooperative, the assistant warden seems to be more obstructive than not and the warden is an enigmatic character who, within the brief period in which the reader makes his acquaintance, is quite frightening. But to say that nothing or no one on SHUTTER ISLAND is as it or they seem to be is an understatement. And when Solando reappears as suddenly as she vanished, it is a signal that the mystery is only beginning. But SHUTTER ISLAND is more, far more, than a mystery novel. The last chapter of this book will cause you to read it again and again, and then reread the entire novel. All is revealed, yet all remains obscure.<br />SHUTTER ISLAND is a genre-bending novel that is as absorbing a book as you are likely to read this year, combining the best elements of Agatha Christie, Eric Ambler, Philip K. Dick and Dennis Lehane. Readers will be discussing this novel --- and its ultimate revelation --- for quite some time.

B00005JLWN|3.0|Equilibrium is basically a hash of famous orwellian inspired movies and books. Yet it falls short of any of those famous works. <BR>In the future people are mandated to take drugs that supress emotions. In this emotionless society, most crimes are eliminated, however, rebels exist underground, as there were rebels in Farenheit 451.<BR>To enforce all the rules of law there is a small group of gun totting Ninja policemen called 'Clerics'. Christian Bale happens to be the best Cleric there is. His acting performance is probably the best amongst the cast, which is not saying much. Although he certainly does do a respectable job with what he was given.<BR>Even those who are willing to forgive this movie of its numerous flaws, like me, may not be able to the ensuing laughter that occurs after the cheesy scenes.<BR>One scene is where Christian Bale realizes that there is something wrong with the society he lives in when the clerics try to kill a group of puppies. Puppies? Trust me it was as silly as it sounds. <BR>Asides from that another flaw was simply that many of the characters would oddly display emotions at times. Even though they were supposedly on drugs. <BR>The action scenes on the other hand were what made this film. Some of the kung fu was truly incredible. However, it was also problematic. In the Matrix it was explained how they could fight in such a manner, however, in this film ppl are fight similarly for no good reason. It just seems odd. <BR>Equilibrium just ends up being a run of the mill Sci Fi flick with good special effects. Definetly not even close to the great Sci Fi films ( not matrix ), such as 2001, Bladerunner, and Gattacca.<br />Asides from all the problems, the action is definetly a huge saving grace.  Has you have probably heard it does feature some amazing fight scenes, however, the were quite short and not enough.  Bale also does a good job, and along with his acting, the score, there is moodiness to the film too.  In the end I ended up getting the DVD, just because of the mindless fun.  <br />Aslong as you know to expect self indulgent mindless actioner, you might be pleasantly surprised.
B000058T5E|5.0|Jeff Beck's hammering, dive-bomber solos are still among the best in rock. The best examples of this are 'Earthquake' and 'Dirty Mind.' 'Roy's Toy,' the album's groove oriented dance track, also features a noteworthy solo and a riff to match.<br />He creates an emotional and beautiful image in 'Nadia'. The song possesses a sensual legato technique and a melody that will make you melt in ecstasy. The emotion he portrays in his playing will bring you out of your body, and Beck seems to really put a lot of himself into You Had It Coming, and 'Nadia' especially. No track is emotionless here.<br />This is not only Beck's most daring album in a career delineated by ground-breaking releases, it also contains some of his best playing yet. If Beck decides to take another long sabbatical, You Had It Coming has given fans further proof that Jeff Beck is always worth the wait.
0743424425|4.0|In my opinion, The Shining is a great book, and it will continue to impress the readers of tomorrow. King has written a classic for all time in The Shining. It all starts with Danny, a child blessed with the Shining. The Shining is kinda like a sixth sense. Things can be sensed, and people can communicate with their minds. It all starts with Danny's father getting a job at the Overlook Hotel. He is to watch over the creepy hotel for the winter. A murder, and a suicide haunt the hotel. Soon, a bunch of creepy events start to plague the family staying at the hotel. A hornet's nest, bombed and dead, regenerates hornets that sting Danny, or Doc. Doc ventures up later on to the room of the lady that committed suicide in the bathtub. While he mutters that everything is a dream, count to ten, and the dream will disappear, the woman's disgusting looking corpse rises out of the bathtub and hurts Doc. Doc runs downstairs with scratches on him, and red marks. The mother, thinking that the father has beat Doc up, tries to keep Doc sheltered. The family situation starts to go downhill until the end of the book. Many other scenes of weirdness happpens, and Doc, fearing for his life, calls the cook of the hotel via the Shining. He starts from Florida and goes all the way to Colorado, where the hotel is.<BR>Doc's father meanwhile, is starting to lose his sanity, and wants to basically kill his family and fall into favor with the spirits of the hotel. The father grows worse and worse, until the end of the book, where he hurts the Mother, and starts after Doc too. The cook arrives and tries to help but gets hurt as well. The father chases after Doc and regains some of his sense and tells Doc to run, then the Dad rebels against the spirits of the hotel and blows it up, with the family escaping with the cook. The book needs a sequel however. I'd personally love to read the next one. If there is a sequel, then I'm an idiot, but I really want this story to continue on.
B000058T5E|5.0|'You Had It Coming' finds Jeff Beck continuing his evolution towards guitar nirvana. This time out, he stays current in style, adding synth-drums and samples - - but the flash guitarwork is never smothered in the technology. A must-have for fans of Beck (meaning anyone who's ever dug rock-guitar, as it's difficult to find a recorded rock solo after 1969 not influenced by either Beck, Hendrix, or Van Halen.)The master is back, and not a moment too soon! Mr Beck never rests. All one can do is laugh, cry, and just shake your head in wonder of the Master's latest. Tone amazingly growling, thundering, crying from his Strat &amp; Marshall, he creates a new feel for each tune. Loose Cannon is just that in a turkish whammy bar melody. Get this and enjoy YHIC, getting blown away by his boldness and power.

B00006LPK5|3.0|I wish we could still go to the movies and watch one or two &quot;B&quot; pictures before seeing the main feature. Going to the cinema would be a lot more enjoyable then. It would also mean that movies like REIGN OF FIRE would get a fair shake.<br />REIGN OF FIRE is an extended &quot;B&quot; picture. Pure and simple. The movie isn't a superdriven &quot;A&quot; film intended to bring in lots and lots of cash (though that would have been nice). No, the picture was made as a throwback to the types of action shorts that used to be shown before the main picture. However, instead of swashbucklers, pirates, and Flash Gordon; we are presented with the tail of dragonslayers living in a world after nuclear destruction where dragons rule the Earth.<br />Sure the plot is thin, the dialogue cheesy, and the scenery corny. That's what B pictures look like. If you don't believe that, watch the film and play close attention. This is best illustrated in one of my favorite scenes in the movie. The two leaders of a band of humans living in rural England not too far from London entertain the children of the castle by acting out a story. The story they act out is from STAR WARS. STAR WARS! Get it? The movie is filled with such whimsical devices and if one pays attention to them, one gains an appreciation for what REIGN OF FIRE truly is:  a modern day &quot;B&quot; picture; a movie great for watching before an &quot;A&quot; picture such as RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK. However, if nothing else, the movie is worth watching for the dragons. True they are few and far between, but they are lifelike and rather menacing.

B00000JGEI|5.0|Most sequels are imperfect remakes of the originals that they were based upon. However, (and not including trilogies), once in awhile a sequel is made that is worthy of its predecessor. TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY is such a movie.<br />The original movie is a great piece of science fiction action cinema. T2 follows the story about a decade where the original ended. The original Terminator, the T-800, that Skynet had first sent back into time had failed to eliminate Sarah Connor before her son was born. However, a backup plan had already been thought of and the massive computer sent another Terminator, the T-1000 (an experimental model) further ahead into time to terminate John Connor before he reached maturity. However, the human resistance had their game on and sent another protector back in time, too. This time a Terminator would be a guardian.<br />Over a decade since it's original theatrical release, it is amazing how fresh and current T2 looks and feels. The action is intense, the special effects are state of the art, and the acting quite believable. The movie is full of allegorical allusions and subtle visuals that speak volumes. For example, as my brother pointed out, it's kind of frightening that T2 warns about machines taking over the world, yet we live in a society where many are totally dependent upon machines to do their bidding for them. Have machines already taken over and we just don't realize it? Not many sci-fi action pictures can make a person think that deeply.

My boook club was reading it and I had considered skipping that night. However, the blurbs on the inside convinced me to give it a try.<BR>I am so glad that I did. I read it in one sitting. Fuller's book haunted me. Her description of the imperialistic and racist attitudes of her parents was deeply frightening to me as the book took place in the 1970's and the 1980's. Yes we all know of British colonial attitudes in India and the Raj and the like-but that seemed so far away, so pre-World War II. In this book, you realize that such attitudes are barely a decade away.<BR>In addition, Fuller made you feel the landscape of Africa. I couldn't live there-I doubt that I would have survived a year of her childhood. Yet as she writes and writes about the aching beauty of the land, you realize that for some people, no other continent will ever suffice.

I have no problem with that, all my favorite bands do the same.  Linkin just need to either rethink their lyrical perspective, or write better lyrics.  The amount of deja-vu present in these songs is way too evident to ignore.  One can't listen to Somewhere I Belong without thinking of In the End.  But as with their first cd, the hooks are here.  Especially the choruses which exhibit some nice loud in-key screaming by Chester.  This album is different in a few ways though, first of all the angst level, while it is high, it isn't so blatantly off-the-charts like Hybrid Theory's angst-du-jour &quot;One Step Closer&quot; with its SHUT UP bridge.  Which still makes me laugh.  It seems more mellow, which suits them...  The thing is, they intrigue me, they seem handcuffed by their fans, well at least to me.  They seem to be happy writing their own brand of pop, nothing wrong with it.  I just hope they go off the track with the next one, I want to see what they sound like when they aren't mad.
B000002LKF|5.0|Like seemingly half the world, I fell in love with \\"Graceland\\" upon its release in 1986.  I wore out the cassette of that album and then heard that Paul was traveling to South America for his next project.  Would it be as amazing and groundbreaking as his previous record?  \\"The Rhythm of the Saints\\" didn't set the world on fire like its predecessor, but I believe it just might be more amazing than \\"Graceland.\\"  There are other reviewers of this album who seemingly agree with me.  That assessment is not meant to take anything away from \\"Graceland,\\" which was a deserved smash.  It's just that I find myself listening almost exclusively to this album many years later.  This album seems like a precursor to the amazing bossa nova revival of today (Bebel Gilberto and the rest of the amazing Six Degrees Records artists).  I think it's the fact that Brazilian percussion moves me like nothing else on this planet.  This percussion sounds even more amazing when combined with lyrical genius of Paul Simon.  \\"Can't Run But\\" is probably the best hybrid of lyrics and percussion (that ascending melody!!!!!), but the album is uniformly strong with no misstep anywhere.  Put on the headphones and get ready for a lifetime of listening enjoyment that has sadly already been forgotten about by most music fans.  Oh well, it's their loss!
0060537639|5.0|This book engages the reader in one of the most exciting and amazing searches for the truth in history that I have ever read.  The author draws one into the very methods he uses to untangle the mysteries of pre-colombian settlements and artifacts throuought the world and weaves the fabric of the great Chinese treasure ships into an extremely plausible historic interpretation.  It makes the reader eager to turn each page with a sense of anticipation and wonder that continues throughout the book.  1421 is a must for anyone who considers themselves educated.
B00008MNYS|5.0|I have all of Robbie's albums and this is his best one yet.  This CD has something for everyone whether you like pop, rock, or R&amp;B. It is an amazing CD because he uses so many genres of music.  No one will be disappointed if they purchase this CD because they will find at least one song that they absolutely love.  After listening to this CD, you will find out why the rest of the world loves him and see what America has missed for so many years.  I have been a fan of Robbie Williams for five years.  Both loyal fans and new fans of Robbie Williams will love this CD because it showcases his talents as a songwriter and musician.  If you purchase Escapology, you will not be disappointed.
B000069CWE|5.0|This may seem a little strange that linkin park made a remix album right after there first cd but its really worth it. All the songs on this album are excellent and they don't sound like the originals plus there are about 3 new songs on it too that wern't relased before. There is though a lot more rap on this than the first but that dosen't take away from the linkin park sound. The intro to the cd sound like something off of \\"lord of the rings\\"<BR>I have bought both hybrid and reanimation and both of the cds are worth getting. My favorite track on this is \\"Plc.4 Mie Haed\\" parts of it sound like something off the matrix or something.

B000067CPX|5.0|Now I aint much of a Chili Peppers fan but this album is musically amazing.  They seem to combine many different types of music all to fit into their own style. I would definitely recomend this album to anybody who likes any kind of music. Their released songs, By The Way, The Zepher Song, and Can't Stop, are good but the rest are just as good if not better. Venice Queen, my favorite, is beautifully done with 2 seperate parts that intrigue you and bring you into the Romance he writes about. I consider all their songs to be beautiful and poetically funky.
B00006LJ72|5.0|This is a great for fans who are just now getting into Enya's music.The set has her basic starter CD's.I personaly love it becaouse I just started to listen to her music.If you're looking for wonderful soft music and like to relax while working .Then this is for you,but if you know most of Enya's music then don't get it.
B00005JLEU|5.0|Just wanted to throw in my 2-cents worth. This anime is everything evrybody else says it is: intriging, exciting, and wildly imaginative. I took my 7-yr old step-daughter to see this at the theatre with the hope it would fire her imagination and show her something ultimately different from the animated drivel that is produced here in the US (ironically by Disney, of whom distributed Spirited Away for American audiences).<br />Just a few of the scenes/characters of note that displayed wild imagination:<BR> Kamaji the boiler-keeper of the many arms, Yubaba the witch as she transformed into her hunting persona, the mysterious No-Face, the stink god and his glorious transformation at the spa-house, the flying killer paper dolls, the radish spirit, the 3 rolling grunting green heads, the shadow-folk riding the train, and so many more that are too numerous to mention.<br />This anime will ignite the imagination in a young mind like no other that I can think of. Do your kids a favor and let them them savor this in all it's imaginative glory.
B00008PW3Q|5.0|Fans of the classic sound of Fleetwood Mac will love Say You Will. This new album, while remaining true to that timeless Mac style, pushes many envelopes and is at the same time very different from what a casual fan might expect. Harder and edgier songs like &quot;Murrow Turning Over in His Grave&quot;, &quot;Come&quot;, and &quot;Smile At You&quot; are testaments to the band's ability to take their music to a different level. The album also contains such classic, sweet tunes like &quot;Bleed to Love Her&quot;, &quot;Thrown Down&quot;, and &quot;Goodbye Baby&quot; that Fleetwood Mac has come to be known for.

B00008J4P5|5.0|I haven't written a review on here in a while, perhaps because there haven't been an overwhelming amount of things to get excited over. A lot of people hail the whole &quot;garage rock&quot; thing, or whatever other tag line is being applied to it, as the latest deal, and I think a lot of it is good, but let's be realistic the Strokes are pretty overrated. Don't get me wrong, they're really good, but I think we are all flipping our lids because we might not have heard something that &quot;different' or &quot;stylish&quot; in a while so we rush towards them like a duck to bread, gobbling up whatever's available. I think if you took away the PR, and publicity around the band they wouldn't be quite THE STROKES so much as just a good rock n' roll band who is doing their thing. In any case, I think we've piled too much meaning on things that haven't proven themselves, Hives incl. <BR>Then of course we get to the White Stripes. A brother and sister? or is it a divorced couple? Really, it doesn't matter, because there music is beyond anything i'm capable of finding an adjective for but would point you to most of the writing in here that uses a lot of words like &quot;primal&quot; &quot;ferocity&quot; and &quot;pure&quot;. At first listen i didn't &quot;get it&quot; right away, having been a huge fan of White Blood Cells, I listened to it more and more and then it just all broke through in my mind. Its simple FUN, straightforward, HONEST ROCK N'ROLL, that doesn't require you to sit and brood and be alone with the record. Tap your toe, sing the choruses, hum the &quot;bass line&quot; in Seven Nation Army. This is music you can enjoy wholeheartedly, and not have to feel you are somehow lesser cool for liking them. Of course you will have your rock critic snobs, who will have a variety of angles, but really this album is watertight. I don't see how it could be anything but a five star album. When you listen to the album, just listen. Don't think or worry about what it means, just sit down with it for a little while and if somehow you don't like this album, you should check your pulse and pupil dilation because you're probably not breathing. Oh yeh, and don't get hung up on the whole red and white gig that Jack and Meg White have going, they are just having fun, which is the whole point. FUN.
B000005HFH|5.0|Oh my God... I never thought this CD was THAT good.<br />I bought it and I had in mind that it was just another Chet Baker CD with an OK selection, since I haven´t heard some of the tracks. But I found out I was wrong, really wrong.<br />Chet Baker as a trumpet player may sound like any other, like Miles Davis or Marsalis. But what a difference a voice makes... his voice is like a rendezvous to paradise. I can´t even count how many times I´ve been enchanted by his satin voice. I fell in love by the first time I heard him, a few years ago. And indeed is a soundtrack for a lazy winter day :)<br />Beautiful romantic selection, good for die-hard fans and newbies.

B00005K3OT|3.0|I am beginning to fear the pre- emptive titles 'a film by Lasse Halstrom' more and more as he issues forth such lightweight niceties as 'Chocolat' and 'The Shipping News'. True the film is gorgeously shot, and obvioulsy warmly regarded by those involved in its production, but this film borders on simplistic naivety, coming on like an anaemic, charmless, witless version of 'Amelie' through characterisations (such as the mayor) that are way to broad and crudely sketched and caricatured to be anywhere close to enamouring. Through a few tepid patches in the narrative, the film generates a high 'oh get on with it' quotient. All this is redeemed somewhat by Binoche and especially Olin's performances, their luminance enough to acrry the film through most of its moribund patches.
B000089RVX|5.0|Okay, so I'm into ska and punk mostly.  But this CD is awesome.  I wouldn't compare it to Linkin Park, since \\"Bring me to life\\" isn't charactistic of the rest of the album.  Amy has some great vocals, and I think that she makes the album.  She could sing anything and I would like it.  The music has a kind of modern rock/gothic feel to it, but then again the tracks have good variety throughout the album.  \\"My Imortal\\" and \\"Hello\\" showcase excellent piano/strings work and sound like they could be on someone else's CD(like a classical CD)- but the lyrics and tone of the song somehow fit the CD very well.  There is even a choir on \\"My Imaginary\\".  I personally like \\"Going Under\\" and \\"Tourniquet\\", but all the songs are good.  I listened to this CD probably 10 times in the first two days I owned it.<br />Amy's vocals are rich, powerful, and haunting.  I like the band Garbage because of Shirley Manson, and I'd have to say that Amy blows her away.  It should also be noted that her \\"best friend\\" is her guitarrist Ben: he does an excellent job on fusing rock with some of the other elements that come together in their music.  This stuff is great to crank up.  I can't recommend it any more highly.

In fact, I've never written one of these reviews before but was so enthralled by this story that I couldn't help myself.

B000000W8C|3.0|You can't listen to \\"A Northern Soul\\" without comparing it to The Verve's stunning 1993 offering, [[ASIN:B000000WJK A Storm in Heaven]], or, for that matter, with [[ASIN:B000000WF0 Urban Hymns]] from 1997. While \\"A Northern Soul\\" does contain the same windy, psychadelic vibe of its predecessor and succeeding album in spots, the sound is not quite as special. \\"A New Decade\\" and \\"This is Music,\\" two triumphant, blustery songs lead off \\"A Northern Soul,\\" and things look promising. The following ballad, \\"On Your Own,\\" is nice enough, and leans toward the elegant style of some of the songs on \\"Urban Hymn.\\" Still, it lacks something. \\"A Northern Soul\\" misses the originality of \\"A Storm in Heaven,\\" and doesn't reach the tuneful, ambitious heights of the last Verve CD. The songs are a little plainer on \\"A Northern Soul\\", not quite as grabbing.<br /><br />Nonetheless, the guitar work by Nick McCabe on this album is pretty impressive. Like the songs on \\"A Storm in Heaven,\\" there's a huge, atmospheric swell of guitars all over the place. And when \\"A Northern Soul\\" rocks out, it's probably the rawest guitar record The Verve ever made in their unfortunately too-short career. Feelings of severe loneliness pervade the lyrics of these songs, while the music goes back and forth from a big rock sound to a slower, more muddled slew of tracks that don't really stand out toward the end of the CD.<br /><br />\\"A Northern Soul\\" hits a good stride midway through, however. The album's title track is Verve psychadelia at its finest, as is the purposely over-the-top and perfectly named \\"Brainstorm Interlude,\\" with its indecipherable lyrics, funky beat and wayward sound. Unfortunately, though, the back half of the record falters a bit: Songs like \\"Drive You Home,\\" \\"History\\" and \\"Life's an Ocean\\" are pleasant enough, but also a tad boring. I prefer the big guitar sound of the great \\"No Knock on My Door,\\" but that's just my preference.<br /><br />It should be noted that these guys owe a debt to the Smashing Pumpkins on their last tune (interlude), which is a guitar-drenched jam highly reminiscent of the Pumpkins' 1992 work on the song \\"Drown\\" from the [[ASIN:B0000028MA Singles: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack]]. The wailing guitar by McCabe may not be quite as fierce as what Billy Corgan did back then, but the mesmerizing drum and bass featured in each song have very similar sounds. The whole vibe between the two great songs is similar in style, and there's nothing wrong with that. As the Pumpkins probably owe a debt to Jimmy Hendrix for what they did on \\"Drown,\\" the Verve can thank the Pumpkins for helping pave the way for gloriously guitar-drenched tunes.<br /><br />Even when The Verve hit a somewhat average-sounding snag in their songwriting process, the band still tops most bands that are out there. The Verve's ability to use the studio as another instrument to further the depth of their unique sound is admirable; most bands don't bother to experiment so much. Overall, this is a sprawling record that takes several spins to appreciate. Think of The Verve as a psychadelic Oasis with a little more soul.s on their last tune (interlude), which is a guitar-drenched jam highly reminiscent of the Pumpkins' 1992 work on the song \\"Drown\\" from the [[ASIN:B0000028MA Singles: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack]].

B000002H2H|5.0|This album, possibly Metallica's best melts down an alloy of sheer brute force, unsurpassed musical skill, and exemplary writing into an amazing brand of metal. From the start Metallica shows that they can do an even speedier song than anything on Kill Em' All with \\"Fight Fire with Fire.\\" As this song and most others on the album explore the theme of dying in various ways, it's no surprise that there would be a song about suicide. But \\"Fade to Black\\" is a stunning slow tempo song, and it's real thoughtful - I like it! Other classics on hand include an Ancient Egyptian tale; \\"Creeping Death,\\" and death from the perspective of an occupant of an electric chair; \\"Ride the Lightning.\\" But if you really must know there aren't any weak tracks. No track even approaches weakness. Sure, at first i didn't like \\"Escpae\\" or \\"trapped under Ice\\" but they grow on me. All in all a fantabulous album, if you're a fan of heavy rock consider this indispensable.
B000002HEP|5.0|After purchasing \\"Blues for the Red Sun\\", Kyuss' second album, they have been without question my favorite band of all time. While Kyuss was never a very radio-friendly band, their work is simply unmatched. If you listen to a Kyuss album and are searching for that catchy hook that your typical radio band has, forget it. Kyuss' music is all about feeling and emotion. It's not music that you can just throw in your CD player while you are busy doing other things. Kyuss needs to be appreciated and taken in. If you wish to fully experience Kyuss, sit in a dark room with your headphones on, close your eyes, and be blown away. Although the music carries the stoner rock label and does have a psycadelic feel, you don't need any kind of a buzz to enjoy Kyuss. The MUSIC is the drug. \\"Welcome to Sky Valley\\" is an absolutely excellent piece of work. However, it's only a fraction of the Kyuss experience. I don't recommend buying \\"Welcome to Sky Valley.\\" I recommend buying EVERY album this band has recorded. Although I enjoy their first record, \\"Wretch\\", it truthfully comes nowhere near their later work. It's really cool to see the band progress and mature musically with each record. I was crushed when this band broke up and my only hope is that someday they join forces again to create the best music ever made.
B00004Y6O9|5.0|Van Halen's debut album is one of such high quality, that if I graded it song by song, I'd end up giving them all an A range grade.<BR>    Van Halen is an unprecedented, electrifying assault. Starting with the amazing anthem \\"Runnin' with the Devil,\\" and ending with the tense \\"On Fire,\\" the band doesn't include one weak track. What the VH crew does manage to include is some of the most durable, raw, guitar-tastic, and infectious hard rock of the decade. In a word: Awesome.

B000069KGM|5.0|&quot;Chicago Transit Authority&quot; is an amazing achievement for the group Chicago for many reasons. When it was recorded in 1968, the group was given two weeks to lay down all of the tracks. For four album sides worth of material!<BR>The performances, considering the pressure they must have been under in their first studio experience are just astounding.<BR>And of course there is the music, which when it emerged in 1969 was like nothing else before it; and nothing like it came after.  Radio staples like &quot;Does Anybody Really Know What Time It Is?&quot; and &quot;Beginnings&quot; still sound great because the music just doesn't fit any &quot;category&quot;. It's pop; it's rock; a little jazzy; terrific melodies and great vocal harmonies; lots of feel. <BR>The CD opener, &quot;Introduction&quot;, is a perfect showcase for the band and a preview what lies ahead on the rest of the tracks. Great horns, terrific drumming by Danny Seraphine, and Terry Kath's unique blues-rock guitar.<BR>Kath goes on to dominate this recording, with solos on almost every tune and long jam stretches highlighting his improvising skills. Instrumentals &quot;Poem 58&quot; and &quot;Liberation&quot; remain classics in this vein, while &quot;Listen&quot;, &quot;I'm a Man&quot; and &quot;South California Purples&quot; are bluesy songs with some great Kath guitar placed within. <BR>The dominance of Terry Kath on this album is my only criticism. For the record, I am NOT criticisng Terry's playing. I dig every note.  But,although many call this the &quot;greatest&quot; Chicago record because it has the most edge, since it does not find the group really branching out in different directions yet and highlighting each and every members' talents like on Chicago II or VII, it is really not the best document of this truly eclectic band.<BR>I hate to admit it, but &quot;Free Form Guitar&quot; which, if it had been a minute long or so would have been fine, but I've been skipping past this track for years as it's just tedious.<BR>A true high point which shows Chicago at it's best with vocalists Robert Lamm and Peter Cetera sharing the lead duties and the horns really blowing is &quot;Someday&quot;.  Political rumblings aside, this is just a great tune. <BR>Although this record finds producer James William Guercio still experimenting with mixing (the horns are put to one side), the overall sound is very live, which adds to the timelessness of this disc.  <BR>&quot;Chicago Transit Authority&quot; burst onto the music scene after Blood Sweat and Tears had released a couple of recordings and other &quot;one hit wonders&quot; such as the Buckinghams were using horns in a popular format, but anyone listening to Chicago's first release knew that this was something really new and innovative.<BR>BS&amp;T were great, but they were bascially a jazz band mixing in some pop angles.  Chicago was a true rock band, with a top notch guitarist, three great vocalists and a really unique horn section with it's own personality, feel and sound. And of course, the songwriting: cutting-edge, high quality and truly fresh.   <BR>After &quot;Chicago Transit Authority&quot;, Chicago left all &quot;horn rock&quot; bands in the dust, and for obvious reasons.<BR>This is a &quot;must have&quot; disc for anyone interested in Chicago, or, seeking out all important early rock recordings.
B000059QY2|5.0|Rigoletto is one of my absolute favorite operas, and this DVD version made it even better!<br />The cast is perfect, at least when it comes to singing, but I just can't stop LAUGHING at Edita Gruberova's infernal gestures and behaviour... Maybe Gilda is supposed to be a bit stupid and naive, but Gruberova's playing is almost parodic.<br />  But it's not any worse than that it makes you laugh.<br />I have no complains to the rest of the movie. Wixell is just as good as an actor as a singer, and I don't think Pavarotti acts too bad either. But anyway, you forget his bad acting when you can hear him sing!
B000069KE0|5.0|Their first album &quot;Chicago Transit Authority&quot;, may have put them on the musical map, but Chicago's second album shows this legendary band defining their rock-jazz style.  &quot;CTA&quot; was a groundbreaker in so many ways: Terry Kath's dominant hard rock guitar work,  the blazing horns weaving into the mix of each song in a way that had never been heard before,  elements of rock, jazz, and R&amp;B blended so uniquely and three distinctly different and talented lead vocalists creating an electrifying listening experience. <BR>&quot;Chicago II&quot; just doesn't expand on this approach or even take it one step further, with this album, Chicago seemed to go light years into new musical ground.<BR>&quot;Movin' In&quot; opens the disc with a powerhouse Big Band style that grabs the listener and the band never let's go. Terry Kath, though less prominant than on &quot;CTA&quot; carries out some of his best guitar  work with the classic &quot;25 or 6 to 4&quot; , &quot;It better End Soon&quot; suite, and &quot;In the Country&quot;.  The &quot;Ballet for a Girl In Buchanan&quot; suite  highlights two top ten classics: &quot;Make Me Smile&quot; (more amazing solo guitar work by Kath) and &quot;Colour My World&quot; both sung by Terry with his trademark R&amp;B baritone.  Sinfully melodic songs such as &quot;Wake Up Sunshine&quot; and &quot;Fancy Colours&quot; stick to your ear long after the disc ends.  Chicago explores a bit of orchestral style with &quot;AM/PM Mourning&quot; with intense strings and some Big band ballad textures.<BR>The CD closes with Peter Cetera's first written song for Chicago &quot;Where Do We Go From Here?&quot;.  A simple tune in style and arrangement that foreshadows Peter's incredibly melodic writing contributions to this amazing band for years to come.   <BR>In a nutshell, the horn and vocal arrangements on this CD display Chicago at their best and the songwriting is incredibly strong and diverse. <BR>If you are looking to explore the eclectic musical catalogue that Chicago has amassed over several decades, this is the CD is a must as it evidences their defining moment.
B00008H2LE|5.0|To me, Meteora is a great follow-up to Hybrid Theory. (Unlike Reanimation, which was way too out there) This album shows the real Linkin Park by using lots of different types of music. This is what I think of each of the tracks.<br />01 Foreword 10/10- A good intro, nice and short and gets right to the music.<br />02 Don't Stay 10/10- A perfect song to start the album with, has great guitar riffs and vocals by Chester Bennington. The best song on the whole album.<br />03 Somewhere I Belong 9/10- The first single of Meteora, which is all in all a great song with great lyrics.<br />04 Lying From You 9/10- A good song to come after Somewhere I Belong, it has a good beat and good riffs.<br />05 Hit The Floor 10/10- A very catchy song with really really good guitar riffs. It has good rhymes from Mike Shinoda and great vocals from Chester. Second best song on the album.<br />06 Easier To Run 10/10- This song sounds quite similar to Crawling, especially how it starts off, but this song has more vocals from Mike. Even though, its a great song with powerful vocals.<br />07 Faint 10/10- This song has a very unique touch, an orchestra used as part of the beat. It makes it sound very different than any other rock songs that i have heard before. This is on of the most unique songs on the album, and also one of the best.<br />08 Figure .09 8/10- Typical Linkin Park song, sounds a lot like their old stuff.<br />09 Breaking The Habit 8/10- This electronica song is new for Linkin Park. At first, I would ignore this song since I was looking more for guitar riffs but after awhile I started to like it. It has a great vocals from Chester.<br />10 From The Inside 10/10- This has good guitar riffs and great lyrics. A great song from Linkin Park.<br />11 Nobody's Listening 9/10- A complete hip hop song, another new thing from Linkin Park. (Excluding Reanimation) It has really great chorus and lyrics, I especially like the guitar riffs during the chorus.<br />12 Session 5/10- This song sounds a lot like A Cure For The Itch, which was a song I didn't like. I personally dont like this song since hip hop intrumentals aren't my thing.<br />13 Numb 9/10- A great song to end the album, just like Pushing Me Away was for Hybrid Theory.
B00003CXXP|2.0|One thing I would like to comment on, is the fact that this film was touted as being the project that Stanley Kubrick wanted to make before his death. And after watching AI, I would safely say that with Speilberg it turned out to be less 2001 and more ET and Pinnochio,less thought provoking masterpiece as I suspect it would have turned out to be from a genuis like Kubrick, and more sentimental dribble that a very talented director like Speilberg finds himself trapped in lately.<BR>Is Speilberg overrated? I don't think so, for films like  Duel,Jaws and Colour Purple(in my opinion his best film to date and a cinematic masterpiece) demonstrates a very able and talented artist, yet he seems to have lost it lately. <BR>Haley Joel Osment as the robot kid with human emotions is one of the best child actors around today, and delivers his role flawlessly. Jude Law is also one of the best Brit exports today, an actor with immense capabilites..Yet what I have problems with is the script which seems to be lost between sentimentality and epic scale science fiction. The marriage of these two is very delicate and the right balance should have been found, given the subject matter, which alas was not found here.<BR>Speilberg's direction seems uneven, the first half being the more coherent, the second a bit lost.<BR>Yet the DVD itself is of top quality and full of extras to satisfy any digital afficiando.<BR>A disappointing film on all counts, and a lost opportunity to film and understand Kubrick's vision, by a director that I know can make much better movies, if only he sheds the excessive sentimentality that has become a staple of his moveimaking of late.
B00005QEO1|5.0|This is one of their best albums. I totally enjoyed it.
B00005QXDD|3.0|Ok first off Jack Black's music sounds like a drunken version of songs from Uriah Heep, Dio, Blind Guardian, Manowar, Hammerfall, Helloween, and Primal Fear and that is why I like it.  However I can't pull myself to give this neither 4 stars nor 5 stars.  It's on par a good comedy album but if I really wanted insane comical power metal or comical metal I'll go with the bloodletting of Gwar.  Good try Jack I look forward to your next album though.  Through in some songs about bodily dismemberment and I'm yours dude.
0792844882|5.0|Showgirls is really good. Don't watch it thinking about what you have read about it, go into it with an open mind. The dvd includes the making of. Showgirls is not a comedy. If you buy this get the NC-17 version.I ordered the dvd, and am waiting for it to get here. I mailed the check yesterday. I have already seen the film, though.
6305350205|4.0|First time I saw this film I didn't care much for it. But watching it again, some ideas began to emerge. To me, this film is primarily about friendship, and the bonds that exist between Kirk, Spock, and McCoy.<BR>Although not the best of the movie series, this film contains one of the best scenes in all of Star Trek: that of Kirk questioning &quot;God&quot;. &quot;Why does God need a Starship?&quot;
B00005Q4CS|3.0|Well, I honestly didn't know what this movie was.  I bought the DVD as a blind purchase.  I was expecting a horror film from the my limited knowledge from user forums.<br />My wife and I watched the movie in silence.  I think we both pretty much had the same experience.  It was mesmorizing and yet had little or no worth as a story.<br />At the end of it all, its a drug abusers nightmare really.  All the cliche problems occur to a set of friends/family all in one large overdose.<br />Did I like the story? No, not really.  Did I like, would I recommend the movie?  Yes.  I enjoyed it from start to finish and when I look back at why that might be, I come up with this recommendation..<br />The angles of filming (body cams) and look of this film is superb. The entire \\"Mother\\" part of the film is awesome.  The acting in general is very convincing.  <br />While I didn't really like the story, that's not what I remember most.  I remember the fridge, the clicking jaw, the paranoid eyes and the destroyed arm.<br />This is one of those few movies, that at the end, I sat and stared at the t.v., watching the credits go by.<br />When I think about it, I give it 3 stars.  I can't put my finger on where the other 2 stars went.  Probably deserves at least one more.
B00005K3O4|5.0|This is a cool movie. I rented it now i want to buy it!
B000008H24|5.0|I definitely agree with the spotlight reviewer on why so many Tull fans hate War Child. I go one step further and state that this album is one of Tull's best.  In fact, I think it is the best Tull album post-Thick As A Brick.  It is not as brilliant as Aqualung, Stand Up, and Benefit, but it is more solid than Too Old..., Songs From the Wood, Heavy Horses, etc.  I became a Tull fan in the late 1980s, and purchased their back catalogue in the order in which I found their records, not by chronology (A Passion Play being the last I bought).  I, therefore, had no expectations when I put on War Child.  I liked it when I first heard it and, unlike other albums, I like it more today than then.  It has a folk sound, but not a woodsy sound like Songs From the Wood and Heavy Horses.  It has a folk sound that might be appropriate on a old sailing ship setting off to find riches for jolly ol' England.  It is also more solid than their later albums.  Usually Tull albums have a song or two I skip or do not enjoy very much.  I can play War Child straight through.  It is a real pleasure to listen to. The only time I cringe is<BR>                     during the last part of the otherwise soothing ballad &quot;Ladies&quot;.<br />Besides this one complaint, the rest of the tracks are amazing. The heavy use of accordion and tracks like &quot;Queen and Country&quot; and &quot;The Third Hoorah&quot; gives the album a sea expedition theme. &quot;Bungle in the Jungle,&quot; the most familiar track, may be a little too commercial but is still a fun number and probably attracted new fans (is that so terrible?). &quot;Skating Away&quot; is beautiful and so is &quot;Only Solitaire&quot; if you don't pay attention to the crude lyrics. &quot;Back-Door Angels&quot; and &quot;Sea Lion&quot; hook together to make a wonderful 9:00 theatrical number. &quot;Two Fingers&quot; is a version of &quot;Lick Your Fingers Clean&quot; which is on the boxed 20th anniversary set and is highlighted by excellent acoustic guitar. War Child is also the last album where you hear Ian Anderson's low, smooth voice. It begins to get a little higher on Minstrel in the Gallery and definitely changes by Songs From the Wood. My advice is to not listen to disgruntled Tull fans who dismiss this record as a &quot;sell out&quot;.  Besides &quot;Bungle&quot;, nothing else on this album is outwardly commercial.  &quot;Skating&quot; may be the more accessible of the other tracks but it does not sound like a sappy ploy for radio play. Grab a copy and find out for yourself.
B000088E6D|5.0|My girlfriends have raved about this Michael Bubl and his sound. I now will admit, they are right. Best songs: Come Fly With Me, Moon dance, You'll never Find, kissing a fool  - actually EVERy song on the album have become fav's.
B000002MUN|5.0|As a huge Tom Petty fan, I find the statement for this album, &quot;Tom Petty is like a Beatle immitating Bob Dylan,&quot; a huge understatement and insult to Petty's maturing music repetoire.  After all, this album did win a Grammy the year it was released.  The album is beautiful, especially with the use of a full orchestra on certain tracks.  It is naive to assume that the music of a true artist will stay stagnant through time, or that without the Heartbreakers' accompanyment, Petty will not come up with something completely original and unique from their sound.  This is my favorite Petty album produced so far.  It is absolutely flawless.
B000002I2I|5.0|The Doors make yet another classic hard rock album here. They were getting pressured by new groups like Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, and the revamped Mach II Deep Purple. The Doors started moving away from the acid rock sound into bluesy hard rock in the vein of mid 70's Stones. Morrison is at his peak, and his lower voice is a nice change of pace from the other shreiking hard rock singers of his day... Check out this album, you can't lose.
B00004X0Q0|5.0|Some bands achieve greatness with time, some get it when they first start out, and some never achieve it all. At The Drive-In achieved greatness the first time they stepped onto a stage. They fall into that very small category of bands that will kick your ... every time they come out with something, no matter how strange or weird it is. This record should have been my generation's \\"Nevermind,\\" but instead, people chose to ignore it and listen to more predictable and boring music. Even if you hate punk or even hard rock music in general, you have to hand it to ATDI for not boring you. Every song on this CD is relentless, and no matter how hard you try to get away, it pulls you in. Even the slow songs, \\"Invalid Litter Dept.\\", \\"Quarantined\\", and \\"Non-Zero Possibility\\" don't make you want to skip them over. Every song on this record is there for some purpose, some reason for life, and ATDI uses every chance they have to make the song great. The first 4 songs on the CD are just hardcore punk rock, with fast drumming, killer riffs, and everything you would ever want in a great album. \\"One Armed Scissor,\\" the song that should have brought them to stardom, is quite possibly the best song recorded in this new millenium. Some may beg to differ, but I think this album was the best thing recorded in the 00s, (QOSTA's Songs For The Deaf being second). The rest of the album includes it's climatic 6 minute epic, \\"Invalid Litter Dept.\\", along with a song with Iggy Pop!! I mean, how great is that?!?! After a killer (and I mean KILLER) opening with \\"Arcarsenal\\", they end it slowly but beautifully with the intense \\"Non-Zero Possiblity.\\" And every track in between is perfect. Seriously, you can't get any better with this CD. As you all probably know, At The Drive-In sadly broke up right before they could have been huge. Of course, after that their record label (the Beastie Boys' Grand Royal) went bust, and they all went their seperate ways. Or did they?? Jim, Tony, and Paul (guitar, bass, and drums) went and formed their own band, Sparta, which kicks major ... I must say. I've seen them twice, I know. And Cedric and Omar (lead singer and lead guitar) formed a band called The Mars Volta. This band is weird, but at the same time extremely great! It sounds a lot what ATDI might have done if they hadn't had broken up. Or maybe it's just Cedric's voice... Either way, ATDI is over, and two great bands came out of the ashes. But, neither band (even though I love them both) will never equal the greatness reached on this album (or on Acrobatic Tenement, in/CASINO/out, or Vaya) and that's OK. No band in a long time has impressed and amazed me as much as this little punk band out of El Paso, TX. Just take my advice, and buy this CD, then buy the rest of the ATDI catalog, and then go out and buy Sparta's new CD and Mars Volta's EP (new CD coming in summer)! Oh, by the way...the title of my review comes from track one on this CD!
B000088E6D|5.0|i loved this wonderful c.d. by a new and young talent.  it is so refreshing that in this day of  music that an artist can really sing.  I was blown away by a voice that reminds me of the music of years gone by.   What a beautiful choice of songs and what a fantastic orchestra.  Even though some songs were not what i would have chosen, he sells them and I  have now come to love them all.  I really recommend this enchanting disc.
B00006RINF|5.0|Now with Evanescanes (or however you spell that band's name) I think Lacuna Coil shadows them 10 fold. These guys make some beautiful music. GO out and buy Comalies now... this a great album and the female vocalist does it all. Nice touch of guitars here and there as well. The male's vocals doesn't do it for me. Perhaps it would be better if he stuck to more of an aggressive growl or something like on Angel's Punishment. Next month I get to see these guys with my SISTER who isn't crazy about metal music. Also my 5 year old Daughter LOVES Entwined, Heaven's a Lie, and The Ghost Woman and the Hunter. Great Album, I look forward to future works from these guys (and gal).
B000059TEP|5.0|Ghost is a magical movie. The top grossing film of 1990 is also one of the best movies of the decade, no question. Here is a rare film that can be watched over and over and still make the viewer feel the same emotion every time--you wanna laugh and cry all at once. The film combines elements of almost every film genre--fantasy, ghost story, mystery, horror, romance, drama, thriller, and comedy blend together seamlessly for a touching, emotional, and suspenseful roller coaster ride.<br />Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore are fantastic and Whoopi Goldberg definitely deserves that Oscar for her hilarious supporting role as psychic Oda Mae Brown. She successfully brings a light touch to an otherwise dark and brooding film.<br />Directing his first film on his own, Jerry Zucker (who was partnered with his brother David and Jim Abrahams on the Airplane! movies and other spoofs) has done an impressive job, with considerable help from a brilliant editor, Walter Murch, and Oscar winning screenplay by Bruce Joel Rubin. <br />Rubin has crafted a well-paced and entertaining tale. He is a born storyteller, with a gift for weaving an intricate, involving narrative as well as an ability to tap into some of our deepest hopes and fears. What makes Ghost special is the way it takes what might have been an unbearably sentimental story and turns it into a powerfully romantic drama with a positive message about life, death and love. He manages to make us feel a flurry of emotions while we stare dumbfounded at the unbelievable events unfolding before us, making them extremely plausible. He sucks us into the tightly knit tale from the very first frame, and doesn't let go until the end credits begin to roll. <br />Ghost WILL make you believe.
B000069HKH|4.0|First I`d like to say that I was thrilled when I heard The Boss was getting back to the studios with the E-Street band. My parents ... have got me hooked with both The River and Born in the USA albums. They told me, and I always listen to my parents when it comes to music, that his solo performances never came close to the albums he made with the E-Street band. So for a couple of years I only listened to the Boss' older work, and was very, VERY happy with that. <br />My hopes for a new Springsteen hit went sky high with the release of The Rising. I figured that the Springsteen and E-Street combination has been good for so many hits, why would that be different this time? I became more suspicious when the Rising was labelled as a tribute after 9/11. I was afraid of a way too patriottic and sentimental album.<br />Those fears haven`t totally become reality. The Rising is patriottic and sentimental, but not too much. The only downside of the 9/11 theme is the down beat of the album. I think the Boss as well as the E-Street band is at his best when he really rocks, in his really upbeat songs. And those songs are hard to find on The Rising. This is logical, but all the same a pity....
B00005JLEU|5.0|Okay I'm alittle biased. I love Hiyao Miyazaki. He's a genius. I've loved his work since My neibor Totoro. This wonderfull movie will keep you jaw open staring at the screen. It's wonderfull. If you haven't seen his other movies i suggest strongly that you find a friend,rent them, buy them whatever you gotta do. But watch this one first. Then go back....wow
B00008PW3Q|2.0|I have been a big fan of all of the Fleetwood Mac lineups for 30hmmm...something years. One of the good things about their repertoire is that there is an album to satisfy any mood. From the raw and bluesy era of Peter Green, the slightly more progressive sound of the Bob Welch era, the laid back beautifully blended sounds of the early introduction of Stevie and Lindsey to the painfully honed hi-tech production of the current lineup...sans Christine McVie. I own a copy of the Buckingham Nicks album which I am also very fond of and have the utmost respect for Lindsey, both as a musician and a producer. My favorite Mac album isn't &quot;Rumours&quot; like most other Fleetwood Mac fans, but &quot;Fleetwood Mac&quot;, where Lindsey's focus was on playing and songwriting before he became obsessed with crafting the perfect sound in production. Considering Lindsey's comment on &quot;The Dance&quot; regarding a solo album in progress, it's my guess that &quot;Say You Will&quot; is that very album with Stevie, Mick and John along for the ride and the Fleetwood Mac name along for the revenue. Christine's absence leaves a gaping hole in the music. Her classicly catchy, upbeat, keyboard oriented tunes are conspicuously missing from this recording. I completely understand her wanting to be out from under the weight of the band and touring but I just wish they could reach some sort of compromise to keep her influence. Perhaps she could just like, email her offerings or something. If my hunch is wrong about this being Lindsey's long awaited solo album and the band really did have an equal part in the making of it then it's my opinion that either Lindsey's really not a very good team player or the rest of the band simply hadn't much to contribute. Stevie contributed some good things and should be given her due credit but on the whole, &quot;Say You Will&quot; screams of Lindsey. I would give this a 5 star rating as a Lindsey Buckingham album, but it's not. This is Lindsey Buckinghamat his all-time best, <BR>but Fleetwood Mac...hmmm...you'd better decide for yourself.
0060934700|4.0|(but I gave it four stars for the poems, which I could really live without)<br />The stories, however, are absolutely wonderful, &quot;The Price&quot; in particular (especially if you are a cat person)--it is about a cat that protects its adopted home from... well, from something. &quot;Snow Glass Apples&quot; is sick, of course, but what do you expect from a retelling of one of the sickest fairy-tales of all? Another wonderful one is &quot;We can get them for you wholesale,&quot; where the Old Firm from the Neverwhere fame shows up again!<br />This book held me riveted--I could not put it down.
B00006AW2G|5.0|This album came out when I was 13, which was sort of a perfect age to hear it, and I've always thought of it as one of the Stone's best.  This is the Stones in full storm, really coming into their own as a band.  Yes, their earlier albums from their R&B/Soul period are great, \\"Exile\\" is more harrowing and artsy, \\"Beggars Banquet\\" is more in your face, and \\"Sticky Fingers\\" is better produced.  But Let it Bleed is loose, diverse, and fun.  Everything from almost pure country to menacing rock to Keith Richard's best vocal performance on \\"You Got the Silver\\" (his later output is just as heartfelt, but his vocal chords were in better shape at this point).<br />As for the sound quality, this is a really good excuse to go buy a SACD player (I nabbed a nice one by Sony for only about $...-- from Amazon, as a matter of fact). I thought the CD layer on this disk was a big improvement over the original CD release (what wouldn't be?), but for whatever reason it was marred in spots by overmodulation distortion on the guitar -- that needles in your ears sound you get when someone pushes the meters too far into the red.  The SACD layer, by contrast, is absolutely stunning.  The only thing I can compare it to is listening to original master tapes, which I got to do now and then in a former life.
B000001IQH|5.0|I don't listen to as much punk as I used to, but this albulm is still one of my all time favorites.  I believe it is their best.  The songs on it have good beats and are catchy.  Maybe that is why some &quot;hard core punks&quot; don't like it as much, it isn't all thrash and screaming.  I believe this cd shows so much of thier talent.  I totally recommend it.
B00006JL1Z|4.0|It is no secret that the lineup with Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham was the most successful line-up in the US, and if you bought the first 'Greatest Hits' package, you got most of the big hits that most remember. If you purchased either the lengthy box set or the 2 disc set of 'The Chain,' then you got most of the hits, plus very little material from their pre-'Rumours' years. Or if you got 'The Dance,' then you got all the hits redone live. Now what the people don't think about is that this particular hits collection was a prelude to their new release, as it was touted in the TV promos and the sticker on the cover, and is suppose to be a definitive collection. This is everything but a definitive collection. From the sequencing, to the bewildering tracklist, and the feeling that you didn't get all that was deserved. <BR>     The obvious is that it does include most all of the singles that were released, with the exception of 'Fireflies,' 'The Farmer's Daughter,' 'Save Me,' 'Hard Feelings,' 'Oh Diane,' and anything released after 1990 save 'Paper Doll.' The album also excludes anything before 1975, where you miss songs like 'Hypnotized' (which has won awards for consistent airplay), and 'Black Magic Woman' (a hit for Santana). Not that all of these were big hits, but they were the best their albums had to offer. The exclusion of these singles were to make room for 'What Makes You Think You're The One,' 'Gold Dust Woman' and 'Storms,' which aren't bad songs, but don't deserve to be alongside a hits collection if they weren't pulled out of their respective albums as singles. If one thinks this is petty, imagine what the UK was subjected to. They had the most bewildering tracklist of all, having cuts from 1967-1969 along side tracks from 1975-1990, completely avoiding 1970-1974. <BR>     The addition of single mixes were nice, such as the mixes for 'Rhiannon' and 'Over My Head' but what about 'Say You Love Me,' 'Gypsy,' 'Big Love' (the latter came as a remix). Notthat they were sorely missed, but at least it would have kept consistent with what was trying to be accomplished.     Definitive? No, absolutely not. Enjoyable? Well, yes. This is a good place to start for those who want an overview of what the 'Mac Attack' is all about, but for other than casual fans, this is a wasted opportunity caused by record company greed.

B000031WD9|2.0|When I first saw &quot;American Pie&quot;, it was automatically one of my favorite movies. It was taboo, exciting, raunchy, and all-around hilarious. It had a lot of great elements to it. Good cast, pretty original plot, and a funny script. This movie pretty much blossomed all of the actor's careers who were in it. <br />After a few years though, I watch the movie again, and some of my feelings toward it change. It was still funny, the cast was still good; but some things disturbed me. &quot;American Pie&quot; is considered one of the best TEEN movies ever. It is an R rated movie (and appropriately so) that is extremely explicit and was geared specifically toward teenagers. Many 11, 12, 13, and 14 years olds love this movie. Is it right that they even saw it? Maybe not, but thanks to the marketing for the movie, they were the ones who made up the majority of viewers. What bothers me the most, however, is how it started up a whole new line of movies. Explicit, raunchy, movies all geared toward teens. <br />Although it's still a good movie, I would enjoy it a lot more and could sleep better at night if it was either geared to more of the adult audience, or they toned the material down a bit.
B00004UFYU|5.0|Hi there.  I live in Australia and heard this cd whilst having a massage in a game park health spa!  so I hunted the Cd down.  cannot get it in Oz.  Its haionting musaic and beautiful voices.  I recommend it to any one with a decent music system in their car on the open road and let it rip!!
0783240287|5.0|I know people complain of Maria Friedman, but it's still goood because she at least gets the facial expressions right. Although the shortest proffesional musical I've ever seen, it's one of the best I've seen. Donny Osmond is the perfect Joseph, and I love the cast in GO GO GO Joseph. Worth buying, especially the dvd for its DTS capabilities.
B00005JLSE|5.0|This film moves at breakneck speed, sucking in the viewer from the start with Zeta-Jones terrific opening number.  Richard Gere singing and dancing?  Yeah and what a performance!  Queen Latifah surprises (at least she surprised me) with a sexy number early on, too.<br />Great cast: John Reilly as a believable, downtrodden Amos Hall.  Renee Zwelleger romps as Roxie Hart, rising out of the ashes of a murder charge.  Zeta-Jones is the sexiest of all dancing up a storm early on, then bringing down the house along with Zwelleger in a closing number that shines.<br />Rob Marshall's direction at first appeared too heavy handed but really rolled with the prison sequences and the courtroom action.  It's a roller coaster ride of a musical under his direction and, just like a roller coaster, the film is over before you know it, leaving you shaking and breathless and ready for more.  Time to see it again!
B000056NX5|4.0|First of all, I LOVE LOVE LOVE Jesus Christ, SUperstar. It is my FAVE MUSICAL EVERRRRRRR! When I heard they're making another version of it for video i had to buy this. First of all the acting and singing was great. I particulary like Judas because he does sound like he's going insane with fear. The only real problem is high-feminine voices of Jesus and modern-day New York don't mix. But buy it anyway.
B00007H1Y2|4.0|A playful instrumental collaboration between roots music avatar Ry Cooder and Cuban guitarist Manuel Galban, of the early 1960s doowop/pop/son ensemble, Los Zafiros.  It took me a while to warm to this record, but when I did I was won over... It's a fun, spirited collabration, and Cooder and Galban obviously got a real kick out of working together.  It did seem, however, like territory that's already been covered in recent years -- rock-tinged. latin-dance-y, neo-exotica, as heard in the work of bands such as The Friends Of Dean Martinez, Marc Ribot, et al. Still, Ry's a master of world pop, a trailblazer who was touching on this material decades ago, and he still has a masterful touch.  Longtime fans and devotees-by-way-of-Buena Vista alike will not be disappointed.
B00007FOMP|5.0|The title says it all.  One of the very last Motown albums to be recorded in Detroit, before Berry Gordy took the label to LA.  Perhaps the saddest of all music deaths was the night back in 1984 when I heard on my car radio that Marvin was shot by, of all people, his father.  His dad, a Reverend, a man of GOD.  Marvin dedicated this album to the man who would kill him 13 years later.  <BR>This is probably the most haunting piece of music from the 20th Century, and therefore it is truly timeless.  That's why it will always sound as if it were recorded last night.  I can't listen to the title track without tears.  Neither can you.
B00000K19E|5.0|I am a big movie fan, but unfortunately I missed the Matrix in theaters.  I saw it once it came out on video, and the instant I finished it I watched it again.  And again.  It has a mind-bending story, which does take a few viewings to get the whole thing, but the Matrix made that good, and it has AMAZING special effects, which might be the best part.  I congratulate John Gaeta who did the special effects for it.  I have watched the Matrix over 20 times now, and it is never boring when I watch it. There is always something new to find out in the plot every time you watch it.  If you like the Terminators, the Mission Impossibles, or Minority Report, you will love the Matrix.  Like director Andy Wachowski said, &quot;It's about Kung Fu vs. Robots.&quot;
B000068QY7|5.0|I have been an Oasis fan since 1996. I had been meaning to buy Heathen Chemistry for months before I finally did myself the favor. What was I waiting for? On the first listen I decided that it really doesn't get any better. The &quot;Hindu Times&quot; is a guitar masterpiece that had me wanting to dance in a second or two. They say the guitar work sounds like George Harrison. Like a Sitar possibly. My other favorite songs are &quot;Songbird&quot; and &quot;She Is Love&quot;. These love songs may send one looking for a hankie. So, while the bad boys are still hard rocking, they are also mellowing out with some romantic ballads on this very fine CD. Excellent songwriting and musicanship are the hallmarks of Oasis. This album will not dissapoint.
0792836634|3.0|These movies are okay I guess, although I prefered them when I was 12. I think the movie is kind of funny, They were never scarry to me, I dont know, just something about dolls infront of a camera and crew just doesnt send chills up my spine...
B000068QY7|5.0|I have been an Oasis fan since 1996. I had been meaning to buy Heathen Chemistry for months before I finally did myself the favor. What was I waiting for? On the first listen I decided that it really doesn't get any better. The &quot;Hindu Times&quot; is a guitar masterpiece that had me wanting to dance in a second or two. They say the guitar work sounds like George Harrison. Like a Sitar possibly. My other favorite songs are &quot;Songbird&quot; and &quot;She Is Love&quot;. These love songs may send one looking for a hankie. So, while the bad boys are still hard rocking, they are also mellowing out with some romantic ballads on this very fine CD. Excellent songwriting and musicanship are the hallmarks of Oasis. This album will not dissapoint.
B00005T33W|5.0|This movie has got way halarious parts! I loved it because it seems a lot like me and my best friend, and  a lot of the things in the movie and here where I live are halariously similar, this is one of my favorite movies!
B00005K3NR|5.0|An awesome thriller that should not be missed. Better than Buffy the Vampire Slayer!<br />Marry me, Carrie!<br />(I mean it, you any of you readers out there know of such a<br /> cute gal, I'd love to marry her!)
B00005JLH2|5.0|Before this movie came out I was thinking that they should have a movie out about band. This movie is great, I defenately think band members would like it. I think you probably need to like marching bands to really enjoy this movie because its entirely about a marching band and theres almost always band and drumline music playing.  There are several longer scenes of the band performing. The choreography is amazing and I love the drum music. Its a great movie!!!
B000060P79|1.0|It's almost impossible to believe there are already 3 singles taken from this album. This is a real joke... I'm just a kid ? Act your age, man ! This band is like every other band that came out before it (similar sounding I mean, like Blink 182, Good Charlotte, New Found Glory...), only it's not as good.<br />There are so many lines taken from previous records it's not even funny... In I'm Just a Kid there's a line that goes : &quot;wide awake I'm bored...&quot; Treble Charger (a similar sounding band) has a record called Wide Awake Bored. Hey, I realize this doesn't really mean anything, I'm just saying. Simple Plan has a song called When I'm With You. Ultimate Fakebook (a similar sounding band) has a song called When I'm With You, I'm ok. Hey, it may be coincidence, I'm just saying. Simple Plan has a song called Addicted. Lit (kind of a similar sounding band) has a song called Addicted. Hey, I'm just saying.<br />Ok, on a more serious note, every band I named in this review (except Simple Plan) is worth checking out. Every of their albums are better than this one. Please, before you decide to buy this one, do a little research. Compared to this, you probably won't go wrong. Two things before I finish. One : yes, God must hate you. Two : yes, grow up.
0780631684|5.0|It's about time they made a good teen horror movie.  A good cast with an original premise makes for an enjoyable thriller.  Finally the killer isn't some deranged psycho that is too predictable like scream or i know what you did last summer (two movie franchises that suck by the way) In this film death itself is the taker.  Cool special effects and death scenes.  I can't wait for the sequal
B00006RU5B|4.0|When you merge a heavy group with a aspiring new age group you never know what to expect. With Audioslave you get a beter new age group, and horrible heavy material - with exceptions. That is the case with the majority of their first effort as a band. Soft songs like \\"I Am The Highway,\\" \\"Like A Stone\\" \\"The Last Remaining Light\\" and \\"Shadow on the Sun\\" are masterpieces. They blend everything of light new music that works. It is like the new Incubus with a spice of rage (bad pun alert) and country flavor for good measure. However, in my personal opinion, when they resort to mindless yelling the album goes south for the winter. Many songs like \\"Set It Off,\\" and \\"Show Me How To Live\\" (poor 3rd single choice, if rumors are true) are mindless rockers that don't inspire anything but pressing the skip button. I know that they are similar to Rage Against the Machine, but their day in the sun is past and it is time to move on. \\"Cochise\\" and \\"Gasoline\\" are the exceptions to this rule, having a great control and funky beats. <br />Audioslave should have a better second album if they choose to move in one direction - a soft feel with hints of heavy. If they go the way of Rage they are doomed to break up in the near future. Rage is dead, that is System of a Down territory (of which I am a fan). <br />This was a 6 star album mixed with a 1 star album. At the end of the day, the great songs pull it out of oblivion and make it a good choice. Just don't expect a solid listen from start to finish.
0385504209|5.0|Wow 1 for indepth development of the characters; Wow 2 for a marvelous plot contrived of fiction and truth and a whole lot of research; Wow 3 for page turning events that consumed me from the moment I bought the book; Wow 4 for suspending any sense of reality I previously felt and replacing it with wanting to find the tomb; and Wow 5 for wanting to tell everyone I know who likes a good read about it and get them to read it so we could join in the quest. I have ordered the rest of his books and can't wait to read them. Couldn't have been better.
B000088E6D|5.0|really good cd. very nice song delivery and style. it hasn't left my cd player since I bought it 2 weeks ago.....
B000089RVX|5.0|I have one word to describe this album, AMAZING.  Evanescence's sound is unlike any other arist in the rock industry right now. No other female rock artist has so successful completed an album with such a variety of sound...its got everything any heavy rock fan is looking for and more...I highly recommand this CD to anyone
B000069HJL|5.0|I'm a fan of Progressive Rock (Art Rock).<BR>If you like Camel, Kayack, Latte e Miele, PFM, Banco, etc,<BR>Listen to this Live album.<br />I like Paris live musics most among other supertramp's works.
B000069CWE|4.0|I heard most of my friends tell me to not get this album and all kinds of reviews showed reanimation as &quot;just another remix album&quot; Once again they were very wrong....If you like rap/hip-hop and rock then I would defintely buy this CD or at least download it.  People downed this CD because I guarantee they didn't listen to the whole thing...don't listen to what other people say, this album rocks!!
B00008H2LB|5.0|I've personally been a fan of Linkin Park since their debut album \\"Hybrid Theory\\". I loved that album, and i was blown away by their remix album \\"Reanimation\\", so i had to pick up this one. There are lots of things l iike and dislike about \\"Meteora\\", so i provided a track-by-track review below:<br />\\"Don't Stay\\" - I personally love this track, a really good way to start off such an incredible album. Chester's screaming can get annoyning at times, however, the raps make up for it in the end.<BR>4/5 Stars<br />\\"Somewhere I Belong\\" - The incredible first single, we've all heard it and i love it. This song (according to the booklet) was originally a sample of Chester playing electric guitar, after over a year of work, it was completed. I say it was well worth a year of work. Also, if you pop the cd into your computer, there's an option to watch this video.<BR>5/5 Stars<br />\\"Lying From You\\" - This is a pretty good song, kind of mediocre compaired to everything else, but worth a spot on the album. Once again, Chester's screaming gets a little annoying.<BR>4/5 Stars<br />\\"Hit The Floor\\" - This is a brilliant song. Not only is the beginning addictive, but the raps from Mike are excellent, Chester's screaming is actually tolerable on this one.<BR>5/5 Stars<br />\\"Easier To Run\\" - A good song, fits in good with the album, but for some reason i wasn't blown away by it. Chester somewhat sings here, which makes it better than screaming.<BR>3/5 Stars<br />\\"Faint\\" - A pretty good song, the second single from the album. I personally think \\"Hit The Floor\\" would've made a better second single. The videos cool though.<BR>4/5 Stars<br />\\"Figure.09\\" - Another mediocre song, but this one has good raps and Chester's screaming, so it's kind of better than some of the others.<BR>4/5 Stars<br />\\"Breaking The Habit\\" - There is absolutely no way to describe how incredible this song is. Chester's singing in front of a orchestra and some DJ work, excellent. This should definitely be a single, incredible. The booklet says this song took a whopping six years to complete, everything's worth it.<BR>5/5 Stars<br />\\"From The Inside\\" - Another good singing job from Chester until near the end where he starts screaming. Good raps and an OK sound. All together mediocre again.<BR>4/5 Stars<br />\\"Nobody's Listening\\" - I just love this song. Mike's rhymes are stellar and the Chinese flute at the beginning is incredible. A really good track.<BR>5/5 Stars<br />\\"Session\\" - This is another song like the one off of Hybrid Theory that has no words, however, the music is incredible.<BR>4/5 Stars<br />\\"Numb\\" - A really good ending to the album, a good job from Chester on this one. All together, i love the album, its excellent.<BR>5/5 Stars<br />Also, like i mentioned on \\"Somewhere I Belong\\", if you pop this cd into your computer you not only get the video of track 3, but you also get a segment titled \\"The Art Of Meteora\\", in which the band tells about what Meteora is and shows artwork from the album. Also, there are options for LPTV (An online viewing of Linkin Park Television), a Merch section, a Website Tool-Kit, an Extras section, and the story of Linkin Park's fan club LPU (Linkin Park Underground).<br />In addition, is there a reason LP's last 2 albums have been packaged in DIGI-Pak's. Maybe because of the thick booklets? I don't know, but i prefer a regular case, only due to the fact that the booklet from mine falls out. <br />Overall, incredible album.
B00008H2LB|4.0|I thought reanimation would of been better if linkin park spent more time on it but Meteora makes up for it.  If you are a die-hard linkin park fan like me you will defintely like this album, its got hybrid theory and a little bit of reanimation mixed it.  I gave it 4 stars because most of the songs sound pretty much the same and sound a lot like hybrid theory but overall I recommend this album to all linkin park fans.  For the fans who havent heard linkin park's hybrid theory I would recommend buying that first before Meteora.
6304416415|5.0|At theatres In the summer of '89, \\"Honey I Shrunk the kids\\" more than held it's own against box office heavyweights such as \\"Do the Right thing\\", \\"Batman\\", and \\"Indiana Jones and the last crusade\\". Quite the feat, considering it's relatively obscure cast (well, compared to the afforementioned films.) <br />The movie starts out with a nice animation sequence that looks as good now as it did 13 years ago. The live action starts as a typical Saturday morning in suburbia at the Szalinski's house, except that Wayne (Rick Moranis) is a bumbling inventor who built a shrinking ray in his attic that he can't get to work, his son (Robert Oliveri) is a mirror-image. And the daughter (Amy O'Neill) is pretty much your typical Blond teenager [a good looking one at that ;)] <BR>who hopes she gets asked to the dance. The mother, Diane Szalinski, played by Marcia Strassman (of Welcome Back, Kotter fame) does a good job as well. Cork, the family dog also deserves mentioning. <br />Next door are the All-American Thompsons, who have big plans for a weekend fishing trip. Their oldest son Russ Jr. (Thomas Wilson Brown) is less than enthusiastic about those plans. He's a bit scrawny for his age and Big Russ has expectations to see him excel at High School football, which isn't Little Russ's Niche. Meanwhile younger son Ron Thompson (Jared Rushton) is the apple of Big Russ's eye, and can be quite mischievous at times, setting up a booby trap that his dad walks into. <br />The underrated Matt Frewer steals the show as Big Russ Thompson, Brash and Sarcastic (in a good way of course). And providing the perfect compliment is his wife, the calmer Mae Thompson (played by Kristine Sutherland). <br />The backstory is this:Ron Thompson hits a baseball into the Szalinskis attic, in turn setting off the shrinking machine (which hadn't worked until that point) and in their effort to retrieve the ball, Ron and Nick get zapped and are 1/4 inch tall, Amy and Russ Jr., who walk up to the attic wondering what happened to them, meet a similar fate. Wayne returns home from a dismal day at work, having been made a laughing stock because of his lack of proof for the shrinking machine. He takes his frustration out on the machine itself, severely damaging it in the process, he sweeps the broken parts (and the four kids) off the floor and into the trash bag. He then takes it out across the yard, and the kids are, as Nick eloquently says \\"We're now a quarter of an inch tall, and sixty four feet from the house. That's an equivalent of three-point-two miles. That's a long way. Even for a man of science.\\" Even more of a trek considering the extra thick grass they must walk through. <br />En route the gang faces Swarms of bees and scorpions [among other obstacles that I won't give away;)]. There's decent use of special effects and, even if they may look a bit fake, it's still entertaining nonetheless. I'll end my description here, as anything more would spoil the film. <br />If this review doesn't entice you to check out \\"Honey, I shrunk the kids\\", I don't know what will. It's a classic in my opinion.<br />As an added bonus, the hilarious Roger Rabbit short \\"Tummy Trouble\\" is included.
B0000029AL|5.0|Originally overlooked in 1973 when it came out Aerosmith's debut is an awesome record.Their debut basically became popular in 1976 on the momentum of their career \\"Toys in the Attic\\" and \\"Rocks\\" being in the charts around that time.1976 \\"Dream On\\" got rereleased as a single and went into the top 40 shortly after \\"Walk this Way\\" and \\"Sweet Emotion\\".Listening to this album it's hard too see why \\"Dream On\\" and the album itself didn't become huge hits when they were first released.Of the 8 songs on the album,all 8 are pretty good.\\"Make it\\" is a song about trying to make as musicians.\\"Mama Kin\\",\\"Walking the Dog\\",\\"Somebody\\",\\"One Way Street\\",\\"Movin' Out\\",and \\"Dream On\\" were all very good songs and in my opinion \\"Aerosmith\\" was a very strong debut album and shot have became a hit instantly.If you love the music Aerosmith put out in the 70's you must have this album.
B00008PW3Q|5.0|While Rumours is in my mind one of the most incredible albums of all time, it is wonderful to see how these artists have grown throughout almost 30 years.  This CD is great, I think it is some of the best music that has been released in the industry within the last 12-24 months.  And it is certainly THE superior release from any of the older bands that have survived the years. It certainly doesn't seem to be geared for FM radio, but then again either was Rumours. Some of the CD track highlights are Steal Your Heart Away, Running Through the Garden, Say You Will, Smile at You (which is an incredible song, should be the next single, just my opinion) and Illume (9-11). I thought I would miss Christine McVie, however, I didn't.  I was too busy rockin...This CD is definitely worth the money! (After listening a couple of times, I ended up buying the Limited Edition too!
B000005RQT|4.0|I already wrote a review for the standard cd version, but since it doesn't appear on my reviews list, this intenionally different one will. This is the version of this hard rock classic to own. Awesome, Spinal Tap-like volume in the red, remastered sound. The extras are nice, particularly the smokin' Black Night single on which Blackmore punishes the tremolo bar, and an interesting alternate version of Speed King. I now know of 3 official alternate versions, the other two on the must own 'Listen Learn Read On' box set. This was the first hard rock album that featured two lead soloists(both virtuosos), and there's only one guitarist for a change. How many rock bands have a keyboardist who, like the guitarist, is just as strong technically and volume-wise? Very few indeed, and remember, Purple's playing only got better from here, and was actually already better live. Perhaps Led Zeppelin were at home in the studio more often since they actually got along, but Purple Mk II did manage some incredible studio performances(and they were always better live, the best hard rockers out there)before singer Gillan had enough of Blackmore and made like a speed king out of there. Definitely lamentable considering Gillan's phenomenal vocal range(\\"Child In Time\\" on here says it all)pitted against Blackmore's in-your-face guitar heroics. Of course live, with Lord's classical and jazz leanings as well, this old album had simply more to offer all around than the competion(the closest thing in '70 was Zeppelin, but they were hard-blues rock). Anyway, this is early, raw Mk II trying on their first studio offering for size. That's the charm here, hearing hard rock's finest ever live band using volume and technical agression as a weapon, before more polished later studio albums. Machine Head is Mk II Purple's best(not counting live)I think, but this is where it all began, baby. To paraphrase a tune here, \\"Heeeaaarrr them flyyyy\\"!
0385508417|5.0|A quick read, well written, and enormously funny. If you're a middle age suburbia rat racer, this little book will make you laugh out loud. I gave several copies of this book for Christmas presents especially to those who aren't avid readers. A delightful book for young and old.
B00005JLET|5.0|This movie is a funny yet action pack (sort of). I've seen kiki's delivery service and it didn't catch me. But this movie was ausome.My favorite character was Haku. It's a great movie for the family. I personaly think there should be a sequel. People that look at this review should trust me because I love anime. This movie is now my favorite movie. Now my top 5 list of favorite animes are:<BR>-Spirited Away<BR>-Princess Moninoke<BR>-DBZ<BR>-Dirty Pair Flash<BR>-YuYu Hakusho
B00008NRL8|5.0|The best album I heard in 2001, great to dance (although difficult) and great to listen to. The fact that a huge number of commercials used samples from this album says it all. Catchy mellodies and a lounge atmosphere suitable for all time of the day. Not only for tango lovers, in fact it will appeal even to those that &quot;detest&quot; tango!! A must have!
B00006JLX4|5.0|As the initial foundation of the alt. rock boom that took place in the early 90s, Indie Rock has always been a lower profile counterpart to the genre that spawned success story acts like The Smashing Pumpkins or Nirvana.  Mixing catchy melodies with abrasive feedback in the same fashion as their alt. rock peers, but always willing to remain in the realm of \\"cult classics,\\" no band sums up the concept of indie rock better than the original slacker quartet of Pavement.  A true musical embodiment of the disenchanted wasteoid generation of teenage slackers who fell through the cracks of alternative rock's more mainstream ideals, Pavement captures all the anguish, frustration, boredom, and angst of any and all American teenagers and as the band's first studio album, Slanted &amp; Enchanted immediately struck a chord with the youth of America.  The blissful waves of sonic distortion and the overriding sloppy, carefree spirit of the music fully expressed the intangible sense of immediacy that fills the lives of adolescents.  In essence, the lazy drawling vocals, the twin guitars that could join in a power chord alliance or clash in manic solos in an instant, and the vague yet strangely depressing lyrics all convey a state of emotional turmoil, sometimes even all out warfare, that is a perfect representation of the world's many dissatisfied teens.  Furthermore, this constant battle of emotions not only results in a pristine representation of the ravaged teenage mind, but also gives the album an immense sense of musical diversity.  From the bouncy punk of \\"Two States\\" to the melancholy, introspection of \\"Here,\\" Slanted matches its constantly shifting moods with an equally varied assortment of styles.  Slanted and Enchanted is then finally tied together with decidedly rough production that accurately captures the group's sporadic live dynamics, delivering their multifaceted message in as pure and untainted a form as possible.  Easily one of the greatest albums of the 90s, Slanted and Enchanted's wonderfully amateurish charm, hilarious wit, and willingness to experiment makes it a dense blend of punk, alt. and even Avant Garde, that successfully revamps the musical accomplishments of past visionaries for a brand new generation of listeners.<br />While the album itself is already a significant accomplishment in the world of modern rock and is most certainly a rewarding listen, the ludicrous amount of bonus material included on the Slanted and Enchanted Luxe and Redux reissue greatly enhances the CD.  Including 2 John Peel Sessions, 2 Eps, 1 album session, and 1 entire live show, this set is enough to make any Pavement fan salivate, and with good reason.  The quality of these included B-sides, rarities, and otherwise hard to find tracks is consistently breathtaking, easily ranking with the best tracks off of Slanted, which only further shows the mind-blowing creative potency of Pavement at the beginning of their career.  If you already own Slanted and Enchanted, buy the reissue, and if you don't, then still buy the reissue because when literally 140 minutes of music and 48 tracks are put on one album, and the album never becomes dull for even a minute, you know that there is definitely some real talent behind the band.
B00005JLEU|5.0|Well, the firs time i saw the preview of this movie i had absoutly no interest in seeing it. But when it won the oscar and the previews started to grow, then i wanted it. On easter my parents got me it, i watched it and was blown away. The animation was diffrent, the story was diffrent. Its good to see an anime film thats diffrent from your average films. Go out and buy it, its wortht he money.
B00005JLEU|4.0|The animation and drawn movement of the characters in this movie is abolutely terrific.  But even though it can touch on deep things at time, it never brings all these deep messages together, or shows how they relate to any overall theme or plot in the movie.  I didn't give the movie 5 stars because it left too many things unexplained, unsaid, and unresolved.  Basicly this movie leaves you hanging with too many loose ends, it almost needs a sequel to tie it up.  <BR>  Another problem is that too many lucky coincidence happen, (like Chihiro just happening to be standing on the balcony when Haku is being chased).  Even just an implication like they were somehow psychically bonded would have done, but there was nothing.  Or how everything at the end just seems too resolve itself, and how nearly all the bad guys are suddenly good guys (like No-face) for no apparent reason.  It also suffers from some pacing problems, where it just seems to rely on the animation to keep you interested.  <BR>  Now some of this could just be a result of the english translation, but not all of it.  Other than those weakness and complaints, the movie is really great overall.  It is definitely worth watching, just don't expect a truly coherent plot or theme.
B000002L99|5.0|This is obviously the first VH album featuring Sammy Hagar as lead singer. It was noticably different from all previous albums. Most attribute this jarring shift in the bands sound to Sammy, but it really wwasn't his doing. Listen again--it's actually Eddie that changed so drastically. There are only 9 songs; 3 are synth-driven. Of the remaining 6, only 2 are heavy guitar songs, and even those aren't the heavy-handed style we've come to adore Ed for so much.<br />Ed obviously made a decision to depart from his signature sound for the sake of branching out, I suppose. But it's poor Sammy that gets blamed for it.<br />Overall, 5150 is a fantastic album, and contrary to what another reviewer wrote, it has aged beautifully. \\"Love Walks In,\\" \\"Dreams,\\" \\"5150,\\" \\"Summer Nights,\\" \\"Best of Both...\\" And the list goes on. In and of itself, it's a wonderful album, a classic. But when held up to the Dave-era standard, it will never satisfy the die-hard old VH fan.
0553573403|4.0|I gave this book 3 stars because, though it was a good read, it appeals mostly to certain type of taste and reader.  People keep complaining that it isn't a true fantasty, but what really defines what a fantasy is?  The writing is excellent, but comparing this book to Tolkien is futile.  For one thing, Tolkien's books were scene extravaganza's this however is more of a character extravaganza.  The sets in this are just set's for the characters say their dialogue in.  (Though some are beautifully written)<br />  Now I have to agree that it is definately a type of soap opera, but that doesn't mean it resembles any of those hokey daytime shows.  It just means that it is mainly about well drawn characters interactions with each other, and their scheming with and against each other.<br />  But the biggest weakness of this book is its lack of making the overall theme clearly implied, or understood.  I'm sorry, but to have an epic series you need to at least let the reader know for sure that there is an epic plot and theme that carries throughout the series.  You don't have to state it is, but just leaving the reader unsure and unclear if its there, is a big weakness for an epic series.<br />  And though each characters little story or theme seems to come full round by the end of this, you're left asking how does this all fit together, or does this all fit together?  I took off most for that, because I think overall story is the most important thing for an epic fantasy.  But all in all, a fascinating read.
B000063DFS|4.0|I own the original of this CD so I am basing my review on the original without the bonus tracks.  I like the CD a lot and it has some of Ozzy's best songs.  Don't expect to hear any ultra heavy stuff on here though because this album was kind of a break from that, it's for the most part Ozzy's lighter side.  However, he does a great job putting together a light album with the help of some great musicians, especially well-known guitarest Zakk Wylde.  Zakk continues to play guitar for Ozzy and also for his other project, Black Label Society.  No More Tears has some beautiful songs that almost anyone can enjoy such as, \\"Mama, I'm Coming Home\\", \\"Road To Nowhere\\" and \\"Time After Time\\".  However, it still has a few songs with that heavy edge like, \\"Desire\\".  My personal favorite on the CD would be \\"No More Tears\\" though, a great all-around song and a timeless masterpiece.  Whether a heavy metal fan or even a general rock fan, I think it's a great addition to anyone's collection.
B00000G3Q4|5.0|Having been raised on horror films, \\"The Evil Dead\\" is a must-see for all hor-gore fans.  It makes \\"The Exorcist\\" look like a G-rated film.  It is non-stop, out-of-your-skin, out-of-the-dark, out-of-the-woods terror.  While it is 20 years old, it holds its own.  Many have failed in trying to capture the essence of true horror...this film does it with no finesse, no class, no-holds-barred.  This is one serious horror flick.  If you have a good stomach, love to feel your flesh crawl, haven't had a good scare lately, buy \\"The Evil Dead\\".  But whatever you do, don't go into the woods.  DON'T GO INTO THE WOODS!  The entire film is shot inside and outside a rickety cabin in, yes (how'd you guess it?) the woods.  The DVD even has a printed color insert called \\"The Girls of The Evil Dead\\".  Does that tell you something?  These three ladies will, at the outset, win your heart.  By films end, they will tear your heart out - LITERALLY!!
B000062XGB|4.0|Whatever creative links truly exist we think of the 1999 film \\"Anna the King\\" as a dramatic version of \\"The King and I,\\" which was a musical version of the 1946 film \\"Anna and the King of Siam,\\" which was inspired by the diaries of Anna Leonowens.  Now, it turns out that Anna Leonowens, who was hired to tutor the children of the king of Siam in 1862, greatly embellished her adventures in her celebrated book.  She was neither a governess nor an advisor to the king, her late husband was a desk clerk and not a military officer, and she made up the lurid stories about the king throwing wives into dugeons and the public torture and burning of a consort and the monk she loved.  Of course, history rarely matters to Hollywood and in this case the idea of a romance between Anna and the King overwhelms everything else.<br />The real King Mongkut of Siam was about 60 years old when Anna arrived to teach English to the king's children (you can easily find photographs of him on the web), which would be the final blow to thoughts of romance if all those wives, concubines, public executions, and pagan believes did not turn off any widowed Englishwoman employed in his palace.  But despite its flaws \\"The King and I\\" is a pretty good romance; the scene where Yul Brynner dances with Deborah Kerr is one the sexiest scenes in Hollywood history (watch how they look at each other after the dance finishes) and there is no profit to be made in trying to convince a modern audience that this story is not a romance.  We might have a more accurate view of George Custer at the Little Bighorn, but we cling to our romanticized vision of \\"Anna and the King.\\"<br />This is a gorgeous film.  The story may well distort the cultural history of what is now Thailand, but the film can certainly inspire you to want to visit.  Yun-Fat Chow plays the King as a figure refined enough to tempt Anna, who is played by Jodie Foster.  Ironically enough, in this version of the tale, which seeks to present King Mongkut as more cultured and civilized than ever, Anna's prejudicial views stand out more than ever.  Every time she stands up to the king, ask yourself if she would really do the same thing to Queen Victoria.  She might be a woman but she is an Englishwoman, not to mention a Christian, and that pretty much settles everything.<br />Ultimately, two things distinguish this version of the story.  The first is that Anna undergoes much more of a transformation that the King this time around.  The person who benefits most from her presence is Prince Chulalongkorn (Keith Chin), heir to the thrown, and most of that education is implied rather than shown.  In fact, there are several scenes that make it clear the King is smarter than Anna; his problem is more than of pride than anything else.  In the major subplot involving Tuptim (Ling Bai), Anna only makes things worse from start to finish.  The second is that the political problems of Mongkut and his kingdom are considerably more serious.  Troops from Burma are crossing the border and killing Siamese.  This raises the possibility of war, but since Burma is under the protection of the British, the stakes are pretty high.  The end result is that more than ever before, Anna gets to be the salvation of the King and the nation of Siam (i.e., Thailand banned \\"The King and I\\" and they will ban this film too).<br />\\"Anna and the King\\" is a beautiful film, but does not touch the heart the way a true romance should.  In fact, the heart of the film is in the affection of the king for his youngest daughter, Princess Fa-Ying (Melissa Campbell), who truly touches him in a way no other person does.  Director Andy Tennant captured magic with \\"Ever After,\\" but this film ends up missing the mark.  It has Anna, the King, and even dancing, but this time around it is not enough.t as more cultured and civilized than ever, Anna's prejudicial views stand out more than ever.  Every time she stands up to the king, ask yourself if she would really do the same thing to Queen Victoria.  She might be a woman but she is an Englishwoman, not to mention a Christian, and that pretty much settles everything.<br />Ultimately, two things distinguish this version of the story.  The first is that Anna undergoes much more of a transformation that the King this time around.  The person who benefits most from her presence is Prince Chulalongkorn (Keith Chin), heir to the thrown, and most of that education is implied rather than shown.

B00005QZ7U|5.0|Fantastic story  ... Just watch it ... I watch it like 7 or 8 times/month
B00005JLKN|5.0|Instead of making another ridiculous self-parody<BR>like &quot;Hannibal&quot;, this film recreates the enviornment of fear, suspense, and intelligence present in &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot;. &quot;Red Dragon&quot; begins with a brilliantly twisted scene that shows us how Hannibal Lecter was caught and sent to a mental institution. This film probably does not have as much Hannibal as &quot;Silence&quot;, but the scenes with Hannibal are eerie, entertaining, and a little bit humorous. Hopkins does it again with his flawless acting and the other actors are superb also. Ralph Fienees creates one of the most terrifying psychopaths of cinema, Franchis Dolarhyde, THE RED DRAGON. Years after Hannibal Lecter is locked away, Dolarhyde kills two innocent families and violats the mothers (they don't actually show him doing so on screen). Will Graham, the retired-detective who caught Hannibal, has a special gift for getting inside the mind of the serial killer; figuring out what makes the killer tick. So, in order to save innocent families from being murdered in the future, Will returns to his detective work for one last case. Despite Will's fear of the Hannibal Lecter, he visits the cannoblistic psychiatrist in the mental institution for some insight. Dolarhyde, with a giant tattoo on his back of a dragon, is horrifically insane, but he is not just a monster. He has some feelings, and he's probably one of the most sympathetic villains, despite his horrible actions. Francis Dolarhyde was made insane through years of mental abuse from his crazy grandmother (seems a little bit like homage to &quot;Psycho&quot;). When Dolarhyde meets a blind woman whom he has feelings for, it is hard not to give into his murderous insanity. That is a key element in the film; will Dolarhyde go over the edge by killing his love? How does the blind woman make him more sensitive and human?  How will Hannibal have his vengeance on the man who locked him away? These are all interesting details in the film, and add to its appeal. So, in a nut shell, terrific acting, horrificly monsterous scenes, a wonderfully eerie score, and sad but interesting details about the mind of a madman, make this one of the best psychological thrillers I have seen! I recommend it to fans of &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot;.
B00005JLSE|4.0|This film is a good attempt to do what was done in Moulin Rouge...Moulin Rouge was just so good and the directing and acting were so masterful. I mean come on  you cannot compare what's her name to Nicole Kidman, the star was good, the film was good, there was no story, no moral, no life, it was just a hardworked artificial americanized attempt to make a musical. Good Luck Next time ....   Moulin Rouge will be the Legend, people will watch it 50 years from now, like we watch Casablanca...
B00003CX9E|5.0|If you are a film buff you need to watch this. One of the first movies to ever use deep focud lenses which clear the picture dramatically. This movie is praised as employing every filmic qualitie that is used today.
0553579908|5.0|Clearly, since I've given A CLASH OF KINGS a five-star rating, it's safe to conclude that I liked it. A lot, as a matter of fact. But that doesn't mean you will. Most of the other  reviewers here appear to have liked it, but not all of them by any means. Many have also described the book and/or the leading characters, so I won't try to improve on that. Instead,  I will simply pass along my thoughts, as follows:<br />You should not even consider reading A CLASH OF KINGS unless you have already read A GAME OF THRONES, its predecessor. If you've read A GAME OF THRONES and liked it, you will almost certainly like A CLASH OF KINGS. It's more of the same tale, with all of the strengths of the first book carried forward. By the same token, if you didn't like the first book (for whatever reasons), don't bother with this one.<br />Personally, after reading these two books, I feel that this series is one of the top fantasy series in print. I don't happen to feel that it's quite on a par with Tolkien, as some have asserted. Tolkien, a life-long English scholar, wrote with an elegance that few can match (not to take anything away from Martin, he's just not quite in that class). Tolkien's work also had a touch of sympathy and humor that isn't present here. These books are fascinating and well-written, but there is scarcely a hint of humor and little sympathy in them. Frodo has no loyal Samwise here. Nevertheless, the complexity, intricate plotting, depth of characterization, and ability and willingness of the author to surprise the reader are first-rate. Nobody is safe in these books and there's not always a clear division between &quot;good guys&quot; and &quot;bad guys&quot;. There's no opportunity for the committed reader to become complacent.<br />Simply put, I think this is great stuff, and a lot of other people agree. If you're wavering over whether or not to give this series a try, then DO it. Hesitate no longer. But don't start here, start with A GAME OF THRONES.
B00001P4RI|1.0|I got this CD right when it was released.  The cover indicated that maybe the spirit of Dead Can Dance had not completely died.  How wrong I was.  After listening to this, I realized that the real soul of Dead Can Dance was Lisa.  You can still hear it in her music.  Brendan seems to want to be a folk singer now.  I suppose being in arguably the greatest musical group of the late 20th century just burned him out.
B00008PW3Q|2.0|OVERVIEW: With Christine McVie contentedly retired on her English estate, Lindsey Buckingham has all the more elbow room for his pretentious, off-the-wall ramblings...and considering this is the first new Mac album in nearly a decade, that's not a good thing.  Granted, he can still write a good pop song when he lets himself, and Stevie Nicks is in classic form.  But no McVie and more Buckingham is just a little too much to take.<br />AT ITS BEST: &quot;What's the World Coming To&quot; and &quot;Bleed to Love Her&quot; prove Buckingham hasn't completely lost his touch...even the quirky production touches behind &quot;Miranda&quot; are measured enough to winningly succeed.  And Stevie Nicks sounds completely on top of her game, particularly on instantly familiar gems like &quot;Silver Girl&quot; and &quot;Illume.&quot;  Nicks also has the foresight to recognize a kindred spirit when she sees one, and this album marks yet another occasion when she recruits Sheryl Crow for backup vocals and production input.<br />AT ITS WORST: With nonsensical messes like &quot;Morrow Turning in His Grave&quot; and &quot;Red Rover,&quot; it's clear that FM doesn't have enough strong, compelling material without McVie to warrant a whole album, much less one with eighteen tracks.  Even Nicks can serve up a tepid brew, proven on &quot;Everybody Finds Out&quot; and &quot;Running Through the Garden.&quot;<br />OVERALL: Sad but true...it's far more comforting to pull out your well-worn copy of &quot;Rumours,&quot; drown yourself in a chorus of &quot;The Chain,&quot; and hope that Christine McVie has a nice garden this summer.
B00003CXB2|4.0|\\"Lawrence of Arabia\\" is, of course, one of the finest motion pictures ever made -- no secret there!! The current DVD release offers the highest quality picture on home video to date. Nevertheless, it still doesn't come within a mile of revealing the glorious clarity of this film when it's projected in 70-millimeter onto a huge screen. The audio on this disc -- notably the music -- sounds extremely compressed and nasal to my poor ears. Just as a comparison, check out the music on the Director's Restoration laserdisc. There's a big, BIG difference !! Which leads me to the following:<br />I would gladly support Columbia/TriStar bringing out a Superbit edition of \\"Lawrence\\", if only to have Superbit's added visual crispness and its uncompressed audio. And I wouldn't care one bit if Act One had to be split over two disc sides -- its running time alone is longer than most ordinary films anyway. \\"Lawrence\\" deserves the best possible treatment no matter what the format. The price of Superbit DVDs isn't significantly higher. Is there anyone at Columbia/TriStar who's listening?
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril Lavigne is originally from a small town in Ontario, Canada called Napanee . Being a fellow Canadian, i must say i'm extremely impressed by this very talented singer! Here is my review:<br />1-Losing Grip: this is currently her new single! and one of the best songs of the cd. Her voice, and the lyrics make the song as great as it is! I love the climax that the song builds up too, its an awesome song! 10/10<br />2- Complicated: The first single and song that got Avril her \\"big\\" break! This song has a very catchy hook! which probably made it such a huge hit. 10/10<br />3- Sk8er Boi- This song is just fun i guess you could say! Avril sounds awesome singing it, and its just a great song to listen to! 9/10<br />4- I'm With You- I have to say this is one of my favorite songs of this cd! The lyrics are awesome! but its her voice that makes this song shine! Definately one of the best tracks! 10/10<br />5- Mobile: This song is oh k, it's not one of my favorite but its still good 7/10<br />6- Unwanted: I love the attitude in this song! Avril knows how to use her voice as a great tool! Great song! 9/10<br />7- Tommorrow: this is probably the one of the slowest songs off the cd! but its really good. Has a good melody and Avril sounds good! 8/10<br />8- Anything But Ordinary: This song is also really good, shows that some people like to not be the typical stereotype 8/10<br />9- Things I'll Never Say: I have to say a lot of people can probably relate to this song! It's pretty good 8/10<br />10- My World: This song pretty much describes Avril.. catchy and good 7/10<br />11- Nobody's Fool: I really like this song, not too much else to say about it! 9/10<br />12- Too Much To Ask: This song is really good! Avril again can use her voice to sing \\"slower\\" songs 9/10<br />13- Naked: I LOVE this song, besides I'm With You it's one of my favorite tracks off the cd! Avril really shows she has a really great voice! 10/10<br />Overall Avril has proven she is a great talent! and i mightsound biast because i'm from Canada too.. but i'm not! I think Avril Lavigne is very talented, and she deserves all the success that she has had! I'm seeing her in concert in like 4 days and am really looking forward to it! If you don't buy this cd you really are missing out!
B00000DGUY|2.0|I am a Dire Straits fan.  This is why I am disappointed that this compilation provides cut versions of many tracks. Two minutes of Knopfler's beautiful closing riffs in Calling Elvis are gone while Private Investigations suffers a similar fate.  The live version of Local Hero is gracious but not representative of the rock version on the soundtrack.<BR>In short this is a disappointing compilation of Dire Straits' great work. In fact, it is strange that the record companies have not worked out that this sort of offering is exactly why people make their own compilations. This CD is &quot;Money for nothing&quot;.  Buy the original CDs and burn your own favorites!
B00005QIPH|3.0|If you like their sound in the first song--well, all the songs sound the same, so you're in luck: that's it, kids.  The singer's hipper-than-thou style can be just what the doc ordered, but it gets annoying; the lo-fi, (originally delightfully) uncomplicated post-grunge music isn't wearing well with time.  In other words, this is a Kraft Mac-n-Cheez kind of album: delightfully reminiscent of your once-trendy red tennies, endless Atari battles, summer nights spent in a small town in the parking lot at Wal-Mart, but ultimately it doesn't sit that well in your stomach, being cheap and empty.  Eventually, you grow up and move on to something with more substance.  Or go back to the old favorites it reminded you of in the first place.
B00006I9HJ|5.0|this album is everything music has been building up to.  at first i wasn't sure about it- it didn't sound like the nada surf i knew and loved.  but it is just a more grown up nada surf with beautiful riffs and dreamy songs that i can listen to non-stop it seems.  it is not pop- if you don't like music unless it makes the radio, you might not like this- but you are missing out on alot of good music and are shallow.  i really like this album alot
B000066NW0|1.0|Can you say annoying? Lets lay out all my problems so I can make everyone miserable. Yuck!! And what is with &quot;Sk8er Boi&quot;??? Who came up with that spelling? Big Bertha in Special Ed.?? Why can't anyone in the music career have actual talent??
B00006879E|5.0|^_^ I first heard these guys after a friend sent me a copy of their song &quot;Must Get Out&quot;... I wasn't entirely impressed but they sounded good &amp; i bought the CD as soon as I could-- definitely a purchase worth making. Their sound is unique with the lead singer's unmistakable voice; their lyrics are wonderful &amp; i highly recommend this group to all of those who aren't screaming teenyboppers and actually believe in good music.
B00008J2DQ|5.0|When I first heard this CD, I automatically recognized the new, vicious sting that this album single-handedly possesses over the first two releases. \\"Faceless\\" has an all together heavier and more vibrant sound to it with Sully Erna experimenting with higher vocal ranges with that raspy scream of his. Tony Rombola has a much better sound, and displays much more skill than the previous two releases with an opening \\"Tom Morello\\" kind of sensibility. The new drummer, technically better than the last with a whole heck of a lot more power behind that set.<br />  I almost expected something similar to the last two releases, but after having it in my CD player for a week I realized that this has more power and more explosive potential to be a huge success. I am having a hard time understanding how people could say that \\"Faceless\\" is similar to the others, but that is strictly their opinion. I have found that this album has more VARIETY in sound than the PAST TWO releases. Higher pitches on guitars, higher pitched vocal runs, and more two guitar work than before. That already opens this release up full throttle, folks.<br />  Stand out tracks? Well, \\"Straight Out of Line\\", \\"Changes\\", \\"Make Me Believe\\", \\"Re-Align\\", and \\"I F*#%ing Hate You\\" are the first ones to come to mind. Those last two tracks just give it that \\"This is Godsmack, no doubt.\\" \\"The Awakening\\" is just so much better than previous releases \\"Voodoo\\" and \\"Spiral\\". The track is uplifting and very unique with Tony Rombola sporting an acoustic for it. I was astounded by this release and every other UNSUSPECTING Godsmack fan should be too.
B000000W5N|5.0|It rocks hard, no mistake, and though the Stones retained thier title &quot;World's Greatest Rock and Roll Band&quot; with songs like Brown Sugar and Bitch, the murky, slow songs are the ones that reveal Sticky Fingers true heart.  Since the release of their last studio album, Let It Bleed, the Stones world had been turned upside down in a number of ways.  Founding member and former leader Brian Jones had left the band and within weeks was dead.  Virtuoso guitarist Mick Taylor had joined the band.  The triumph of their '69 tour as well as the tragedy of Altamont.  Marianne Faithful had left Mick.  Keith had a baby with Brian Jones former love Anita Pallenberg.  Heck, even the Beatles had broken up.  And in the midst of all this chaos, the Stones released yet another of rocks' indisputably greatest albums of all time.<br />The Stones found the purpose to carry-on thanks to four vital factors on Sticky Fingers.  Mick Taylor's presence brings a new sense of purpose to the music: before his arrival, the extended coda on Can't You Hear Me Knockin' was not a consideration.  His guitar parts on Sway, Wild Horses, and Moonlight Mile employ a sophistication and a technique that bring these songs to new heights.  Mick Jagger can also be heard contributing significant anount of guitar throughout the album.  And though on Let it Bleed, the Stones flirted with adding horn parts, here they finally fully integrate horns into songs like Can't You Hear Me Knockin', I Got the Blues, and Bitch.  The final factor was Keith's friedship with Gram Parsons: Parsons, a former member of the Byrds and credited as being the pioneer of country-rock, taught Keith about country music, and thanks to the influence, Keith was able to create songs like Wild Horses and Dead Flowers.<br />...  <br />Nearly every song contains a drug reference; some overt (Can't You Hear Me Knockin', I Got the Blues, Dead Flowers, Sister Morphine), some hidden (Brown Sugar is slang for a particular form of heroin, WildHorses verse &quot;No offstage exits or offstage lines&quot;...just what kind of &quot;offstage lines&quot; are we talking about?).  And the lyrics to songs like the incredible Sway, Wild Horses, Sister Morphine, and the gorgeous Moonlight Mile depict the struggle to retain one's sense of identity and self in the face of insurmountable struggles.<br />Moonlight Mile - a track that Keith isn't present on - sums it all up: the rock life is one of great glory and creative fulfillment, but ultimately the one thing that can really give one's life a sense of purpose is being true to yourself and finding someone to help make it all worthwhile.  &quot;Made a rag pile of my shiny clothes/Gonna warm my bones&quot;, Mick sings, turning his back on the decadence of his life and declaring with intent &quot;I'm coming home&quot;.  The song concludes in a lovely but chilly atmosphere.  Does the protagonist make it?  Can he accomplish his dream of putting his past life behind him?  That's left ambiguous.  All that is certain is that as the enitre album makes clear, it can be a hard, cruel, uncaring world: all you can do is keep going, hoping the distance you put between you and your failures is and can be kept greater than the distance between you and your accomplishments.
0385507755|5.0|There is no better way to tell this story--Frey comes completely clean with us. The tone is set convincingly in the books first pages as Frey delivers his visceral opening chorus. And candor is the glue that holds the reader through Frey's brutal reincarnation. To be sure, there is much more to this book than honesty. Many of the people Frey introduces us to evoke a condition that surfaces only when the day-to-day of life comes to a boil. And our window into the evolution of Frey's spirituality is wide open. But it is Frey's honesty that is so very new here, so very important. I would recommend this book to anyone who has wanted to change their lives for the better.
B00006HAZG|4.0|I watched this with my daughter who prefers stories with easier language but she was crazy about this production and asked to get a copy of her own DVD.  Very understandable because of the excellent acting but also very faithful to the story.  Beautiful settings, and great costumes, this is the Masterpiece THeater production and keeps up the tradition well.<br />I would recommend, especially for families with kids being introduced to DIckens.
6302212529|5.0|When I was young I used to watch this movie after school every other day. Needless to say, it was my favorite, and I used to collect merchandise from this movie.<BR> Now, thirteen years later, I watched it again. It still is the most charming video I have ever owned. I never thought I'd say this again, but it's my most favorite movie ever!
B000002UB3|5.0|What can I say that has yet to be said. This album stood the test of time and stood tall. Sometimes when current music is lacking you have to look to the past. Abbey road is a dependable classic. A must to own. Listen and hear the influece this has had on latter bands.
B000066HHK|5.0|are u guys sure this is even the Hybrid Theory EP? I dont give a damn cuz I already got the EP when i joined the LPU but one of u guys may end up buying the cd and it may just be the limited edition hybrid theory with my december and high voltage as bonus tracks.
B000002UAX|5.0|What a strange album. It goes from here to there than back again.<BR>Still though a great album. Many of the great songs are found on other albums like the BLUE ALBUM. If you buy a best of you miss out on the real gems you don't here on the radio. Like HONEY PIE!
B00008PW3Q|4.0|Well, I have to say that there were several tracks on this CD that did not strike my fancy and there were several that were solid and classic Mac.  Overall I'm pleased with my buy. <br />Now, that said, let me give a well deserved RAVE.  'Running Through the Garden' is easily worth the price of the CD!  IMHO, it is at least as good as ANYTHING they have ever done before and may well be the greatest yet!  I can't listen to it enough!
B00000373U|5.0|Not one song on this album is not worthy. I will not list them because all are great. You will find some songs used also on the GOOG WILL HUNTING soundtrack. If you didn't know he produced that as well. We are talking about a master in his prime still. You must own this album, you must listen to the rest of his albums. You will only be doing yourself a favor. Like I said &quot;every song is great&quot;. I'm at a loss for words for praising this album. That does not happen with me often. 3 out of 5 for sonics.
B00005R62N|5.0|This is an essential classic.  As of this release, the line between hard rock and metal was made forever distinct; and the style contained within is the prototype for everything metal which was to follow.      The twin-guitar attack, the essential metal chug, the occasional flirtation with the double-kick (soon to be taken to ridiculous new levels of overexposure), the stratospheric vocal touches (nobody did the falsetto better than Rob Halford primarily because he knew well enough to use it tastefully and in moderation):  all these things signal the beginning of everything that followed (and a direct link to thrash and speed metal which would come to dominate 80's hard music), and all of them found their widest audience and finest display on \\"Undleashed in the East\\".    The long-burning question as to whether or not this is a genuine \\"live\\" album is irrelevant:  the end justifies the means.  To anyone who disagrees, I offer the following hypothetical scenerio:  By 1979, Judas Priest was a markedly different-sounding band than the Peter-Green-era-Fleetwood-Mac-style band which debuted in 1974 with the \\"Rocka-Rolla\\" LP.  Priest had however retained several of the excellent songs from their second LP \\"Sad Wings of Destiny\\" in their live set.  Also in their set were tracks from the abyssmally-produced \\"Sin After Sin\\".  As the band's new style gained them a following, they perhaps addressed the issue of finding the means to get their older material circulated before the public (and their new fans).  The solution was to re-record these older tracks in the newer style with modern production resources.  A studio recording would be the optimum way of presenting them, but the \\"live\\" format would be the best excuse to rework these songs.  I believe that the band may have opted to record these tracks in the studio, added crowd noise, had their cake, and ate it too.  The perfection and intensity of the resulting work is nearly beyond artistic criticism, despite the elaborate \\"live\\" album charade:  the band plays brilliantly, and Rob Halford's vocals set a stylistic precedent (displaying at times agression, intensity, charisma, and a unique-and-appropriate dark vulnerability which sets his brilliant performance apart from all but only the very best vocalists--as far as metal goes, the theatrical qualities of his voice place him in a class by himself).  Having seen Judas Priest in 1980, 1981, 1982, and 1983, I can confidently state that \\"Unleashed in the East\\" established monster tracks such as \\"Sinner\\", \\"The Ripper\\", \\"Tyrant\\", and the show-stopper setpiece \\"Victim of Changes\\" as Priest signature material and genre standards.      This most current edition adds welcome bonus tracks (though not as many as it should:  missing is \\"Beyond the Realms of Death\\" which I have on a European 12\\" from way back); but in any form, this is an essential masterwork.  Priest wrote the book.
B00004S6GL|5.0|What happens when a musician has more money and control. More instruments and better recording. Figure 8 is incredible for it's songwriting and over all musicianship. Elliott Smith is just a great great musician all around. On this album you will find introverted songs like EVERTHING REMINDS ME OF HER, EVERYTHING MEANS NOTHING TO ME, HAPPINESS, LA. Also adventerous stories like SON OF SAM. Every song on this album is worthy of the best singer-songwriters works. If you like the Beatles or their following solo projects you'll want this. What a underrated man this guy is. HAPPINESS is one of my favorite of all time on a long critical list. You will find nothing less then genius arrangments. Piano, guitar, rhythm and timing are all masterful. Even the CD itself comes in a cardboard case with lyrics and such in a pouch inside. Sonics are 4.5 stars out of 5.
B00008PW3Q|5.0|I own only two Fleetwood Mac CDs, this and Rumours. I have heard the whole album of Tango In The Night and highlights from their self-titled album, The Dance, and Tust.<BR>As a comparison, this is better than Tango In The Night, but not as good as Rumours.<BR>I think Lidsey is one of the best and most underated guitar players ever. Mick Fleetwood IS THE BEST drummer ever and John McVie is a great bass player.<BR>A lot of people don't like this because Christine McVie retired from music. Sorry to break it to you, but she was not one of the original members. She was a very talented singer and songwriter, but every person that is currently in the band could quit, except Mick Fleetwood, and there would still be Fleetwood Mac.<BR>What's The World Coming To- showcases Lindsey's vocals and has a sort of country twist to it.       <BR>Murrow Turning Over In His Grave- a great song and I agree with their opinion in it. I appreciate artist like the Dixie Chicks and John Mellencamp who will use their freedom of speech        <BR>Illume (9/11)- Stevie sounds better than ever on this tribute to the 9-11 victims.       <BR>Thrown Down- very good song        <BR>Miranda- the guitar on this is kind of like Never Going Back Again off Rumours.        <BR>Red Rover- I like this sounds like it could come off of a U2 album.        <BR>Say You Will- Best song on album        <BR>Peacekeeper- the first single off the album and is a awesome song        <BR>Come- I enjoy the verses and the guitar solo, but this song could have done withou the rap-metal chorus        <BR>Smile At You- fun song        <BR>Running Through The Garden- this is the way pop should be        <BR>Silver Girl- reminds me of Gold Dust Woman off of Rumours. Great story song.        <BR>Steal Your Heart Away- Lindsey crafts a perfect love song        <BR>Bleed To Love Her- originally appeared on The Dance. Pretty good.        <BR>Everybody Finds Out- great mainstream rocker.        <BR>Destiny Rules- I love this song<BR>Say Goodbye- 2nd best on album        <BR>Goodbye Baby- Great way to end an album.<BR>Buy this if you are a Fleetwood Mac fan or a classic rock fan.
B000002UY5|5.0|This is the first album from Blind Melon and it shows how green they were at the time. With singing sometimes drawn out a little to long and jamming not far behind. These can be debated as imperfections or seen as an incredible first for a group so young to the industry at the time. Most of the songs are happy hemp friendly jingles like the hit single NO RAIN. Some are serious lyric driven songs with tones that will survive the test of time such as CHANGE. This album illustrates young musicians exploring the common world of first freedom from home and the questions that arise from it. Since I've so far told you how green and these guys were; let me move on. More songs worth noting SOAK THE SIN, TONES OF HOME , TIME, PAPER SCRATCHER, I WONDER. All great. The sonics are a 3 out of 5; being critical.<BR>If I had to describe there music it would be Groovy rock. It's groove makes you want to dance with your eyes closed and lay in the grass.
B00008NRL8|5.0|This delicious debut courtesy of the french band (perhaps known for their leftfield jazz-dance hit &quot;triptico&quot;) combines accordion-based flourishes with shades of cool urban parisian jazz and deep bass driven downbeat rhythms that seem inspired by latin american tango sounds.<br />The resulting album is an intoxicating, inspired and thoroughly unique masterpiece, mixing contemporary european dance-culture with a romantic gypsy-like whimsical nostalgia. Some numbers like &quot;Una Musica Brutal&quot; are incredibly upbeat yet truly rustic. Very original compilation, and without hesitation 5-star material!
B00005QCVY|5.0|Easily one of my favorite films.  Everything about this film hits just the right chord.  It never fails to make me cry.  I understand why it has become a holiday favorite, but it's worth watching anytime you need a reason to have faith in humanity.
B00008H2LB|5.0|When I kept hearing all the hype about this album and how it would be &quot;harder than the first,&quot; I thought, great!  But now that it's out, it's obvious that it's pretty much the same formula of rap scratch and rock.  But is that really a bad thing?<br />Meteora's 12 songs (not including the intro) comprise a great cd, much better, I think, than the first.  While it's much of the same thing, the formula seems tigher; the melodies are catchier, there's a better balance with Mike's rapping, and there's plenty of stuff to show off Joe Hahn's skills on the turntable, most notably track 11.<br />All in all, if you liked Hybrid Theory, or even if you thought it was a so-so cd, you must try Meteora.  I really can't say there's a track I don't like, which is rare.  Personal favs are tracks 6, 13 and 11, but really they're all good.
B000068OSK|5.0|This is the first CD of the White Stripes and they could not make a better day-view album. Solid all around!
B00008PW3Q|5.0|I'm actually glad Christine McVie chose to retire (FYI, she won't be back because she won't tour.  So it's more than reasonable for the Mac not to let her record with them so the accompanying tour doesn't sound weird.), because as good as she was in the band, she had really started to lose it as a songwriter toward the end.  Look at the last 3 Fleetwood Mac albums to see what I mean.  Almost every song was co-written and they were either saying the same thing or didn't feel like her anymore.<br />As for this album, it reasserts the fact that Lindsey Buckingham is one of the great guitar gods/producers of his generation and new music from him has been sorely missed in the last decade.  It took a couple listens but &quot;Murrow&quot; is finally starting to resonate.  Stevie has returned to form here, with her best song in the title track since &quot;Stand Back.&quot;  The final two tracks are heartbreaking and a gorgeous pairing.  &quot;Everybody Finds Out&quot; reveals a more illicit side to her lovelife not ordinarily seen in her more fanciful romantic songs.  As long as she and Lindsey still put out music that is entertaining and showing different sides to themselves, they should keep recording.  Otherwise, they should gracefully retire like the soon to be 60 year old McVie.
B00008J4P5|5.0|If you're like me, then you must be beyond sick with all the pop in radio, TV, and in the Internet. The White Stripes is the band to listen to when you're just so sickened that you feel like smashing something (but don't want to). Their no-nonsense approach to music is superb, unlike most rock bands, Jack and Megan (White Stripes) have good musical chemistry, and their lyrics are funny, witty, and they just rock! I own all of the White Stripes CD's and they have not disapointed me in any of them. If you want to be rocked, amused, and liberated from the pop-mania in the media, get this album.
6304938241|5.0|I saw this movie in the theater and was entranced.  Seldom is there a film so beautiful to see with substance as well. <BR>Excellent on all levels. I highly recommend it to anyone who appreciates good literature as well as a good movie.
B000002NHN|5.0|I absolutely love Loreena McKennitt! Ever since I first heard her music, I fell deeply in love with it. *Turns up Cd player to full blast. \\"Marco Polo\\" can be heard* Heh. Very beautiful song. Almost all of Loreena's songs I can meditate to, but sometimes, just sometimes, I can't concentrate at all! I just have to get up and dance! <BR>My opinion is \\"I LOVE LOREENA MCKENNITT!!\\" <BR>Yup! <BR>Before I ever heard Loreena's version of The Highway Man, I have always loved the poem. Alfred Noyes is a wonderful artist in his own way. I cry almost every time I hear Loreena singing the tale of a young love that ends up with two deaths. (Proof that bess really did love her highway man ^.^) <BR>Anyway. I better end my rammble.<BR>*Sniffles* Aw. Poor Bess..... (I'm listening to The Highway Man right now.) <BR>Buh Bye for now!
0790743213|5.0|A grown-up thriller.  I think this is some of the best of Hitchcock's work.
B00005O5CM|4.0|... It has a university comedy film without drinking, gross sex scenes or anything else.  Playing Elle Woods, the ditzy heroine, Witherspoon carries the film through a series of impossible turns as she conquers Harvard law school. Drawing on the dumb blonde characters made famous by Marilyn Monroe and others, Witherspoon charms her way through a lovely piece of fluff. It has no social commentary of any kind. My lawyer wife groaned through the trial scenes as they became more ludicrous. The final cross examination is just hilarious.<br />I had a cold when I watched it and it met the intellectual depth I needed at that time.
1558908323|4.0|This gritty little sci-fi flick was a surprise hit at the box office and with critics thanks some solid performances, capable suspenseful direction from Guillermo Del Toro (Cronos, Blade 2), intelligent storytelling, and some great (at the time anyway, they are showing their age now more than ever) special effects.  Husband and wife scientists Mira Sorvino (cute as can be here) and Jeremy Northam create genetically altered cockroaches in an effort to end a roach carried disease which is killing children.  The cure works, but these engineered bugs begin to evolve as a very fast rate, mimicing their prey and becoming smarter by the minute.  The script, while it does have it's share of holes, is surprisingly intelligent, and while Del Toro's suspensefully done direction isn't bad at all (matter of fact it is quite commendable), Mimic doesn't play as scary as it seems it is supposed to.  All that aside, Mimic is a very good piece of sci-fi/horror that is more than worth checking out.  The cast also includes F. Murray Abraham, Josh Brolin, Charles S. Dutton, and Norman Reedus.
0871137380|5.0|Mark Bowden style, research, and documentation places him at the forefront of reporting on combat.  Bowden tackles all the sides and gives a voice for what really happened out there.  The film, though pretty accurate, lacks the depth of the book and so has nearly every other book on the military I have read.....  Interview those who were there!  Let the facts do the talking.  <br />An absolutely devastating tale told in a \\"you are there\\" fashion.
B00008PW3Q|5.0|The lyrical brilliance is amazing.  The whole cd is fantastic although I do agree with some of the reviewers that Buckingham is a person who experiments (part of the charm as he always HAS experimented)  However nothing can compare to the sheer BRILLIANCE of Stevie Nicks.  She sounds absolutely amazing and is a true lyrical GENIUS!  Also to add, Silvergirl is NOT a song she wrote about herself as some believe.  Stevie's songs go anywhere from slower heart-felt melodies (beautifully crafted), like Illume and Silvergirl, to more upbeat &quot;pop&quot; sounds like the title track, to pure untethered rock like Running Through the Garden and my personal favorite track Everybody Finds Out.<BR>I must admit that the omission of Christine McVie is not a heartbreak for me. I found most of her songs to be too candy coated and not lyrically deep.  Sometimes her keyboard playing reminded me of the Charlie Brown theme.  I think I am much happier getting more songs from Lindsey and Stevie. Sorry.  I have seen that my opinion is not a popular one when it comes to her and realize she is missed by many Mac fans.  <BR>I think that this is the BEST Mac album EVER!  Worth every penny to buy.  There is something on this album for almost everyone.  This album just pulls you in and makes you play it over and over.  You will have instant favorites from this brilliant new album.
B00005JLEU|5.0|&quot;Spirited Away&quot; -directed by Hayao Miyazaki (Princess Mononoke). This is an amazing and breathtaking Japanese animation. It puts Disney formulaic cartoons to shame. The art work is utterly charming with attention to detail. Spirited Away is nothing but charming without shamaltz or mushy sentimentality. From beginning to end, feels like a bizarre dream, never dull and always entertaining. I love it! All ages should watch this amazing animation and only watch this with the Japanese audio with subtitles, not with the dumbed down, Americanized dubbing! You'll be glad you did!
B00006LSM3|5.0|Its very unfortunate with the passing of George Harrison.  Although I appreciated the talents of all four former Beatles, I have a slight preference towards George Harrison's thoughtful style.  This Brainwashed CD surely is not a bunch of songs that were sitting around like leftovers.  All of them are good and many of them are just fabulous.<br />George is in fine form vocally and plays some soothing and stunning guitar solos.  The addition of the ukelele is very welcome.  Some good special effects exist on such songs as Rising Sun and Rocking Chair In Hawaii.  Jeff Lynne and Dhani Harrison did a good job of turning these great songs into a finely arranged finished product.<br />Certainly comparable to George's best work.
B00008PW3O|3.0|This album reads like two solo efforts crammed into one. And essentially that's what it is. You won't find a duet here or even much in the way of vocal harmony because this album is merely an evolution of what SHOULD have been(and was going to be) a Buckingham solo album. (And as a devoted fan of the guitarist, I would have been much happier had it not evolved into a Fleetwood Mac release, which is why I give it only 3 stars.)<BR>A previous reviewer made some comments about Lindsey's lyrical abilities, saying that they are, in a word, bizarre. But that's what I love about him. His words may not have the poetic quality that Stevie's songs carry, but they often have an equal amount of depth. And what he does not say in his lyrics he conveys in his music. <BR>As for the individual songs on the album- &quot;Come&quot;, &quot;Murrow Turning Over in His grave&quot;, &quot;Peacekeeper&quot;, &quot;Miranda&quot;, &quot;Illume&quot;, and &quot;Everybody Finds Out&quot; stand out in my mind. &quot;Come&quot; for jaw dropping instrumentation (and the obvious images the lyric &quot;think of me, sweet darlin', everytime you don't come&quot; brings to mind) . &quot;Murrow&quot; for Lindsey's stretching of his lyrical muscles. &quot;Peacekeeper&quot; for the same reason. &quot;Miranda&quot; for its just being a catchy song with great lyrics. &quot;Illume&quot; is a simple and haunting song, something Stevie hasn't produced in a long long time. As for &quot;Everybody Finds Out&quot;, it's just one of those songs you love to sing along to and Lindsey's grunts in the background bring a smile to your face. <BR>All in all, this is a great addition to the collection of any established fan of Fleetwood Mac. There really isn't a weak song here. However it doesn't have the same universal appeal that gave &quot;The Dance&quot; its great commercial success.
B00008DDXL|5.0|This movie is way better than the first one.  The Special effects are well done and the plot of the movie is 90% consistent with the book.  This movie is a must get for all those Harry Potter fans, and even if you are not you will almost guaranteed love this second installment of Harry Potter.
B000000WA4|5.0|If You are shopping for a Smashing Pumpkins fan and they dont have this-GET THEM IT.I think this one was the #1. cd in 1995 or 1996.Its a double Disk cd it has 28 songs .BUY IT its the best.
B00006CXXU|5.0|This CD really showcases Christina's talents, I love EVERY song on the CD. The songs on it are so different and unique and really show her growth as an artist. I would DEFINITELY recommend this CD to anyone who likes to listen to people with realy talent!
0688163173|5.0|I was under the impression that Lehane could not not outdo 'Darkness, Take My Hand' or 'Mystic River,' but this novel is simply brilliant. It is a mystey that will shock you throughout and leave you gasping for air with the twist at the end. What a novel!!!
B00008PW3O|5.0|The album was splendid, loved every track, especially Peacekeeper .  Seemed as though it was carefully put together. The lyrics were awesome, can't have enough of it.  This CD was spectacular just like the others. Best Cd yet.  Fleetwood Mac rocks!!
B00008H2LB|3.0|Linkin Park is a good band, don't get me wrong. I have been listening to them for quite some time. I listened to them back when they were under the name Xero...I was thoroughlly dismayed when ONe Step Closer got airplay on MTV and the like...Hybrid Theory was great, and MEteora comes close but falls short of the first, as many sophmore albums do. Reanimation was a piece of [junk] and I won't even talk about it. This will satisfy Linkin Park fans but it is nothing stellar, and it will not get ne news fans. But if you liked Hybrid Theory you'll love this. My faves are Faint, Nobody's Listening, Hit The Floor and Easier to run, which exhibits very good musicianship especially from Rob on drums. Chester and Rob should consider forming another band and ditching the other sub-par players. Maybe they could keep Joe he's mad cool. Anyway a solid album but nothing spectacular. If you like The Hard Hop stylings of Linkin Park you should also check out: (hed) P.E. <The original Rap Metal band>, 3rd Strike, E Town Concrete, and Bionic Jive.
B00005B36H|5.0|This would have to be the best tool album to date. Tool are one of the only if not the only rock band around that hasnt drop their standards in producing descent and original rock music. When i first put this album on and heard the first single &quot;The Grudge&quot; it just blew me away the intensity and the energy of the song is explosive. As the album progresses the song get better, from the grudge to the guitaring solo near the end &quot;Triad&quot;, which is a fast paced and energetic mix of awesome guitaring, bass and drumming. My advice, get this album. it would be a crime not to
B00005YJMX|5.0|Several great film makers and actors have had a go at the Dracula story since FW Murnau's stunning [[ASIN:B000055ZB8 Nosferatu: Eine Symphonie des Grauens]] in 1924, and each extrapolates something very different, but still bewitching, from the same raw material: And so it is that Werner Herzog's \\"Nosferatu - the Vampyre\\" - ostensibly a remake of Nosferatu itself - does nothing more than borrow the odd visual motif from Murnau.<br /><br />Nosferatu the Vampyre is decidedly an expressionist film so, if your interest lies in the bloodlust and suspense of the [[ASIN:0743477367 Dracula]] story, then look elsewhere: The only flowing blood you'll see - honestly - is when Jonathan Harker cuts his thumb. Instead, Herzog builds a haunting atmosphere through some quite startling cinematography. The credits roll over hundreds of desiccated cadavers arranged in a crypt; on his way to Castle Dracula Jonathan Harker struggles into the Carpathian Mountains against all nature can throw at him: verdant Romanian valleys give way to cathedralesque caverns, furious waterfalls, and still, through seemingly impassable mountain terrain, Harker battles on. But when we reach the castle, Kinski's morose portrayal of the Count, drawn on a psychic level to Lucy Harker, poses questions of a curiously more unsettling variety: Who is the victim in all this, and who is the predator? The lonely, pallid count, drawn like a wasp to the honey-pot or the seemingly pure-in-heart Lucy Harker, dressed head to toe in virginal white, but with tresses of black hair befitting a black widow? If you think I'm reading too much in to this, consider Lucy's makeup: it's virtually identical to Dracula's - sickly white skin and black, sunken eyes. And consider the outcome of the film (which I won't give away here).<br /><br />In its final twenty minutes Nosferatu really makes its mark, and one scene in particular gave me the willies: In Delft's main square, the Black Plague has taken hold, and Lucy runs through stray farm animals, miscellaneous household furniture and contaminated townsfolk who are intoxicatedly celebrating their own last hurrah. What makes the scene so striking is that it is totally silent (and thus reflective of the original Nosferatu), and accompanied by an extraordinary piece of polyphonic choral music. The credits don't mention it, and after about three days trying to track it down I've finally found it: it is a traditional Georgian folksong entitled Tsintsqaro (\\"At the Spring\\") which you may track down on the internet but not through Amazon.com. This confluence of music and images is perhaps one of the most haunting scenes Herzog has captured on film (which, given his gift for such scenes, is saying something).<br /><br />The DVD presentation is great - I don't think the English version of the film is significantly inferior to the German one (Adjani, who's French, was dubbed in both languages anyway) and in a couple of places had a nicer touch - Kinski's groan of irritation at laying eyes on a crucifix is funnier in the English version, for example. The commentary from Herzog is also well worth listening to. In other words, I have watched the same film three times in the last five days, and I'm still singing its praises!<br /><br />Olly Buxtoniscellaneous household furniture and contaminated townsfolk who are intoxicatedly celebrating their own last hurrah.

B00006JJ1O|1.0|This duo might have talent but it is hard to tell from this alblum.  As is far to common to pop the producer over uses synthetic effects to alter the voices of the singers.  While te music is fast and can be danced to it has a forced and artificial feel to it.  After listening to most of these songs once or twice the novelty has worn off and the CD is put back in its case to collect dust until the next garage sale
0151008116|5.0|I am generally a very unsatisfied reader.  I usually confine myself to &quot;classics&quot; or books that will enable me to learn about this subject or that subject.  These make for long reads with much delay in between sittings.  However, at the airport yesterday, I picked up this book because I had read about it in Time or Newsweek or some other publication so it qualified at least as timely.  I allowed myself to be pulled in by Martel's hypnotic prose and was so captivated that I awoke early this morning to finish off the rest of the book.<br />I won't try and delve into the inner meanings of this book, although they are fun to think about as you read.  This book is enjoyable on many different levels.  It is a very easy and quick read, and I can't say enough about the author's skill with words. The passages are beautiful and fun.  If you feel like a light read with some heavy overtones that you can think about when you wish without becoming bogged down in them, this book is for you.
B00008PW3Q|5.0|This album may shock, anger, appall or pleasantly surprise you. I would vote for the latter for most people if they REALLY listen to it. You get many different sounds, there's pop, rock, country and even Chinese influences. Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks share equal songwriting billing on this new Fleetwood Mac album. Christine McVie has retired and is not involved (except for some background vocals and a little bit of keys) in this album. <br />What's the World Coming To: This is a pure pop number from Buckingham, one reminiscent of Second Hand News or Monday Morning. Opens the album very nicely.<br />Murrow: This is one of the shocker songs. It's got a SEARING guitar solo and the lyrics are murky and moody. I think Murrow would turn over in his grave if he heard this song! Lindsey has done well with growing as a songwriter and his guitar skills only show us that he is THE most underrated guitarist EVER. <br />Illume: One of the most unique songs on the album. This song is a tribute to September 11th. It's not a ballad though, and boasts some very strong vocals from Ms. Nicks. This song is pronounced E-loo-may..by the way.<br />Thrown Down: Great lyrics and terrific production for this Stevie number. It's a pop gem!<br />Miranda: Nice guitar, funky beat and it's a catchy lil number.<br />Red Rover: This song is the best on the album, in my opinion. The guitaring skills of Lindsey are HIGHLY UNDERRATED and this song should prove that. The lyrics are a mystery and his voice soars.<br />Say You Will: The title track is the Fleetwood Mac we've all grown to love. It's got a terrific hook and should be the second single from the album. <BR> <BR>Peacekeeper: This is the first single and it's already a hit on the radio and internet. This one is very catchy as well and has great harmonies from Lindsey and Stevie. Contrary to popular belief, this song is NOT about war/peace, it's about relationships.<br />Come: This song sounds similar to Tango in the Night from 1987, in that it's soft during the verses, but the chorus and CRAZY guitar solo at the end are loud and powerful!! Add in provocative lyrics and you have a song that young people will salivate over!<br />Smile at You: Another unique song in that the production is unlike anything you've heard from the Mac before. It's got Chinese influences in the guitar part at the end. Listen for John \\"the Monster\\" McVie's powerful bass.<br />Running Through the Garden: This is a nice rocker of a song with a Buckingham guitar solo. Fun to sing along with too. <br />Silver Girl: The weak link in this extremely strong album. The production is good, but Stevie's lyrics aren't the greatest ever. Not a bad song, just the weakest of the bunch.<br />Steal Your Heart Away: Nice melodies and a softness during the hecticness of Buckingham's other songs, this is a sweet, romantic song.<br />Bleed to Love Her: A studio version of the song heard on The Dance. Polished with a longer fadeout. This is another slow ballad from Lindsey.<br />Everybody Finds Out: Stevie outdoes herself on this song. It's rock and roll at it's finest and should be played in clubs everywhere. This song has tons of attitude and it's the Stevie we all know and love who wrote rock hits like Edge of 17 and Stand Back.<br />Destiny Rules: Has a country vibe to it and with great lyrics by Ms. Nicks, this is one of her strongest songs on the album.<br />Say Goodbye: The guitars, along with Lindsey's whispery vocals make this song a nice almost closer, coupled with Goodbye Baby.<br />Goodbye Baby: This is one of those songs where you need a box of tissues to listen to it. Stevie's soft lullaby vocals are enough to make you cry, and the lyrics will drive you over the edge to full on sobbing.<br />All in all, one of the Mac's strongest efforts in that it is contemporary with a hint of nostalgia for those who love Rumours.
0767805712|5.0|Made by the same director of The Truman Show, Gattaca, a  film set in \\"the not too distant future,\\" shows how humankind's blind faith in technology and genetic science will compel us to create a two-tier system of the human race: the genetically enhanced, \\"Valids,\\" and the nonenchanced, \\"Invalids.\\" Gattaca is a world where humans are no longer measured by their moral character but rather by their DNA, their genetic code. Dating, jobs, health insurance, reproductive rights are all monitored by the government, which wants to keep the \\"Valids\\" pure and uncontaminated. Our protagonist, an \\"Invalid,\\" must use his human spirit--courage, love, tenacity, cunning--to transcend the strictures the government has imposed on him. More specifically, he wants to live out his dream of space travel, but he has to assume the identity of a \\"Valid,\\" and the movie goes to great lengths showing us the pains our hero suffers in order to live out his charade. Thus the movie pits human character against blind faith in science in a film that, without ever preaching to us, shows the dangers of dehumanization in a world where technlogogy is supposed to lead us to Paradise.

There's not a song on here that isn't amazing. The audio quality is excellent. I wish Sepultura's more recent exploits were this grand. <br />This is the epitome of HEAVY METAL. You won't be dissapointed.

Powerful dialogue. Tender romance scenes too. Once again James Horner's music (with the bagpipes) is outstanding.

B00008J4P5|5.0|I really thought this duo would have a tough time following up &quot;White Blood Cells&quot;.  The critical acclaim was huge, maybe a bit too much so for an album that had some weak points, making the expectations for &quot;Elephant&quot; huge.  But they really surprised me by far surpassing anything they had done before...<BR>'Seven Nation Army' lets you know immediately that this is a band that isn't afraid to push its boundaries and display a level of musical maturity that they hadn't shown before.  From there, they show their wide array of influences, beautifully blending rock, folk, and blues in varyting quantities.  There really are too many highlights to list, but a personal favourite is 'Hypnotise'.  It's an awful lot like 'Fell in Love with a Girl', but with a few minor chords thrown in to give it a darker feel....<BR>What can I say, i LOVE this album....
B00005JLEU|2.0|OK...first of all, I bought this movie after reading all the positive, praising reviews on here, and was, for the first time on here, let down by them. As a fan of PRINCESS MONONOKE, I bought this dvd on a whim...thinking it would have the same captivating enthralling story, beautiful animation, and positive symbolism...HOWEVER, I have watched this movie three times since purchasing it and still sit through it with the same furrowed brow expression and confused look on my face every time. I DON'T GET THIS MOVIE! The plot is so unbelievably thin and boring that it actually ruins the beautiful animation of the film! I liked a lot of the symbolism in this movie though...The plot points that dealt with greed(the parents over-indulging in the food of the spirits, only to turn into pigs for there glutiny), love (Chihiro caring so much for Haku to give him her magical gift from the river spirit), and laziness (Chihiro quickly adapting to the spirit world and working hard without complaining)were interesting and nicely put together in the film. I would have thoroughly enjoyed this movie if it wasn't for the extreme dry spells in the dialogue and story line. There were too many long, drawn out sequences that were just unnecessary that had me rolling my eyes and practically falling asleep. Chihiro's voice was enough to make me want to bash my own head into the tv set to make it stop, and I don't think I will EVER understand NO FACE-the weird, disturbing white masked spirit who wreaks havoc in the bathhouse of the spirit world-but has some sort of otherworldy love interest with Chihiro because she lets him in, thinking he is a customer. I just don't get it. The art in the movie is fine...I have no complaints about that part. This movie was a disapointment though. I was expecting something whimsical and fun and this was just disturbing and dull. I am planning on RENTING Castle In The Sky or Kiki's Special Delivery Service, in hopes of finding anime that is more light hearted and enjoyable-that has characters that I can actually invest some emotians into...The characters of Spirited Away were boring, distant, and emotianally hollow....I almost hoped that Chihiro would be stuck in that world and forced to eat her butchered pig parents...that would have made the movie more interesting at least...d enjoyable-that has characters that I can actually invest some emotians into...The characters of Spirited Away were boring, distant, and emotianally hollow....I almost hoped that Chihiro would be stuck in that world and forced to eat her butchered pig parents...that would have made the movie more interesting at least...

I hope that if you like the movie, you will like the book, as it explains the story of these soldiers in an accurate and dare I say honorable fashion.<br />After watching the movie I felt nothing. But after reading the book, I was moved by their story.<br />The acting was very medicore.<br />They should have never put those wives in the movie either.
B00005ATQD|4.0|Nicole Kidman & Tom Cruise are the Harfords...a young couple with their own desires...not only for each other, but for other people. Alice (Kidman) tells her husband about a sexual fantasy she once had a long time ago. That provokes William (Cruise) to fulfill his sexual fantasy by entering the sexual underground by almost sleeping with a hooker and visiting a sex cult for the night. However, its beats me why a man who has a wife as PIPING HOT & SEXY as Nicole Kidman would go look somewhere else to sexual pleasure. I sure wouldn't. I'd stay home. A very erotic story with lots of twists.

B00008973Q|2.0|I can't believe it.  I have been cheated twice now.  The first edition of Ran was terrible.  The new \\"Hi-Def\\" version is disappointingly mediocre.<br />It just isn't very good.  Sure, now it has the right geometry on a widescreen TV and they fixed the horrible centering issue, but the quality of the video is very MEDIOCRE and sometimes POOR.  For one thing, the color seems like it is overdone and unnatural.  Secondly, the overall picture is often fuzzy, though sometimes acceptable.  Thirdly, there are \\"sparklies\\" all over the place, where complex shapes or fine lines are PIXELLATED HORRIBLY and broken, causing vibrating movements and undulating saturation.  I find this nearly intolerable.<br />If you have a widescreen TV, you'll surely notice this.  If you have an old \\"standard\\" set that isn't too big, it might hide some of this in the \\"fuzziness\\" of the scanlines, but probably not all of it.<br />I am just very angry that this supposed chance at doing the film justice has been totally wasted.  I saw Ran IN A THEATRE and it was FANTASTIC. Not so on the DVD.  It looks like [poo].<br />Here is a letter I wrote to the deplorable company Wellspring, which apparently handled this ...job:To Whom it may concern:<br />I have a technical problem with the new edition of Ran, \\"The Masterworks Edition\\".<br />Basically edges and lines in the picture tend to vibrate and jitter, and are very pixellated, causing a distutrbing and distracting motion and distortion in the overall image.  It actually gives me a headache to watch it.<br />I find it hard to believe that you would go through the trouble to produce a new \\"Hi-Def\\" transfer and basically do such a poor job with the transfering and compression of the video.<br />I returned the first copy I bought at Virgin Records for another one, and the same problem exists on both.  I have a Toshiba widescreen HDTV television for enjoying just such movies as this, and I am shocked that the picture is so grainy and problematic.<br />Can youexplain this?  I have included some screen shots for you to look at.  The first set is where the Lords are meeting for the first time.  The four frames to show how the star in the crescent of the clan symbol distorts and \\"sparkles.\\"  See the white rectangles and compare the regions.  Some are darker in spots, some are lighter.  They are all \\"splotchy\\".  When you put frame after frame up like this, you get a \\"sparkling\\" effect, which is very annoying.<br />In the second set, the white rectangles highlight the \\"sparkling\\" in the white lines in Hidetora's hat.  You can clearly see that in some frames the line is \\"solid\\" and in other frames it is clearly \\"broken\\" or \\"perferated.\\"  Again, this creates a disturbing effect in motion.<br />I'm not sure what you can do about this, but I have to say I'm disappointed in your compression techniques or whatever filters you ran this through.<br />Any information in answer to this problem would be appreciated.  At the very least, perhaps future DVD's done by your company will not have this problem.
0312305060|4.0|As someone who did not read Virginia Woolf voluntarily, I was surprised at how much I liked this novel.  I've always enjoyed Virginia Woolf's language, but her pace was too slow for my taste.  I did not have the same problem with 'The Hours'.  Michael Cunningham maintains a good momentum as he depicts a day in the life of his three heroines without sacrificing the rich textured language.  And with realistic modern day side characters, like Clarissa's straight yet uber liberal daughter, Julia, Cunningham make his novel interesting to me in a way that Mrs. Dalloway never was.
B000084T18|4.0|As I have said many times in the past, I am not the big rap fan I once was in high school.  I really don't like most of the new rap that's coming out, because they all sound the same.  They all seem to have that \\"I'm rich and blah-blah-blah\\" attitude.  So I very rarely buy rap albums anymore.<br />However, I did pick up a copy of 50 Cent's \\"Get Rich or Die Tryin',\\" and I have to say I'm impressed.  Is it different from most of the rap albums out today?  Not really.  What IS different is while others fail in their execution, this one almost hits the dime every time (no pun intended).  I found this album to be pretty addicting.  It takes awhile for it to grow on you, but when it does you can't get it out of your head.<br />A word of warning to those who don't like violent music; this is NOT an album for you.  It has everything from drugs to violence; from sex to murder; from drug deals to hits, and so on and so on.  He does tend to brag about his money from time to time, but nowhere to the extent that everybody at Cash Money does.  And I think 50 Cent has much more interesting things to say than most rappers.  You can definitely see the 2-Pac influence in the way he rhymes and constructs his delivery.<br />For the most part, the album's pretty solid.  There really isn't a song that I disliked, although there's some I listen to a lot more than others.  Those songs would be \\"in da club,\\" \\"patiently waiting,\\" \\"many men (wish death),\\" \\"if I can't,\\" \\"heat,\\" \\"back down,\\" \\"blood hound,\\" and \\"don't push me.\\"<br />The only drawback to this album is the hype that surrounds it.  It's this that I fear will bring the album down the most.  While I don't dispute it's a great album, I believe that it has been hyped up A LOT.  If you read some of the negative reviews, that's the primary reason for them not being able to enjoy the album.  I have to agree, I think it tends to get a lot more attention than it should.  However, it's still a really good album and I don't believe that hype has damaged it that much, but it is still a determining factor in liking the album or not for most.<br />\\"Get Rich or Die Tryin'\\" is a raw album with \\"gangsta\\" written all over it.  If you like rap, then there is a really good chance that you'll like it.  As I said, it took a bit for it to grow on me, but when it did I found myself humming the songs to myself.  50 Cent has potential and is able to reveal that on this album.  I'll be curious to see what his next project holds for him.e has damaged it that much, but it is still a determining factor in liking the album or not for most.<br />\\"Get Rich or Die Tryin'\\" is a raw album with \\"gangsta\\" written all over it.

B000089A07|4.0|I've read RED DRAGON, THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, AND HANNIBAL, and I must say I would rank this movie above Hannibal and right below The Silence of the lambs.  It follows the book as does the previous movies, and thank heavens I now have a movie to replace the awful MANHUNTER--a movie that was made in the 80s, which is quite pathetic.  Red Dragon is Hannibal's first appearence in the series, and in the book his part is very short; so, obviously to make the picture more appealing to a wider-variety of people, Hannibal had to encompass a larger part.  The movie is watchable and very fluid, as in the plot hits on all cylinders.  Anthony Hopkins is, as always, magnificent as Hannibal,and Edward Norton does a good job.  This, although not the best movie in the series, is a very good movie that should be on everyone's list to buy.  I would recommend watching the series in order--RED DRAGON, SILENCE, AND HANNIBAL, and I would also recommend buying all the books.
B00008PW3Q|5.0|I am a relatively newcomer to Fleetwood Mac. 1997's Dance helped to reintroduce me to many of their greatest works. I as of yet have not obtained every Mac album or have even heard every song. Still, this album delivers for me.<br />Every track on this album has something to offer. The music is deep and complex. The voices are used and considered an instrument in the production. The use of stereo is splendid. I imagine the dvd-a version is oustanding as well. <br />The bass and percussion are oustanding as always.  Lindsey continues to shine and make me wonder why he doesnt get more praise for his talents on the guitar.  Stevie's &quot;mystic&quot; sound and lyrics astound. When her songs are given to Lindsey and &quot;Mac'd&quot; its pure magic.<br />There is something on this album for everyone.  There are tracks that feature the &quot;classic&quot; mac sound only they can do.  There are pure rockers that will shatter ear drums when played live. There is even a song i could see being played in dance clubs around the country. The final track on the album is a sweet song by Stevie that touches you in the heart no matter how much you fight it. One of her most beautiful works.<br />Christie is missed. On a few of the songs i can imagine how she would sound performing them. She may have brought a bit more balance to the album overall.<br />Still, this album is a gem. It is stong enough to satisfy loyal fans while new enough to bring in many more. Its not pop, rock, blues, or country.  Its fleetwood mac. They are truly a genre of their own. Enough said.
B000083E79|5.0|This is the first cd by Cher I have ever owned and I think it is great. It has all the good songs plus a few i've never heard before, which i could have done without, but still I really love the cd, She's one fantastic lady after all these years and I think she looks great as a blonde btw. I would recommend this cd.
B000001FSR|5.0|This album is by far the best out of all the great albums Waits has produced. If you aren't that familiar with Waits' material give this a few listens before judging. You won't be disappointed.
6304806426|5.0|I watched it seven times--within a week--not counting the interminable successive replays of favorite chapters. Ralph Fiennes is arguably the finest actor of our generation. His portrayal of Count Almasy is posessed of depth, sensitivity, and subtlty as well as passionate intensity. These qualities are, indeed, the hallmarks of all of Mr. Fiennes' work, and this performance is replete with each of them, as well as with the evidence of the technical refinement of a superb classically-trained actor. The directing, cinematography, and editing are equal to the task set for them, as is every single member of the cast. The result is haunting and unforgettable.
B00005B4GU|3.0|It was a great CD, but I feel that Radioheads band members were pushing themselves too hard to further implement the musical style pioneered on &quot;kid A&quot;. They are no doubt, a band that continues to change with each album, but what I think upsets most people about Amnesiac is the &quot;hard to rock out to&quot; nature of the album. It's filled with melodic, techno-influenced songs that can often be very relaxing if you give them a chance. I give it a three because I simply don't like it in comparison to some of their other albums, although it is a beautiful display of Radiohead's artwork.
B000069AUI|5.0|I immensely enjoyed Coldplay's first album &quot;Parachutes&quot; when it first came out and when bands like Coldplay and Travis was all the rage and being compared to Radiohead. Over time my tastes in music has taken a left turn for the darker and more intense sounds of KMFDM and VNV Nation. And as much as I enjoyed &quot;In My Place&quot; when it first came out last year, I wasn't really sure if I was going to get &quot;A Rush of Blood to the Head&quot;. &quot;In My Place&quot; is a beautiful song. But over the past couple of months I have really started getting into the singles &quot;Clocks&quot; and &quot;The Scientist&quot;. &quot;The Scientist&quot; is what really changed my mind about &quot;A Rush of Blood to the Head&quot;. I came upon &quot;A Rush of Blood to the Head&quot; in the used cd bins at my favorite record store and quickly snatched it up. I knew full well that there wouldn't be another song as catchy and infectious as &quot;Yellow&quot; when I bought the cd today so my expectations were pretty low key. I understand now why &quot;A Rush of Blood to the Head&quot; was listed as the best album of 2002 with a lot of music critics. The band has quickly established itself that they are no flash-in-the-pan act like Oasis and Travis (sadly enough to say). I absolutely loved the beautiful, lush ballad of &quot;God Put a Smile Upon Your Face&quot;. That definitely is one of the best songs Coldplay has put out. Like I said before, &quot;The Scientist&quot; is the song that made me want to buy &quot;A Rush of Blood to the Head&quot;. It is simply one of my favorite songs at the moment, and one of the few decent songs that radio is playing right now. Most people probably were expecting for Coldplay to fall flat on their face with their second album. Thankfully the band proved their critics wrong and released an excellent album of catchy pop/rock songs that will stand the test of time. I'm glad I changed my mind about this album and this band. I foresee a bright future for this band.t future for this band.
B00008PW3Q|2.0|At least that way, the band would have been honest about what they were representing with this latest effort. <br />I saw a recent inteview with Lindsey Buckingham (whom I consider a near genius) where he said that the band wasn't &quot;missing anything musically&quot; with the subtraction of Christine McVie.<br />Excuse me Lindsey?! That is just flat out wrong.  Her presence is SORELY lacking in this effort. This album cries out for Christine McVie's pristine vocals, integral keyboards and pop- oriented contributions. <br />There are a handful of &quot;likeable&quot; songs on this album, but ultimately nothing memorable in the way of &quot;Silver Springs,&quot; for example. <br />I agree with other reviewers who said this album is simply too long. Lots of &quot;filler.&quot; It has a sharp edge to it that would have been smoothed out nicely by Christine McVie. Again, I can't help but get back to that comment by Buckingham. How he can say that they aren't missing anything musically w/o McVie? Astonishing. <br />I almost gave it 3 stars, but as a decades long fan of Mac...I'm finding this album *very* hard to like.  And to make matters worse, I plunked down 80$ too see them in May.
B00005N9CV|5.0|Following the success of her two previous albums, Love scenes and When I look in your eyes, Diana recorded another album in similar style. It doesn't quite make the same impact, but that may be due to raised expectations because this is still a high quality album.<br />Diana has once again selected songs from the Great American Songbook to fill the album, though this time she also has included a sixties song, The look of love, which was a hit for Dusty Springfield, and a fifties song, Cry me a river, which was a hit for Julie London.<br />S'wonderful was originally a top five American hit in 1928 for the long-forgotten Frank Crumit. Love letters was a hit for its writer, Dick Haymes, in 1946, but only really became popular when Ketty Lester covered it in the sixties and had a huge international hit with it. Elvis Presley and Alison Moyet have also had huge hits with their covers. I remember you is another 1940's song that waited for the sixties to gain popularity, this time via a Frank Ifield cover.<br />Diana sings these songs as well as anybody, and also plays piano on all tracks. However, all tracks feature either the London symphony orchestra or the Los Angeles session orchestra, so Diana does not get the chance to show just what she can do with a piano.<br />This is a wonderful album that confirms Diana as the leading jazz lady in the world today.
B00004T9UF|5.0|... The things that Eminem says in his music may be making him rich beyond anyone's belief, but more than that he actually has something to say.  It may not be a positive message of any kind, it may not change or heal the world, or make anyone feel better.  But, if anything, it has probably helped the man, Marshal Mathers himself, cope with his past and make it through his own depression, releasing his frustrations onto an unsuspecting world.  As hateful as some of his words maybe, he is, in his own right, an artist.  It may shock, surprise, infuriate, and humor us all, but to him it means something.  Not only is his flow original, and his style unique, but he transends race. ... Eminem's music is nothing less than pure genius.  No one can take that talent from him, not after what he's been through.  There's a reason he's been around in Hip-Hop as long as he has been--he's earned it, and we like it.
B00008PW3Q|3.0|I have been waiting for this CD for a long time.  My initial impression is that the CD is way too long.  18 songs are too many.  Too many songs sound like experimental recordings.  Having said all that, this CD has some very catchy songs.  \\"Say You Will\\" and \\"Peacekeeper\\" are the most radio friendly songs.  I also enjoyed \\"Steal Your Heart Away\\".  \\"Running Through the Garden\\" was the strongest song.  <br />Both Stevie Nicks' and Lindsey Buckingham's vocals sound somewhat toned down for this CD.  Obviously, Christine McVie is missing from the line up and it shows.  I will not say I was disappointed, but I cannot say I was totally impressed by this CD.  I may change my mind when I listen to this more.
B00005JLK1|2.0|If you've seen the movie, you'll know what I'm about to describe is the most ridiculous opening to a horror film ever:  This movie opens with lightly toned, whimsical music and PINK CALLIGRAPHY opening credits!!  I mean, What The Hell?  I thought it might be a spoof opening, but it wasn't.  I couldn't believe that a horror flick could even TRY and do this.<br />The plot was so-so, but I can't understand why Julianna Marguleise and Gabriel Byrne would have accepted the script?  They must have needed the money.  Anyway, there were a few cool and new effects and horrific ways to kill folk.<br />I think the most horrifying point of this movie is the overall production.
B00004X01U|5.0|Madonna began her recording career with an album aimed firmly at the disco market, and while she has recorded albums in a variety of styles, she has never forgotten her roots and this album is proof of that. Many of the lyrics reflect Madonna's mood at the time the album was created - very much in love with her husband.<br />This album contains four major international hits - Music, Don't tell me, What it feels like for a girl and American pie. It came as a total surprise to me when I learned that Madonna had covered Don McLean's classic song. Madonna rarely records covers and I never imagined this to be her type of song. Yet it works brilliantly, although Madonna's dance version sounds very different from Don's folksy original.<br />Apart from American pie, my favorite tracks are in the middle of this CD - I deserve it, Amazing and Nobody's perfect - but the whole album is another masterpiece in the career of the most successful lady in pop music history.
0316776963|5.0|What a funny book!  Sedaris has a way to entice the reader and hold their attention.  He speaks of his childhood anf family life, joking about how disfunctional they were. Each chapter is another story from Sedaris's life from childhood to living in Paris.  I laughed out loud the whole time. I would recommmend reading Naked. It's just as good.
6300214044|5.0|This is a wonderful tribute to a man who recieved no love or understanding in life. And so in death we honor his memory. He was not retarded and had no metal defects of any kind. How can one possible imagine being born with a terrible birth defect then let alone today? Ask yourself how would you treat a person like this is you saw them on the street? Would you snicker or scream and run away? Or would you become their friend? This is a great movie and one of my very favorites! I still cannot see this movie and not cry because of the way this wonderful man was treated by a socitey that did not understand him and who did not dare to try. Watch it you'll love it!!!
B00008DDXC|5.0|Only one word can desribe the Harry Potter movies and books: incredible- that is, incredibly GOOD! I will agree with other people, that the Harry Potter books are better than the movies, but still, these Harry Potter movies make The Lord of the Rings (LOTR) look like a horrible movie, because it is so much better. <BR>     See, the Harry Potter movies don't get boring, because right when it starts to get all quiet, something goes wrong, leading to another great action sequence with great special effects. And you have to admit, in (LOTR) a 3.5 hour movie, you can't help falling asleep during the parts in which everything is being explained. In Harry Potter, the explanations are INTERESTING, and never too long, and ALWAYS lead right up to an action sequence. For example, when Hermione asks Prof. McGonnagle about the Chamber of Secrets, there is an explanation, but before you know it, before it can get boring, the Quidditch match (a wizard game on brooms) begins. Now, enough about LOTR and Harry Potter, because we already know the better movie and book... ::COUGH:: HARRY POTTER!<BR>       If there was one complaint I had to make about this movie, it would be the lacking of a schoolish atmosphere in the movies, which you feel in the books. The movies don't really show how Ron and Harry sometimes give up school to go on adventures, and how Hermione always tries to keep them from trouble, and is ALWAYS studying. <BR>      I absolutely love Dobby, and think he is my favorite animated creature, with Gollum right behind. Dobby's ways of punishing himself make you laugh, no matter how much you try not to. This movie is alot better than the first Harry Potter movie, so go and see this even if you didn't like to first one, because you thought the first one was too kiddish, because this one is not. The special effects are greater than the first one's, improving on the Quidditch. The music is beautiful, too.<BR>        <BR>The special effects, music, actors, and epic storyline add up to making a movie that is sure to be one of those classic movies you'll want to show your kids when you grow up! In other words, DO NOT miss your chance to buy the ultimate movie of all time (UNTIL THE NEXT HARRY POTTER COMES OUT, THIS MOVIE IS THE BEST MOVIE EVER!).
0425188809|5.0|This is about the 8th Koontz novel I have read and it really was a great book to read.  The action keeps you from beginning to end and does not get tiresome.  You can basically get an idea what the book is about from above and from other reviews, so I am just going to recommend to read this book if you haven't.  If you haven't read Koontz, start with this one.  I also highly recommend BY Light of the Moon, and also Tick Tock if you are looking for a more humorous, lighter read.
B00008PW3Q|4.0|This cd was a pretty long one so there are a few songs that are duds-mostly Lindsey's. Red Rover, Come, Murrow turning over, Miranda, and Say Goodbye sounds like something from his Solo albums which really [stinks]. Record sales prove it. Lindsey did surprise me on a few songs. Whats The World Coming to, Peacekeeper, and Steal Your Heart Away were good. After all he has had over 10 years. Stevie's songs were good for the most part. Say You Will, the catchy Thrown Down (a left over from the Exelent Trouble In Shangri-La) Running Through The Garden and Everybody Finds Out really rocked. Illume could have been better it just goes to show how bad Lindsey's production can mess up a good song. Destiny Rules is a dark song and Good bye Baby is a very moving ballad. The only dud of hers was Silver Girl which I thought was pretty autobiographal and Smile at You was kind of to kreepy. I think most people will have to do a lot of skipping and auto programing.
6300216039|5.0|This is a movie with virtually no flaws -- the casting is superb, the story is, of course, classic, and the settings are beautifully rustic.  Even the music is perfect.
B000001Y5J|5.0|Broken is great. On the back of the EP, it read that only six songs could be found on the disc. As it turns out, there are actually two hidden tracks, \\"Physical\\" and \\"Suck\\", which are just as good as the other tracks. The songs \\"Pinion\\" and \\"Help Me I Am In Hell\\" are just short instrumentals, but they aren't bad. \\"Happiness in Slavery\\" is one of the best NIN songs I've ever heard, and it's definently a favorite. This EP is almost worth buying for that song alone. If you are a NIN fan who wants to hear a different sound from the band, get Broken.
B00008NRL8|5.0|Memorable. Desde el momento en que se abre el disco y hasta el final -un tanto gaucho-, sabes que el sonido (instantáneamente clásico) de Gotan Project no lo olvidarás. Bases rítmicas sobrias acompañan al bandoneón, cuerdas y piano en un viaje por las cashesitas de BsAs y París. Samples muy bien escogidos, adornan tracks, sin perder el norte de la música. Es mucho más música que &quot;el festival de los efectos&quot;, como lamentablemente sucede con frecuencia en la música electrónica.<br />&quot;Queremos Paz&quot;, &quot;Música Brutal&quot;, &quot;Tríptico&quot; y una notable versión del &quot;Ultimo Tango en Paris&quot; de Gato Barbieri, hacen de La Revancha del Tango un disco para viajar, incluso si no quieres moverte del lugar en donde estás.<br />Aguante, Astor Piazzola :)
0140131558|4.0|This book has the rare combination of qualities that qualify it as re-readable.  There is enough fibre to it to allow digestion to occur over a long period of time, and each reading will reveal new perspectives. <BR>If at first you're confused and think you've stumbled onto some sort of high-art form of detective novels, you've basically got the right idea. Fortunately, Auster goes much deeper, weaving an intricate and complex thread throughout the stories of this trilogy. Though each can stand on the strength of its tale on its own, together they form a triptych which forces you as the reader to continually refer to each portion again and again.
B000056JYB|4.0|As far as I am concerned, the main reason for buying a 2 CD Deluxe Edition set of the Blind Faith album was that it offered two versions of the song, &quot;Can't Find My Way Home.&quot;  I also have a single CD version of the album, which fits more easily into the space where I usually keep my CDs, so I am much more likely to just play the single set of six songs.  While I'm listening to it, though, my mind sneaks back through my long history with this music and manages to tell me:  But This Is Not All!  All I really miss, though, is on the eleven-selections first CD of the Deluxe Edition set:  Two versions of &quot;Can't Find My Way Home&quot; and two previously unreleased recordings of the song, &quot;Sleeping In the Ground.&quot;  If you have only heard the original Blind Faith album, &quot;Can't Find My Way Home&quot; was only 3 minutes, 17 seconds.  If ever a song was good enough to be longer than that, the song deserves the full 5 minutes, 40 seconds that the electric version on the Deluxe Edition provides.  I consider the longer version simpler.  The electric guitar part is distinct and stands out, instead of being compressed into a mix where everything gets lost.  With electric guitar, &quot;Can't Find My Way Home&quot; gains extra melodies that fit the music better than what most people heard with the original version, if they could hear much of anything.<br />&quot;Sleeping In The Ground&quot; has a quick 2 minutes, 49 seconds version and a slow blues version of 4 minutes, 44 seconds.  I would much rather hear the same song a couple times than listen to all the instrument jams that go over an hour in total time, but I might be considered simplistic for desiring to connect some theme with the music I listen to.  I get tired of listening to music that doesn't bring me back to something I can understand, which only 4 or 5 songs on the original album did.  The Deluxe Edition gets me up to 6 songs I'm really fond of.  And it isn't much bigger than the standard plastic jewel case.plastic jewel case.
B00008PW3Q|4.0|I'll tell you...I'm not as familiar with Fleetwood Mac's music as a great many other people. Sure I'd heard The Chain, Lies, Tusk and the others they're known for. But truth be told, I was authentically sold on Fleetwood Mac with The Dance. I have a great appreciation for bands than can wail live. And F.M. can. It's clear by watching The Dance on DVD that everything that's going on is real. There's no trickery. No overdub nonsense. Just really great, really seasoned musicians doing what they truly do best. And Lindsey Buckingham? Man! Way to bring it, bro! For my money, it gets no better than his acoustic rendition of Go Insane...a song not on the CD, but included on the video. It's one of his own songs, and it's so brilliant, it almost makes me weep to listen to it.<br />So here's the thing. Without a moment's hesitation, I bought Say You Will. Is it good? Sure it is. These are talented people. And I don't think I miss Christine McVie. But I have to complain that F.M. seem uncomfortable making a studio album that has any kind of live feel. The production is brilliant...so much so that it's completely flat. No sign that humans went in, stepped in front of a mic, and recorded what they sang. That's unfortunate, because F.M. isn't a band that needs to cover for flaws in their abilities.<br />It's possibly most evident on Bleed To Love Her, a song we all had the unusual chance to hear live first, and studio recorded second. So for 4 years, they only way we knew this song was how it was done on stage. And sadly, Say You Will's version is so labbed up and so played with, it's lost that feel...you know that feel...it's gone.<br />So in the end, this album is good. Don't get me wrong. From a songwriting sense, great. But it's unfortunate that F.M. seem uncomfortable with allowing some raw energy to come through in a studio recording. If they did, then we'd really have something.<br />Cheers!
031286504X|5.0|Beautifully (and sorrowfully) written, this stands as my favorite novel by Richard Matheson. The tragic tale of Robert Neville, the last human in a world of vampires is chillingly real, bringing in a new concept into the world of vampirism. Not based heavily on the legend of vampires like Dracula, but rather on a mysterious condition that leads to vampiric behavior and the results of such.<br />The survival of the last human in the world, former soldier Robert Neville is the sole focus of the novel. An incident in his past has made him immune to the disease that has overthrown the human population, leaving him to do the dirty word of getting rid of it. During the night, he barricades himself in his home, hoping the sun would come sooner. Throughout the day, he lays waste to the afflicted he finds. For you see, living alone in the world where everyone wants a chunk of you leads to some rather necessary changes to your lifestyle. The world that Matheson builds is exceptional, to the point that it becomes frighteningly real and you feel the joy and remorse of Robert as he struggles in a world out to get him.<br />A surprising mix of horror and tragedy, one has plenty of time and reason to feel for our poor Robert and his failing crusade. A lusciously-written novel that is, indeed, legend.
B00001W0G6|4.0|After a lot of anticipation, I finally rented La Dolce Vita. I was a touch intimidated by the two tape set, and was worried that I wouldn't be interested enough to get through it. But, I popped in tape 1 anyway, with a mingled sense of fear and excitement. Though unsure of what I was getting myself into, I was hoping for the promised unforgettable experience.<br />As the movie began, I searched for the beginnings of a conceivable story line. Not so much a setting or a character, but of an introduction that would change the story. I searched for this, in vain, for the rest of the film. As the credits began to roll, what this movie was became clear to me. It was not the journey of a man changing because problem A appeared and he chose route X to fix it, like most movies. It was to be appreciated for the gradual change that took place throughout the course of the film. No one event or meeting changed the circumstances for our main character, but, as in life, a series of events that are seemingly unrelated, apart from who they involved.<br />Marcello Mastroianni was masterful in the role of the reporter, in search of scandals who gradually becomes apart of the crowd he once wrote about.<br />The movie didn't keep me entirely interested throughout, not only because of its large running time, but also because some points of the \\"slice of life\\" story were merely dry. Yet, there was an inexplicable feeling of depression when the movie ended...somehow, leaving this sex, suicide and alcohol-driven universe that had at so many points bored me, was like losing a friend. As with all good movies, the minute you are cut off from the world it took you into, a sense of loss is felt.<br />La Dolce Vita, while not always fast-moving, nor interesting nor funny, is a masterwork of its own sort. It drips of flavor, rhythm, sex and life, while Fellini's camera never once wanders into the dangerous realm of objectivity.
B00008J4P5|5.0|This is the best Cd ever i enjoy most of the songs.  Here is my list  <BR>1. Seven Nation Army (20/10) i give this song extra points since it is the first single and it has a good tune. I also love it since it sounds like some british rock. SWEET Song<BR>2.Black Math(9/10) Great Beat <BR>3.There's no home for you here(8/10) another well done job<BR>4.I just don't know what to do with myself(8/10) Jack sounds like one of the Beatles<BR>5.In the cold,cold night(10/10) Meg has a good voice<BR>6.I want to be the boy to warm your mother's heart(6/10) a little weird<BR>7.You've got her in your pocket(9/10) Great Song <BR>8.Ball and Biscuit(10/10) Great song even though it is around 7.18 seven minutes and 18 seconds long but great<BR>9.The hardest button to button(10/10) Love it <BR>10.

I like meg's singing in this part.  I read on another site that it is about Meg and Jack Loving each other bit that is not true it is about Holly Golightly liking Jack and Meg giving her advice
B00005M91K|5.0|The film defies categorization.  I find it hard to put into words the emotions that this film evokes from me and others I have shared it with.  The images captured and arranged in the manner applied to Baraka must be experienced to be understood.  I recommend this film to any and everyone.
6305909326|3.0|This movie was suppose to lead Dean on an advanture (and ours in a way) in the search for the Ninth Gate that in a sense failed in its attempts. First off, I wonder who is that girl (played by Polanski's significant other) suppose to portray and why is she helping Dean, played by Johnny Depp admirably, and not Boris Balkin, the person who hired him to search and enthenticate the Ninth Gate book. I think she suppose to be Satan itself, watching over him if not one of his agent (like a guardian angel's). It seems to be the case since Dean has broken some of the deadly sin's in his ruthless pride for himself only and his lack of care for others. Satan does the choosing but it was ab odd way of showing that in the movie, like why go thru the motions, like why can't she just tell him the missing pieces. And what's with Satan having sex with Dean near the end have anything to do with the Ninth Gate????  Was Dean suppose to give Satan's (multi gendered i persume) a demon child? If so, what does that have anything to do with this movie. This seem to fit another demonic type movie that i saw before but it doesn't fit here...sorry.  Beside, if her face expression during the sex scene is suppose to put fear into our eyes, it could of did a better job since that wasn't even the same person at any point of the face change. If it had, then it might of been more believable but i was left to think 'who is this person DEan is having sex with?'. Well i was let down and maybe some of you feel the same way. This is not a horror movie and it wasn't suppose to be one but was attended to be a pychological thriller and in that, it acheive it in a slow pace way that only Polanki could. There is no doubt that Polanski can direct movies with his wonderful camera angles at making the viewer feel like they are there as well. The ending was a disapointment because it doesn't make sense yet i enjoy the movie nevertheless. <br />If you want to see Polanski's at his best, then read my review on 'Rosemary's Baby', which is one of the best horror movies ever made along with the Exocist, in my opinion. A classic tour de force!
6304602944|4.0|This fun action-comedy starring Sly Stallone and Kurt Russell is action-packed and occasionally very funny. There are two top cops called Tango (Stallone) and Cash (Russell) who get framed for a murder and now seek revenge on the crime boss that set them up (Jack Palance). There's plenty of action and great moments, but unfortunately there are loads of huge plot holes and ridiculous moments. This brings the film down a lot. Especially the final 30 minutes, which has Tango and Cash invading the crime lord's secret lair. Stallone and Russell are great in the movie and very funny. There are plenty of great moments with these two cocky characters. Overall, \\"Tango and Cash\\" is enjoyable, but there are better buddy-cop movies out there.
B00006RCPM|5.0|What can i say about this movie that you have not read or know already. This can happen in our future and the world would be a safer place for me and you. I'm going to watch it again.. Recommended Highly. <br />Watch it and enjoy!!!
B00000IMTE|5.0|This guy's guiar playing has influenced so many young guitar players out there now, that a statue of him in gold somwhere is long overdue! I've been a Deep Purple nut for so many years, and although albums like, In Rock and Burn, have some of his most amazing playing in them, this 1st Rainbow release is his best guitar work in the sense of melody. His playing on Catch The Rainbow and Temple of The King is just beyond words. I love Jimmy Page, Hendrix, Malmsteen, etc., but this guy invented a guiar sound that no one can match. No one was doing the stuff he was back in 1972 even, when Machine Head came out. You also have Ronnie James Dio delivering some killer vocals on this, what more could you want? 10 STAR BLACKMORE RATING FROM SCRAGGY'S TOMB OF POWER METAL, USA. (ANY MALMSTEEN FANS SHOULD HEAR THE INTERVIEW DISC ON HIS RELEASE, INSPIRATION, TO HEAR HIM CONFIRM WHAT I'VE JUST REVIEWED.)
B000001BX0|4.0|With its live-sounding performances, irreverent attitudes..., and kick-...rock, \\"Donde Jugaran\\" finds the rock spirit which sadly gets lost sometimes.  Most of the disc is in Spanish, but there's enough English to figure out what most of the songs are about, and if you can understand Mexican curse words, you've got about 80% of the lyrical content.  Fun album, starting with the album cover.
B00005JLK1|5.0|Well I watched this film on the pure fact that my friend threatened death if i did not go with him. Anyway the film starts out looking very 50's looking and we were just kinda looking at each other thinking \\"what the ****\\" then all hell breaks looses and the rest is history. We came out feeling truly entertained and would recommend it to anyone.
B000002H72|5.0|Doolittle is the perfect combination of Black Francis' misanthropic attitude, compelling songwriting, and pure rock playing.  The songs are direct, mostly brutal, but played without a wrong note.  The great songs (Here Comes Your Man, Debaser, Wave of Mutilation, No 13 Baby, Hey) more than offset the weaker ones (There Goes My Gun, I Bleed, Silver).  The emotion in Black Francis' voice and in the Pixies' playing on Hey and No 13 Baby show they found a new way to play the blues.  They plugged a cord right into their souls and that's what came out of the amplifiers.
B00008H2LB|5.0|As well as its title &quot;Meteora&quot; its music sounds so much powerful and fresh. Linkin Park's second studio album deserves much better than what critics are saying. Chester's voice sounds much more developed and tuned than ever, giving a great balance to the album among hard songs such as Don't Stay, Hit the Floor or Faint; and mellow songs such as Easier to Run, Breaking the Habit or Numb. Also the innovation on the background sounds given by Mr. Hahn are just astonishing. Personally, Meteora is on the run for &quot;best album (bought by me) of the year&quot;. My personal favorites are:<BR>-5th PLACE: Don't Stay<BR>-4th PLACE: Numb<BR>-3rd PLACE: Faint<BR>-2nd PLACE: Somewhere I Belong<BR>-1st PLACE: Lying from you
B000002H8F|3.0|Following up Doolittle, Bossanova sounds like the Pixies were trying to smooth their sound out and get a big hit (that's just my impression, I have no idea).  However, the Pixies sound is best rawer and louder.  The songs of Bossanova are pretty good, and the album is good to listen to.  If you have the other Pixies albums, I recommend getting Bossanova.
B000000ORX|4.0|is one of the finest songs I've ever heard. &quot;Tomorrow is Sunday, now there's only one day left till you go by, below my window&quot; I can't help but think of Leonardo DaVinci's &quot;window&quot; he also utilized in his paintings, his theories of depth and distance on the perspective grid show up in this new generational poet's work, wiht and in her words she weaves the same theories and philosophies with.<br />&quot;No one knows I'm here, One day I just disappeared, And took I these two grey rooms up here, with a view, only when you walk by, below my window, when you walk by...&quot;
0688163173|5.0|Admittedly, I am not an avid reader of mystery or intrigue books. With mysteries, I have tried many of the authors those fans tend to enjoy, but have always stuggled making that necessary \\"leap of faith\\" needed at some point. So, other than the occasional John Dunning or Hillerman book, the longest I've been able to stay \\"intrigued\\" by one of these books has been somewhere through the half way point. That said, not since early Grisham have I been so enthralled with a book as I have been with Shutter Island by Dennis Lehane. In spite of the tremendous attention Mystic River received, I never picked it up. With the tremendous writing exhibited in Shutter Island, I am reconsidering picking up everything I can get my hands on by Lehane.<br />Lehane starts working his psychology on the reader from the beginning as he isolates the two marshalls, Teddy Daniels and Chuck Aule on an island which bears the book's name. The premise, early on, is to find one of the patients/prisoners who has escaped.<br />They are required to give up their firearms only pages later, something that would have me saying in a theater, \\"Don't do it!\\"<br />Page after page is filled with their own baggage, personally and after combat, code breaking, psychology and all its evolutions, trust in a time of distrust, and on and on.<br />If you are looking for a page turner and to read a book from Lehane who has taken the torch from the likes of Grisham and Crichton, pick up Shutter Island.
B0000029DD|5.0|A friend of mines once said that an album's not truly a masterpiece if it doesn't \\"make you laugh, cry, have multiple orgasms, make you think, scare you, challenge you, and lastly...move you\\". <BR>Without, any doubt, one of those albums, if not THE album that fits that description is Jeff Buckley's \\"Grace\\". <br />\\"Grace\\" is atypical. A unique movement. Jeff was like a passionate author. Not building songs on ideas. But putting life and passion into them. The songs are characters. It's obvious that Jeff really, really cared about his songs. This album is Jeff's only completed set and although, he died at 30 in 1997, it shows that he had more to say than acts with 15 albums to their credits. <BR>The best songwriter of the 1990s, Jeff's lyrics enthralled, soothed, or even puzzled you. Not since Laura Nyro has such an enigmatic, passionate singer/songwriter emerged. The music on \\"Grace\\" is very eclectic. From Led Zeppelin metallic crunch to breezy torch to deep soul to art school fracture, it's all covered and all felt. This wasn't an attempt to show off his eclectism that even many well-intended singer/songwriters fall into. <br />Every song is a moving passage that's both haunting and uplifting. Very mysterious. \\"The Last Goodbye\\" has a emotive bass line and a beautiful chorus that reeks of lust and hope. The only radio hit from \\"Grace\\", matter of fact. \\"Hallejuah\\" finds Jeff taking a Leonard Cohen standard and making his own testament. He makes it an original composition. \\"So Real\\" is arty but still has that sulking vulnerability. \\"Eternal Life\\" and \\"Mojo Pin\\" feature his legendary sweet, soulful falsetto equal parts Billie Holliday and Robert Plant. But the Anti-Racism ode \\"Eternal Life\\"'s hard rocking merge comes off authentic. A track that fit the grunge era that it was released in but remains timeless. <br />Even when every track packs such relevance, the most thrilling moment on \\"Grace\\" is \\"Lover, You Should've Come Over\\". Beginning with an enigmatic organ solointo wails of passion and desire. It's a soul record with the soul. It's just too much. <br />\\"Grace\\" is the most erotic, soulful, dramatic, mysterious, cool, and admirable album of it's time. Epic yet still deceptively simple. One of the best albums ever. And a shining document of Jeff Buckley's immense talent.
B00000C28M|1.0|Every 10 seconds or so someone coughs. I understand now why the &quot;First Authorized Release&quot; is 36 years after it's first recorded.
079284131X|3.0|The scariest film with a doll is this 1988 thriller about a serial killer who transfered his soul in a doll called Chucky and when a boy discovers Chucky's a monster he starts bloody murders of mayhem to anyone mean to him.Director Tom Holland directs a cool horror film since his 1985 film Fright Night,this film has enough suspense and violence to scare viewers and at times throws comedic overtones in Chucky's wisecracks.
B000000OAH|5.0|This is rapidly becoming my favorite Queen album next to &quot;night at the opera&quot; the first 4 songs, &quot;Mustapha, Fat Bottomed Girls, Jealousy, and Bicycle Race&quot; are classic Queen. The rest are pretty good, but the Hiddden Gem in this album is &quot;Don't Stop me now&quot;.  you see, the first 30seconds are sorta bland WHICH makes you want to skip it, but after that... you get the greatest song sing &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot;<br />all in all, their best since &quot;Night at the opera&quot;
B00008DDXB|5.0|This film is much better than the first.  Columbus really captures the dark, evil shadow that lurks over Hogwarts this year.  Although Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's (Philosipher's [UK]) Stone was an excellent debut for the Harry Potter film series, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets really builds on the continuing plot between Harry and Voldemort.  In coming films, we will see Voldemort in many different appearances, including a frightful, babylike form in #IV. The Chamber of Secrets provides an excellent base for this kind of evil to come and the triumphs and lessons to be learned.  Bravo!
B000000OAA|5.0|This is the begging of classic queen, or it's American popularity started here. \\"Killer Queen, was there first american Hit, and is one of my favorites. \\"Tenement Funster\\" and \\"Flick of the Wrist\\" are also very good. \\"Stone Cold Crazy\\" is the best on this album, i think Metallica later redid it.<br />All in All, you should get this, it was what put them on the map.
B00005A0N5|5.0|in the nature of keeping all my reviews simple, i'm going to give you all that you need to know, nothing biased and unreasonable. this album, by far in my opinion, is their best album to date. this album, unlike Angels Fall First, got a five from me because it balances everything out. not too much melodic, dreamy, wonderland synths, and not too much heavy, quick, dark-metal music. just the right amount of everything to balance out 31 flavors of Nightwish. Sacrament of Wilderness will blow you away, all you have to do is get that song and that's it, you'll WANT the album. Sleeping Sun is the typical Tarja-melodic-angel-voice sing-sing song. it's a vry beautiful, deep, and poetic song. you'll understand it if you're a poetic type of thinker. over all, the album is crazy, genius at the least, at the most it's out of this world. Passion and the Opera is also another great song. this album mixes the right amount of everything to appeal to listeners to every realm whether you're dark and demonic, sad and gloomy, or Oceanborn.
6305252521|5.0|I was totaly blown away with this movie, i just saw it and now i am surprised at all the bad reviewes it is getting here. This movie is about a man who lives inside a fake world where everybody, everplace, and everything is fake. and about his getting wise and escaping. It is NOT a comedy, but does have funny parts and i would reccomend it to everybody who wants a good movie to watch.
B00008PW3Q|5.0|This is one of the best music I've heard in awhile.  What a great cd!... All 18 songs are very good.  The fact that Fleetwood Mac experimented with sounds is to be admire.  In this day and age of mediocre and safe music, is refreshing to listen to a band who won't give up in there artistic freedom just for money.<br />5 stars is just about right for this effort.  Congratulations to Lindsey, Stevie, Mick and John for an incredible effort.  Its nice to see this 50+ year olds caring to make the best music posible.<br />FLEETWOOD MAC ROCKS!...
B000000OAN|5.0|This is was and forever will be the Best album ever. I defy you to find a better one. \\"The Bohemian Rhapsody\\" was rated the Best Rock song ever in UK... and is the Best song ever.<br />All in all, if none else, this is the one to buy.
B00008PW3Q|5.0|I'll like to say this is one AWSOME cd. I like the fact that lindsey experimented with sounds and <BR>in my opinion did a great job doing it. Absolutely love all 18 songs of this cd.<br />For all the fans missing Christine, I only have one thing to say, GET OVER IT.  <BR>It was her decision to leave and I think Lindsey, Stevie, John and Mick did a great job. <br />The thing I like about this cd is that Fleetwood Mac experimented with sounds, <BR>not only on the lindsey's songs but Stevie's too. I mean, they could've make a \\"safe album\\" but they did not <BR>and I admire that. You got to be happy when a band of this caliber decides NOT to be<BR>\\"safe\\" and make such an incredible music.<br />In this day and age of mediocre and safe music, we should be celebrating that a band of <BR>50+ year olds can make the kind music fans deserve.
B000000OAL|5.0|This is truly one of my favorite Queen CD's I have all of them and though there is better, this is a close second or third. &quot;Keep your self alive&quot;, is very upbeet and is an echo of queen yet to come. &quot;Doing allright&quot; is my 2nd favorite and has a soft, slow beat. &quot;My fairy king&quot; is the best though, it has alot of &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot;ish ness to it.<br />all in all, one of the best.<BR>P.S. i am in the prosess of reviewing all the Queen Albums.(except greatest hits)
B00008PW3Q|5.0|Stevie is still in her prime and steals the show from Lindsey with her subtle and haunting songs that are always catchy and well liked.  While Lindsey's songs are great also, I still think that Stevie's sexy vocals are the best!  Christione McVie is missed and hopefully she will come back for future projects, but the rest of the gang picks up the slack.  This is an amazing album and I can't wait for the tour this summer.  The only thing I don't like is the packaging on the limited edition which is already showing wear and falling apart!  Here are my comments on each song:<br />1. What's the World Comming To- Catchy, old school fleetwood mac.  Reminds me of Monday Morning from the white album.<br />2. Murrow Turning Over his Grave- A little crazy and not your typical Fleetwood Mac!  Lindsey went insane and I wish he would save it for a solo album.<br />3. Illume- Haunting, great vocals by Stevie and a nice reflection on 9-11.  I love it when she sings, \\"I am a cliff dweller, from the old school.\\"<br />4. Thrown Down- Stevie proves she is the Queen of Rock and Roll!  Great lyrics, this song is stuck in my head!  I love it!!!<br />5. Miranda- Catchy, nice Fleetwood Mac song and Lindsey didn't go too insane.<br />6. Red Rover- Right back to the insanity!!!  This is a great song, but not a typical FM song.  Lindsey hit gold with this song and his craziness pays off but not everyone will enjoy this track.<br />7. Say you Will- The title track is from Stevie Nicks and is the first title track from Stevie.  Stevie obviously takes a few tips from Christine and wrote this sunny title track!  It is the best and it is so catchy.  I sure hope they put this out as a single because this has the potential to be a hit!<br />8. Peacekeeper- the first single from the disc.  It is nice and is already getting lots of airplay.<br />9. Come- Great song from Lindsey!  I love it and it is like I'm so Afraid and it really rocks!<br />10. Smile at you- Stevie, Great song!  I didn't know she could sing lke this.  Her voice sounds the way it did back in the 70's and is really nice.  I love how Lindsey's background vocals are evident.  It really makes them feel like a band!<br />11. Running through the Garden- My favorite song on the disc!  It is old school Stevie and it sounds like she is really rocking out on this song.  I love it and I think this could be my favorite song from Fleetwood Mac- ever!<br />12. Silver Girl- One of the weaker tracks from Stevie.  It is still good though...<br />13.  Steal Your Heart Away- Great song, slow song, almost like a balad.  Very soft rock and what we are used to as fans of FM.<br />14. Bleed to Love her- Instant classic.  From the Dance, and I love this track.  It is great!<br />15. Everybody finds out- Stevie and Lindsey's vocals are great together and I like this song but it is not as catchy as the other songs on the disc.  Still great rock!<br />16. Destiny Rules- Stevie is the best!  I love this song and it is one of those songs that gets stuck in your head.  I love it and I think this could get a lot of radio play.<br />17. Say Goodbye- I like this one from Lindsey.  It is a fast song, but striped down and it is almost like a song you could fall asleep with because it is so comforting!<br />18. Goodbye Baby- The weakest track from Stevie.  I don't like it yet, but hey, I only got the CD last week! <br />Get this CD now!  Run Don't walk!!!  And forget all those people who say the disc is too long.  I can only think of a few songs that could be taken off the disc and I can skip them if I want to!  Fleetwood Mac are still in their prime and are really great so I am warning you, don't pass this up!!!
B000000OAC|5.0|This is a very good one. almost all the songs are hard rock and all have replayability. if you don't know \\"We will Rock You\\" or \\"We are the Champions\\" you have eather never attended a sports event or are not american. \\"Sleeping on the Sidewalk\\" is surprisingly good. the only one I don't particularly LOVE is \\"Get down make love\\"<br />all in all, this album shows that Queen was really good at adapting to new music Genres, but still staying at the Top.
B00003CXUM|5.0|I found this film very beautifully done, the acting, music, and colour all came together to make a wonderful film that i will watch again and again.  I would recommend the above to anyone who enjoys a film of tragic love and that also stimulates the mind, heart, and keeps you engrossed to the very end.  Always an importent part of a film is the perfect soundtrack, and i will probably end up buying the soundtrack as well.

B00008PW3Q|5.0|First off, let everyone know it was CHRISTINE McVIE's decision to leave the band. She retired to be near her family in her homeland England after three decades of international superstardom. We fans, like the rest of the band, should respect her wishes. Christine's classic contributions to Fleetwood Mac were invaluable and incredible. She is missed, but HEY! - this is FLEETWOOD MAC and the band is still one hell of a creative and innovative unit moving on into the future with this brand new album. Whether this UNIQUE group of musicians records together or as solo artists, their complete productive output is always going to be: FLEETWOOD MAC. There is plenty to celebrate here - an 18 track treasure trove of fulfilling splendid rock and pop awaiting your exploration. The whole record grows on you with repeated listenings - if you pay close attention, you'll discover that this new album is quite similar to their groundbreaking productions from the mid-70s, it's CLASSIC MAC at it's finest and intriguing best. Lindsey cuts loose with some spectacular guitar work on several tracks, most notably on &quot;Come&quot; and &quot;Murrow Turning Over In His Grave&quot;, the latter which pays tribute to his &quot;World Turning-I'm So Afraid&quot; classic Mac era as he and the band chant along to the rhythm. Lindsey's magical pop songs fill the void left in the wake of Christine's departure. He's reworked &quot;Bleed To Love Her&quot;[previously on &quot;The Dance&quot;-1997)into a lovely aching lovesong drenched in classic Big Mac vocal harmonies. Stevie Nicks sounds quite the supremely reinspired rocker[Running Through The Garden/Everybody Finds Out]and her stylistic story telling balladeer gifts with which she's always captivated and haunted Big Mac audiences smolder and burn so brilliantly on her ballads here. Stevie Nicks sounds better than ever, and is as enchanting as only she can be. SAY YOU WILL reinstates FLEETWOOD MAC as the creative powerhouse band it became in the mid-70s, only now there's a rougher, ever melodic, harder driving edge here. FLEETWOOD MAC continues to please, reinvent, to fulfill our belief that no matter what musical landscape they travel down, we are deeply INTRIGUED...We fans and music lovers keep coming back to hear these unique vocalists, their captivating harmonies, and exceptional musicianship for another round of rare inspiring soulful rock and pop time and time again.
B000002H4C|4.0|Overall, this CD would've better if it had groups like Ozzy Osbourne, Iron Maiden, Van Halen, Saxon, Tygers of Pan Tang, Diamond Head and maybe Krokus but instead they have the classic rock groups like Nazareth, Stevie Nicks, Sammy Hagar, Journey and more but at least we have the metal tunes like Black Sabbath, Riggs and Trust (wonder what happened to those other two bands) and Cheap Trick has an awesome intro and outro from I Must Be Dreamin' and I also really liked Nazareth's Crazy (Suitable Case For Treatment) and of course the best song on this CD is the title track from Sammy Hagar and Don Felder.
0449227421|1.0|I hated this book so much that I ended up underlining (pencil) some portions of the library edition I read. These flat characters and unlikely scenarios served, I felt, as &quot;packaging&quot; to the author's ideological rants. Tacky, tacky, TACKY! No wonder the reviews I've read complain so often of the lack of depth. The author applied his energy to OTHER THINGS.<br />At least half of all people have no political leanings whatsoever (I'm in this half), they just live their lives, either behaving or not behaving. Of the other fifty percent, about one-half are probably actively conservative, so why harrangue and insult them? And without a pre-purchase warning that the novel is &quot;not for them?&quot; As a happy fence-sitter, I was not &quot;converted&quot; by what I read. It did not &quot;raise my consciousness,&quot; but rather the opposite. I was so annoyed, in fact, that I couldn't get into the book. I couldn't see or hear the characters, because the author would not shut up! That's a huge failure, and I resent the waste of my time.<br />I'd never read Ken Folett before. Of course I won't read him again.
B00005JLEU|5.0|Spirited Away is a beautifully drawn, anitimated, and plot out story about a young girl, Chihiro, who at the beginning is a tad bit whiny and spoiled. But as the movie progresses you see Chihiro, now named Sen, become more mature. It's a wonderful movie about, I believe, responsibility and love. I think Disney did a fine job dubbing it, as they have with the other movies by this same person. Grant you, I was disappointed in the ending, but if any of you remember Princess Mononoke it too had an ending like this. It leaves viewers to come up with their own idea as to what happened after the movie ended.
0151008116|5.0|Yann Martel's \\"Life of Pi\\" is the fascinating story of one Pi Patel, a castaway, stranded in the middle of the Pacific Ocean on a lifeboat...oh, and his only companion is a 450-pound Bengal tiger.  Thus is the stage for this genuinely unique novel.  Couched as a meditation on the nature of God and faith, the novel succeeds more as a straightforward, albeit unusual, story of survival.    Pi, the eponymous main character, is a boy of sixteen who despite being raised in the Hindu tradition of India (or rather around, his parents aren't particularly religious) has come to embrace both Christianity and Islam.  Moreover, his belief in one faith in no way detracts from his faith in the others; rather, he takes the core beliefs of each, and uses them to enhance his understanding of the others.  While this is certainly an unusual arrangement, it is perhaps not as shocking as Martel might have hoped, as the core beliefs of most religions are compassion, charity and faith in the divine.  On the other hand, if he was striving to highlight the absurdity of strife in God's name, he certainly makes a compelling point.    That said, the story, as I alluded to earlier, largely takes place on a lifeboat adrift in the Pacific.  Pi's family were zookeepers, and in the process of moving to Canada, the cargo ship transporting them and their animals sinks, leaving Pi and a tiger by the name of Richard Parker as the only survivors.  What follows are nine months of desperation, filled with small triumphs and journeys to the depths of despair.  Richard Parker is too big and dangerous for Pi to attempt to kill him, so he must find a way to come to an accommodation with this dangerous beast.  To do so, he is forced to call upon all of his experience as a zookeeper's son, while struggling to keep himself alive.    I'm sure that many will find this brief overview of the plot somewhat far-fetched; more of a metaphor than an actual story, I assure you that nothing could be further from the truth.Martel has taken a completely bizarre circumstance, and turned it into something not only believable, but also plausible.  \\"Life of Pi\\" is loaded with events that would be mundane if it weren't for the desperate nature in which they took place, and Pi's struggle for supremacy with the tiger is so pragmatic and deadly serious, any element of the fantastic goes right out the window.    However, as I alluded to earlier, the meditation on religion that Martel was striving for seems to fall short.  There are elements that echo parts of the Bible: a struggle with an unknown stranger (Jacob wrestling God/an angel), blindness and despair (numerous times in the New Testament), and Richard Parker certainly seems to fill an Archangel's duel role of protector and scourge of God.  Moreover, it wouldn't surprise me to find that there are elements from other religions that I an not familiar with.  All that aside, though, Martel never has Pi come to a true crisis of faith, a turning point in which only his faith in God can carry him through.  While Pi has many low moments, his faith in God never seems to waver, and he never calls out in his hour of need.    Of course, this does leave one alternative: that Pi is a modern retelling of the story of Job.  Pi as a pious man (or boy in this instance) who is tormented by God for the sole purpose of testing his faith.  Of course, this doesn't fit in with the traditions that Pi has embraced; the God of the new testament is compassionate, and I am unaware of comparable traditions in Islam or Hinduism (although that doesn't mean they aren't there, I am by no means a religious scholar).  Ultimately, I think Martel is arguing that it is our quiet faith, our steadfast belief in something greater than ourselves, which carries us through in times of trial.  If that was his goal, he succeeded admirably.    Ultimately, these meditations on religions can be treated as completely secondary.  \\"Life of Pi\\" is written with superb pacing, excellent narration and brilliantly conceived characters.  Moreover, the premise is so unique as to be completely different from anything you have encountered before.  Should the reader decide to look deeper, there is plenty to ponder, but it is completely enjoyable if approached solely as an adventure story.  In the end \\"Life of Pi\\" is completely deserving of the praise it has received, and well worth reading.    Jake Mohlman
B00006F83Y|3.0|This album has several great tracks, several okay tracks, and several mediocre ones, which in my mind adds up to a &quot;pretty good&quot; album.  The great tracks, like &quot;Hangin' Tree&quot;, &quot;First It Giveth&quot;, &quot;The Sky is Fallin'&quot;, &quot;Mosquito Song&quot;, and &quot;No One Knows&quot; more than make up for filler songs like &quot;Six Shooter&quot; and &quot;A Song For the Dead&quot;, while some songs proved to be just decent, like &quot;God is in the Radio&quot; and &quot;Go With the Flow&quot;.  Nowhere near perfect, this album is still good and I do not regret buying it.
0385006896|5.0|First of all, dont pay any attention to the people who say the book is made cheaply because it isnt. I have been reading Holmes on and off for over a year. This book has been all over America and traveled hundreds of miles but it still looks like new. Secondly, The Complete Sherlock Holmes is the best mystery novel available. You will never find a better mystery than those in this book. Holmes is the begining of all mystery liturature, and its best to start at the begining, right?
0385504209|3.0|Sorry to run counter to the rest of the reviews to date, but I've read better.  The endorsements from \\"today's hot writers\\" should have been a dead give-away - only average books need that kind of hype (see also, for instance, James Siegel's \\"Derailed\\" - a disturbing, voyeuristic book with little to commend it but the \\"hot\\" endorsements found on the dust jacket).<br />First, mechanics.  The novel's structure is okay.  Plot is fairly predictable, character development adequate.  Plot resolution, to my mind, is a cop-out.  I guess the ending is meant to be satisfying on some sort of metaphysical level, but I didn't like it either emotionally or structurally.  So Mr. Brown, just what exactly is the Grail?  What happens to the descendants of Jesus and Mary M., the Priory, etc.?  Can it be that the \\"royal\\" Sophie will take a commoner for her mate...?<br />As to the \\"Grail,\\" there's nothing new here.  We've heard all of this before (which Brown dutifully, but obliquely, states up front in the opening \\"fact\\").  In presentation I wish Brown had been a bit more subtle and less heavy-handed.  So much in-your-face lessons on symbology that I thought I had died and gone to Joseph Campbell heaven.  And if I read just one more reference to the \\"sacred feminine,\\" I was going to go on-line, buy all of Marion Zimmer Bradley's \\"Avalon\\" series from Amazon.com and OD.<br />Radical anti-Church feminists, Gnostics, conspiracy theorists - feel free to rejoice.  You'll probably find this book a worthy addition to your library of \\"anti\\" polemics.  Christians will do well to remember Romans Chapter 1 when they find themselves getting all riled up.<br />As a novel and as a work of theology, I can't think of a better way to describe the book than to state \\"See Ecclesiastes 1:9.\\"  I should have borrowed the book from the library or waited for it to come out in paperback.
B000089RVX|5.0|Okay people! What is with the Christianity thing?? Who cares what they are! They are not a Christian band but they have Christian members! It's music for crying out loud! You either like the sound or you don't. Evanescence is great and their religion has nothing to do with it. Amy's voice is amazing. Also, Ben has really nice guitar riffs going on. The music is a little hard but it sounds really good with Amy's voice, which is softer.  The lyrics are what got me into this band in the first place. They each tell a story and though some think their music is all about death, it isn't. Sometimes people just don't see the light in these lyrics. Listen to the lyrics and I'm almost sure you'll understand.
B000002TQB|3.0|I guess I don't see the big deal with this album.  I'm a Blur fan yes, but I don't find this album satisfying.  Some of the songs (London Loves, Magic America) are so ridiculous sounding that it makes the great songs (This Is A Low) hard to take seriously/enjoy.  Parklife's predecesor 'The Great Escape' is a better and more satisfying album.  I'm glad they've gotten away from this kind of quirkiness in recent days.  Hope the new one is good.
B00003CXB2|5.0|On a brisk February afternoon, I happened to be flipping through the channels when a mystifying landscape of a sun-baked desert caught my eye. Normally I had never given movies, which were older than I was by twenty or more years, a minutes worth of my time. On that day, I learned that I had been depriving myself of some of the greatest movies that had ever been made. Lawrence of Arabia, my now favorite movie, opened my eyes to the greatness of cinematic epics. For the rest of that February day, me eyes lay transfixed to the screen. <br />A few days later, I ordered the Special Edition DVD of Lawrence of Arabia and eagerly awaited its arrival. When I finally received it, I watched the movie from beginning to end. The cinematography of the movie is astounding. From the haunting beauty of the desert, to the British offices in Cairo, I felt as though I were traveling along with Lawrence. Peter O'Toole magnificently plays Lawrence with a passion and complexity now rarely seen in today's actors. Omar Shariff and Alec Guinness also do a superb job in their individual roles. The subtlety of the scene transition allows the movie to flow through the various stages of Lawrence's travels, and the bold musical score by Maurice Jarre blends harmoniously with Lawrence's complex personality. I vigorously recommend this movie to anyone looking for an excellent movie based on a fascinating man. Hopefully, someone else will discover and enjoy it as I have.
B000066C87|3.0|Altman's trademark is the interweaving of plot and dialogue, laying the various levels over one another. It works well where the dialogue can be understood, but in this Upstairs/Downstairs film the strong English accents, especially downstairs, make it difficult to understand much of what is being said. That, of course, is the way it is in real life (&quot;What did she say?&quot;), but it's an irritant in a film.<br />As other reviewers have pointed out, very little actually happens in this film; those expecting action should look elsewhere. It is a period piece along the lines of Masterpiece Theater, but with far better photography and more intelligent conversation. As is often the case with Altman, some elements seem contrived (the presence of the Hollywood director), which detracts from the otherwise fine performance of the actors involved.
0385507755|5.0|Yesterday was a beautiful day.  A new Spring day that should have been spent outdoors.  With every intention of enjoying a book with my morning coffee and then heading out into the sunlight, I picked up A Million Little Pieces and at 1:30 this morning, still in my pajamas from the night before, I put the book down. Finished. <br />James Frey's style, though unconventional, was masterful in its ability to draw me in and render me completely helpless to stop reading.  At times I found myself reading at a pace that was uncomfortable. Too fast.  My heart was racing. And then I'd pause and realize that I was feeling exactly how James must have felt and exactly how he intended me to feel.  <br />The period of addiction is honest and horrifying.  It broke my heart and made me sick to my stomach. The recovery is equally unpleasant. But despite the horrible things that James admitted doing while he was using, fundamentally he seems to be a person with tremendous love who can forge very strong relationships with other people but has no idea how to love himself.  Because of this trait, you want to like him in spite of his flaws.<br />In his book, James does not ask for our forgiveness or understanding.  He doesn't seem to need it.  He does not blame others for his failures, he does not pinpoint some event in his past that made him what he became and he does not ask anyone to feel sorry for him.  He simply tells an honest story, and he does it wonderfully.<br />You must read this book (but be sure you don't have anything else to do that day).

B00008PW3Q|1.0|The only point of this recording is to illustrate how vital Christine McVie is to the group.  Stevie Nicks' voice is annoying.  And there is not a decent song here.  Nothing comes close to their best work.  One hates to say bad things about a song dedicated to Mayor Giuliani, the NY Fire and Police Departments, and the victims of the September 11 terror attack, but Illume 9-11 is the least memorable song I have heard about September 11.  The repeating of the same lyrics over and over  is simply annoying.  Unless you are a Fleetwood Mac completist, this is a must to avoid.  Giving this one star is overly generous.
1577311523|5.0|Tolle's words bridge the gap between reality and illusion by explaining that it's the \\"now\\" which forms the basis of our spiritual self. Excellent read. And if you're in the mood for another thought-provoking book, then I'd recommend I Wish I Never Told My Father I Didn't Like Cheesecake, by Simon Waters, M.D. Incredible tale of love and inspiration.

B000067G3C|3.0|SWAT officer Jack Traven (Keanu Reeves) must face off against a mad bomber (Dennis Hopper) who has rigged a city bus to explode if its speed falls below 50 mph.  When this film was first released, I was as caught up in the action as anyone and easily forgot the absurdity of the plot.  Upon a recent reviewing, however, I found that it just didn't hold up for me.  I couldn't overlook how silly the basic concept is, and the stereotyped characters and dialogue grated on my nerves.  Nevertheless, director Jan DeBont deserves credit for taking this idea farther than anyone else could have./
B00008PW3Q|3.0|I have been a fan before Stevie &amp; Lindsey, but became an even bigger one after they joined. With that said, I must say I am dissappointed in the way the album turned out. I do not know what Lindsey was doing. I would think from his material that he was trying to make it as bad as possible. Lindsey should have stayed away and continued his solo career, Oh wait, he didn't have one.<BR>Someone please get Christine back. Her and Stevie sound great together. This album is filled with great Stevie songs, but have been tarnished a bit by LB's producing. Stevie's Trouble in Shangri-La was 100 times better than this new album. I think FM should SAY GOODBYE to Lindsey and see what Vito and Burnette are up to these days. Then maybe Christine would be willing to at least record with the band again, even if she doesn't want to tour. Stevie definitely kept this album from sinking.<BR>Stevie should release an alternate version of SMILE AT YOU, one that Lindsey hasn't touched. I have heard an earlier version that was a demo and it was great! It was powerful and was all Stevie, what happened to that version? <br />Oh, 3 stars with LB and 4 stars without him.
B000002LBH|5.0|In the spring of 1987, one year following the group's masterpiece \\"The Queen Is Dead,\\" the Smiths released two albums.  In the UK, they unleashed \\"The World Won't Listen.\\" But in the United States, they released \\"Louder Than Bombs,\\" a double album of singles, b-sides, and rare tracks.  A compilation of this nature shouldn't work, but, amazingly, it did. \\"Louder Than Bombs\\" shows why singer Morrissey and guitarist Johnny Marr weren't just simply leaders in mope rock--they were also among the most vital and influential British songwriters of the 1980s.  Morrissey exposes his utter contempt for pop music in the semi-controversial \\"Panic,\\" croons though the brilliant and self-loathing \\"Unlovable;\\" shines through the potent \\"Rubber Ring,\\" and is even funny in the snide \\"You Just Haven't Earned it Yet, Baby.\\"  But the heart of the album, I think, is the still-marvelous \\"Hand In Glove,\\" the band's debut single replete with Johnny Marr's stellar guitars.  But the songs I just mentioned only hint at the many riches this album has to offer.  At 24 tracks, \\"Louder Than Bombs\\" is a huge platter of material, but the songs here are brisk and range from very good to brilliant.  I played this to death when I first bought it, and it still gets the occasional spin in my stereo.  A great album that earns its five stars.
B00003CXA6|5.0|This movie is to me, an inspiration to all the people of the world.  This movie puts us right there on the battlefield with great men such as Robert E. Lee, Winfield S. Hancock, James Longstreet, etc.  The Pickett's Charge sequence itself is worth the price of the movie.  It makes us look to our past, and follow the examples of the our past leaders.  This is my favorite movie of all time.  Even though, it is 4.5 hours, it is well worth it.  Sitting there watching it, you get sucked into the time period.  You can't stop watching it.  Because of this movie, the world will never forget what thousands of men did the first 3 days of July 1863.
0446310786|5.0|This book tells the story of the Old South. Its a tale of racial hate and those that stand against it.At least in this little town in mississippi. And, also of some of the scary storys children make up to explain that which they do not understand. It is also a story that helped me go back, in my mind, to when I was a child and some of the things I did and thought at that time. I find this to be one of the most enjoyable reads ever. Its written plainly and its very easy to follow. The character development is also very clear...Just a wonderful book overall.

B0000584V3|2.0|As of late, I have heard quite a lot of praise for Opeth. I've heard that they have artististic value and originality that many of the anti-god, gore-obsessed death metal bands neglect. Generally, bands like Deicide, Cannibal Corpse, Mortician, and the like base their acts on disturbing/ojectionable (yet indecipherably grunted) lyrics, all the while playing palm-muted guitar chords and blastbeats*. Strength is no doubt involved, unfortunetely, due to lack of ideas, these bands often proceed to play 'songs' that usually sound the same. Additionally, some of these bands try to convert their fans into [insert death metal band name, aforementioned or to your knowledge] 'purists' in order to remain popular in the underground.<br />*note that Napalm Death often writes politial and introspective lyrics for their songs. However, their music (refered to as 'grindcore') prevents any arguement that it is different from other bands in the same vein.<br />Opeth has been around since the late 1980's, when grindcore and death metal started to gather fans or cult followings. Prior to their debut \\"Orchid\\", I believe they were more of a hard rock band with a much different line-up. After awhile, they basically developed a sound that was a mixture of the pioneer death-metal band Death, the epic song structure of 70's progressive bands like Pink Floyd and Yes, and more melodic pieces of symphony. They released several albums prior to Blackwater Park, and they eventually became quite popular with their Sweedish music fans.<BR> <BR>Although they suceeded in winning a modest American fan-base with the 1999 release of \\"Still Life\\", Blackwater Park is without a doubt their most successful breakthrough with the American mainstream. Critically accalaimed for it's supossed beauty and aggression, it was a hit. This was undoubtably a groundbreaking release. Prog fans rejoiced, and many of the people who thought of death-metal as only noise quickly changed their position and got into other bandsof the type (In Flames and the disbanded \\"At The Gates\\"). <br />Although I do applaud their work reviving the more accesssable and complex recipricle of the noisy death-metal genre, this is unfortunetely a below-average release by my standards. It's true that it has an interesting style of switching back and forth from harsh and heavy sound barriers to soothing melody and acoustic guitars, but due to it's repetition, it fails miserably. With little variation, Blackwater Park is a repetitive and musically boring album. Michkael (Sp?) is a good singer, no doubt, but like all death metal vocals, the growl gets old incredibly fast. The guitarists use the same riffs throughout, and don't seem to have incredible skill. Not to mention, they have to switch to acoustic too much. I have no problem with melody as it stands, but it just gets really dull when it is repeated over and over. The good part is that the guitars tend to have very complex time-shifts (see \\"The Leper Afimity\\"), and that wins them some points.<br />The rest of the band seems to know what they're doing. A lot of the other musical elements to the album appear to have a dark age feel. The songs are longish (none shorter than 6 minutes excluding a brief interlude), and often meander. The lyrics are the artistic typical fanfare, you can read them in the booklet. <br />Despite my low rating, there are more good songs than bad. \\"Bleak\\" has some brutally emotional vocals in the middle. \\"The Drapery Falls\\" has an amazing guitar line in the beginning and outro. \\"Dirge For November\\" is an ideal idea of a peaceful day, when a sudden wind storm blows everything away, and afterwards the people see what happened to their homes (you might understand if you hear it). Plus, \\"Harvest\\" is a cool acoustic song with amazing lyrics...<br />...but the cons of this album are too overt to ignore. 90 percent of the songs use the same heavy-to-soft-to-loud-to-sweet or whatever. \\"The Leper Afimity\\" starts good, but then just wandersinto nowhere. \\"Funeral Portrait\\" sounds rushed, and the final track \\"Blackwater Park\\" is 12 minutes of the death growl with absolutely no purpose but to make a long song. The last line is cool though.<br />I am not a huge fan of death metal, and I think that melodic death metal is an oxymoronic concept (death metal usually is not supposed to have soft parts). Why bring the two together? I will give Opeth another chance though (\\"My Arms, Your Hearse\\" actually sounds pretty good from what I have heard), but their earlier work has even more of the same meandering and nonsense, only in a different fashion as this.<br />If you like Tool, Pink Floyd or Rush, you may like this. If you never liked traditional death metal, this may win you. However, if you are a traditional death-metal fan (fan of Mortician or Deicide) and cannot appreciate anything softer than usual, this is not for you. The same applies to any who prefer simplfied nu-metal bands like Korn or Limp Bizkit.

On Rain Dogs(which bridges the gap between other classics such as Swordfishtrombones and my personal favorite Bone Machine)the listener is propelled into a whirlwind of junkyard accesories, found objects, the pulse of dark streets and thier affairs with lonely alleys and the cries of its desperate characters. It reaks of the muse in drunken visions and provides hallucanagenic insight into the ever evolving soundtracks of our unconscience.<BR>Not many people can make a hubcap, a tin cup and a railroad rail function  as an accompaniment to ironically beautiful lyrics sung by the king of all gut buckets;Tom Waits. Unfortunatly Tom Waits and Roland Kirk never collaborated but if they had I imagine some of it might have sounded like this album. <BR> This album will always accompany your wildest dreams lingering at the bottom of a whiskey bottle and that is a great thing.

This album came out during in the heyday and popularity of Satanic occultism, demon worship, and the like- founding its way into other genres as well as comic books, movies, and a variety of published books for mass market distribution during in those days. <br />Although non-Satanists themselves (like we're told), Slayer's not that totally ignorant about the kind of songs that they are purveying, in which where they have become as one of the pioneering acts in the cultic genre in Rock music that has come to be known as Death Metal Thrash - vocalist Tom Araya thus stated in response to those who question them in what they are doing, that they don't 'condone' such things they speak of, but rather they are portraying them so as to make it clear to the masses that \\"such things happen\\" in the world where we live in.<br />Having listened to the most of the releases in their catalog - i could now confidently say that the band is quite really monotonous in their delivery (dime-a-dozen example of this matter is that both \\"Angel of Death\\" and \\"Jesus Saves\\" had a point of totally having the same chord and exact structure in particular with this album) and have only began to try emulating a different approach to their sound by their follow up to this one called South of Heaven, which is a notch above their sophomore album Hell Awaits! and carries the band's cover of the Judas Priest(es)'s\\"Dissident Agressor\\" (however the low peak of the said album is that: although the band may have tried to 'improvise' on their music, Araya's vocals have turned almost quite nearly into as a squeeming peep-squeek sad to say); and (perhaps forced for a marketable need to compete more in the present recording bussiness' mold ?) such a change is now so evident on their latest release God Hates Us All  - which may i add is very impressive in its production.   <br />There was a time when i have a very great appetite for these kind of music such as Slayer's (PANTERA's Vulgar Display of Power is a great successive stuff to this). ...<br />END NOTE: This \\"Expanded Edition\\" includes two bonus tracks: the remix version for \\"Criminally Insane\\", and their very first recording \\"Agressive Perfector\\" which originallly appeared on them classic compilations METAL MASACRE 3.<br />Rate: 2 1/2 stars<br />* these lyrics are heard played forwards  =P
B000000W8C|5.0|The Verve is one of the greatest bands in the world, having been able to weild atmospheric and spacy tunes with soul-searing vocals. However, their third album is a stark change from the charged atmospherics of their first two albums. Compared to their other work, this album is very mellow and dark but pulls it off with swagger (This Is Music, A New Decade), an epic scope (History) and downright creepy instrumentation (Stormy Clouds). Listening to these songs produces imagery of rain, abandoned buildings and desolation, but in the end, it manages to paint a powerful portrait of a darkness. However, the album's true power comes in the fact that The Verve synthesized its atmospheres from its first album and the lyrical power from A Northern Soul and created the masterpiece Urban Hymns. An interesting transistion for one of the most interesting bands in the world.
B000002J1I|5.0|Like among Christians - along with other things there are those who are only in it for such reasons like money and are not true to the reason and motives of why they are in the faith; thus, so it is similarly the same with Yes fans- there are those who are only attracted by the hype emulated within the band's presentations rather than the music itself (which is applicable to many other bands and other genres than only music as well); and still, there are those who are Yes fans solely because of the group's grand type of music. If you belong to the latter category, it is much too likely that you can't escape appreciating this non-commercially successful albulm of YES. Not really on the veins of an experimental project - YES' ninth studio release is a collection of nine brilliantly captivating songs. Really this is not a put-on I'm telling you. The album boasts of some very brilliant materials, that have unfortunately only suffered some dry production setbacks due to schedule delays, caused by frictions and arguments within the band- which in the end-result, Rick Wakeman left the band for the second time; and this time around, lead man Jon Anderson also left the group, resulting to the number of his solo projects and a number of skits with former APHRODITE'S CHILD (comprised with famed greek singer Demis Roussos) Vangelis, before Anderson (of course I'm not talking about Jethro Tull) got back with the band again (this time with South African rock heartthrob Trevor Rabin on vocals and guits - which spawned the 80's Yes type of music); and in turn, this departure of Wakeman and Anderson after this album's release also brought forth YES' (only(?) effort without Anderson) lp called DRAMA(1980), which featured The Buggles'(\\"Video Killed The Radio Star\\") Trevor Horn handling the trying-to-sound-like-Jon-Anderson lead vocal chores, whilst at the same time with Geoff Downes on keyboards - as the follow up to this hugely under-rated album Tormato two years after.<br />Obviously, amidst the heartbreaking beauty on the number of tracks in this album, the sounds are at times lacking some filling of landscape - such as Wakeman's orchestral arrangements for \\"Madrigal\\" and on Squire's four minute religious ballad epic \\"Onward\\" which are left unfinished (and is taken over by Andrew Pryce Jackman as outlined in the album's credits). <br />Tormato being one among those rock LP's that are released bearing the ideal of an 'album concept' record, also suffered in its artwork, perhaps caused by a hurried production for the album's packaging - mainly with the Tor concept spearheaded (matter-o'-factly) by Jon Anderson, which is depicted on the album's innersleeve and disc artwork - and is probably what the pseudo-lame track \\"Arriving UFO\\" is getting at. Speaking of that track - sure it may be cheesy, (mainly the intro along with how the first stanza lines are sang by Chris Squire and Jon Anderson), but still it had the depths of some remarkable moments and dizzying heights courtesy of Steve Howe's rollicking fretwork amidst the combined backdrop of Wakeman's firey keyboard licks and Squire's soaring bass lines (you should check it out). The album's opener \\"Future Times\\" which immediately loops to \\"Rejoice\\" is a buoyant combination which is really uplifting to the spirit, while the track \\"Release Release\\" featured a tremendous roll of drum solo from their long-time (ex-PLASTIC ONO BAND)drummer Alan White. The album's final track in the album \\"On The Silent Wings Of Freedom\\" is an excellent one that nearly levels with Led Zep's equally brilliant closer to their fourth untitled album \\"When The Levee Breaks\\". And don't miss the carnival-like space ballad \\"Circus of Heaven\\".<BR>Furthermore, Yes' take on a little environmetalism \\"Don't Kill The Whale\\", all prior to the notoriety of the Aussie group- the fabulous Midnight Oil, is not that bad either. <br />All in all - Tormato is one amazing album from Yes, and contrary to popular belief, it has more to offerthan its reputed blandness and is not really that much of a disasterpiece; as a matter of fact in spite of all the misfortunes during it's production - the album's materials stood for themselves to survive the mishaps. <br />If there ever were indeed a disastrous album from the group - then it would have to be no other than their 1973 2disc LP set TALES FROM THE TOPOGRAPHIC OCEAN. <BR> <br />Rate: 9 notches out of Ten = *********
B000002AP1|5.0|Let me preface this by saying I'm not a musician, so I can't speak as a musical authority. But, like a noted jurist once said, \\"I can't define pornography, but I know it when I see it.\\" I'm not a rock musician, but I know great rock music when I hear it. \\"Raw Power\\" was, and is, one of the greatest rock albums of all time. I first heard this album in the mid-70's and, 30 some-odd years later, when rock music has become more conformist and non-threatening than its ever been, more safe and corporate, \\"Raw Power\\" stands as a malevolent oasis in an arid, puerile desert of self-indulgent waste. I love Iggy, but I've always thought the Stooges as a whole got short shrift in comparison. The guitar-playing of James Williamson is as blistering as it comes, past and present, and, thanks to Iggy's re-mix, the talent of the Asheton brothers is given the showcase it has always deserved. There's a place, I suppose, for the Bruce's and the Bon Jovi's, but the Stooges are still, all these years later, the group you won't ever hear on the radio (although I believe a fragment of one of their earliest songs is being used in a beer commercial). Is the music still as nihilistic and misogynistic and atavistic as has been stated by much more eloquent critcs than I? Probably. But, 30 some-odd years and numerous imitators later, I'd still put it up against anything else out there.
B000069HJI|4.0|This albulm quite resemble a very dark atmosphere indeed. The last SUPERTRAMP lp to ever have Roger Hodgson before he'd gone out from the band to pursue his solo venture, (thus what is perhaps symbolically denoted by the vinyl disc's artwork where a scissor is used to cut a rope as with the album cover, including the inner sleeve where the band members are depicted as balancing themselves walking on thin lines) -it carries Hodgson's last and final hit single with the band \\"It's Raining Again\\", along with his seemingly autobiographical \\"C'est Le Von\\"* - which sort of serves as his swansong with the group (and for me is one of the best songs ever written by Hodgson, and one of my all-time favourite songs by SUPERTRAMP) that seems to echo the ongoing friction with his collaborator within the band- Rick Davies, who appears to counter the latter song himself with his own written track \\"Waiting So Long\\".<BR> As for his other contributions in Famous Last Words, Davies' role plays to sing some playful tunes, being both he and Hodgson coming down to the point of turning into a corroborative stance to sing their own works (kinda lot like what turned out for the tandem of Lennon/McCartney during the Beatles' final years), but still wasn't spared from the gloomy feel that this album has; that apart from the situation going on within the band during in the time of its recording - it may have been given all likely too well due to the combined production work of Pete Henderson and the concert sound provided by Russell Pope.<BR> Perhaps stricken with an after-movie daze, Rick Davies' \\"Bonnie\\" written in the perspective of 'Clyde' (well not exactly- just kinda) apparently could've come cheesy, but it turned out fine, and it's quite an alright tune too. However, Hodgson's \\"Don't Leave Me Now\\" serving as the closer to the album, is perhaps one of their most passable tracks. <BR> From it's opening song \\"Crazy\\" (which (pardon me for saying so) sounded quite a bit like a post-disco Abbasong (sic)), the tracks in this album never differ that far from carrying the gloomy lyrics (mainly Hodgson's) which the band have bannered from their previous albums such as CRIME OF THE CENTURY (w/c have the 'space-rock' schtick \\"Dreamer\\") and EVEN IN THE QUIETEST MOMMENT (w/c contains their hit \\"Give A Little Bit\\" along with its impressive title track, plus the 'epic' rock-opera \\"Fool's Overture\\"). <br /> On the disc's insert, the 9 songs' printed lyrics are colour-coded: Davies' songs (totalling four tracks) are printed yellow, while Hodgson's (a total of five songs) are on white.<br />Although some have disagreed that the album had an 'ironic' title because after this album's release, Rick Davies went on carrying the name SUPERTRAMP without co-founding member Roger Hodgson (and much later on without the other band members as well (a lot like what Tony Iommi similarly did with BLACK SABBATH)) and though not up to the full level of the Beatles' LET IT BE -being the last of what we could have from SUPERTRAMP's classic line-up of Hodgson, Davies, John Helliwell, Dougie Thomson, and Bob Siebenberg - FAMOUS LAST WORDS, in a way, have indeed quite have lived up to its title.<br />Rate: 7 out of 10<br />*HEART's front women twins Ann and Nancy Wilson appeared here as backup-vocal guests, (along with Davies' \\"Put On Your Old Brown Shoes\\" - w/c gives us a peep of how he would sound like dominating the band years later).
0670824399|5.0|MATILDA by Roald Dahl<br /><br />Roald Dahl never ceases to amaze me.  I adore his diversity along with his sweet way of making his fans and readers sincerely care what happens with his many characters: i.e. \\"Charlie Bucket\\", \\"Sophie\\" and now our heroine, MATILDA!<br />Matilda is probably Dahl's finest creations.  She is not only a sweetie but quite the genius with a heart to match.  Dahl has been accused of hating children, due to his stories that involve many shenanigans that revolve around children and a their demise.  Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, The Witches, and even Matilda.  All these stories center around adults despising children.<br />Matilda Wormwood is a little girl that is neglected and treated badly by her asinine parents because of her intelligence.  She has taught herself how to read and even finds her own way to the library.  Matilda's passion is overwhelming when it comes to books.  Matilda develops telekinetic powers and uses them in the most ingenious, resourceful and cute ways.  Especially on her mean old Principal, Miss Trunchbull.<br />However, her teacher, Miss Honey is a soft spoken, sweet as honey teacher who loves being around children and teaching with bright colors, cute little ditty's, and dances.  Matilda's dysfunctional life at home is ludicrous and certainly shows Dahl's grim outlook of children but drives out some of the best stories ever written.  By the time Matilda enters school, the little darling has read the old classics from Jules Vern and Charles Dickens.  Matilda is a very well-rounded and cultured little girl, who dwells in the most horrible of circumstances and living conditions.  She is truly a hero by every sense of the word: HERO.  She will warm your heart and keep you smiling as you turn the pages.<br />The book is beautiful as the words inside.  A must have for Dahl fans or readers that just enjoy a delightful reading excursion into another world, a world of Dahl.
B000002J20|1.0|I hereby hold in my hand the 2vinyl LP set of Yes' 4-sides/4-song album (one song each side), which have been and still is a source of arguments within fellow YES fanatics and rock enthusiasts alike.<br />Not that I'm taking sides - TALES FROM THE TOPOGRAPHIC OCEAN is indeed a quite disast'rous album from the band. Most of the conceptual musical pieces are reportedly lost within the band members during the excruciating eight-month period production of this ridiculous album.<br />Serving as the follow up to their three-tracked LP Close to the Edge (which is absolutely an epic itself I should say by the way) - this double LP as overseered by head man Jon Anderson, is based from the four-part 'Shastric Scriptures' of  Paramhansa Yoganada's AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF A YOGI (bear-ing(sic) it thus as Anderson's supposedly neat (and albeit silly) concept for this album), that along with the ever eclectic guitarist Steve Howe, he provided for the words within the four very-long songs contained herein, amidst the music that the band have struggled to come up with for this 1973 effort of Yes.<br />This album's cause to deride itself into ruin is that it have gotten much too big, that in the end-result it have been overblown to the point that the band members, namely Jon Anderson himself, could no longer handle its pieces until it overwhelmed to fall apart in the process. Wakeman's supposed highlight track (as according to the lp's liner notes of  (who else?) Mr. Jon Anderson) 'The Second Movement' (ie. titled \\"The Remembering: High The Memory\\")  &lt;trk. #2 on the cd/ LP 1: side 2 on the vinyl album> is one of the worst stuff that could be ever heard of from the band, languishing in a whole lot of pointless lengthiness for twenty minutes or so (as most of the titles' length in this album are), that it have well dragged enough for Rick Wakeman to leave the band for the first time (the second being after the release of the TORMATO album), who admittedly is bitterly critical for what direction the band had by this album's conceptualization.<br />However though, 'TALES...' still have a fine moment presented in its fourth final trk. ('The Fourth Movement' so to speak) called \\"Ritual:Nous Sommes Du Soleil\\", which the band could perform in full glory on its entirety of 21:35 length in minutes during their tours' gigs back in those hackneyed days of the classic Yes era in the 70's.<br />If you were just a casual fan of YES, it wouldn't be much of a loss to skip this one, but if you're a YES completist like me - go for it.<br />The album also features the artwork by regular YES album graphic artist Roger Dean.<br />Rate: 3 notches out of 10 (1 ½ out of five) = ***(*******)tion the band had by this album's conceptualization. <br />However though, 'TALES...' still have a fine moment presented in its fourth final trk.

B00005K3OT|4.0|A Mary Poppin's theme (or the Parcival enters the Grail Castle and does/says the right things to releave the inhabitants of their inauthentic - living death - lives.). This movie, however, is for the self-made outcastes, hypocrital dregs, self-sorrowing martyrs, nearly lost drug adicts, punks, Rebel W/O a Cause sorts etc. of the past (two?) generations - who have made despising life an art - to change their minds and join the living in some sort of human (humane) form. It even has the appealing (to these people) Johnny Depp (a pretty good actor). But it is, none-the-less, Mary Poppins. However, with a twist - she stays.

B000089RVX|5.0|very good CD. never really liked female singers but this one blew me away. such a contrast in songs but she pulls them together well. excellent CD
B000068IEU|1.0|This movie and the other 'I spit on your grave' are [junk.] very exploitive to women. Movies like these make rape look like a male sport pastime and alot of these reviewers, men especially, seem to enjoy it. This movie is sick and degrading, not to mention the horrible acting and stupid characters. Does anyone notice that the girl who is killed by the lake continues to move and breathe after she is supposedly dead????? Talk about low budget filth.
B000089A07|2.0|Okay, lets get this straight. This movie is not only based upon a novel, its also a remake of another movie. Hey, lets not forget its a sequel as well. Hold on a minute, its also a prequel. Wow, what other movie could boast such an interesting history? The only problem this movie has is that it stinks like the dead bobies stuffed in Buffalo Bills' backyard.<br />Maybe that was a little unfair. This film does deliver gothic and eery thrills from the beginning, a stellar A-list cast that at least does its best with the tired material on offer and Brett Ratners' direction is strong. Its just that it has an air of 'been there, done that' about it, which ultimately undoes any obvious effort that has been made by the filmmakers to try and create something mildly entertaining.<br />The story concerns a world weary FBI serial killer expert Will Graham (a miscast Edward Norton), who has taken early retirement after successfully tracking down cannibal killer Hannibal Lector. He is coaxed back onto the job by the appearance of new nutjob on the block, cheekily nicknamed 'The Tooth Fairy'. The film flicks back and forth between part crime/police thriller to gothic horror, and sits uneasily as a straight genre picture. The problems with this film are legion, as compared with Michael Manns' original movie 'Manhunter' which was always stylish, scary and demanding. Maybe I am too much of a fan of that movie to appreciate this incarnation, but this one is pretty boring to watch, whereas Manns' film is a juggernaut of fast cutting, cool cinematography and excellent acting from the cast. Compare Edward Nortons' wimpish and dull portayal of Graham to William Petersons' angst ridden and determined expert, who could easily slide into the dark side of his persona at any minute. At around an hour into the 'Red Dragon', I just wanted Norton to stop the investigation, pack up his bags, head back to his wife and maybe get his foppish hair cut. Not exactly the kind of guy I needed to be rooting for. And as for Ralph Fiennes as Dollarhyde? Okay, he was pretty good - actually the best thing about this movie. His 'relationship' with Reba McClane (an always good Emily Watson) is sincere and creepy, but after the powerhouse performance of Tom Noonan as Dollarhyde in the original and his freaky interaction with Joan Allen as Reba, this comes off as good effort, but not good enough. Oh, did I mention the poster boy himself? Yeah, Hannibal Lector is given a more substantial role this time, but as usual Anthony Hopkins (one of the best brit actors around) hams up this role within an inch of its life. Where choice lines like 'I have oodles of time' would have had audiences crawling the walls in 'The Silence of the Lambs', this time they only irritate and annoy. It seems that producer Dino De Laurentiis is trying to create a $100 million dollar Freddy Krueger for todays' teen-obsessed market audience.<br />Ted Tallys' screenplay is predestrian at best, failing to inject any new or interesting lifts into the script and one wishes he would have finished his association with Lector at 'Silence'. As I said before, 'Rush Hour' helmer Brett Ratners' direction is solid, if uninspired, and one wishes he could have bought that energy he has displayed on his previous efforts with him. The production design is suitably over the top, with creepy gothic houses and the cinematography is laced with 'Seven'- lite flourishes and nods to the original 'Silence of the Lambs'.<br />So then, a dull big budget mechanical exercise made with the only intention to make a lot of money for studio execs. Steer clear, and get Anchor Bays' 'Manhunter' special edition to see how this book should be filmed.

Most people look at Free Bird and just assume it is good, but it is not good, it is great.  &quot;I Ain't the One&quot; is a great rocker, &quot;Tuesday's Gone&quot; is a great bluesy type tune.  Gimme Three Steps&quot; everyone has heard this one. &quot;Simple Man&quot; is the best song on the album.  &quot;Things Goin' On&quot;  is one of the best singalong songs ever, great lyrics.  &quot;Mississippi Kid&quot; is also great, for God's sake it has a mandolin in it.  &quot;Poison Whiskey&quot;  is the second best track on the whole CD.  &quot;Free Bird&quot; well, it's Free Bird. The most requested song in FM radio history.  Sell your dog to buy this.
1857026691|5.0|For all the mathematical colleagues, this book has a minimum amount of notation, maybe little more than you can find in Treasure Island. It is a nice readable book, though, if you read it curled up on your couch with a cup of tea at hand, and nothing on mind.<br />If you are not a math or science major, you would ask me: why should I read this book? I would answer: because math appeals to a large number of people, and, you got to admit it, in this period of time people must know something about it. This theorem, in addition, had puzzled great mathematicians (even geniuses) for more than three and a half centuries. I think this means that it had passed around so many mathematical schools and fields.<br />The book starts with some exploration of Greek mathematics, being the base of modern thinking. Here we must see something about the Pythagorean Theorem, because it inspired the Fermat's Last theorem. The author speaks about a nice incident about a Pythagorean being killed for believing that there existed some numbers other than the Rationals (They were called Irrarionals later, even though they are as rational to the modern mathematics as any other numbers, say the quaternions).<br />He moves then to speak about Fermat, the French mathematician. He mentions that Fermat did not in fact write a proof for his theorem due to the limitation of the margins of his copy of Diaphintine's \\"Arithmetica,\\"! this caused the whole mathematical community to suffer 385 years to construct a plausible proof.<br />After that, we see how Euler proved the case when n = 3. Then Sophie Germain prove it, inspired by Euler, for the Germain prime numbers (which are some special prime numbers). This eliminated most of the cases, yet there still are infinitely many cases to check. The book does not go into technicalities, but you can enjoy reading about the backgrounds of some of brightest mathematicians of the 19th century.<br />Then comes some account on cryptography, as being the direct application of Number Theory, followed by the story of how Andrew Wiles, the most famous mathematician of our time, came to prove this theorem.<br />It proved to be even a harder task. It involved some modern up-to-date mathematics ... some fields of Number Theory called: \\"Elleptic Curves\\" and \\"Modular Forms.\\"<br />Finally, I would like to say that I read this book when I was at my junior year in the department of mathematics at the University of Missouri-Columbia, I DID NOT NEED MUCH MATH TO UNDERSTAND IT. It, as a matter of fact, inspired me to continue my grad studies in the subject of Number Theory; unfortunately my real mathematical interests won the quarrel and I had to settle with Geometry.<br />I think any person with some understanding of the notion of mathematics may be very able to enjoy it as much as I did. If you want an introduction to this \\"mysterious\\" discipline, this book would provide you the best read.
B000001ESN|5.0|This is Rush's last awesome album. The album after this, Moving Pictures, was such a downer that I stopped listening to them. I didn't even know they were still around these days. This is the last album where Mr. Lifeson has that, what we all called, that Hemisphere Growl, with the 355. If you go to a party or gathering, Take PW with you. Nobody in attendance will be disappointed. This is Rush's best.
B000002C25|5.0|There's been a weird about-turn by many magazines over this album. Q magazine gave it 5 stars only to, shamefully, later disown it. Oasis themselves see it as an unfortunate by-product of too much of the party lifestyle and never play any of its songs live. The truth is that Oasis have become more middle of the road since this album was released. D'you know what I mean? is the closest Oasis have ever got to  the Stone Roses 'Breaking into Heaven' and Fade In-Out, too, hints at The Roses' saldy maligned Second Coming. It still ranks as their most ambitious album and you can't help smiling at the Beatle-esque meanderings of All Around The World as it loops on, ad finitum. It's a very British madness, this album, like Pink Floyd- indeed the Floydian helicopters enter on the first song. My Big Mouth, I Hope, I think, I know and It's getting better (man) seem to be cut from the same cloth and a belief in the future and Magic Pie stumbles heroically to Stand by me. Girl in the Dirty Shirt has the magical quality of She's Electric. Not just a collection of singles glued together with some fillers, this feels like an album and should be listened to on a long sunny afternoon in the car.
B000001ESP|2.0|2 1/2 stars. I can't force myself to give this album 3 stars. But 2 is not enough. Permanent Waves was the last Great album by Rush. The Camera Eye is a rock n roller track. Glad to have seen them do it live many years ago. Limelight is also good. Vital Signs was, and still is, a testament to how terrible this band's music can be at times. YYZ is absolutely a great song, but horribly recorded. Try this: Listen to La Villa all the way through, and then listen to YYZ . You will see the sub-standard production of it. Moving Pictures is ok. I still listen to it, but not as much as their earlier stuff.
B000002C25|5.0|Well one day I was at a used book and cd store when I saw this cd on the shelf, I was looking for something new, I've been listening to a lot of Led Zeppelin, Nirvana, things like that lately, thought I would see how the newer stuff is, and I have heard a couple of the songs on this cd elsewhere and thought they were good so I picked it up..I was surprised to find that I actually enjoyed it, who knew that an impulse buy would turn out to be great?? lol<br />I would reccomend this cd if you're looking for something a little different than the usual I guess...like someone else said, it might take a while to get into the feel of the song, like Magic Pie sounded pretty dumb atfirst but now it's one of my favorites, lol who knew right...so yeah.....good cd, glad i got it:)

0385504209|5.0|While the story is about a hunt for the grail, this book may be the Holy Grail ! It starts fast and hooks you right away. The story has many twists and turns as the heros take a fast trip in France and England. This intelligent mystery will keep you guessing (wrong) all the way through. One of the best books I have ever read and highly recommended.
0800177177|4.0|More Francis Ford Coppola's than Bram Stoker's, this \\"Dracula\\" near-faithfully adapts the novel but adds a superfluous romance between the Count and Mina Murray - probably to give the material an emotional pitch to match Coppola's baroque staging.  Many have interpreted this version as being \\"about\\" HIV, but with its dazzling array of cinematic tricks and deliberate intertextual references I think it's more about the history of cinema (and the startling parallels between vampirism and the rituals of Catholicism).  The performances are thoroughly indulgent, and rightly so.  Hopkins and Oldman positively revel as Van Helsing and Dracula.  Restraint might be the basis of style, but not here: the players are the perfect match for the otherworldly production design, ludicrous costumes, lush lighting, and Wojciech Kilar's wonderfully evocative score.  The result is a kind of Romantic excess which will have you either swooning or smirking - probably a bit of both.  Either way, it's great fun.

0312305060|5.0|THE HOURS by Michael Cunningham<br />After I struggled through MRS. DALLOWAY by Virginia Woolf, I decided to tackle Michael Cunningham's THE HOURS.  Despite the fact that I did not enjoy MRS. DALLOWAY as much as I'd hoped to, I thoroughly enjoyed THE HOURS.  Michael Cunningham twists the original book by Woolf into a modern day version of the same, but he adds the story of Virginia Woolf herself, writing the original book MRS. DALLOWAY.  By changing the original characters slightly, and using a different series of crises, he creates an original story that totally threw me at the end of the book.<br />I am not going to go into the details, but wanted to comment that while reading the book I first found it only ordinary, and did not understand why it won the Pulitzer in the first place.  By the end of the novel, I clearly understood why it was such a brilliant piece of writing.  I highly recommend this book, but with a warning: please be patient and do not criticize too highly the fact that he took an original classic and twisted it around.
B00008J2DQ|5.0|This is definately the best work Godsmack has done. The CD is heavier than the other two albums, and there is a lot more melody which is a great addition to the songs.

B00005JLK1|5.0|This movie has a lot of gore in it but thats not all it has going for it the director obviously put a lot of thought into the storyline.  We are introduced to this idea that a cruise ship in the 1950's just disappeared and noone ever found it.  Now in present day the ship is found adrift by a pilot.  A salvage crew goes out in order to pull the ship in and make a lot of money off it.  What they don't realize is that the ship has some plans of it's own for them.  This story has an excellent twist to it and when you hear the little girl ghost say &quot;let me show you something&quot; you had better sit back and enjoy the ride.  An excellent movie overall it also has some awesome extra features on the DVD, be sure to check them out.
1567184855|5.0|Dr Michael Newton has produced a book which has been life changing for me and for many others to whom I have recommended this book.  <br />When beginning a search for spiritual information some years ago, I was led to this book, which was the first book to really make sense of life after life.  The concept of reincarnation and the experiences of learning both during and between incarnations unfolds superbly through the narrative of sessions with Dr Newton's clients.  For students of life's meaning, Dr Newton provides a clear understanding of our purpose and the wonders that we have experienced between lives and can look forward to experiencing again after death in this life.  A great read, fabulous information and a book which makes genuine sense of why we are here
B000002JSN|5.0|I've never heard In My Time of Dying played loud enough. It's a song to go deaf by. The rest of the album is almost as good and some of it's even better.
0385507755|5.0|I am an avid reader and this is the first time I have ever felt compelled to write a review. This book is hopeful, disturbing, thought provoking and absolutely impossible to put down. Mr. Frey finds a way to give the thought process behind addiction  and recovery without sensationalizing the process.  When I bought A MILLION LITTLE PIECES I never thought I would come away from it feeling inspired,which is exactly what I did.  could not put this book down and have recommended it to 10 friends who all loved it  or are in the process of loving it.

B000000W3G|5.0|The Smashing pumpkins are a respected band. The pumpkins are mainly known by their double album Mellon Collie and the Infinite Saddness,which brings us the box set Aero plane flies high. As a long time Pumpkin fan, I love all their stuff. I have their cd's, their dvd's, and their video tapes, but I didn't have the box set and it really hurt my collection. when i got the set it made my Pumpkins collection complete in my opinion. I love it and to any one out there who is a pumpkins fan and doesn't have the set needs it and they will find out it makes the collection more worthy and more lovable . I love my pumpkins cd collection. Every thing of the pumpkins I buy.
B000003TAW|5.0|This is an excellent album. I picked this up last year, and I was blown away. It starts off very strong with \\"My Name Is Jonas\\" and keeps it going, despite the changes in tempo and attitude. The songs are very well written. Rivers Cuomo, the band's guitarist, lead vocalist, and songwriter, is able to tell a cognitive story about himself while allowing you to identify with him as if the song was about you, one of the few people who has been able to convey this to me, at least(sorry, Metallica fans, but their songs are just random garbage about evil to make a quick buck: they were never deep and meaningful).  He also does a great job vocally, sounding good, yet emotional. The rest of the band also does great, especially Patrick Wilson's drumming, which not only keeps the rhythm, but even takes away from air guitar by making you air drum. Matt Sharp's  bass sounds great and carries the entire final track, \\"Only In Dreams\\". And Brian Bell earns extra bonus points for being the only rock star I know of from my home town in addition to being a great guitarist. All in all, An amazing album that will appeal to you regardless of mood. (P.s., the guy that wrote the Amazon review messed up a couple of things. Undone is about the end of a tour, according to Rivers Cuomo, and the Big Bopper died with Buddy Holly, not the Big Dipper.)
0441003257|5.0|I've let over 10 of my friends borrow this book over the last nine years, and have had to re-buy about 5 copies to be able to hold onto a copy of my own.  It's simply one of the funniest, most moving, most exciting, most re-readable books ever.<br />Put simply: Try and find another book that as deftly ponders the meaning of being human, having free will, and what choices we are told to make in our moral lives day after day and can still make you laugh so hard milk comes out your nose.
B00005JKZT|5.0|Lord of the Rings, the Two Towers, is one of the best cinema experiences I had in years, and proves to be more than a worthy sequel to the Fellowship, and this is coming from someone who has never read Tolkein, and no idea about the story and the sometimes confusing characters and names.<BR>Nevertheless, it was mind boggling experience, a feast to my senses..Over three hours passed by as mere minutes, and by the end,I wanted more!<BR>I think the biggest surprise of the Lord of the Rings franchise is the director Peter Jackson, <BR>a New Zealander with a CV and style that can be best described as a cross between a funnier Cronenberg and a more subdued Waters, with films like Bad Taste, The Frighteners and heavenly Creatures, and suddenly he unleashes on the world the best movie trilogy since Star Wars in the late 70s.<BR>I don't know whether the films would have come out the same with another director, but with Jackson he proves to be one of the most talented directors in the business today.<BR>To be able to handle Tolkein is no easy task, yet to be able to film all the trilogy back to back with such technical,visual and scriptual command, is the result of undeniable strong talent.<BR>Another aspect about the first two Lord of the Ring films, is the scenery! It is simply breathtaking. The New Zealand Tourist board is undoubtedly eternally grateful to Jackon to have provided them the best advertisement they can ever wish for. But the scenery is not merely a background series of postcards, it is rather an integral part of the film, and not since films like Deliverance or Black Robe, did the scenery play an important role in the story telling.<BR>The final aspect I want to talk about is the end scene, The final battle.<BR>With my over twenty years of avid movie watching, I can safely say that it is by far the best battle scene ever filmed!<BR>It is mind boggling, using a combination of extras and digital trickery. <BR>I can not wait for the third installement The Returnof the King, and although i am going to be the first to buy The Fellowship when it is released on DVD, I too know that eventually the whole trilogy will be released as one package with so many extras, making it an essential buy of what is one of the best movie experiences of all time.
0385507755|5.0|This story was overwhelming.  The initial 150 pages grab your attention with the honest rememberance of James' initial pain and suffering in his quest to become sober.  The strength of this individual is only equal to the sincerety of his story.  The remainder of the book is a total quest for friendship and truth.  <BR>The book is a MUST READ - A million little pieces is one complete piece of masterful reading.
B00005JM1Y|4.0|When James Bond thought it is safe again to save the world, in comes another spy spoof with a difference, it stars Rowan Atkinson..<BR>While the Canadian Anglophile Mike Myers did it so well with Austin Powers, adding a lot of surreal touches, Rowan Atkinson is the real deal, creating a spy that has inherited a lot from the characters that has made his name over the years, Mr Bean with his muscle and face twitchings and helplessness, and Blackadder with his nasty but harmless remarks, especially against the French.<BR>There are also elements of Inspector Clouseau too, Johnny English is too a loner who happens to be responsible for a big case just by incredible turn of events.A 'idiot' who happens by sheer good luck to solve the case against all the odds, with an annoyed superior and a faithful deputy who saves the day.<BR>Although there are brilliant comedy moments in the film esp in the sushi restaurant, and some well timed slapstick which seems a rarity in comedy films these days, the script is somehow uneven in places,but it all works out fine at the end.<BR>John Malkovich plays yet again another 'psycho' but as good an actor as he is, he always delivers flawlessly, while the gorgeous Nathalie Imbruglia returns to acting after a break for a successful music career and is quite good as English's side kick.<BR>Peter Howitt,the ex TV star of the sitcom Bread turned director (he has to his name Sliding Doors and Anti Trust),proves to have made a good career move.<BR>In short,Johnny English is a funny movie, is Rowan Atkinson's movie, tailored for his abilities and talent, one that will leave you with a genuine smile or two.
B00005JLEU|5.0|ONCE IN A LIFETIME AWESOME MASTERPIECE.
B00005JLEU|5.0|note: This is a new 2012 review of this film<br /><br />Hayao Miyazaki's SPIRITED AWAY is the best film of 2002!!! I picked it as my choice for that ten years ago, and it has not changed. I saw other films that were released that year, including the Oscar winner (CHICAGO), and another critic's top pick: MINORITY REPORT. (That movie is on my Ten Best list as well.) But neither of these films had the powerful effect for me as this amazing animated film. And if I were to meet that critic and say that SPIRITED AWAY was the best film of 2002 he wouldn't question it for a second. (He loved that movie, too.) If you know who I'm talking about, you're most likely right.<br /><br />There is a simple reason for my pick: No other film captured my imagination, astonished me with such incredible images, and hit me on an emotional level as this movie. Now add the statistics for SPIRITED AWAY: It is the most popular movie of all time in Japan (over $200 million before it ever came to the U.S.), the first animated film to win the Golden Bear award for Best Picture at the Berlin Film Festival, and the only Japanese animated film to win the Academy Award for Best Animated feature. Miyazaki has done one hell of an achievement. This film was the second movie in a row I declared Best Picture from Miyazaki. The previous film was PRINCESS MONONOKE in 1999. That one is a wonderful film that got me really interested in Japanese Anime.<br /><br />The story is clearly inspired by the classic, ALICE IN WONDERLAND. But it is only loosely inspired because every single frame you see is 100% Miyazaki. A moody young girl named Chihiro (Daveigh Chase) is moving with her parents (Michael Chicklis and Lauren Holly) to a new house. The father makes a wrong turn and they find themselves in front of a strange building with a dark tunnel. The father is curious what's on the other end and convinces Chihiro and the mother to walk through it. They emerge to a large field and what looks like to be an old amusement park. One thing leads to another and the parents undergo an unbelievable change. Chihiro finds herself trapped in this strange world. She meets an unusual boy named Haku (Jason Marsden), who tells her the only way she can rescue her parents is to obtain a job at a bathhouse, run by an evil witch named Yubaba (Suzanne Pleschette). The bathhouse is a place where spirits go for personal pleasure. Humans are definitely not welcomed here, but Yubaba reluctantly agrees to give her a job. Chihiro is warned that it will not be easy work, but she would not suffer the same fate as her parents.<br /><br />If it sounds like the witch is the villain in this story, and Chihiro is the hero, it is not that simple. Although it is true that the witch is evil and unkind, this isn't a tale of good against evil. Miyazaki had the best explanation: The bathhouse is part of the spirit world where good and evil exist side by side. Among the characters are Kamaji (David Ogden Stiers): a part human-like character, a black figure with a mask for a face, a blob of smelly goo who comes to the place for a bath, and a twin sister of Yubaba. I will not reveal who is good or bad; you have to see the movie for yourself. Chihiro discovers something that has always been inside her. She is the Arc of the story, as they always teach in writing class: the one who undergoes the most change. And unlike some other stories, it isn't handled in an obvious and contrived way. It is done with intelligence and a sense of subtlety. I ended up caring so much for this character. She is caught in a situation she did not deserve to get into.<br /><br />It didn't take long before I felt myself so emerged into this that it became that Out-of-the-Body-Experience that I so rarely have. I feel like I am in this movie along with the characters. It comes not from any big action scenes, but from emotion and images. No wonder. SPIRITED AWAY has just one amazing image after another. Long before I discovered Miyazaki I knewabout Japanese Anime. But I found a lot of it to have a rather jerky flow of movement. There is one scene where Chihiro walks through a huge flower garden, and everything is so incredibly smooth moving. This is also true in an early scene when Chihiro looks outside a car window. Miyazaki has always done his animation by hand. (Every single frame has passed through his personal drawing board.) Here, he uses digital technology for the movement and it actually adds to the effect instead of drawing attention to itself.<br /><br />So many Hollywood movies these days, even the so-called \\"family films\\" have all this non-stop action and fast cutting. But in SPIRITED AWAY, just like in PRINCESS MONONOKE and almost every other Miyazaki movie, there are scenes where everything goes quiet. A frame will actually remain still, or not cut to another frame for several seconds, and you will hear no music or dialogue. You can actually just look, listen to the silence, and drink the imagery that he has delivered. You can look at and spot something amazing in the corner that you would never expect. And the amazing detail that Miyazaki so painstakingly put in each frame becomes so incredibly clear. It is a joy just to look in the corner and see what he might have hidden there.<br /><br />When we do actually hear music in the film, it adds to the emotional power to the scenes. It was done by Miyazaki's longtime film composer: Joe Hisashi. Note that Miyazaki flawlessly combines this score with a lengthy scene involving Chihiro on a train. He doesn't cut corners by just showing the beginning and the end of the train ride, as a lesser director might do. He takes his own time, using so very little dialogue. The scene becomes more subtle and grabs your attention.<br /><br />If you've read my review of PRINCESS MONONOKE on Amazon.com you will remember how I really praised the ending and how it handles a romance. The hero doesn't so much get the girl. He just doesn't get the girl YET. But I finished it with the belief that a real romance would actually come out in time. Miyazaki ends SPIRITED AWAY almost exactly like that.  And as a result, the movie does another wonderful thing that is sadly uncommon for me. It made me think about what might have happened to these characters after the movie was over. And to add another icing on the cake the movie contains a powerful Japanese song heard over the end credits.<br /><br />What an amazing, beautiful, and powerful film. I hope that this review encourages you to seek out this movie on DVD. I'm still hoping for a Blu-Ray release in the future. Miyazaki claims the movie was for 10 year olds. There are some scenes that might be a little too scary for children younger than that. (For those children, I would strongly suggest MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO). But if you have ten year old children, and their attention spans haven't been corrupted by the so-called entertainment being shoved down their throats show them this movie. Disney released it in the theaters in 2002 and on DVD with a perfectly dubbed English soundtrack. Ten year old's may have been Miyazaki's target audience. However, it has grown way beyond that.<br /><br />I quoted Howard Hawks in my review of PRINCESS MONONOKE for his definition of a good movie: \\"Three great scenes, no bad scenes.\\" For SPIRITED AWAY, I would multiply that formula by five.
B00008PW3Q|5.0|Great to have Fleetwood Mac back! Yes we all miss Christine but<BR>make no mistake, this is FINE Fleetwood Mac, the trouble is that a lot of reviewers like to pop in a CD and then criticize. This is the kind of work that needs time to digest. After having a week to play the CD many times, and assess each song, I can honestly say that each and every song is has it's own merits. Every one will find some tracks they like more than others, and the CD is a little long for one sitting. But take a few songs at a time, and you will understand. Many people didn't like TUSK either, the first time around, and now everyone seems to think it's a lost masterpiece (they're right).  The same will come true of SAY YOU WILL.
B000002TYK|5.0|I bought this the day it came out, and knew it was something special. Every track is special, yet unique in sound, which is quite hard to do. It rocks fast, slow, hard, and soft, yet sounds astonishing. Dave Grohl played every instrument on this album, displaying his genius. This album still holds up after 8 years.
B00002Z88D|1.0|This album is without question, the most insulting and humiliating disgrace to Metallica ever known. I mean really... all the orchestra stuff extremely clashes with the greatest band in the world.. I mean Metallica is my favorite band,but I listened to this, and i couldnt believe it was finally over. I will NEVER listen to it again. During the complete process of listening, i was thinking like WOW HOW COOL it would ACTUALLY be if the horrible sound of that stuff in the background would like DISAPPEAR :-) !!! but if you want a cd with with some major clashing music this is perfect for you, and I seriously hope they're new one, St. Anger DOES NOT HAVE little extra background remixes, if ya know whati mean :-)If so,imean if this is in the future the new metallica, im divorcing them.
B00005JY1B|5.0|My favorite movie of ALL TIME!!!!  Charlize Theron is great in this movie along with Keanu Reeves.  There chemistry is incredible.  I feel bad about giving a review and not saying much but I don't want to spoil it.  It rocks!!!!  All I'm saying is, things happen for a reason.  There's a message behind all of this, well the movie, duh!  Can you figure it out?  Take care.  Please, Please, give it a chance.

0679731725|5.0|I love drama novels that make me think about my own lot in life.  This book makes you close it and say that is what I should not do I should act seize the day and not watch opportunities pass me by.  Worth the read.
0316666343|5.0|I fell in love with this book! I read the first one Alcie Seabold wrote, &quot;Lucky&quot;, so I figured I should read &quot;The Lovely Bones.&quot; I reccomend this book to everyone. From page one I couldnt stop reading it.
B00006LIRI|2.0|Ok, I love U2... I've grown up with them my whole life.  But I just can't love this CD.  Mysterious Ways and One are great songs, and so are Beautiful Day and Kill me..  I guess I'm most disappointed with the re-mixes of the songs from Pop.  I for one liked that album a lot.  The first half had some great songs on it, but the re-mixes are horrible.  They hit the head of the nail with the 80's, but missed this time around.  I'd still recommend the album though, its a good way to get a bunch of songs that were only done as singles on one disc.
B00000IPAX|5.0|Many people feel that Blink 182 has lossed it's hardcore punk style and have become your everyday sellout like Good Charlotte. While I do agree that All the Small Things was a major let down, I feel that the band has greatly matured. In an interview Tom Delogne stated that, \\"Our real fans know what we're all about. We write serious songs except for the occasional one about humping dogs but that's just for fun.\\"  Blink 182 has shown an increase in maturity with their new album Take Off Your Pants and Jacket. I haven't heard a single song on Take Off Your Pants and Jacket on the radio. Travis Barker has added a complete new sound to the band. That's because he is by far better than Scott Raynor. Travis also drums in a way that is quite impressive. His beats and fills are very fast and complex, and nearly impossible to play, but they go with the music in a way that sound more musical rather than a drum solo one might show off with. They have also learned to harmonize their songs so it sounds deeper and adds to the serious affect. For anyone that longs to hear music before enema of the state, this album isn't for you. For those of you that like the songs Anthem, Going away to College, and Adam's Song in particular, this album and Take Off Your Pants and Jacket are definitely for you.
B00000J7RZ|5.0|So I can't hide that I like pop music, it's fun and it's easy to listen to. This album didn't disappoint me, granted it's mostly filler and the singles are the best songs, but it's such a fun album, back in the time when Jennifer was only known as Jennifer and was acually pop! This album had her best song Waiting For Tonight and Jennifer actually seemed to be having fun, now it just seems to be all about collecting husbands and increasing her riches, it's sad really. But this album is a must!
0064471837|5.0|Garth Nix,described things very good! I only just read it but would reccomend it for kids 9 and up! It was great!
0743243153|5.0|You closed the book because you were appalled by one statement.<br />\\"Moreover, were I ever to have a case in which I concluded after careful and judicious consideration that my patient's spiritual growth would be substantially furthered by our having sexual relations, I would proceed to have them. \\" - page 175<br />Yet, if you can be more open minded and read on, he does mention that sexual relations with patients do not help the clients in anyway and that is why he chooses not to have any.<br />Just because the law claims it is criminal, that doesn't mean it is wrong. Looking back at the history of the law, like religion, it has been wrong and corrected many times.<br />You may be appalled because the thought of sexual relations with a client is appalling. That thought is just a thought and you have to understand where the thought stems from.<br />Scott Peck chooses not to have sexual relations with clients becuase it is not benefical in anyway for the client. That is the bottom line. He is willing to risk his job, challenge his morals and challenge the law to help his clients become better.<br />In my opinion, that is more courages than accepting thoughts that have no facts.<br />Also check out my web site ...
B000002KGT|4.0|After the success of Fleetwood Mac´s selftitled album they wen´t into the studio and began recording what would become one of the biggest selling LP´s in history. It took almost a year to finish the album and the sessions were tough as everything was falling a part in the band members personal life and everything was in turmoil. Most of the songs on the album were written about their struggels or how to live through them. Also they wrote about each other<br />Second hand News the firs track on the album. It was kind of song that was about him doing his thing or something. Overall a good track but not the best on the album. 7/10.<br />Dreams was a bit different then the rest of the songs because you did not know wether it was about someone or not ,yet the lyrics are brilliant and Stevie´s voice is wonderful. 9/10.<br />Never Going Back Again was a bit sad song that was just an acoustic guitar and Lindsey about heartbreak. 7/10.<br />Don´t Stop is a optimistic song about looking to the future and hoping it will be a lot brighter than the present and hope for a better day. A great pop track that Clinton used when he won the elections in 1992.  10/10.<br />Lindsey wrote Go your own way to stevie about their releationship and was not optimistic about wether it would going to work out. 9/10.<br />Songbird Christine is writing a very personal. 9/10.<br />The Chain was kind of different track the lyrics were written while Stevie And Lindsey were not in Fleetwood Mac and the song itself was the only song on the album were all band members wrote together the music. 8/10.<br />You Make Loving Fun which is one of the best songs on the album is about Christine´s boyfriend at the time. He worked in the studio and made Christine gain her confidence however John was there and her boyfriend was often not with her so she wrote the song. 9/10.<br />I Don´t Wan´t To Know was a duet with Stevie And Lindsey about love and how it often stinks ( I don´t know how is should put it).8/10.<br />Oh Daddy was a song about Mick who was the only father and the relationship he had with the kids. Christine wrote that because she felt it was important to Mick to have his children around at the time. 9/10.<br />In Gold Dust Woman Stevie is writing a song about cocain and how to deal with being addicted to the drug. Hole made a terrible cover of this song for the crow soundtrack. A great song. 10/10.<br />Fleetwood Mac´s rumours is indeed the mac´s important album and their best as well. I am not a huge fan´s of theirs but I´ve listened to few albums by them besides this one both in the beginning pre Buckingham/Nicks and after and I am going to say this is the best one and I am no fan of Stevie Nicks by any means and not by Lindsey Buckingham. I find their solo projects to be boring and to self-indulgient as well as sounding all the same and trying to be so innovative while they are just mess.

0441003257|5.0|This book is so amazing it is beyond words. I was laughing, I was crying (from the laughing), and I was completley consumed with the book from cover to cover. I have little to no knowledge of the Bible, getting what I know from resources other than the good book itself. I have to admit there were only a couple of times I had to ask my friends what certain religious things meant, but other than that the book was great at expressing each stage of Armagedon without confusing me. The book is simply hilarious, as I've allready said. The characters are amazing, of course I have my favorites but each one does such amazing job of pulling you into the story and helping you to imagine their own little world. My favorite pair, Crowley and Aziraphale working for their bosses from both hell and heaven respectfully, yet they don't want the world to end. They enjoy it to much. You even learn to love the antichrist in this book, Adam, and his 3 other companions, no matter how much mischief they cause. And, the hilarious trio of Witchfinder Sergeant Shadwell along with his new Private Newton Pulsifer and their interactions with Madame Tracy. Not to mention Sister Mary Loquacious the Satanic Nun of the Chattering Order of St. Beryl who make the whole story line pausible. The flow of the story is just so entertaining, and the wonderfully developed characters are the ones leading you on through the whole thing.
0385721234|4.0|The book &quot;Like Water for Chocolate&quot; is a great book. The book deals with a teen-age girl who wants to marry but can't because her family tradition won't allow her to. The tradition is that she is unable to marry because she is the youngest and will need to take care of her mother.<BR>I gave this book 4 out of 5 stars. The book gets kind of confusing but overall it is a good book that deals with love and desire.
B0000636UN|4.0|I've been a fan of Sheryl Crow's music since she first delivered &quot;Tuesday Night Music Club,&quot; and, though this isn't my favorite of her pieces, it's not at all bad. If you like what she's delivered before, this is essentially more of the same, though it feels more fun and less accomplished coming off the masterful &quot;Globe Sessions.&quot;<br />Crow's country influences, which she acknowledges in interviews and in concert, are on full display here. The title song, frankly, is a country song. It's got sorrow and loads of lyrics delivered with a twang. It's a terrific song, the kind you expect to be performed by someone really sad late one night in the middle of a bar. &quot;Soak Up the Sun,&quot; the catchy first single, is a good little summertime tune, but, if you pay attention to the lyrics, you realize that Crow's intentions are a bit deeper than that. She goes to great lengths to explain why it's necessary, once again, to have some fun. &quot;Safe and Sound,&quot; a slow ballad, is also terrific.<br />No song on this, though, is as good as her &quot;Mississippi&quot; from &quot;Globe Sessions&quot; or &quot;Strong Enough&quot; from &quot;Tuesday Night Music Club.&quot;
B00008H2LB|4.0|I have to say i was pretty impressed by meteora.  Linkin Park may be commercial, but they stood on what they were doing.  I must say that the instrumental disapointed me, and the rap too.  But the might be part of the game, and i have nothing to say about the rest of the album.  Well ... maybe one word ... awesome ... any real fan of LP would really like this album like i did ... but it is not mine to judge for you ...
B000071ZZI|3.0|<BR>Essentially, Matt Damon is an assasin with amnesia trying to piece together his life and avoid being killed by a cadre of CIA thugs.  Franka Potente (Run Lola Run) is the girl who hooks up with him (and stays with him for no apparent reason).<br />The movie has that edgy, Mission Impossible, euro-feel to it but is very short on explanation and plausibility (Assasins are out to get them at every turn so Damon cuts Potente's hair so they won't be recognized, and yet never so much as wears a cap to disguise himself).<br />Nothing in this movie (acting, chemistry, plot) rises above the routine.  It's as if everyone involved in the movie agreed to sleep-walk through it knowing that based on the name and the actors it would do okay.  And it is &quot;okay&quot; for a renter, but not much more than that.<br />If you want a &quot;Borne Identity&quot; knockoff, with a better hook, better acting, chemistry, action and story then see &quot;The Long Kiss Goodnight&quot; with Geena Davis.<BR><BR>
0345457684|4.0|Wow. I wasn't expecting it to be this good. Morgan had better keep writing! His character is durable; good for a series. The images are powerful and striking and the ideas are thought-provoking, which is what we want out of sci-fi. The concept of re-sleeving into body after body is deep; who are we, really? I'd say one flaw is too much preoccupation with torture (I skipped those parts), though it is consistent with the idea that [ending life] has become illegal. Lots of depth to other concepts: what do we become when we are rich enough to live for centuries? How would that distort our thought-processes? This novel was a page-turner. I want him to write more so I can turn some more pages.
B00008H2LB|5.0|Linkin Park has done it again! Great guitar riffs, amazing lyrics, nice beats and scratches. This album is simply incredible and fantastic. All the songs have so much depth into them that listening to it once ain't gonna cut it! Each of them are unique in their own way that I can't even choose a favorite. I listen to it everyday and I haven't gotten sick of it yet. It is constantly in my stereo. All the preparation that went into this has finally paid off. They went platinum within the first two weeks of its release. Meteora sounds even better live! Everyone should own a copy of this album!
0451527046|2.0|I didn't really come into the reading of Treasure Island with any expectations even though the tale and characters are iconic. Yes, I knew it involved buried treasure, pirates and Jim Hawkins but was ignorant of the specifics of the plot. All I was expecting was a good tale.  I found that the iconic status of the book was more impressive than the actual work, something not uncommon in the digital age. <br />The family of the young Jim Hawkins' runs a not quite prospering inn and everything seems to be going on its drudging way until a man with no name shows up. He bears a scar and a sea chest and comes to be known as \\"the captain\\". He spends most of his time boozing until some shady chracters show up to talk to him. The captain will draw Jim and his family into his past and a violent present after his death and the discovery of a treasure map. Jim's life will speed up to encompass pirates, pursuit, buried treasure, and that mascot of fish franchises, Long John Silver, and his ever-present parrot on his shoulder. No, the parrot's name is not Polly. <br />Treasure Island is a fast moving narrative that keeps on pumping energy on every page. Stevenson has a real talent at keeping you interested. The character of Jim is well-drawn as are most of the main characters. The problems come with the minor characters. The pirates are completely stupid and you wonder how they could have ever earned a living doing it because they are so incompetent. I really don't see why this book has the place it does in the canon of good literature. It's an average young adult novel.
B00008H2LE|1.0|As a person who spends a lot of money on music, I believe something needs to be said about this product. Linkin Park may have put out a fine product, but they only put out 36 minutes of worth of it. I find that to be a problem. I also consider it to be a problem because Warner Brothers saw fit to charge the public $...to buy the album. The public is getting the shaft and Linkin Park has not spoken out against this. What a shame. Artists complain about getting [cheated] by their labels but they don't seem to mind if their fans do. Come on Linkin Park, let us here what you have to say.

B00007EBAG|1.0|What in the world has happened to Terence Trent D'Arby? Gone is the pop/soul/rock funkster whose previous efforts &quot;Neither Fish nor Flesh.&quot; &quot;Symphony or Damn&quot; and &quot;Vibrator&quot; were edgy, experimental and tons of fun to listen to and try to decipher.<br />What we've got now is an artist who may be at peace with himself and his new name (Sananda), but has lost his competitive edge. The songs on Wildcard (Jokers Edition) are blah. Too many lyrics, not enough hooks and nothing that sets the heart racing or the booty shaking.<br />One of the things I enjoyed most about TTD's previous albums was that none of the songs sounded the same. Instrumentation, production, tempo and presentation were completely changed as you moved from song to song. It gave the feeling that here is an artist who writes a completely original song from melody to lyrics to theme each time he sits down to compose. Sadly, that's missing from Wildcard, which sounds like a garage band going from tune to tune trying to put together a demo tape in search of its big break.<br />What I'm trying to articulate is that on many, many CDs you can hear the same instruments (i.e.- electric guitar, drums, bass and perhaps a piano) and production over and over, even if the lyrics, theme or tempo changes from song to song. D'Arby wasn't like that on his previous releases. It sounded as though he got a track down on tape, cleared the studio and brought in a fresh set of new players with different instruments to record the next track. (Yes, I'm aware that he played many of those instruments himself...but the variations were terrific.)<br />Even if the public at large tended to overlook to the &quot;old&quot; Terence Trent D'Arby, he received critical acclaim and was an awe-inspiring talent among artists &quot;in the know.&quot; I miss that guy. And the one who has replaced him is lacking all that made TTD spectacular.
B000089RVX|4.0|This is a great album, I think it has done the best so far in the sense of integrating a good female voice with some Rocking tunes. I give this album 2 thumbs up!
B00008PW3O|5.0|Let me just start out by saying that I am a new age person. Yes this is going somewhere and this is how I write reviews. Let me just start by saying that this is one of the best fleetwood mac cds i have ever heard. To hear the evolution of a goddess and her god is amazing. In a room with inscence burning she puts you there. Outside with the sun shining bright he puts you there. Their evolution has lead to one of the most intriguing, tentalating, sophisticated and etheral recordings of history. Here comes the grim part. I am in my room listening to this wonderful cd and &quot;Illume (9-11)&quot; comes on and there I am. In the towers when the people rush out and when they fall. I cried when I first heard the song. If you are a Fleetwood Mac fan or if you just like to hear stevies voice then I suggest you buy the cd and listen to it over and over. Plus the other songs on the album such as &quot;Peacekeeper&quot; and &quot;Bleed to love her&quot; are technically sound with Fleetwood style music. I am 23 now and have been listening to fleetwood and stevie for somewhere close to ten or twelve years now. This is the most mature and etheral cd to date. If you are a writer or poet this is a must have.

0553296981|3.0|The story \\"Anne Frank: The diary of a young Girl\\" by Anne Frank is a story about Anne's life as a little Jewish girl living in hiding with a group of seven other Jewish people during World War Two. In her diary Anne expresses her thoughts and feelings almost every day in her diary. Anne received her diary for her birthday and named it Kitty. Anne named her diary Kitty because of the possibility of someone reading her diary, this way no one would know who she was talking to. Anne's diary is very important because it is one of the few personal historical documents of that time and situation because the others were destroyed.<br /> I can relate to Anne Frank for many reasons. The number one reason is her odd but impressive outlook on life that Anne expresses throughout her diary for the two years in hiding. Anne's feelings on topics such as boys, family, and the future are very similar to children all around the world today.  Anne seems to be picky about boys, and Anne doesn't like the boys her mother likes. In the story Anne mentions that her mother would like her to marry some boy that Anne finds annoying and disgusting. Anne loves her family even her mother who she constantly argues with. Anne and her mother fight all the time making her mother feel Anne did not like her. Anne looks at the future with hope and fear just like children today. Anne hopes that things will get better and fears that things will get worse.<br /> The dates are an important part of the book. For example, the first diary entry takes place Sunday, June 14, 1942.  This was Anne's birthday.  After that day until Anne's diary ends on August 4, 1944, Anne shares her arrival into hiding, her arguments, her first kiss, and information on the war. On the very last page of the book we are told that on \\"March 1945, two months before the liberation of Holland, Anne died in the concentration camp.\\" After sharing Anne's feelings, her entire life story, and her hopes and dreams as I came to the end of her diary I hoped things would end up okay for Anne and her family, but in reality the end of Anne's life was only two months after the end of this story. Anne did not end up with the happy ending that she deserved.<br />This novel was a big wake up call that reminded me that not everyone has got it good.  I would recommend this book to every boy and girl in the United States to remind him or her of Hitler's cruel ways and the struggle that he put Jewish men, woman, and children through. My recommendations are to read the story \\"Anne Frank: Diary of a Young Girl\\" and to think how hard it really was for not only the people in hiding but the poor people that were stolen from their homes and placed in dirty concentration camps and killed for no particular reason at all.  This is a great book and a great learning experience.diary I hoped things would end up okay for Anne and her family, but in reality the end of Anne's life was only two months after the end of this story.

B00005K3OT|4.0|This is a lovely little movie set in a quaint French village, with Juliette Binoche as the chocolatiere who stirs up this highly conformist place. Despite its 20th century setting, the village seems to have been caught in a time warp; evidence a lady in mourning for her husband who died in World War I!! The Mayor, of aristocratic descent, is the de facto seigneur of the village and nothing is too small for his touch. He manages his rented properties as a benevolent landlord, where the commercial rental relationship is almost subordinate to the underlying feudal loyalty. At the root of the village's life, he literally instructs the village priest on the sermon to be preached at Sunday mass. His focus is to keep the village faithful to the traditions of the past, including those of his own aristocratic ancestors. Deserted by his wife, a desertion he cannot comprehend and tries stubbornly to deny, his retreat for comfort into orthodox Christianity is stalled by the entry of Binoche. A non-conformist to the core, Binoche gently but firmly turns the quiet village topsy-turvy, not so much by open confrontation of established village norms, but rather by simply ignoring those norms she considers irrelevant - be they attending the Church or refusing to fudge her single mother status. Chocolate, once known as the food of the gods, here is a metaphor as Binoche uses her tempting concoctions to entice and provoke the villagers into questioning their lives and perhaps changing them for the better. There are no real bad guys here (barring Serge) : for all his prissiness, the Mayor is a decent man adrift in a world he cannot control. Nor is the teaching one-sided: At the end of the movie, Binoche has been changed as much as the villagers. The movie is strewn with cameos but the limelight is easily stolen by Judy Dench as the irascible and ailing Armande and Johnny Depp as the relaxed river rat. Maybe not a great movie, but a good one nonetheless.
B000059HAI|5.0|Tora! Tora! Tora! remains an unprecedented motion picture achievement, a film presenting both sides of the attack on Pearl Harbor in a fact-based style rather than delving into such fictional storylines as star-crossed lovers for the heart of its presentation.  In a very real way, it is two movies in one, with one production crew telling the Japanese side of the story and another telling the American side.  All of the Japanese dialogue is subtitled in English, and this makes for a much more effective presentation than dubbing ever could.  There are a good many important characters on each side, with each one identified at his first appearance, but the necessarily somewhat choppy style of presentation can make it difficult to keep different characters distinguished at times.  The actors, for their part, are top-notch, with the American cast including such stalwarts as Jason Robards, Joseph Cotton, and E.G. Marshall.  Soh Yamamura gives a powerful portrayal of Japanese Admiral Yamamoto, the man who is in many ways the centerpiece of this drama and the character on whom the filmmakers rely in presenting the real message they attempt to convey.  While the diplomatic maneuvering and piling up of unforgivable American blunders in the weeks leading up to December 7, 1941, are quite interesting in and of themselves, it is the final 30-minute battle sequence that gives Tora! Tora! Tora! its real claim to fame.  This movie was released in 1970, but the special effects rival if not surpass, at least in my opinion, anything you see filmmakers doing today.  The explosions and carnage on the ground as well as the aerial maneuvers and dogfights in the air are just breathtakingly stunning.  No film can ever recapture the depth and destruction of the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, but this movie is really quite extraordinarily realistic in its presentation.<br />While this is a fact-based account of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, one cannot proclaim it historically complete and accurate.  The Japanese, particularly in the person of Admiral Yamamoto, are presented in something of a sympathetic light.  Certainly, there were elements in the Japanese military who disagreed with such a bold attack against a potentially overpowering enemy, but this movie seems to shy away from assigning blame for such a cowardly first strike against American forces in the Pacific.  Certainly, there were diplomatic blunders that can explain Japan's violation of the Geneva Conventions but nevertheless such infamous things did happen.  On the American side, one is treated to an infuriatingly long list of incompetent men, actions, and decisions.  The blame for the disaster is spread widely as it should be, taking into account such matters as the incomprehensible decision of keeping all available planes parked closely together on the ground as well as the refusal of army brass in Washington to read signs that blazed as brightly as day from intercepted Japanese dispatches and warnings from a number of military and intelligence sources, but the movie never penetrates the doors of the White House to ask just what FDR knew and when he knew it, nor does it ask any questions at all of the British and the secret information Winston Churchill chose not to share with his American \\"ally.\\"  For me to criticize this movie for ignoring these most controversial issues back in 1970 is just minor quibbling, however, as I truly deem this film to be perhaps the most realistic and impressive war movie ever made.  Its manner of presentation, dealing with events rather than central characters, is a weakness of sorts, one that saw it overshadowed in the year of its own release by George C. Scott's masterful portrayal of Patton, but clearly Tora! Tora! Tora! remains the definitive motion picture representation of the day that will live in infamy and the acts, decisions, and mistakes that led up to it.and accurate.

B00008PW3Q|5.0|While the Rumours sound was one aspect of Fleetwood Mac's fame, the interesting twists and turns in texture and variety have also been a mainstay of their music. Tusk anybody? This album has it all. Christine is gone and not forgotten, but this is a new chapter in the Mac's book. It's a very good one. There is so much they could have fallen back on, but they haven't. Stevie is in far better voice than she was on her last solo album - the best, most impassioned vocals from her in years. Her songwriting strengths remain intact. Lindsey's songwriting is as wide-ranging and emotional as ever. The input from the rhythm section is the most exciting it's been from Mick and John in years! The songs are laced with hooks and edges that make them something so much more interesting than some of their own past efforts, like Mirage. The disc is a little darker than some might expect from this group, but it's not without purpose as there is depth and emotion and great thought in these songs. This band is very much alive! They've made a super and long (no complaints here!) album of vital music. They've very much remained true to the spirit of Fleetwood Mac -- the spirit of warmth and invention and heart.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I absolutely love Moulin Rouge.  I have never seen anything at all like this movie; it is nothing short of indescribable.  Previews and descriptions offer only the smallest glimpse into the epic world of intense human emotion, amazing sets, and incredible music that is Moulin Rouge.  The setting is Paris in 1900, where the Moulin Rouge is the place to be, a spectacularly unreal world wherein inhibitions are left at the door and beauty, truth, freedom, and love are pursued on an epic scale.  Ewan McGregor plays Christian, a young, idealistic, penniless poet who has come to Paris to embrace the bohemian spirit flourishing there.  He soon finds himself writing songs for a lavish production alongside a truly unforgettable cast of characters led by Toulouse Lautrec (John Leguizamo).  His new friends are awestruck by the lines and lyrics he comes up with, all of which are drawn from the pop culture of our own modern day.  A shot of absinthe and a vision of the Green Fairy (played by the lovely Kylie Minogue) later, he finds himself inside Moulin Rouge.  Harold Zidler (Jim Broadbent) leads the way for one of the most lavish musical production numbers ever created on film, topped off by the appearance of Satine (Nicole Kidman) on a huge swing above the amazingly enthusiastic audience.  Despite the odds, Christian and Satine fall in love, but they must keep their love hidden because the club's wealthy patron, The Duke (Richard Roxburgh), wants Satine for himself and is willing to make her the real actress she longs to be in return for her affections.  I was rather surprised to discover such a deeply emotional tale at the heart of this movie; it is a beautiful but tragic love story that outshines even the incredibly lavish production numbers for which this film is most famous.<br />I love musicals, but I had come to doubt the ability of modern moviemakers to make one worth seeing.  What director Baz Luhrmann has done is to actually reinvent the musical as audiences know it.  It sounds strange to say that the music for a movie set in 1900 consists of modern pop, opera, hip-hop, and other songs of the late twentieth century, but it really works beautifully and draws the modern viewer more deeply into the world of \\"real artificiality\\" Luhrmann succeeded in creating.  If you had asked my thoughts on having two guys who look like David Spade and Rip Taylor singing Madonna's Like a Virgin in a movie, I would have laughed you out the door, yet it actually works in Moulin Rouge.  Each of the terrific songs included here does serve rather than detract from the story itself.  Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman do actually sing their own songs, it is important to note, and I was amazed to discover that Kidman's singing voice is as beautiful as she is herself.  Dialogue alone could never manufacture the power unleashed by the music of Moulin Rouge, and the great tragedy of the story is made even more poignant by songs such as the haunting Come What May.  Don't think this movie uses its garish production numbers as a means of hiding a weak story because the love story of Christian and Satine is nothing short of breathtaking, heartbreaking, and somehow wondrously beautiful all at the same time.<br />A terrific movie deserves a terrific DVD release, and Moulin Rouge features more extras than I could even watch all at once.  When you watch the movie, you will marvel at the sets and costumes and wonder how on earth this movie was made.  There are features on just about every aspect of the making of Moulin Rouge included on Disc Two.  I love the commentaries and interviews, but what I really love are the uncut dance sequences.  The dance numbers in this movie are just beautiful and beyond amazing, but they cannot be shown uncut in the film itself because things are happening story-wise at the same time and those scenes take precedence over the dances.  Here, not only can you watch each of these musical production numbers in its completeness, you can even watch each one from multiple camera angles.<br />I know there are some people who dismiss this movie out of hand because it is a musical or because the hedonistic themes revealed in the movie previews give the impression of gaudiness over substance.  This is not a musical in the traditional sense of the word, and the sets, while opulently lavish, are actually less stunning than the plot itself.  This is a love story for the ages, sprinkled with comedy but dominated by the deepest of human emotions.  Even though I was interested in this movie from the time it was released, I myself did not expect story itself to be as powerful and moving as it is.

So I ran out and bought Linkin Park (4 stars)and said where is that song with the girl?<BR>Well, after a little investigation at the record store, I came to discover this album.   <br />I absolutely love this group.....ONE SUGGestion....Do a remix album with the guy from 12 stones.  Add more of the duet and rap style to the songs \\"going under\\" and \\"everybodys fool\\".  After hearing the \\"bring me life\\" duet style, I was longing to hear more of the same.......They could make a superior remix CD and sell even more copies than the original..........   <br />If you want a synopsis of this band?

B00005JLEU|5.0|This movie is the best one I have ever seen, you should get the DVD.  It is not that much more expensive but the japanese dialouge is better than enlish.  This movie may look a little odd but it is a mix of adventure and mystery.  At first you may be a little confused but if you watch the whole thing, every single detail will be explained.  This is a movie for the whole family.  My brothers hate cartoons yet they loved this movie.  You have too watch this movie from beginning to end, if you don't, not only will you be confused but you will blow the fantastic ending.  I never cry during movies but my eyes welled up at the end of this movie.  Two thumbs up to Hayao Miyazaki!
B000002B30|2.0|You can chastise me as a biased die-hard, but \\"Bruce Springsteen - Greatest Hits\\" was such a waste of potential. An artist this prolific could NEVER be compiled on just one 80 minute disc!  The same goes for Tom Petty and Bob Seger. <br />I'll keep this short and sweet, his first two albums were COMPLETELY ignored. Not even 1 song a piece? Why not include HITS like \\"Blinded by the light\\" and \\"Rosalita\\"? I'm left scratching my head. Furthermore the sound quality of \\"Born to Run\\", \\"Thunder Road\\" and \\"Badlands\\" included here needs a major revamping. They lack the crispness of the album versions.<br />Their aren't much bigger hits than Top 10 Charting singles right? Well Hits \\"I'm going down\\", Cover me, and \\"I'm on fire\\" from Born in the U.S.A were inexplicably overlooked. And Lastly, from Tunnel of Love, the title track would have been a better choice, as it received far more airplay than the album's lone song here, \\"Brilliant Disguise\\".<br />For someone like me so used to the albums, hearing the songs culled from Born in the U.S.A out of their original context was bizarre. \\"My Hometown\\" was the closing track, yet on Greatest Hits it precedes \\"Glory Days\\". Just seems so odd. The individual albums are a worthy investment, if you're on a budget  try and find 'em used. You'll save a bundle. My 2 Star rating is extremely generous.
B00000DP2V|3.0|Three years after their last album, &quot;In Through The Out Door,&quot; Led Zeppelin released this album of songs they did not release on their previous albums because, well, they were not good enough. You definitely get the feeling here that they are cleaning out the vaults and that everything, yes, absolutely everything must go.  The tracks that stand out are those dominated by the late John Bonham's frenetic drumming, &quot;Poor Tom&quot; and &quot;Bonzo's Montreaux,&quot; which certainly seems fitting, although with the latter it is more a celebration of the man because of a drum dominated song rather than the value of the song itself.  In fact, you end up wondering if Jimmy Page turned up the drum tracks before they released this one since Bonzo's drumming seems much more prominent than usual. The alternative version of &quot;I Can't Quit You Baby&quot; is interesting and offers Page's best work on the disc, and hints at what would be available when the group released the live versions they did for the BBC (n balance, a much better addition to your Led Zeppelin collection that this one). . Most of these tracks, such as &quot;Ozone Baby,&quot; &quot;Darlene&quot; and &quot;Wearing and Tearing,&quot; are hard rockers that you would readily identify as being from the period when Led Zep was working on &quot;Physical Graffiti.&quot;  The question is how much do you value average Led Zeppelin songs?  Most Led Zeppelin fans will listen to this one a couple of times and then go back to the favorites among the \\"real\\" albums.
B00003CXXJ|3.0|WARNING : I give away the  ending of this film. Don't read if you haven't seen the film .<br /><br />First, the film is funny, it has a lot of good lines, the quality of the work is very high....But...<br /><br />I have misgivings about this film. <br /><br />It's not the \\"vulgarity\\" of the film that bothers me, and let me take a moment to expres my condolences to the unfortunate children who have to put up with the parents who've ranted about the (very mild) belch and fart jokes in this film. Hang in there , kids ; age 18 is coming.<br /><br />No , what bothers me is this :<BR><br /><br />Princess Fiona is a human female. Her genotype/phenotype is that of a tall, slender redhead. That's what she's MEANT  to look like. Her ogreish appearance after sundown and before sunrise is solely the result of a curse or evil spell, and it will be broken by \\"love's first kiss\\". <br /><br />So she and Shrek fall in love, he kisses her....and she's left permanently in the ogreish form.<br /><br />Exactly  WHAT message is that supposed to send, anyway? Is it \\"don't judge by appearances\\" ? Well, how *can* it be, when apparently Princess Fiona MUST  look like Shrek to make it believable that she truly loves him? Are we supposed to believe that if she stayed beautiful, she'd eventually  \\"have to\\" dump  Shrek and find someone her physical equal? If they  really, truly love each other, WHY can't Fiona keep the face and form she was BORN to have-why does she have to look like Shrek for it to be believed that she truly loves him? Far from being an antilookist message, it's as if the filmmakers are saying, 'if you're ugly, you'll only find true love with someone who looks just like you. Forget \\"love conquers all\\", or \\"opposites attract\\", and don't get above yourself : Your inner worth means NOTHING , it's only your outward appearance that counts.<br /><br />Or is it rather that, as a female, Princess Fiona is just destined to be an appendage of whatever man she chooses, so of course she has to match her mate? Like she isn't an individual in her own right.<br /><br />I really don't think I'm making too big a deal over \\"just a kid's film\\" here. Adults are allowed to just enjoy themselves and have fun with 'eye candy' TV shows and films, or beach novels. Everything for kids is so didactic it hurts, and no story for them is allowed to just be fun ; no, everything has to \\"teach them a  good lesson\\". Just like every freakin'  toy for kids has to be some educational instrument of torture from Zany Brainy or some boredom factory like it. Can't turn children into little production instruments too soon, can we ? How are they supposed to grow up and make good money so they can support their parents, if they're allowed to just play and fantasize and day dream as children?<br /><br />So it's safe to say that this film is meant to teach children A Lesson....and I think it is quite appropriate to question just what message it sends.<br />
B00008DDSC|1.0|I did a search for black comedy movies and was happy to have found a newer release of a film of which I had not heard of. This is not a good movie! I hated every second of it. The acting was utterly horrible and one can feel no emotion for any character involved. The people in this movie live in a unbelievably fake world. I am a fan of black comedy movies like Storytelling, Welcome to the Dollhouse, American Beauty, and tv series like 6 Feet Under (on HBO), etc. but this is the worst so called black comedy I have ever sat through! It is a pure waste of time...that is unless you enjoy dream land and no depth in a character.
078322947X|5.0|This movie has got to be the best sleeper hit ever! The music the effects its all top notch. I would really like to know how they filmed the bridge sceen, the things they do with the trucks are just plain remarkable! I wish there was a making of feature on the disk. maybe sometime in the future they will make a special edition disk and even if they don't I will still be happy with what I have.
B00008PW3Q|3.0|This new  album from Fleetwood Mac is quite listenable but there are many songs  on this album that should have not have been included or used on this album. Highlights on the Album include, \\"Say You Will\\", \\"Thrown Down\\", \\"Steal Your Heart Away\\", \\"Peacekeeper\\", \\"Miranda\\" and \\"Bleed to Love Her\\". However strange Buckingham songs such as \\"Red Rover and \\"Come\\" put this album down. Also the Nicks tunes, \\"Smile at You\\", \\"Running Through the Garden\\", \\"Silver Girl\\", and \\"Everyone Finds Out are very average songs and are nothing more than \\"fillers\\". This album is an ok effort from a band that lost a major member, Christine McVie to retirement but her voice and songwriting could have helped this album.
B00005JLK0|5.0|THE WORLD HAS BEEN SAVED. A GREAT SCARY MOVIE FOR EVERYONE WHO IS ANYONE. BRAVO.
0385507755|5.0|What a story.  Around every turn this is intense drama reflective of the hard, intense, honest life James has lead.  The first half of the book is gripping - the pain, the &quot;toughness&quot;, the fear is very moving.  At the same time you love and pity James - yet you always respect his determination.<br />The second half of the book is about building self-esteem, friendship and trust.  <br />The entire book is very moving and well written.  <br />A million little pieces is one perfect masterpiece.  A MUST READ.
B000083LQB|5.0|While Dirty is possibly one of the greatest \\"rock\\" albums ever made, you shouldn't let the term fool you.  Refusing to be restrained by mainstream requirements, Sonic Youth uses a deep rock foundation to enhance their music, not limit it, which results in a record that is jarring, surreal, abrasive and calming all at once.  Perhaps inspired by the antics of their more straightforward peers, i.e. Mudhoney and Nirvana, Dirty definitely marks the beginning of a more riff based approach for the consistently abrasive New York Ensemble, but while bands like Mudhoney and Nirvana quickly embraced an entirely formulaic method of songwriting, Sonic Youth merely uses this style to bring the jagged edges and metallic skronk of their vision to the forefront.  Therefore, none of the classic SY elements are lost as the band further explores the concepts of repeated bludgeoning power chords overlaid with impassioned vocals and the results nearly defy description.  Although every member of Sonic Youth is able to get into the driving grooves of tracks like \\"Purr\\" or \\"100%,\\" they also feel right at home while indulging in psychedelic, feedback laden meditations such as \\"Theresa's Sound World\\" or \\"JC,\\" thereby straddling the gap between the fierce testosterone riddled world of rock and the brooding, experimental underbelly of Avant Garde.  The diverse assortment of styles and the wide range of sounds cleverly placed side by side makes Dirty an experience that keeps the listener attentive, lulling him or her into a relaxed calm at one moment only to bombard his or her ears with brutal guitar fuzz the next.  An album that can overwhelm as much as entice, Dirty is a complex array of various ideas and motives, which makes classifying it as a great rock album an incredible oversimplification.  Instead, Dirty is best viewed as being the point where rock and the anti-rock meet, a chaotic orgasm of opposing noise, and since Sonic Youth is the band who has shared the stage with everyone from Nirvana to the Boredoms, cited influences from Neil Young to The Carpenters, and played everything from No Wave to Alt. Rock, they alone are the only band who could create such an ideal model of diverse excellence. <br />In regards to the re-release of Dirty in 2003, the actual re-releasing of this album was pretty unnecessary considering the original album is still widely available in CD stores across the world, but obviously, the previously unavailable or ridiculously difficult to obtain bonus material included on the new version of Dirty, is a nice addition.  Immediately following the original LP, all of the B sides are quite good, but none of them ever really reach the perfect equilibrium of Dirty, always leaning more towards either experimentalism or rock instead of a balanced fusion.  The rehearsal jams however are fascinating to no end.  Certainly a precursor to the current SYR series, the Dirty rehearsal jams chronicle the improvisations, brainstorming sessions, and noise experiments that eventually led to the group's cohesive full length album.  Hearing tracks like Wish Fulfillment and Swimsuit Issue in their embryonic stages along with transitional improvised pieces is definitely an intriguing prospect and thanks to the reissue of Dirty, this is now possible.  Without question, the album itself is the strongest, most developed material culled from the expansive Dirty sessions, but as the reissue proves, there are still many more worthwhile tracks which got left off of the original.
014100018X|4.0|This is a must read for women.  I saw the movie and thought it was so-so.  The book gives so much more detail about the characters lives and their history they almost come to life. If you saw the movie and it left you wanting more the book will give you insight into the motivation and psychology behind the action.  If you did not see the movie, read the book first!
B000089CJI|5.0|This record is one of the premier albums in any genre currently available. The way the songs are put together are masterful, as the vocals compliment the beats flawlessly. Pop hooks, melodic beats and well written lyrics make this an enjoyable listen the entire way through. The songs &quot;Sleeping In&quot;, &quot;Such Great Things&quot; and &quot;The District Sleeps Alone&quot; are the highlights of the record as all three tracks accent the different stylings of the Postal Service most distinctly. Get this record, show it to your friends, co workers, fellow students, peers and anyone else who might have lived in the 80's. They will admire and appreciate the creativity within it, and more than likely you'll be able to catch them in the near future nodding their heads to the catchy hooks of the Postal Service.
B00005JKCH|3.0|3 Stars. Okay, I'm a teenager and heard all the hype about this movie and how it was sooooo great, and how everyone has to see it. So, I bought it on dvd when it came out. This must be a mistake! How could a movie like this make 115 million dollars its first week? Its not a horrible movie, but the only redeeming value in this movie is the special effects,  the action, and the bonus features if you're into that kind of thing. The acting is not amazing. This movie is good for a renting, but don't buy it unless you really love it, cause after watching it more than twice, as I had it got boring.
B00005LLK8|5.0|I watched this film when it first came out.  I didn't think much much of it then.  I just watched it again and wow!  It is a story of a coal miner and his son(s).  The younger one has to take boxing lessons and in doing so discovers the world of ballet.  He uses the boxing lesson money for ballet and...The reaction of his dad and older brother to his dancing makes the film.  Throw in a poof! as the gay young friend is called and we have some comic relief.<BR>I don't cry during films but this one I did twice. you'll like it
B00006J3WH|4.0|When this episode first aired I was out of town and I missed it! I was so angry because I remembered how anxious I was to watch it being such a HUGE fan of both Buffy and Musicals. It aired on FX just a while ago and I absoloutley LOVED IT! By far the most creative and fantastic episode of Buffy to this day. Every single song was wonderful in it's own way, and I was surprised to see everyone casted on Buffy can sing very well.. and you can tell it's actually them! Rest in Peace is my favorite track on the cd, it's got a nice beat to it and it's just cool. I really love this cd and I'm glad I bought it! I wish i could find the musical episode on dvd because it's so great! It's about a demon that Xander summons *which isn't revealed unitll the end* that makes everyone respond in song and dance, untill they finally combust. It's an episode everyone can enjoy, though I had some friends who didn't like it because they don't like musicals, but if you do and maybe if you don't you will LOVE it
B000089RVX|2.0|This album continues the trend of modern rock bands with sub-par instrumentals relying on catchy hooks to carry them.  Drums often sound programmed, and even when there is real drumming it gets stale fast.  I think the guitar tracks were all copied and pasted from a Linkin Park cd in Pro Tools.  The bass, well, if you manage to hear it in the guitar noise you are a better man than I.<br />After all of that, this band has some redeeming qualities.  The vocals are gorgeous, and the songs actually sound original, even if the arrangments are stale.  What makes this band so sad is that they really could be good, but they weren't willing to put out the effort to do something original... shame, shame, shame.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|If you're into the bizarre, the unexpected, multiple twists and turns...and a good scare...see &quot;Donnie Darko&quot;.  It is a compelling, hypnotic masterpiece that had me turning my head from side to side trying to figure out the plot...better yet...the whole purpose of this film.  When it all comes together in the end, you begin putting all of the pieces in place. It is unpredictable, masterfully edited and scripted, and you just can't go wrong with a cast like this.  It is one of the most entertaining and though-provoking films I have ever seen.  Don't rent it...BUY IT!  You'll want to go back for more.
B00005MAM2|5.0|First and foremost I'd like to state that Akira is not the movie to play as a way to kill time with youngters, this movie is far too graphic and violent for the 12 and under crowd. However it is what many people consider to be the best anime movie ever. <br />Regardless of your or anyone's opinion this IS the movie that started a generation of anime. It was NOT Princess Mononoke (but that WAS a rather good movie nonetheless). The year was 1988 and Tokyo recovering from the devastation that was world war three, was destroyed by a powerful entity named Akira...<br />A generation later in the depths of the old city of Neo Tokyo rival biker gangs run rampant in the streets. Among these gangs are two childhood friends Kenada and Tetsuo. In a battle with the rival gang the clowns, Tetsuo gets seperated from his friends and comes across a strange boy. The boy is in fact a secret military project and he has latent phsycic abililties. He injures Tetsuo, and afterwards Tetsuo is abducted by the military, he is subjected to tests that give him powers that rival Akira's (who has long since died) now Kenada must stop Tetsuo as he threatens the world and in higher perspectives the entire universe and the very fabric of time.<br />In short this movie has great animation and characters although it may be hard to understand without subtitles as all anime movies are. The bikes in this movie are simply AWESOME and I definitaly recommend this movie to you.
B00000G3Q4|5.0|\\"The Evil Dead\\" is one serious horror masterpiece. It makes \\"The Exorcist\\" look like a \\"G\\" rated film. My flesh is still crawling...it will definitely give anyone nightmares, and this digitally remastered version has it all. I bought the Special Edition on DVD. I have never seen more gore, greater sound, so many jump-out-of-your-skin scenes in my life. If you are a horror fan...and have a strong stomach...this one's for you. No kidding everyone...this is a SERIOUS film. It was rated NC-17 when it first came out in 1982. It should stay that way! I was raised on horror films, but I never thought they'd go this far!!! The setting is a deserted cabin in the woods. For 85 minutes you never leave it...nor do you want to! Don't go into the woods! Whatever you do, don't go into the woods! Of all people, I may not sleep well tonight. This film accomplished what I thought no horror flick could ever do...it scared the %$#( out of me. There have been \\"moments\\" in other films, but this one is non-stop. I think I'll take a break now and go watch \\"Peter Cottontail\\" or something. Wanna get scared? Wanna venture deep into the horror genre'? See \\"The Evil Dead\\" and don't let anyone or anything interrupt you. It's better than any thrill ride I've ever been on. It takes your stomach to the same place. I gave it 5 stars on Amazon.com scale.  It deserves a 6.  Don't rent this.  Buy it!  It's one you'll want to relive over and over again when you need/want a good scare...or need/want to scare others.
6304698682|5.0|After almost a full decade away from the western genre, Clint Eastwood was presented with the script for this melodramatic but very powerful western.  Taking up his usual roles as producer, director and of course star, Eastwood handles each role admirably and ultimately put a classic western on the silver screen and the home theater screen.  Of particular note is the score for the film, which but for the beginning and the end of the film is almost nonexistent but very ominous and powerful when present.<br />The premise:<br />Welcome to Carbon Creek California where a group of tin pan miners are demoralized and ready to quit due to the efforts of mining boss Coy LaHood (Richard Dysart) and his men.  In what can only be described as prophetic, after the opening sequence, young Megan (Sydney Penny) is burying her dog, praying for a miracle and we see the Preacher (Clint Eastwood) riding into town.  We then see Hull Barret (Michael Moriarty) riding into town despite warnings about what happened to him the last time he went there.  In classic Eastwood style, Barret is being beaten brutally in the middle of town and Eastwood as the stranger saves the day.  What follows may not be Eastwood's best western of his career but it certainly has a very intriguing and poignant plot that is quite memorable.<br />I would highly recommend this film to die hard Eastwood fans or the casual western fan as I believe you will find yourself pleasantly surprised by this film.  {ssintrepid}<br />Special Features:<br />Production notes:  A text script written by Eastwood about directing and the standard actors list with their credits.<br />Theatrical trailers:  Pale Rider and Unforgiven
0316666343|4.0|I thought that this book was a great quick read.  The author made us feel confident in her depiction of what happens after death.  However, I think  that the last 1/3 of the book was really disappointing!  The author took us to a place that was not believable and I didn't like the way she handled George Harvey...
6301247485|5.0|I loved this movie.  The casting was superb, the costumes brilliant, the score fabulous and the story gripping, tragic and faithful to the book.  I was not surprised to read that Fitzgerald wrote this book, while based in Paris, because although an essentially American tale it simple reeks of European decadence and obscene, useless excess.  I do not believe an American mistress would not squirrel away at least some of the money given to her, if only to leave her husband, or have her hair done. Not since Camille or Nana has a whore/mistress been represented as so stupidly self-destructive, yet this film made it believable.  Gatsby reminded me of the heroes of Goethe and Chekov, what a shame!!! what a waste!! and yet he was so American.  This Redford portrayed so well, he missed, as was meant, the dour, dark, suicidal tragedy of the European hero, replacing it with the can-do bust-through new-money air even though in the end he was not to be allowed to do so, because of the will-not-be-done-out-of-my-share misguided resentment and ignorance of the cuckolded huband.  Daisy however had all the lightness, thoughtlessness and money needed to cause, continue and blithely survive the consequences of her actions.  She floated through the film as only Mia could, not looking in the corners, not furnishing the house or checking the doors or burglar alarm, NOT BEING CAREFUL. And whether we feel she was worth it or not - Gatsby would not have had it any other way, nor would Scott Fitzgerald, because, Scott loved Zelda and Gatsby loved Daisy, whatever the cost, even though neither Daisy nor Zelda really cared.   CONGRATULATIONS COPPOLA, IT'S UP THERE WITH THE GODFATHER
B00005UWCV|3.0|This is a cute movie, but not one that you (or your kids) want to watch over & over like The Lion King and Toy Story.  A good movie - just not as likeable as the others I mentioned.  My suggestion, rent it before you buy it. THis way you are sure it is worthy of being a part of your library.<br /><br />1smileycat :-)
B00005V3Z4|5.0|Anyone who loved Memento is going to fall for Darko! I consider Mr. Kelly's mind Dark, Beautiful and Brilliant. An original way to place time traveling in a disturbed boy's mind. Every detail of the movie is perfectly taken care of,  <br />In this outstanding role, Jake gave the performance of a lifetime with convincing authenticity and naturalness the role fits him perfectly! Drew Barrymore makes a real combination of a mature woman and a naïve, but responsible teacher; as well as Jena Malone as Donnie's girl was traumatic in a good way. Also, who can forget the rabbit that asks \\"why are we wearing this stupid man suit?\\" also we know that Grandma Death could use some time traveling herself but she is a key element to the psyche of the story.<br />It is a psychological thriller with a little bit of dark comedy that everybody will love, even if you do not understand it you will be thinking about it and watching it over and over again hoping to find more clues. I personally lend this movie to some of my friends, I thought that they were not going to like it but there we were talking about Donnie, the smurf analysis and the Bunny Rabbit at some point of the day. <br />Donnie Darko is a Tremendous Rendezvous of thoughts, ideas, feelings, and facts that almost has you questioning yourself \\"is this possible?\\"
B00008J4P5|4.0|One guitar, one voice, one set of drums. Limiting? Forget it. This, and unless I'm going to be very mistaken, together with the forthcoming Yeah Yeah Yeahs debut show that this, in the right hands, can be the most liberating of line-ups. Primal. Earthy. Just proper. Just rock 'n' roll.<BR>The NME had this as one of their Top 100 Albums of all-time before it was even released. Which may or may not be ridiculous.<BR>So what you have to do is ignore stuff like that and just listen to the music...<br />'Seven Nations Army' sets it up. The de-tuned guitar intro leading into the woozy guitar blasting out of each verse. Which for me is just fine but leads to criticism, the criticism of this band : That This Is Nothing New. Mmmm, well, maybe. And maybe, so what. It is clear that the main inspiration here is the blues and to some extent this is music as old as the hills. But then there are rock stylings and aggression ( 'Black Math' could be hardcore, if it wasn't so schizophrenic...)and a singular personality/force of will that is Jack White. And then more than a dash of Pixies. Which is obviously a good thing.<BR>'There's No Home For You' is end-of-the-affair bitterness time and manages to evoke Hendrix, Dylan and, er, Queen pretty much simultaneously. The Bacharach and David cover, 'I Just Don't Know What To Do With Myself' could be a Jack White original and therein maybe lies the answer : melding everything you can take from the past and arriving at your own identity. And the future.<BR>You will want special stuff, special moments...Okay, Meg's vocals on 'In The Cold, Cold Night' are as down and dirty as you could possibly hope for; the glam 'oh-oh-oh' refrain on 'Little Acorns' is as unexpected as it is welcome; and really there is a lightness to a lot of this that may come as a surprise. The great piano work by Jack on 'I Want To Be The Boy To Warm Your Mother's Heart' in particular stands out. And the classic vocal performance.<BR>So is this a classic?<BR>Well, it's too soon to tell, I suppose.<BR>There is little of the straightforward catchy nature of 'Hotel Yorba' here from the predecessor, 'White Blood Cells', save for perhaps 'Hypnotise' but that is not the point. This is The White Stripes at the top of their game. There is a depth to the songwriting here which genuinely excites. And immediately you know that it's an album which will last. I love the maybe-improvised last song with its knockabout lyrics ( &quot; Meg, do you think Jack really loves me?&quot; followed by &quot; You know, I don't care because Jack really bugs me...&quot; ) although then we're at the end.<BR>How good, then, at the end of the day... <BR>Okay, it is a very good album, maybe a great one but time will tell. All I do know is that it's primal, it's earthy, it's just rock 'n' roll. And that's really as old as the hills...And maybe all you need to know.
B00008H2LB|5.0|If you like &quot;Somewhere I Belong&quot; then buy the CD. It is VERY solid. Overall, better than Hybrid Theory. Pick it up.
B00006LIRI|5.0|About five years ago I was doing a road trip around France and a self-declared music Connoisseur was looking through my albums.  He dismissed that they were 'Not bad' but said 'Katrine, you really don't learn the most about music from 'Best of' Albums.'  This comment has stuck with me from that day forward and I feel U2's latest compilation is proof that this is not the case.  There is a simple pleasure derived in this age of mixing one's own CDs, of letting an album play all the way through and not once wanting to skip tracks and this is definately the case with this offering.  <BR>During a pretty pathetic time for pop music U2 produced memorable hits in their albums Atchung Baby and Pop.  These are now blended with their latest singles the hauntingly beautiful 'The Hands that Built Ameirca' from 'Gangs of New York' and the energetic 'Eletrical Storm.'<BR>Listen to this, and discard your remote, you won't need it.
B000008JI1|4.0|I own the Greatest Hits CD and the Crack A Smile CD, but this one is really all the Poison you'll need. I didn't think they had it in them, or should I say I didnt think Bret Micheals had it in him to actually sing with passion and dignity instead of about hot girls and party-hardy nights. Native Tongue shows Poison putting some guts in thier work for the first time, and with the slight exception of some cuts off of Crack, the only time. My biggest reason for loving this album? It's HEAVY, it actually bothers to ROCK. It's a much more powerful Poison than ever before and it came just at the right time for metal, circa 1993. Great solo's and a bluesy guitar just scream and the songwriting has real depth, like maybe the band decided to think about what they were writing about. If you hate Poison this one might change your mind. I like Poison, but still find thier very watery 80s pop-metal annoying and in need of some new hairspray. Native Tongue is your answer. Check out these tracks: \\"Stay Alive\\", \\"Body Talk\\", \\"Bring It Home\\", \\"Ain't That The Truth\\" \\"Bastard Son of A Thousand of a Thousand Blues\\", man Bret sounds good on that, and you won't catch me saying that that often. Check it out, man you'll be surprised at this album, oh yeah, then, go buy it.
B00000JLWW|5.0|Yes, Titanic is my favorite movie and yes, I do take a great deal of (good-natured and otherwise) abuse for it.<br />I could lie and say my favorite movie is something cool like \\"The Matrix\\" or \\"Batman\\" (which are among my all-time favorites, by the way!), but that would be dishonest (hence my Lord Alfred Douglas reference above!)<br />But there was a time when the WORLD loved this movie and for excellent reasons. Titanic is the only modern-day epic that can justifiably be compared to classics like \\"Gone With the Wind\\" and \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\". Its filled with romance, adventure, tragedy, humanity, etc, in a technically superior production. Its one of those wonderful times that art and commerce combined into a genuine crowd-pleaser.<br />I look forward to the day when all the closeted Titanic fans can once again say, \\"Yes, I love this movie, too!\\"
B000002AS3|4.0|So what if Oasis are no good now? In 1994 (has it leen that long??) they loaded, locked and rocked all over the world on their debut.<br /><br />The album opens with \\"Rock N Roll Star,\\" a ballsy rocker that is all throttle, and it never lets up. \\"Live Forever\\" was the lead single from the album and it's easy to hear why. The vocal melody is sweeter than cotton candy, while the music is both soaring (in the chorus) and rocking (in the closing 1:30.) The sneering vocals on \\"Cigarettes and Alcohol\\" are teriffic.<br /><br />\\"Digsy's Diner\\" swaggers with a fuzzed guitar and jazzy piano and the balladeering on \\"Slide Away\\" offers brief respite from the all-out rocking taking place around it.<br /><br />This album is available in used stores throughout the country, making sure that you have no excuse for not owning this CD. To paraphrase Nike, \\"Just Buy It.\\"
0441172717|5.0|I've been a Dune fan since the late '70's when I first picked up my mom's copy (she was a fan as well).  The early '70's \\"oil shortage\\" was still a recent event so the concept of artificial shortages of heavily-used commodities created for political and economic reasons (the over-arching theme of all the Dune books) had particular relevance to this impressionable teenager.<br />All through the \\"greed is good\\" '80's and \\"internet-a-go-go\\" '90's, I kept returning to the Dune stories and finding continuing relevance and insights which helped me understand the world around me.<br />In early September, 2001, I had the good fortune to take a plane trip with a friend who happened to be as devoted to Tolkien's Rings as I was to the Dune series.  (Our discussion would have made a Comparative Lit professor proud as we each vied to \\"prove\\" our stories were better than the other's!)  My arguments hinged on the premise that many of the themes and situations in the Dune stories were applicable to the real world (and this was a week before 9-11, which made them even more relevant!)<br />When people ask me to recommend books, Dune is always first on my list, followed by Dune Messiah and Children of Dune.  If you desire a complex, imaginative and morally ambiguous series of novels that have deep and continuing resonance to the world around you, try Dune.  At the very least, you'll be treated to a grand adventure story.  At the very best, you'll find a tremendous resource that you can return to again and again.
0316666343|4.0|I only read occasionally but if all books were like this I would read more often.  This book is a wonderful story that is funny, extremely sad and makes you want to continue to read more.<BR>Susie Salmon was murdered when she was fourteen years old.  Don't get angry with me just yet, I know you are probably thinking I gave away an important fact.  The story starts off with Susie already in heaven, so I didn't spoil your fun.  Susie watches her old life, which is filled with friends, family, teachers, neighbors etc.  Susie witnesses how their lives change without her.  She watches how they deal with her death.  Susie has a younger brother named Buckley and a younger sister named Lindsey.  Buckley is too young to understand the idea of death and Lindsey tries to cover her emotions and stand strong.  Her parent's marriage quickly changes.  Susie's grandmother comes to stay with the family.  When she first appears in the story it does not seem like she will be a big factor, but towards the end of the story you realize that she plays an important role in the family's healing process.  She has a way of helping even though her arrival is not what the family originally wanted. Susie also has to deal with being in heaven.  She goes into detail about \\"her heaven\\" and the people she shares it with.  Months go by and she watches, as her killer still has not been caught.  She watches her family and friends struggle with her death and eventually start to accept their loss and try to move on with their lives.  Before her death Susie and a boy named Ray share one small kiss.  He is still trying to mend and move on.  He is also involved in an event that is a major detail in the story's ending.  This event is really all Susie wants from her heaven, but you will have to read the story to discover what happens.<BR>This book makes you want to be with your loved ones.  It makes you think about your own life and making the most of it.  Whether you believe in heaven or not, no matter whatyour opinion of heaven might be, this book gives you an idea of what the author might think heaven is like.  I had a wonderful reading experience with this book.  It made me actually cry at times because as I said earlier, this book makes you appreciate what you have and it makes you want to be with the people you love.  For me, it made me want to spend more time with my parents. I think the roles of Buckley and Lindsey were very important.  Lindsey is forced to grow up very quickly; she takes on a great deal of responsibility.  This book shows her life step by step without her sister being there. At first, Buckley was too young to understand Susie's death, but it shows how the affect of his mother leaving, his grandmother's influence on him etc., helped mold him into the person he became.  Susie's parents struggled the most with her murder.  Her father takes on the responsibility to find her murderer.  Susie's mother undergoes some dramatic changes before she finds her way back to the family. Some people might think the heaven situation is unbelievable, others may not.  The most unrealistic part of the story takes place towards the ending.<BR>In conclusion, I would definitely recommend this book to anyone.  Even if you are not a fan of reading, its worth the time and effort.  If you love to read then I would be surprised if you haven't already read this book.  It is definitely worth looking at.  It is not a book that you get tired of and have to take a break from.  You won't want to put it down.
B00008AY3L|1.0|This CD is mis-labeled and should be considered Christian rock. I can find religeous undertones in almost every song.  Of all the musical directions that Ben could have gone into, given the diverse sounds of his earlier albums, this is the one that lost me as a fan.  Furthermore, the music surrounding his lyrics/hymns falls very short of the groove that he once had.

The language used in the book is so simple that even Non-English speaking people fully understand  without difficulty what the writer wants to say. <br />I wish I had, thirty years ago, this book with me.I bought this book about 2 years back. I am trying to change my \\"financial life\\" in accordance with the principles set out in the book. I am confident about my success.

For all the exercise books and magazines that give you sample workout programs etc. etc. I find this book is far more useful in allowing me to identify and target specific muscle groups and work out a balanced program for myself. It's thorough, it's very clear and easy to use and strikes the perfect balance of usefulness for rank beginners and gym junkies. Every person I have shown this book to, has immediately bought themselves a copy, which says it all.
0316666343|3.0|\\"The Lovely Bones\\" by Alice Sebold holds the promise of an exciting and creative premise. Teenager Susie Salmon has been raped and murdered in the field near her home in the 1970s, and she is telling us her story from heaven, as she watches the world go on below her. The premise is fascinating and the first 100 pages or so offer a new possible insight into such crimes and such deaths, the idea that Susie has to let go of life as those alive must let go of her is strangely comforting as well as pitch perfect.<br />But as the story went on, I became disappointed and thought some of that promise was not fulfilled. As my friend Sarah said, \\"It's a big responsibility to write about life in heaven.\\" I felt to an extent that Sebold didn't hold up her end of the bargain. Some of the story lines seemed a little too neat or trite, and sometimes pretty unbelievable. The attraction of the book and its beginning are compelling because one wants to believe (and is willing to suspend one's disbelief over exactly what heaven might be like), but some of the plot lines came too easily, and some of the promises of the opening, I believed, were not fulfilled. Susie's letting go of her family, seemed to happen very suddenly, and without adequate focus leading up to it.<br />But even with that complaint, I recommend the novel. Some of the main points are in no way predictable, and what it gives one to consider is meaningful, even if you quibble with plot points.
B000069KGM|5.0|Those who are familiar with Chicago of the 1980s and beyond will likely not know the original incarnation of Chicago at all.  This music in 1969 was fresh, original, and, looking back, very progressive.  At the time the music was called by some a jazz-rock fusion, which the booklet included with the album explains was a marketing move.  Today we know such music in all its incarnations as progressive rock.<br />An amazing six of the twelve tracks from this CD were released as singles during the three years the album was on the Billboard top 100.  Of the six, five had to be edited because of their excessive length.  In those days, when FM was considered somewhat \\"underground\\" because of the paucity of FM stations and receivers, FM was the only place to hear these cuts in their unedited entirety.<br />Ardent fans of Chicago will recognize most if not all these hits by their titles:  \\"Does Anybody Really Know What Time It Is?\\", \\"Beginnings\\", \\"Questions 67 and 68\\", \\"Listen\\", \\"Poem 58\\", and \\"I'm a Man\\".  I admit that while I recognize most of these songs when I hear them, the titles often do not match well to the lyrics.  Even casual fans of Chicago would likely recognize most of these songs from the airplay they received in the late 60s and early 70s, and the airplay they continue to receive on classic rock stations.<br />Some of the songs in their unedited album versions are unfamiliar.  The extensive piano introduction to \\"Does Anybody Really Know What Time It Is?\\" gives the song an even stronger jazz influence than the song proper.  \\"Beginnings\\" starts out like the version released for radio, but it is nearly eight minutes long on the CD, adding an extended instrumental exit that adds jazz and Hispanic elements.<br />While the term jazz-rock does seem to classify much of this music, this first effort was experimenting with a variety of genres.  \\"Free Form Guitar\\" uses heavy feedback in a style strongly reminiscent of Jimmy Hendrix.  Music such as \\"Free Form Guitar\\" make \\"Chicago Transit Authority\\" as experimental in some ways as the contemporary \\"In the Court of the Crimson King\\" by King Crimson, considered one of the key milestones in progressive rock.<br />The last selection on this CD, \\"Liberation\\", has riffs that feel like some of the heavier music of the 60s, and manages to be sufficiently free-form that you might wonder whether this recording was the first time this music was played in exactly this way.  While there is a jazz influence in this song, it is a very psychedelic rock song.<br />The music here in a way is all over the map, from pop influenced songs like \\"Does Anybody Really Know What Time It Is\\" to the bizarre guitar instrumental of \\"Free Form Guitar\\".  Every cut shows the breadth of talent and ability of a group that should be considered progressive in its first incarnation.  Even the pop influenced songs generally have only pop portions, with incredible layered instrumentals surrounding the pop portions.  Absolutely phenomenal ground-breaking rock music, a must-have for any fan of progressive rock and cutting edge music of all eras.ke \\"Chicago Transit Authority\\" as experimental in some ways as the contemporary \\"In the Court of the Crimson King\\" by King Crimson, considered one of the key milestones in progressive rock.<br />The last selection on this CD, \\"Liberation\\", has riffs that feel like some of the heavier music of the 60s, and manages to be sufficiently free-form that you might wonder whether this recording was the first time this music was played in exactly this way.

B00008PW3Q|4.0|It was well worth the wait. Fleetwood Mac is back with an incredible album. True, it is a tad long, but the gems sparkle like diamonds. I have to say that Lindsey Buckingham brings out the best is Stevie Nicks' songs. She sounds more aggressive and adventurous than ever. 'Everybody Finds Out' is incredible, and the closing track, 'Goodbye Baby' is haunting. That being said, when Lindsey is by himself, he veers off track. Stevie keeps him reeled in a bit. They will always sound the best when they are together...<br />Randy
B00006L7XQ|4.0|I picked up Folsom Prison a few months back on vinyl and really dig it.  I have country in my blood but until recently have been ashamed of feeling it.   I picked up American IV after listening to a friends copy.  Originally I was turned off by all the covers and I still think he relies too heavily on the re-hashes.  However his renditions of Hurt and Bridge Over Troubled Water work really well.   Yet as a blossoming fan of his songwriting I wish he would of penned more.  The title track is great and a few more like it would of fleshed out the theme of the album.  Ditch Danny Boy and in my book any Beatles cover is a no-no (that's what cover bands are for).  Tracks such as these just take away from Cash's authenticity which is frustrating because he is one of the genuine talents of the music industry.  Regardless his voice while fragile with age still has the charm to hold you in it's embrace.
B000050FEN|3.0|Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt are cops on the prowl for a serial killer who chooses his victims from the &quot;Se7en&quot; deadly sins.  Much has been written to both bally-hoo and criticize this disturbing thriller.  In point of fact, there's not much to the story but hey, style goes a long, long way and this movie has style down pat.  There's something unsettling in the dreary, dark and haunted cinematography that makes even a public library or police station seem like the most frightening place on earth to be.  The chemistry between Freeman and Pitt is highly toxic.  Gwenyth Paltrow and Kevin Spacey costar. <BR>Unfortunately, for those who have been waiting to toss out their old flipper disc of this movie, I wouldn't be rushing out to the resale shop just yet.  Although there are definite advantages to not having to turn over your disc in the middle of the movie, this new edition of &quot;Se7en&quot; still suffers from a host of DVD mastering problems.  First there is edge enhancement to contend with.  At times it is nonexistant.  Then suddenly, there it is, excessive and distracting and making a mess out of the visual information presented on the screen.  Aliasing and shimmering of fine details also do this hit and miss throughout the movie.  A real shame since color rendering, shadow delineation and fine details throughout this disc are superbly rendered. Remember that this is an extremely dark visual experience.  The DVD's ability to retain depth and clarity throughout is remarkable.  The soundtrack is remastered in 5.1 and wonderfully vibrant in all of its sustained and low key ambiance.  <BR>Extras: An audio commentary and some toss away features that really don't enhance the over all viewing experience.  Really, they're not worth discussing. <BR>BOTTOM LINE: Better than the first try.  Third time's the charm!

B00003CX8V|2.0|Legendary director, Billy Wilder?s &quot;The Apartment&quot; is one of those little jabs of tawdry pleasure that crop up every once in a while. It?s the tale of an overworked office jockey, C.C. Baxter (Jack Lemmon) who wants so desperately to gain access to the executive suite that he starts renting out his apartment to company executives that are having affairs with their secretaries. Baxter?s shy repartee with elevator operator, Fran Kubelik (Shirley MacLaine) seems promising enough for an office romance of his own. That is, until Baxter learns that Fran is in love with his boss, Jeff Sheldrake (Fred MacMurray). However, when Fran accepts that her affair with Jeff can go nowhere because he refuses to divorce his wife, she begins to realize her night in shining armor might not come with a key to the executive washroom, but is genuine and good for her nevertheless.  <br />MGM DVD has done a below average job of remastering this DVD. The 2:35:1 anamorphic picture exhibits overly harsh, digital characteristics that are wholly unflattering. Though the gray scale is well balanced, offering fine detail, there are excessive amounts of shimmering, edge enhancement and aliasing throughout. Shadow delineation and contrast levels during the night scenes are poorly rendered. The soundtrack is mono and strident. There are no extras.
B00008PW3Q|4.0|Like Tusk, this album grows on you the more you listen.  Definitely a grab bag, and sometimes it does sound like Lindsey and Stevie solo projects merged together, but I think it sounds like more of a group effort than Tango In The Night did.  Christine's sunny, simple songs and sound are missing, true, but it still sounds like a true (although post-1977) Mac album. A friend who is not a Mac fan said of \\"Peacekeeper\\" - \\"I wasn't expecting such a good song from a dinosaur band,\\" and I think that is a good description of the album.  <BR>To me it's a nice merge of the 70's and 80's Mac.  You've got your slow churners (\\"What's the World Coming To\\", \\"Steal Your Heart Away\\", \\"Thrown Down\\", \\"Bleed To Love Her\\" and the sure-to-be-single \\"Say You Will\\") and your experimental Lindsey stuff (reminiscent to me of Go Insane) like \\"Murrow Turning Over In His Grave\\", \\"Red Rover\\" and \\"Come\\".  Lindsey's \\"Miranda\\" and Stevie's \\"Running Through The Garden\\" and \\"Everybody Finds Out\\" have a great 80's new-wave sound.  Stevie's \\"Illume\\" is one of my favorites, it's got a whirling, surging sound a la \\"Trouble in Shangri La.\\"  Lindsey really pushes her for some great vocals.  The two closing songs seem to be Lindsey and Stevie finding closure in their relationship, with my favorite being Stevie's album-closing ballad.  While her vocal on \\"Goodbye Baby\\" starts off very whispy, her voice builds into the refrain and it's a beautiful song, made even more special by Lindsey's slightly off-kilter time signature. <BR>While some folks complain about the length, I've found that I can make a couple of mixes from the CD, emphasizing my favorites, or up-tempo songs, or the best pop-py songs.  Favorites for me are \\"Illume\\", \\"Thrown Down\\", \\"Miranda\\", \\"Say You Will\\", \\"Peacekeeper\\", \\"Running Through the Garden\\", \\"Goodbye Baby\\".  Not on my list of favorites are \\"Come\\", \\"Silver Girl\\", \\"Destiny Rules.\\"<BR>I would recommend that anyone purchasing this album listen to it several times - it really does grow on you - then program in your favorites.  Like Tusk, when you're tired of your favorites, you'll have a whole other CD to rediscover.
B00005N5S5|3.0|Arnold Schwartnegger was a little known bodybuilder from Graz Austria when director, James Cameron decided to cast him in the role of the cyborg killing machine, &quot;The Terminator&quot;.  Yes, Arnie had already won multiple Mr. Olympias and starred in &quot;Pumping Iron&quot; and the original &quot;Conan&quot; movies.  But nothing put him over the top like this sci-fi thriller.  <BR>MGM gives us a much improved rendering of this movie on DVD.  The original release had been marred by excessively grainy images, soft details and some major color bleeding.  In this new incarnation (reportedly master in hi-def)we get a smoother looking print that is still soft. Shadow delineation can be well represented at times and generally weak at others. Ditto on the contrast levels, particularly in the dimly lit night club scene. But the excessive edge enhancement and shimmering fine details present on the original DVD are completely gone on this remastered special edition.  One fine note for the younger generation tuning into this movie for the first time.  The special effects have dated considerably.  These were the days before computer generated graphics.  Although every attempt has been made to clean up and slightly retouch the original film effects, they do not hold up to what is being offered up today.  I rather like that.<BR>The soundtrack of this DVD has been remastered to 5.1.  It's incredibly dated but well represented nonetheless.  <BR>EXTRA FEATURES: We get the original documentary on the making of this movie as well as the superbly realized retrospective with interviews from all of the principle players.  There's also an audio commentary and some stills and a theatrical trailer.  <BR>BOTTOM LINE: A marked improvement over the original DVD release but this version still leaves something to be desired.
B00006AW2G|5.0|First things first: the remastering on this is INCREDIBLE.  If you already own a copy from the '86 version of the CD, it is well worth considering upgrading.  The clarity and the improvement speaks for itself.  And it deserves to be heard at its' sonic best: after all, it's among the best rock albums of all time.<br />Ax the final album the Stones recorded before the tragedy at Altamont, this is the last time Jagger allows the lyrics to reveal as much menace as Keith's guitars.  Jagger takes on the persona so sleazy it takes on a weird appeal (Live With Me, Let It Bleed), someone with a messiah complex (Monkey Man), a serial murderer (Midnight Rambler) and the sole voice raging against an impending apocalypse (Gimme Shelter).<br />Playing the bulk of the guitar (along with a significant portion of the bass), Keith came into his own with this album - rediscovering the possibilities of his instrument (thanks to Ry Cooder's lessons with open tunings) and in the process discovering his bands' true niche - as ever playing the gamut of popular music, but never before making it sound so AUTHENTIC.  Rock, blues, country, funk, gospel - it's all here.<br />Let It Bleed - along with its' predecessor Beggars Banquet (and it's worth noting a great deal of the material from each album was developed simultaneously) - stands as the Stones greatest, most focused moments.  Not many bands could have lyrics like \\"I'm a cold Italian pizza/I could use a lemon squeezer\\" and \\"Rape, mureder/It's just a shot away\\" on the same album, and still make it sound so cohesive.<br />It's a great, peerless album.  If it were to come out today it would still sound a fresh and vital as ever.  I can't think of a higher recommendation that that.
6305358613|4.0|I saw this movie in the theater by myself because who else is interested in Tudor History, right?  Well, it was their loss. This film pulls you in from beginning to end.  Cate Blanchett at Elizabeth I is simply ingenius casting.  Elizabeth has been portrayed in so many other films by marvelous actresses in their later years that we seem to have a picture of a rather stiff and cartoonish type monarch when we think of Elizabeth.  Cate dispels this image from the start.  The story begins prior to Elizabeth's accession to the throne and the harsh treatment she bore from her sister Mary.  As Elizabeth's mother, Anne Boleyn, caused the banishment of Mary and her mother Catherine of Aragon, it is easy to see why Mary feels threatened by this young girl.  Elizabeth barely makes it through the later years of Mary's reign with her head.  <br />Joseph Fiennes does a marvelous job of playing Robert Dudley.  The Queen's Master of the Horse, and as many historians believe, her lover.  The love story is entertainingly expanded upon as well as the various plots against Elizabeth's life by catholic followers.  Elizabeth's flirting way of holding her privy counsel at bay on the issue of marriage are in excellent evidence here.  She bravely proclaims \\"There will be one Mistress here and NO Master!\\"  The fifth star is only withheld here for historical innaccuracy, but it in no way hampers the flow or entertainment value of this lavish and lovely film.  Cate deserved the Academy Award for this.  Her performance far surpasses Gwyneth Paltrow's in Shakespeare in Love, which is who she lost to that year.  Her performance, in a role that has been played by some of the greats, is both fearless and vulnerable all at the same time.

PO-
B00005V3Z4|5.0|This movie is great... extremely funny, very wierd... not at all the movie I would think it might be from looking at the box.  It seems to make only slightly more sense the second time you watch it, and not much more after subsequent viewings, but that doesn't detract from its excellence.  I could watch it about a million and a half times.  Most of the deleted scenes are a little boring, but some of them shed some light on the film.  I wish the director and actor commentary did a slightly better job of explaining some confusing points, but no matter.  The movie is still worth owning.

0060934913|4.0|If Tony Bourdain worked in another business riskier than cooking, he'd probably be in a witness protection program. In these memoirs the chef/writer tells it all-- I mean IT all about the profession. In his words we can see revaled the darkest secrets of the backstage of either a big restaurant or a small and obscure pub around the corner.<br />Bourdain has no time for futilities he goes to the botton line. He tells what you can or cannot eat when out in a restaurant. Moreover, he shows there is no glamour when it comes to be a chef. Forget that fancy thing we see in movies, in which chefs look more like poets. Yes, you will have to carry heavy things, you will get dirty, and you'll barely have time to eat. Bourdain's book is highly recommend not only for food aficionados, but also for any good reader.

B00005N83M|2.0|I don't know Jennifer personally.  She may be a great girl.    But honestly, if she writes one more song about how real she is, or how she is the same old 'Jenny from the block',' I swear I will [*insert harsh expressive term here*]  It gets old so fast.  I am surprised her label isn't telling her the same thing.  There's another wildly popular girl singing the same songs over and over again, and she's been relegated to the pre-teen set (and to that of older guys who get no booty).  If this keeps up, we'll see that happen to Ms. Lopez sooner than we think.  The best thing I can say is at least she hasn't gone the way of Ms. Carey...    Jenny, hon, as much as we all love hip-hop (I was raised on it, so I'm not hatin'), try something new, or stick to the big screen.    P.S.  It's true, she does sound perfect with Ja Rule.  But then, I've never heard a true hip-hop fan say anything good about Ja Rule...
B00000099Y|5.0|nima is technically superior to Undertow, however if you're more into riffs, fast music and stuff that you can really go off to... it's not as good. I personally like it better but i know others who don't. Adam Jones is one of the most creative guitarists around and the riffs he writes are awesome. This accompanyed by the amazing drumming by Carey and versatile voice of MJK makes any song they do great. The lyrics of this album have a lot more depth to them. Some people argue that they're scary but personally I believe they're just challenging ie they make you think. Tool ROCK!!
0195067142|5.0|\\"With the Old Breed\\" is a first-hand account of combat against the Japanese at Okinawa and Peleliu. Actually, I never heard of the Battle for Peleliu until I read this book. But, this battle and the one for Okinawa were fierce battles against an enemy very willing to die for their cause. Very few prisoner were taken.<br />Overall, I thought this book was excellent. Lying in foxholes at night waiting for the Japanese to infiltrate must have been horrific as was the constant shelling. There was 2 weeks of rain on Okinawa and mud and trench foot, etc. And then there was the stench of rotting bodies. The most memorable moment in the book for me was when the author was ordered to dig in along a ridge. First, he found maggots. After more digging, he realized he was digging through a dead Japanese soldier!
0385507755|5.0|After having read James Frey's debut novel, my answer is an unequivocal and resounding yes.  <br />I cannot remember a book evoking such a wide variety of emotions from me.  Horror and shock at the damage and visceral accounting of the author's self-destruction; awe at Frey's shockingly honest and unfiltered description of himself and the path which led him to his crossroads; gut wrenching sadness at the shattered lives of the characters and pride and joy at the truth that free-will, friendship, integrity and love can liberate even the most self-destructive of people.<br />Through \\"A Million Little Pieces\\" Frey allows us to see a human being at his absolute worst and 200 pages later at his best.  Driving home the themes of self-accountability, integrity, honesty, friendship, love and free will through his journey, Frey brings the reader along with electric dialog, hearty laughter and tearful moments of both pain and joy.  <br />A writer for a generation... I hope so.
