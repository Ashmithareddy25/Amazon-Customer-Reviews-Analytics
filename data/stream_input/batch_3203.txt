B00DQQSD3G|1.0|This review is for the &#34;enhanced&#34; edition. The quality is absolutely awful on all 3 of these editions. If you're looking to purchase. DO NOT get the kindle editions and buy the iBook editions. They use 720p HD video, as opposed to the standard definition video on the kindle which has been severely compressed. Also compressed are the picture files which look awful on the higher definition kindle.<br />To compare, the kindle edition is approximately 1/4 the size of the iBook edition. If you care about the visual quality of this release. then get it from iTunes.<br />Amazon overly-compresses ALL of their &#34;enhanced edition&#34; books and this practice needs to stop.
B005KCGIUY|5.0|Took a little long to arrive (thanks holidays) but well worth the wait & surpasses (only in my humble opinion) previous releases.  My favorite track being &#34;Ocean&#34; but truly all the tracks stand out on their own.

B000I8G5GW|5.0|A great movie. I had to return to this movie. It was a favorite of mine.  The theme song is haunting and the plot was very good. One of the top World War II movies.

B0094BB4TW|5.0|Facebook has brought me close to my extended family and friends.  I see them every day. Love It all seasons
B004G6009U|5.0|My daughter loves this movie. I can't say that you would go wrong buying it for your child. Good movie
1593272790|5.0|Got this for my grandson's 10th birthday. he loves it and has used it often. Very creative ideas. Better than video games.
B00013M6NK|2.0|Loved it initially. After a few weeks it won't stay connected to the phone.  If connected by me holding it together tightly, it doesn't charge anymore
0307887448|5.0|It's been a while since I picked up a book and devoured it.<br /><br />The characters, setting and story of this book won me over quickly and kept me engaged. If anything, I want more from this universe.
B00908DDZM|4.0|Unlike most CD's today, that has 2 hit songs that are awesome and everything else is ok to bad, I really like this whole CD and I love 4 songs.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|Great companion for the console version. Also helps to unlock alternate costumes in the console version as well..Great game all around.
B007FH9GT2|5.0|Smart movie.  Didn't read the book, but I really love the plot.  Great acting, great drama.  Just an overall Awesome movie!
B0093LINT2|4.0|I am using this device as a media center and it is very, very fast. mSata of 32GB (Ubuntu just use 5GB), 8GB of RAM and a Logitech Wireless Touch Keyboard K400.<br />The bad? It is true it doesnt bring the power cable (the mickey mouse or cloverleaf power cable) and the MSata drives are still expensive. But this little machine rocks!
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Adele's voice is so good.  I listen to this CD more often than any other CD I have ever owned.  Not a huge fan of tracks 1-2 but there are still ok.  Love 3 and beyond.<br /><br />Whoever broke her heart I thank them because it caused her to produce such good music, its crazy.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I love this game. The game is worth the time it takes to play. I am not the best at it but with a little practice I have learned to love the game.
B001R0LOES|5.0|movie about an Irish freedom fighter staring Liam Neeson.  What else does a man need in life?  Instead of his daughter being taken his freedom was.  So what does he do?  He kills everyone!
0375826742|4.0|Good story. I thought there were only going to be three volumes to the set, so I was a bit surprised. But it was fine once I got into it. I had read the first two books before this was released.
B003F3NDWG|5.0|I am a huge Castle fan, I purchased all seasons and all books.  If you are a fan, this is for you
B003VANOFY|1.0|After 6 months it fails to charge and loses connection.  Poor engineering on the usb plug.  Loose and does not hold a charge very long.
1401324029|5.0|Huge fan.  Purchased all the seasons and books.  If you are not fan, give it a shot.  You just might turn into one
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|WONDERFUL book! I would definitely read it again and again. Great ending to an amazing, one of a kind trilogy.
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|Saw this online and I ordered this for my mom for christmas, she is going to love it!! Everything arrived on time and the condition of the product is fantastic!
B00FATEJYE|5.0|Well done... most epic game I've played do far.... you have to download it for yourself... plus it's free do why worry
B009UX2YAC|5.0|One time i played this game for 2 hours straight doing nothing else with no breaks. If that doesn't describe an awesome game than i don't know what is!
B004MC8CA2|1.0|Bible<br />Too hard to navagate. could not go from Chapter to chapterI I I Did not like the format.<br />Case Closed
B006UKFFE0|5.0|This book opened my eyes to one of the greatest startup tools I have yet to discover: the Lean Canvas. Coming from a manufacturing background with a slightly different take and appreciation of &#34;Lean&#34; it has taken some effort to organize my thoughts around the use of the Lean concept in startups. In fact, this idea of a MVP (minimal viable product) while common sense, is anything but common knowledge. This is a &#34;top ten&#34; must own and read [and re-read] book for anyone launching a business or the existing biz owner wanting to recapture the speed and passion of their days as a startup. Special thanks and shout out to 3DS (three day startup) for making this book a foundation for their hackathons.
B00EKR61FM|5.0|Beautifully put together pictorial in addition to providing the definitive Twilight experience. The additional material of Rob and Kristen interacting gave a glimpse of what they really like together.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|it made me realize how lucky I am to be whole, to be free. I am enlightened. amazing is an understatement.
B006LSZECO|1.0|Interesting story idea but nothing but whining characters. Hated them both. It would have been better if they had just killed each other before the book was written.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|Who is better than Columbo as a great detective, doesn't swear, need sunglasses or even carries a gun, and yet the &#34;bad guys&#34; always go willingly, as they know they have met there match....timeless entertainment if you enjoy mysteries~
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I've read a few of Grisham's books; some I liked better than others.  Sycamore Row is my favorite.  It is basically a terrific yarn with larger-than-life characters.  The Mississippi setting is authentic, very believable.<br /><br />The plot has enough twists and turns to keep the reader interested until the unexpected but satisfying ending.<br /><br />I'm glad to see John Grisham in such good form.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|This is a tough read for someone who is diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment, but excellent writing--read both of her more current ones on autism and left neglect--and clarity.  One gets a lot of information on tests and need for support group not only for caretakers but also those experiencing cognitive loss at such a rapid pace and genetic testing component.  Our book club was particularly biased against the husband, but Alzheimers has many victims and coping mechanisms and I didn't see him the way others did.  Strong characters in the family and doctors.
B002M9FWQE|5.0|Mika is the best. I love the vocal range, and singing along.  Even as a boy it is a lot of fun, and unlike hairband rock and metal, lyrics are very whimsical.  The first two albums (this one and 'life in cartoon motion') seem like they belong together in a box set. Definitely goes along with scissor sisters.
B006LSZECO|4.0|A book where you hate almost all of the characters, the story is about a psychopathic mind that is unbelievable, but no sympathy for her victims who aren't as ill and murderous, but still imperfect.  I think more importantly it shows us the negative side of our news media and how quickly they sway public opinion, often times to wrong conclusions.  our defense attorneys and ways they manipulate juries and media is despicable, and that if you can afford to hire the &#34;best&#34; you may just get your moneys worth.  From the parents who spawned this psychopath and wrote the Amazing Amy books that made their daughter always judged and always playing a role to be who others wanted or she thought they wanted her to be, it may also bring up questions of nature/nurture similar to a Defending Jacob.  The author is gifted in coming up with this constantly twisting mystery and making the reader turn page after page.  Something is wrong that you are happy when grifters rob Amy--have I been taken in by this cynical look at what the economic times have done to the man's inhumanity towards man.  The fact that she gets away with murder and the couple that deserves each other are about to become parents is disturbing.
B00ESZZOCM|4.0|After making do with a region 2 dvd (cropped image; no extras), I was surprised and relieved to see Saturn 3 finally getting a release 33 years after its theatrical run. Shout! Factory has come out with what is certainly the best release of Saturn 3 ever. This set includes two discs- one blu ray, one dvd. The blu ray image is excellent and sharp (Farrah and Hector look great; beautiful, eerie quasi-futuristic corridors of the moonbase), in widescreen with excellent sound, nicely balancing Hector's creepy sounds and Elmer Bernstein's odd, electronic/symphonic score. The blu ray extras are generous, including an interview with the English actor who dubbed Harvey Kietel's part in the film, an extended `blue dreamers' scene, and added scenes/bits from the network televised version of the film (though they're not of high quality). The commentary, though from fans of the film (Greg Moss of the Saturn 4 Fan Page; film critic David Bradley) as opposed to cast/crew directly involved with the film production, is informative (they certainly did their homework) and answers some questions I had about this troubled production (which Kirk Douglas made no mention of in his autobiography). There's also an interview with Colin Chilvers (who should have been on the commentary) concerning special effects and other matters(great robotic FX, admittedly so-so spaceship sequences; cast tensions).<br /><br />Granted, some of the effects and dialogue may make more contemporary/CGI-savvy audiences cringe and scoff, but this may be a cult film for certain generations who watched it (or wanted to) back in 1980. Nothing seems to be missing here (compared to my old region 2 disc). All those hokey moments- three characters arguing over 'shared sex' ideas from terrible old Earth, spaceships flying through meteor-showered rings of Saturn (picture 'bread balls underwater'), all kinds of creepy and nasty things occur with the big, clumsy, tube-tied android Hector at its center, are on display, lookingbetter than ever. Kirk Douglas is great as usual, Farrah is lovely but seemingly ditzy, and Harvey Keitel is creepy but not quite himself due to a robotic performance and dubbing. But...DO get hold of this sadly, nearly-forgotten semi-sexy sci-fi/horror flick and appreciate something you may have been too young to see at the time (as I had been). Loosen up and enjoy it- don't take it seriously!
B00ESJICMC|5.0|Love his music and enjoy each one of his songs on this new cd. Have all of his previous ones also.
0525953728|5.0|I must read book for anyone who is interested in the truth and what these men go threw in day to day life.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|Wow, my husband and I were PLEASANTLY surprised at this tv series.  It was a bit depressing in parts but full of action and humor sprinkled throughout.  It is well written and directed. You find yourself thinking about morality and &#34;what would you do&#34; in the different scenarios. You are mad at the characters one minute and sympathetic the next minute.  Just as a FYI for those concerned, it does have cursing and is a bit dark but it is definitely worth checking out if you don't mind that.  A++++++
0307887960|2.0|I tried this diet and nearly ended up in the emergency room! I was on it for about a week, and each day got sick to my stomach. I don't have a gallbladder, and have a thyroid problem. I don't know if that's what came into play, but I was left so weak and sick to my stomach, I nearly fainted from the continuous stomach - dehydrated and like I wasn't even eating.<br /><br />I got off of it (I'd lost literally around 10 pounds) ... and had to start eating carbs again. I have a friend who did this diet successfully, but for some reason my body couldn't handle it?<br /><br />I's not for everyone, and be careful!
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|This is a good game to play. I have only been playing this game a couple days so I have a lot to do.
B00FWLDHSY|5.0|Why can't all action/sci-Fi movies be this good!!! If you liked Independence Day you'll LOVE THIS one!  Great movie, great cast, great action!!!!
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|What a ride!  For the time I read this book I was wistful about the Land of Ago.  I couldn't wait to go back with Jake every time. I loved it. I loved the characters, the suspense, the love story, and Jake the good guy.  I was lost in the story, I did not want for it to end.  I was completely lost in the time and the story and the characters. The time the people, they came alive.  What more could you want in a good book!  Loved lt!  Thanks for writing it!
B00BSBR9N6|4.0|The Rosie Project described the man's heart's desire...until he realized what he really needed!  This is the most humorous book to come into my hands in years. Funny, feel-good, wonderful!
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Only issue I have is the loading time but great game after all. Control, visuals, rewarding, advancement, and most of all, fun. This is the best way to live as a shark in their world.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|So far i really like this game. It is interesting. I like the characters and the story line. It is an interesting and fun game.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|The Epilogue was disappointing and was a slight undoing of the pacing and intensity of the novel. There were minor unrealistic parts, but overall the story keeps you reading.
B007EE4XKI|1.0|I usually like ST:TNG books so I bought all three in this series. bad mistake. I could barely manage to read one third of this 1st one before I gave up. I haven't been desperate enough since to go back to try again. Perhaps if I do I'll update this review.
B0085HWZ9Y|5.0|If you are a fan, you will love this Band of Joy. I am biased because I love all things Robert.
B0091W0JPE|5.0|This is a classic! Was a request from a friend, haven't seen it in a long time, enjoyed revisiting it!
0553801473|5.0|Love the on-going saga, the rich drama and character development.  I hated the tragic ending.  I am hoping for a book 6 to see happens to Arya and Dani.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|Tons of new content and enhanced gameplay from the original. The new social links and cinematics alone make this game a worthy buy!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I have read Grisham novels years ago and very few I loved it. But I got this book for very acceptable price, reviews are very good so I tried it. Im'm not sorry. This is very good, readable book with a good story line and tense ending (last 10 percent).<br />I never read A Time To Kill, just watched movie, but now I'll give it a try.
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|Full disclaimer - I'm a huge Sanderson fan. The Mistborn trilogy is hands down my favorite fantasy series. I've read a few others of Sanderson's work and have loved some, and could do without others. About 30 pages into this book, I was a little disappointed. Based on my experience with Sanderson, I thought the storyline was basically a repeat of some other, Warbreaker-type plots, in a new setting. However, I plugged through, and I was duly rewarded. The story is fast-paced and engaging, and in the end, there were enough mysteries to keep me guessing even if I thought I had it figured out (spoiler, I didn't). I loved this book and highly recommend it, even to the non-fantasy crowd. I would love to see it become a movie.
B002ZDOXLW|5.0|This album brings out the range and richness of Loreena's voice.  The music is a blend of various ancient cultures and conveys the mystery and magic of those cultures that soothes and delights me.  Of equal quality is her album &#34;Mask and Mirror&#34;.
1476727651|5.0|Ranks right up there with It and The Shining as one of Stephen King's scariest books! Hard to put down!
B00F7YHDWC|1.0|This is just not my type of game.  I like more action.  It is a dumb way to die.  I never did get the hang of it.
B00D2ZF3GQ|2.0|Not up to the quality of a typical Will Smith movie. I'm generally a fan of his movies. Hopefully, his next will be better.
B00EODUWQ6|2.0|Not so much enlightening as predictable such as a circle is. Drags on. The obvious comparisons to FB etc is somewhat telling but does not make allowances for major doubt that would exist
B008JFUPK8|5.0|Very good movie. Hopefully, there is a sequel of equal or better viewing pleasure. A job well done by all involved.
B00ACBN9CI|5.0|Thank you for the upgrades. Third wire continues to improve all 3 games in the franchise. Best games of this genre I have ever come across &quot;at any price&quot; still surprises me that it's free I would gladly pay for it.
B00E4W40C4|5.0|It ranks up there with the rest of the Xmen movies. I'm a big fan. Noone else could come close to owning the role of Wolverine. One of the best features of this story is keeping Hugh Jackman as the Wolverine. Hope this series keeps going.
B000VMBXNA|5.0|A refreshing little book that gives insight into how isolating being a royal can be.  Clear, simply written and very interesting.
B00CL0J99K|5.0|Another must see.... Robert Downy Jr. is at the top of his game right now. I'm curiuos to see if there is more Iron Man in the future.
B005S9EKCW|4.0|One of my new favorite films. Really good acting, and even if sometimes the singing can be alittle difficult to listen to, it was still beautifully done.
B0087FMUCQ|4.0|I love this game. Beautiful scenery and great physics. I'd give it 5 stars if you could quit the app completely. I know there's no security risk, no spyware or bots but a battery drain. If the developer can fix this I'll add the extra star. Thanks for the awesome game.
B00BHBO3LI|5.0|As always Doctor Who does it all the time.  It was  great adventure and exciting to watch.  The situation he gets into is something.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|This is one of the funniest games on kindle tablet<br />The concept is great and it help unlock thing on console version
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I, like the author, stayed away from most stories, movies etc., the past events of slavery  encompassed. I could not put down this book! I cried  a lot, but just had to read on as though reading their story gave the slaves in this book a voice. A voice that needs to be heard by all.
B00CSCJ09K|5.0|Yet again, David Garrett gives us rock and classic violin, backed by an incredible orchestra of electic guitar and symphonic instruments.  With interpretations of Cold Play and Beethoven, he plays his favorites and makes new ones for us to treasure.  David also introduces us to some artists who might be less well known here, but are famous (and rightly so) in their own countries.  If you like to get your classical music with a modern flair, any one of David's recent CDs will, do, and this one leads the way.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I love the game but the update i want is not out yet and it was supposed to 1 week ago. So I'm not gonna play the game no more until the update i want comes out.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game has the potential to take over my evenings. The only drawback is that I can't make this my full time job.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|I really like this app it is super fun and has so many cool characters you get to be I need to get the game for ps 3
B00003JRCQ|2.0|Somehow I was bored by it. I ordered it together with &#34;Pride and Prejudice&#34; which I really like a lot.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Awesome book, the author is great at painting a perfect picture about what is going on. I loved reading this and I'm 26, I think it would be good for younger people to read also.
B00FKAA3MA|5.0|Some of Eminem's best work in recent memory. Excellent production and a song type for several kinds of listeners ranging from hardcore hip hop to pop.
B000002LSV|4.0|For my husband.  Brings back alot of memories.  Great gift.  Great packaging.<br />Alot of their hit songs.  Sounds wonderful<br />Would buy again.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This app is amazing. It's great not just for passing the time but for everyday use too. There's so many games to play and unlock. Plus there's instructions for each game. Also when I updated it I didn't lose anything. I love this game so much and recommend it to all ages.
B004XGN8W4|3.0|I purchased the G155 system for my son for Christmas Dec 2011 on amazon.com.<br />A year later it stopped working.

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I like the katniss character very much. She inspired me and in a couple ways is just like me. She was reckless at times like me and confused. The series was soo good I wished you would make another book just because. I loved the series and the last book was a stunner. Can't wait for the last movie!!
B00A7CI82I|2.0|I am a huge fan of the Bourne movies, but this was a huge disappointment. Without going into spoilers, I can say that the plot was silly and it bore little to no resemblance to the previous three films, which are some of the best action movies ever made. The nicest thing I can say about it is that it had a good cast, but the script, the premise and the plot were way off.<br /><br />If you liked the first three, it's a safe bet you won't like the Bourne Legacy. I hope Hollywood will come to its senses and make a new Bourne movie with 100% more Matt Damon that starts by assuming this movie was never made.
B0009R243A|5.0|Billy Idol is fantastic. This album is nostalgic and makes me groove every time I listen to it. Saw him in concert recently, he still has got it.
B00DNB9RXO|5.0|I like it...  The graphics are cool and I like that there are unlimited lives (or its it &quot;lifes&quot; when the topic is video games? Anyway...)  Great game so far.  I hope to keep enjoying it.
B003KLSK2Q|5.0|Sade is so smooth. Her music is soothing and really great. I recommend having this selection for your collection. Great music.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I use the Weather Channel app everyday. I have family in other states, including Texas and Hawaii. It's a great way for me to check the local and national weather.
B000002H1T|4.0|The Cars were a hit in the 80's. This is one of their better cd's. A must for any cd collection.
B00009TB5G|5.0|I love this series but to get this set with the extended scenes was a bonus along with the nice box it goes in.
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|This game was rather entertaining. The graphics were well done and the controls were smooth and easy to use. The sorry was decent although kind of obvious shortly into the game but overall a great sag game
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I loved every page if this book. I would not have this book end any other way. Well done, great job!!!
B00000IQMT|5.0|.............need I say more? In The Phantom Menace, the music doesn't call for a more dramatic score (except during the lightsaber duels and certain battle scenes) which has an outstanding and memorable sound that sort of reminds me of something out of Greek mythology. For the most part, this soundtrack has a lot of passivity to it, which is a reflection of the many slow scenes in the movie. John Williams made the most out of what he had to work with, which I'm guessing was more challenging than episodes 4-6, which makes this score all that more impressive. While the movie is shaky at times, the soundtrack is solid, and John Williams doesn't deviate too much from the core sound of the Star Wars franchise. Instead, he makes a score that has an 'older' sound to it, thus reminding viewers that the first episode happens many years before the others. There's a tremendous emphasis on the Jedi, and establishing their presence through music. I recommend this stellar soundtrack for Star Wars fans, or those who are fans of John Williams and classical music.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|The tears just keep flowing! The bravery and love and selflessness is just amazing in this book-this series! I am absolutely in love with this series and this last book was breathtaking, the love just flows! I will definitely be reading this series over and over again!!! I recommend it to everyone! Tris and Tobias are AMAZING!
1781162646|3.0|The work is easy to digest, a short and fun read.  I gave it 3 out of 5 stars because Mr. King's plot is a bit tired.  The themes, plot devices, and characters he pulls out feel like cheaper versions of some of his better literary creations, all mashed together into a new story with a novel background.  To a long time King reader like myself, it felt like we were treading over some well worn trails, and I was personally hoping for something more......
B0050PYNP8|5.0|I just love this movie. Though I could have done without some of the language, it was good. I love Simon Peg.
B008MWBY6W|5.0|A fantastic bag that fully protects camera. The only concern is that it barely holds an extra lens but it is fantastic!
B00005ATQE|5.0|Great movie. Very emotional. I love it. I am a fan of pretty much every military movie out there and this one is definitely one of the top ones.
B00D48BT5A|4.0|Excellent book, well-written and a great story as Bryson always does. However, I did wonder where all the women of 1927 were.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|Enjoyable on kindle reminders to return to the game is nice. Very good graphics and music will recommend to friends.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|It had the feel of Harry Potter with a spirit quest tossed in. Huge symbolism in the setting and sweetness in the characters.
B00A6CCF0K|3.0|This book was a mixed bag for me. Loved the opening chapters, but got bogged down in the middle and ultimately bailed. Too many books to read and too little time and this one couldn't keep my attention. Since I didn't finish it, I will never know how things played out, but can live with that. Then again, the direction of the plot seemed pretty transparent.<br /><br />I still rated the book 3 stars. I liked picking up the threads from The Shining and when King is on -- as I think he was in many of the early chapters -- he's very, very good.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I am so happy we finally have some kind of castleville on kindle fire. Works great, no freezing. The only thing better would be if it was the actual castleville from Facebook!
B000FC2KL0|5.0|Been a longtime fan but have always been I the fringes of fandom. This brings me back to my childhood and jamming to blood sugar. All of the background stories are awesome. In my own maturities; I find the journey beyond the small pinnacles of the moment!
B00BAXFACO|5.0|I've read every book Connelly has written. This tops them all, the man just keeps getting better... Bravo. Can't wait for the next one.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Recommend this book.  Great plot, well drawn characters.  Easily could be made into a movie.  Matthew McGanahey would play Jake, of course!  Good historical insight into life in Clanton in the south in the 80's.  Haven't enjoyed such a good book in awhile.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|We use this to stream Netflix and YouTube to our HDTV, and it works beautifully.  The picture is crystal clear; I'm no expert but I'd say the picture and sound are around Blu Ray quality.  I'm really hoping that Google will get around to making it easier to &#34;cast&#34; (as they call it) your web browser onto your TV; my family and I would like to be able to watch TV shows directly from, say, CBS's or NBC's websites, but so far this feature doesn't work well at all.  The audio and video are too choppy to be enjoyable.  But even with that being the case, the Netflix and YouTube streaming work perfectly, and for such a small price the Chromecast is definitely worth it.
B00BKTWBMA|5.0|Great effort, I love the album.  The music flows nicely.  I am glad I bought the album, very relaxing melodies.
B005LJK3AC|5.0|My husband and I have watched this movie several times and think it's pretty funny.  This is my all time favorite role for Jennifer Aniston (not fond of her squeaky clean roles), and the guys are pretty funny too.
B004YAS9M8|4.0|I love listening to this CD and I love this music.  I will likely by other CDs of his, however, I think i prefer recordings of his live performances because the orchestra which accompanies many of his pieces is much more apparent than it is on this CD.
B000YAA68C|5.0|I had it sent to someone because it was her favorite. She treasures it and thanked me. Share the warmth.
B004EPZ0AM|4.0|It could use some more behind the scenes footage, but I understand that the target audience isn't necessarily interested in that stuff.  Otherwise, great movie, terrific soundtrack.

B005IQ39AY|4.0|Works  great on kindle fire,  is in slow motion on kindle fire hd and is glitchy on the kindle fire hdx.  The balls turn small and the game ends. Need to contact the developer
B00FATEJYE|3.0|Great companion for the console game. I wouldn't spend lot of time with this if it didn't help me unlock things over there. Well worth the fact it is free. The graphics are top notch, though.
B0091VTISO|5.0|If you like these kind of shows then you will like this one.....It holds true to the story line that is Conan but with a different flare. I recommend watching it, love the sword fighting that goes on in it. I enjoyed the action, and the scene layouts, the way it was all put together.
B00GLX1MG6|5.0|FUNNY! I wish there were 100 more types of this movie out there. Hasn't been one this off the wall funny since wedding crashers.

B00CDT41RY|5.0|Very gory. Great acting by Jamie Foxx, Leonardo Dicaprio and Christoph Waltz. The film angles made the scenes more powerful and overall this was an original, worthwhile revenge movie.
0316074314|5.0|This is one of the most engrossing novels I've ever read.  I was up late 3 nights in a row reading hundreds of pages in each sitting, only going to bed each night because I had to work the next day.  The plot is complex with lots of mysteries to solve, which makes it a very fun read.  In that regard, it reminds me of The Quincunx by Charles Palliser. As someone with a scientific view of the world, I was skeptical about the astrological aspects of this book, but that part of the book is easily ignored. There is also a supernatural phenomenon at the heart of the book which required me to suspend my disbelief; but that was ok for me and no worse than believing in faster than light travel in star trek or in magic in The Lord of the Rings.  I'm really glad I read more reviews after reading Janet Maslin's negative review in hte New York Times.  After reading her review, I almost cancelled my order.  Fortunately, other reviewers including Bill Rohrbach of the Times understood and appreciated The Luminaries much more than Maslin did.
B00EY8BRGU|3.0|Interesting movie like you were at a magic show for two hours and got to see behind the scenes. I loved it until the twist which I found many gaps in. Was left thinking…..huh? Could have been amazing why'd they do that?
B002JVWQT6|5.0|I got on the Modern Family bandwagon a little late and missed the first two seasons.  This blu-ray is great.  The picture and sound are sharp, and I love how most blu-rays will remember where you left off and start from there.  While most shows take a little time to build up steam, this show is funny from the start.  My wife, who told me she didn't like the show, has been laughing non-stop and now will admit she &#34;kinda likes it&#34;.  (She's stubborn--I know she loves it).
B00CWV8TIU|5.0|I didn't personally watch this, but family ordered off of our app tv from the amazon app and they all loved it! They were ages 32-61.

B00DF0POXA|2.0|This album says to me, I am not happy with where I am in my life and this album will make me one step closer to fulfilling my contractual obligations to the record label.  I managed to buy this album for $2.99 from Amazon and now think that was $3.00 too much.  I could have given that money to a panhandler and been more fulfilled!
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|Both actors have a lot of energy in this movie. It's great and original and a complete mess-in a comical way.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|A fitting end although the writing is a bit pedestrian.<br />  It's easy to see where the final movie will focus.
B00F87ZUYG|3.0|I loved every past season of the walking dead…5+ and wanted this one to be great it just seemed redundant and slow moving. My husband and I just started loosing interest and canceled the season pass.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I saw the movie first, but that didn't spoil it.  Great book.  Can't wait to read the rest of the books!
B00C5R7B0I|4.0|This was the best Scarpetta novel in a long time.  The characters interacted more like they did in the early books, and there weren't too many outsiders to take attention away from them.  It doesn't mean that the book didn't have things that bothered me and red herrings that just filled up space, like the death of the psychiatrist.  Was he killed or was it just an auto accident?  And was it really necessary for Cornwell to have inserted Scarpetta into the real-life mass shooting at the Sandy Hook school in Newtown, CT?  Other than that, I found it much more enjoyable than the last few.<br /><br />Coincidentally, this is the third novel I've read in the past month about the FBI being either out of control or so controlling of their agents that you wonder how they manage to get anything done.  Food for thought....................
B00EGMQIJ0|3.0|An entertaining read.  Interesting ideas re tech invasion of our lives.  Not good literature--shallow characters, obvious insights. That's about it.

B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|This is a wonderful read. Not exactly a mystery but an unfolding courtroom drama that deals beautifully with issues of race and class in the American South.
B00ESH04LQ|4.0|I enjoyed seeing Jos Wheden's favorite actors in this movie. It made Shakespeare fun. I downloaded this to my Kindle for a long plane flight and it definitely kept my attention and actually made me laugh out loud! Not a good thing on a plane with over a hundred people. *grins*

B0097AQEOK|5.0|Joni Mitchell provided much of the sound track for my teens and twenties. Listening to her again, I find her as fresh and relevant now as I did then. It’s wonderful to get reacquainted with this old friend and marvel again at her trajectory from a mountain dulcimer strumming hippie goddess to a jazz peer of the great Charles Mingus.<br />  This collection, which covers her first 10 records, drives home just how amazing her contribution to modern song, culture, and music has been.<br />  I must have “met” Joni somewhere around “Ladies of the Canyon,” her third record.  Unfamiliar with her first two discs, I found it enlightening to listen to her simple, often melancholy tunes that reveal the roots of “future Joni” very clearly.  She was considered a folk artist at the time but her open guitar tunings and eerie vocal excursions move well beyond simple chord changes and song structures more associated with the movement.<br />  Some artifacts from the 60’s don’t hold up well over the years. Joni does. She never – okay, rarely—sound dated. Her deeply personal lyrics are as poetic, honest, wry, and insightful as her arrangements are rich. Her phrasing, tonality, and overall vocals are gorgeous.<br />  She has written anthems such as “Woodstock” and “Big Yellow Taxi” as well as modern jazz standards such as “Help Me.”<br />Joni has claimed to be first and foremost a painter—a fact revealed in much of the album art. She said something like she only sang and recorded that which she couldn’t paint. As her work proceeds from “Blue” and “For the Roses” through the increasingly jazzy “Court and Spark” to “Hissing of Summer Lawns” and beyond, her sonic landscapes are brought to life with amazing collaborators like Tom Scott’s L.A. Express, members of Weather Report, and some of the world’s top musicians. The resonant, open landscape of  “Hejira” still makes me long for an open stretch of highway. The collection culminates in “Mingus” where she secures a prominent place on the stage of the jazz pantheon.<br />  If you’re a Joni fan like me, or just checking her out for the first time, this collection is a great place to start. Listen to the discs in chronological order and ride along on her journey. I encourage you to watch some of her performances and interviews online and gain an appreciation for an artist who will stand the test of time and emerge as one of the great treasures of our era.tes in “Mingus” where she secures a prominent place on the stage of the jazz pantheon.<br />  If you’re a Joni fan like me, or just checking her out for the first time, this collection is a great place to start.

B005LW5J9O|3.0|Very interesting, however, excessive detail and minutiae, fringe related persons, etc.  Book could have been written in half the space and still gotten the important point across.

B008ZOHCKE|5.0|This app is one of the best things I've found yet. I have a Kindle Fire &amp; I always have it on me. This has been a life saver in class to take notes, as I can have a notebook for each of my different subjects &amp; then one for exam materials and others for vocab; this app is absolutely perfect.<br />It'd be better if there were more themes avaliable &amp; there were the chance to lock individual notebooks, but for the quality of the app (and the fact that the advertisements inconspicuous!), I can hardly complain.

B00FQ53NIA|1.0|&#34;There was a time I was one of a kind.&#34;<br /><br />That's true. There was a time Britney was the most special and beloved pop singer in the United States. Manufactured, safe, but still creative enough to not solely be a musical puppet. That time was 2003 with the release of her forth studio album In the Zone, which to date stands as her only real statement as an artist. This was also just before her complete mental breakdown and alleged drug use. I always said that I had to give Ms. Spears all the credit in the world for not committing suicide given just how cruel and malicious the media was to this woman who really did not deserve all the abuse she was receiving. I swear the media was nicer to George Zimmerman than it was to Britney Spears. Her crime? Well, I still haven't figured that out. And in a way, this time in her life both made her a stronger person, but also a complete shell of the pop singer she used to be. She's clearly lost a little of her equilibrium along the way, no longer singing and dancing as well as she once did. And what's evident is her lack of effort on every subsequent release. Blackout and Circus are, to date, her greatest records-- unfortunately, she had absolutely nothing to do with that. She wrote not a single line, her voice is auto-tuned and processed to the point where it transcended a human quality, and she looks half-asleep in all the promotional material. At least to me. But at the end of the day, those two records had some of the greatest songs of her entire career (Piece of Me, Gimme More, Circus, Radar, Shattered Glass).<br /><br />But the days of Britney getting all the best tracks seems to have come with a close, a trend first started with the one-single &#34;3&#34;, which commemerated a greatest hits package. What followed was the disaster that was Femme Fatale, a lukewarm, bland pop record void of any sort of personality or presence. I dare say it, the drunken party girl Britney person she used on Blackout and Circuswas at least interesting. For as hard as she tried to not try at all, Britney had transformed into the Courtney Love of pop princesses, and she was damn good at it. Femme Fatale was Britney's rebirth as a mature woman. But the songs were awful, none of them had any sort of hook, and the lyrics weren't even close to clever or sexy. I predicted it was the end of the road for Britney Spears, no matter how well or unwell the material would go on to chart. The album was a moderate success, its single overshadowing the final product as a whole-- this is perhaps the first time that had happened since her sophomore album Oops...I Did It Again. But the guilty pleasure fun that Spears provided me was missing, and I had to admit it, but I was disappointed.<br /><br />I struggle with whether or not I call myself a Britney fan. She's everything I dislike in an artist: she's not particularly talented; she can't supplement her lack of talent with personality; she hasn't evolved since for about six years now; she lip-syncs on stage; her lack album was a mess and I loathe almost everything she released before 2003 (which is two albums worth of material). And now, after her role as &#34;judge&#34; on the American version of The X-Factor, I have to say that I am definitely no longer a fan of Britney, as a person or as a popstar. I don't really understand why she was allowed to be so rude and cruel-- perhaps just as cruel as the media was to her after she was turned into a social perriah.<br /><br />Now comes along Britney Jean. I'm already soured on this woman. It's clear I don't like her, and I don't necessarily wish her any more success. But I'm still gonna listen to it. I mean, I need my dose of guilty pleasure, inane, fun pop songs. Well, much like Femme Fatale, I'm just not finding anything even remotely interesting. The sad rave that was Blackout and then the shrooms trip that was Circus was a left/right two-punch knockout. Femme Fatale was a weak slap in the face, and Britney Jean is already on the floor unable to even swing. In an interview, Britney said she only does this for fun and doesn't really care how it does. Well, that seems like a half-truth. It seems more that Britney does this for contractual obligations rather than &#34;fun,&#34; because she sounds sedated and sleepy throughou the entire project. But let's break this down. Britney Jean was produced in large by Black Eyed Peas abomination will.i.am, a mediocre, self-important infant playing with his big brothers' toys. If you didn't like Scream & Shout, you likely won't find much here you'll like either. His signature is all over this project with its generic beats and flate, late-80s vibe. The EDM-inspiration works the same way the dubstep-inspiration worked on Femme Fatale-- its a gimmick and serves no real purpose as only one of the songs is truly marinated in this genre (Til It's Gone). But by and large, this record's instrumentation sounds more like a glitched Dance Dance Revolution cabinet during a power outage. And then you have Britney's nasally vocals thrown on top of them. I do appreciate the lack of blatant auto-tune, though. It's use is far more subtle. But really, Britney's voice isn't aging well. It has that girlie hiccup to it, but she hasn't honed her skills whereas her mentor Madonna had (Evita).<br /><br />Spears receives co-writing credits on each song, but I do have to wonder just how much she had to do with the lyrics. One could hear her contribution on In the Zone, but any she may have written seems to be lost between the lines written by her studio hands. Passenger, a song written partially by Katy Perry, really has no place on this album. Spears attempts to push her vocals beyond where they are comfortable, and really, this song should have been released by Perry. Or Christina Aguilera, perhaps. And say what you want about Aguilera, but at least she's not afraid of taking risks (Bionic). Spears has been contributing the same amount of boring for abouta decade now. Blackout and Circus are products of their time, when Spears had absolutely no control over her life. And those times are likely never coming back, so for now we're stuck with mediocre pop song collections until her RCA contract runs out. Like we need songs like Alien or Work B****, the latter of which serves to do nothing except giving me a headache. Perhaps the biggest mess here is Chillin' With You, which is, for all intents and purposes, a country song masquerading as an R&B slow jaw. And perhaps most embarrassing is that the guest vocals from her little sister Jamie Lynn are far stronger than her own. How sad.<br /><br />Overall, Britney Jean, her second self-titled record, has nothing good or bad for Spears' career. It's a non-entity, lost in a sea of other boring 2013 releases. It's Artpop. It's Roar. It's Miley Cyrus. It's just boring.
B00BKZUVGM|2.0|One of the biggest things I liked about Allegiant was the character development, for Tris especially, I thought, was very well done. You can see how she has changed from Insurgent. The plot itself was clever and I liked the inclusion of 'real life' in it, and the way it served to the reader, as a reminder that the Divergent universe isn't real, it doesn't exist and we are all as small in the world as Tris was to the Bureau. On the other hand, I felt as if Roth tried too hard to make Allegiant 'bigger' than it needed to be; there was meaning already in the series and this direction felt to me too much like a contrived attempt at creating depth in an already deep storyline.<br /><br />The self sacrifice element annoyed me. That's happened, she did that in Insurgent. I would have liked for her to realise that sometimes you need to take a step back and that her life is important too. It was a disappointing plot inclusion.<br /><br />That's not to say that character death itself doesn't work, take the film Children of Men for example (there are lots more but I can't think of them right now).<br /><br />In Allegiant, I found it to be contrived, disappointing and unsatisfactory. When I read who died I hoped that despite this, the plot would come together and there would still be that feeling you get when you finish the last page of a series, like you've been holding your breath, but it didn't. I just felt sad for everyone in the book. This sort of decisions can work and obviously not everything has to have a happy ending but here it would have been appropriate. The idea was solid but the execution lacked the poise and cohesion that was Divergent.<br /><br />I think Veronica Roth tried to make Allegiant bigger than what it should have been. Divergent worked so well because it was contained, it was clean. But Allegiant delved too deeply into issues that would have been better left untouched. I think Roth took a risk, did what she thought was right but I don't think it paid off.
1452115567|2.0|The idea behind this book is great, but the picture quality is absolutely horrible. The pictures are very yellow and none of them are crisp. Also, I would have liked a little information on &#34;dogs and physics,&#34; like the title suggests. Maybe a nice gag gift, but I was underwhelmed!

B005LAIHY0|3.0|Was looking forward to an Alien prequel.  All set for the action and thrills.  Was not expecting the borefest of this.  Yeah, some good stuff, but too long with too much filler (my opinion).  The background of the movie was supposed to be that an alien race started the human race, later another alien was sent to help the humans and was crucified (gritted teeth at that, but hey, it's just a movie). Aliens were pretty ticked off and sent a ship full of the lovely eggs for revenge. Some pretty over the top revenge, kill one of them they kill all of us. Ship crashes on the way over (you know the rest of that story).  If they had kept with that story and been more direct with it (seems they didn't want to make the creation and crucifixion story too obvious - lose too much money) the movie might have been better.  Or not.  A sequel is planned.  Hope they do better, learn from mistakes.  Hmmm, Hollywood learn?  Maybe not.
0143120530|5.0|a really fun read. It sparked many conversations with friends and clients. I love that the author had the inspiration to go down this path and write about it. A great real life tale about how we all have super human powers at our disposal.
B008I34YYY|5.0|Ok, just plain silliness and fun.  Surprisingly good special effects.  Cheesy everything else, which it was supposed to be.  Don't expect award style anything and just enjoy.

When I watched Bigger, Longer, and Uncut, I was not only met with the awesome humor that Matt and Trey provide, but a lot of messages that I can think about, which are present in regular episodes anyway. The DVD is 120 minutes of pure amazingness. You're going to love the characters introduced here, and genuinely enjoy this piece of art.<br /><br />Viva la Resistance!

B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I love to hunt but when I can't be out there I play this I love it.....yes I'm a country gal
0470876417|5.0|This book is fantastic. I've always done business plans for big or small ideas which I've had, however they tend to be pages, and still don't capture all of what was needed. This framework for building business models makes it so easy and structure at the same time it will be something which I'll be doing for the rest of my life.<br /><br />Don't buy the Kindle version of this book, because it is a highly visual book and it is a really good looking book to hold in your hands. I love my kindle but this is something which can be passed around so others around you can understand what you mean when you start to talk about the model
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love this this game.  It's so much fun and very addicting.  It's super cool just because it's a bunch of minions!
0486409511|5.0|This is the go to book for copperplate. The way they give instructions is invaluable. However, it is just a book. You have to practice, practice, practice.
B00594XOZU|5.0|Its amazing and those people who are saying wont let me log in it does that on kindles...... I tit coase me and my BFF can talk
B005I6EU7U|5.0|Great quality.  My kindle is protected and looks so classy.  My sister saw mine and ordered one for herself.  Some have noted that it was to small, but you need to fit it in tight.  I am glad it fits tight so the kindle won't fall out. Since there is no closure, as it looks and opens like a book, the tight fit protects your kindle.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|At the end of this book I was crying, even as I write this I am weeping . I am only putting this as four stars because of what happened at the end of this story.
B00884GR0W|5.0|This game is so awesome. And unlike mcpe the mobile version has everything the pc version of block story has. This game kind of reminds me of skyrim. Fighting Creatures,leveling up, and a ton of other cool stuff.
B000MQC9H4|4.0|Long time coming but got there in the end good price will use again when purchasing DVD after Christmas and new year
B001F12J3Y|1.0|This movie is NOT 3D it's more like MANGLED DISTORTED 2D very very disapointed I wasted my money on this.
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|My Family loves it!!!!!May the force be with you!!!A great game for the whole family. Keep up the the great work!!
B004ADH1RI|1.0|Possibly the most overrated movie of all time.  Painfully stupid, the only part I truly enjoyed was the credits.  Because it was over.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|This is a great game just wish it was langer... I finished it in two days.. other than that it was great!!!!
B00BD99JMW|3.0|Oh. Well.  I had a lot of hope for this book.  I loved DIVERGENT and INSURGENT and really thought that maybe this series would have a good, solid ending, but, It. Did. Not.  The only way to predict the ending is to think of the worst possible ending and your prediction will come true.  The book was pretty good till the last 50 or so pages.  I'm not going to give you a play by play.  You'll just have to endure it like the rest of us did.  I do hope the final movie is better than the book.
0446547638|5.0|Another great book by Nicholas Sparks!  Fantastic Author never dissapoints!  I love that I can buy a quality book from Amazon, read it and pass on for others to enjoy.
B006O6F932|5.0|So, people say that this is not a good product but I disagree.  A lot.  This is wonderful! People say it always tips and falls over but if only does that for me if I run into it.  Also they are saying the dolls don't sit in the creepeteria table or the desks BUT THEY DO! You just have to have the patience to put them in it.  And someone said that the stickers they come with have no directions on where to put them but YOU PUT THEM WHEREVER! It's to make it customised the way you want it!  This is  a great product and  I would recommend
B002QW7AJY|2.0|An unusual sci fi flick that doesn't do much for me. Very far out there. If you like very strange items, this will work for you.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|Makes learning a language fun, like playing a video game. I am totally addicted. I have been trying to learn Spanish for years and finally dwelling  I'm making progress
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I finally decided to try Google Chrome... It is very easy to set up, installed app on my tablet and in no time I was streaming from Youtube.  My only issue with Google Chrome, as many have mentioned, is that streaming is limited to Netflix, Hulu and Youtube basically.  I have Amazon Prime, and do not have Hulu account or Netflix.
B004DLPXAO|3.0|Just downloaded this app and was VERY disappointed to find that, contrary to Amazon's product description, the New York Times is NOT available for download onto an Android device.  I realize this is probably not Amazon's fault, but they should correct the product description.
B0087FMUCQ|5.0|Just like real golf, this game will drive you mad!  Super addictive.  Great graphics and responsiveness.  It gets harder quick, which was kind of frustrating, but, hey, that's golf!  A very well done game!
B005MMY9A8|5.0|great movie loved it cant wait for a part 2 to come out. graphics were great love it love it !!
B0079XPUOW|5.0|Scalzi is one of those writers who doesn't hide what he's doing, but writes compellingly so that you don't even notice the scaffolding and wires - or indeed, they add to the story. I was very amused at the few people who didn't like the book. I understand why, and it's fine. This novel approach to a story may not be for everyone, but it was certainly for me.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I loved the plot twists and turns...I felt connected to the characters. Didn't fully grasp some of the side characters but loved this story!
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Neil Gaiman's most personal story. I read this quickly even though I tried not to, so I will need to read it again. It was written in response to a time when his wife could not give him the attention he needed to tell her the central story. I've never been so grateful for a little marital strife in my life.
B008133MDK|5.0|Love this series for it wonderful acting, reimagining of the Sherlock Holmes stories and and compelling cinematography... and what a complex end to Season 2. Cannot wait for Season 3.
B008FPOIT6|4.0|Enjoyable, and with a story worth telling. Also, in there somewhere, a morale, making this book memorable. The tone is a bit lighter than in it's prequel, but that goes well with it's more contemporary setting. A tale for hippies in the age of the World Wide Web.
B001UV4XI8|1.0|Product description says 3 discs multi-format.  I received 2 discs in only blu-ray.  Website is misleading.  The chat tech could only say, &#34;I'm sorry, the website information is incorrect&#34; or &#34;This product is also available with 3 discs&#34; and offered to send me a replacement of the product I already received.  This is a great move, but the Amazon website, and very poor attempt at customer retention has left me dissatisfied with this transaction.<br /><br />As copied from the website:<br /><br />Product: Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 1 [Blu-ray] (2010)  (&#60;------ I should have known, however see product desctiption below)<br /><br />Product Details<br />Actors: Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson<br />Directors: David Yates<br />Format: Multiple Formats  (&#60;---------------- Here)<br />Language: English (DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1), French (Dolby Digital 5.1), Spanish (Dolby Digital 5.1)<br />Subtitles: English, Spanish, French<br />Region: All Regions<br />Aspect Ratio: 2.40:1<br />Number of discs: 3  (&#60;------------------- and here)
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|Sometimes we read a book because it's entertaining. Other times, we read a book because we want to learn something. Read &#34;A Thousand Splendid Suns,&#34; and both will happen. Yes, it is a tremendously sad story and one that is astonishingly violent. But it is an important and compelling story, too, telling the reality of life in Afghanistan, especially for women, before and after the Taliban. I'm so impressed that a man could write a book from two women's points of view and get it so right. This haunting story of Mariam and Leila will grab your full attention on page one and not let go--even after you have read the last word. I highly recommend it.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|When I first got into this game I was not good at it but then my plan worked best game ever mimicking!!!!!!!
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|This item is a great product!  Now it needs to do more like live view of your android devices and keeps up with what you are doing and not refreshing every time you go to a  new window in Chrome or open a new tab. Also wish that it streamed in 1080p not 720p.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This was a great book and touched my heart. At the same time, there were some funny, dramatic, soulful parts and that's what made it best.
B004EPYZSK|4.0|A little Sci-Fi formula at times but all in all a good sci-fi  / western flick. Good for more than one viewing.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I use this app on my kindle fire. works great and have never had a issue. would recommend this app to anyone.
B00AKEMHCA|4.0|I love this game it's legit epicness but, for some reason I'm not getting the submarine update. PLEASE FIX!!!!!!!<br />if fixed I will give 5.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Beautifully tragic, suspenseful and thrilling what an adventure that it took my mind threw. Of love, romance and adventure the very thing I seek for in my life. It was very easy for myself to be completely in gulf myself in the story. Well done.
B003V3FVKC|5.0|Great movie.  True story. Makes you realize that you can help people with a step up even if only one at a time.
B00008K7AM|5.0|Love this stupid movie. My nephew loves it even more and we watch it together all the time. Good price for the DVD and fast shipping!
0064431789|5.0|My son knows this story by heart now and it's a wonderful book to share at bedtime.  We very much enjoy the pictures and the story and pretending to make the roaring of the wild thing as well as stomping around makes it extra fun.  It's my favorite as well as his.
B0067EKY9K|5.0|One of my favorite movies. As good as the book and great cast! Ewan McGregor, Emily Blunt and Tom Mison are terrific!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|great game. very fun. keeps my son entertained and its very family friendly. made awesome graphics are great. just love it
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Now I can read everything in my Kindle Cloud on my Smart Phone. I read a lot, especially while waiting for things. Now I don't have to carry anything but my phone, so I'll never be without a good book. Reading and breathing are almost equal for me!
B000OT8GCQ|5.0|This is a great book, as are all of his books. I never read any other author nor do I choose too. You will never get through a book without shedding a little  tear, but it's a good tear. You will find yourself nit putting the book down and reading for hours!
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Thought-provoking and heart-breaking.  The whole situation is impossible but so real that i'm grateful it get written/talked about.  I'm not an expert on how to write books, I just like to read engaging ones that I don't want to put down; this was one of those books for me.
B00FG1Q5J8|2.0|Seems like a really fun game but after every battle it completely freezes my whole device and I have to completely power it down to do anything. Kindle fire HDX
0061714402|5.0|Read it in 1 night. yes, it's that good. Mustaine delivers in this book, it's the rust in peace of metal books.
B008JFUS8M|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie and thought it did the book as much justice as could have been fit into two and a half hours. I am glad they decided to switch directors and was pleasantly surprised that the CGI in Catching Fire was more believable than in The Hunger Games. Yes they did leave out some parts I was hoping they would include from the book, but I was at the edge of my seat the entire time. I can't wait to see what direction they take the films once Mockingjay Part 1 & 2 come out. I would definitely recommend this film to others and would highly recommend them to read the book first.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|i think you are terrible leading Prime Members by not advising you will charge for additional seasons. It is deceitful getting us hooked so you can squeeze out more money. I am thinking of dropping out and not renewing. You also have too many documentaries and English hard to understand  videos. Will stick with Netflix,Crackle and Popcorn and Hulu in the furture
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|super cute minion graphics!! The game is different every time you play, so it keeps you on your toes. Excellent game, even better being free.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|It worked.  Charged quicker.  If it continues to work, I will love it.  The two chargers I had previously quit working within a year.
B00005JLEU|5.0|this is one of our families favorite movies. so fun and unexpected. keeps your attention. lots of fun for kids and adults.
B001BANK32|5.0|I read this book for the first time when I was 16 and it scared me so bad that I couldn't read another horror novel for years. I recently bought to reread so that I can refresh my memory of the characters, before I read the sequel &#34;Doctor Sleep&#34;.<br /><br />If you love ghost stories and being scared, I highly recommend this book. But maybe leave the light on at night. Oh, and don't read it when you're all alone. Spooky!
B004G600A4|5.0|Super funny movie, lots of action, really fun music and great graphics.  nice story line. plenty of fun characters. love it.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|I will probably spend a lot of time playing it.  Just hack and slash and hack and slash. Good graphics.  Easy to uunderstand. It's a fun game.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|Brave is one of my kids favorite movies. They all love Merida. She's strong and brave. Their fave princess. humor drama and lots of fun. great graphics.
B00CM7FLZ8|4.0|I got this the other day on a whim and, although I usually lose patience with puzzle games, this one has enough easy levels early on and mechanics that are fairly obvious but fun and rewarding to watch. So I got really into it...and then I got to Level 10 on the Trigger Happy missions and now it crashes every time I try playing. Hopefully the developer resolves this bug asap, or they will have lost an otherwise happy gamer.<br /><br />**update: the glitch seemed to work itself out shortly after posting this review, so I've moved on to more levels and am still very much enjoying the game. I love figuring out one way to solve a level, but in a less efficient or explosive, point-worthy way, earning a bronze or silver medal, and then immediately replaying it and knowing what I need to do to get the gold medal.
B002VWNICW|5.0|We just purchased a blu-ray player and wanted to see one of our favorite DVD's in the new format (for us)
B004EWFUQY|5.0|Best diet ever (at least for me it is)!!!!!  I've lost over 75 pounds on it.  Try it, it's only the cost of a book.
B00BEIYMTW|5.0|A great movie and wanted to score points with the grandkids who are really into this movie. We (adults) enjoyed it as well
B00FN3HRG4|5.0|Barbra's voice equals butter. The quality of this album is the best. She pays such attention to detail---her clothes, the setting, the choice of music, the additional singers, the sentimental journey back home to Brooklyn, the introduction of her son. She accomplished it all on this album.
B007G51UV0|5.0|Very good mid=range lower priced mother board. I have the Z68 version of this and it has been rock solid. Update the BIOS right away, it's so easy with BIOS Flashback, no RAM, CPU needed, just power to the board.
B00FXES5WS|5.0|Susan sings the Christmas standards as if they were written especially for her. She has  a pure soprano voice and sings with such emotion that she owns each song she sings. She is my best Christmas gift this year.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|I'm embarrassed that I bought this. I didn't make it through the first page, which I should have known given book one. :\
B00FKNBBUA|5.0|Barbra's range of voice and her ability to sing like butter set her above the rest. Like all the best she interests us with her personal creative touches. Her operatic type voice is the best in the popular field. Her Christmas album is beautiful, especially the Lord's prayer.  She can sing anything and it becomes extraordinary.
B000JBWWBK|5.0|One of our very favorite movies.  If you see it, you'll want to buy the soundtrack.  The music is light and takes you right back to the movie.
B00633W614|5.0|Our local library had the other books in this series but not this one.  Ordering it from Amazon to be downloaded to my Kindle took all of about 5 minutes.  It  couldn't have been more convenient.
B00130UFY2|5.0|The Bourne series is the best of its genre.  This does not disappoint.  I would recommend to anyone who is a fan of the series.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|We have Settlers of Catan with the 5-6 player extension, we also have Catan: Cities and Knights expansion with the 5-6 player extension, and last but not least we have Catan: Seafarers expansion with the 5-6 player extension. Needless to say we are fanatics and we have turned most of our friends into fanatics too. We love it! The original is needed to use the expansions. For the basic user, get Settlers of Catan and start there. (It's also a great way to get people hooked.) We got Cities and Knights next which was awesome and totally added to the dynamic of the game. Then we added Seafarers..... mind blown. The board is as big as a 6 person table with all 3, but who cares, it's a blast!!!! We play this almost every weekend and we are still not bored. The board is diverse and changes every time you play. It's never the same. The 8's and 6's are NOT rolled ALL the time. Sometimes 11's is the number rolled the most during a game, but again, it's a wonderful game and it takes up most of our board game bookshelf. ENJOY!!!!!
B0015ABRE2|5.0|Great television series.  The early seasons is when Dexter was at its best.  The later seasons seemed to lack any type of creativity.
B0087FMUCQ|5.0|downloaded it today and haven't quit. absolutely love it. I would recommend this to every single one of my friends.
0307730700|4.0|There are many books out there about Navy SEALs. With the popularity of Chris Kyle and the fame of SEAL Team 6 and the many high profile operations they have successfully executed I was excited to read about what it meant to be a SEAL during this time in our country's history. What I got was not what I expected, but I was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />Adam Brown, a Navy SEAL who fought in Afghanistan is the object of the story. This book is not for those seeking to get to know the grueling details of being a SEAL operator or the training and selection process. It is however a story about a man who overcame an endless amount of obstacles to achieve the end goal.<br /><br />Fearless is a story of Adam, a man who struggled with addiction, who overcame to do some of the most  amazing things for his family and this country.<br /><br />I reviewed this for Blogging for Books program from Waterbrook Multnomah all opinions were offered as objectively as possible in exchange for the copy of this book.
B00EKR61FM|5.0|I bought this item for my daughter-in-law and she loved it. she is an avid fan of twilight. watches it religiously
B005D9MUWY|5.0|It's not as good as the qwerty keyboard i had on my droid4 but it makes a visual keyboard bearable
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Excellent characters, fast paced, and kept me guessing until the very end.<br />Have suggested it to my family and friends.
B00FRQ32N4|4.0|wow 20 words minimum just to rate an app. very odd God app game play is nice wish you didn't have to wait so long to get energy to fight. can only fight 5 times at full energy costs real money to upgrade to 7 but all in all good game for free
B00104W8T6|5.0|Good music, good variety, a lot of very good songs who caught the spirit of the movie - Great !
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|I've read most of Grisham's books and even thou Sycamore Row didn't have me on the edge of my chair it held my interest throughout and the characters in the book were just that, real characters.  If you like Grisham you need to buy this book.
B0087FMUCQ|5.0|What a great game<br /> I have played for many hours not too easy but I like the challenge. And the variety play it and see
B005LAIIKI|5.0|Outstanding movie, casting, action, and humor - I mean who does not love Christoph Waltz and Jamie Foxx, especially when you have Tarantino directing, what a great combination :). This movie did nto have a dull moment, always something going. It is a 5 stars in my book.
B00G6ZTM3Y|3.0|This game is good but it is far too hard to go mining without h all of the monsters. It is pretty fun though. But still it is way too hard.
B0090SI42Y|4.0|I don't understand why so many people have negative feedback on this movie and RZA. I like the action and the imaginary story. good movie to won, can be watched once in a while.
B005SFS4ZU|5.0|Absolutely amazing show! Makes you feel like you are there in the Royal Albert Hall for this spectacular event! The cast is unbelievably talented, the stage and costumes are incredible- Don't miss this one!
B004EPYZV2|3.0|Surprised at the slowness of action and impossible but made to seem possible stunts, no jaw dropping at the edge of you seat stunts.
B007QA3AH2|5.0|Love Tim Allen in most any movie he stars in. Great spoof on the &#34;Trekkie&#34; phenomenon. One of those movies that's just fun to watch.
B00EVW0SA0|4.0|Always like action movies with good fun bantering with the main characters. Glad I waited to watch at home vs movie theater. Enjoyable.
B0039TD7RC|5.0|It's one of the Stones' best albums, and this re-release includes some tracks recorded at those sessions  but not included on the original release.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I couldn't put this book down! Loved the characters, and loved the non-stop action.  Just when I couldn't hold my breath any longer, the final plot twist brought an amazing ending. No spoiler alert here!
B000URWYTS|5.0|I loved this book and couldn't stop reading it and then had to go online to research Frank Lloyd Wright.  It was an amazing story and I had never heard it before.  Well written.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game. So happy it's now on the kindle. Now I can play this game on my computer, phone and kindle. Oh gosh I think I'm addicted
1592536913|5.0|I love this! This is a great reference to start my Steampunk collection.  You don't have to be a professional.  Steampunk is all about junk.  So I put together a lot of things, and people love them!
1451666179|5.0|Awesome, laughter-inducing book.  I love how she can take the hardest subjects (depression) and STILL have me laughing out loud.  I drive my family crazy wanting to read them the stories.  My 3 yr old even likes it because of her adorable illustrations.  Honest and hilarious, true to the blog, just genius writing.
B00BAXFJ5M|4.0|Baldacci does it again!  Excellent characters and an intriguing plot. Loved the dialogue too, but I thought the bad guy's motivation didn't quite correlate with his goals of revenge.  Still a page turner and I would recommend this book.
B00F522C7C|4.0|Very cute, not terribly original, but a nice safe family movie.  My kiddo loved it and I enjoyed the characters and hearing Dane Cook star.
B003NHRIUW|5.0|great movie brought tears to my eyes.  Love to watch it over and over again with my husband, great graphics
B005LAIISA|5.0|This was a cute addition to the series and had a nice family message.  All the favorite characters are back with a brand new story.  Very fun and watchable.
030758836X|2.0|Wasn't my kind of book. I felt it was pretty lame and sort of when on and on and on without much happening.
B00A83075M|4.0|Fun movie, loved the characters.  Just didn't grab me quite as much as some movies do.  Definitely worth adding to the family friendly movie shelf.  Very silly and original.
B0093Q8W0C|4.0|A true classic! Cary Grant is in top form in this case of mistaken identity. While younger people may fault some filming techniques, such as use of models for certain scenes, that's just the way it was done all those years ago. It is still a great story being told as only the master Hitchcock could tell it If you have not watched it, or seen it recently, it makes for a great evening of TV. Watch for Hitchcock in a very early scene as he gets a bus door shut in his face.
B000RO9VJK|5.0|Many great ideas. Reading this book awoke something inside of me that had been sleeping for a long time. Great read!!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|All three books are great. Great read. I recommend. Will not disappoint. More in the books than in the movies.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|so many cool levels* hard/ easy / medium *so many cool ways* if u know someone who never played candy crush u should talk them into playing I just stated it and I Lovin It
B00F522C7C|5.0|i love it  i like to see more  cars & planes  & trains also  uther things too  like to see  its all good  & very good  i lve it
B0050SYS5A|1.0|absolutely useless... my room is small, around 120 sq ft of space and even though my kinect plays flawlessly if i stand at the farthest corner (read center) of my room, this zoom thing doesn't recognize me anywhere... not recommended at all
B0042MEQVG|5.0|It made my daughter very happy to receive it and completed her collection.  She already own the other ones to the collection
B00BSN0K1C|2.0|I believe this is falsely advertised.  The dimensions are listed as 8.5 x 2.5 x 10.5 inches.  If you are looking for a 10-inch tall super hero, this is not it.  I'm not sure what the 10&#34; refers to, unless it is the box.  I'm very disappointed; I purchased super heroes five grandsons, and 2 of them are only 6&#34;--this one and Batrman, the Dark Knight.<br /><br />If you looking for a 6&#34; action figure, this is will meet your need.  But if you were expecting a 10.5 &#34; tall figure, you will be disappointed.
B00F8KIJ2I|5.0|Another winner from Avril! This album is basically a mixture of styles from her previous records combined with some new ones. It is a very diverse album (maybe a little too diverse) and should have something for everyone to enjoy. It is one of her most pop albums to date, at times there is too much auto tune and vocal effects. A lot of the writing is clearly more influenced by Chad Kroeger than Avril. The production on some songs is a little too artificial and weak, even in terms of pop production.<br /><br />I like or love every song on this album, I'd say the weak track and the sore thumb is the EDM track Hello Kitty. Without it, I think the album could have been better. There is something on this album for everyone: her usual anthemic pop/rock songs, piano ballads, a rock song with Marilyn Manson, summer songs, and an EDM track called Hello Kitty. She also explores a bit of indie pop on Hello Heartache and Give You What You Like. Overall it is a very enjoyable album, if you like diversity. If you have only heard the singles Here's To Never Growing Up, Rock N Roll, and Let Me Go, I recommend listening to some of the other tracks, as the singles do not really represent the whole album. This album contains some of Avril's usual bratty pop tunes, but also shows her mature side as a songwriter and shows her veering into a more indie pop direction.<br /><br />It is not her best album and there are definitely improvements that could be made about it, but overall it's a very solid pop album from Avril and one of the best albums of 2013.
147676459X|5.0|Much thicker than expected, great printing quality, and hilarious new content. I was glad to see &#34;The God of Cake&#34;, my favorite post, made it into the book. So glad I purchased, worth every cent!! Hopefully there will be more editions with more of Allie's work, someday! :)
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Story line is well thought out and impeccably written..  Great characters who blend well together.  Shows how WWI had a great effect on the Brittish upper class society, and on British women.
B00BAXFECK|1.0|I had a hard time getting through this book. It definitely has a bit of spirituality in it but I'm still trying to figure out what the message is.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|When everyone else was so addicted to this game I thought they were just crazy. I downloaded it just for s**** and giggles and now im the one addicted.
B004QSQMKE|5.0|This movie is a timeless classic of true love, adventure, and overcoming ones foe. It is well worth adding to the family's video library.
B008ALAHA4|5.0|I keep a couple spare power supplies for my laptop around the house.  When I purchased my MacBook Air with the MagSafe 2 plug it made the spare power supplies useless.  The converter was the perfect answer.  It works for me and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to continue using their old style power supplies.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|This app is the best you need to get simple controls and its free!You would need around 2.5 gigabytes to install but it's worth it .I think the app is cool so I give it a 5 star rating.

B00C5R7B0I|4.0|Not the best book I've ever read but definitely held my interest to the end.  Since I've read every book in the Scarpetta series I feel like I know all of the characters and always enjoy learning the next challenge in their lives.
B00BB8RKH6|1.0|The previews made it seem like this movie would have been about something different.... I just wasn't in to it.

B00957T6X6|5.0|Great book series! Journey through westeros as you experience Martin's tale through varied character POVs. I got this as a kindle book and it is great having them all in one handy place(much lighter than all the books).
B009IQ0TGM|5.0|One of the best albums in my history of music. I am the number one Ellie Goulding fan in the U.S. !  This is her best album yet, better than her newest album Halcyon Days, which is literally this album and Dubstep tracks. Don't get me wrong, Halcyon Days is an extraordinary album but afterwards, (say 3 months) the songs are good, not amazing. Anyways back to this album. The album includes
B00C5R71U8|5.0|One doesn't remotely begin to know or understand Jony Ive the subject of the book, but the list of suddenly commonplace, but unique to modern times, artifacts associated with his name is overwhelming. Not impressive, overwhelming. He ended up reading more like a force than a person. The list of upper and lower case names and acronyms associated wit Ivey, Jobs and Apple go scrolling by like a Times Square Marquee gone mad. An endless list of stunningly original and quickly outmoded products should be boring, but I clung to the words as though it were a Lee Child thriller.<br /><br />So much brain power, so much creativity, so much ego, so much fanaticism, so many power struggles among creative titans and surprisingly little greed are mixed into this tantalizing half told tale. I spent as much time referencing Safari and Wikipedia as I did reading the book. I wanted to fill in the pieces and know these adjunct people and more about the referenced technology. Was greatly a use to see a story in my local paper about one of the deposed Apple princes. Tony Fadell is now head of Nest, and trying to jazz up smoke detectors, using his Apple history to raise money.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|I figure if it takes me 5 years to learn it's ok ... the time would pass anyway!  So far, so good with Spanish lessons- in 5 days I've learned 29 words and don't feel overwhelmed or frustrated (unlike trying to learn French in college!). Only complaint is that the program never really introduces the different verb conjugations it's just all part of the lesson. While I appreciate not having to memorize verbs right off the bat, this also makes getting the correct form of the verb difficult. And I now understand why my French teacher made us do all the verb conjugations!
B002QRWJA4|5.0|My daughter loves this movie!!!! She's watched it I don't know how many times. She's not much into movies, but LOVES this movie.
B0078XFYDA|5.0|As a former Christian I know what it's like to pretend to know things I didn't know and to act like those trying to explain science or natural and materialist things were just deceived by the devil.  It's actually funny in a weird way, to think I was so naive and also so arrogant.<br /><br />This book is a great primer and starter for anyone that is interested in science and natural explanations of things and hasn't had any (or little) formal schooling in those subjects.  Because I've already read The Selfish Gene and other such titles the book was a bit on the \\"too simplistic\\" side, but that is it's charm, it's not meant to be written for someone in college trying to become a scientist, it's written for the layman and for younger readers that want basic explanations for how things work in the universe.<br /><br />Now all that said, I'm not saying I didn't learn some things in here, I'm neither a scientist nor highly educated, so while pretty well read, I did learn a few things in the hard sciences that I hadn't known before.<br /><br />I do recommend this book to anyone that is interested in getting their feet wet in the knowledge of why it's better to believe in a godless universe where science and technology are things that we can count on to help humanity advance and that faith in things that have no evidence for are hindrances to that advancement.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|One of the best books I have read, couldn't put it down.  A very sad story.  Read this before you see the movie.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I recommend this book to those that have seen catching fire and are eager to know what happens next. This is the only book that I have read out of the trilogy and I must say it seems a bit darker than the movies, and I like that.
B009EE70J2|4.0|It must be hard for George Clooney to have people forget he's George Clooney. Hell, in the novel Scottie even walks around in a &#34;Ms. Clooney&#34; tee shirt! He comes close to disappearing into his character in this movie. There's still his occasional smirk, but for the most part, the material allows him to rise above and show a bit more vulnerability. And the story is told beautifully. It has an ease and rolling narrative that breezes from scene to scene. Hawaii is more than the setting, it's the MOOD. And it contrasts perfectly with the inner turmoil Matt King is going through. His decision whether to reveal who his wife truly is to those who love her, to spoil her memory, mirrors his decision on who to sell his land to, and both stories are given great care and affection by Alexander Payne. He finds the humor in tragedy, and knows that no matter what events are happening in people's lives, normal life still intrudes and returns them to the mundane everyday living. In a way that is a curse, to not be able to absorb the depth of tragedies in life, but it is also a blessing, and what keeps us sane in the face of sadness.
B00B0LPWU6|4.0|Parts of the movie I felt a little bit dragging.  But the last scene with the son meeting the father nailed it!  A fabulous job by Denzel Washington!
B000VDUWMC|5.0|Love it or hate it, agree with it or not, this Pulitzer Prize winning book delivers thought-provoking theories. Combining geography and physiology, the author sets out in great detail his theories about why human civilizations developed the way they did across the millennia. Does he have some confirmation bias along the way? Sure. But, this is a very important book and a must read for thinking people pondering human civilization on this planet, past and present. I thought about this book on a recent trip to Alaska. Cruise and tour guides were constantly pointing out how the native peoples survived there for 12,000 years as hunter-gatherers before the arrival of people from other countries. I kept thinking yes, but we wouldn't be here visiting without the trains, planes and automobiles (guns, germs, and steel) brought by the new inhabitants. But, then I visited native villages that are as they were for thousands of years, and I was in awe of one particular large building that was made of wood that was fit together perfectly without nails. it was ingeniously designed to defend hearth and home, heat the occupants, provide for a &#34;walk-on&#34; closet under the floor, and was completely portable! More confirmation bias? Perhaps. But, thought-provoking? Definitely. I highly recommend this book to any thinking person.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Great fun but have had a few issues . I've had to download this game a few times due to errors . Other than that I love playing !
B007MB5OCE|3.0|It was interesting at the beginning as the author is quite the story  teller but then later in the book it really drags.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I loved this book. I started out  feeling a little confused,but quickly got my bearings and then could hardly put it down. I loved the way the story was told and the beauty of the words. I loved the main characters. This is a well told reminder of the atrocities of war and prejudice.
B00AS1Q93S|5.0|Love Lee Child and the character of Jack Reacher!  Have read all of the novels and I am hoping for a sequel!

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have waited forever like everyone else for this game to come available for the kindle!!!!!! Can't get enough of this game!
B001IXXYBA|5.0|A classic!!  who has never seen this movie?  There are some great spiritual truths here!  And the performances of Patrick Swayze, Demi Moore, and Whoopie Goldberg are terrific!!
B002XMGGK6|5.0|If I can be religious for just a moment.  O-H M-Y G-O-D!!!  Mind blowingly good entertainment. Once again, I want a husband who loves me as much as this &#34;law abiding citizen&#34; loved his wife.  Very well acted and directed.  The symbolism is not lost on this movies's director either, when the sherrif's deputy is locked in the trunk while the &#34;law abiding citizen&#34; does his job for him.
B0002WZTOI|3.0|I can take or leave this movie.  I'm a big fan of Tom Cruise, but this movie is poorly done!  The music drowns out the words and makes it difficult to understand!
0545626382|5.0|This is listed under Teens and Young Adults.  It will be appreciated by so many more than that.  We are retired and I think it is one of the best storylines for a long time.  Should be listed for a more diverse group.
0800141660|5.0|Everything about this movie is wonderful; especially Emma Thompson!!  We can never know the heart of someone else especially if that one doesn't share it the same way we do!  The music in this movie is so lovely!!
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Typical Grisham.  Love Jake and Harry Rex.  Lots of surprises. Can visualize Matthew Mcconnehey(sp) in the movie version.  Good read
B007SPPANM|5.0|I love Leonardo DiCaprio!  And he was simply spectacular in this classic!  I watch it often.  It's historic and provocative!!
B000RO9VJK|5.0|This is the definitive book you need if you want to kickstart a business. It is by no means a recipe for success, but at least for me (I don't have any business background) it laid out perfectly the basics and pointed me to the right direction.<br /><br />I definitively recommend this book to anyone.
B00004TS0E|5.0|One of my all-time favorite movies for the Christmas season!  Little Susan is brilliantly played by Mara Wilson; an absolute doll of a little actress!!  This movie should be shown in 2013 as in all the previous years for it's values and principles are timeless!  I wouldn't even consider going through the Christmas Season without at least one viewing of this classic!!
B008VO3PA4|1.0|I hate that I cannot open this book on my Windows 8.  Would you please help me?  It looks like such a cute story.
B0018PH3L0|5.0|This is quite a story, and the two main men are simply so good!!  They make this movie what it is: Robert Duvall and Tommie Lee Jones are wonderful, and Ricky Schroeder turned in a marvelous performance as well!!
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|well, generally speaking, if you have a apple TV, then Chromecast is pointless. at least till they get diff apps and channels on it..
0385523394|5.0|Excellent telling of her experience--not sensationalized.<br />After she arrives at the prison the story is very different from the TV.<br />Good insight to the interpersonal exchanges within the prison.
0920668372|5.0|I have always loved this book. I read it to my 5 year old and he can see the little boys point of view. He loves the book too.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Is it &#34;The Shining&#34;?  No but it is still a very good read. I recommend re-reading The Shining before reading this book. Some of it is recapped in here but better to have the full effect recently in your memory of the beginning of this story.<br /><br />If all you have done is see the movie (The Shining), definitely read the book first.
B005PK553C|5.0|Wow this was a great season!!!! Well worth getting for all the twists it has in it for sure! Again, wow!
B000O8OTNC|5.0|This multipurpose sharpener is way cool! It has the 2 different options to just run your blade through AND the sharpener point to manually sharpen your knife, I'm def. happy with this!
B004SDEP38|3.0|Its nothing more then a document viewer/reader. The reason being since its mobile it takes foreverto edit anything.would not recommend it for editing.
7208091242|5.0|A well presented, directed and acted French film about the rave of the audacious, complicated dance which conquered the society at the cabaret on rue de Montmatre..
B00E9ZFIMM|3.0|I can not give this a fair review since I downloaded it for free but have not really use it
0812550706|5.0|Rereading this sci-fi classic was at least as enjoyable the second time around. I was determined to remember the story before I saw the movie.<br /><br />And what a story – seeming to borrow from many genres, and also from history, religion and myth, Card creates a complex yet simple central character, Ender, who slowly assumes the moral burden of many. The actual story of a child warrior, a target as much as a military commander, is riveting, with twists and turns that rival most narratives. But the consequences of these events compile into the more compelling story, certainly with their interpretation in history. Powerful indeed, with the roles of Ender’s siblings creating an allegory paralleling Orwell’s Animal Farm.
B005J0VPNC|4.0|What can I say. It does what it says that is turn your picture in a paper like or drawing. Wish it had more options
B00081912E|5.0|A funny hilarious movie that you would want to watch again and again. Jim Carrey is a man of many faces and he has the skills to have you laughing until your sides hurt.
B004SDSSFY|3.0|I would give this a better rating but as its made for mobile; things such as editing your document is fustrating as it is time consuming. Its oonly useful really as a document reader
B000059XUP|5.0|It has a different twist compared to the older Crow movie. Some of the quotes throughout this movie are quite powerful. I recommend watching this movie.
B004SKHJF2|3.0|It does recognize most of thr songs but if a song has a lot of bass or is edm music it has a hard time identifying it. If you unstall and reinstall it you lost all the songs that you have idenified. Wish there was a way to save the list of all the songs that have been idenitfy to a server or account
031606792X|5.0|A well written book that I would recommend reading first Before watching any of the movies. The book is ten times better than the movies!
B008IJT0CE|4.0|I downloaded this for free. Nothing beats free. I use this when I want to relax or go to sleep. It helps.
B000GG4Y32|4.0|If you are fascinated in learning about cultures different from your own, I would recommend this. It kept me interested.
B004TTZHBK|3.0|I download because it was free but have never really use any of the receipe because it does not interrst me do I c as n not give it a fair review
1611761565|5.0|This is a well written story. I would even recommend this book for those who have not served in the military.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Can't wait to read the next one. This was a great read and way better than the movie which I saw first.
B008Y1YFNU|5.0|This is awesome music. It will encourage you to continue to listen to it over and over again without getting tired of it.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|I liked it ,but it was a little shorter than I expected and there was a bit too much back and forth.
0817439390|5.0|Excellent book, explains the basic concepts of photography in a way a beginner can understand while simultaneously not falling asleep.  Leaves out a lot of the technical jargon you can find in your users manual most people don't take the time to read, or care about.  I've loaned this book to many of my friends when they're first learning to use a DSLR, and have referred back to it myself on several occasions.
B00A2H9X6I|5.0|Loved every second of this remake, Chloe Moretz was a perfect choice for the role, she's a fantastic actress who has major success in front of her, the movie is practically the exact story as the original plus its given a few modern changes but nothing that's not normal in relation to the modernised story, its a simple and sad story about a victimised girl who struggles to cope at school and is mistreated by her religious nut of a mother, she then starts to discover she has telekinetic powers and begins to harness them until they spiral out of control, the finale of the movie is what you build up to and it was good fun with some bloody death and carnage at the prom, this really is one of the better remakes in past years, it could have been worse, make sure you check it out even if its just for the gorgeous Chloe Grace Moretz!!!!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|These little minions are so cute and it is like temple run so it was familiar to the girls. Love these kinds of games for long car rides! I recommend this game for anyone!
B00EEDNA4M|5.0|I love this show. I love this collectors series. The package is great. The discs are cleverly housed in magnetically latched acrylic coasters which live in the iconic 55 gallon black PVC barrel. there's loads of extra material for the true Br Ba junkie. It's pricey but worth it to have you're own little well of Breaking Bad to return to again and again. and I do because I AM the one who watches...
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Ordered for my girls on their kindle fires....great when u can find an addictive game that silences all the bickering between them....they are actually learning how to ask one another for help. They are 9 & 10 yrs old
1596680180|2.0|I returned this book because it was not what I was looking for, I wasn't able to look at the pages on line so I guessed that it would have the information I needed.  But when it arrived, it was totally different then what I needed.
B00G21XNKU|5.0|Dr. Who is the best and they did a great job on this one! All the Doctors together in one episode.
B008OOYALE|5.0|this game is awesome I think every kid in the world should play it.<br />I like that you can breed dragons and get a dragon you would have to pay gold for.
1451627297|5.0|Stephen King is the greatest story teller of all time.  He proves it once again with this novel.  Absolutely Brilliant.
B0081SRJSY|4.0|I love this game in physical form, so I also figured I'd love it in app form.  It is pretty great, although I haven't been able to change my character, which would be nice.  Very fun.  It does seem to take a lot of battery though.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Quick read. Excited for book 3, the lead character is smart and great and enjoyable and I want to be her
B000FC1AGG|5.0|Sophie Kinsella knocks it out of the park with this one. A truly enjoyable read that made me laugh out loud.
B009O2XY12|5.0|Highly addicting and so fun! Helps me to pass the time while waiting at airports during travel or take a &#34;time out&#34; from daily life in the afternoons.
B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|Bad Luck and Trouble was a good book. Fans of Lee Child’s other Jack Reacher books will probably enjoy it. It was a bit of a change from the ten preceding books in the series. In this book the reader is privy to much more emotion from Reacher and the plot concerns a much more personal subject matter. We see him struggling with loss and self-doubt. We see him question his path. Childs did this while maintaining the integrity of the Character many us have come to love (Reacher doesn’t suddenly become mushy-gooshy or Dr. Phil or anything). While more emotional, perhaps, it was definitely true to form; filled with action, mystery and charm. Also, this book showed even further evolution in the lengthening of Child’s sentences and sentence structure. Overall, loved it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am a total addict to this game. I just love it and can't get enough of it. It is maddening at times, but I keep coming back for more.
B002HFJ77S|5.0|Twenties Girl is a riotous ride along with a hilarious main character that had me laughing out loud for the first time in a long time. The characters are rich, the plot moves quickly and smoothly. Twenties Girl is a great, feel-good read, an excellent addition to the Chick Lit genre.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I'm not the real social network type and I thought that putting this app on my kindle would increase my interest.
B000FCKBCU|4.0|Undomestic Goddess is unlikely, impractical, and at times just plain ridiculous. It is also full of laugh-out-loud moments and dependable fun. Not Kinsella’s strongest work, by a long shot, it is still a fun read that her fans will probably appreciate. If you haven’t read any of Sophie Kinsella’s other works, don’t start with this one. It’s not up to her normal standard. The plot is really out there and at certain points I just wanted to grab some of the characters by the shoulders and shake them. However, as a Kinsella fan, I am glad I read it. Easy, funny, 100% fluff.
B004UID2LC|4.0|This is a quick look at some of the popular videos on YouTube.  Find what you want and watch it nowQ
B003O86FMW|5.0|Another reminder of where current trends may lead us as a society if left unchecked. I enjoyed reading it very much.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Ana and Christian make dreams come true in their love for one another. The best part of the entire book is when he kneels as the sub before her; Proclaiming equality into their relationship.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|This game is really great. If you're a comic book hero fan then it is a must have! I have hours invested in this game because it's addictive.
B00GP0G0IK|1.0|The game was awesome until a few screens later you are abruptly halted because they want $5.00 so that u can continue.  If all of your gmes are like this i will not be using you again.
B00712Y28Q|5.0|This figure is my new most favorite thing ever.  I'm incredibly pleased with it.  The paint job is perfect.  The range of customization options is fantastic.  The figure has a solid heft and weight to it so that it doesn't feel like I'm going to break it when I pose it.  Words can't describe how pleased I was that this figure became available for a more reasonable price, and it has satisfied my expectations in every way.<br /><br />Now, granted, there are a couple of things others might take issue with.  It is large-action-figure sized.  If you're looking for a giant figure, you're looking in the wrong place.  That said, the amount of detail they squeeze onto such a small frame is incredibly impressive, which is why photos make it look so much larger.<br /><br />Second, I did break the figure a bit when I first pulled it out of the box, but that's because I was a little bit over-excited and tried to push Samus's legs into positions they shouldn't have tried.  (I tried recreating the First 4 Figures' statue pose, but those angles are too harsh for this figure's joints.)  The legs popped off the joints, and the rubber piece on the left side of her hips covering the hip joint fell off.  A touch of super glue fixed that, though, and you'd never even know it happened.<br /><br />So, if you're careful, and you have the right expectations about what you're getting, this figure is great.  As a lifelong Metroid fan, she's nearly perfect.  The minorest of quibbles I have is that I'd prefer a Super Metroid- or Metroid Prime-based figure, instead of Other M, but any Samus is better than no Samus.<br /><br />I was sorely tempted to buy this when the prices were inflated on the import versions.  Had I broken down, I would not have been disappointed, so getting this figure for the domestic price was a steal.
B007QA3AH2|4.0|Liken the actors, liked the story line.  Was very entertaining.  Since this was an older movie, it was nice to see how the actor were at a younger age.
B007TNQ7EY|4.0|Awsome game very fun you can play this for hours and not do the same thing tons of cars missions and places
0385349947|3.0|This unlocked the feminist in me as I related to a lot of the internal struggles that many women face, such as not having the same ease of confidence many men possess. I appreciate what she is trying to do for the cause. However, many of my female friends absolutely despise this book, making remarks such as, &#34;it's easy for her to say when she was so lucky with her mentors and married someone rich so she has an army of nannies to help look after her kids. I work hard and assert myself but it's not a walk in the park as we aren't all blue-blooded, pure bred, ivy league people like her who come from a much more privileged class than the majority of us&#34;.<br /><br />Personally, I don't necessarily disagree with them, but I choose to take away the good parts of the book. I think she mostly focuses on the 'internal' challenges of being a woman in the workforce, including how to deal within a male-advantaged structure. That is helpful for me since I suffer from many of the same insecurities that she does. Having said that, I agree with my more skeptical friends that this cannot be the only solution -- women need to not just learn how to deal with the current situation but also lobby and fight to change it. We need to make sure that externally, businesses don't have structures and cultures that are male-advantaged. Sandberg's group has been in some cases shown to be rather dismissive of people that have tried to highlight the fact that she does not advocate or support fighting the good fight but instead 'give in' by just providing strategies on how to survive within the current environment. I understand this, but I also understand Sandberg can't and doesn't want to fight on all fronts. This is what she wants to focus on, and it's better than nothing. She helps change the environment in her own way, by encouraging women to pursue leadership positions and for these women in leadership positions to help other women. By doing so, there will be more women in the work force and things will organically change.<br /><br />Some friends also say that Marissa Mayer is a far better role model as she is tough as nails and is CEO, not COO. I love Marissa Mayer and am proud of her (i know, not that she cares!) and look up to her. However, she has not written a book about her experiences and lobbied for women. She's a great leader that happens to be a woman is all, while Sandberg seems to come across as a woman that happens to be a leader.<br /><br />Also against Mayer is the fact that people see her act of removing working-from-home as a move against women. While it does affect many women, I am pretty sure she didn't do it because she was out to get women, she did it because logically and practically she felt that it was the necessary thing to do to knock the company into shape. It was a business decision, nothing personal. What annoyed me about this though, and this lowers my regard for her greatly, was that she installed a nursery in her office. Great, you remove working from home, which affects men and women parents alike and they have to deal with it, while you get to have your kids near you? Talk about being elitist and cold. I am sure Sandberg would have been more sensitive to the people issue when making such a decision.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I enjoy playing this. It's not hard to figure out at all. Passes time and makes funny crunchy noises. I gave a 5 star rating.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  Was sad to see it end. I would recommend this book to my book club members.  I recently saw this movie, which further enhanced my enjoyment of this book.
B00GP0G0IK|4.0|Good game. But just ends. I guess I should have used the hammer instead of the blood. I'm gonna try this again with the alternative ending.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|I love superheroes from the start and this game is the best make one for all D.C. heroes and marvel or both combined would be rad. This game is the bomb and so are my ideas coming from grandmaster game
B00GIXY4M8|2.0|Predictable, average, and I have to say basically this movies sucks.  Definitely does not live up to the hype.  Unless they drop this to free don't waste your money.
B001KWN3Z6|5.0|I love Joni Mitchell in her early career.  She sings like and angel and wrote her own songs.  I highly recommend this and other recordings from the 70s, etc.  I do not recommend her most recent recordings as she has smoked since she was nine (I heard her say this in an interview) and it has clearly taken a toll on her voice.  But, again, these early recordings - one of the most beautiful voices I've heard.
159514188X|3.0|I read this book in about 4hours.<br />I liked this book at first,<br />but at the end I had mixed feelings about it.<br /><br />I give it 3.5
B000SGRONM|3.0|If you're a fan of David Sedaris's work then you'll quickly discover that a lot of the stories contained in this book were pulled from others that he has released in the past.  But if you're new to this author I would probably suggest that you start with another book (Me Talk Pretty One Day and Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim are my favorites - When You Are Engulfed In Flames is not too bad either -).<br /><br />I think the only story that I really found interesting in the entire book (for someone like me that has read his other books) was the one about his experience working as Santa's elf at a New York department store (I think it was Macy's).  It might be another repeated story. but I don't remember reading it elsewhere.<br /><br />One last thing I have to mention is that some of his made-up stories (that are not based on his life), tend to border on creative and morose.  They're not bad, but compared to stories like the Dutch and their Santa's 6-8 black men; they're not on equal ground either. (I enjoy his life experiences over the fictional stories)
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I have mixed feelings about this book but I can honestly say by the end I was looking foreword to the next book.
1250027624|5.0|Downton Abbbey is one of the most amazing bodys of work TV has ever produced and this beautiful book helps fill the gap until season 4 starts. I love that it gives many details about each character and the pictures are beautiful.<br />Very much worth the price I paid.
B0064W652A|4.0|I really enjoyed Hush. It perfectly mixes action and detective work. The Hush character was projected early on in the book, but it was still a good mystery.
B009NPA3MS|5.0|Just saw him in concert at River fall WI and he was Great.<br />His band he is touring with is great also.  Had to buy the CD to listen more!
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|Gritty and a change from previous movies with  a new twist. The actors did a superb job of making this realistic.  Recommended
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I loved this book so much and I would highly recommend it to anyone that is awesome because this book is just so awesome that I read it for at least three hours a day until I finished it.
159668139X|5.0|I'd recommend this book to anyone starting on the adventures of weaving.  While much  of the information provided in this book can be found in others, Ms. Chandler's chapter on reading, understanding and creating drafts was alone worth the price.  Including drafting exercises was genius and has given me the knowledge to venture out and create my own.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Both my husband and I enjoy Downton  Abbey, and Season 3 kept us riveted just as the previous seasons did.  I especially like the historic context, since I didn't have much of a feel for the experience of trench warfare before.  It was also interesting to learn how recently homosexuality was illegal.
B000HT3PPG|5.0|This is another Christmas movie classic! I grew up with this as a traditional movie we watched each Christmas season. This never gets old with us! The moral of the story....hope is always there! And miracles do happen!
0142410705|5.0|Best book. A learned interesting things and the math was actually interesting. Great book and I highly recommend it to anyone.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|good read. I haven't gotten all the way thru, but the first nite I ordered I found myself still up @ 2am reading!!
0984380213|4.0|Great book.  not the be all and end all, but just good information.  very quick read so that gave it an extra star.
0451417704|5.0|All kinds of exciting modern technology thrown into a fast moving thriller that asks real questions about what kind of world we want to live in. Can't wait for the movie.
1742204147|5.0|I am the family's informal travel agent and help my extended relations do trip planning. My cousin and her family asked for my assist in planning an upcoming trip to Japan. I also plan to go there in the near future myself. I found this book to be absolutely top notch in all aspects of trip planning. It well covers what to see, where to stay and how to best get there. This is a serious book for trip and travel planning; there are not a lot of frivolous photos of pretty cherry blossoms here. I especially like the maps of each island and the Tokyo city map that separates from the back. I think this book is well laid out and has a strong emphasis on usefulness. Since no one in my family can ski, I could just skip that chapter.<br /><br />I love the Lonely Planet series of books for travel but I definitely recommend this volume on Japan highly.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|The app does everything I need it to do.  I've been using it for six months to wake up by.
B009A9SULS|5.0|It is very, very small. But it is great. I have read almost non stop on it during the latest snow day. While it is small, it has changeable font. I am using the largest font and there is no problems. it is very enjoyable to have. I have other ereaders but this one is really, really good. yet is it is a bit slow on the touch screen but I like that. highly recommended.
B008JFUPK8|4.0|Think they did a great job. Hardcore comic book fans also like it a lot.  I think they should have focused more on him growing up, and had a different enemy instead of rehashing older movies.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This book ends with multiple bangs.  I just read the last line of the book and I'm awestruck.  This story is both beautiful and terrible.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|It explains Christmas Spirit spectacularly.  Absolutely wonderful.  There is no book that puts the Spirit into Christmas as well as this one
0151003084|5.0|Can't wait to read this to our newborn as his first baby book!  Definitely has the feel of a 1920's book.
B00G32QIEG|2.0|An OK movie.  Very light entertainment that I can recommend as a rental.  If you liked 'Men in Black' it is a very similar storyline
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Best bingo game out there!  Lots of variety and hours of fun!  Works well on kindle fire and within facebook
B00F2HW220|5.0|This is possibly my favorite Ayreon album.  Ayreon albums are like a gigantic puzzles where Arjen moves the pieces around until it completes a theme oriented rock opera.  I do not know if anyone can create this since it is such an enormous undertaking to write, compose, and organize all of the pieces.  For this reason, Arjen is a genius to be able to encompass all of these intertwining variables in grandiose fashion.  He clearly has the skill and personality to pull off these albums time and time again, and it is a true gift.<br /><br />On this album, what stands out to me is that it has some big name musicians and fewer vocalists than the previous effort.  The keyboards from Rick Wakeman, Keith Emerson, and Jordan Rudess are wicked good.  This has been such an enjoyable album for me, that I hope Arjen continues to create them.
B00G4EXNNM|5.0|I am so happy when I experience something that awakens in me the kind of primal and visceral joy I used to feel so often as a child.  Thank you, Billie Joe and Norah for this fabulous confection!<br />  The interesting thing is that neither voice heard by itself is reminiscent of the Everly Brothers, but together....they are.  And what a collection of songs.  Great American Music.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|If you are a king reader this book is really awesome. I could not put it down and I am bummed out that I'm am done reading it already.
B004HW7JMO|5.0|It was great DVD if you like the Show and that Gannicus was Real if look it up not just made for the show he was<br />Spartacus right man.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|You will love this game. The new challenge is awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!! And the horses are not traned ,but it is so much fun to Tran them.
B00A8MGLAI|1.0|Kira at Bashi.  Rai and Jiri at Lungha. Rai of Lowani. Lowani under two moons. Jiri of Ubaya. Ubaya of crossroads, at Lungha. Lungha, her sky gray.  Darmok and Jalad at Tanagra.  Darmok on the ocean.  Kiteo, his eyes closed.  Temba, his arms wide/open.  Mirab, with sails unfurled.  Zinda, his face black, his eyes red.  Chenza at court, the court of silence.

B00GJ8K3G8|2.0|Sadly this is not Rhapsody of Fire anymore. This music doen't sound like the Rhapsody I love, they lost a lot of the power and epic sounds they had before. The split afected this Rhapsody in a big way, but not Luca Turilli's Rhapsody wich still sounds great to this day. This band transformed from Rhapsody of Fire to any given metal band with the same name. Shame!
B0025UHKNS|1.0|This very expensive watch is extremely difficult to understand, use or handle. Takes an eternity to identify satellites, and  a full year of classes is needed to understand and use it correctly. To support  these comments, please notice that is not an isolated opinion; the market talks. The forerunner 305 price during 2011/2012 was around $ 180/200. The 405 price largely exceeded in those days the cost of a 305. A reverse situation can be now appreciated; 305 selling price doubles  405. Why? The 305 is simple to handle, reliable, and with best big numbers.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|Injustice God's among us is one of the best games I ever played in my life. Trust me you want to get this app.
B00C5R7B0I|1.0|if this is someones first Scarpetta it will be their last.  For those of us who have read them all, it´s the worst.  tooooooo slow, to much self pity, to much Scarpetta and not enough story.  Found myself skiping whole paragraphs! maybe it´s time to retire her and give us something new.
B0078X2LKY|5.0|LOVE THIS BOOK.  My parents read it to me growing up and now we're enjoying reading to our kids.  Classic.
B001P7HUF0|4.0|It was ok. The acting was good, for the most part, and the story was ok, but the pace of the movie was painstaking. I'd consider it a rental, not something I'd add to my collection.
B00AVXVQGI|5.0|I read a lot as a girl but did not read romances and did not explore Jane Austen's work. A film of Persuasion induced me to read it and I enjoyed it very much. Her description of manners and thoughtfulness about matters--things I took for granted 50 years ago--now stand in stark contrast to prevailing norms. I will read all of her books now and anticipate the act with pleasure.
B00CNQ7HAU|3.0|The over-the-top reviews of the book made me buy it.  As a sequel to The Killing, it fails in one aspect--caring about the main characters.  The legal twists are interesting and the last scene in the book is chilling.  In Grisham's early works (my favorites), particularly The Killing, lives were at stake.  In Sycamore Row, it's money.  To be fair, Grisham well makes an historical point about slavery's influence that I appreciated.
B001N4OX82|3.0|Good cinematography.  Somehow one is left wondering how the story was preserved so long when it was just a bloody fight over a straying woman.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Excellent device for the money!  I just wish it came with a remote.  That would make it perfect.<br />With more apps being added to this in the last couple of weeks, I'm increasingly hopeful of its flexibility.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This is woo cool it has like 100+ games how many other apps have that many games. I have played this a lot I highly recmend this
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Worked great initially, then erratically, then stopped functioning completely. Support sucks. You shouldn't have to spend 30 minutes troubleshooting your system every time you want to watch a movie. If I could give it no stars, I would. Avoid. Buy Apple TV or anything else out there.
B009LDCZ7I|5.0|The show is riviting.  However, on season one  discs, disc 3 repeated 2 episodes already viewed on an earlier disc.  Minor inconvenience .  Great series!
B00E8JTSVG|5.0|This Fantasy story has kept me so entertained that i couldn't put it down, besides being so absorbed into the mesmerizing characters and beautifully written plot, the book uncovers a mystery that none of us could predict. This author is on my watch-list!
B003HJBZ3M|5.0|Great album. Be aware that if you buy the Legend Deluxe edition this disk is disk two of that collection. You can get a better deal by buying both together.
1781162646|5.0|This book made me feel truly happy -- and I needed to feel happy.  Yes, there is the element of supernatural seers and the murder mystery and whatnot, but overall, the book is about a young man finding his place in the world.  The backdrop of Joyland and the Carolina shore were beautifully written (and well researched I might add), and Mike and Annie's story really resonated with me.  Mike's big day at Joyland was one of the happiest things I've read in a long time -- I found myself grinning.<br /><br />I also quite enjoyed the scrabble scene - haha.
B002NQ3AAQ|5.0|This movie was a gift for a friend, and one of my favorite movies of all time.  Just thinking about it makes the keyboard fuzzy for a bit.  If you've never seen this movie, you missed something great.  This is a gritty, gripping tale of a boy growing up amid chaos and strife.  I'm sure other reviewers have other things to say, but this movie speaks to my heart, and I have no higher praise.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|This is a very good game, and very addicting. I like the 3D aspect of the game, makes it more of a challenge.
B0007Y89ZM|5.0|Not much to say about this except it is the Eagles, one of the all time greatest bands ever for all generations.
B008M721MS|5.0|I love this app, it's the most amassing app for calls and video calls! You can get your friends and family to call you and see them if you chose. I've used this app alot ,althought it may only work on Kinde Fire HD ,its great for talking and even if I don't know, your deaf you can see each other to do sign language. And there's also a chat so you can talk to them by reading and typing. But even better, you can create group calls a chat to all of the people on that call! There is a certain area  where you can buy &quot;skype credits&quot; to call someone's phone but everything else should be free!
B00C5R8364|5.0|This was a very fast paced book that was hard to put down.  Many true facts and people make the story believable.
B00BGD8CFK|5.0|This case is just absolutely fantastic! It is my absolutely favorite case. I refuse to take it off. It protects my phone and at the same time is slim enough to fit in my pocket easily. I've bought other cases for easily twice this price and only used them a few times, so this is definitely worth the price! I HIGHLY recommend this case!
B004EPYZZ8|5.0|wonderful wonderful wonderful. some 'christian content' (underplayed, overreported),<br />recounts the story of a very chalky and resilient surfer who loses her arm to a shark.<br />with the help and encouragement of incredibly supportive family, she overcomes<br />extreme adversity to resume a professional surfing career (a lesser person without<br />the family challenging and prodding? not happening). the last scenes of film<br />are transcendent.
B00028HBKM|5.0|From what I have read and herd from others who have researched this that as vivid and graphic as the movie is that the actual events were 5 to 7 times more horrific.  With that said this movie still gives you a good understanding of what Jesus (The Christ) went through.  The movie should come with a bot of Kleenex.
B00G32VYDG|1.0|A very bad twist on a decent movie. Not near as good as MIB. It's really to bad the story and plot were so bad because I really do like the actors.
B00CH3DBNQ|4.0|“I am Malala” is a fearless memoir, and despite it having been ghost/co-written with journalist Christina Lamb, Malala's voice is heard whether talking about competitiveness, fear or passion for learning for herself and all children in her homeland. It is well-written and and give that credit and rating to Ms Lamb... it's her skill that has told this story.<br /><br />This is a memoir but also includes Pakistan's complicated history, convoluted politics, and a people and faith that Malala obviously treasures and honors.  I felt a bit lost at times  stumbling over names and cultural words...likely much like many Americans would be...and realize how much in my life is taken for granted.<br /><br />This young girl is really brave and  I feel, her father has been instrumental in shaping her thoughts; molding her character.  However, the book also reveals her Father has exceptional courage, with a profound belief in the right of every child to fulfill  his or her potential. In a land that esteems boys and commiserates with the family when a girl is born, Ziauddin was the exception.<br /><br />My belief after reading this book is that whether any third-world or Muslim nations likes it or not, their girls are among its greatest resource. Educating them may be the single best investment to improve their economy and the country's living conditions. That is the main lesson that one should take away from this book.
0449911357|5.0|Until now I only had the movie to go by but, after reading the book I love the story even more. I love Fannie Flagg as a comedienne and now also as an author.
0788859544|5.0|Arrived quickly and in perfect condition with an outer protective sleeve for the DVD case. I will be giving this as a gift to my granddaughter for xmas so this was nice to find since she has excited over Arial all summer and all we could find now is blu-ray.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Absolute junk - - gave it away to a co-worker I don't like.  You better have a SmartPhone first to use it.  Very confusing to use.  I work in electronics designing navigation systems for airplanes, so I'm no stanger to eletronics..................besides, it's extremely limited in what it can do.  You can only watch so many YouTubes!!!!!
B0027MJU00|5.0|Love her writing style. Book is pretty dark and gruesome which I usually don't like but it was a great read.
B0040I09RM|5.0|Best show ever. Always action going on.  Love the characters and their intensity.  There always seems to be comedy thrown in the mix
B002LMV7TS|4.0|The movie quality is good but the blu ray and dvd look iffy kinda fake looking but it works thats what matters
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I love this show and the fact that I can watch it instantly on Amazon Prime makes it even better!
B0094BB4TW|3.0|the bottom where it as the newsfeed, messages, notifications etc. keeps blinking every time I go on the app. but good
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Dryly.  Inner Goddess.  Overly bitten lips.  ugh.  Perhaps the best part of this book is the back and forth of their email exchanges.
B00GSAC1UI|5.0|Absolutely amazing music!  I wish they had more Christmas songs available! Can't wait for the next one to come out!
B00C1S945G|5.0|I absolutely love the BluRay remasters of the Next Generation. It's like I'm watching the entire series for the first time again with a whole new depth of color and clarity. The fact that I get it for free with Amazon Prime is icing on the cake, since I already own the original DVD Box sets and would hate to purchase them again. I can't wait until they add the rest of the remasters as they come out.
B001EBWITA|5.0|Best movie ever, is a got to watch i cannot wait for a sequel, if there is any. I really recommend it.
B0081336FO|5.0|AWESOME!!!!!  The stories are very well done. Benedict Cumberbatch is a fantastic Sherlock. I recommend this show to all Sherlock Holmes fans. The relationship between Sherlock Holmes and Watson is exciting to watch.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|My 7 year old daughter and I have so much fun playing this!! We try to strategize how to get the most points.....the only downside is when you run out of lives!
B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|When I collected 5 pages slender popped up in front of me with moving sharp end tentacles! I nearly s*** myself during each jumpstart! I would give it a 5 if you could run, they should also fix the camera and make the death better. Other than that it is AWESOME
B000J5XS3C|5.0|I have had a lot of fun with this.  It does exactly what it says and I've not had any problems with it.  I use it weekly for a podcast for 3 inputs. I think for the price, it's well made, and I have not had any doubts of it's stated capabilities. I transport it in a padded backpack and based on previous reviewer's comments about the power cord casing falling apart, I've been careful with it not to bang it around.  It's held up great. It doesn't feel loose at all either.  The only thing that I don't consider to be a complaint but I would change is to add a power button instead of it coming on when you plug it in. But that's not enough to lower it a full star.  It still works and that doesn't effect the performance.  Maybe if you are a person that leaves it where it sits, it's more convenient to have a power button instead of unplugging it, but for my purposes, it's fine.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game it is so awsomely cool its the best game I mean it does have 100 games plus more you should so get it
B00479SVBU|2.0|It worked for about 6 months just fine, but now it takes forever to read the memory card. The thing is incredibly difficult to navigate even with the remove control and the text doesn't scroll when it's highlighted. The words just go off the screen. This is incredible annoying as most of my audio book disc titles are long and start with the same words. I'm stuck trying to figure out the difference between &#34;Harry Potter and the...&#34; and &#34;Harry Potter and the...&#34;. Why u no scroll?
B005DNPKSQ|5.0|My favorite movie and I saw that it was listed as one of IMDB's top 250 movies. Stream quality is also very good, and I liked being able to turn on subtitles.<br /><br />Jim Carrey is one of my favorite actors and this is by far his best work.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|shit novel, worse than the high school student assignment.Day dreaming by a love making-desired girl. Waste my money to buy it. The only thing can be pointed out is that it could comfort someone without wonderful sex with their partners by the literal image of SM description.
B003NFM3JK|5.0|Great movie... my case was cracked a bit but the movie was not scratched and works well so that is all that really matters I suppose. My husband has been dying to add this to our collection of Christmas movies. It really does make you think about being less of a scrooge as we can't take our possessions with us.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I loved these books so much I have read all three in 5 days! The best story I have read in a long time!! Never a dull moment.
B00ELE8D4Q|5.0|I love the CD. I love Cher. Thank you for sending at a timely mannor. Hope you have a wonderful Holiday
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|I have only been playing for couple weeks it a great game. Graphics and challenges are fun the addictive part is winning each trophy or mission. The bears and wolves are hard if you don't shoot them right away. I just started the African Safari and its  hard  to get the animals they are fast.<br />I recommend it for anyone who likes a challenge.
B00BATG18K|3.0|Good read, but very long and drags a bit in the middle.  Much of it was very similar to Memoirs of a Geisha.
B0073RSVMC|5.0|I love how it is easy to hold in a child's hands. The paint job is excellent are the scales and feet. I love that jaw movement! It is not huge like the ones made by animal planet but those are for a different kind of play. The quality of this company's toys is excellent.
B003O86FMW|5.0|These books are addicting and I couldn't hardly put them down. It is great that they are offered for your kindle because my bookshelves are quite full. These are a must if you like the movies... heck, they are better than the movies and I loved the first film.
B00DXP7L88|1.0|After a return to promise this series falls flat on its face.<br /><br />I am not sure where to begin with out spoiling it for anyone, though I doubt you could dodge the story line if you read the online new sites at all.<br /><br />The story is just garbage and contradicts everything the first season set up.  Dexter has gone 180 degrees from where he started a cool careful rational person to what we have now a irrational, reckless some would argue not intelligent person.  The story he is involved in is one that just never really fits the series, I am surprised anyone thought this was a good idea.<br /><br />The actors outside of Micheal C Hall do not get a shot to work with any of the material especially the biggest bombshell in the series.  With a talented group they really short changed everyone on the cast.  This is what happens when actors get more of the pie of a series, really they should have brought in the writer of the books and let him finish out the TV Series.  While watching the extras as this happened (Having Showtime) the writers are delusional about what they were doing.<br /><br />Over all you will find that C. Hall does a great job with the material, everyone else gets short changed.  The story will frustrate you especially if you think that around season 3 the writing went down hill.  They p.lay out the first part of the season way to long and do not give any of the core actors that have been in the series since day one, much time to bring closure to their characters.
1449410243|5.0|I purchased two of these books, one for a gift.  The recipient loved her copy, and I love mine!  VERY funny!
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|City of Bones will keep you guessing at what's true and just when you think you've figured it out, something new happens! I loved it! It completely exceeded my expectations. My only quibble is how little Clary really DOES as the child of Shadowhunters! I mean, really, c'mon! Simon has more action sequences than her! Hopefully, City of Ashes will deliver on that...Oh, and the love triangle in this book is ridiculous! You won't believe it till it happens! Holy cow!
B00EEL0LGY|4.0|Fun with good mechanics. Kinda ridiculous with the in-game prices on upgrades and new watercraft.  Only thing keeping it from being a five star game.
0553582011|4.0|bought for Xmas present for my son, who has already read my hard copy....before wraping I perused the never before released WoW gift chapter at end of book, a Barriston Selmy POV!
B00008J2PG|5.0|Awesome film of a true WWII story that is inspiring.  Gregory Peck is great in his performance as a priest in charge of anti-Nazi resistance in Italy.  Entertainment well worth watching for the whole family.  Cinematography is not the greatest, however the story is superb and well acted by all.  For some reason this film is not easy to find anywhere and I was very glad to find it here on Amazon.
0451529065|5.0|Perhaps the most important and elegant theory presented and confirmed in the last Millennium, presented by the co-discoverer in his words!
B00492ANTS|5.0|Anything by Bill Evans is worth a listen. Only got one chance to hear his trio in 1979. Best concert I ever attended, period.
B003VANOFY|5.0|I hate wires. I hate them as I hate Hell, all Montagues and thee. This thing gets a little funny if you have USB external speakers. Conflicting drivers and such. Other than that I have little to complain about. As good as any headset I've had and better than most. Buy this and you'll be insulting noobs in no time, and all without the burden of those god-forsaken wires tying you down and reminding you of that time that Gary Hensler tied you to a lamp post with an extension chord and made the neighborhood kids pee on you.
B008P1EWIM|3.0|The layout for long term forecast only works on the text layout. If I pay for an app I kinda like it to work as it says it should. That being said it is a very aesthetically pleasing app and if the long term forecast would actually show up in the layouts that state it should I would rate a five star.
B00271DNP4|5.0|I ordered this film for my grandson for the second time.  He has become a big Harry Potter fan - reads the books and enjoys the films as well.  Thanks for making them available.
160774418X|5.0|My favorite cookbook from a library of cookbooks! I have the UK version and have gifted this many times to fabulous results. While some of the ingredients might take you to a specialty store, the book is very easy to read and processes are outlined in perfect order. A must for any home cook (or professional!).
0525478817|5.0|A painfully honest book, The Fault In Our Stars is a must-read no matter what your taste in literature is.  The tale of two adolescents who meet in a cancer survivor's support group touches the heart deeply without being maudlin and sentimental.
B0006JGFNQ|5.0|In perfect condition. This will be a hit for christmas this year for sure. Thank you for the perfect gift
B002BVQU5A|5.0|All the actors in this movie are on my 'favorites' list. The story is unique & is always fresh each time I watch the movie. Can't deny Johnny Depp is a particular favorite - he's an excellent actor who strives to entertain.
0765325950|3.0|It's kind of a let down  -  all of the other books I had no trouble getting through and loved every one of them, but this one has taken me weeks and weeks.  I'm 3/4 of the way through it and still do not find anything that compels me to want to pick it up and read it other than the fact that I want to know how it ends after reading 13 other novels to get to this point!  I really like Brandon Sanderson and thoroughly enjoyed the other two novels he wrote to complete this series for Robert Jordan and have enjoyed some of his other works very much too, but feel like it should have been ended in the last book and that the whole story has just been drawn out way to long.
B0001WTVUW|4.0|very good reality movie from the 80&#34;s it was very interesting about world war affects on life in general  bad.
B007TK77QE|5.0|It is a fast moving story that could apply to any community with typical characters that are found everywhere.  I loved that they were so real and not polished perfect.  A really good read
B00005ATQF|4.0|A great movie from Kubrick, one of his best.  Would have given this five stars, but the case is a little weak, would have preferred a hard-shell case for the DVD.
B00DNB9RXO|5.0|really cool but until when I'm downloading the app it was really slow great app those p.s if u r into<br />kitties get it
B0084IG8TM|5.0|So while I admit that before I had seen this I thought it would follow most of the other books turned into movies and suck. I was wrong and it stayed to the book pretty close. As close as a PG-13 can be of the book I suppose.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|Page flipping fast paced.  Makes you think and wonder what if?  I don't want to find out!  Looking forward to the next one.
B00005JMXX|4.0|very interested in the affects of global warming , but this was supposed to be the sequel to the day after.
B000X1T7MS|5.0|They provided very good service.  The item works perfect and was in great condition.  It was packed well.  Prompt delivery.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This a fun mind bending game-you have to really think your way thru the moves.  I enjoy playing it and am just at the initial level with a lot more to go.
B00575MDL2|5.0|The sinfonias are instrumental interludes from cantatas, usually scored for orchestra and organ. Those on this disk are well played and seem to have given the performers as much pleasure in playing as I get from listening. Highly recommended
0765325950|5.0|So I will admit that I love this series, and was worried when Brandon Sanderson took over finishing it. Not that he is a bad author or anything. I am very pleased with how it turned out. I try not to use spoilers in my reviews.
B000AP2ZDK|4.0|Different yet a great listen for Dilla. I liked all the tracks but could not give it all 5 stars as other tracks he's produced for others were far better.
B001DTPZNY|4.0|Liked all of the other Indiana jones movies he did to bad it took so long to do number 4 but it was worth it .
B00ECTZKJ6|4.0|If you like Korn, you like this. It's not their best work. It's Korn for crying out loud, so it's still darn good.
B00BC254I8|5.0|This was a better than average read. Very forthright and real. It might be one of the best autobiographies out there.
B00BAXFJ5M|5.0|As always, a great book. Action packed, suspense filled,& another one you can't put down. A must read for Baldacci fans.
078881172X|5.0|Peter Pan is a great movie. For young and older. I being 23 still enjoy watching it from time to time.
B00957T6X6|5.0|This collection took me six months to finish but every minute is so worth it. I feel so lost now that I'm done...
B000JMKQX0|4.0|I though that is book was well written because the war already happen and  you are learning about it from different people
B008JD7VZM|2.0|Anyone with previous LEGO experience will be disappointed with the product. For the price charged, there is not nearly enough to the LEGO set to be priced the way it is. The set comes in a box smaller than a box of Kleenex. I expected a much larger set for the price.  It looks like they get by using very small pieces.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Didnt think I would like it cause a lil cartoonish I was wrong it awesome I cant stop playing it
B00E6X4GAW|5.0|The story told here is an important one for freedom. Freedom in learning and speech is one that is a universal right for everyone whether girl or boy, black, white or any other colour, rich or poor. I hope Malala keeps speaking out.
B0090SI56Y|4.0|I like this movie it had action and suspense... Mystery and even a cliff hanger or two. You get to see a bit of Wolverines history and how his long life has affected him.
B009LDD1X0|5.0|This show just keeps on getting better. The addition of all the girl friend's adds a great dynamic and who doesn't love Sheldon and Amy?
B00B1E6FF8|5.0|Exact, honest and honorable portrayal of all who served, fought, examined, researched one man and never gave up; so many paid with their lives to see justice.  We all owe gratitude for their sacrifice; thank you Ms. Bigalow for getting it right and fighting to keep it real.  That is honorable film.  Thank you.
B004J4WNL2|4.0|This is a very easy to read book. Informative and eye opening whether you are an introvert or not it offers great insights.
B000Y0Q5NM|5.0|I gave this a 5 star rating as this was one of my favorite episodes of this series. I'm a subscriber to a different instant streaming site that rotates their instant selection of shows. So it was great that I was able to purchase just the episode that I had an urge to re-watch. Great sound & video quality.
B00GFOIUVQ|5.0|This game is cookbook good it has really good graphics and it never glitches. The levels get harder and harder but it is fun because it is a challenge. It has so many levels and I never get tired of it. This is the best game.
B005LAIHSG|5.0|So while I will admit I am not necessarily a fan of Kristen Stewart (I blame Twilight series since I like most of the films otherwise). This was actually pretty good. A good story, good acting, and a great twist off of Snow White.
B001DDBCUA|5.0|Love this movie perfect to watch on a gloomy rainy stormy day., alone or with the girls over some wine and cheese
B00006CXXU|5.0|i consider it to be her best work.  It speaks to power to all women and do not allow to have your power that does not share your dreams.
0399255370|5.0|SUCH a cute book!  I highly recommend this to parents of pre-school and early elementary school students!  My daughter loves this story.  Very creative!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Thanks you so much, really a great product that just need more apps.  (for now only netflix, music and chrome from pc)
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|NEEDS DISCLOSURE: You neglected to mention that it was  not compatible with Windows Surface 2. As it, it's useless to me.
B00C2FFJFM|3.0|Being that it was her first solo album ( and probably the first disney didn't have a finger on ) it was good. Not my favorite album necessarily but not bad.
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|Even funner than the original. The re imagined Star Wars characters are so fun. What will they come up with next? Love it!
B00DQC2FPM|5.0|Well it is a about time Lego made an awesome set.  My son is obsessed with BTTF and this could not have come at a better time.  Excellent quality product.
0802473156|5.0|One of my favorite books. I recommend it to everyone and am constantly giving away &#34;my&#34; copies.<br /><br />Guess that's probably b/c my love language is GIFTS!!
B008602KQI|5.0|Love this movie, great representation of the book without confusing those who haven't read it.  Jennifer L. is a star, and I'm excited to see the next installment.
1427206465|5.0|Well written, educational and very profound!  Made me appreciate how blessed we are in American and what exceptional people there are all over the world.  We can learn so much from others.
B00DWZHTOU|5.0|So let me start this by saying I am thought this movie was just going to be a big name show where you've heard of the actors and actresses but there wasn't much of anything else. I was wrong. It had a plot, twists and turns to keep you guessing, humor at all the right spots and even a total unexpected ending.
B00AKOB7CG|5.0|this is a quick way to workout.  different apps to do on different days.  They are short and to the point.  I recommend putting music on while you do them.  They do work and are not boring because they are fairly quick to get thru.
B00CM03H4C|5.0|This is the best soundtrack ever!  Mostly remakes of previous awesome songs made to sound like 20's upbeat techno rap....or something like that.
B00E8S2KV2|5.0|It's the Hobbit and the extended version, too--what's not to love?  I also got my copy before my brother, and he had to ask to borrow mine 'cuz it wasn't available by the time he tried to order...  Ha!
B0000024YL|5.0|Most albums containing 10-12 songs I usually skip at least 4-5 songs. On this album I keep my finger off the buttons completely. Literally love half the songs and really like the other half.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I'm enjoying this on my Samsung Galaxy Tab. I originally put it on my Nexus 7 (2013) running kitkat, but it doesn't open on it. Hopefully it's just not optimized for kitkat yet.<br /><br />Update: I got through 8 of the 10 levels in an afternoon. One feature I'd like to see is the ability to resume play exactly where you leave off. As far as I can see, you can resume play at the last level you were on but only at the beginning of that level. For example, I almost completed level 9 when I had to stop. When I get back to it I will have to begin that level from the beginning. Luckily some of the information was written down.
B005LAIH2M|4.0|So going into this movie with my girlfriend dissing it before I had seen it, I like it. Lots of action, and humor in the right places. I didn't care much for the parts where you could tell it would be awesome in 3D but it didn't really take away from anything either.
B00A285OOW|3.0|THE WHITE PRINCESS<br /><br />Had the makings of an excellent work with regard to the subject matter. However, there were lengthy descriptions , slow moving segments and a lot of repetitive statements,
B0029XFN9O|5.0|This is one of my wife's favorite movies and we watch it several times every Christmas.  The stunts are fun, and it gets us in the Christmas mood.
B008602KQI|5.0|Very well told story and pretty close to the book.  Jennifer Lawrence is spectacular! can't wait for the next one!
0316055433|1.0|If you want to go out of you mind reading one description after another and another and another on and on and on until you want to bang your head against the wall or run screaming from the room, buy this book.  How can this author justify his monotonous droning, often in several languages and feel that he has written something people will enjoy.  I downloaded this book onto my iPad from my library and was never so happy in my life as when I delegated the wretched thing and returned it. Painfully awful, stupid, uninteresting, waste of time, THE GOLDFINCH.
0316069884|5.0|This is a great book with concise information about an industry kept hidden from the general public. Well done Foer!
1423140605|5.0|I've like the Percy Jackson novels for some time... The Heroes of Olympus is an interesting spin and sometime it is a bit hard to follow the different perspectives but it is still a great book.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Simple plug and play interface, started a little finicky, and sound can only come from TV (not sound system attached to TV) or sound will not work. But for $35, I'll take the tinny highs of my TV onboard sound.
B0073Q0DZG|5.0|With a great cast, beautiful scenery, and a good story, this movie really entertains!  It doesn't hurt that I am a bird enthusiast!
B0073CCYAM|1.0|The product details state:  4 x 3.9 x 6.1 inches ; 11.2 ounces<br />This car is smaller than a matchbox car.  This is not what I ordered.  I am very unhappy.  I'd like to return it.
B00936A0RU|5.0|This movie is a great one, Keeps you on edge until the end. Love the actors in it and the story line is very good. I loved the action scenes and there was occasional humor. I am buying this for my husband for Christmas. LOVE IT!!!!
B00A7W29BE|5.0|I love this app. You can can pictures of documents and receipts and turn them into searchable pdf documents. It's perfect for the busy professional on the go who doesn't have a scanner nearby, and doesn't like saving their receipts during business trips. Just click a pic, email yourself the pdf, and throw the receipt in the trash.
B008XNZMOU|4.0|While many of the songs are catchy I just like Speak Now a little better. Nothing against Taylor Swift or her fans.
B0018RWMNM|5.0|In my opinion this is one of the greatest westerns that I have ever had the pleasure of watching. Once you start watching for the first time or the tenth time, you are drawn in. Once I start it I cannot hardly get up from it. I laugh and cry and feel so connected to the characters. It draws on many emotions. To say it is well done is an understatement. The cast is wonderful. They draw from one another to create this masterpiece. It is on my top shelf. Many of my DVDs are setting where I put them when I purchased them. Not this one. No dust here.
B00009W0U4|3.0|it was a movie not a good one if you got epilepsy the colour in it is very bright I can not remind much about it was sum time ago
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|I love this movie!! Just got a new 3D LED TV and all I can say is WOW!! The movie itself was good, but the 3D version is incredible.

B000W91RUG|5.0|Cant wait to be able to watch the show in order - it's been catch as catch can on tv.
6304873441|4.0|I've always liked this movie with it's adorable little humorus bat. I know the movie isn't about the bat but I try not to spoil things.
B00ENXBUR2|5.0|I'm a really big fan of Superman. Im a geek and I have friends that are super geeks when it comes to the superhero movies, books, comics, etc. So we talk around the water cooler about all stuff superhero. You know with the release of this DVD we where gonna go crazy. I wasn't sure where I was gonna buy from, after all different stores have different promo's. Anyway I ran across this on Amazon and I hadn't seen this package before. It was right in the price range I was looking for so I went for it.<br />Let me tell ya, I was more than pleased. It came with all the disc's it said plus the case is metal and the plastic stand has magnets that hold it on pretty cool. Then I realized I also forgot it was a numbered limited edition cool too. Its not often you feel you get exactly if not more than what you paid for. In this case I definitely did. My friend purchased the set that had the toy figures for more money and I still think I got the better deal just for the fact the metal case and stand really show off well, his doesn't.
B00DNB9RXO|5.0|Naught is a game unlike anything I've ever played! The art is strange yet, beautiful. The music haunting yet, appropriate. There are 40 levels where you can choose to play in either Normal or, Hard Mode. You can also play the game in it's original all black & white theme or, Naught's new HD style. I prefer to play in HD Mode. In this mode, the majority of the artwork still remains black & white (including that cool-looking cat!); with the exception of one added solid splash of color that is used to 'highlight' Naught's underground tunnels. This solid color will change with each new level you achieve.<br />These options mentioned above can be found at the top of your screen after you've tapped \\"PLAY\\".<br /><br />I found Naught to be surprisingly addictive, albeit, a bit frustrating. But, not so much where I felt I wanted to quit or delete the game. I was actually having difficulty putting it down! Naught is most definitely worth checking out as the App of the Day. However, should you have missed out on grabbing this amazing game for free, then, I personally feel Naught is worth 2 or 3 times the asking price.<br /><br />Do you enjoy puzzle/physics & strategy-type games? Are you bored with all your hundreds of games that clutter your SD Card or Cloud? Are you been craving for something; anything!...new & so completely different that you'd be willing to dish out good money for it? If you answered 'YES' to just one of the above questions, then this is the game you've been searching for! And, for only $1, I HIGHLY recommend this incredible game! I had received Naught for free, however, I feel this game is worth 3 times as much if not more.<br />Seriously. It really IS that good!<br /><br />*Edited to correct the number of levels available. Also added miscellaneous information.
B00C5R7B0I|1.0|THIS BOOK WAS NOT AS GOOD AS PREVIOUS SCARPETTA  NOVELS.  IT SEEMED TO BE A LITTLE CHOPPY.  JUST WASN'T A GOOD READ FOR ME.
1451648537|5.0|Wonderful Book....He was a very intelligent Man, but on the other hand a very hard man to live with... Hope all is well with his siblings these days
B00BOUL9DM|4.0|because it is a game my grand daughter can use her brain, all the other ones are just crazy stupid games,  I wish they would come out with math games kids have fun doing. or if there is, I'd like to find it.  :-)
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I love chromecast!  The only thing I wish it did that it doesn't (yet) is amazon prime streaming.  No cable for 3 years running and this is the easiest and most reliable streaming I have done yet. The controls on the phone *sometimes* don't work like I'd want, a little laggy, but for the most part, awesome!
0545265355|5.0|I bought just Mockingjay at Barnes and Noble for 20 bucks. I got All 3 HARDCOVER in this for 19, delivered! Seriously unheard of. it says 56 dollar price on the box. Good stuff, how could I not be happy?
B0063GORYU|4.0|I enjoy playing Spider with cards and this way I can do it anywhere. It's a great way to pass the time
B006INDS0W|5.0|A very detailed movie with characters and meaning surrounding people with real problems and how they dealt with their problems.
B000065V3H|5.0|dumb but funny 80s movie, my favorite part is patrick dempsey doing his crazy african dance at the  high school dance
B0039W1J0Q|5.0|Dark and brilliant!  The music is top notch and Peter Gabriel's voice looms over the dark orchestra tones beautifully.  I love this evolution in his musical style.
B00EY7MFKS|5.0|Love the subtle tie-ins to the Marvel Universe Movies. There is great potential to expand the role of this series by giving origins of certain characters in the movies that have yet to be given.<br /><br />Though I give it five stars there is definitely room for improvement and, as the Marvel Movies expand the &#34;Universe&#34;, I am expecting this series to grow as well.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|I have been waiting so long for this app this game is like epic you will like it a lot.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|The art of Grisham is the character development and painting pictures with his words. I recently quit a book in the middle, which I have very rarely done. The reason I did was that I couldn't visualize the scenes or the characters. In Sycamore Row, I saw the town of Clanton, the coffee shop, Lettie's home, the courthouse,. I had a visual of Lucien, Jake, Carla, Portia, Lettie, Lanier, Seth's children etc.<br /><br />It also shows a powerful image of the old south, and there is a morality play unfolded.<br /><br />It made me look forward to each day's reading, with apprehension, anxiety and curiosity.
B00EVPSJOE|5.0|A great edition  If your a Eric Clapton fan, this is highly recommended  and it is at a good price.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Been using it for a few years... All thanks to Amazon's free app of the day program. Switched to iOS for a little while to try something different. Missed SwiftKey every time I typed. Back to Android and SwiftKey is even better!
0788859544|5.0|love this movie and so my girls! My oldest loves to dress up like Ariel and pretend play in the pool
B00F6Y3FKW|5.0|Good Deal on the non &#34;bootleg&#34; albums and the included book is well done.<br />The overall package is small which I consider a plus.<br />My &#34;Hard Rain&#34; disc was defective even though I ordered after the safe date.<br />Have not received the replacement yet, but the process to get one was painless.
B00GINENG0|5.0|It's so cute I love this game more than any other game I'd give 10 stars if I could reasons y u should get is.<br />1. Cute<br />2. Addictive<br />3. FREE<br />4. Better than any other game<br />5. Do I have to name anymore?<br /> JUST GET THE GAME!!
B004ADH1RI|5.0|I didn't read the description but it's a box set which is cool. I grow up watching these movies.. I think the 80's were a stress free time and just trying to do things that would help me not to stress. So I think good fun exciting funny movies is one of many to help with stress... Plus this movies is awesome...
B00ED2EMJQ|5.0|This is a great album. Anyone who is a fan of Alvin Lee will enjoy this concert. A must have.
B004SDEP38|5.0|Well, I haven't played with this app a whole lot, so I'll just preface my review with that right off the top. But in my experience, this app works just as well as the &#34;QuickOffice&#34; app which happens to be free. For most people to view Office documents, I think QuickOffice would be acceptable. However, if you're creating or doing any kind of major editing in Office on your android device, then I would probably recommend the full version of this app instead.
B00CTKHXFO|5.0|Every single MGS game in the series excluding RISING 10/10 story and gameplay The art book is also very lovely and shows off a lot of cool art.​
B000HT3PPG|5.0|What's not to like? This movie is a classic and should be shown to future generations to come. You have to &#34;believe.&#34;
B00FRQ32N4|3.0|It's a pretty good game I play it all the tome but it annoys me when it won't connect to Facebook every time I try to it starts to then it stops and won't connect
B00BAXFECK|5.0|This has become one of my favorite books next to To Kill a Mockingbird.  The writing is amazing.  I could not put it down.  I read it within two days because it was such a page turner.
B00D0SA8I8|4.0|Rating based on my opinion and product use. The rating needs to be a drop down only and not require someone to write an additional response. You will get better data with the multiple choice questions.
B009E3EYMY|5.0|It's LED ZEPPELIN!!! They Rocked it for being in there 60's!!!<br />Plant Hit Mark With His One Of A Kind Vocals, Page Made That Guitar Wicked and Heavy, John Paul Jones Always under Appreciated Hit Every Note, And Jason Made his Dad Proud!!!
030758836X|5.0|Such a great book. Kept you guessing.  Great character development. I will read everything this author writes.  From the beginning to the end, I was hooked.
B00BEK6Z7M|5.0|OMG what can I say...Agent Pendergast keeps me on my toes! I look forward to and pre-order these books as soon as I can. I can't put them down. The plots are suspenseful, complicated, mysterious and completely delicious. I recommend you read them all. It's best if you start from the beginning but I'm sure they'd be good in any order.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|Love this game ppl should really get this omg and the best is it is FREE and I get to my bffs
B00AJFEHAU|2.0|I was disappointed with this cd because there are only 4 songs on it. Not worth the price. In going to keep it because my daughter likes the group. I would not recommend it because it seems to not be worth the money.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Rating based on my opinion and product use. The rating needs to be a drop down only and not require someone to write an additional response. You will get better data with the multiple choice questions.
B00B7PIRIE|1.0|Discs were damaged and either caused the film to jump or stop. Will need to return to either get refund or receive set that is not damaged!
B000SGRONM|1.0|I didn't appreciate David Sedaris's humor. It was a book club selection therefore I didn't read any of the reviews before purchasing the book. IPS
B0090XLDKY|5.0|I grew up watching this movie and love owning it. It's a true classic and Debbie Reynolds, Gene Kelly and Donald O'Connor are beyond perfect. Extra features are fun to watch too.
B00FATEJYE|3.0|It is a fun game but it needs a story to link all the addictive, edge-of-your-seat tapping and swiping. Amazing graphics and they seemed to include all the more popular characters except Martian Manhunter.
0425221806|5.0|Probably the best book by Koontz that I have read.  Hard to put down.  Even the ending was good as I think many of his books do not end well.
048623231X|5.0|A great book of illustrations to bring Dante's Commedia to life. Dante's adventure comes to life and leaves the viewer contemplate, &#34;What if&#34;.
B000YHG72E|5.0|It's funny and not boring, it's silly without being insulting, yes I like whispering too, so I am going to whisper my appreciation right now. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,. There,all done.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Thoroughly enjoyable to play. Laughed at the well thought out antics of the minions as they interacted while playing. Alot of requests for money, the only downer.Good work from the developers. Two thumbs up.
B000HEWEJO|5.0|Most perfect Christmas movie of all time! Just watch it once and you'll be hooked. I've watched it at least twice every Christmas season for 28 years and it still brings tears to my eyes at the end.
B005H0IW6W|4.0|This CD is a gift for a friend, but I assume that it will work just fine because it is enclosed in a nice, unscratched case and in the plastic still. The only reason I gave this a 4 star was because it literally took 16 days to get here. I understand that it was ordered a week before Thanksgiving and with Christmas around the corner there were probably a high volume of orders, but that was still a bit of a wait and two days longer than the expected period.
B00DXP7L88|1.0|So, I love the Dexter series and I loved the actual final season.  The ending definitely could have been better but I'm not gonna ruin it for others who really want to watch it.  Here's the reason for the one star:<br /><br />As I watched the season, I kept feeding in the discs, wanting to watch til the very end.  I put the last disc in and all's i got was a &#34;DISC READ ERROR&#34;.  what?  So, I contacted Amazon and they promptly sent me a replacement.  I get the replacement in like two days, return the old one.  Pop the last disc in.  Same thing.  All other discs were fine but the final disc would not work in my dvd player.  I have an LG 3D Blu Ray player.  Never has a problem reading other discs so I'm not sure why this only disc just won't work.  I was able to get the last disc to play on my computer but that kind of sucked.  I wanted to watch it on my big flat screen just like the others.<br /><br />Just wanted others to know.  I have no idea why this is happening but it happened twice so I assume others may have the same trouble with the same model dvd player or maybe even just any blu ray or 3d blu ray?  Not sure.
B0044XRIMW|5.0|This is a classic.  We never tire of watching it.  The new dvd's have fixed the sound problems of the old VHS.
1451668945|5.0|I love Mary Higgins Clark. She writes the best mystery books. I have been reading her books since I was in the 8th grade, and that has been a long time. Her daughter Carol is excellent also.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I enjoyed this book emencly and I highly recommend it to all  !! Thank you,Stephen King, for giving  many of us some<br />closure.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game. It's really fun and entertaining, scrats mini game is fun without being too challenging. The tasks are fun and obtainable without being impossible to do. The animals are cool and my son loves being able to interact with his favorite animal's from the movies. So 5 stars and great work.
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|If you like Rod Stewart then you will love this album.  His songs are him through and through. It's great.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Great fun.... please increase the coins or decrease amt of time it takes to earn coins. 30 seconds Is tooooooooo long to wait!!!!. I want more, I want more:)
B000L53D4O|3.0|My one year old twins just aren't into this toy.  I'm not sure why.  I think I like it better than they do, and it isn't something I'm going to keep for very long.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Very challenging as you would find in a solitaire game and I like how there are hints if you get stuck.  The only gripe is there are advertisements, but that's minor.
B0002A2WDQ|5.0|I saw this video years ago, and had to have it for my collection. Great southern blues music. Good movie.
B00BEZTMFY|4.0|Fun movie. It's not like the book The Hobbit, which is a children's book. It's a new work intertextually inserted into The Hobbit, like Pride and Prejudice and Zombies. It has a lot of great fan service for adult fans of the Lord of the Rings movies.
B004MC0FO8|5.0|This is such a.cool app.  You do need to be connected wirelessly to use it.  I used it to identify commercial songs, a song on the radio, and much more.  I tried to trick it by Shazaming some songs on the Country Music Awards that were performed by another artist than Tim McGraw...and it identified the song from the CAN awards.<br />  Sometimes it will have the lyrics of the song, and it will give you options for buying the music or listening to it on other media.  It is fun.
B008GWP2GG|5.0|Very compelling story,the story is what keeps you glued to the movie.Great acting,a must see,a real gem,a must for UFO fans
B008602KQI|5.0|Solid adaptation of the book.  Jennifer Lawrence is great. They did a good job minimizing the violence, and concentrating on the characters.
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|This is my favourite game of all time!!! I have LOVED the graphics and everything in this game. The characters are cool, too!
B005K0HDGE|3.0|I found it to be a little slow.  Second half thankfully went quicker than the first.  I probably wouldn't have finished if it hadn't been a book club pick.  Some of those in the group loved it.  Others not at all.  I thought it was OK.
B0034G4P80|5.0|First, a word about my perspective. I am heathen rather than a Marvel fan. (I'm the author of Asatru For Beginners, so I am steeped in heathenry.) There were things in this movie that drove me batty until I got used to them. For example: the idea that Thor's father made him human and sent him to Earth, which essentially turns him into a Christ figure, is a bit sacrilegious even from a Christian perpective, let alone an Asatru one.  The shirt-free scenes are clearly meant to invite thinking of Thor as a sex object, which is a bit easier to swallow. Pardon the pun. He acts like a clueless relic of the Viking Age, unfamiliar with cars and tasers, but speaks modern English (the archaic semi-Shakespearean diction is in no wise what someone who hasn't been back to Earth since the days of Ragnar Lothbrok would use.) Not to mention the Mary-Sueish human heroine, when we all know Thor is married to Sif. I found it all a bit shocking in the theater -- I mean, these are our gods, after all -- but the story grew on me, and now that I've seen it again in my living room I can't help but love it to death.<br /><br />Thor himself must love it, too, or at least love that Americans honored him with a movie and little children are calling his name. And people are sacrificing coffee to him instead of goats. Which is a lot less messy. When this movie was in the theaters, it rained a LOT that summer. Now there is another Thor movie in the theaters (The Dark World) and again it rained a LOT this summer. So he must approve.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|I  REALLY LIKE this app.  I was having trouble finding the downloads on my Kindle HD.  I can just pull this app up, go to the download file and access this file.  I had downloaded certain files a couple of times thinking that the file hadn't downloaded.  I was able to delete downloaded files I didn't need and free up space on my Kindle.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Fun. Game is ready when you can play. No expiration times on the items you are making. Quick play and addictive!
0694003611|5.0|Such a cute book. Goodnight Moon is a nice story to read at bedtime. Bought it for my granddaughter for Christmas. It's made of heavy board for small children.
B00F2362IE|1.0|this game crashes every time I play it either that or it gets stuck on the loading screen and I have to restart my kindle.
B00BKZUVGM|5.0|this is a great book so very interesting i really liked it hope theres more to come from veronica roth!
B000LB7G00|5.0|Awesome with my CadCam Design Center!  Every E4D Dentist should have one of these.  I placed on my Design Cart with Bite Registration material, hasn't moved in 3 years.
B008FRFN7A|5.0|I have a HP 6500a wireless all-in-one printer.  I downloaded this app and was totally amazed when it printed a downloaded item from my Kindle HD.  I am working with my email and other apps to figure out how to print from them.  I am so excited to not have to turn on my computer to quickly print something I can print off my Kindle.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|So much for so little!!!  This will be your go to device for all movie watching experience.  You will enjoy the easy to install and set, that's it.
B003B02O0A|5.0|I loved it. I couldn't wait to find out what happens. What a spine tingling awesome story. Thank you, John Grisham
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|I paid for it but I couldn't even watch it, it said play back not available try again later, so I. Watched it somewhere else. I want my money back!
B001OQCV6A|5.0|The product is as advertised . I do not expect any more I do not expect any less. It seems to be a good product.
B008FPOIT6|3.0|The plot is just too preposterous. I like this writer's humor and style but he would be better served if he wrote something more realistic.
B00CGPPMKU|5.0|I like this app.  It takes me to the creative side of my brain and it is very relaxing.  I can also share and save the pictures I draw.  I am going to use one picture on some business cards I am making.  It would be neat to use as a card design also.  I have a friend who is an artist and she was impressed with a horse head and flowers I drew.  It is fun.
B007PVHMCG|2.0|So my son really wanted this and I bought it for him. It is sooo tiny and small. For this size of a lego set I would expect to pay less then $20 bucks but with shipping and tax it was practically $50!!! So not worth it to me. And we are major Lego connoisseurs! But he loves it so I guess it's ok.. that makes up for the fact that it was way too much $$ for such a small lego set.
031250926X|5.0|I love the peek-a-boo part on every page.  You slide the text over to see what the upcoming animal will be.  One of the bigger board book dimensions I've seen.
0385537131|5.0|Grisham does it again & again - great sequel to an already outstanding book.<br /> I have every book John Grisham has written and this is near the top of my list!
6303314015|5.0|The product is as advertised . I do not expect any more I do not expect any less. It seems to be a good product.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Another well written legal thriller by Mr. Grisham. He gets better every book and I look forward to his next issue.
B0062NAVXA|5.0|i just loved it. It really makes a person stop and think about the values one has. You should get it!
B00GSAC1UI|5.0|It is Pentatonix. If you know who they are you know how talented they are and how wonderful they sound. This album is a wonderful collection of christmas music done in Pentatonix's style. A must buy.
B005LAIIN0|4.0|Love this movie, suspenseful and fast paced. Thought Brad Pitt did a credible job in his role, need more movies like this.
B003PBB4ME|4.0|Good quality little piece of gear. Make sure your camera fits, though. I know some people have issues because the gap between the platform and the handle is pretty small. I use a 7D and have used it with the 5D with no problems. Great for getting low steady shots.
B0091VYG86|5.0|Refreshing look at what shaped our past.  It is always fun to say in my day, but as this movie points out, every generation had its share of stress.
B00DEFW998|5.0|I love this CD, the songs are beautiful and I don't tire of hearing them.  I especially like the ones with Nora Jones.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|My second grader just loved this and other of Jeff's books on the Wimpy Kid. Keep them coming so he can enjoy more.
B0028K31CE|5.0|Greatest.... Can't get enough of Maxwell. I still had faith he'd deliver something to my taste after taking time away & I was right. Never fails. He will always be a great artist. Songs were good, voice was great. Baby maker hit... Must have if you dig smooth neosoul
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Alot of people didn't like the third book, maybe because it didnt end like a fairy tale but I thought it was a good, believable ending.
B003ZLV8T8|5.0|Very easy to watch, relaxing movie. Actors did a fantastic job. Highly recommend if you need to wind down :) Enjoy!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|At first the game was hard,but after you beat it a couple times it is easy. I really like it.
0762449306|5.0|This is a very cute little Tardis.  I love the little light on top. It is perfect for my work desk.
B000AYEL6U|3.0|love the movie seen it before how ever there are to many episodes missing like when the riot comes and she gets hit with the rock and like second disk is missing  several so upset very disappointed  I do hope my other movies I ordered are all there  the movie makes no sense with out all episodes
0307352153|5.0|Well written and well researched.  Very reaffirming for an introverted person!!  Helps in understanding personality types.  Would recommend to extroverts as well!
B0090SI582|3.0|If you thought that Iron man 3 was a little boring and missed its mark then you will think this one does too. The movie had many chances to shine and just kept falling short.<br /><br />Three biggest complaints:<br />1. Wolverine shirtless for the majority of the movie gets old.<br />2. The alternate ending should have been the scene right before the ninjas.<br />3. We only care about internal dualism in an action movie when there is action.<br /><br />Origins was lame and cheesy but a better movie than this.
B00DMXJC56|5.0|Fantastic music -- good sound and no problems buying digitally. I love their rock/blues sound and her voice. Can't wait for their next album
B00BEK6Z7M|5.0|Preston & Child have done it again. I really enjoy reading their books and Pendergast is one in a million!!
B000JQV68A|3.0|The book was well written but none of the characters was sympathetic so I did not care one wit what happened to them.
B0081SRJSY|5.0|I have the board game.  Very well translated to the mobile (using Nexus 7).  Need to try the wifi multiplyaer option.  Kids and adults will like it.  AI is a bit soft, but otherwise a perfect translation.
B004EPYZQ2|5.0|This movie was a splendid surprise. The children did a remarkable job and the story drew you in. A must watch.
006202406X|4.0|Insurgent left us with a broken Tris and with a curiosity of what lay beyond the fence. The whole base of the faction society is in question and Tris is one of the few who is willing to get to the bottom of things, no matter the cost.<br /><br /> Honestly, I mentally prepared myself for Allegiant weeks before I read it. Everyone in the Divergent fandom pretty much heard that the ending was basically going to blow you out of the water. Then, to add to it all, there was the hype of Four also narrating. It's pretty easy to say that expectations were very high.<br /><br /> Tris and Four each took turns narrating for us, and after reading The Transfer, I was really excited. Four's voice was completely different from Tris's in the latter. However, in Allegiant the first or second POV changes were fine, Four's voice was just as I remembered. But after the third or fourth time, their voices just started blending together. So that was a bit of a let down.<br /><br /> The plot was.... not expected but not unexpected either. For me, some of the magic was kind of lost when Tris and Four go beyond the fence and learn the truth. At that point, it was just the work and world building from the previous two books that kept Allegiant from feeling just like every other dystopian out there. Don't get me wrong, it was different but also a bit similar. Then there's the fact that Four is a freakin' hypocrite. He and Tris promise (again) to be honest, and he goes off in the night, learns something important, and doesn't tell her when he should. Four was... frustrating.<br /><br /> As for Tris, I loved her. She really grew. I do feel that her recovery from all of the emotional trauma suffered in Insurgent was a bit rushed. But Tris returned as a strong and more honest character in Allegiant. And I would say, finished her journey and fulfilled purpose.<br /><br /> The ending was the most traumatic thing I have ever read. I was trying not to cry for the last sixty or so pages. I know some people were angry but that wasn't my reaction at all. I'll admit that I wish things hadn't ended the way they did. It definitely wasn't the ending I wanted. But Miss Roth handled it all very well if you ask me. Now that its been a few weeks since I finished, I see the symbolism behind this traumatic event. It brought this character full circle. Literally.<br /><br /> All in all, it was a great book but it wasn't the ending I wanted. All things considered, Miss Roth tied everything up pretty nicely. I commend her for daring to write the ending she wanted and saw instead of the ending readers would have dictated.ple were angry but that wasn't my reaction at all.

B00D48BT5A|4.0|An interesting read, well researched as always but in content and exposition not really one of his best. Primarily for the sport and historically minded American audience. The problem with being Bill Bryson is that we expect a level of excellance beyond that achieved by mere mortal authors which is, of course, grossly unfair.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Oh how lovely this book was. If only so many people hadn't died ( or been obliterated ). I'd recommend this definitely. An amazing end to a beautiful series !
B000JMKQX0|4.0|I really enjoyed the writing- the antagonist in the story could have been anything- aliens, zombies, flu pandemic- open to the imagination. The interview/ mulitple POV style of the story worked well here, unlike in Allegiant by Veronica Roth.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|3D for this movie is the only way to go. We had purchased the Blue-Ray/DVD, repackaged it and gave it away as a gift and purchased the 3D package. Glad we did !!
B000FBHC7S|5.0|ONLY THE DARKEST, DOOMIEST BONGHITS FROM THE ASTRAL PLAN EMIT FROM THIS CURSED DISC. BE WARY, FOR IF YOU LISTEN TOO LONG TO THESE DARK, SLUDGY SONGS, YOUR SOUL MAY FOREVER BE DEEMED AWESOME
B00881VLCE|4.0|This is for people who don't have the room for puzzles but, enjoy them just the same.  Same type of interactive play, less space, less time. Awesome!
B00FATEJYE|5.0|Excellent mobile version.  Simple and easy to learn, but still fun.  A must have for any one who it's addicted to the console version.  Looks great too!
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|I had a little kid show me this game. I am so hooked on this one. Great game. I just can't stop playing.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I thought it was a fun game but I wish u could create your own career though other than that it was good
0307346617|5.0|Awesome book! Written from the perspectives of different characters around the world. It's an exciting read and one of the best zombie apocalypse written so far. Much like \\"The Walking Dead\\", it sets the bar higher than most other Zombie books I have read.
B00ANAC32U|2.0|Bought this case and while inserting the phone, the case broke from the connector part in about 2 months new.
1451666179|5.0|This is a wonderful book. Very funny! It also has some wisdom to impart concerning the author's trip through depression. It shares her story in a charming, insightful way.  It's definitely worth a read!
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Not to bad of a game. It fills the the rainy day and doesn't take to much effort. Recommend for any one who is bored lol
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|I loved it...character development and great story line.  ai feel like I know the people  and can identify either by experience or by a friend.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Very well done.  Jessica Lange is at her best! The stories are very dark,but the writing and acting is television at its best.
B00D48BT5A|4.0|Great style of Bryson once again. He takes you along on the journey of learning something about the human race and making you smile too. If you liked his &#34;At Home&#34; book then this is another good read.
B006BDHAX0|4.0|Love the game, definitely worth the .99. The HD is awesome and its fun and easy to play! If you're a mahjong lover this game is the game for you
B00G4I1CLS|5.0|This movie does a good job of exposing a side of an industry people rarely consider. Definitely worth watching if your interested in seeing how whales are really treated at sea world.
B00GOZQ2E8|5.0|The characters and towns people say funny things, you can customize heroes...all out well done. The graphics are nice, you can choose from a bunch of looks and hair styles you don't have to pay for. Its nice that the makers aren't greedy. And the monsters are really creative and cool.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|Easy, fun. Pay to get stars to get unlocks quicker but generally decent play. Recommend but need WiFi to play no offline mode
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so very adicting I even play it every day. It is the perfect game for a kid. So you should get this game for your kid.
1451662432|5.0|An absolutley incredble read. Arnold is a complete role model and his life story is tuly inspiring. It helped motivate me to get in better shape and persue larger life goals. His politcal section drags a bit but then still leaves great life examples. It's hard to think of an indiidual whom has acheived more from less or is more motivated than Arnold.

B00G70K1HY|3.0|They make this great history in the comic into a blah! Movie, is not good, is not bad is just an OK movie and for this character is a big disappointment because he deserve more, they could it show him as a more vulnerable character but they show this thug that has lost some of his powers and he fights to get thru but he never shows that side I wanted, I was cursed with this but I was a human once and I don't want this anymore but I'll accept this to be my destiny and want him to go thru each of this faces. They try to do it but they didn't succeed at least I didn't felt it  sorry disappointing

B004GYY714|4.0|Great radio app, turn on separate radios much less now! Centralizing all external sensory data in one location, bad news if kindle falls apart...
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Two big issues not mentioned amongst all the positive advertising...<br /><br />1) very dependent on your wifi router.  We had to buy a new one to make this work.  Big hidden expense there.  (And do you have any idea how hard it is nowadays to find any wifi router that doesn't have a backdoor???  It seems like every brand has some device that's been compromised.)<br /><br />2) barely supported by iOS.  On my iphone the only app with Chromecast support was Youtube; even Chrome itself didn't support Chromecast.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|Fun game just got it enjoying it so far!! See how it goes from here w guy ended other stuff opens up

B008Q00OZM|5.0|Galaxy Quest is a fun nod to Star Trek. very funny and definitely silly at times. Tim Allen is good as always, Love Sigourney Weaver and the rest of the cast. just a fun, silly enjoyable movie.
B0087FMUCQ|3.0|Not bad<br />First game I bought on kindle and again I think the best thing I can say is not bad
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|minons are the best part of the hole game. You can buy different minons like Bedo.Minons are amazing.I recamind this game for every kid.

B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is so much fun and even a little endearing!..due to the game bringing back memories of playing it at the fair!! :)<br />My Aunt introduced this game to me at the fair. I never understood what exactly the game was and why people'd stand around and play it so much - for long periods of time. But once I walked up and played with my Aunt's urging, I found myself immediately addicted! The fair isn't always around - plus, I'm going through a lot of medical stuff, so it helps burn up time while keeping my spirits up.<br />The game does take a little finesse, and in the beginning it may take some time to regenerate coins, but overall Tons of fun! And if you've ever played it at the fair, it will bring back those good competitive vibes and memories!
B000BVMAJ2|5.0|My boys loves animals. They loves lego duplo and have a big box of them. But they have others series of duplo, I am not keen on buying them the complete set of duplo zoo. So, I am so happy to find this model.. it's reasonable price and we got the animals :)
B00EJX2YGM|5.0|My girls will be so excited when they see they have the set for Christmas!  Bonus is that I get to watch them too.  :')
B008602KQI|5.0|This may be a movie and story for &#34;young adults&#34;, but it is an INCREDIBLE movie, IMHO, about the human spirit and the truth about our world. It is, has been, and ever shall be a struggle by the have-nots against the haves.<br /><br />This is a story of REVOLUTION!
B009UX2YAC|2.0|It's okay<br /> I liked but it will be cool if it can change your clothes to other glasses, hat, shirt, pants, shoes
B00BAXFECK|3.0|Good story particularly the beginning, rambles in the middle, and is very philosophical in conclusion. I would still recommend it.
B00BAXFECK|2.0|This novel made me very uneasy.  I don't believe that the main character was developed properly in the beginning.  As the book progressed, it lost it's impact and probably it's readers.  The story line was a good one, but the details of thoughts and descriptions didn't all add to the story. The  areas dealing with all of the drugs and alcohol were too graphic for me and, also, seemed to be too commonplace which was very disturbing to me.
B00785P2QC|3.0|I'm only writing this review so I can earn points so it's probably pretty boring; but I do hate that it doesn't show how much a building upgrade is!
B008HK3TXK|4.0|Good quality. Easy to fit around the Kindle. Not as elegant as the Verso cover I have on another Kindle but I got this one for a great price.
1908117230|4.0|Not only are Pierre Herme's macarons visually appealing, but the instructions that come with this book are very well detailed. Before I bought this book, I've made macarons a handful of times already. But, the version of macarons I have been making were with a French meringue rather than an Italian meringue (which is the only type of meringue they use in this book). The French method requires NO cooking of the sugar, thus making it easier to make. Pierre Herme uses the Italian version which requires cooking the sugar and pouring it into your egg white mixture. I was a little apprehensive buying this book because of the version they use, but if you are even slightly familiar with making macarons the French way, I am pretty sure you can do it the Italian way. The difference - taste-wise - is that I feel the Italian meringue is a bit sweeter than the French meringue. BUT, I did notice that I've had better results using the Italian meringue more so than the French meringue. Also, if you love everything perfect with the measurements and temperatures, the Italian version is for you. You do need to buy a thermometer that can be placed in your pot as you cook the sugar to prevent overcooking. I recommend buying a digital thermometer so you can get the exact temperature rather than &#34;guessing&#34; on a candy thermometer.<br /><br />The only reason I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the ingredients they use in this book. Most of the ingredients used is of the HIGHEST quality. I mean spending more than $8 on a bar of chocolate and also very specific ingredients (e.g., 85% cacao). But, if you don't mind about the price, then by all means...this book is for you. Now you know why these little cookies are so expensive at bakeries (the time and money that goes into them). But for those of you who live on a budget (like I do), it's quite difficult finding an alternative, especially if you don't want to mess up the macaron by being cheap.<br /><br />If you do end upfailing on making one of the hardest petit fours in the world, don't worry. This book may be expensive, but it's also a good coffee table book :)
B00C5R7B0I|1.0|Is there a reason to finish this endless tome? I have never been bored by a Scarpetta book but this one is dismal. Half way through and even Lucy is boring! Marino is whining, Benton is typically taciturn and Kay is turning into a damsel.  And really, putting Newtown into the book? What a cheap pandering tactic! Not sure if I will bother to finish...Cornwell has finally made me not care about her characters at all. Too bad.
B00F031X62|5.0|Jimi could do no wrong---even though his \\"sister\\" puts these gems out periodically (and his brother Leon gets nothing), it's GREAT to hear THE rock virtuoso in action, loud and clear! He still sets the standard, period.
B00DNB9RXO|1.0|This has got to be one of the most useless games I've downloaded in a while. Bad graphics, black &amp; white, and frustrating UI all combine to make this a real loser!
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|I love this app. I use the memory boost and clean files options every time I feel my Kindle get sluggish, and sometimes-  just because... There is always a positive response.
B005HSG3TC|4.0|While it says light… it's not all the light… but it sure protects the kindle… It also can be tilted to watch movies.  It could be a bit lighter.
B00BEK6Z7M|5.0|I love the Agent Pendergast character, but like Sherlock Holmes, he's more fun when he's a little aloof from the main story. In the last several Pendergast books, the story has revolved around the agent way to much.<br /><br />White Fire brings back Corey Swanson from Still Life With Crows. While this isn't really a sequel, it's more of a continuation of Corey's story. I definitely prefer these interwoven Pendergast novels, where past characters pop up to the ones digging into Pendergast's past. I think the character needs some mystery.<br /><br />In White Fire we get a double bonus, a great Pendergast book AND a 'lost' Sherlock Holmes story woven into the narrative. I'm not sure that it gets much better than that.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|Amazing the graphics are so real and the game is easy to use so many characters to collect. Buy it now
B00EVW0SA0|1.0|I thought Die Hard was fake until I saw this movie. Completely ridiculous. At least they put money into the special effects.
B002ZG97EC|5.0|The Despicabe Me move is one of my favorite of all the cartoon movies that have been released, great movie!
0440246318|1.0|The weakest Reacher yet.  No action until the end of the book.  Lots of unanswered questions and a completely implausible and foggy climax.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I miss Grisham's old stuff. While his latest stories were entertaining, I missed some of the character development of his early stuff. I confess to thoroughly enjoying A Time to Kill with it sometimes meandering views of rural Mississippi combined with deep dives into the law. Grisham is back with Sycamore Row and so are the characters from A Time to Kill. Sycamore Row was not a disappointment. The story is rich and full of small town idiosyncrasies.<br /><br />Grisham manages to avoid another murder trial. This time the intrigue comes from a nasty probate fight, and in that, he delivers a book that I simply couldn't put down.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|I love this game.first alot of heroes and villains nice graphics heros and stuff could be easier please put multiplayer but that's it overall EPIC game
B004VMUS9G|4.0|It does everything  I need it to do. It works quite well for a free app. It has an alarm clock, a timer and a stop watch so I don't have to go elsewhere for those things.
B00275EHJQ|5.0|What has not been said about the Toy Story series.  My kids like the movie and so do I, they are great to sit down when you just want a good old cartoon that can entertain both young and older kids.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I recently purchased a Google Chromecast device for my techie boyfriend and I wanted to share his findings and thoughts.<br /><br />The challenge of getting audio and video from a computer to a monitor has always required specialized cabling with length limitations, and the challenges are even greater with tablets and smart devices.  However, if a reliable 802.11g wireless connection is available, the Chromecast device becomes a component of your network, the wireless signal becomes your cabling, and certain devices on the network become Chromecast aware, capable of handing off the job of displaying a/v content from the computer monitor to the HDMI-capable TV.<br /><br />Currently, Netflix and YouTube are the only services that are Chromecast-ready, but I’m betting more will jump on the bandwagon.  However, running the Chrome browser and selecting to Chromecast a specific tab works incredibly well.  I’m watching and listening to Tom Petty videos as I type, and there’s zero choppiness or buffering.  Excellent quality requires excellent wireless, which I have here.<br /><br />For only $35, this device is awesome, and should be a part of anybody’s wireless network.  It could be used for any situation that requires displaying audio and video to one or more flat panel TV monitors.  Imagine the possibilities, the ease of implementing this technology, and the affordability!!  Add a couple inexpensive IP surveillance cameras and you would have a surveillance system that can be watched wirelessly on TV or computer.<br /><br />I would give this device more than five stars if I could!  Totally recommended.
160774273X|5.0|Great book with explicit, can't fail details.  Did a taste test against the old favorite no-knead bread recipe, and the Forkish way is a clear winner.  With pizzas, however, I like to make mine bigger than he specs.  When doing so, the center of the crust doesn't quite cook enough, so I recommend doing a pre-bake of the crust, then flipping it over and topping it before putting back into the oven.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Great in Grisham terms, still set in rural Mississippi, only thing I'd like to say is Lettie get your paper girl.
1455521310|3.0|Fairly predictable and lacking the usual zip found in Baldacci stories. A good book for a cold night in Minnesota
0151001820|4.0|Arturo Perez-Reverte, The Club Dumas (Harcourt Brace, 1993)<br />[originally posted 11Oct2000]<br /><br />Having now read this, I wonder if those who didn't like The Ninth Gate had already read the book before seeing the movie. Where Polanski took the low road and created a piece of comedic silliness centering around a book capable of raising the devil, Perez-Reverte actually wrote a stylish, low-key drama about an attempt to authenticate a chapter of The Three Musketeers. While the word &#34;panache&#34; tends to be horribly overused, that's the best way I can describe it. Perez-Reverte uses some of the conventions of the serial novel even as he makes fun of them, but he does so in such a way that the reader is still bowled over. (For those who have read the book, the last paragraph of Chapter 13 is the perfect example of what I'm talking about here.)<br /><br />The plot twists keep the pages turning even while Perez-Reverte's poetic style demands a leisurely pace. The perfect combination. ****
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|I can't give Chromecast a good review because it is not compatible with any of my devices.<br /><br />Just so you don't make my mistake: Chromecast only works with the newest tablets, PCs and TVs. My Samsung tablet is 2 years old, but not compatible.<br /><br />Here are some Chromecast specs to consider before you buy:<br />- Your PC/laptop must be running Windows 7 or newer.<br />- Your TV must have an available HDMI port.<br />- Your smartphone/tablet needs to be Android 2.3+<br />- It is not compatible with Kindle devices.<br />- The player is powered by USB, so your TV needs a USB port or an electrical outlet for the USB adaptor (included with Chromecast).
B0017MO10U|5.0|You have to be a Stargate fan to understand, if you are not, give it a try you might like it.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This is a no brainer. Was able to install quickly with no issues. Immediately after I installed this thing, my brother sent me a YouTube link via text. I was able to immediate view it on my big screen television. Will only get better with time.
B004VFK5LO|2.0|Copycat (Jon Amiel, 1995)<br />[originally posted 22Oct2000]<br /><br />Copycat is by far Jon Amiel's finest moment as a director. That's not saying much. Simple plot—police<br />on the trail of a serial killer—with a few monkeywrenches in the works (the Brilliant Psychiatrist Who Helps The Cops&#60;TM&#62; is housebound, the Evil Serial Killer&#60;TM&#62; is smarter than the average bear). That's not enough to turn this into another Silence of the Lambs, however. Had Amiel and scriptwriter Ann Biderman spent a bit more time developing their characters, this might have been a flawless film. Given that Biderman, a year later, was responsible for Primal Fear, she seems to have learned from her mistakes. **
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|My whole family loves this game.  We have it on every phone, Ipad, and kindle that we own.  Warning:  very addictive!!
B00EHZUQ1W|2.0|Great concert, excellent picture, very poor audio. Devin Townsend's voice can barely be heard in the rock tracks. Only stereo option available. Big shame because the concert is a beauty.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|must read, I could simply put not put this book down.  every emotion the characters resonated with me. cheers John Green
B009EEFTMC|5.0|This is a fantastic &#34;mindless&#34; game to get lost in. I've spent a lot of hours trying to beat my times!
B000Z8GZYW|5.0|Got this for Christmas for the family.  A fun movie I think my kids will like.  Love Bill Murray! Good buy.
B00FTGYNUS|3.0|The first few tracks are shot with cameras whirling around until you feel dizzy!  When I buy a DVD, I want to see the artist, not up the nostrils of the backup singers or the whirling leg of a dancer.  Once the camera work settled down, the rest of the concert was pure Pink and superb!<br />When will the people who make DVD's realise that it is not an open invitation for them to do weird angle shots and strange vision.  We want to see the concert as it was!
B00CHVJI08|5.0|Saw this movie at the theater and absolutely loved it!  One of the characters in it is absolutely delightful! Da ta da da!!! I bought this one for my nephew and can't wait to watch it with him!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|What a way to keep readers engaged. The husband's secret is one of the best books I've read. Can't wait to read her next one.
B00164GDD2|5.0|Loved this movie back in the day.  Bought it for my 3 daughters for Christmas.  Can't wait to watch it with them!
B003H4I4JU|3.0|This work by Mr. Cord was very hard to get into.  The background information was voluminous.  Very slow start.  Once you get into it (about halfway) it gets better.  I still had a hard time keeping all the characters straight.  Jumping 3000 years ahead was quite an achievement in itself.  The focus of this novel leaves Ender and focuses on who Ender is helping with his &#34;speaking for the dead&#34;.  I had thought that I might continue with the series, but I feel that this novel was written for a teenage audience.  I have moved on to the Kyle Swanson novels.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|to let everybody with face book or not with face book to have 50 pawer up's or I will distroy you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|It's a very fun game. Makes it hard to get anything productive done. Glad it's on Kindle. When you coming to Windows phone?
B008JFUPK8|3.0|The Blu-ray is good. Quality is really good.  Can't speak for the 3D version because I don't have 3D TV.<br /><br />As for the movie itself, I won't bother with a film review other than to say the acting is good (really good, actually) and the effects are good.  The script however, is pretty bad.  So just concentrate on the flashy and pretty things on the screen and try not to actually think about how what's happening makes no sense whatsoever and you'll be fine.
B005GY0Y8S|4.0|A sister goes to France to identify her sister's body and find the niece she didn't know she had. Only a unique bracelet led her to I'd the body.  She paid a man, who claimed to know the child's father, a large sum to help find the niece. Another man kept. The apsis tear busy during the search. Maggir, the sister,fell in love with the Frenchman Lauriet.  After returning the &#34;dead&#34; sister turns up alive.  Before the parents are told, she is murdered in Maggie's apartment.  The rest of the story is Maggie's  search for the killer I the U.S. And France and  falling more deeply. In love with her Frenchman.  the killer is  is a real surprise!
B009JBZH54|5.0|All great movies but this box set is extra amazing with the additional things that add to it, with the pictures and cut scenes.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I would not want to see this movie as it seems impossible to portray the beauty inside the hearts and minds of the characters on Himmel Strasse in Nazi Germany. Loved the unique perspective and original use of metaphor in this story. As a teacher, I will definitely use this book to teach literature in the future.
B001NA2NM4|5.0|I saw sculptures that I loved at an art show. When I asked the artist, Thomas Kuebler, about his inspiration for some of his work, he told me about the movie Freaks. Fantastic show.
B008JFUO4U|4.0|If you like sci-fi, you'll like this movie. The soundtrack is worth a view if nothing else! It was shot in Iceland (I believe) and is piled full of gorgeous scenery. It's also a cool story and well executed.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|Felt like this season dragged at times and started to bore me. Then about halfway through the season it picks up and starts to spark my interest.
B0051UP5NQ|3.0|It's not allowing me to do everything from Word.  I'm gonna buy a wireless mouse and see if that helps.
B00DNB9RXO|3.0|There is no doubt that this game has some 'original' unique graphics and game-play tactics. This also means unlike most other 'side-scrolling' types of game in this game you *MUST* have to learn to get used to the controls and screen orientation. This game offers three different types of controls at start of each level. I personally like using 'button controls' as this gives you some steady perspective as you progress thru' each level by holding the device upright but still at times I feel disoriented and frustrated.<br /><br />The addicting part is to collect and finish viewing the comic pages that gets unlocked as you progress into the game. So far the story-line seems interesting. I am not sure about the replay value once the full comic pages are read. But overall it is frustratingly addictive.<br /><br />- 3 stars!
B00A757EFW|5.0|Always loved Pac Man and Ms. Pac Man,  Got on now hopefully the other will be an ap.  I look forward to it.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Really enjoy the google chromecast I use the most to stream movies from my tablet to my tv and on top of that I watch a lot if YouTube videos that I'm able to stream.
B006362ZR6|4.0|Although I love the earlier CD's by THE FRAY more, I still like and enjoy listening to THE FRAY's Album SCARS & STORIES.  If you enjoy THE FRAY, you will enjoy this latest addition.  I received it on time and in great condition.
1401923127|5.0|I purchased this book a very long time ago and have put it in storage for when I have my library.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Facebook is always great.  It is a great social ap and has many people communicating and reconnecting with one another.
B00F91G5BS|4.0|Liked this movie much different from other zombie movies and has a lot of unexpected scenes. Seemed to be missing a little at the end.
B00FDSUJ0A|5.0|This CD is better than their first. The songs are incredibly catchy and half them you cant help but dance to. This cd has a completely unique sound. It blends their first album, &#34;A fever you cant sweat out&#34; and their second &#34;Pretty Odd.&#34; perfectly. The result is quirky but catchy songs
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Awesome just to much scenery details other than th<br />At very interesting book!  Love katniss! Very romantic love hunger games!
B0055SWM08|5.0|2 thumbs up waayy up!! Loads of fun a must have for puzzle lovers  in thebentire planet!!<br />And I have too keep talking.?.get it now!!!
B003B02PEU|5.0|Very colorful.<br />Couldn't  put it down.<br />A good read of the south and it's history.<br />A must read.<br />Love it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|been waiting for this game to be on the kindle.  it is highly addictive ...highly frustrating ...but a lot of fun.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Very fun and interesting game to play.  Purchased it yesterday for my Kindle Fire HD.  I showed it to my husband and he wouldn't give it back, he enjoyed it so much.  It's easy to learn and fun to play.  No surprises here or requests to purchase lives or credits or boosters (glaring at candy crush saga).  Great game and way to pass the time while waiting (for whatever reason).  Recommend this game highly.
B000UVT3OI|5.0|Arrived perfect condition as described and it a great sound for Country. I am so into Country music now that I live in the South
B00594XOZU|5.0|it is sooooooo cool you have to login when you first get it bet after that you are logdin forever
B00F91SCXC|3.0|Would be 4 stars but the story line sucked. Brad Pitt as a united nations special agent. Whats that? Everyone knows that the UN is a tool of the NWO, so probably they should be the number one suspect not the hero's of the story.<br />The CGI special effects were awsome, but some details like switching scenes between a C-130 Hercules transport and an AN 12 Russian aircraft was a little sloppy continuity wise.<br /> I liked the zombie transformation from infection within 12 seconds. Fast moving zombies are another reason to watch this.<br />3 1/2 stars
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I finally finished it...excellent read....love what kind of adult Danny Torrance became ....and will never look at those senior citizens in Winnebagos the same again!
B008Q09K2U|5.0|The Panther is a straightforward story with John Corey and his colleague and wife Kate from the Antiterrorist Task Force travelling to Yemen to find the man nicknamed The Panther who masterminded the bombing of USS Cole and killing American servicemen.<br />They are going from Yemen's capital Sana'a with the CIA officer and a few US Embassy people to a remote place in that country where The Panther is hiding in an Al Qaeda camp.<br />The story is so wonderfully written that I had a feeling that I was travelling with those people seeing that strange and frightening country - Yemen - through their eyes.<br />I love  John Corey and his acerbic humor and read all of Nelson DeMille other novels but The Panther is one of the best, probably, it is one of the best books I read over the long time, giving the reader the feel of Yemen, its desperation, cruelty and hopelessness, seeing it through eyes of Americans who are absolutely committed to find and destroy The Panther.<br />The tense story rolls on to an unexpected end with cold-blooded betrayal and  justice delivered.<br /><br />I will wait for another John Corey novel where he and his friend Paul Brenner will find and deal with Buck Harris and Chet Morgan!<br /><br />Liza Gusarova
B003G4W49C|5.0|Adults don't seem to get the way that we think, but this was easy to connect to, with interesting concepts and a compelling story.
B0000TLA9G|5.0|guns and roses has always been one of the best bands ever! this just compiles SOME of their great work!
B00902S0IS|3.0|The quality of the streaming via AmazonPrime is quite good.  The color still nicely frames this early version of James T. Kirk (Nielson) against a loosely stolen Prospero (Walter Pigeon's Morpheus) from Shakespeare ( a character he also likely stole). I've seen the hokey take-off musical in London and wanted to have a nostalgic review of a film version.  It's wryly humorous to watch early Nielson, Holliman, etc.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This was an amazing book, I loved it took me a moment to get into it in the beginning but after that it starts getting really good.. awesome ending..
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Another awesome addition. Would like to have read about Sam I miss him, but a great book and I can't wait for the next one.
B00000I07P|5.0|of course its great!! it always has been! bon jovi has stood the test of time! this will always be my favorite album, get jersy also!
B00B5HQLMI|4.0|Daniel Craig continues to play an emtotionally vulnerable Bond, even if he is jingoistic and aging.  Bond will continue to draw his romantic followers even if the bad guys and the good guys never kill the other guy immeditely when they have the chance.  It would spoil the thrill of the ensuing escape scenes.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|I've wanted to play this game for a while! Now I can! It's fun! All characters are great! I would like suggest this game to all!
B005GFPZYK|4.0|Reading about a sniper that has more kills than any other sniper in the world?  Verty detailed on some missions and  glimpse on how this affects a sniper.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I loved reading this book. Could not put it down for a second. All of her work is amazing, truly tugs at the heart strings.
B00B0LPWU6|3.0|Not Denzel best. You want to route for his character, but the character continues to lack redeeming qualities. The plane scenes were very well done! Very tense and exciting... Then movies drags.

B00B8M4IMK|5.0|With all the negative reviews one reads about any car charger, it is tempting to be stymied by indecision and not order anything.  I suspect people are more apt to write negative reviews then positive reviews.  An an Electrical Engineer, a car charger is not all that complicated but nevertheless with anything mass-produced there are invariably going to be some small number of manufacturing defects.  With that in mind, I took a chance on this charger and have been very satisfied with its charge rate and performance for my Iphone 5, no over-heating, no radio noise while it is charging, and seemingly no damage to the Iphone.  It chargers just as quickly as if it were plugged in at home. The design is sleek, compact, and appears to have the same build quality as, well, an Iphone.  Most impressively, it comes with an 18 month warranty.  Are you kidding me?  What other charger offers that?  I have received two e-mails from Anker thanking me for my purchase and letting me know they are there to backup their product should anything go wrong.<br /><br />They have their own website IAnker.com that allows you to ask questions and a phone number (another plus).  They also have an owner's manual, just a few pages.  This gives you the impression that at least they aren't some fly-by-night garage shop trying to make a quick buck.<br /><br />I'd give it 10 stars if I could.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|Horrible!  Had to delete it the app from my phone, it caused the screen to freeze.  Plus, the download took forever.
B00BEK6Z7M|5.0|One of the best laid out plans for a plot that I have come across in a long time. The characters are well defined and the story increases in its interest with each turned page.
B007CW2FIE|5.0|&#34;Ufffffff! I am going down from heaven&#34; This is the  pleasant feeling after listening the first CD of this magnificent set! It is a &#34;must have&#34;. Nothing better that this set to dream while you listen these excellent performances. Use high volume :-)<br />In Rock music the musical horror comes when, for example, you listen Jimmy Hendrix interpreted by a salsa group :-)<br />Here the Director and the orchestra are the right and good ones.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I would give it a 5 if I could cast PowerPoints with my iPhone or iPad. I can see amazing potential, but google is dragging its feet.
B005MYEQ9U|5.0|Netrebko is the first singer after Callas who can actually sing all the notes written in the score both low and high. She does not add fioritura in order to hide her inadequate low register (Gruberova Sills) and she is not afraid of her top notes plus she is in excelent vocal form - added to all that she is magnificent to look at from an acting point of view.<br />Truly the first descent Bolena after Callas'
B00008973A|5.0|Outstanding!!!  A fun show to watch with the kids, but there are a few R rated moments.  Very good!.<br />Thanks.
B00F35BV64|3.0|We were really looking forward to this movie, having greatly enjoyed the previous Star Trek movie with basically the same cast.  This was a disappointment as it was basically a lot of action and little engaging plot.  The actors were good in their parts, but the movie itself was not very engaging.  My husband and I have loved Star Trek through all of its incarnations, which made this a real downer given how good we hoped it would be.

B003O86FMW|5.0|The book was really good,time to read the next!<br />I think that the book was really good because of the authors usage of her words.
B00BP4X3W2|5.0|Great historiical movie. Great acting. Should be shown in High School history classes. We should never forget what some are capable of in this world.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|All about my kids.  They loved it at 8 and love at 30.  Speaks volumes to me.  Hadn't seen it in 15 years, saw it this Summer.  Laughed with my grand kids this time.
B0007939NO|5.0|It was almost odd to watch this classic...great fun, fantastic acting but not at all like contemporary movies.  No cussing, the love story had no raunchy sex, even the violent portion didn't portray any blood!  They just don't make good clean movies like this any more.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|This is a delightful story with all the right elements: varied and interesting characters, problems that need solving, and people whose lives are changed for the better as a result of what they learn from their experiences.  I loved the film before visiting India, but appreciated it even more afterwards.  It captures the country beautifully.
156224003X|5.0|This book has the key to releasing a lifetime of trying to liberate and free the musician within myself. I read it in one week and was able to start, what to me, was a new beginning and an immense relief over a lifetime of judging, criticizing and keeping my self from feeling free to really just let myself go and let the music come through me and not trying to control and mold it to the way I thought I should sound. I wish I had it to read over 30 years ago and not struggled all this time. I am looking forward to enjoying music more now as I perform it.
1742204120|3.0|I haven't actually traveled with this guide but was impressed by the way the author could give a clear sense of place when discussing different areas. I also liked the sidebars and boxes that would briefly give background on Indian history and culture. It seemed to be just enough to get a decent grasp of the material. That said, I was surprised that such a hefty book didn't have more photos or detailed maps.
B00B4804KS|5.0|With this movie being 20 yrs old, I can't believe how entertaining it still is!  In 7.1 channel surround, it feels like the T-Rex is in our living room.  I bought this for the 3D version, but even watching the 2D again is outstanding.  Great movie, great musical score!
0143038583|5.0|I want to grab everyone by the collar and say, &#34;READ THIS BOOK!&#34;  Pollan is a superb writer and with objectivity, without taking an &#34;ain't it awful&#34; tone, he reveals the problems our industrial agricultural complex.  The grassroots movement away from processed, mass produced, and in many cases actually harmful food approved by the FDA is gathering momentum thanks to books such as this.
0525478817|5.0|I could not put this book down.  I had to wait several months to get this book from my library as there was a rather long list of patrons who had placed their own names on the waiting list ahead of my own.  Had I known then that I would love this book so much, I would have saved myself the wait and simply bought the book in the first place.  This book is simply too good to simply read it once and set it aside while I move on in the search for another equally entertaining tale with which to occupy my time.  The Fault in Our Stars must have a place on my bookshelf of great books I never want to forget.
B005LAIHY0|1.0|Read A.J. Bullock's wonderful spearing of this totally dopey plot first.  Then, decide if you have a thirteen year old pimply-faced boy's mind, and if so, dive into this mis-mash of typical James Cameron-type nonsense.  Go on to ignore the incoherence and the destruction of the scientific method, enjoy the total improbabilities, and smile at the end like the village idiot because your rationality has been completely scrambled by this ridiculous movie.<br /><br />Like Cameron's and others' pseudo sci-fi babble, this movie is ONLY pictures and does nothing but tarnish Scott's film-making record.  Be sure to remember any reviewer who praises this movie and discount all later reviews by that paid-off &#34;writer.&#34;<br /><br />Its visual large scale is, of course, lost on your smaller screen at home, and all you are left with is something you wish you did not have and you hide from your friends in the dark hole along with AVATAR and the sinking boat movie.
B00DMKFN34|5.0|Great movie and sound, can't wait to see the 3D.  Any kid that loves CARS will love this as well!
B006LSZECO|5.0|I was not able to put this book down at all!!!! So many twists and turns i didn't know what to believe. I really liked Nick and felt horrible on how played he really was in the end. At the same time Amy just blew my mind away! If you want a book that keeps you on the edge of your seat this would be one of them!
B000PDYVVG|3.0|Elizabeth Gilbert is no doubt an excellent writer, but Eat, Pray, Love fails to keep a reader's interest. After the section devoted to Italy, Gilbert explains the practices and benefits of yoga and meditation in great detail turning the book  into a self-help manual rather than a memoir. For anyone unfamiliar with those practices, Gilbert's narrative might be enlightening. For others, her prose might sound heavy handed and self-serving. Personally, I wished she had devoted the whole book to Italy, where she's at her best describing the sights and food of the country.
B001BANK32|5.0|Always love Stephen King!! Read this once a long, long time ago and now that the new book has come out, I wanted to reread<br />this book before reading the next!
B00026WU82|5.0|silly to 'review' an album that rolling stone rated the 4th best ever put together - with the best rock and roll song ever done (like a rolling stone)<br />but this is going to take more than one setting to understand or appreciate, this aint pop music
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Wow!!! I have read this book 3 times and I still fall in love with Christian every time! Come on ladies...there is a part of you that would love to be in Ana's shoes at least just once if not more. The detail that was portrayed of their relationship made me feel like I mentally and physically was right there with them! I truly feel this book is a &#34;hall pass&#34; without actually doing the deed! There were moments I was so mad at Christian and the way he acted but let's face it...it is nice when the man takes control of situations and makes you feel like a goddess!!!
098555780X|5.0|If you beginnig knot tying, this book is for you.<br /><br />The colored pictures and the insructions explain very well how tying the knots.<br />(you can see only the pictures and understand how tying the knots).<br /><br /> This also give you the basics to tying knots.
B00FEJIVRQ|5.0|I think this is the best of the 3, as the story is great, but has more storyline than the other 2. OK the origin story is normally good, and required for non-comic book people, (although not knowing someone's origins, I think can actually add to the story, but not iron Man or Spidy), so 1 was good and got you involved.<br /><br />IM2 failed IMHO as the whole story was good guy/hero.robot versus bad guy/robot/hero and was just a CGI-fest with very little story.<br /><br />Whereas IM3 has as story, with some very good tricks and twists (no spoilers), although the SUIT seems to have bccome it's own star.Plus with Ben kingsley we have a superb villan
0061733199|5.0|Excelent addition to any emergency kit.  Lots of information and a wide range of topics from snakes to edible plants.
B004YM6JP0|5.0|Bought for my daughter for Christmas last year.  She wants season four with Blu-ray and regular DVDs.  Hope I can find that!
B004EAQNO4|5.0|Arrived as promised. I saw this film on HBO and was immediately captured by its presentation of &#34;if the Devil exists, God must also exist.
B00BKBCM4A|5.0|It's an interesting contradiction  , how natural and everyday-like Jessie Ware sounds on interviews and at the same time how extraordinaryly sensual and stylish on record and in her video clips .Great music deserves to be heard and this debut of hers has found it's audience , rightly so .<br /><br />\\"Wildest Moments \\" with it's eerie video clip with a camera swirling around an uber-stylish Ware had become a big radio hit last year but it's just one of the great moments in this tracklist .  \\" Who Says No To love \\" for example becomes more and more addictive everytime Ware sings the title question , for which the answer is obviously nowone . \\" Running \\" has a thrilling vocal climax and elegance worthy of the best Sade's tracks while the title track \\" Devotion \\" is a dark,  seductive , champagne flavored melody in which the singer demands more faith from her lover but the mood feels to be that preceding a break up .<br /><br />Ware has a powerful voice and a killer taste when it comes to texture and production . Even when she covers other people's songs , like on Bobby Caldwell's \\" What You Won't Do For Love \\" , it's minor details like the fine male backing vocals that really make the difference .<br /><br />I can go on forever on how sophisticated and beautiful this record sounds .Without doubt a must-have!
B007HLIUN4|4.0|Clever explantion about an important issue of our time: The difference status among countries. I read it whit pleasure and quickly
B0013F1D02|1.0|It just was not something that really grabbed me. For sure it was more of a kids movie and I realize that, but even with that considered it just didn't keep my eyes glued to the screen.
B007THA4FI|5.0|She can really cast her spell and she did it in this book.  I remember thinking it was well worth the read and recommended to others.
B003Y5H5C4|3.0|If you love Jesse Eisenberg than this movie is for you. This movie is okay, I'd watch it again with friends.
B00B5HQLMI|2.0|I found this movie rather dull. I only made it half way through before I turned it off. The plot line is predictable and I found Craig's acting pretty monotonous.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Amazing book and story that I'm very glad was shared with the civilian world. I spent my time in the USMC as a Texas boy and not to compare duties, training methods or missions but I can definitely connect with many points in this reading. A+ book and I can't wait to see the movie yet I know won't contain detail provided like the book did but interested to see how Hollywood screens this crazy, heart wrenching, bad a** mission.
B00338QENI|5.0|Excellent book.  I really enjoyed reading about this.  I am a cancer survivor and it was very interesting to learn about how the cells got distributed.  I felt very bad for the family that they did not get any money for the cells.
B0002IQNAG|5.0|I can watch this movie over and over again. The quality of this DVD is amazing and there are so many special features.
B00G32VYDG|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie. I had another opportunity to spend quality time with my son. Love to his his laughter. This movie is priceless for the memory it just created.
1451629184|5.0|IS A GREAT READ SHE WENT THREW ALOT THAT KIDS SHOULD NEVER GO THREW AND LIVED TO TELL HER STORY... I GOT THIS AT A GOOD PRICE AND WAS IN VERY GOOD CONDITION READ IT AND PASSED IT ON TO MY OTHER FRIENDS AND AT THE END GAVE IT TO THE LIBRARY....
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Its a really long book but its written in typical Ken Follett style. Its fascinating the way he weaves so many characters' lives. If you like historical fiction, you'll love this one.
B004GJYRA0|4.0|Great old classic movie. I have not seen this movie in years and I fell in love with this all over again.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I am so happy that my daughter recommended this book for me.  I loved every minute of it!  It has become my favorite book this year.
B0092S4WLY|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this game. My only complaint is that I completed all the floors and need the new ones to come soon....really soon. So please hurry and add new ones
B00BAXFCPO|5.0|So much important information in this book about &#34;brain&#34; food. Eat right to ward off Alzheimer.  I haven't read anything like it. Worth the investment.
B00CB4ET0K|5.0|really fun game to play! kindle is great way to receive games and so easy to down load to device!
B004DLPXAO|2.0|Not really impressed. There are a lot of issues with this app - even the one on my Windows phone. It really annoys me that it skps pages and/or paragraphs because the story line doesn't make sense! I've deleted and downloaded more than once still doesn't work right.
1439102732|3.0|I really couldn't get into this book. I don't think it was the subject matter so much as the writing. I really wanted to know more about Lucy. Picoult's books I find are very good except this one took me forever to get through. The last chapter was very nice though.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Easy to set up, works very well, picture quality excellent. We can control it with our smart phones as well as the laptop. The phones are more convenient controllers. Now we are waiting for it to cast Amazon content. Presently we use it just for Netflix. Often my wife is casting movies on the TV while I am watching something else from Netflix on my computer. Our second large screen TV does not have an HDMI port.
B00DNCUX8G|3.0|Didn't work for me. I bought it for my new iPhone 5s and hoped I'll be able to use my old Android car charger. It doesn't initiate charging though. When I use this product along with a regular iPhone wall adapter hooked to my microUSB cable, it's working fine...so the product itself is ok. It just doesn't work for my needs and I need to get a new car charger which I could have done right away and could have saved $15 for this adapter.
1476712042|5.0|perfect, very interesting book. I love it! Would purchase books like this in the near future definitely if the price were right.
B003VANOFY|5.0|I've owned this headset for about 3 years and just love them. I like being able to switch between surround sound and stereo, don't really use the provided G Keys though. The wheel volume control is great for fast volume control, I have a wheel volume control on my keyboard as well. I would say I get decent range with these, at least what I expected. Charge lasts a couple hours. Don't leave them anywhere someone might sit down :/. Super glue saved these babies though. They are really sturdy just as long as you're not rough with them. I would recommend these to anyone, the software could be tricky sometimes causing some games to crash, not really sure why but I would just close the logitech software and relaunch the game and then turn on the software while in game.
B003F48E4W|5.0|This is a cult classic, the Rocky Horror of the 80's.  Sutherland and Patric at their best, as much as I dislike Corey Haim he was a major contributor to this film.
B005JABSB6|1.0|Received a pair of these glasses that didn't work from the moment I took them out of the box!!<br />I was on vacation and therefore the time expired on returning the item so I called Sharp and they REFUSED to exchange the glasses for a working pair.... WHY? do you ask? Well because I mentioned to them that after I tried charging it with the TV I tried to charge it with a PS3 to see if it was my TV or the glasses that were messed up.... Whats there excuse? because I tried It on the ps3 I voided the warranty! F*** YOU SHARP! F*** YOUR PRODUCTS! STAY AWAY FROM S***TY SHARP! Now im screwed out of my money!<br />They just tried to find a way to blame me! IT DIDNT WORK FROM THE START! The damn plastic is still on the glasses! HAS NEVER BEEN USED!
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Loved it from top to bottom!! Wonderful find in a free book. Would recommend it to any sci-fi fan. Could not put it down.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I pllay this game every day It;s just that great. I have been trying to store it on my kindle but having problems doing it. It will not let me use my email and pass word.
B00AZMFK3K|4.0|I enjoyed the movie very much. Sure its got some differences from the original series, but I'm ok with that.
B00127RAJY|4.0|I got it within the delivery window.  Usually when I order from Amazon, I get it immediately, but I got it on the last day of the window.  Which is fine, but next time I'll just go to Target for an instant satisfaction.  I'm on Level 2, Day 9.  She's kicking my butt! I can feel and notice a difference in my stomach, sides, and hips.
B00E8S2KV2|5.0|Think what you like about the adaptation (it seems that all of the 1-star reviews are complaining that it isn't &#34;true to the book&#34;), but let's face it - the reason you buy the 5-disc rather than the 2-disc is for the bonus features.  And what a load there is.  Over nine hours of the best content I've ever seen; it's even better that the extended LoTR features.  My only disappointment was finding that there is only one commentary track rather than the four for LOTR.
B00DOPEGAS|4.0|My daughter has been playing with this since we've given it to her.  I was a little disappointed in the price, which was higher than any store local to us, but all the stores local to us were completely sold out.  Still well worth the money.
B0093OGBL6|5.0|Love it, finally a good book about the King of Pop. If you are a MJ fan then this is the perfect book for you, a must read.
B006ISJQ26|4.0|Colin Farrell is one of my favorite actors.  I like almost all of his movies simply because he is in them
B008D28HYS|5.0|I use this program on my kindle fire. I love it!  It is a Great entertainment puzzle.  Challenging upper levels.
B005HP2JAM|5.0|I saw this movie in 3D Imax when it came out and I was blown away by the privilege of being able to see this. This cave was obviously a holy place for our distant ancestors and I felt the holiness of it while watching. The images reminded me of the mystery and awesomeness of our planet and our place on our planet. Nothing in this movie is scrubbed by styrofoam or fast food. This is a movie about the place where humans interjected imagination and thus raw consciousness into life's mysteries. Very few people will ever see this and the 3D viewing makes it seem like you are there. I have been at archeological sites where the the dreams of our ancestors seems to hang like fine fruit in the silence. For me there was nothing to do, but sit and wait in it. That's how I felt while watching this movie. However, I think this movie would be nothing more than the usual Nat-Geo fare if watched in 2-D. The 3-D makes all of the difference in the world. I felt that I was there.<br /><br />My son has a 3-D 72&#34; tv and I'm buying this for him for Christmas, with a selfish motivation that I will once again see it in 3D
B00AJLHUWQ|4.0|Very good album.  One of my favorites of 2013.<br /><br />Musically the band has drifted more toward Lunatic Soul and away from their heavier LP ADHD.  Other reviewers have called it more melodic, cheerful, and giving a 70s vibe which I can all agree too.<br /><br />In my opinion not as good as Second Life Syndrome or ADHD, but hey, that is my opinion.  Check it out for yourself!
B004LROUW2|2.0|The book was very interesting at the beginning then, as if the author didn't know what to do next.  So he started sharing his own views through the characters of the book.  This wouldn't have been annoying if he did it in less than 400 pages out of the 925 in the book.  The plot was different and differentiated but the author didn't know how to exploit it better.  Could have kept the book to less than 500 pages and it would have probably been better.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I really enjoy this game. Have been around the map many times in it and still go back to it.
B001BANK32|5.0|Breathless doesn't begin to describe the climax of this novel.  Each time I read it, the quick pace and the brutally blunt writing throughout the action scenes leave me rushing through and wishing I had savored it, but not sure if that's ever going to be possible.  And of course there's the delicious build-up that starts on page one and doesn't ease up until people are bleeding and things are burning.  Always a winner, and in this edition I loved the glimpses of the sequel, Dr. Sleep.  Can't wait to get my hands on a copy of that one!
B00BZOD63S|3.0|Another great horror movie, not the best, has it's twists, only real complaint is it's one of those loud/ quite movies, way too quite during regular conversations so you turn the volume up then the loud parts are way to loud in attempt to scare you more, doesn't scare me more, just annoying I have to constantly adjust volume, however this is not the only movie that does this, someone spread the word to stop doing this with movies, anyway pans labyrinth is better.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|amazing this works exactly as advetised and has the simplest setup you have a phone download chromecast appt plug it in and your ready to go have a computer download google chrome and chromecast extension and your done literally takes no more then 2 minutes now it terms of streaming there is good and bad news good news is it works as advertized stream hulu netflix google play now youtube and more  once your streaming you can do other things on your phone or computer whithout interupting the stream got a call take it and let eveyrone else keep watching or pause from your phone fast forward rewind you name it also there is an extension on your chrome tab (computer only) that allows you to stream the entire screen to the tv now this is still in beta form but I love it because I dont have cable (im cheap) and this allows me to go to project free tv and watch the walking dead or game of thrones from the computer stream it to the tv and click full screen and now youve got quality free tv (if your in full screen mode you cant use the computer to do seperate task in that mode) if you want to view a pic or personal video save just drop the pic into a chrome tab (computer only) and boom its on the tv now the bad side the wifi dongo is extremely bad my home is roughly 1200 square feet the router and chromecast seprated by about 18 (centurylink router) feet got a terrible signal and sometimes dropped the streaming task it had also the apps are limited but in enough time more developers will be on board and you can stream more but now its only the few I mentioned before so all in all if you router is close enough and there are too many wall or you have a really good router this buy is the only thing that makes sense nothing compares<br /><br />side note: if your going to stream something in hd from the play store do it on your phone play store on a computer (you can view your purchase when you log into your google) won't work stream in hd just 480p or under
B00CNQ7CRI|5.0|I laughed out loud ..... many times.... it was so typical Bridget!!!.. I Loved it... read it in about 3 days
B005GK6QAM|5.0|Sunstorm another great album for Joe Lynn Turner what a voice!  Every song has hooks galore love this album and can't get enough it's like 1983 never ended!!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Love it but my 3 year old granddaughter plays as good as me we even count the coins and call ourselves RICH
B00FATEJYE|5.0|The game is So so so so so good. Just too slow to upgrade. Don't have money to buy the  credit.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Tense and suspenseful.<br />For me the epilogue brought it all together, and served as a firm reminder that perception is NOT reality.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|Good movie, my son loved it! Keeps you guessing ;) The story is fast moving and you will never guess the end!
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|The game is amazing and the graphics are incredible for a mobile game! I am stunned at the hunting mechanics, so beautifully designed. I have been addicted since the start!
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|Brilliant. Fun. Suspenseful. Well-written. Javier was good and evil! Craig was hot, as usual. Dench was incredible. I love 007!
B00B0LPWU6|4.0|This movie was really good. I loved Denzel and as usual he did an outstanding job. It was nothing like I expected it to be and that was good.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Incredible account of bravery and brotherhood.  This should be required reading in schools.  I wanted to read it before the film, just to get a better sense of what happened, but I wish I would have read it even sooner.  Well-paced, informative and gripping.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|I upgraded from an i5 2320, only because I wanted maximum performance to run 3x 7950s in crossfire eventually, right now I'm using a single 7950 3gb XFX DD edition, on Battlefield 3 at ultra I was getting around 30 fps minimum, 70 fps maximum, and about 45 fps average, I upgraded to this cpu, and combined it with the MSI Z77A-G45 GAMING motherboard, Overclocked the cpu to 4.2ghz (was an absolute piece of cake! which was within the first 5 minutes of completing the mobo and cpu upgrade) I'm using a Cooler Master Hyper Evo 212 cpu cooler and the maximum temps in bf3 were only 52c (still way more overclocking headroom) and the fps boost was phenomenal compared to my i5 2320, the minimum fps didn't even dip below 60+ frames per second! about 150fps maximum, and around 60-80fps average, I am totally psyched for this amazing cpu :)
B008YCMM2A|5.0|Incredible. The whole may not be greater than the sum of the parts here, but the individual parts (the five musicians) are playing on such an amazingly high level that it takes the breath away. Possibly Miles' greatest quintet, albeit his least documented, which is saying a ton.
0736092269|5.0|Really enjoyed reading through this book. Even with a biology degree and having taken anatomy I still learned a lot from it. Definitely found some great workouts to add to my routine
B00G32QIEG|1.0|I love Jeff but in this movie I could not understand a darn thing he said.  It was distracting.  This movie was like Men in black with a twist.  I will NOT be watching this film again anytime soon.
B002M9WW30|5.0|It's Awesome!!! I finally get to see all of the Rocky movies that are in one set. And it's in Blu-Ray!!!
B008IJT0CE|4.0|I set this to 2 hours every night, it's relaxing and since I have tinnitus, it helps to not concentrate on that sound.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|this game is fun.  my kids love it.  I even like to play!!  give it a try, it's free so why not?
0345803507|2.0|The first of the series was enough.  This is repetitious. The editors are capitalizing on the first one's success. Two pages ionto ijt , I quit.
B00B7FOQCK|3.0|This is my second one.  This one works great.  The other actually ate one stopped working.  The one that works has no problem using high performance discs as well as my mouse and keyboard.
B00DQBWLSO|1.0|Ok, I've never been a big Mayer fan.  His vocal range is very limited, and it shows on this album. That, and the written music is pretty simplistic.  I just think any of CSNY have him beat any day. I found 3 songs of some merit on this album.
B00FLDG5AA|3.0|Having been an Eric Clapton fan going back to the days of Cream, (1967) I have enjoyed seeing and hearing Clapton's style and music. However, I have to say I was disappointed with this double cd. For instance I have also been a Taj Mahal fan since &#34;Take a Giant Step&#34; came out...and have seen Keb Mo' a few times; (Keb being similar to Taj's ealy years; The one cut they did a duet on was, SAD... This album was more on the Jazz side of the house rather than Blues.<br />It will go in my library but wont get much play.
B002QE3CTY|4.0|This isn't typically a book I find myself reading. However, I had a hard time putting this book down. I found myself on this journey with Thomas and my heart was racing right along with him. The only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is because I felt like the other could have been a little deeper but either way I still liked it a lot.
B000BJS4OY|5.0|Nothing better than being able to watch Bruce Springsteen, early in his career.  It has capture the raw energy that he is all about.
B00GPE9HEA|3.0|It's too much EDM for a Britney Spears album. There is really nothing personal about it, it is an attempt to show a softer side (at times) and frankly, I don't care for it. Britney Spears is pop, not EDM, and it shows, especially when half of the songs of the album is pure synths and heavy bass. I thought that Femme Fatale was getting to a point where there was too much EDM, but there is absolutely no comparison. I do like some of the tracks and the EDM is fine at times. I do like \\"Tick Tick Boom\\", I like the heaviness of the beat and I can rock to it. But this feels like a lack of effort by the Britney Spears team, it feels forced and was just thrown together (which seems to be a trend about Britney Spears these days.) I really wanted Britney to come out with a POP album, and I don't even care about her having fixed vocals for the most part as long as it isn't extremely visible.<br /><br />This is certainly not her best work, and that is because will.i.am EP'd the album. Will.i.am is not that good, and he defecated all over this album with his simple synth rhythms that were not needed nor wanted. Blackout-Femme Fatale were club bangers because they weren't just emphasized synths that will.i.am spent 5 minutes on the computer. It would also be nicer if Britney actually promoted her album and PERFORMED some of her songs to get people interested, there has not been a single performance of Work B*tch and her interviews are boring and repetitive, it certainly doesn't get me interested in this album.<br /><br />Nonetheless, I do like some of the tracks on this album. Alien is interesting, not gonna lie, and alot of the EDM tracks are worth a listen, but it gets repetitive...quickly. Perfume was good for a day, Til It's Gone & Body Ache are ok, Chillin' With You is not a Britney Spears track (plain and simple), It Should Be Easy is atrocious (ft. will.i.am of course) it almost sounds like will.i.am ft. Britney. I do not feel connected to a single track on this album to the level I did with the last 3 albums and that is disappointing, but that didn't stop me from listening and jamming to this album.<br /><br />I would honestly recommend giving it a listen and judge for yourself. I personally feel like this is a weak attempt with a lack of effort and really crappy producers (ergo will.i.am). But that doesn't mean that there are some decent tracks that I would like to hear in a club or blast in my car.
1451666179|5.0|Absolute hilarity. If you've read the blog, you'll know what I'm talking about. Seriously amazing read. I highly recommend this book for whatever mood you're in at the time.
B007THA4FI|5.0|This is not Harry Potter - in fact I'm not a huge HP fan.  I love this book though. Rowling is fierce, honest, and insightful.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book inspires me to keep searching and saving those in need and those who I hold close  to my heart even when u know there is nothing you can do. This book is inspiring  and I encourage every one to read it
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|It was amazing. I cried at least 5 times. Its heartbreaking yet inspiring to people of all ages. Please read this book.
B00DNB9RXO|5.0|It's been awhile since I've run across a game with no ad aware modules left in.<br />This game is fun and challenging which is what gaming is all about!<br />It has cool black &amp; white graphics, good sound track and decent controls.<br />For $1.00 it's a great value and I would gladly paid it had it not been FAOTD here on Amazon.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|If you like musicals, this is for you.  Wicked is one of the greatest musicals of the modern era.  Singing and dancing.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Works perfect with the phone app and the tv,  does every thing they said it would.  Worth the price for sure
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love playing this game. I never know how far I'm going to go or what I may run into. It's an awesome game and my kids love it too. They are always asking to play to see how far they can get and beat each other's top scores.
B007XGJK4G|5.0|Great biography of Bob Marley. I learned alot of information that I clearly had no clue of. Bob Marley was one of the greats.
B00C5R8364|5.0|Just my kind of read....grabs you from the start and doesn't let go.  Just want to sit and read when I should be Christmas Shopping!  Definitely put this on your list!!
B0013V3GN8|5.0|Excellent behind the scenes coverage, and great concert footage! I highly recommend it for any Elvis fan! It's a great deal!
B00A6CCF0K|2.0|I've always wanted to know what happened to Danny after he escaped  the overlook. Now I know.Danny and Abra make a great team. GREAT BOOK, FAST READ. CLASSIC KING. 4 stars
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|VIVA Stephen King! &#34;Doctor Sleep&#34; humanized the process of &#34;passing on&#34; by giving us Dan at his best. It's a perfect ending to the 1977 classic, &#34;Shining&#34;
B00CNQ7HAU|3.0|Easy Read in the beginning then picks up to being a page turner. The ending however was not what I expected. Very disappointing.
B004GYY714|4.0|Excellent selection of stations.  Sometimes it is a little tempermental to call up.  But all in all worth the little extra trouble.
B004XZR63M|5.0|Well writing and filled with knowledge helps you learn from mistakes you are making.  I would recommend this book to anyone.
B001GKJ2DY|4.0|On subsequent viewings, although the plot is fine and nicely unfurls, I still cringe at some of the dialogue that (now) 3-time Oscar winner Meryl Streep, Emmy winner Christine Baranski (TV's &#34;Cybill&#34;), and Oscar nominee Julie Walters (&#34;Billy Elliot&#34;) are forced to recite in &#34;Mamma Mia&#34; (more specifically, in about the first 30 minutes), especially after seeing Streep in the, of course, superior &#34;Kramer vs. Kramer,&#34; a Best Picture winner, which is why I took one star away (I also can't help but wonder what this movie would've been like with, for example, John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John as the leads; dare to dream!).  Fortunately, however, there's enough of ABBA's irresistible and enduring music to pick up most of the pieces and to lift the entire cast to feel-good heights, making the cast themselves look like they are having a great time in basically a lavish ABBA karaoke-style party of a movie.  And it also helps that there's no weak link in the ABBA musical catalog, with my personal highlights being the lesser known gem &#34;Our Last Summer&#34; and, of course, Streep's undeniably solid and emotionally driven &#34;The Winner Takes It All,&#34; right from the side of a mountain!  The rest of the very likable and energetic cast includes Pierce Brosnan, who was unnecessarily chastised by critics for his actually very respectable singing (let's see a critic belt out &#34;S.O.S.&#34; as good as Brosnan did!), as well as Colin Firth, Stellan Skarsgard, the angelic Amanda Seyfried, and Dominic Cooper.  Another strength is its cinematic message that the older women and men in the leads can carry a movie just fine, thank you (as opposed to seemingly youth-targeted Hollywood).  No one can match the magic of the original ABBA music and singing, but this is probably the closest you can get without a genuine ABBA reunion.  Although it undoubtedly will be labeled a chick flick by most, if you like a feel-good movie with a happy ending, one that makes you want to watch it again and again, this one's made especially for you!  [Nerd fact #1: Executive producers for this film, those who invested their own money in helping it get made, include actor Tom Hanks and his wife/actress Rita Wilson; nerd fact #2:  the two original male members of ABBA make cameo appearances in the film, Benny Andersson during &#34;Dancing Queen&#34; and Bjorn Ulvaeus in the final scene that ends the credits; nerd fact #3:  Streep also sang in the drama &#34;Postcards from the Edge&#34; (1990); Brosnan also sang in &#34;Evelyn&#34; (2002)]s made especially for you.

B0037VNX44|4.0|Great movie, kind of in the style of &#34;Natural Born Killers,&#34; definitely enjoyed it.  I do like prison movies though such as HBO's &#34;OZ&#34; series, etc.  I will have to watch this one again!
1607053888|5.0|A great book for anyone who sews. Easy to understand and fashion foreword, This is a great how to book
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book kept me on the edge of my seat and I never lost interest in the book. The best part was when Annebeth was on her own to follow the mark of Athena.

B003ZSJ212|5.0|Blu-ray really brings out everything in a huge amount of detail.  Yes, I wish it was the original releases, but I knew they weren't when I purchased them so it doesn't take away from what you get.  Well worth it for the Star Wars fan... the picture quality will amaze you.
B001OQCV6A|5.0|A great DVD Robert Downey Jr. is fantastic as the super sleuth and Jude Law is great as Watson. A must for any DVD collection
B00A77II0U|5.0|I loved this game and the how creepy it is I could not quit playing until I beat it strongly suggest it!
B0040UAYI4|5.0|Its easy to use and works well on FPS games and you have great advantage over others who use controllers.
B00DNB9RXO|5.0|my nephew pointed this out to me and asked if he could play so I downloaded and then ended up playing it myself its a really cool game especially when its the free app of the day
B002HK9IDQ|5.0|A must have for anyone who loves old movies . No one is as lovely as Audrey Hepburn and Rex Harrison is great. this package came without any problems, every thing was as expected.
B00EMGUR60|1.0|The Reason Is Simple,. Mickey Dee Just Isn't The Right Drummer For Motorhead.There I Said It. Never Has Been,Never Will Be. Don't Get Me Wrong He's A Great Drummer. Love The Stuff He Did With King D. But Lemmy Has Always Maintained That Moterhead Is A Rock And Roll Band..Not A Metal Band. So With Mickey In The Pocket.They Sound Like Every Other Metal Band. Because Mickey Pretty Much Sounds And Same On Every Song Recorded With The Band. The Heart And Soul Is Long Gone. The Band Sounds Very Boring And Predicable With Mickey.This Might Be A Good Record For A Band With Another Name. But Not For a True Motorhead Fan Such As Myself. In Large There Hasn't Really Been A Great Motorhead Record Since Orgasmatron.
B00F7YHDWC|1.0|This is one of those things that is difficult for parents:cutesy artwork and mature theme. My 7 yr old downloaded this. Yeah.. No problem deleting it but I wish Amazon would make things that will be questionable to parents, at the very least birthday protected to match the owners account information. If I buy an &#34;M&#34; rated video game, I have to verify I am over 18. I definitely recommend Amazon do this themselves. A cousin's 9 yr old daughter did the same thing and 2 yr old brother thought this was so cool! It is &#34;not cool&#34; with Mom and Dad.
B00B0LPYXG|5.0|This is one of my favorite drama movies of all time. The action is nail-biting (first 35 minutes of the movie are pure white-knuckle, grip your chair), the acting is fantastic (this is expected of Denzel) and the characters are deep - deeply complex and flawed. This is an all around fantastic drama. Highly recommend it. It was just as good if not better the 2nd time (even though you know the turns the story takes).
B00005JO20|4.0|Nothing will ever match the wonder I experienced watching the original but this is a very good movie. Great effects, huge action and a strong take on the Beauty and the Beast story. Naomi Watts is lovely and Kong seems alive. I would opt of the Blu-Ray if you have a player, otherwise this DVD is very good.
B00632HWOG|3.0|Thought the App was good till Yahoo &quot;upgraded&quot; the version now I hate using it.  I've gone back to viewing it through the web.
B00EP2PXCY|5.0|This is an album that absolutely every song is on reply!! Seriously there is not one song I don't like, and that goes a long way. :D
B00C7EGV5U|4.0|Makes a change to have unbiased writing about the subject. Would have liked an explanation about some of the happenings, but a really good read.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|easy enough but can be challenging!  I enjoy playing, and so does my 6 year old son.  It's a good problem-solving game for him, and it keeps me entertained.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|I THINK THIS is the most challenging bubbles game yet...is a little hard to sir and shoot st first but don't long to get the hang of it
B0072GPQNG|5.0|I first saw the movie in the theatre. Then I saw the making of the Broadway play on PBS. Then I just saw the traveling play in Syracuse on November 30th. I loved every minute of all three. I am an animal lover - to the extent that I prefer animals to people. I had an abusive adoptive mother and suffer from acute PTSD as a result. The movie and play made me cry throughout. BUT THAT IS WHAT THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO DO - EVOKE EMOTION TO GET PEOPLE TO TAKE ACTION. I have not read the book yet, but am buying that as well as the movie, because I have heard (and also spoke to someone at the play who said I must read the book) that it is written AS SEEN THRU THE EYES OF THE HORSE. This movie IS for animal lovers. We as a society MUST protect the Earth and all living creatures on it. We are the guardians of Earth and all living creatures, big and small. This movie, the play, and book are meant to evoke so much emotion in those who love animas to get them to STAND UP FOR THEM AGAINST THE HORRENDOUS ABUSE THAT ANIMALS SUFFER AT THE HANDS OF HUMANS. Animal lovers, please watch this movie. Cry your eyes out, and then do something about the abuse of animals that occurs every day.

B009UX2YAC|4.0|My 6 and 8 year old boys like the Temple Run type of games.  This one has a completely different &#34;setting&#34; but essentially is the same concept.
B00FMAZ49U|5.0|Creativity and superior quality product is what Spigen use to separate them self from the rest.Just simple perfection.First I'd thought that the Proximity Sensors and Front facing camera would have been affected by them not having a cutout .Well I had to swallow my pride and say that Innovative thinking deserves these five stars .One cut out is good enough (speaker)and the ultra crystal is a premium choice as a nexus 5 screen protector.It fits perfect to the screen so as not to cause any lifting once used with Spigen cases.I'm a perfectionist so I know ....
B005P1YCNK|5.0|Working through the book has already altered my life and improved my business. We need to make a shift in our thinking if we want to make a change in our life and business.
B00E9O6C96|5.0|Amazing sound quality.  I just got to hear a song that I listend to years ago through X3 (via cheap but great ATH-050 headphones oh...  and the music file format was in FLAC) and man...  it sounded like a completely different song.....  Mind blown.  UI is pretty bad though (as others already pointed out) but it could be worse.  Screen protector it comes with is pretty bad as well...  but who cares?  Noone is buying this machine for the looks, UI, or accessories it comes with.
B0014JIFWG|5.0|We got these for my fiance to wear to work. He works in a kitchen and he loves wearing them. They keep his feet dry and they're comfortable.
B002SRQ214|5.0|I was blown away at the performance of this chip. It is outstanding. Its price competitive with an i3, but it whips it in every way. I currently use it for gaming and have yet to meet a game that has put any real strain on the chip. Civ 5, SupCom, Crisis 3, Fallout 3, nothing has come close to using the capacity of the chip.<br />The only problem is the heatsink. If it runs fast it is loud. So loud you can't really get much done. But it is an easy fix, just go to BIOS and set the fan settings for the cpu in such a way that it doesn't run crazy. Easy.<br />Otherwise this is a definite buy.
B004SBQGHS|2.0|This is the original angry birds with quite a few updates... Not all for the best.  The most annoying is that I have ads in the &amp;#34;add free version.&amp;#34;  I don't know how that makes any sense.  The latest update adds a cool powerup to the bomb bird, but is awkwardly close to the pause button allowing for easy accidental uses.  It's not even in the same group as other powerups Thanks Rovio?
B007SYWFRM|3.0|needs more games like scrats fish swipe, it would be more fun with other games and if you could play/chalange your friends in games, making it more interactive
B00EW9GQR6|4.0|Explicit and not made for a younger group . The songs are sexually explicit and should be listened to by the older generations.
B0084AXZK0|5.0|Basil, who up until now was a mediocre painter after meeting Dorian Gray a young Adonis, was inspired to create a masterpiece of which he puts himself into. Against Basil's wishes, Dorian Gray is influenced by Basil's friend Lord Henry. Dorian looks at his portrait and realizes that while the portrait will stay young forever, he will grow old; so Dorian makes a wish that if only he could stay young forever and the portrait can age.<br /><br />At first Dorian does not realize his wishes been granted. He falls in love with a beautiful young actress who is every woman that Shakespeare ever wrote about. But once again due to Lord Henry's influence, he realizes that she's just a common girl.<br /><br />Starting with absent-minded acts Dorian slowly sinks into debauchery. And with every new act his picture becomes more grotesque while Dorian stays is young and as innocent looking as the day his picture was painted.<br />What will become of Dorian?<br />What will become of Dorian's painting?<br />What would you do if you were Dorian?<br /><br />Oscar Wilde paints a picture himself as he describes Dorian Gray's dilemma. And we as readers travel with Dorian as each decision is made. In some places in the story Oscar Wilde seems to drag on and on with detail; however we find that this detail is necessary to set the next scene.<br /><br />Oscar Wilde himself led a risky life that lead to a jail sentence; is attitudes can be seen in the dialogues in this book.
B00F4IS9YW|5.0|I got this as a present for my mom who is in love with the movie and having all the extras really made even better for her gift.
B007704HO6|5.0|My heart melts after reading this book, I would recommend this to any one who have a heart. Epically those who also have a ginger cat in their life.
B00A2H9P98|5.0|I watched this movie two times. It has lots of action and twists that are unexpected. Very enjoyable. The characters are great
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|I found this book to be remarkably refreshing in shedding a new light of one of the most controversial men in history, and about whom most people know very little about. One of the details that pleased me was putting the region of Palestine of those times under the microscope, as it were. An example being the iron-fisted rule of Rome and how intolerant they were of sedition, the crime Jesus the Nazarene was crucified for. A must-read book, I feel, for anyone interested in knowing more about the historical Jesus the Christ.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|Absolutely bulletproof!  It's built like a brick.  Incredibly thick blade with full tang.  Excellent camp knife.  You can count on this sucker to matter what the task.
B00H1O47D4|4.0|The Governor was not a villain. He was an &#34;anti-villain&#34;. A natural leader that would do whatever it takes to protect the ones he loves. I can sympathize with him. In truth, I'm not sure how much different I would've been from the man if I had lived his life. Truly a multi-layered character that was killed off far too soon, there were so many more stories that could've been told. His death is the reason I didn't give it a five.<br /><br />They should get Rick and Michonne to hook up. Carl would like that.
1449305172|5.0|Ash's book, Running Lean, gives startup entrepreneurs and tech leaders startlingly practical advice. You won't find hype here. Instead, you'll get practical guidance from an engineer with an entrepreneur's mindset.<br /><br />I've met Ash when he's been in Kendall Square, Cambridge. He's a personable, realistic guy who wants to see innovators succeed in any industry.<br /><br />Read the book, take his advice to heart, and put what you learn to work. You will not be disappointed. You will be a better entrepreneur.
B002C6K7N0|5.0|I've never been into Megadeth. I like their style, but never connected with their music. With Metallica sucking it handsomely as they do these days, I guess I decided to give this disc a spin looking for something along the lines of that Metallica/Megadeth sound. I was actually impressed with this. I gave it a spin, not expecting much. Gave it another spin. A few months later I'm still playing it. This, to me, is better than stuff that came out when I was a teenager which many consider their 'classics.' Just my opinion.
B004H83IG4|5.0|Great price & fast delivery! Good movie! Ordered another movie that came with this! I'm happy! Wish I could say the same for the other movie I ordered, not the same shop though.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Good unit and function very well.  Only complain is not enough applications supporting it except YouTube yet.  I wish it can support Miracast as well but not sure the protocals can co-exist.
B0053B347M|1.0|Pros: none<br /><br />Cons: weak adhesive, dim lighting, limited applications<br /><br />The adhesive is weak and doesn't stick to monitors that well. I like how it is USB powered, but the lights are pretty dim and wouldn't work well as bias lighting. I would look for other options; this one isn't worth it.
B004J4XGN6|5.0|Ries offers legitimately new ideas on how to approach product development as a new venture.  By breaking down the implied assumptions in the product hypothesis and testing them one by one, you systematically replace uncertainty with customer validated knowledge.  This approach would have saved me a lot of money when starting my company!
B0063IH60K|4.0|A solid solitaire game. I like the cumulative scoring. it has frozen up a few times,  but just reload it and it swings back.
B000XUBFE2|2.0|I was exited to read this book because I knew it was coming out as a movie and wanted to read it before. It took me awhile to read (I usually read books pretty fast) and I felt there was no suspense and the ending was boring. There were sad parts, don't get me wrong, but I would not recommend it to someone I know.
B007KGXY0K|5.0|The board worked fine for me, and was one of the first motherboard installations that worked perfectly on first boot.<br /><br />I used:<br />2x Intel E5-2690<br />8x 8GB Samsung EEC DDR3 RAM<br />1x EVGA GTX 590<br />2x LSI 9205-8e SAS HBA<br />1x Intel X520-T2 10GbE Network Card

B008602KQI|5.0|I enjoyed the book and the movie and I wanted a review before I saw the second movie. Really enjoyed watching it on my computer!

1476727651|5.0|A haunting read in itself but also as a companion to The Shinning.  Danny's unsettling life continues in this thriller only King can conjure.
B008JFUR10|5.0|This movie is amazing! I'm a fan of mecha, so of course I'm in. Still, I was surprised at how much I loved the story line and the characters. The story line is captivating, the movie looks great, and the music is fantastic (really capturing that large and epic quality of the movie itself). Furthermore, if you watch the Director's Cut you'll get an entirely new perspective on the movie thanks to Guillermo Del Toro.
B005N7CA3A|4.0|Darren Hayes is hit or miss with me. I generally love his albums but he tends to have more tracks that I'm blah about then love. But the ones I like, I love. There's no middle ground for me with his music. I either love it or it's blah. This album is more hmmm interesting to me. The stand outs make it worth the damn exxpensive price.<br /><br />Black out the sun<br />Roses<br />Bloodstained Heart<br />Taken by the Sea<br />Nearly Love<br /><br />Black out the sun is the stand out track for me. Damn, I feel like, if I have a broken heart, he just wrote and expressed how'd I feel. This song was on repeat for 48 hours straight (literally), Went to sleep with it, drove with it, workedout to it, etc etc. Darren is seriously underrated. If you can find this album, pick it up, it's worth it.<br /><br />EDIT: Fav new song: The Siren's Call. alos check out him singing live on youube. He's kept his voice all these years and his shows look great. I wish he'd our American again.<br /><br />Also: I truly love his voice and about 90% of his music. It definately touchs my heart.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|This is always the favorite of our family and my daughter absolutely loves it.  I bought this for the Blu-ray version as a gift for her, and she enjoyed this version very much.  We just watched the same play on TV last night with Carrie Underwood as Maria.  It was just not the same.
1475143389|5.0|I just got this book about two weeks ago and I'm already going through it for the forth time! Every time I've gained a little tidbit more about how to tweak something to conform to what my body needs! This book has been one of the smartest purchases I have made all year. It's super informative and all the information is backed by science. I love the logical steps that are outlined to both working out and dieting. This book has changed the way I workout, and the most amazing part of all is the fact that the author, Mike Matthews, is willing to help with any questions. He even leaves his contact information at the end of the book!
B00A992W9Y|5.0|I enjoy Ke$ha's music for what it is - mindless, catchy, popping music. I think this album holds up to her others in quality and creativity. She's fun and wild and this album reflects that.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|There are many games that I like,but this game, I love and I also like that they added the bapples to earn more rewards.
1449410243|5.0|Cute, funny, and frighteningly accurate. Some material may not be appropriate for children depending on how overprotective you are. Great gift for a cat lover.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|This was a very enjoyable, light read.  I looked forward to reading every night and discovering where it was going.  I liked how all the characters were somehow entwined.  I would've rated it higher, but I felt she could've done a little better with the ending.  Overall, a great read!
B007MB5OCE|4.0|Interesting concept of a totally apolitical man.  Does such an individual really exist?  Once I got beyond the original concept, the rest fell into place rather nicely.
B00DYFCZ2Y|5.0|This is the true John Legend here and I loved every minute of this cd!  This disc was so mellow and laid back, that it would be hard not to get into what he's singing about.  He clearly has the gift of song and is able to convey his emotions thru it.  This is what R&B is all about.  Giving soft, yet sexy, all at the same time, this dude is truly gifted in his craft.  WAY TO GO, JOHN!!!!
B009AMANBA|4.0|Educational, yet would like the movie to be longer and more detailed. Abraham Lincoln had so much going on in his life, I feel like some of the best moments were left out, yet maybe there will be another movie made about him that will be even more detailed.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|For $35 you can't go wrong with this.  I have a 50&#34; Plasma TV that is about 6 years old and is not a smart TV, until now.  I really hope that Google allows for more open development on this so we can get some more apps.
193700788X|2.0|I could not bring myself to say I absolutely hated this book but if I am being honest, this is a 1.5 star at best.
B000KUD2G4|5.0|This thing is AMAZING!!!!!! I've been battling with the computer noise issue for years and I finally tried to do something about it with this box. As soon as I hooked it up that annoying hum static noise was gone from my studio monitors. The trick with this box is you have to make sure you find the source of the problem. Meaning if you put it on the equipment thats not causing the problem it wont work. I LOVE IT!!!!!!
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Good Movie! Love this series. I found this movie easier to follow than Lord of the Rings yet with the same great cast.
B00EPO1308|4.0|i am writing this in the regard to the Steve Wilson Vinyl remix of Benefit  if yer a big fan of this album you may be slightly disappointed ..it is my favorite and I also have the original vinyl and I compared the differences.. on \\"Nothing to say\\" (new mix) there is no double tracked lead vocal till the last verse ..and the mix sounds cleaner  but I prefer the original mix ..maybe cause it's the mix I grew up listening to  the vocal is more prominent in the mix its just not double tracked till the last verse and the double tracking gives it that psychedelic edge which I'm sure Ian hated ..the one that is really noticeable is \\"A time for everything\\" there is no doubling vocal on the new mix and Martins guitar could of came up some ..you could hear it yes but its like Mr. Wilson put more compression on it.. as a matter of fact I think this release is overly compressed maybe it sounds cleaner ..but sometimes imperfections could be a good thing... also it seems to be equalized flatter the cd older version I have is more high endy (maybe that's the case with all CD'S)but I had to turn my treble setting down to 2... on the new vinyl version I turned it up to 8 and 10 which is the highest setting I think its a drag when producers do new mixes of something old... that they squeeze the life out of it by putting tons of compression on it  ..I dunno I like the original better  if you love Benefit stick to the original mix
B00ESF285S|3.0|I bought this for the grandkids to read.  It is not one of their favorites yet but since I have so many other Dr. Seuss books as they get older I think they will enjoy the book.

B001ANSSDC|5.0|Great Book!  Highly recommend!  You have to read it to understand :-)  The only thing I don't like is having Amazon require more words to accept a rating??????
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Addictive. I fight my son over the solutions. It's great fun to have it around and I am recommending it to all my friends.

0312427999|5.0|This book is the most conciser,lucid piece i have ever read on the current economic stranglehold of 'fearmongering' capitalism done on a international basis.  This is a must book for every home,school and political office.
1439156816|5.0|Having just 'won' this year's NaNoWriMo challenge (55K at end of Nov, but still finishing the story), I found Stephen King's insight a welcome assurance that I haven't gone totally bonkers in my drive to write a novel of fiction.<br /><br />Many of his points felt true to me because he writes about his own development in writing and some of his observations make sense to me now. They might not make sense to people that haven't attempted the wonderful rush of creativity, and the frustration of forgetting that one 'perfect' word, that is apparently universally experienced by writers, but there are more then enough stories and observations to entertain any fan of writing.<br /><br />This is not only for writers, to be sure. But I do believe that there is insight that can be gained for those that are, at least for those of us that are amateurs.<br /><br />Let me add that I have rarely laughed out loud from a non-fiction book, but the way he discusses several points, have left me in stiches.<br /><br />I recommend this book because of the witty and clear insights that are expressed honestly, with a dash of self deprecation, and the sometimes stoic perception of the life of a writer. I think it is very clear I will never attain the level of financial and popular success he has, but as he states in the book, that's not really the point. If we write because we enjoy it, then it's worth the effort.<br /><br />I will conclude only by saying that this could have been subtitled, &#34;A Memoir TO the Craft&#34;.
1423140605|5.0|I feel sad because I only have the next book and then I'll have to wait one year to read the end of the series. New book, same quest and new adventures now with all the seven heroes together!!!
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|I have always enjoyed the 007 movies and this one was not like the others but it was very good.  I look forward to more movies about 007 in the future.
B000002LSV|5.0|I love this CD.  It has a great beat and works well for me on the tread mill.  I also listen to into in the car.

142311339X|5.0|Great book! A lot like the Percy Jackson & The Olympians books but with new characters and new stories. Looks like the series is going to be as goos as the previous one.
B00594XOZU|5.0|You have  to update kik to be able to login. It is working perfectly for me right now but it just looks completely different
1439153663|5.0|Great book. Keeps you wondering what will happen next. Interesting look at this time period. Well written. Will try to read other books by this author.
B00B5HQL50|5.0|The best Bond film - EVER.  Daniel Craig makes you forgot that anyone else ever played James Bond.  Judy Dench should have been nominated for an Oscar for her portrayal of M.
B005L38QHA|5.0|Is my first gaming mouse and I love it! I never thought it was so useful. Very happy with it.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|I have always been amazed with world war two, and the guns in this game are amazing. I play with my friends all the time.
B003AXAS60|1.0|Apparently a cute toy, but after some months his ears are tearing apart, so now my kids have a no-ear-dog.
B002LC8HF0|5.0|I have now read this trilogy twice.  I am not sure what caused me to pick it back up the second time, but I couldn't be happier that I did.  This is a story that contains everything I feel a book/series should be: humor, despair, love, hate, ignorance, brilliance, and all the other dualities of the world that could possibly be thrown into a single story.  I recommend this series to each and every one of you with complete and utter adoration for Brandon Sanderson's ability to write a truly epic story.  I always finish good books with a hunger for more to read, but this time I feel completely fulfilled.  It has become my favorite story that I have ever read.  I hope you find as much enjoyment from it as I have... Twice (and probably many more)
1423140591|5.0|Percy is back and has new friends!!! Great book just as I thought it was going to be. I'll keep reading.
B00G3Q6VPS|5.0|True hardcore fans of Britney Spears understands why this album is truly personal...and she has come along way to release her feelings in to an entire album....each song has a personal meaning and only true fans will love it and understand it.....this is by far her best work and her voice is brilliant and back to what i heard in her 3rd album and im loving it...i cant stop listening to it
B00DNB9RXO|5.0|fantastic game with a really cool art style. it looks great and plays great. The gravity controls are really cool. I really enjoy this game.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Disappointed with there being limited options to watch movies.  Need more video watching options.  Not everyone uses Netflix or has hbo.  Otherwise, its great for exercise videos through youtube.
B0058YPLA2|1.0|I absolutely love this show.  I also hate it when people post reviews that have nothing to do with the product itself, but rather with Amazon's handling of the order. . . but I couldn't help myself.  I just got this directly from Amazon.  The outer slipcase was damaged--clearly worn from handling, etc.  What amazed me, however, was the Wal-Mart price sticker on the slipcase!  Seriously.  How on earth did this happen.  There is shinkwrap around the clamshell that appears to be the original shrinkwrap, but I don't trust it at all.  This is going back to Amazon.  Is this someone's idea of a joke?  I've ordered several thousand dollars worth of stuff from Amazon over the past few years, and never had a problem.  This is the third item I'm returning in the last two months (A damaged book, and a pair of Levis that were not even close to the marked size were the other two.).  Frankly, I'm not sure how often I'll order in the future.
B00DJ80VLS|3.0|I think it will grow on me and my rating may improve. DT are masters but as of now this isn't a masterpiece.
B00D2CYV9E|5.0|This film deserved to be in the motion picture theatres. The movie studios thought it to &#34;gay&#34;.  Michael Douglas and Matt Damon just were superb and omg Debbie Reynolds nailed mama Liberace! I didn't even realize it was her till the credits rolled. This film deserved numerous academy awards. Thanks HBO for putting it into production and giving it visibility....quality all the way!
