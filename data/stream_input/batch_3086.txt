B00BD99JMW|1.0|read this one for closure- but read it very quickly. If you stop to think about any of it, the plot falls to pieces.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|will buy this game. enjoyed the story line.  the hidden objects were not too hard or too easy to find. would recommend this game.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|This book is a fabulous combination of quotable research, personal experiences and practical suggestions for ways to change your behavior to have an impact. I just retired from a 40 year work life and have lived every experience Sheryl describes. i wish i had had her advice on how to change my behavior. It would have had such an impact on my career and on those around me. But it's not too late! i'm giving a copy to every person I know - female and male - and will (hopefully effectively) speak up when I see something that limits us all from meeting our full potential.
B0000DZ3IG|5.0|Why can't we have more \\"FEEL GREAT\\" movies produced?  All the \\"SAW\\" movies and such (which are great for what they present), can't mask the beauty of the holidays!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Lots of fun! Totally addicting. We have a hard time putting it down! I just wish it didn't take so long for the lives to regenerate. Haha :)
031623480X|5.0|I went on a gluten free diet over 10 years ago to help with asthma. A surprising \\"side effect\\" was that for the first time in 40 years I had a clear mind. The fog just lifted. Now 14 years later I'm experiencing some mental decline (I work in engineering) and this has been deeply disturbing to me. On Dr. Mercola's site, this book was referenced and I quickly sought it out. I'm another one who's racing through the book as it connects one dot after another. Dr. Perlmutter talks about all the brains \\"killers\\" and it's not just gluten. I personally didn't realize how many of these killers I eat on a daily basis and had no idea what I was doing to myself.....and I thought I was doing great!!! Dr. Perlmutter is obviously very intelligent (at 19 was a Junior in college) has a vast background on the subject and cites many fascinating studies and personal experience that blow apart conventional diet knowledge. To me this isn't a \\"diet\\" book. It's a book about what our food choices are doing to us and how small, relatively easy changes can greatly impact our current and future health. I was greatly relieved to find out that the brain does indeed regenerate itself. This book is a fabulous education in what causes dementia, ADHD, epilepsy, depression and even alzheimers and what we can do to avoid falling victim.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Amazing book. Hard to tear away from. Keeps you on the edge of your seat in some points. And is very sultry and sexy. But I don't recommend you read any of them while your significant other is away (like a deployment like mine is).
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|I was fascinated by her story.  She gave a good background of her family and the political climate at the time.
B000BEZQ0Y|5.0|One of my favorite sound tracks ever, in absolutely perfect condition. So happy! The sender kept it in very good condition and it got to me in a nice, short time
B000JMKNV0|5.0|Genius! Simply must read to understand. Even if you've already seen the movie.<br /><br />I read this faster than any other novel in the last ten years. Lehane has his finger on the pulse of psychological terror, and the blood is racing. Pick it up, trust me.
0765350386|5.0|This is the first of Brandon Sanderson's books I've read outside of the Alcatraz series. I was a little hesitant at first to read anything else of his because I had heard that he did a lot of heavy world-building that made for interminably long, dull books. I now know that whoever told me that was dead wrong. The world of Mistborn: The Final Empire is exceptionally well-built, but not in a way that the story gets bogged down with description. You get to learn about the rules of Sanderson's magic system as the main character, Vin, learns them.<br /><br />In Mistborn, there are two classes of people: skaa--essentially peasants--and nobles. Found among the noble families is an ability called Allomancy, or the ability to metabolize certain metals (&#34;burn&#34; them) to give them superpowers, basically. Different metals have different effects, ranging from enhanced senses to emotion manipulation to the Magneto-like ability to Push or Pull metal. There are ten different Allomantic metals, each with a different ability associated with it. An Allomancer is born with the ability to burn either only one of these metals or all of them. Those who can burn all ten are exceedingly rare and are called Mistborn.<br /><br />At the beginning of the book, Vin is part of a crew of skaa in the capital city of Luthadel who survive financially by scamming nobles out of their money. She is the only girl on the crew, and this puts her in a difficult position, since girls in the city often end up in brothels. None of the other people on the crew are really her friends and she has been abused enough that she is suspicious of everyone. She has survived thus far by being her crew leader's &#34;good luck charm&#34;--the nobles they scam always seem more gullible when she is around. One day she and her crew are approached by a man who identifies himself as Kelsier. Kelsier recruits Vin to his own crew and tells her that she is something very rare--a skaa Mistborn.<br /><br />Kelsier and his crew are planning to overthrow the tyrannical ruler of the Final Empire, a man known only as the Lord Ruler. Everyone believes him to be immortal--a god who cannot be killed. He is such a powerful Allomancer and can inexplicably heal such extensive injuries that all previous rebellions have failed miserably. However, Kelsier has discovered something he calls the Eleventh Metal that he believes is the key to killing the Lord Ruler.<br /><br />One of my favorite things about this book was that I never knew what was going to happen next. Kelsier lays out a plan to overthrow the Lord Ruler, but things keep going wrong in ways I never would've expected. Despite that, Vin, Kelsier, and the rest of the crew manage to adapt and keep going. The fight scenes were also excellent--never a dull moment.<br /><br />Another great quality of The Final Empire is the characters. None of them were flat; they all felt real to me. Over the course of the book, you can see Vin transform from this abused, suspicious street thief into a confident (even dangerous) young woman. At first when Kelsier takes her in she is suspicious of everything he does because everyone she's ever known has always betrayed her. But as Kelsier teaches her about her Allomancy and includes her in his plans and treats her well, she starts to be able to trust, and that transformation is amazing to watch.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone who likes high fantasy. The world Sanderson has built is well thought-out and very cool, his characters are dynamic, and the story is complex and keeps you on your toes. I can't wait to see where it goes with the next book.<br /><br />Review also seen on GoodReads.
B00CRS88IO|1.0|Historical accuracy was very poor.  The author lifted descriptions and scenes blatently from the James Bond Books.  I read historical fiction to learn HISTORY.  Not some authors fantasy.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|Great book for an easy, but compelling read. Had me always wanting to know what was coming next. Great book for young women.
B002VPE1WK|2.0|The price was cheap and so was the bag. The top handle of the bag broke off two weeks after purchase and the shoulder straps are starting to separate from the bag.  I do like how you can customize the internal compartmental sections.  I am not a hardcore photographer so I thought this bag would last a little longer.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Really fun and entertaining game.  I get lost in the game and can not stop playing. I also love the graphics.
B002C6A6N6|4.0|Good quality. Video looks better than episodes of friends on standard DVD.  It is in 4x3 format as originally aired. One case arrive with a broken flip tab inside. No damage to any discs and the case is still functinal. The rest were perfect.  The entire boxed set is about the size of a 10&#34; cube.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|This uno-game is just perfect for any uno lover out there.It's just like the classic uno game.It's well worth it in my Book.
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|Good plot, great characters. Very imaginative as I've come to expect from Sanderson. Hope to see more books in this series.
B00555X8OA|4.0|Proves some basic intuitions we may have had about biases in decision making. Makes you reflect and leads to better quality decision making
B0064MGU98|5.0|Well written with great acting. It will hook you right in. Looking forwards to seeing what the following seasons bring.
B00C061I3K|5.0|I love this cd! The music is amazing what more could you ask for in a great group of songs!
B00AN0KGWE|5.0|Love this show. Great characters, great scenery. Sometimes the supernatural stuff is a little distracting and slightly corny, but this is still a great series. And it's also sexy. Lol
0316055433|4.0|I rarely take on books more than 500 pages, largely because I fear they will bog down, as they often do, and because there are so many good books to read, I rarely dally with anything too long. Not to mention a 100 page rule – if the book isn’t interesting enough by then, I’m done.<br />Oddly, this season alone, several great writers have released very long books, including the previously reviewed and much admired Elizabeth Gilbert, and Donna Tartt tops the lot at 770 pages.<br />For those of you also fans of The Secret History, released twenty years ago, this third novel is long awaited and has received mostly positive reviews. Thus, as the days grow shorter and winds pick up, seemed a good time to curl up on the couch with a great big book.<br />It is a truly big book, not only in heft but in depth of human experience. A few characters dominate the narrative and they are all a captivating, my favorite, Boris, a ne’er do well Russian &eacute;migr&eacute;, dark at heart but light of spirit, whose voice is pitch-perfect and often hilarious. However this novel is about Theo: orphaned at thirteen when a bomb blast rocks the Metropolitan Museum and in an odd twist of fate ends up walking away with a famous painting, The Goldfinch, by the Dutch painter, Carel Fabritius. You may remember the little gem: a golden bird chained at one leg to his perch. Ah, a metaphor is born.<br />Theo, chained to the memory of his mother’s tragic death, his survivor guilt, the post-traumatic stress that ensues, to his self-serving, gambling-addicted father, and to loneliness. And, as it turns out, chained to the painting itself, which serves as both anchor and tormentor, and ultimately salvation.<br />Tartt’s descriptive prose is scintillating. Many scenes, occasionally too long, and dialogues, also occasionally too long, nonetheless enthrall the reader, as we move through a decade of Theo’s personal apocalypse. Through drug and alcohol-ridden escapades, thugs, well-meaning socialites, unrequited love, lost hopes and ultimate redemption, Tartt now and then drops in an allusion to Dickens, as if the reader was not already aware that this novel is an homage to Oliver Twist and David Copperfield, among others.<br />I loved Dickens for the same reason that I so much appreciated this book – for the detail and the vividness of characters. We take the journey with them, which makes for great fiction. Tartt also peppers the narrative with profound observances related to relationships and the supremacy of friendship. She also deftly illuminates the weaknesses of the social services system, and the adult failure to fully understand the mind of an adolescent, as well as the human kindnesses that make up for that.<br />Curl up on the couch reading, for sure, but make sure to buckle your seatbelt, because the trip from NYC to Las Vegas to Amsterdam and back again is a wild ride and goes faster than you might imagine.requited love, lost hopes and ultimate redemption, Tartt now and then drops in an allusion to Dickens, as if the reader was not already aware that this novel is an homage to Oliver Twist and David Copperfield, among others.<br />I loved Dickens for the same reason that I so much appreciated this book – for the detail and the vividness of characters.

B00G32OMF8|1.0|They should have stopped after the 2nd movie with leaving it all to the imagination.<br /><br />I looked forward to seeing this movie for a long time. When I finally got my hands<br />on the DVD, ready to jump into the next chapter --I was completely let down.<br /><br />I read that it had stellar reviews from critics, which should have been my first clue.<br />Critics seem to like the movies with a lot of foul language and negativity, which is pretty<br />much the only way I can describe this horrible movie. Constant foul language does not make<br />a film artsy...it makes the characters come across as too ignorant to find a better word to use.<br />It did not live up to what I hoped for.  I am glad I just got it from Redbox instead of purchasing the dvd, although it<br />was still not worth the $1.30 and 2 hours of my time.
B009LDCZ7I|3.0|Great show, but you can already feel that the story cannot go on forever. The secrets from season 1 slowly begin to reveal themselves. After that I'm not sure what else they can grab me with.
B005L38QK2|5.0|This is absolutely just right for gaming in general, and especially for playing Diablo 3.  No other mouse or trackball I've tried has worked as well.
B00EEDJM2Q|3.0|Just started, will see how challenging it becomes. I may increase the number of stars later.  I do like this type of game.
B00CZ7OC46|4.0|As I think 37signals as a reference &#34;remote work done right&#34; company, their book on remote work isn't totally great. The Good: good amount of good advice, especially it is the first book on remote working you read; great pictures; good amount of personal experience and examples. The Bad: sort of controversy: in one chapter authors say that you should get entire team remote for 3 months to understand the benefits, some chapters later - that a couple of people, part of the team - is enough; much of the content is pretty generic and obvious.<br /><br />To sum up: the great point to start when you think of remote work implementation, but totally not the whole reference.
B00BAXFAOW|3.0|Good, but not his best work. Some good chapters, but felt like it tried to stretch the David and Goliath concept a little too far.  Hope his next one is more engaging.
B00G32VYDG|3.0|i watched it to the end that's the only reason i gave it 3 stars. It was just average the story was predictable,  I love all the actors and expected more.
B00241YHMU|4.0|Awesome!! This movie is fantastic and not even a bad option for the kids to check out. I'd recommend to all!
0316204366|5.0|Another great read from Gladwell! His ability to tell a story while changing the way you think is surpassed by none.
B00D7OMNXS|1.0|(In re-reading my review I realize it is a bit spoilery and ranty, so be forewarned)<br /><br />I'm afraid this is an example of a great group of very talented people getting together and making a movie that I absolutely DID NOT want to see made.<br />The trailer was like seeing a beautiful, perfect apple. Then the movie was like taking a bite of the apple and finding out it is just sawdust covered in wax.<br /><br />I imagine this would be my conversation with the writers/director/whoever:<br />Wouldn't it be great to see Tony Stark suffering serious post-traumatic stress?<br />My answer is No.<br /><br />How about seeing a constantly malfunctioning prototype Iron Man armor?<br />Nope. That would be a terrible idea.<br /><br />Well, we can have Col. James Rhodes as Iron-War-Patriot-Machine, who gets to do next to nothing.<br />NO, I tells ya!<br /><br />Did I mention that Iron Man's armor constantly falls apart?<br />You have not mentioned that yet, but I NEVER want to see that happen in any Iron Man movie.<br /><br />Um, alright, we'll have The Mandarin in the movie (Great!), he'll be played by Ben Kingsley (Excellent!), he will be of indeterminate nationality (I like it!) BUT . . . it turns out it is a cheap and embarrassing trick where he ends up being just a goofball actor (wrong, wrong and WRONG! Horrible idea!).<br /><br />OK, OK. Well, we'll use the Extremis Virus (that could work) to make people into super-heated, fire-breathing, exploding beasties that can tear Iron Man's 42 different types of armor (wait, what?) into pieces (NO!)<br /><br />Tony will run around wearing just PARTS of his armor, stumbling and bumbling his way around until flaming Pepper (whazza!?) rises from the fire to save him! (Now you've completely lost me. And I am a lifelong fan of comics and superheroes.)<br /><br />Then I would say, \\"Well, thank heaven we had this conversation and I stopped Marvel from making a mind-bendingly horrible Iron Man movie.\\" Wait a minute. They MADE that movie?!! It earned over 1 billion bucks?! But its horrible! Its idiotic! Its . . . And then my nose starts bleeding again and I have to just give up.<br /><br />Anyway, thanks for allowing that rant. I did think this film was just FULL of terrible ideas that ruined it for me. However, the scene where Iron Man saves the people falling from Air Force One is excellent. I loved the special feature about the sky-divers that pulled it off. Those people were absolutely awesome. (Then the director blew it in the movie by having Tony NOT be in the armor and then having him crash it like an idiot into an oncoming truck where his armor (of course) FALLS APART!<br /><br />On a positive note, the Agent Carter short-film was PERFECT. WAY better than IM3. And the kid who works with Tony is NOT annoying and gives a really good performance.<br /><br />You know, I loved the trailer for Iron Man 3, then I felt completely cheated by the movie. I also LOVE the trailers for Thor 2 and Captain America 2. I pray I don't get cheated on THOSE two. In fact, I feel all panicky, like the trauma of having seen Iron Man 3 has made me incapable of going to anymore Marvel movies. What will happen next?!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|The only thing I would change is when I send requests, I would like to choose only candy crush players like on the web.
B0084TWN9K|3.0|I didn't see the award winning status. The short stories were well written about simple people living simple lives in rather plain locations.  Some may find them quaint stories but award winning?
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|I enjoy the witty levels and  clever graphics. I also like the quick banter between the characters before various levels.
B00000J7A2|5.0|Because this is one of the all time great albums ever recorded.  It was Captain Beefheart's first major label release and is just as wonderful<br />all these many years later as when I first listened.  Idiot reviewers tried to apply their limited knowledge of music to it when it came out, but they had no ears.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Before I downloaded it I though it was just a seek and find game. Turned out to be way better. Really gets your brain working.
B00BXDOSXS|4.0|it works and is one of a very few that actually will work on the variety of video types out there.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Great book easy to read but makes you think. Really Enjoyed the parallel between the two main characters the most.
B004RLO0EA|5.0|A solid soundtrack without any dull songs used as fillers. It has quickly become a favorite at my office, and is always on my iPod when I travel to do maintenance at remote sites.
B00DIJQAI6|4.0|Sonic is great....Grandkids love it and spend lots of time amusing themselves ....graphics are good and game is challenging at different levels...
B00FEHXISA|5.0|Good movie , it will keep you on the edge of your seat. I can't wait to see more movies set in the Marvel Universe.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|The game is very fun and can bring the whole family together, but the energy runs out fast and the gems used to buy more are really hard to obtain. Other then that, it is a very fun and amazing game.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|I got the game for free then purchased 5dollars worth of additional lives and the longest it lets me play is 20 minutes.
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|Can't sleep great to play late night. Got it as a free download. Great for young children. No blood  or dismemberment.
B008HK3XKO|5.0|This is a very nice case. It looks good, is sturdy, and protects my kindle. It is easy to open and close and I can use the kindle with the cover on, plus I can charge it with the cover on. The magnetic closure keeps the lid closed and also triggers the kindle's screen to turn off when I close it or turn on when I open it. It's easy to put my kindle in or take it out, and holds it securely. It even turns into a nice stand for hands-free reading.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Excellent! Could not put the book down. The twist and turns we're true Grisham. Could not relax until I finished the book. Jake is a true champion!
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Good book I liked the book a lot it was very interesting you should make another one it was good
B00BHNR1KQ|4.0|This is pretty good for a horror flick. The plot was not great, but solid and the acting was certainly better than most of the cheap crap that you find in this genre. By the end you could kind of tell what the kicker was going to be, but still this was a great choice for a dark Halloween night.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|I no longer use Facebook for a number of reasons but I cannot get rid of this memory hogging app.  It stays on my device keeping me from downloading things.  I called Amazon help and they said I am stuck with it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So HAPPY it's on kindle fire!!!!!  LOVE IT!!!! Graphics so colorful it sucks you in, the best game on kindle fire!!!!
0307352153|3.0|This review written by an introvert. Got hard cover as a gift. Then got audio CD as a gift.<br /><br />PROS:<br />Lots of good research quoted.<br />Passionate advocacy of introverts' rights and entitlements.<br /><br />CONS:<br />Haphazard organization of concepts.<br />Unnecessary criticism of extroverts<br />Mixing up distinct dimension of introversion-extroversion with other distinct dimensions related to neuroticism and sensation seeking. This chaotic mix-up undermines the central educational purpose of the book.<br />Inappropriate discouragement of Social Anxiety label in situations even where such label is warranted. This could lead persons with Social Anxiety Disorder (vs. Ordinary Shyness) to not seek treatment.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Truly a book you cannot put down.  A great plot, courtroom action and everyday relatable characters.  In the end, the good guys don't necessarily win in court but they win nonetheless. Bravo!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I liked the story from page one.  I liked that it had many turns that were not expected. You feel close to all the characters; you'll feel their joy and pain.
0679890475|5.0|I recently attended a baby shower that requested in addition to the traditional gifts that we bring a favorite childhood book for the baby. This &#34;New To Be Mom&#34; wanted lots of books to read to her child ,as she remembered the warm special feelings of  being read to herself.<br /><br />This was one of my favorite books, so that wasn't a difficult choice. However, the fact it came in the card board version....so our new family member could &#34;read it to herself&#34;, as she became  more independent was great selling point for me. I liked that fact she would be able to &#34;read&#34; this without her parents worrying of ripped pages or additional art work &#34;ruining&#34; it. I also liked that the  size was just right for a small child to hold. It was nice to know that sticky finger prints left covered in Jam could be wiped away easily as well.<br /><br />This was a great choice, and I was happy I was given the option to  purchase it as a &#34;LU&#34; book, which would not only allow her to enjoy the story but the process of &#34;reading&#34; to herself as she grows.<br /><br />** when she gets older enough to appreciate it  she will receive my vintage copy.
B00DQVST76|5.0|Love it-full CD of entire MDNA tour-sound was excellent and included all songs from the tour. One of best tour cds in awhile.
B00BQHA0UQ|3.0|I have a couple other of Carlos albums and love them, however this one is definitely not of this category. I was bored with it.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|Love the Beatles-this was one of the best mixes of their songs. I just recently saw the Las Vegas show and had to get the CD after seeing the show.
B00F8H0LM2|3.0|I  down loaded this hoping to like  it as I had enjoyed prior angry birds games. I found  the levels  on this game were too difficult to master. After  having spent so many hours trying to do the impossible,  my choice would be to delete this game and forget I ever saw it. I like  being challenged, but I don't like it when the challenges are impossible to conquer.<br />I am glad it was free...  if  not I would be kicking my self...
B008JFUO72|5.0|Excellent mix of adventure, action and humor. My favorite of the Iron Man movies.  Ben KIngsley and Guy Pearce were two incredible villains with Ben Kingsley poking fun at a classical theatrical background.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|Refreshingly simple yet powerful read on the mechanics of how we form habits, how to stop inefficient ones, and implement new empowering ones.
B00F35BV64|5.0|Excellent movie-action, adventure and humor made this a fun sci fi movie to enjoy. Watched it several times as a rental.
B0055SWM08|1.0|Played original download to last frame, all of my pearls disappeared, got a message to re-down load  game, now back to frame one, pearls gone, can't get purchase of jewel finder to reappear. Just not happy with wasting time &amp; $
B00ESY7QXI|5.0|Beautiful and vivid version of the classic story. The cinematography, costumes, makeup, scenery and  sets brought back the glamour of the 20's.  I enjoyed this version more than the 70's version with Mia Farrow and Robert Redford. Leonardo DiCaprio and Tobey Maguire were excellent.
B00CUB5PNY|5.0|One of my favorites. I bought it for iPad as well as android so I can play on all devices. Love all plastic games!
1416972250|1.0|The book was shown to be delivered to my sister, as a birthday gift and she never received the book. I was very disappointed
B00FRN2QZM|5.0|They'll be around for awhile, this album is stunning! Crash love set this album, every album sets the next after the next.. Great job!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed it.  This is a Classic Grisham which brings you back to his early novels.  Hard to put down.
B000VLE3IS|2.0|Description said new and shrink wrapped. Item received was in good condition but it was not in shrink wrap and was used. Disc 1 had some minor scratches but did not skip. Otherwise all was good with purchase. Quick shipping was nice.
B00G32OER4|4.0|This was an awesome creepy flick. Beautifully scary and should be considered a Halloween must see. If you love scary movies you must see this one.
B0098XY5VK|4.0|This is a very fun game. It is a little challenging with be able to focus and move fast but lots of fun.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I was very happy when Candy Crush became available on Kindle Fire. I love this game. Sometimes I get error messages when sending friends lives or trying to use lives I've been sent.
B00BSW6F26|4.0|This game has beautiful pictures and there is help to finish the game. it is a little tuff but with the help I got I was able to finish it.
B005HEFB6M|5.0|This is the series where we meet all those fabulous aliens and technologies for the first time.  The adventures are more similar to the original Star Trek series and just as arresting.  Thanks to Amazon Prime Instant Videos I am able to compare the 3 post Star Trek: Next Generation series side by side and in my opinion Enterprise is the best.
B004GJDQT8|4.0|I really like this app because I can shop online with my tablet at anytime I want.  I do a lot of my shopping with amazon; I can trust I will be treated honestly
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|I really am enjoying the novel but I wish that King would stop referring back to The Shining as much as he does.  This novel stands enough on its own without continual reference to Danny's past .  Refer once and move on.
B00ATPVA78|3.0|This game wasn't as interesting as the others I have played. It was not very interesting to play and very slow
B0049J2BSM|5.0|Always a classic movie. Never gets old.  Watched it with three people that don't care for cartoons and they loved it.
B008AIGWVA|3.0|This is very cute and fun to watch. This would be enjoyed by people of all ages. I love watching the different things he did like talking on the phone
B009LDCZDC|5.0|Very exciting storyline and suspenseful action.  Acting is superb.  If you have the time, watching all the episodes back to back is preferred.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|I had a lot of fun with this game and g5 has lots of other good games I have played.
B00948EPOQ|5.0|Nice short movie. Beautiful pictures of Paris. Pretty good acting. Classic WA, obviously; some of it, you have seeing before (nothing wrong with watching some movies more than once).
B00A0SQBDM|4.0|I really liked this game because of the beautiful pictures and how challenging the hidden objects were. I got this game on my tablet and also on my computer.
B00004T9VY|5.0|Insightful, tender and moving as always.<br />This is poetry via music by a sensitive and gentle soul.<br />Buy this !
B009KS4XRO|2.0|Bingo blitz is way too greedy with winning bingos... not enough daily chips. Not enough big wins or mega wins.... greedy greedy greedy. Beware!
B00004VW0V|5.0|Once again the Master Story Teller via music is at his best !<br />Never disappointing and so relevant even to this day.
B008K8VDPU|5.0|I think it is truly the best piano app, because it looks like a real piano instead of colored dots on the screen, so it's realistic as a piano app can get.

0061998494|5.0|Never heard of Craig Ferguson until we saw him when he hosted the 4th of July: Boston Pops Celabration.<br />NOW love him and watch him every night !<br />DO remember him now from the Drew Carey Show and loved him as Nigel the boss !<br />He is one of the most brilliant, creative, entertaining individuals we have today !<br />One of America's national treasures.<br />He gives a truthful insight into his personal life and struggles and I can't think of a better guy to have the success he has and hope he gets much more !<br />Thank you for all of the joy and laughter you have given us !
B007Y5IAV0|4.0|It is not the same singer than in System Of A Down, but Tankian is awesome!! I wish more from him!! Really nice album
B001PPLJJ0|5.0|A deeply moving yet disturbing story.<br />It portrays the individuals of the time who got up in the problems and struggles and evil of the times.<br />A compassionate ending.<br />Brilliant acting.<br />Highly recommended.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Works better with accelerated charger. Should have came with the Kindle but it is a good replacement. I recommand this  as a must have.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is so addictive that I don't want to put it down. And u don't have to buy the next level sets.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|Money well spent, worth the 7 dollars, i love the game, its better than the batman game for sure' i cant stop plying it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is an addicting app! You may find yourself crushing candy instead of doing the things you need to get done!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I enjoy the addictive play of this game...I love it!!! And my son enjoys it as well! We will be paying for a long time
B00AECGQF2|5.0|My four year old daughter loves this game.So much to do especially washing and<br /><br />shampooing the hair 5 stars !
0763644765|5.0|This is an awesome book.  Very cute.  My toddler loves reading it.  Great colors and pictures to keep everyone entertained.
B00A3NQNUU|3.0|Every time I update dragonvale it restarts all of my progress. The first time it happened I thought it was a game glitch, but this time I when I updated it again it happened again. I really like this game but I'm not going to play it.
B00C5ZORES|5.0|Fall Out Boy is one of my favorite bands and this album doesn't disappoint. Catchy, fast-paced songs with clever lyrics dominate the playlist. &#34;Just One Yesterday&#34; is one of my favorites, although honestly.... I can't think of one song on here I forward over. I like 'em all!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Astounding and view changing.  I'm buying this book for relatives to read.  Gives me affirmation and answers the question of why we are here.
B00BOLE7X0|5.0|Daniel Day-Lewis is the most talented actor alive. His performance is surreal. I think this is closest impersonation we will ever see of Lincoln. A MUST watch.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|It was a read, once you began, you couldn't resist, until the story ended.  The characters were so complete, they felt like neighbors.
B005DJGMQE|5.0|Great movie, nice primer for my Washington DC trip coming up soon. Spoiler alert, President Lincoln is shot and unfortunately does not pull through.
B00C6Q6OAG|1.0|The ad did not match what I got.  The ad showed a boy doll in a red jacket and a girl doll.  That is what I wanted.  I was unaware of the characters names, which read in the ad as the two girl dolls that I got.  I feel that this was false advertisement, and I would have returned it, but I got it two days before my niece's birthday, so I didn't have time to get another gift.  Although she liked the dolls, it was a big let down that she didn't get the boy doll that she wanted.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I bought another one because is great
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|works great:-) I can not wait to use it more. this app works for school and meetings it is probably the best note book app I have ever owned
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game! I started playing it on my iPhone and am so happy it is now available on my kindle!!!
0345803485|5.0|The book exceeded my expectations, was in very good condition. Good deal for the money. I recommend this to anyone.
B00FPGSPQU|1.0|This was very disappointing. All the things they did were just like in part one and two. Don't waste your time or money
B009LQKHIO|5.0|First I read books on my husband's Kindle so he didn't read the book I did.  I don't typically write reviews but this book was wonderful.  I enjoyed the story line the characters that have been introduced and want to know more.  Will be getting the series today!
B008QTV3X0|4.0|I only watched the &#34;pilot&#34;.  I did like it, it kept my attention.  But I don't think to the point of paying $2.99 per episode - maybe once a month or so.  If it were to be added to Prime, I would surely watch the series.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|Great movie.  True to the original Star Trek with fun changes.  The actors for Spock and Kirk play the part well.
B004SMDJ9U|5.0|Love the show, it came pretty swift in the mail. Happy all together with my purchase will definitely make more in the near future!
B000HWZ4A2|5.0|I just watched this film on TCM, admittedly for the first time from beginning to end.  If anyone needs inspiration to fight the true fight, to demand that principle must prevail over conformity, and to \\"never let the bastards get you down\\", then buy this DVD and send it to your friend in need.  Since I need a little inspiration for myself, from time to time, I just bought a DVD for myself.
B00DXLO0D6|3.0|I love having the complete series in one collection and the cost.  However I hate the fact the first season has been colorized.  That isn't the way it was made and shown on TV so why would we want it that way now? I will have to purchase the first season (again) separately if I actually want black and white instead of the crap colorization.  I also am not a fan of the way the DVDs are in the box.  Instead of being on individual sleeves like most multi sets they are stacked up on top of one another.  You have to remove each DVD to get to the one you want and them back again.  Not user friendly.  What a shame!
B004NDVK1I|5.0|Rory was a master guitar player equaled by none and emulated by many. Too bad we lost him way too soon.
B002OKGJUO|4.0|i love this movie. nosferatu is one of, if not THE creepiest characters in film. the only reason that i dont rate it as a 5 is that it is actually too clean. without the dust and scratches, you can see the make-up too clearly which takes away from what made it disturbing.
1439110123|3.0|Th first 200 hundred pages are truly outstanding. I enjoyed the history of oil so much. The discovery in the US and how Standard Oil become so big. I wish it even had more technical details about how they could pump oil from the depths and were able to transport it in the early days. But after page 230 or so it becomes unreadable. The author doesn't know how to separate important things from the unimportant things. The first 200 pages establish the oil scene. After that the book doesn't knwo which angle to choose. He simple can't handle the 7 companies and historical events that take place on different areas of the world. So he chooses the encyclopedia approach in a chronological way. Every little discussion between people is described. People are introduced that leave the story 5 pages later. The book lost its storyline.  I had to put it down. I switched to the seven sisters which was better to put the story together.
B00AACBJPI|2.0|This product work well as a hot shoe cover. One would have to lower one's hand when taking a picture which defeat the purpose for having a level when shooting the camera. It is above the eye piece therefore, you are left with the same problem you purchased the level for.
0061353248|3.0|I am enjoying the book, but There are some issues with it. As others have pointed out many of his results stem from lab test with students. It seems this is used for every scientific results as this is a group that has enough time to cooperate and can be easily found.<br /><br />Further he translates choices we make about candies and simple tasks to real life. And this is flawed. As basic marketing could have learned him, every buying decision is accompanied by perceived risk: social, functional, psychological, time, physical and financial. Decisions about candies lack a lot of these categories so the result of a test cannot be translated to a decision on things which do have a lot of perceived risk in the categories of time or psychological for instance.<br /><br />I also frowned when reading is chapter on zero cost. I don't understand why he does not bring his own theory about relativity into play. Zero is infinite better than one, isn't it? So a pricedrop from one to zero means results indeed change a lot.<br /><br />And i cannot believe he really thinks that supply demand curves are linear. That's classroom simplification. Ever heard of psychological pricepoints? Things are charged 1,99 instead of 2 in a supermarket for good reason. That should also make one careful about test with prices or rewards of less than a buck. This indicates somehow that it probably holds no real value. Nothing sensible is priced that low. So outcomes are highly debatable.<br /><br />Further, he keeps dismissing standard economic theory on the basis that some choices we make are irrational. My economics is rusty but one precondition for the rationality is that we are all perfectly informed and all information is transparant. And this does not apply in many real life situations, so economic models apply less well in these situations. They are not wrong as he puts it. This precondition is well accepted.<br /><br />Further, I would suggest that Dan takes a marketing class to explain manyof his results by another reason. He seems to think that many people (and especially economicists) don't know how that by conveying a certain promotional message we can lure people into buying something more expensive. Or that image is a intangible thung that holds value and therefore changes our decisions.<br /><br />And a whole Chapter on the cencept of placebo's? Really? You think there are still people who have never heard of that?<br /><br />Well i could go on, but i also enjoyed great parts of the book. Especially the last chapter where he talks about people easier taking a coke from a shared fridge, than a one dollar bill froma plate is interesting. He could discover that part and our deeper motivations behind that much better.<br /><br />One thing: why do all these type of books have to be 300+ pages? That's unnecessary and many of these popular \\"science\\" books repeat everything three times to reach that amount of pages. 100-150 would be much better. Opportunity for publishers here.
B00FEHXCIG|5.0|great movie the best Iron Man will order it again. and tell my friends about it. thank you for having it/
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is so addictive. Like that one can access it through Facebook and thus can continue same game on multiple devices.
B00E1LQ7Q0|5.0|I love this album! It really gets me moving in the gym. I love the extended versions of the songs.
B0001HAISG|5.0|One of my favorite movies!!! This one was a birthday present for a 4yo who loves Peter Pan. She loves it!
B00BR4QNJ0|4.0|samurai vs zombies defends 2 is awesome but to make more people like me to download this app then add the zombie side so you can be zombies that would be awesome.so if your reading this then please add zombie side.
B00DWFQ2N4|4.0|I like it but I think Part One of this album is better. This one has four or five worth relistening, but the first album, the whole thing rocks.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|Again, I bought this book for another person, so I personally don't know if I would like it, or not.  The person I got it for has read it three times, now!  I believe they would give it five stars!
B009XI7RF6|1.0|No clue if the game is good or not. Tried to download and open twice and it froze phone both times I opened it. Uninstalled. Again. :(
B008JFUNJQ|5.0|Missing vital plot of Valentine and Peter, but can be redeemed with some tweaking with a sequel of Peter the Hegemon and then Speaker for the Dead afterwards. The amount of plot in modern times needed for Peter's rise to power is a movie in it's own, which then needs to tie into Ender at the end (and beginning). Overall very faithful for the time allowed, but would have personally enjoyed it more if another 30 minutes was dedicated to parts being trimmed.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|hard to put down. great series can't wait to start the next book.in this world. so hopeless of a world so many secrets. great read.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Well I would never want to hurt the feelings of this author but I absolutely hated this book.  Not just the ending like some of the other reviews but really the entire book.  I don't know why she did the perspective of both Tris & Four, if the 2 books before did this then I would understand but why start now. I even felt that she only wrote some of the book. I see and feel her writing in some of the chapters and then I felt like it was a completely different person's thoughts in other chapters. Huge disappointment for me.
B00G9U7R2O|5.0|What a cute movie! My son who is 4 loved it! I won't lie...I think I loved it even more then he did lol!
B0083SBMBM|5.0|One of the best of the Marvel comic movies. Great action and great actors. Get this movie and you will watch it over and over again!
0316044695|4.0|Good book. I'm glad I decided to pick it up before the movie comes out. Just a solid story of an modern day warrior spirit.
B00A3AU9KI|5.0|I've bought other Belkin car chargers from Amazon that were FAKE, but this one was genuine.  I have been using it in my car and have not had trouble with it so far.  I would buy this product again.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Once I started I couldn't stop. It really makes you use the grey matter resting between your ears. It's been quite a while since I found a game so engaging. Keep up the great work..
B003G4W49C|5.0|Decided to check out this book before seeing the new movie.  Wasn't expecting it to be such a page turner.  How did I never hear of this story until now.  Great story and superbly written.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Excellent app, multiple functions. Easy to use.<br />I got it because I was having problem with my standard alarm clock, love it!
B000QI2ZWW|4.0|I thought Happy Feet was just going to be a cute children's movie - I didn't realize there was also a political agenda.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Everyone assumes the secret involves infidelity.  The secret is unimaginable and connects the characters to each other.  I could not put this book down.  There were so many twists and turns I was determined to see how it ended.  The tragedy in the end was heart wrenching.  I would recommend this to anyone looking a great book.
B001D09OAI|5.0|This is one of those great movies that has a lot of star power from actors early in their careers who went on to become huge.  It is their talent that made them become huge later and it is the same aggregate talent that made this movie a classic.  I have probably watched it at least 5 times over the years.  It is funny as hell and it also stands the test of time.
B009O5CLZY|4.0|this game is good but its a little bit confusing I think u would like it I give it 4 stars
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|very addictive game easy to loose yourself for hours at a time. whole family plays this game. fun for all ages
B009XI7RF6|3.0|Full versions are FREE right now on PLAY and iTunes and have three levels of IAP (unlock all books = $.99, Kids drawing mode = $1.99 and 10 Hints = $1.99).  PLAY store is now promoting version 3.02 and iTunes is promoting version 2.01.  I had to install both versions from those markets to find this out as the \\"Pandoodle Free\\" version links are down and have been replaced by the \\"Full\\" versions?<br /><br />The version here today has Flurry Analytics, begs for Facebook Likes, still has the lock up issues, doesn't have a Quit game option and will run in your cache unless you force close it.<br /><br />As for the game play, it is a decent game where the task is to connect colored spots. Crossing colored lines mix their colors and allow you to get from yellow crossing blue to green for example. Fewer number of lines is the real objective to win the task.<br /><br />With the permissions, IAP, Flurry analytics and a propensity for the developer to add undesirable permissions and features as the version levels increase, drops this to a game worthy of 3 stars but no more.
B00CHVJI08|5.0|FANTASTIC MOVIE GREAT FOR YOUNG AND OLD. LOTS OF LAUGHS. GREAT BUY. THIS WOULD MAKE A WONDERFUL CHRISTMAS GIFT FOR EVERY ONE
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|This book was interesting and gripping from the very beginning!  Now I need to go back and read them all again.  Great story!
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|If you are looking for a good book to curl up with, this could be the one for you. Very enjoyable read.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|i love this game. completely addictive!! the game levels take some thinking and I really enjoy that.  if only they would give power ups as prizes instead of having to purchase them all the time......
B00ECU4DPW|4.0|Typical My Little Pony fare, but the songs are catchy and the message of working together is always a good one to reinforce. My 8 year old loves the series and the movie didn't disappoint.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Great entertainment. Excellent casting of characters. A realistic look at how history has forced us to change our lives and expectations.
B00AHGSVKS|5.0|I have not read any of this author but will now start. Great book for science-fiction fans. Buy it now!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR WHAT SEEMS LIKE FOREVER FOR CANDY CRUSH TO BE AVAILABLE &amp; I MUST SAY THAT I AM GLAD THAT IT IS FINALLY AVAILABLE! IT'S AN AWESOME GAME &amp; VERY MUCH ADDICTIVE!!!!
B00COQTZLS|1.0|I am EXTREMELY unhappy.  I just paid for something that doesn't work as advertised.  I have used PI Pro on my iPhone for several years and really love it.  I wanted to be able to sync my information with my Kindle Fire HD 8.9 via Google Calendar and it doesn't work.  Amazon has dropped the ball on this.  Now I'm stuck with a purchase I can't use.
B0086700CM|4.0|Liked playing this with my son, but he likes Temple Run 2 better (he's 8) so, to save space, I removed this and kept #2... but this was fun!
B00EDF43MY|5.0|My three-year old loves it. She plays this game for at least an hour every day. My five-year old likes it as well.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|This was a fun game that my son really enjoyed playing... until it told me I needed an SD card for the updates.  :(  I have a kindle fire, it said it works with kindle fires... but only the ones with SD cards, apparently
B000JMKQX0|4.0|The book gives an in-depth  perspective on the human condition whereas the movie was more of an apocalyptic video game.
B006OCM0G0|3.0|Haven't played it as yet.  Can't rate at this time.  Will try in a few days.  Nothing more to say.
1401938906|5.0|I felt very intune with the tone of the author.  I, like her, have read or seen the same things or similar references on quantum physics and neuroscience.  She speaks to many of the same questions I've had in life. My biggest takeaway is how she experiments.  I've been experimenting with myself for quite some time, never in the way in which she frames the challenges for yourself.<br /><br />In fact it brought about a whole new viewpoint for me on why successful people track and challenge themselves daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly.  That which is tracked is able to get better.<br /><br />One of my life's mantra's is you don't know until you do.<br /><br />This book is a terrific mix of religion/spirituality, quantum physics, neuroscience, and personal responsibility wrapped around intrigue and curiosity for oneself.<br /><br />Highly recommend reading it.<br /><br />-Joe<br />[...]
B002M5E2DW|5.0|So simple, so profound. The law of attraction is a powerful force that we all should learn to harness. Read it.
B008602KQI|4.0|This film epitomizes today's life and death situations that ordinary people face. The choices we make all have life altering implications and ever so more, the true lesson here shows that violence breads more violence. Ultimately life is precious but as humans we can be so inhumane.
B00G32OER4|4.0|Decently creepy, definitely a good ghost story. It suffered from a few clichés but all in all stayed good and entertaining.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Cool never played anything better if you did not get this get I know deep deep down you know you want to get it click the button so much fun come on your killing everybody how fun is that!!!
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|I thought that was a fitting end to the sreies. Al the many and diverse plot lines were tied together nicely. The underlying theme was played out well and the finale was &#34;fitting&#34;. The potential for a sequel was a nice touch
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is my favorite. I always play this game first before I play any other game or read any other book,
B00F30S0Y0|5.0|Just like every other Arcade Fire album, I'm totally hooked. The songs are playing in my dreams. And I totally love that James Murphy produced the album. Right now, Porno is my favorite but I love so many of the songs. Anyway, awesome album!
B00594XOZU|1.0|This kik app does not work on my kindle. So I don't really like this one. I wish there was one for kindle fire.
B0030IIZ4M|5.0|OMG, a cleverly written story, full of imagination and a brilliant theme.  It touches the imagination of children AND adults.
B00AFCEIB0|4.0|I totally like this except one problem. I usually have to restore my tabs because it freezes up. Sometimes it just backs out to the home screen.
B00003CWNR|5.0|For years I did not see this movie because the title put me off for some silly reason...it is a Sunday afternoon favorite of mine and my family.  A story about a young man growing up in an orphanage in the fifties...his daring attempt to move outside his comfort zone and the results of that attempt..He grows up with the orphanage dr who is a somewhat inappropriate but very loving father figure.I think the moral is that there is no place like home, wherever that is AND that mother nature does not always choose who will be your parent.  It does have an adult subject matter which I feel is inappropriate for under 12.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I LOVE this game. I was so happy when I found it. It's really a teaching game or a puzzle.
B00009ZYC1|5.0|This movie is in my TOP THREE FAVORITES of all time!  Beauty is on the inside is how I would describe the theme of the movie.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I truly enjoyed this book. This book is a blessing to my marriage <3 Thank you so much. 2 thumbs up!!!
B00G3DA5VC|5.0|This movie was thought provoking with excellent acting.  Characters were believable and interesting. Plot was real life tempo but also adventurous.  I think this will most appeal to young viewers and parents of teens.  Loved it
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|This is like the best show ever. Almost everything of ot looks so realistic. And if you haven't seen it I recommend you to do so!
B005VPRETE|4.0|This was an excellent toy for a little girl.  She liked it quite a bit.  Again, I feel Lego objects are just too expensive.
B002QE3CTY|4.0|I read this book in about 3 days.  I didn't want to put it down.  I enjoyed it, but had to knock down a star because of the contradictions in the book.  For example, ********SPOILER***************** towards the end, after they stop the grievers, Newt asks about the Gladers who stayed behind.  We know they only kill one person per night, and they STOPPED the grievers, so why would they think the grievers attacked and killed them all.  There were other errors in the book along these lines.  Thomas would do something, and then a few chapters later, it was as if he didn't do it.  Overall, I thought this was an intriguing read- albiet, a scary thought that this could actually be where scientists take \\"saving the world\\"  I will definitely give book 2 a shot!
B0066WJLU6|5.0|This is a great app for all smartphone owners. This app is easy and effective flashlight tool for any purpose or environment.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It was so interesting I finished it in a day. I do not think that I would have though that would happen
B0093FNZT6|5.0|I have just finished reading this book. I read it almost non-stop because it is such an amazing and inspiring book. A must read for anyone on the spiritual path or dealing with life-death situations. Proof of Heaven  is a truly revolutionary book. I wholeheartedly recommend this amazing book.<br /><br />I have never heard of this book before. A few days ago a friend who is a doctor  mentioned it to me. Apparently “Proof of Heaven” is an international best seller.<br /><br />Dr. Eben M.D., a neurosurgeon and brain researcher at Harvard University was a typical sceptic with a brilliant scientific  mind until he fell ill in 2008 when a rare and severe form of bacterial infection attacked his brain and sent him into a deep coma. In fact, he was actually in a state of brain death and his doctors did not think that he would make it. But miraculously he did make it. He woke up after 7 days and made a full recovery. In itself this was a medical miracle. Even more amazing – he also remembered in great detail everything he experienced on the “other side”. He recorded all his experiences in this book and also the insights and understanding he gained from these experiences about life, death, the afterlife, our connection to other souls and to the Divine Spirit, the purpose of life and what is the true underlying force that drives the universe, always has and always will.<br /><br />Dr. Eben’s experiences were so amazing that they were almost beyond words. He experienced visions, sounds, met kindred souls and guardian angels and received profound messages. His accounts are very significant because they come from a scientist, an ex-sceptic with a highly analytical mind who under extreme and rare circumstances was taken on a miraculous journey beyond the mind, beyond time and beyond space and yet he was allowed to come back to tell the world about it in a very methodical clear and concise fashion. He also adds his very clear and inspiring conclusions with an unmistakable air of conviction and confidence.<br /><br />In summary: Proof of Heaven is a truly revolutionary book. I wholeheartedly recommend this amazing book. It may totally change the way you look at life and serve as a great source of inspiration and comfort.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|awesome game I cant wait for the next levels.it really was a very interesting and intriguing game. love the hints also
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game. it is so much fun to play. I play it all the time. Totally awesome!!!<br />I love that I can give them costumes to wear during the game.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|I learned a great deal about the country.  It was just a great book.  I could not put it down.
B0091THDOM|5.0|The quality of the product is amazing. fits and protect the phone and it is very elegant. Definitely I recommend.
B0061P2L5U|5.0|The level of depth the author goes in to in this book is incredible. The author covers many angles, and has managed to write of of the most well sourced books I have read in a long time.<br /><br />If you really want to learn more than you probably should on this subject, this is the book for you.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|The game is very addictive. I just want to play the game every chance I get,my wife and I both love candy crush and play it  for hours.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I'm watching the move! Awesome!!! I don't get the cameras and trackers though. Happy Hunger Games, and may the odds be ever in your favor!
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|I don't see why people like this. It's so dumb! It moves so slowly and you only get so many moves to complete the level so you never know when you will win. DON'T GET THIS IT SUCKS MY NONEXISTENT BALLS!#!!!!
B00E9E4EC8|5.0|This album is so beautiful. Alan Jackson has such a rich voice, and the material is just wonderful. I think other bluegrass lovers with enjoy this album as much as I.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Amusing so far. Keeps you going for more. No boring rooms. Very well designed. Always looking for more. Kudos to the design team. ;)
B007QXWV1U|4.0|One of my personal favorites. I use many different photo editor and collage apps and this one has brought a new and exciting change to the pictures I create. It will definitely get the job done!
B00G32OER4|4.0|Okay well, first off I guess the best part is, Umm the best part is definitely you get to see Lilly Taylor be possessed, the worst part is you have to see Lilly Taylor after she's had some plastic surgery. It is fun to watch this film set in the mid 1960s done subtly believably well; the acting is good the storyline proves to be strong the movie, for a horror film, you really couldn't find a better one out there at this time.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|George R. R. Martin is a brilliant author. This is the perfect kind of book to lose yourself in this world he has created. I haven't felt this passionate for a book series in years. Even if you've already seen the show on tv , reading this will fill in so many cracks you don't even realize you're missing.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|best game to keep u busy and its loads of fun<br />too much fun in fact<br />my kids love it too I recommend it to everyone

B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I can play this game for his and if my kids become restless, they play it. Game does freeze and that is the only reason I couldn't give it 5 stars. Kindle Fire.
0761172726|5.0|Every year in late summer/early fall I get this calendar.  Each new school year starts a new calendar.  It is perfect for our family.  I love the sense of humor on each page.  The included stickers makes keep track of our various events fun.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Ok guys, spoilers ahead.<br />We all know that Tris dies and this is not good, but the character development of her choices and why she chooses to sacrifice herself is incredibly good.<br /><br />I mean come on, Divergent was and extraordinarily amazing creation.<br />Insurgent a little less, but still above all of those YA books out there.<br />Then we have Allegiant, which was fairly good, your typical YA book. I am under the belief that the idea burned most brightly in the beginning and at the very, very end.<br /><br />Seeing the world from Tobias’s point of view was different but good. At times, I agreed with a lot of people and said wait where’s the difference between these 2 voices. At other times it was startlingly clear that this was Tris or this was Tobias.<br /><br />In Insurgent, Tris continually “sacrifices” herself without good reason, to get away from the grief and guilt that surrounds her. She is trying, and failing, to imitate her parents and their love and selflessness. But she doesn’t really understands what that means until she goes into the death serum room in place of Caleb. It is not out of wanting to get out of life, this time, indeed she has decided that she rather likes life and would prefer not to leave it. So when she takes Caleb’s place it is purely love that drives her forward and when her mother comes, she is ready. She knows she has mane her mark on the world and she also knows it is finally time to give in.<br /><br />This coupled with Tobias’s narration of the epilogue, is what makes this a deeply profound and amazing trilogy. The beginning was awesome and the end was deeply thought provoking and therefor I commend Veronica Roth on her books and defend Allegiant against all of you who haven’t yet gotten the deeper meaning.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|It's an in-depth read about how the world started in the beginning of the Zombie war and the after effects of winning. To be able to see how the responded from the US, the French, Japanese, the Africans, and even the Cubans, but many more as well. This book is a great account of how the Zombie war occurred.

B00FRMDH7Y|5.0|A well put together movie of both comedy and pure imagination. A must see for all the family/children. I liked it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is the best book in history because of the theme and the drama and the romance. My favourite part of the book is when katniss and peeta find each other and they fall in love
B00EGMQIJ0|5.0|It is a chilling story of the near future that is fictional but not by much. We are almost there today
B00G9U7NEQ|5.0|Excellent movie, you will not regret renting or buying this film!!! Great for all ages! Hope this helps you make your decision.
B000FC2L1E|5.0|I listened to the entire Outlander series audiobooks. Reading them is even more enjoyable and I realize how much I missed with the audiobooks. Every book in the series is packed with adventures.  Though these books have many pages they are definitely not long. I have trouble putting them down<br />I
B00B0X4PIO|4.0|I love this authors previous books, this one is also terrific, definitely worth a read!! Ones imagination is tested, positively!
B006DJ2JSI|4.0|It's quick and relatively easy. The only thing I don't like is when I hit the back arrow it takes me to my own home screen rather than the last page of the app.
B008KYOCA2|5.0|This is one of the best apps I've come across in the lousy kindle app store. I highly recommend this app to anyone who wants to be productive. Five stars for me!

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I really like this game.  I get stuck a lot on many levels, but what's the point of a game if it's not fun and challenging? :)
B00992CF6W|3.0|Minecraft is my favorite but every time I try to type on a sign it shuts down my kindle fire HD for 10 or so minutes and I paid $7.00 for it what should I do?!?!?
B0064BWDRW|5.0|Another fabulous Harry Hole story!! I just hope Nesbo keeps these great novels coming....because I am sooo hooked!! A must for all serious Harry Hole fans out there!! Great stuff....Again!!!
006202406X|1.0|I loved the first two books. I read them each three times. Sometimes I would finish them and turn right back around and read them again!<br /><br />With that being said, I am extremely disappointed by this book. Like the other reviews, I was not left hopeful. After finishing the book I wish I could take it back! The story is forever ruined, and as I read in a review, I'm pretty sure Ms. Roth just ruined her career and her chances at making the series into movies. I really wish I hadn't read this book.<br /><br />If you want to read it, don't buy it. Just wait to check it out from a library so you don't regret spending the money on it.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This is the first place in July<br /><br />And this is a regular season of the first place in the first place in July of this is the black unnecessary to a few days ago in I
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is a fun game. I hope somewhere there is one for young children. The graphic are very nice to see.
006202406X|2.0|Ive read hundreds of books and I remember how excited I was to recommend this series to my family,&lt; my reading buddies>. My routine after Ive waited a year for a series book, is to re-read the first ones so my mind is refreshed on the story, but with this series I didnt feel it was necessary because I loved it so much that the names Four and Tris brought the whole story back for me.<br />After I started reading Allegiant, I remembered everything and thought it started out great, but then IM like.......why was I so in love with this story? What happened to the great love story those two shared and I dont recall Four being so weak and cry babyish.<br />By the middle of the book I felt like smacking Tris and telling her to get over herself! Im still sorta in shock over this book and so disappointed. A lot of it was just plain boring so my speed reading kicked in.<br />I'll still be a fan of Miss Roth, thinking she will listen to her readers and learn from all this, as she is still very young and Im sure a head full of stories to write.<br />As for this series, read the first two books and then make up your own last book.
B005XR3K5M|5.0|Legend of Zelda playing cards, what more can you ask for?! The cards are awesome and the artwork is cool. Official Nintendo product which is what you want to be looking for when buying collectibles like this. Great overall! if you are a Legend of Zelda fan and are interested in collecting Legend of Zelda things, then I highly recommend buying this!
B003G4W49C|5.0|Now that this book is being made into a movie, more people will have a chance to enjoy the story.  Well written and multilayered.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|The Chromecast player is unable to maintain a continuous connection despite the recommended tweaks to my router.  I even relocated my wireless router to provide a stronger signal.  As a result, each time I want to use it to connect to Netflix or YouTube (the only options), I have to go through the setup procedure.  Modest cost, $35.00.  The aggravation is not worth it.  For a few bucks more you can buy a DVD that does the same thing, only more reliably.
B002QE3CTY|4.0|This book came highly recommended by my 14 year old niece. As she is the one who introduced me to Hunger Games, I decided to give it a try. This sci-fi is an enjoyable read - I found it just a tad slow at first, but it picked up and grew on me. I would call it YA but the author is not afraid to kill off characters.
0143034901|1.0|If a book is a mirror, that must mean I'm florid, redundant, convoluted, and agonizingly boring.<br /><br />This was a gift from a loved one. Read it to discuss with him. Four days I'll never get back. Should've put it down when I guessed the first 'mystery,' definitely when the second was revealed and I'd thought it was a glaringly obvious assumption from the start.<br /><br />Maybe this is a genre with which I'm unfamiliar. Melodramatic, predictable, repetitive yammer. The characters all had the same voice. The women weren't even characters, just cut-outs. The only interesting character became boring the instant the narrator started drooling on her, and she was reduced to another flat receptacle.<br /><br />Plus the book is hideously typeset, almost too ugly to bear. Yet I slogged through for my friend, and since I know he won't want to hear what I actually think, I'm telling the internet.<br /><br />Formulaic bestsellers are the opium of the people.
B00BFUUMO8|3.0|Whenever I open this game it says it needs 0.87 Mb every time! When the bar for the Mb is all the way to the end,  IT TAKES ME TO MY HOME SCREEN! It worked before like a month ago but then it did this and I deleted it. Then I redownloaded it... IT DIDN'T WORK! PLEASE FIX THIS!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|a good,  fun,  game. crush<br />that candy, level up level up, go, go, go, clear the jelly, bring down the fruit
B008M721MS|4.0|Well, it has been working for a while and then it stopped working today and  preinstalled it and it won't work any more.
B00AA7V2Z0|5.0|Show is amazing, but be warned it starts out extremely weird.  If you can get through the first 3 episodes you'll be shocked at how engrossing and entertaining this amazingly written series is.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|My friends all told me but I did'nt believe them. This game is truly addictive but So much fun. It would be nice if they change the music occasionally.
B000QCS8TW|4.0|Tremendous writing. Phenomenal start to the beginning of a saga that will be known as one of the greatest of all time.
B00FWB6ZBA|5.0|Former Genesis member, Steve Hackett continues the true Genesis spirit playing the true Genesis songs with talent and perfection, unlike the trio that ruined it all unlike in the Genesis  [[ASIN:B000XPU5NY Live Over Europe]] cd
1594202273|3.0|Interesting, but so complicated that keeping the players straight was difficult.  One must take the author at his word for too much without background info.
B005GQ5HB0|5.0|What starts off as the story of an intense love affair, turns into a meditation on the collective guilt over the holocaust and the need for retribution and atonement.  The novel straddles the period in German history between the late 1950s, when people were desperate to forget about the Nazi regime, and the mid 1960s - 1970s, when the younger generation were looking back and (righteously) demanding accountability from those who participated in any way with the holocaust.  This change in social conscience is highlighted by Michael, whose intellectual desire to understand the holocaust interacts with his deep emotional feelings for the perpetrator of an atrocity.
B00DYOOGYK|5.0|Is a good game but the mission are hard and who can complete the game without hacking it but without hacking is good.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Really fun. Searching for items can be difficult buts that is why I like it.  The tricks are to keep searching even it it is weird.
B004XZR63M|5.0|Mind set change !!! People are defined by their profession so they work is hard to obtain the highest level of achievement for not only the sense of entitlement also for the financial reward .. But when there's a greater title there's a greater image hence the beginning of the rat race ... This book Is by far the best one in my collection today
B000FCKRDI|5.0|This is one of my go-to books. It helps to read the preceding books in the series to establish the character's of the main couple and to understand the back stories . With that being this is the best of the lot.  Watching the unlikely couple develop during the course of this story never seems contrived or over written. It is a refreshing and easy read.
B004RCUJ9E|5.0|Its checkers with easy to understand menus. Its very hard to mess up checkers and the developers did a wonderful job.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|The series has yet to disappoint and keeps you on the edge of your seat, biting your lip. The acting is superb and you really connect with the characters.
B00EAIMGDW|1.0|I have a Tegra 3 phone and man does this game heat it up...<br /><br />Simple game where you move a thief by touching the screen. Has fluid and \\"cute\\" animations but that's about it.<br /><br />As for the puzzles, well they're not actual puzzles. The puzzles are simplified to the point where all you're doing is clicking on the screen when it tells you to.<br /><br />Was able to play the game for ten minutes before it lost its appeal. Not very good at keeping one's attention...
B00BW6SOIQ|3.0|i dont think the story was fully developed about the james spader charactor. expected more. the actors did a good job with the material they had.
B008469DGY|5.0|My favorite app when I need to waste 5-10 minutes.<br /><br />You swipe the screen to hit the ball, change the ball's trajectory, and alter the ball's movement when rolling on the green. You get points based on how often you swiped the screen and how close you got to the hole or if you make the shot.<br /><br />No putting in this game, you just hit the ball off the tee and try to get a hole-in-one.
B005H0CBZ0|5.0|After starting the series again, a few years after reading them for the first time, I am so happy to find that I enjoyed each book so far even more than when originally read!
B00BMNM4H6|5.0|Simple and yet complicated game. Sugar crystals fall and you direct them into a coffee mug by drawing lines on the screen. Sometimes you have to process the crystals through color changing &#34;filters&#34; and direct those crystals to the coffee mug with the same color.
B007WEQ3K8|1.0|This looks like it was slapped together in a few hours. Lots of clip art. Don't bother with this, there are better games out there
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|this game is sooo addictive! i cannot believe i spend so much time on it. i think of it when i go to bed and first thing in the morning as well. only gripe is that since i updated the app on my s4 i am no longer getting gifted lives from friends like i was before. maybe 1 or 2 a day where as i would get 10 or more daily before update. however i send lives and boosters repeatedly. this seems unfair. one good thing is i am only playing for a couple of minutes now instead of hours because i fail the level i am at within a few seconds. i hope they fix this or im gonna uninstall. it was great before update.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|A good read with an incredible story line.  I could not put this book down.  The author brought these characters to life.
B002BWCJOA|5.0|This is a great movie that my kids absolutely love. The animation, acting / voice overs are great. Watch it.
B004MC8CA2|3.0|This is a very good way to read the bible technical. Also a good price for such a powerful word.<br />Nice
B00499NHLC|5.0|Story was intriguing,well written; acting was excellent. This version is the best portrayal of Sherlock Holmes that I have seen!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|crazy fun and addictive.  I play this game on my pc and the mobile vers8ion is just as good at the pc version.
B00E8G5HDW|5.0|My son loves this series, very disappointed that Disney is not continuing this (so far) and hoping they get it together and come out with some new ones.  This is a great series for Star Wars fans who are newer and they had a good message too.  Frees up my DVR of what he recorded too!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|yay for finally joining the kindleverse ... was too long coming and a welcome addition to my app list. now I'm off to clear all the jelly!
B00F3W9NQ2|5.0|I thought it was an excellent start to the season.  I cant not wait to see the entire season soon
B009UX2YAC|5.0|love it. I absolutely love it. the only thing about this game is that you have to buy keys or very rarely collect them while playing
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This crazy little game is so challenging it makes it addictive. You have to make the next level so you keep at it until you do. You can see your fellow players and how well they are doing, and that only makes you more determined to achieve the goal. I love it and it is hard to put down.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|So I liked this series despite the whole young love thing it had going.  Despite the characters being really stupid at some times.<br /><br />I have to agree with three others who say there wasn't much differentiation between Tris and Four's voices in narration.<br /><br />But this ending.  I am upset by it.  It was a decent ending I suppose.  Things were brought to a close in a satisfactory and believable manner.  But it left me...in a state of just...ugh.  Like...that was it?<br /><br />SPOILERS!!!! SPOILERS!!!! SPOILERS!!!!<br /><br />But the fact that Tris fought her way through the death serum...but then gave up and went with her mother to die.  It just made me angry.  Yes I can see her going in her brother's place.  She lives to be the martyr.  But then she always fights tooth and nail to live.<br /><br />Not to mention the whole dead girlfriend trope.  I was pleased to see a strong female protagonist. She wasn't perfect but she was real.  Then in the end she is sacrificed....for what?  Plot twists?  Shock value?  Because life isn't fair?<br /><br />It just makes me really mad for some reason...and not just oh-I'm-so-mad-this-didn't-end-the-way-I-wanted or WTF-you-can't-kill-the-main-character mad...but it just seemed like...IDK I how to give Tris a happy ending so let's kill her off so it's not too cheesy.
1401917232|5.0|This is the third book of Gary's trilogy about 'forgiveness practice' as taught from the pages of A Course in Miracles.  It contained more encouraging examples of where and how to apply 'forgiveness practice'.  It has been so helpful in focusing and distilling the central teaching of ACIM in my mind.  I read it feverishly and now intend to go through it with a fine tooth comb to get every ounce of encouragement and focused teaching I can.  Thank you Holy Spirit/Gary/Pursah/Arten...it is an answer to 'it has to be really easy in order for me to get it'.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game but my minecraft won't update. I still give it five stars though. I would<br />recommend this game to those who love to build giant pieces of crap.
B00AEBBA72|5.0|Extremely well-done movie with an excellent cast.  The scenery really sets the mood for the story. Fun to watch, especially around Halloween.
B00F87ZUYG|4.0|I really do like this series and I did come to it a bit late. I should probably take a peak at season one and two! We do not subscribe to cable and it is nice just to pick up the episodes from Amazon after they run on AMC.
B006S08RLU|5.0|I always return to this movie if I have had a crap day.  Chanting soundtrack, one of a kind take on a lonely girl who makes her own adventure.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|A mind stretcher. It keeps you guessing and is worth the play. Good graphics too. Every room is different and full of surprises.
859037985X|5.0|I have found this book to be very well written. I am new to Lua, and was looking for a good reference - this book provides the foundations that I needed. Roberto's writing is great - the style makes the subject matter very accessible and easy to understand.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The book was awesome!!  I've read it twice and cried at the end both times!!  If you liked the other books, you'll love this one!
B00C5R7F8G|4.0|Well as the cliche goes, this book is a page turner. Having studied a bit about nuclear weapons in graduate school for chemical physics, I was familiar with their technology. but Schlosser does a great job of scaring the living daylights out of you with his details about how poorly designed the safety features on weapons really are.<br /><br />He skips around alot in the book. It's a bit disorienting to read in one chapter about the personal lives of the men involved in the incident at Damascus, then in the next chapter be taken back 20 years for a detailed discussion of nuclear weapons policy and history. But his historical and political analysis of the culture of nuclear and thermonuclear weapons is spot on.<br /><br />We got lucky, there's no other way to put it. Darn lucky. I was fairly complacent about the safety features on weapons until I read this book. It will change the way you view them if you, like I, bought into the story that those who handle and manage these weapons have a system that works because it's well designed.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I don't read a lot.... I know... what am I doing here right??  But I absolutely LOVED the Trilogy of the Hunger Games!  I've read all three books twice and am in love with Suzanne Collins' characters, the action, the relationships...... it's GREAT!!
B000FCJZUO|4.0|This is a wonderful story told in a unique way. I have read it twice now and it still surprises me with things I didn't notice before. Cecelia Ahern is a wonderful author and I look forward to reading more of her books!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I read this after seeing the movie and it was great!  It filled in a few things the movie left out and set me up perfectly for the rest of the trilogy.  At this point I've read all three books twice and have recommended them to all my friends.  I love Suzanne Collins style, her characters, their relationships and the political struggles of PanEm.
B00BG4RLF6|4.0|Some of the songs are a bit too minimalist for me, but Overgrown and Retrograde are so outstanding, they make up for it, at least for me.
B004MC8CA2|3.0|When I go to add a Note, it lets me add it, but it doesn't let me look at it after I add it. Please help me with this problem. Thanks...<br />RaShawn Harris
B0040HO01Y|5.0|Wonderful show! Beautifully written. Funny, sensitive, well-rounded characters. Fantastic cinematography. If you like end of the 19th century British series, you'll love Larkrise to Candleford.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Good book and great series.  I did not care for it as much as I did the first 2 books in the series.  I thought it was too much of the same thing.
B004I8WD6E|5.0|Great little phone case at an excellent cost.  It's a little difficult to bend to get it over the phone, but once applied, it stays in place. I have gotten several questions on where I got the study little case.
B00B52F278|5.0|I purchased this as a birthday gift.  The birthday boy loved it so much, he was very disappointed when the series ended.  Lots of action and definitely not for children (lots of sex, blood and violence).  The people he watched it with loved it also.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|A very touching, heartfelt story.  Moyes does a beautiful job of telling this poignant story of loss, love and life.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great Book and great series.j  It kept my interest throughout the entire book and I really got into it.  I can't wait for the movie to come out.
B00E3BK0QQ|4.0|This was the first G5 game I played. It was fun. A lot of mini games and interesting story line. I will definitely play more of these games.
B008XK69S6|5.0|The n7 music player is really nice because it searches all yours music files and finds songs and videos. It's really easy to work with and its free
B00BM1AJIO|5.0|I really love this game. Beautiful graphics and interesting story line. Also nice twist on hidden objects games. I think it's worth the price.
B00F91RYL8|5.0|This Movie was a very happy surprise. I initially watched it to see how Brad Pitt would look on film with a bunch of zombies. I was pleasantly surprised when this movie was NOT what I thought it was going to be. It was thoughtful, intelligent, and heart wrenching- yet warming. Not many zombie movies can saw they were seen to the public as being thoughtful, or intelligent or heart wrenching or warming. I loved the involvement of the scientists at WHO. (I'm a scientist so maybe I am partial) but this is the BEST ZOMBIE APOCALYPSE MOVIE I've ever seen.  It's 'the thinking man's Zombie Apocalypse movie.
B006LSZECO|5.0|The book was well written and hard to put down. There was a gradual revealing of the truth from 2 different characters at different periods in the story line which eventually came together and the surprising truth was revealed.
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|I read this book two weeks ago and it still impacts me on daily basis.  It is very thought provoking.
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|Neat little game. Keeps me entertained. Works great on my Motorola Droid Max. No issues what so ever. I recommend it.
B00GD9F59S|5.0|Now this is my review from my blog which you can visit at elizabethmmansfield.blogspot.com<br /><br />Sentinel by Jennifer Armentrout Review<br />How many times do I have to tell you guys that Jennifer Armentrout is the most talented author out there?!?!? Cause really she is. I own at least 16 of her books and have loved every. single. one.<br />Now Sentinel the last very last book in her Covenant series came out today. I already finished it. I cried the last 10% of the book and afterwards. I couldn't stop crying. Anyone else who finished it said they cried too...it. was. beautiful. I don't know how I can even give the credit this book and author deserves. It was amazing and I can't stop saying how amazing it was and how much I loved it...<br /><br />The book starts off right where the last one ended and Alex the main character is broken a bit from her encounter with Ares and she realizes something is wrong but can't figure it out and you keep trying to figure out what's going on and you guess and hope and then BAM! and then you're like Oh that makes sooo much sense as to why Alex was acting how she was but the story continues on and there is so much action and did I mention this series is Paranormal Romance?!?!?...nope hehe oops okay well it is...sometimes heavy on the romance but can you blame the author when you have a character like Aiden (who I'll get to soon enough)...anyways action..yeah that..all the action in the story is great...there are so many unexpected things that happen and you're like WHAT!?! HOW!!okay okay breathe...and you can't help but love everything that happens<br /><br />Now Seth...he is a character that I hated for the most part except on the occasion when he was sarcastic..I really love sarcasm btw...my family doesn't understand though..anyways...but nonetheless I didn't like him throughout the series but in this book..he seriously redeemed himself and I actually love him and I seriously hated him..but it's all good now!!:)<br /><br /> Okay now Aiden...Aiden was my first book boyfriend and is still my one true love even though he's Alex's. Alex and Aiden are so darn cute I love them and they have loved each other from the first book and ahhh so cute and Aiden is soooo totally swoon worthy and hot and really sexy but so sweet and caring and overprotective (as always) of Alex in the book. I love everything about those two and in the end I was bawling my head off because something bad does happen and I'm like when people die they stay dead..well at least the second time around if you've read the other books hehehe...<br /><br />...So yeah, in the end things worked out in totally seriously unexpected way. The ending was perfect. so freaking perfect especially for this series and I really want a spin off because no one I mean on one can ever have enough of Alex and Aiden. Again everything was perfect and beautiful and this series is the only series where I have ever cried during more than one of the books..it's more like all of them because they are just that awesome...and I don't really ever cry in books(I think maybe four series including this one) so if you hear me say I cried..it was good. I really hate that this series ended because it is and will always be my favorite but I loved how it end...but seriously I want more Alex and Aiden and oh Aiden's brother Deacon is really funny (I forgot to mention that...)<br /><br />Now I am seriously begging you-go read this whole series and every single book by Jennifer Armentrout. She is awesome and talented and amazing and I need more words to describe how much I really love her and her books. I don't care if you don't want to spend money on books...just do it cause it is soooo worth it in the end...<br /><br />I rate this book 10/10 but it deserves so much more and go but this book, this series, and all other books by Jennifer Armentrout..cause this series has been optioned for a tv show and another of her series (The Lux series) is going to be a movie..she'sthat awesome...now go and enjoy and happy readings to all!!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|One of the most captivating games I've ever played. Forces you to bend your mind to solve great puzzles. You're then rewarded with something opening, turning, unfolding, etc. Took me a little while to gather the gist of how this works as I've only ever played about 10 scenes in one of those &amp;#34;room&amp;#34; puzzles. Like the other, my only disappointment is that it's too short! Am looking forward to more of these games. Please hurry!!!
B009E3EWPI|5.0|love it.  really needed this,  best band ever, needed to hear some fresh zep.  thanks for shipping so fast.  live comcert video was awesome, especially seeing the emotional Jason Bonham.  He sounded just like his father
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|I saw the series on TV and decided to have it as part of my DVD-collection, as I will watch it again and show to friends.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|The the best part is that it is actually realistic.<br /><br />Worst part is its too addictive! A serious chain smoker of 40 year  could quit a million times before I would put this Down!!!!!<br /><br />I love this game! I REFUSE TO RATE ANY AND GAMES BUT THIS ONE I ACCEPTED IT!!<br />I swear on my life, I almost lost my girlfriend 10 times it's that addictive! The only reason I put this down was because she is my whole world. If I didn't have her, I would be in a living HELL with nothing to live for! She is the best thing in my life and I cannot eat, drink, breath, sleep, sit, stand, or anything without her being the most important thing on my mind.
B003VANOFY|5.0|It is really comfortable, nice sound and good range and it is very customizeable. I love it and would recommend it to anyone thinking about buyign a new headset.
B000FC1MCS|5.0|Very similar to The Perks of Being a Wallflower. Helps one gain insight on many aspects of life - a must-read!
B009NG1Q96|4.0|The elite was a good book and had some twisters in it that really made it better, but I just wish that America would stop being so frustrating!
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|when to see this movie in the theater and i pre ordered this the same day,go get yours today :)
B008MM9630|4.0|I cannot give it a five star because I have problems with my game such as the box doesn't show up an I cannot log into anything to get gems an add friends. Other then that the game is AMAZING
B003VANOFY|5.0|Great clarity i use them for vidio chatting gamening and listening when i have to move around and have company in the house. Logic tech did it again.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I downloaded the app but when I went to use it, it pulled up a notification that said if I wanted to use this app my license agreement would end. It also said amazon would use my app to supply information for them.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is not only a fun game but also teaches you skills that will help you have fast reflexs.
B00EY7LT9Q|3.0|OK, I am a true Marvel fan. Not a &#34;I've read every comic about every character and can tell you their whole backstory and where they fit in the Marvel Universe&#34; sort of fan, just someone who LOVES superheroes (especially Marvel's characters). I watch everything Marvel (and DC) these days -- animated, digital, and live action -- and have since I was a child.<br /><br />I eagerly anticipated this show, if for no other reason than a chance to see Clark Gregg's Agent Phil Coulson again. (Love that character!!) I really wish I could give this show 5 stars, but it feels like it is missing something. It's got the characters and the details, but the stories haven't really gelled to the point of being really interesting ... at least not for me. I will continue to watch, because it is improving as the show continues, but there is an air of campiness to the show that makes it hard to get into. I love seeing Coulson again, but I do hope they 'dig a little deeper' with the storylines so the show will be much more engaging. Not that it is bad, it is just not very interesting ... yet. Or maybe my expectations are too high?
B0001I561E|5.0|Aladdin is one hour and thirty minutes and was released in theaters on November 25, 1992. The movie is about a diamond in the rough who is Aladdin who lives with his pet monkey Abu in the city of Agrabah. Aladdin and Abu steal so they can eat. One day while Aladdin and Abu are eating their breakfast they happen to spot a beautiful lady. Unknown to both of them it is the Princess Jasmine who is disguise as a commoner. Aladdin rescues Princess Jasmine when she is accused of stealing an apple from a merchant. Aladdin is caught and taken to the dungeon and there he meets Jafar in disguise as an old man. The old man takes Aladdin to the Cave of Wonders and tells Aladdin to get his lamp and he will reward him. Aladdin finds the lamp but Abu did nee heed the Cave of Wonders warning and touches a giant red diamond. The cave begins to collapse and the magic carpet rescues Aladdin and Abu and head towards the exit. Once they get to the exit Jafar tries to kill Aladdin, but Abu interferes and saves Aladdin and takes back the lamp from Jafar. Once Aladdin recovers from his fall, he rubs the lamp to read some writing on it and the Genie appears. This is where I end because I don’t want to give away the rest of the movie. Aladdin was Disney’s 31st animated movie and the forth movie in the Disney Renaissance era. Also this was the last movie that Alan Menken and Howard Ashman collaborated on. The movie won two Oscars for Best Music, Original Song and Best Music, Original Score. Also it won a total of five Grammy Awards, four in 1994: Best Instrumental Composition Written for a Motion Picture or for Television, Best Song Written Specifically for a Motion Picture or for Television, Song of the Year, Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals and one in 1995 - Best Musical Album for Children.  Aladdin is a great movie and gets AAAAA+++++.<br /><br />DVD FEATURES<br /><br />Disc 1<br />Play<br />Scene Selection<br />Bonus Features<br />I.

B007PT1PEY|5.0|Very well done . . . looks great even on my original Kindle. I usually 'read myself to sleep', and this eBook replaced a very heavy hardcover printed collection which was very difficult to handle. In eBooks, as with most things, 'you get what you pay for'; glad I made the right choice. (Although not 'free', this eBook still is a lot less expensive than my hardcopy.)
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Such a fun game to play but boy is it frustrating to be stuck on a level for weeks at a time. Love and hate Candy Crush, lol.
B0019IB0II|5.0|So inspiring and confirming. Also explains how the forces of positive and negative can exist in all of us. And how we can choose to be grateful, joyous and compassionate.
B003EY7IRC|5.0|One of my favorite authors, this book reinforces that :)<br /><br />I really good end to this series. I loved it.
B00479SVBU|5.0|Flawed, but it works.<br />What more can you say than it plays music on your USB stick on the car radio!
B00G32QIEG|4.0|If I had watched this alone, I would probably have only given it 3 stars, but my teenaged nephew had suggested it and asked me to watch it with him.  I don't usually go for so much violence and gore, but this was done with some humor. Not something I would have normally chosen , but turned out to be entertaining and fun with the input from a younger person.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Like everyone else I think this is a well-written and well-acted show. It took a few episodes of Season 1 before I was drawn in but now I am hooked.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This is the second time I read the book and again I was amazed at the debt of Orson Scott Cards writing
1451627289|3.0|bought this book for a gift and was very disappointed that it came without out a dust cover and the pages were<br />all yellow...it isn't that old of an book...so couldn't understand why the discoloration.  Without the dust cover, it<br />doesn't look as festive for a gift.  Description said like new...it isn't like new.  But it did arrived quickly.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It's an ok game its fast paced but sometimes it gets boring do the same obstacles over and over again...
B001EC2ISA|4.0|This is a classic! Michael Keaton is hilarious and the movie is so obviously the work of Tim Burton. Anyone who enjoys The Nightmare Before Christmas or the Corpse Bride would enjoy this movie.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I've been waiting months for this game to be available on the kindle. So happy it's finally here. Now just wish I didn't have to wait 30 mins for a life.
B00AW57L96|3.0|bit rambling but I did like the ending, a true pandoras box, glad I did read it though I am not a fan of going from one persons story to anothers
B00992CF6W|3.0|There once was a boy, he bought a game called minecraft. He parents found out and got mad, they took the boys kindle fire away. Then when he got the game back, he played that game everyday, then one day when he was playing his game, it froze.<br /><br />  Was this helpful?  Yes or No!
B008K8VDPU|5.0|PLAYING PIANO IS AWESOME.....WAY TO GO WHOEVER MADE THIS APP. Now i know how to play my favorite songs and enjoy them!
B003G4W49C|4.0|All in all, it was a great book. But in some parts not enough was revealed. I would of gave it 5 stars but some parts left you in a small state of confusion. Other wise a fantastic book.
034580404X|1.0|Let us not rehash how awful this is - got it on a dare with a gift card - highly disappointed on how POORLY WRITTEN it is and how the American voice of the character is just a complete disaster! Why did I buy this crap?! Dang.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|I hated the book I didn't understand it at all it was a confusing book to read it had words and definitions everywhere DO NOT GET THIS BOOK!!!!
B003R4ZMJU|5.0|GUILTY PLEASURE - END OF STORY! Its so addictive - I've watched it since it premiered and read the books as a teenager and in my early 20's. Its cute - if you dig girl drama, coming of age and parents that 'just don't seem to understand' type of scenarios - not to mention the WHODUNIT plot. You might dig the show and books.
B0094M2OPY|5.0|Very good movie my sons favorite, even went trick or treating this year  as Jack the pumkin king, never gets tired of watching it
B001C4AFOY|5.0|Not fully historically accurate but a lush period drama - that has handsome actors all over the screen and some historical context to it.
B002OF5KWM|5.0|When I seen this movie for the first time I was amazed and shocked.  I been to parties when Superstar DJ Keoki spun n been to Limelight The Tunnel Webster Hall and among other NYC clubs.  I DJ myself.......trance music.  I started in 1996.  Before all this happened but talked to other DJs who knew all about it.  When I mentioned it to my NYC DJ friends that been in the scene for along time they remembered it n told me all about it.  I liked the movie.  It shows how the rave scene evolved drugs used which is all true.  Cooking up bottles of Ketamine (Special K)  taking Ecstasy Acid but Heroin and cocaine/crack r not rave drugs.  That's the part I didn't get when Michael got hooked on both.  Ravers didn't do that s*** even today.  But he became an addict so it is what it is.  It's FU he killed his drug dealer and how and only got 10-20years in 1998.  As far as I know he is still locked up.  15yrs he has done n will be out in 5yrs no matter what.  But he did his time but kept getting in trouble in jail so he never made parole.  I'm still a DJ today but I'm also a fan of EDM and will be a raver for life.  The scene has changed since 1996.  Just the people who go n it's getting more mainstream......like DJs like David Guetta Calvin Harris even Tiesto who was a huge influence on me back in the day when he spun trance......now he is a sellout progressive house DJ.  Dubstep has been around before Skrillex n I don't like it.  Jungle is awesome.....Some house music there are so many kinds.  Anyway........all in all I gave it 5 stars cause of my background n know what it's like this whole culture.......buy the movie the book even they made a documentary on Michael Alig on A&E.  WATCH IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0767819659|5.0|I was 10 when this came out and was so excited in 1998. Its still an adorable movie - no spoilers its a mash up of the 1st Madeline books and several others Ludwig B. created.
B007WEQ3K8|4.0|Really does help, it challenges your mind pushing it to retain and work more. Can't get that from any mere crossword puzzle.
B00DQAM5LI|5.0|Best metal CD ever!  Was just introduced to Avenged Sevenfold on my local rock radtio station -- OMG, wish I'd discovered them earlier, they rock.  M. Shadows has the best metal scream.
B00E9P957Q|5.0|I listened to the whole set as soon as I took delivery of it and every album just blew my mind!
B00DGGIXS6|5.0|Way to go Cher, you've still got it baby!  Her vocal training has made her voice stronger than ever.  Song that Pink gave her (tune in to find out which track) is a stand out.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have been waiting for candy crush to available on kindle...I was really happy<br />When I saw it...thank you guys...
1401223176|5.0|The story is great and should be easily understandable to those not very familiar with DC comics up to 2002. However, if you prefer very dark and gritty Batman stories (The Long Halloween, Year One), then you should know that this GN isn't really one of those. It still has some dark scenes, especially in the flashbacks to Bruce's past, but the overall tone is somewhat lighter than usual and the art has much less dark and shadows.<br /><br />The art is just amazing, every single page is a real masterpiece. Even more than the art, I loved the colors - they're absolutely beautiful. I have both a print trade paperback of this graphic novel and a digital HC, so if you haven't read this awesome story yet, I definitely recommend reading it in digital form. There a a lot of double-page spreads that look much better on a screen than in a print book, and the glow of a PC screen make all the lights in the panels come really alive.<br /><br />Very definitely a must read.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Wonderful characters who grow and change along with a compelling plot and unique information. Believable story as well as being a page turner from start to finish. Bonus--figuring out the meaning of the title. This will provide a whole new dimension to the novel.
B00499NHLC|5.0|A great modern spin on Sherlock. The talent is amazing I cant wait for season four to come out. Love it!
B009LMTDL0|5.0|I am impressed how well Sheryl identifies with strong career minded women.  Thank you for stating it so eloquently.  I have new person on my bucket list I want to have lunch with and share ideas.
1250007208|5.0|A MUST , A MUST, A MUST READ! LOVE Cinder, Iko, and the Prince! All the characters were awesome! I will continue with the trilogy!
B006IGZWB2|5.0|Telling it like it was, and unfortunately, still is, just more underhanded.<br />great acting, perfect example of those times and places.
B00FXEL00W|5.0|It's so nice to read a well- written, humourous and sensitive story about a subject that can be quite heavy. The author captured the struggle with one's sexuality perfectly without becoming mired down. I really enjoyed this book, the story was well developed, the dialogue was done very well, especially the inner monologues of the characters. I hope to read more from Kristen Zimmer in the near future!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Mahalo for making this available for the Kindle Fire! Love this game!!! So addictive. The sound effects are terrific as are the colors.
B00EL6AAEU|5.0|Blackfish reveals the horrors for the majestic killer whale which  are held in captivity for human entertainment. It is heartbreaking but you must watch it to understand what is being done and how wrong it truly is.<br />Sea World is not the place they lead you to believe where the mammals are well cared for and happy while they study/research their behaviors for the betterment of a species....it is a sick,  twisted torture chamber where live creatures are \\"plucked\\" out of their environments from their pods/families and put in beyond small tanks with other unknown whales and forced to train and learn \\"tricks\\" that are not natural  so crowds can pay big bucks to \\"ooh\\"  and \\"aah\\".<br />I will never step foot in another marine Park after seeing the devastating effects on these beautiful giants... You must see it,  if you don't then you are going through life misinformed and \\"feeding\\"  in to the whole myth Sea World has worked hard for people to see while hiding the ungodly truth.
B00BSBR9N6|5.0|This book has a predictable plot, but that doesn't matter because it is such great fun to read. A fast paced, entertaining page turner.
B003XF1OJK|5.0|It was a great book that was hard to put down. Definitely worth reading. Would recommend it to people who like sci-fi
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am sooooooo happy that this was finally available on Kindle Fire HD. I would recommend others to download as well.
B00407PNWO|5.0|Love this movie! One of my favorite Errol Flynn movies. My daughters watched it and thought it was funny and great.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I like how you have to keep looking for the better play. The whole family plays and competes its so much fun.
B0025WX2YW|5.0|Riveting with great drama, lush sets, and at least some historic reality.  Heads will roll when you watch.  Be careful who you marry.
B009JZSC9S|4.0|Season 4 was ok, but lost some of the intrigue of previous seasons.  Not really fond of Dianne Lockhart's character.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|U need to get this game if u like Jaws because it is really awesome u get to upgrade ur shark and eat PEOPLE
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Easy to set-up, great options, versatile. Great for home or on the road. I love the sleep options and clocks.
B005K17RU0|5.0|view of hourly and extended forecasts. beside each other makes this my go to weather app.  other maps and data are also available for multiple locations
B007QJBJ76|4.0|If you think gore = horror, this isn't for you.  Good cast, story and special effects.  Genuinely scary story and an excellent cameo by John Houseman.
B00FXRTWQ8|5.0|This game, and its non-spooky counteract, are highly addicting! It combines a bejeweled-like game with the fun of setting up a fishtank.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|It is a really good game. I think it is better than temple run. It is really fun and you keep on wanting to play it again. I HIGHLY recommend it.
B00FMFEA68|5.0|I'm glad I've read it, though the narrative in the end is indeed sad, but what would you expect? Btw, this is the great chance to catch up with all the songs heard by Morrissey and poems admired by him and movies old and funny as now they are filled with his life.<br />I don't think the book is boring or too long or too raw. It's just Morrissey being himself, and I thank him for that.
B00D8HNR2K|5.0|Best album since the Fragile! Restored my faith in the band. Not that I had lost it, but it needed some dusting off.
B0071NOU78|5.0|My kid LOVES it! It made his Halloween costume perfect. Also was a perfect safety light for trick or treating.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game been playing on computer but couldn't take it with me now it's mobile. Very addictive and challenging
0399213015|2.0|Too small.  Not much of a story but may be okay for beginning reading.  Over too soon.  Would not recommend.
B00004YZFR|5.0|Saw this video many years ago and it definitely left an impression.  It depicts a different side of a Stones' concert.  Shows a dark side of Stones' history.
1612680011|5.0|Excellent book. Great to read along side think and grow rich. Has really opened my mind to the reality of corporate America and why it is essential to invest in assets. I will buy my first investment property in 2014.
B0002E5O9G|5.0|It's like seeing Les Mis all over again!  Made the right choice in picking this version.  Perfect ensemble; great sound.
B0084ANCBC|3.0|Suffers the fate of many &#34;great books&#34;.  Dated style, etc.  Probably an early version of a genre/precursor to a lot of modern novels, but formal language distances reader and pacing very slow for today.  May be best read as an academic project tomlearn more about the history of literature.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|I love this show!!! Excellent storyline--did not think I'd enjoy it after breaking bad. Thanks for having it available to me
B0091XICM0|4.0|I asked my 5 year old grandson if he wanted to watch this movie and he said, &#34;NO! It looks boring.&#34; I turned it on anyway and told him, &#34;Just give it five minutes and if you don't like it we can turn it off.&#34;<br /><br />The beginning was a little slow but he was soon hooked. He watched it all the way through and enjoyed it very much. Good old classic.
B00AA7V2Z0|5.0|The show was unique and had me guessing the whole way. I'm thinking that I know a plot line then it shifts and throws me for a loop. It was scary enough to to actually believe that ghosts walk among us.
B008IGP8RI|5.0|I loved the characters and the story.  Tom Hardy was just wonderful. I  particularly liked the way Hardy would moan and grown in answering anything.  It was a great film....I have watched it several times and am mesmerized by the story.  I loved the movie so much I bough the music cd.  Love that, too.
160774273X|5.0|Information is easy to understand, book pictures are great, directions are complete, and bread is delicious.  What more could you want?
B00E7RZEI0|5.0|Very fun game, challenging at times but it is forgiving.  Never is it so difficult that you want to quit trying for the maximum score.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|Awesome, it just exemplifies the 80's in a nutshell!  It is over the top but very entertaining and cool!  If you were born before 1995 then you will love it and should watch it as a cultural reference!
B005PK553C|3.0|It's an ok story.  To me the plot was a little too far fetched to be entertaining.  Some of the things which occur just  did not make sense.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This sets the bar high for mystery puzzler.  Hints there if you need them.  More rooms please!  More rooms please!  More rooms please!
0316204366|5.0|Galdwell is a master at presenting the multifaceted sides of things we normally take for granted. He tweaks your mind into opening and considering what was and could be a whole different concept. I have read all of his books and he is one of most favorite authors.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Good game! Fun way to relax and its free! Play alone or connect to facebook and play with others! Try it!
B0089LOG02|4.0|I liked the book, &#34;Orphan Train&#34; by Christina Baker Kline.  I enjoyed reading the various facts about the Orphan Train brought into the very interesting story about two people, generations apart and how they helped each other deal with a difficult past while pointing the way to better tomorrows.
B009MYARIK|2.0|I had a hard time liking this story. I hated the characters, didn't care for the narrator's reading and was really irritated by the interfering stupidity of the whole thing. Still I got some chuckles out of it and I did finish it, but would not recommend it to friends.<br />Why did I hate the characters ? The older sister was interfering in her younger sisters marriage, the younger sister was a complete dim witted ditz, one of the men was a stupid  rich boy with little character at all, another was a cold standoffish guy who was basically okay but deserved better, the last guy was a smart man who had issues with being responsible for a lazy arse, basically he baby sat.  None of it worked for me.
B00BHXUC4S|5.0|What a fantastic album. I've been waiting years for this to be remastered and re-released, since the original album was discontinued. Jeff Lynne at his best.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Ender's game was captivating from page one. The mix of moral and philosophical story lines was awesome. I can't wait to read more of the quintet.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|This rating is appropriate to my feeling about the book.While clearly this doctor has a great knowledge of medicine, I felt<br />his time &#34;on the other side&#34; was created post his return...I got the flowery nature of his stay, and the great significance of the<br />angel, but sorry, it just did not feel real to me.  Which he mentioned  is a reaction that he expected from many people.<br />But the writing was well done, particularly while he was &#34;on this side.&#34;
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Playing candy crush saga is a fun way to enjoy candy without<br />Eating it. I enjoy playing this game for hours. I have it on my phone<br />And on my kindle fire hd. This way I can enjoy it twice as much.
B008Y7BE7E|5.0|Humor, horror, happy ending...nearly a perfect zombie movie. Even had partial nudity! Also has plenty of room for spinoffs, series etc.
B00BPDR3F6|4.0|learned a lot! couldn't wait to get home and read this book, didn't want to finish, very interesting historical information along with wonderful character development...
B001IAR13U|5.0|I would actually give Tracy extra starts.  have loved listening to Tracy for years, but after seeing her in concert a couple of years ago, I am can't believe I was even more amazed by her. The emotional and thoughtful lyrics are unique.  I look forward to a chance to see her perform again. For now, I will enjoy this album.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Wow! Nobody builds the courtroom drama and weaves a tale like the master, John Grisham. With an uplifting tale proving it's never too late to make amends or right a past transgression, Mr Grisham has risen the tippy top of my celebrity dinner party guest list! Smart, funny, poignant, tragic....his writing in Sycamore Row shows the author in his prime still.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|This game is so addicting!!! I really enjoy how you can level up really fast and that it is just really fun.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|There are a lot of allegorical elements to Allegiant, much like there were in the final book of Harry Potter. While it is not the ending that many people would have liked, it ended honestly, and very true to life. For the sake of those who have not read it yet, I will not give away anything, but just read it and be open. Be brave.
B00EA8UEZ4|5.0|This book was as entertaining and informative as the previous 2 books. It was well worth the wait.  It drove home for me the absolute importance of practicing forgiveness and inspired me to give it another go.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Enjoyable game, objectives are challenging and the graphics show well. The levels are well thought out and provide a decent rate for the level of advancement within the game.
B00EGMQIJ0|4.0|Eggers takes our attachment to Google, Facebook, et al to the logical conclusion. It's a dystopian vision that's all too probable. The story pulled me along. I'd give it 5 stars if the ending had been a bit more satisfying, but all in all, a very good read.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|Love this series! Moral good, great characters, it's all there! It reminds me of Anne of Greene Gables, set in England. A MUST watch!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Finally! Candy Crush for android-what took ya'll so long to offer this app?<br />I was really disappointed when I got my Kindle Fire and couldn't play
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Must have for every phone much better than the stock kb or any other kb out there and I have tried a bunch of the major ones
B0036S4B6M|5.0|I read it for my book club. It's a very interesting perspective on many life related topics and us prison and justice systems . I love watching the show too. Good read !
B00BGZ8TVA|5.0|Because I love it and it is a great movie to share with friends and family, I highly recommend this movie
B0095ZQ36G|4.0|A wonderful world war 2 yarn. Well researched, interesting, and full of humanity. Days gone by. God bless Franz Stiegler.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Started playing this as a past time, now cannot put it down.  Would have given 5 stars but .99 centing me to death.
B00BN4JQ6G|5.0|Awesome!  The DVD of one of their concerts is incredible.  To have all of their CD's in one set, plus the DVD is totally awesome!
B003F48E4W|1.0|this is a kid's movie.  I can't understand that anyone over 14 thinks this is a great movie!  Even the main characters are kids
B00CWY76CC|5.0|THIS GAME twisted my mind a lot it's not only puzzles but it's the order the puzzles<br />Go in, I beat all the levels, it took a lot of effort and patience but I finally manages to complete them.<br /><br />  Good luck,<br />  Annie
B0002NRQTS|5.0|Classic Rush album gave triumphant music. A truly brilliant album. A must have for any Rush fan. Good for the soul.
B0096HIEE2|2.0|Didn't like it.  Just a bunch of unnecessary nakedness and gyrating. Not a very good storyline. Well, it is a movie about stripping.
B00D29CBIU|5.0|I love it. Resonates with me personally and as an entrepreneur. And I like the humor -  ease of Margaret Lynch's approach. And I must say getting some amazing results with these tapping's in a very short period of time. Who Knew?<br />The exercises hit deep within - if you are really willing to look, what comes up is very powerful and the old beliefs begin to break down. I feel I have re-activated my energy, tapping down the 'blocks' that were in my way - and some for a very long time - and now the doors are opening - welcoming in some real goodness!<br />Amazed and grateful.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Great show very smart and well written. Funny and very honest show that a feel good go luckey show not like most shows that are on tv now
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|I have enjoyed Quell and Quell Reflect a lot. I have waited a couple of months for Quell Memento (it wouldn't download right to my Kindle Fire). But it is here and it is worth the wait!
B00CW6DAKC|4.0|Amazing game but wish the crops were less expensive that way can make  money faster but still love it add me plz FAUEDCI
B006O5YHUY|5.0|This was by far the BEST movie of this genre! ... I liked it more than &#34;Fighter&#34; and even &#34;Rocky&#34;! The acting was just phenomenal, and the fight scenes were so intense and realistic! I was jumping off of the sofa yelling at the t.v. screen! The story was very moving and real. I admit that it made me cry, but I cheered too. This really is a movie for everyone to watch.
B00A8ECU24|2.0|I could ignore the blatant attempts to force players into buying content with real cash in order to progress, or insane prices, but with the latest update the game is now barely playable and either runs impossibly slow or is full of bugs.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|Lots of fast paced fun. Engaging plot and characters. Kept us guessing. Good special effects. Intellectually and visually stimulating. Good to know there is a sequel planned.
B000068CNX|5.0|My husband and I love to watch these shows just before we go to bed at night. It is our way to relax with great light-hearted humor and fun-packed show.
B00G32OER4|4.0|Extra spooky.  BUY...the title makes no sense.  No one conjured anything...they were trying to get rid of it, not conjure it.  But other than that, very interesting story.
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|I first bought the book to support her and to let the Taliban know that others in the world are standing by her and against their campagin of terror.  When I finally took time to read it, it was worth the money to buy and time to read.  Amazing young woman.
B000WMFZMY|5.0|This a great Epic film. Action, Adventure, and Sofia Loren. This is Sofia at her Most Beautiful.(My Opinion)<br />And Charlton Heston is truly heroic. If you love a story with a larger than life hero, this is it.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Couldn't be easier to use and cleared up over 2G the first time I used it.  Highly recommend this app to keep your tablet clean and fast.
B00DGGIXS6|4.0|I like it, i love cher!!  I just wanted something different from her after all these years!!  Still has that powerful voice i love!!  Sometimes i felt the words and voice were lost in all the synthetics and etc!!
B004ZY0VHY|5.0|I couldn't put it down - thoroughly disturbing, but really makes you think. Hard to sympathize with the narrator - you find yourself going back and forth throughout the story. Wish I hadn't already read it, so I could read it again for the first time.
B009Y6UCRC|5.0|It does not matter if its Joe & Beth OR Beth & Joe but they are the best today and are even better together!!! Probably the best real music talent existing today:) Must Hear ro really appreciate..
B00C0ALZ0W|5.0|A short read, full of useful and insightful tips on remote working. Best of all, it's based on the authors' solid experiences over the past 8 years.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|Fun game to play when your borde and have nothing else to do so i think you should buy this game
B0019N8P2W|5.0|It was ok, I guess. In the way that picking a scab is ok. Or watching someone fall at the mall. I wish I had friends to watch it with. Actually, I don't. I hate people. (All kidding aside, Daria is amazing and you should watch this show. It has aged really well.)
B00ESY7QXI|5.0|This movie was almost a perfect reproduction of the book I read in High School. Leonardo DiCaprio performed as well as he ever has. Great movie.
B00BAXFAOW|5.0|I grew up on Elizabeth Ave. as the Street was transitioning  to essentially an all black community. Jonathan Schuppe  changed my view of the people now live there. He uses his skills as a reporter to provide an insight into the way people &#34; deal.&#34;  Most fascinating was that no one blamed others for their plight. A must read for social workers and politicians who claim to want to help but but seem not to be able to help at all.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I loved seeing the interaction between the characters, they were real.  The secret was not what I expected.  a page turner
B00C8S9VKM|5.0|Enthralling. Thoroughly enjoyed this book. All of Bill Bryson's books are Can't-put-it-down interesting, but this one was especially poignant because of the overlap of people and events. (you'll find yourself saying, &#34;I didn't know that, a lot.&#34; I followed it up by reading Dallas 1963 and followed that up just by reading today's NY Times. They all tie in together.<br />There is an additional bar stool benefit from the book-- it made me seem far more intelligent than I actually am.  (I may have forgotten to credit the book, but awed the listeners).
B001BKTEZA|5.0|The significance of the book is well known and well justified.  It is humbling to see how poorly Americans have treated each other and how people rise above such treatment.
B00G32OER4|4.0|The movie itself, content, actors, etc., was really good!  I was creeped out pretty much the whole movie.  But the quality of the movie sucked!<br />Maybe I should have ordered HD instead?
B00B7Y0206|5.0|minecraft is awesome sky is awesome and he makes visors for people so check out his chaney<br />and sky wants to say duck you
B000VSYDRM|1.0|I really, really, really hated it.  I wish I had stopped watching it after the first murder.  Woe is me/I.
B00F8GYC1Y|4.0|It's fun, but confusing as there are so many features I can't even figure out how to use them. But I'll keep trying.
B00G32OER4|5.0|Having watched many a ghost show in which Lorraine Warren played a role, I was excited to get a more in depth view of her and her husband with this movie.  Plus, I love horror movies.  These elements combined to provide me with a gripping , entertaining, and informative (about the Warrens) movie.  After the movie ended,  I was left asking myself, &#34;WHY DIDN'T I BUY THIS MOVIE?&#34;  I was scared that I would be disappointed and I was far from it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It is AWESOME FUN, THANK YOU FOR BRINGING IT TO Kindle Fire!!!! Thank you, thank you, THANK YOU!!! I am addicted!!!!
B002ZM74Y6|5.0|Great movie, not a dull moment in it.  The story is told very well and though some scenes are for adult eyes only it gives a better idea of that type of life.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I REALLY LOVE THIS APP. IT IS SO EASY TO USE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THAT IS ALL I HAVE TO SAY.
1451666179|5.0|This book is funny and poignant. Also, it is very colorful, which was a lovely surprise. I laughed, I cried and all around enjoyed it very much!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love the minions and I love this game it is so funny I'm on the beach right now and I don't have a costume.
B009VA1FN6|4.0|Well written; good story and believable characterizations and developments. Switching between present day and war time also handled well and held my interest through out.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|I love this book couldn't put it down the only reason I didn't give five stars was for dialogue of all the characters seemed to be sarcastic which made a bit unrealistic to me, but good read
1451695195|5.0|The price was good and the book arrived promptly and in excellent condition. I enjoyed reading it. Almost read like a novel even though this is a true story.
B00455F05Q|5.0|this film is a time capsule and should be required viewing for all high school history students. first, see this then see  stanley kubrick's  &#34;dr. strangelove&#34;
B009LDD1X0|5.0|I love Big Bang and am happy to have this season.  The DVD arrived quickly and in good shape so I'm a happy camper.
B000V63AVY|5.0|I'd forgotten the words, the tunes, and how great they were back in the day. Had to go back to remember. Truly one of the great superbands.  I can sing along they are so familiar. Went it the car as it's good driving music.
B005NKGEP2|5.0|I've never been a big fan of the spy novel-so often formulaic. I couldn't put thus one down wondering what twist was around the corner!
B003KVNV4S|5.0|The National is a musical experience you need to sit in a chair and really listen to it.  Reminds me of the lonely male solo in a club. Slow and deliberate. Good vocals. Good backup.  Good technically.
B00CL68BK2|5.0|Great Movie overall for romance and theme.  The blot could have been a bit better, but overall I liked it a lot
B00ETHPJ1U|4.0|Well, color me a bit disappointed in the packaging here.  After holding out for years on buying JEG's Bach cantata releases in the hopes they would be collected in one box set, I was excited to see this release on the schedule.  The recordings contained herein represent one of the most remarkable recording achievements ever undertaken, just like the music represents one of the finest composing achievements in Western history.  That being said, I was expecting a bit more robust - even luxurious? - packaging to house this set.  Don't get me wrong, it is sturdy enough, just not as beautiful as one might expect given the material.<br /><br />If one is new to this music, one could do worse than snap this up while it is still available.  Even at a few hundred dollars, it is an investment for a lifetime.  And, as another reviewer suggested, pick up Durr's book on Cantatas and settle in for one of the finest listening experiences you can have.
B00G32VYDG|4.0|3 of the 4 stars I give this movie is because of Jeff Bridges, a mix of the Dude and Rooster Cogburn.  This movie is basically Men in Black but with Dead & Undead instead of Aliens.  It makes me wish Jeff Bridges had been cast in Men in Black.
B00FFVLYTU|5.0|A well constructed script brought believably to life by a top notch cast and skillful production . If you like thoughtful police procedurals of the ilk of \\"The Killing\\", \\"Wallander\\", \\"Spiral\\", The Bridge (in original Danish) etc, you will enjoy this somewhat claustrophobic and emotional British TV drama. Story and characters build nicely around a credible plot.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I highly recommend THE DIVERGENT SERIES to any readers who enjoy dystopian novels! READ THIS BOOK NOW if you have read DIVERGENT and INSURGENT.  Do NOT look at SPOILERS.  Make your own judgments about this book and the series as a whole.<br />----------------------------<br />Tobias did believe in Tris's judgment at the end of Insurgent and played Jeanine's file for all the citizens to see.  It was a video message from the past stating that the inhabitants were placed there as an experiment and that once the population had a large percentage of people with divergent abilities that would be the time for Amity to allow people to leave their borders, to go to help whomever may be on the outside.<br />It's difficult to say much about this book without revealing what you should read and discover on your own.  There are very minor spoilers here.<br />Evelyn is still ruling the armed factionless and the community as a whole as a dictator.  A secret group of citizens who hold allegiance to the old faction system form with the intent of overthrowing Evelyn.  Tris, Four, Uriah, Christina, Caleb & Peter venture past Amity and make their way to a compound where the government agency responsible for establishing and monitoring the genetic experiments in former Chicago is.  The group have a lot to learn about the compound, their history in the experiment, and the world.  The agency welcomes the group and introduces them to their beliefs and ways.  Tris and Tobias had mended their relationship by the end of Insurgent, but find that with the new territory of the compound comes brand new issues that test them and their relationship.  When they learn the compound scientists intend to meddle with the people in the Chicago experiment in a major way, they must decide if they should take action and if so, what it should be.<br />I enjoyed having the story told in alternating POV's of Tris and Tobias.  In this way we learn what each of them are feeling, withholding, and why.  I think theaddition of Tobias' POV adds range to the book.  There were major twists at the end of the book that result in many readers being outraged.  Frankly, I didn't find the biggest twist shocking.  In fact beliefs and decisions throughout the trilogy lead clearly to the twist, in retrospect.  I really believe that Allegiant's big twist and the ending are beautiful, once the surprise wears off.  I loved Allegiant and will be re-reading the whole Divergent series in the future.<br />My favorite quote from the book is from Tris regarding Tobias:<br />\\"Just as I have insisted on his worth, he has always insisted on my strength, insisted that my capacity is greater than I believe.  And I know, without being told, that's what love does when it's right- it makes you more than you were, more than you thought you could be.\\"
B009LDD54K|5.0|the quality of the whole show the acting ,casting and sets bring you to Atlantic City before the Casinos cant wait for season 4
0061900656|5.0|We are expecting baby #2 in December, so I wanted to get a couple books to read to my 3-year-old on the subject. This book is just too sweet and perfect for a young child who is about to become a big brother! The text is simple, yet it teaches the older sibling what it means to be a big brother without being too preachy or boring. The pictures are colorful and really drive home the points made int the story.<br /><br />My son has increased the talk about how he will help with his baby brother next month! I am so happy that he's so excited and ready to help out.
1250030951|5.0|Gah! And I thought that I was in love with Eleanor & Park? Pfft! This is absolutely perfect. Maybe because I'm obsessed with fanfiction, I don't know. Although I couldn't bring myself to read all of the Simon Snow excerpts, I was still on point with the story as a whole. So many emotions in this novel, and you can only sympathize with Cath because at some point in your life you've felt her pain. Her nervousness... her self consciousness.... her anger..... her everything in this book!!! Definitely recommend this book to anyone who can appreciate a great story!
B002DOSBMK|5.0|This series of books follows Drizzt from his birth far into his future. The story is about being wise enough to know when things around you are wrong even if you and the people around you have been raised to believe it is right. Its about not accepting those wrong things and striving to hold onto your self in the midst of it. Its about how one person in some ones life that pushes them in the right direction can change things for that person and leave ripples enough to begin to pull down the evil from its ledges and stab it with a scimitar :-p.<br /><br />These books defiantly have dark over tones to them and can be quite emotionally mature in their content however it is important to see where Drizzt has come from and to be able to understand the kind of man the character becomes as he grows despite all his hardship and family issues.<br /><br />It is interesting to explore the underdark and see it from the side of the dark elves to get a peak at their motives and reasons for being as evil as most of them are. If you are at all interested in the D and D universe and have played the game you should definitely read these books, Even if you haven't played D and D these books still stand as a great fantasy series.
B003EPPEP4|4.0|I purchased this CD on the advice of other reviews and am glad I did.<br /> This is a new artist with a new style and voice that is brought to us....<br /><br />Nikke brings her own style of Blue to us that I think you will be happy to have,<br /> Try her out, You maybe happy you did as I was  meeting a new artist......
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This book is a true with of art. I am incredibly happy I read it. The movie is a lot different, but this is still incredibly amazing. I am absolutely beat tears with the heart that the author put into it. Please read it
B00007FOMP|5.0|If you missed Marvin when he was alive and performing ,<br />This CD will make you know that you missed something magic.<br /><br />This is Mo Town and Detroit at it's peak. What a incredible voice and writer he was......<br /> This music I have a feeling will live on for many more Generation.........<br />and only rightly should,<br />It's great
B009YP9L7U|5.0|It was a cute read.  Exactly what you'd expect from a  Harlequin romance book.  I really liked the characters portrayed in this book and the story line.
B007KDFWRG|5.0|This Emmy Award winning couple make the Emmy's prestigious reputation come alive and reassure you that this married couple prove that two can indeed work together and produce outstanding sounds
B003V2HWP0|5.0|It was a very beautiful movie. If anyone wants to get into a love story this is a good one.
B00G32OER4|5.0|This is one of my new fave scary movies just love that it is scary and true. It makes your heart pump because you don't know what will happen next
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|A comic book based film true to its griddy dark violent heritage.  Karl urban plays the law man to a dark night standard.
B004QZ9PLU|4.0|Keeps you drawn in. Gives reader mixed feelings on which way they want the story to end. I felt the end was too cut and dryed. The story kind of lost the emotional impact that the story as a whole had imparted to the reader.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I read this book at the request of my 14 year old daughter who had already read it at school. I have read many stories about WWII in the past, but none that I can remember affecting me so stongly. We often forget the effect the war had on the German people both Jewish and non-Jewish. This story as told by death, shows both of those sides. He tells how many of the German people were forced to do things they did not believe in just to survive themselves and how many risked their own lives to save others. This is a must read.
B00DWZHTOU|5.0|First let me tell you that I prefer chick flicks. This wasn't one. It had more than enough action for me. I thought the acting was great with terrific actors. The movie held my attention the whole time. It felt like I had just sat down to start the movie. The conclusion pulled everything together. I had to watch it again to make sure I didn't miss anything and it went just as fast and was just as good the second time around.
0307950654|1.0|Ugh. 'nough said. Talk about phoning it in. I could written this drivel. As a Jane Austen fan I was sucked in by a need to revisit Mr. Darcy. Don't bother.
B0088W6LGY|5.0|Great series I've watched it several times! It's one of the better shows that had come on  that year by day the best one
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|Game is a lot of fun. I wish that it moved along a little faster. Seems slow getting started. For a free game it is fun.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Love this game, it's a great time passer and relaxing game. I play it every night to relax after work.
B00FHAB3HW|5.0|This album is very diverse. I think Miley did a great job with this album.  She tried something new and  worked for her good job miley cyrus
1484156005|5.0|I really enjoyed this very well written love story. The tale is set in Vienna many years ago, at a time when Jewish people were still being persecuted. Sixteen year old Sebastian was a young lad who lost part of his leg. He got an infection from a rusty nail and failed to seek medical treatment in time to save his leg. Later, another infection caused him to lose even more of his leg. The Jewish family included Franz, the father, who was disappointed in his only son's weakness. Vera, the mother, blamed herself for Sebastian's problems. The grandparents, Rebecca and Oscar, also lived with the family who owned a store in Vienna. The family hired a young maid, Ingeborg. She was fired after being caught having an affair with the father. Vera, the mother, hired another maid named Eva who preferred women over men, unbeknownst to Franz. I probably would have done the same thing under the circumstances.<br /><br />After his father was sent off to fight in the war, young Sebastian took over running the store. He was devastated when his grandfather, Oscar, passed away very suddenly. Sebastian had been very close to his grandfather who tutored him after his surgeries. Vera, the mother, hired another young maid, Margit, who came in a \\"package deal\\" with her mother who had mental issues. Sebastian soon fell in love with Margit and they had a child out of wedlock. By now, Franz had been declared missing in the war. Sebastian and Margit did not want to marry until a proper period of mourning had been observed for Franz. This book is fast paced and full of love, drama, adventure, and more. As a bonus, I learned about Vienna and what it was like to live there during the war when food and money were in short supply. I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good romantic story.
1400052181|4.0|This book is very, very interesting!!! I couldn't put it down!! It's a true story that faces you with a harsh reality of  unfairness... A part of history that I think we should all know... We can forgive but never forget... If you like true stories that take you back to some history that you would not normally hear about then get that book.. It will leave you wondering...
B00FPH6AXE|1.0|What a waste!  Will Smith's son shouldn't quit his day job, but should take acting lessons to try to cultivate any latent talents he may have as an actor.  This is one of the worst three movies I have ever been duped into watching in my entire life.  I watched this movie on a rental DVD,  boy, was I surprised (sarcasm) to see it had gone straight to cable with NO FEE to watch.  Throughout the entire movie, Will Smith has this stupid look on his face.  I guess that was his interpretation of what the human race will look like in the future-God help us.  I expected a movie of \\"I Robot\\" quality, what I got was a son that obviously has very little acting ability and WOW, \\"who could guess why he is even in a movie.\\"  The whole thing was quite awkward with absolutely no chemistry between the father and son.  I'm usually a Wil Smith fan and if this review seems excessively harsh, I'm sorry.  But I hope it will save others from wasting 2 hours of their life.
B0000E1WKE|4.0|Whitney...Whitney...Whitney...Gotta give it up for another legend!! Loved the old Whitney ( pre-drugs).. No one could touch her voice back then.!!!! I respected the fact that she tried to make a come back but drugs tear you down!! The CD is very,very nice and a must to have during Christmas time...Just close your eyes while holding your favorite wine and listen to the beautiful voice of Whitney.. You won' t be disappointed!!May God rest her soul!!!!
032147404X|4.0|Very informative book for camera's and taking pictures, the reason i only gave it 4 stars is it realy didn't get into taking pictures of jewelry which is some of what i was looking for.
B005QYKD4I|3.0|I watched the first two  movies and got to know Mikaela as Sam's girlfriend and as a fellow hero. When they said \\"I love you\\" I cheered . And now here's this Carly person and I'm like where's Mikaela? Very disappointing. No continuation of the story.
B003M70O5O|5.0|Fantastic show! It's like a Greek tragedy or epic poem like the Iliad a long rough voyage full of wars and monsters.
B00FWLDHSY|1.0|Only watches the first 25 minutes and couldn't take it anymore.  Definitely a C rated movie in my opinion. Not sure what the directors were trying to accomplish with this movie.
B00GD9F59S|5.0|Truth be told I can't write a full review right now. I am just to freakin' overcome with emotion to really make a coherent sentence. That said, I couldn't wait another second to give it the ZILLION STARS it so deserves. This series.....well there are no flippin' words. I am devastated that it is over, but beyond ecstatic at how JLA brought it to the most EPIC (and I hate that word) ending EVER! Just....WOW! I will miss every single one of these fan-freakin-tastic characters. Deacon, Solos, Luke, Marcus, Olivia, Lea, Caleb, Apollo, Alex, Seth, and AIDEN! Just....<3. You rock my world Jennifer L. Armentrout.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I bought this series for my tablet...and grew a love/hate relationship with it. The story is so well written with such HUMAN characters that I found my favorite characters often changing. OR I'd end up screaming at my tablet because clearly a character was making a dumb decision. I've already bought and started reading the fifth installment.... I'm eager to see how things wrap up... if they do :)
B00BBI9WD6|5.0|David Weber is a joy to read in this series.  Honor is a very special character, and one we love to read.  Highly recommend the whole series to those who love space opera.
B00F880BWG|5.0|The plot line is thicker, character development is changing, special effects are superb and their struggles are becoming widespread-time to leave the confines of the prison.
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|Another action packed Pendergast novel. Plenty of twists and turns, surprises and lots of dangling threads to pick up for the next book!

B009KKLQKO|5.0|This CD is going to surprise a lot of people. The quality of the music and vocals were amazing. These guys must have spent a lot of time rehearsing and it shows. All of the songs were done like the originals. They all sounded great. Brian Wilson was naturally the crowd favorite and he did not disappoint. He sounded better than he has in decades. Mike Love and Al Jardine were both awesome.Bruce Johnston did a great rendition of Disney Girls and his vocals were obvious on many of the songs. It was also nice to see David Marks back with the band. He is a great guitar player! The backup guys singing harmony were time warped from the 60s. This was the best live Beach Boys concert in decades.
B009RX7IX8|5.0|Castle is one of my favorite tv shows on today.  Its right up there with NCIS; Rizzoli & Isles; NCIS:LA; Law and Order : SVU and Bones.<br /><br />Love it<br /><br />I watch the new episodes every Monday night.

It was also nice to see David Marks back with the band. He is a great guitar player! The backup guys singing harmony were time warped from the 60s. This was the best live Beach Boys concert in decades.
B00018D3RI|5.0|Starsky and Hutch Season one is awesome.  I discovered this show in the early 1980s when I was a very young girl.  If you like old cop shows with great car chases, you will love this season.
B0091REZMW|2.0|The game keeps closing on it's own love the game,however this prob has gotten so bad sometime I have to open it 4 -5 Times before I can play then I get this mystery manor not responding, and it closes. And of course I lose.<br />I keep getting a notice of an update however I can't get to it either
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|Awesome movie<br /><br />A must for all Star Trek fans.  I really enjoyed this movie.  It has everything that a trekker would love.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Oh such a great show.  The characters were so funny and showed such depth in their acting. The show is placed in a little hamlet close to a larger town.  From the small children to the adults it was great interaction. Poor families struggling to get by each day with the help of their neighbors and friends.  I am almost through with the series, but will start again when the grandchildren come to visit.
B00A8V3VVG|4.0|This soundtrack compliments the movie.  I am glad that I purchased this CD.  I watched the movie before I bought the soundtrack.  If you like movie soundtracks, you may enjoy this CD.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Intense game however seems to not save your found clues then you have to repeat finding your clues.  A help guide would be greatly appreciated.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app !  This is by far my favorite version that I've found its easy to use and you can also bookmark your favorite verses !
1476733953|5.0|I was amazed by this work.  It's unique.  It's engrossing.  It is written in such a way that you are pulled forward by the need to know what happens next, which is surprisingly difficult to guess, but foreshadowed elegantly enough to click satisfyingly into place when finally revealed.  At times I literally had to lay my hand across the paragraphs at the bottom of the page to keep my eyes from skipping forward to satisfy a need to know that was burning every bit as brightly within my mind as it was for the characters themselves racing to solve it.<br /><br />All in all, a very sound investment of your time.
B00C7607BC|5.0|Classic movie and Disney interpretation of the classic Hans Christian Anderson story. Love it! Bought it for my own personal collection.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love the storyline.  It has a lot of action.  A love story.  Peeta really cares for Katniss but she cannot see it.  I love the science fiction.  It makes you wonder what things are being developed in labs today.
B005544TRQ|5.0|This show is never predictable.  There is always a surprise.  The development of the characters is ongoing, and I like the fact that the story line focuses on the personal lives of the characters as well as the cases they are working on.
B00FPH6AXE|1.0|Bored did not like the story bad acting bored did I say bored I fell asleep bored  bored bored bored
B0031RS2HC|5.0|A brilliant read.  Fast paced and kept me reading until the wee hours.  Can't wait to download the next one.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|FANTASTIC game!!  So many beautiful details to keep you fascinated for hours but with the hints you will never be frustrated if you get stuck.
B00FFVML74|5.0|This series is great because the drama in it immerses you in the actual seaside town where a young child is killed and the question of whom the killer is just gets you more and more interested in it.  Also David Tennant and Arthur Devill from Doctor Who is it (which is amazing!!!). David Tennant is a detective with a really thick scottish accent and Arthur(Rory from Dr. Who) is the town's church father who gives kick ass sermons. I was so into the series I watched all of them in one night.
B00ADS90EQ|5.0|Really liked this movie. Anna Kendrick was perfect in her role. This is definitely PG13.I thought it would be appropriate for my 11 year old but really wasn't:-(. Although I would watch it again just not with the kids.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Although this is a very simplistic game be WARNED it is extremely addictive. Voted \\"Best Social Game\\" at the International Mobile Gaming Awards, \\"Candy Crush Saga takes the popular match-three style of game to another level by adding a variety of special game pieces (candies), \\"boosters,\\" and objectives that go beyond simply scoring a lot of points.

B0071XO8RA|4.0|A very interesting story.  I love to discover new authors.  Can't wait to find out what happens next!  I'll definitely recommend this to my friends.
0439023521|4.0|This book is very popular among young adults. If youre looking for the next big series you want read, this is the book. I like to think of this book as the next Percy Jackson like series because of it's compelling characteristic. Once you start reading the book you won't be able to put it down and the intenseness will have you cringing and wanting more. The characters are extreamly likeable and ones teenagers can really relate to. The combination of action, drama, and the just the sear brutness of the book makes it, that more exciting. Themes like (teenage anguish, love, work, poverty and more are seen throughout the book, What makes this book great is that it's not to long but man can it grab your attention.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I just got it an  I already like it funny thing is if u like subway surf u would love this game it is the same I mean the same u should really get this game if it really good at subway surf then u will get a lot of bananas on this game !!!
B00G8YVVYG|5.0|If you want to see a tv show that displays the most action packed into a single episode this is the show for you. Plus Zombies!!!!!!!!!!!!! and the entire aspect of survival apocalyptic world adds some intensity. Theres nothing better than watching the most realistic drama about killing zombies.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|This game is awesome and super fun i love playing it I've barely gotten off since i got it really.
B008I6ZX1E|5.0|I absolutely love this series.  The story is very complex and intertwined, yet so intriguing that feels like you are in the midst of it.  Writing is beautiful and the words flow from the page like honey.  I hope some day I'll have a chance to meet the author and express my gratitude in person.
B00DW36G32|5.0|one of the best one against one old war old memories and legends unite to make an awesome killing machine against machine the only really bad thing in this movie is travolta's accent it sucks he should have just used the regulat american accent at least it would have been understandable
B00ARN0XGG|4.0|This was the most entertaining of the four movies. Not something that will live in your memory for very long, but a good way to kill a boring night.
B00992CF6W|4.0|the game is great and im not saying that because i am a fan of minecraft but the updates could come a bit sooner
B004TMPJP6|2.0|I ended up deleting this. I'm looking for that perfect list maker that just helps me keep track of appointments shopping lists and so forth. this one just seemed like a blank slate and I didn't have the patience to deal with figuring it out. Still looking for that one perfect app :)
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Great show would like to be able to see all the other seasons for free but guess l'll have to wait.
1616550414|5.0|Great book; got it for my brothers birthday.. he loves it!! Also, shipped on time.. this book is a great addition to anyones collection
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|the only problem with the game is it takes to ling to give you lives to play but other than that its a good game
B007KWD7BK|5.0|This album is very slow, prolonged and may loose you at points. Remember that their original record label refused to even release this album, due to the fact that they thought it was garbage. But if you are a fan of the slower style of metal or you are a fan of Al Cisneros, its a must hear. I recommend this album to any metal fan, buy it.
B00BEIYMZ6|3.0|I went to watch this because the premise of four strangers forced into pretending to be a family to smuggle marijuana across the border seemed so promising as a comedy. Sadly, the movie fell flat. The acting was solid and the situations had great potential but the characters were two-dimensional, the script was sub-par and, despite the \\"R\\" rating, I expected the dialogue not to drop the F-bomb seemingly every other line. Having spent $6.50 on a matinee that disappointed me, I won't spend over three times that much for a home video disc to watch it again. If you're a big Sudeikis, Aniston, or Roberts fan you might consider it.
B00FPGSPQU|3.0|The Trilogy to this series I would have to say is the second best. It was pretty stupid, but still decent. If you enjoyed the first and second than its definitely worth seeing once. I recommend the rental option over the purchase option, just my opinion.
B008JFUTUY|5.0|Even having known the music and the story ahead of time, this is a story full of twists and turns that keeps the viewer's full attention.  The story lends itself to a movie format though in fact it is a documentary.  Put this on your must have list if you are any kind of music or movie fan at all.
B0053F042G|4.0|It's rare to see good sci-fi these days!  This is a must see for anyone who likes to think from time to time.  It was like Groundhog Day, but serious.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I'm havong trouble getting the app to download my address. I type it in and it just says &#34;locating,&#34; spins, and does nothing. Not helpful
B001IF277K|4.0|Bought this as a replacement for my husband's phone battery. He said so far it's been lasting him a day and a half... but then he doesn't use wifi very much. I will update later.
B00BVMXBDO|4.0|A strange one, really keeps you guessing- you think you've gotten something figured out and you get another surprise. Sort of a sci fi/ cop drama, &#34;Orphan Black&#34;keeps up the mystery and adds a fair amount of action too.<br /><br />Tatiana Maslany isn't the first actor/ actress to portray multiple roles but she is very impressive with multiple accents (she seems very good at it to my ear) and &#34;looks&#34;. I'm waiting to see how she'll do in second season, season 1 was so complex and well done it will be hard to equal. I don't usually watch cop shows but this is one I'll be watching.<br /><br />The DVD extras are the weakest part of this set, of the 4 BBC &#34;Insiders&#34; bits- &#34;Three clones, one frame&#34;- is the best for me. It shows something of the amount of work involved in one actress playing three roles in one scene.<br /><br /> It's BBC but filmed in Canada although I don't think the episodes ever make that clear (one brief shot of some currency shows something not British or American)- only &#34;Aynsley&#34; born in Britain and Mrs. S ( she's Sarah's foster mother-season 1 ends with a lot of mystery on her part) born in Ireland aren't Canadian.
B00FJTYDKK|5.0|My kids loved this movie! They laughed outloud and my son exclaimed more than once, &#34;I love the Croods!&#34; A great family movie.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Great app for Kindle. No complaints or issues that I have encountered. Way better playing on Kindle than my small smartphone screen. In three words. GET THIS APP.
B003Y5H57E|5.0|I love this movie, a great love comedy. If you love steve carrell and/or ryan gosling, this is a great movie for you. Both of their personalities shine through their characters.<br /><br />The Blu ray quality probably isn't needed, but its a good comfort to have. Wish this came in one of those dvd, blu ray combo packs but this is still just as good.
B000NQRR1Q|2.0|A rare book expert with grifter tendencies is hired by a billionaire to find the other two copies of a rare Satanic book he owns and to compare them. Why? The billionaire, played by Frank Langella, will only say coyly that he believes that only one copy is genuine; he refuses to say why he believes this. The book expert (Johnny Depp as Frank Corso) doesn't find this credible but is lured in by the huge sum of money he is offered for the task, which becomes increasingly dangerous and confusing. I found this film very disappointing and I will discuss my reasons below, but be warned that there are some spoilers.<br /><br />Spoiler alert! You've been warned! Like Frank Corso, the character played by Depp, I found this all rather confusing. The film seems oddly flat and lacking in emotion for a horror film. I didn't understand it at all until I saw, on Wikipedia, some comments from the director taken from an interview with Peter Howell for the Toronto Star newspaper: \\"I don't believe in the occult...You can make them (horror genre cliches) appear serious on the surface, but you cannot help but laugh at them.\\" In other words the director wasn't approaching this as a serious horror film but rather as a subtle comedy. The whole thing is comprehensible once you know this, and it occurred to me that the Frank Corso character as portrayed in this film may be most comparable to that of Peter Sellers' brilliant, bumbling Inspector Clouseau: a poor git who is incapable of seeing himself as others see him and is thus unable to understand that the chaos and confusion around him are in fact being caused by him. Ironically the one thing I did like in the film was the music, which was based on the Havanaise in E major Opus 83 by Saint-Saens. My sister commented that a lot of people found it too perky and upbeat (which again is understandable once you realize what the director was doing) but I found it creepy and it reminded me of the theme from Jaws in the sense that it made me thinkthat something horrific really was going to happen. Do I think that the director made a valid film? Yes. Do I agree with his choices? No, and I wonder how the Spanish writer of the original source book (Arturo Perez Reverte, The Club Dumas) felt about the film. I also found myself wondering if the director's choice to subtly mock the whole thing was due to events in his own life. Did the horrific murder of his wife in the 60's leave him feeling that horror is a joke compared to what humans actually do? Did the accusations against the director for misconduct with an underage girl leave him reluctant to probe the idea of evil at all? We cannot know the answers.<br /><br />I sincerely hope that another director will eventually film this as a genuine horror film because it could be a classic. For example the scene where Boris Balkan pours gasoline on himself and lights it in the belief that he is being transformed into a minion of Satan and is thus unburnable could have been really scary if he had collapsed to a cloud of black ash in the blink of an eye--and if perhaps part of the castle had done the same--but instead we get the director's dry humor as Balkan slowly catches fire, shrieks \\"No! Oh, no!\\" over and over, and realizes too late that he is the same sort of pathetic boob that he has accused others of being. The scene outside the castle where Corso is seduced by the green-eyed woman--a scene that is arguably one of the least sexy sex scenes ever filmed and where Johnny Depp's facial expressions range from a deer caught in the headlights of an oncoming semi truck, to that of someone who has just been told that he is next going to have a colonoscopy--could have been both sexy and scary. Imagine if the two people had remained in the car and the camera had been outside the car, so that we see only vague shadows in the car but do see articles of clothing being flung out through the open car door and hear the kind of heavy breathing and grunting that would convince usthat Corso is becoming the sort of goatish creature we would expect. Sadly that is not what we got and this is not a horror film; those who expect one will be disappointed, as I was.
B003E6FGI8|5.0|The storyline is so well done, it keeps you guessing at every turn. It can get a bit overwhelming at times to keep track of who knows what, and most of all, trying to guess what's going to happen and why (especially with those flashforwards).<br />In any case, it's hard to not watch the next episode.
B00BEIYMAG|1.0|A family moves to an old, isolated farmhouse and soon regrets it. The mother seeks help from a famous pair of paranormal investigators; they soon regret it, too. I regretted watching it, for reasons I will discuss below; spoilers!<br /><br />Spoilers here! You've been warned! I was so disappointed in this film and I was so surprised to be disappointed because I had seen the trailer and it looked so good and so scary. Well, that trailer was better than the film. Worse yet that scene in the trailer with the laundry blowing in the wind proved to be only a split second in length in the film. What a waste! And talk about unintentionally funny, wow. At one point in the film Mrs. Warren, who claims to be a medium, researches the history of the house and announces fearfully to her husband that it was built by a man who married a woman who had been accused of witchcraft at Salem. Oh noes! Because of course she must really have been a witch! Apparently it never occurred to Mrs. Warren that being a medium was hardly an acceptable line of work for a nice Catholic mom in the 70's and that a couple hundred years earlier she herself would have been accused of witchcraft. Burned at the stake too, most likely, and by her own church! It gets worse: Mr. Warren criticizes the beseiged father because--gasp!--his kids aren't baptized! Well, he conveniently doesn't ask if the parents were baptized--I'm betting they were--and it sure didn't help Mom, did it? The movie is full of moments like those. It is also full of every sort of derivative stuff from other movies and TV shows, so much so that you could play a game with it. Give yourself credit if you recognize: the Annabelle doll from Mysteries at the Museum. Being dragged by the foot, from Paranormal Activity. The dead child who insists on being noticed from The Changeling. The paranormal investigation team ala Ghost Hunters. The unbelieving investigator who ends up believing from Amityville Horror. The creepy closet that parallels theTV in Poltergeist. The flocks of crazed birds from The Birds. The girl dragged around the room by an unseen entity from An American Haunting. The possessed mother who bites an investigator in the neck from The Walking Dead. Yes, I commented drily to my sister that it appeared to me that she wasn't possessed, she was turning into a zombie and it was too bad they didn't have cameo appearances by Carl and Daryl from that show. They'd have known how to deal with Mom and they'd have put both her and the poor audience out of their misery. What a joke. As for the Warrens, I don't know whether to think that they were grifters who preyed on the fearful or people who had problems of their own. Was Mrs. Warren's being a \\"medium\\" merely an effort by her to work through some sort of trauma in her own life? Did their cases, which forced her to confront \\"monsters\\" over and over, come from something in her early life such as incest or molestation? Who knows but the film was a mess and I'd love to see what the little robots from Mystery Science 3000 would say about it. Update: Oh, and give yourself extra credit points if you connect the laundry scene with its earlier inspiration: the classic M. R. James story, Oh Whistle And I'll Come To You.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Grisham at his best. Read 'em all. Made better as sequel to &#34;A Time To Kill&#34;. Good twists. Not too much legal technicalities and true to regional ethos.
B00797MB0O|4.0|While there are some moments that are quite funny, this is really a dark, sad drama. I think other reviewers have misunderstood it if they are looking for another \\"Juno\\". A unique perspective for a movie. I certainly recommend watching it for the insight into life.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Product works as expected and delivered in a timely manner. I use it on multiple tvs throught the house and can now control it on both my phone or laptop.
B004ZMWUCU|3.0|It is a good book.  The 3-star rating relates to the ending, which is rushed once again.  Why, oh why, do these authors take all the time in the world to craft a good book, with character development and a plot that holds your interest, only to rush on to an ending that is somewhat unsatisfying?  At times the dialogue was hard to follow because of the dialect that the author used in the book, but it was overall an interesting story with some depth to it.  It was good, but again the ending left me flat.  I kept wanting to turn the page to the next chapter because it felt like there should be more.  I actually checked it twice to make sure i didn't miss something, but no I didn't.  It just ended.  Oh well.....
B001VU1NJ0|5.0|I enjoyed the ensemble cast for sure, but it was Sean Penn that made this movie fir me. He made the character come alive and you felt everything he wanted you to. Loved it.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Good reading as usual for Follett but not his best. But then all authors have  variation in their writings. Follett has been and is among the best in his genre.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|My 12 year old daughter read this last year and LOVED IT. I recently read it and loved it too. Even cried at the end. A wonderful read for young adults and their parents.
B00FJTYDKK|5.0|There are many times my husband and I reluctantly settle in for a \\"family movie night\\" knowing that we are more than likely going to be less than entertained.  But this weekend we were pleasantly surprised with The Croods.  We watched this movie with five kids, ages ranging from 5 to 17, and every one of us laughed at some of the scenes and situations that took place.  The next day, our 12 year old son started quoting lines from the movie (something boys and men tend to do with their favorites), so I knew that this movie was a big hit.  The kids even asked to watch it again the next day.  If you are looking for a movie with humor, adventure, and a sweet message about valuing your family (even if you don't always get along), I highly recommend The Croods!  ~~PringlesGuy's Wife
B0082Z447U|4.0|it's a mystery but there is little adventure.  the story is slow going and the ende telegraphs ahead.  a good old fashioned read.

B00E8KLWB4|4.0|A little different from the hidden object games I normally play but I am intrigued enough to continue trying it out. I like that you are rewarded for coming back to the game for several days in a row, hopefully meaning that this game cannot be beaten in my average of 2-3 days...
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Interesting plot line in a period piece. Lots of twists and turns, and acting is top notch. Looking forward to next season.
B004KPLVW2|5.0|This is a great copy of &#34;Tron&#34;. They included a bunch of special features they filmed when working on &#34;Legacy&#34; and threw them on this disc. It also has an extensive commentary track for the super dorks out there ... like me.

B002RI9S2Y|5.0|Action filled book. Humorous writing and likeable main characters. I quite like how Percy does not know many stories, like many of the readers, so it's explained to him and us when necessary; we're not information dumped by the narrator.<br /><br />A problem with the kindle version is that several times there's a missing word in a sentence (e.g. To, a, the), missing apostrophes (well instead of we'll) and there was one typo I caught (how instead of bow in &#34;even strength has to bow to wisdom sometimes&#34;).<br /><br />Other than that, an enjoyable read.

B004J4WNL2|5.0|This book is well-written and thoroughly researched. It gave me insight into my own introverted character. I like how Cain explores many ideas, particularly the Extroverted Ideal, and cites the work of many researchers to validate her points. The anecdotes make the book readable: it's a piece for everyone to access and understand.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I play in the house, in the doctor's office, the dentist chair. It is addictingly fun! Try it, you'll get addicted, too.
B00C2PO09I|5.0|Really nice transfer, the Blu-Ray looks great! Although not for everyone I enjoyed this film. Really neat story with great visuals. Almost like a futuristic fairy tail. Pink bees are essential and love is stronger than gravity!
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I loved the other two books, I could not them down!!This was such a disappointment, Ialmost wish I never read the first one so that I didn't feel so let down by this book. It was boring and the ending just leaves you feeling like the whole series was a waste of time. I should have stopped at book two. Or not bought the book so quickly and waited for reviews.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|When I read the reviews for this book they all said don't read it the ending was awful. I ignored them because I was planning on reading the book eventually and that everyone has their own opinion... unfortunately the reviews were correct. The first books were so good I thought for sure the 3rd book couldn't never have a bad ending so please, please, please do not read this book make up your own ending. You'll save yourself a lot of grief.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game, especially multiplayer. Its fun to make like a whole city and stuff. I have a plan to make a twenty story building in a city.
B00DGGIXS6|4.0|Wow!  The girl still has chops!  I'm not a huge Cher fan.  Bought the cd on the recommendation of a friend- kind of a sentimental thing- but was really impressed!
B000HZGNHW|3.0|Entertaining but you have to take a leap of faith to get totally involved in the story.  Not as good as the later version made in 2003.
0756407125|5.0|This story builds on that of the first novel in this series by Pathrick Rothfuss.  The first novel was fantastic. I could not put it down.  This next installment worked in the same way.  It had a different feel, at parts, but this is due to the advancement in the story told by the main character.  His situation had altered, and so the feeling of the paradigm changed with it. The end of this book left me impatiently waiting for the next installment.<br /><br />I do not like putting spoilers and plot details into reviews, so I will avoid that here.  I will say this.  If you enjoy any fantasy, I would be incredibly surprised if you did not like this novel.  It is not High Fantasy (In the Tolkien sense), but has a traditional fantasy setting, backed up by an amazing story, a set of VERY interesting characters, and the ability to draw me in and keep me entranced.  Don't miss this series.
B00EXVZZE8|4.0|This game is so cute--a talkative cat, an evil anti cat  and an adorable pet to take care of. This game also includes different ways to play with this lolz cat but I love it 5 stars.
B004GYY714|5.0|I like it. It's much easier to tune in to my favorite stations with Tune In than going to each station separately.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Didn't think I would like but I gave it a try anyway. Surprisingly fun. I wish I had started playing much sooner.

B003NRYMZQ|5.0|Such good fun. There is nothing like a bunch of english folk running around after aliens. It really does remind me of Buffy the Vampire slayer, though, with the humor and the horror side by side.
0143145010|5.0|Great book! I was one of many PTS guys and luved many of the stoies relsted in the book. The insite into the many nuclear accidents an policies are educational and eye opening.
B005MMZ63C|2.0|I know that this was a ground breaking movie when it was filmed, but I just couldn't get past the over dramatization.  I feel sorry that I couldn't stick with it but I knew I could find something more interesting.
B0026S93C0|5.0|A splendid &#34;feel good&#34; film.  You keep pulling for the young heroine and wanting to give her a good spanking occasionally.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I may be a girl but i love this its so cool. it doesn't  just give you deer you also hunt bears ducks wolves and even lions!

B00ECTZKJ6|5.0|This is easily their best album since Take A Look In The Mirror. It's the old Korn with Head back in the band.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Love the graphics,100% addictive!!!!!<br />Easy to play, even easier to play for hour's. Love the blood splatter, great perk!!!!<br />Amazing game!!!!!
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|I have loved Mark Twain books since I was kid and this was a great addition to my kindle library. Now I can read one of my favorite stories as often as I like and share with my daughter.
0375812024|5.0|The story in this book is funny. The picture could explain many interesting things about airport activities. Very interesting. My son loves it.
B001DPHDCY|5.0|Love this movie. We have had it for a long time and stil watch it for family fun nights when everyone is home.
B0091WNK8M|5.0|Best movie ever! I would strongly encourage parents to purchase this for their kids.  The plot and teenage angst has not changed.  Blu Ray has increased the clarity but it doesn't make it  as clear as the original was 27 years ago- you can only improve so much
B00AGOGOLE|3.0|Don't like that there is no viewfinder.  Works okay, except for that.  Nice to be able to take photos with kindle.
B0093QHWLC|4.0|Very good movie but was not in High definition. I'm able to stream Netfix in HD but not Amazon. Have not been able to figure it out.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Really enjoyed this book and visiting the folks once again from A Time to Kill. While the ending was a little predictable, Grisham did an excellent job of developing all the characters. Highly recommend to all readers.
1250029465|5.0|A chance encounter with a poor, neglected cat that changed the author's life! Very uplifting and inspiring. A must read for cat lovers.
B008JFUPK8|4.0|Let me start by being honest to myself. Man of Steel is not a great movie, and far from being a Great Superman movie. It was supposed to be the best movie of the Summer 2013, even for the entire year 2013 and it was far behind movies like Pacific Rim, Iron man 3, and others. I'm a huge fan of the Superman Character, but we have to admit the facts. There was not a real story, not a real plot, and poor character development.I'm not getting into d&eacute;tails for each scene, but let's face it guys, when you Watch a superhero movie, there's a time during the movie, you kind of wanting to be that superhero. There was not a single scene where people wanted to be superman. Do you remember the First superman movie when Superman saves Lois from falling from the building \\" I got you mam \\" ? And \\" Who's got you \\" ? When the helicopter was gonna fall on them ? When you Watch that scene, even now, in 2013, it gives you goosebumps. Do you remember in Superman II when Superman showed up to face General Zod and his clan ? The newpapers were flying all over, people were looking in the sky and Superman showed up outside from the window and ask General Zod to come outside ? That scene was phenomenal . Do you remember when Superman, in Superman returns saved the plane and its passengers from crashing, even before when he was flying after the plane, and went through the second wing  ? OMG, these sc&egrave;nes make you Wonder in the theater \\" Why can't I have power to save people and do great things like him \\" ?  But there was nowhere in Man of Steel where you wanted to be Superman, absolutely nowhere. I expected Snyder to reach the level of Richard Donner or Lester with the Superman franchise, but I think he failed. It's so evident that he has to bring Batman back to combine with Superman to try to do that in the second one. Man of steel should have brought at least a Billion dollars to the Studio, which it did not do, cause people had so many complains. It's so sad for such a superhero.
B001OST0LW|2.0|Money talks, Tim Burton and Michael Keaton walk. And &#34;Batman Forever&#34; (1995) suffers dearly for it. Director Joel Schumacher wastes some fine actors by resurrecting the colorful camp of the 1966-68 TV series. The result is cinematic kitsch on a grand scale — a tremendous decline after the Burton films. Commerce defeats art once again.
B00EVW0VTI|1.0|As I watched this movie it got more far fetched as it went along and basically turned into a B-rated movie.  Save your money!
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|This was a book of life. We all have secrets and wonder the proper times to either tell or not tell. This had good story content and was well written.
B00AIBZLVY|2.0|I knew it had done good at the box office and the buzz was solid - - but this was a movie I was just waiting to end!  The only way I could have given this movie better than a 2 star rating is if Vicki Lawrence popped up as the end as Mama!<br />Jessica Chastain as well as the entire cast did a great job, but the story line got so weak towards the end and when &#34;mama&#34; was finally revealed, you kind of feel cheated.<br />Overall, not a movie I could recommend to anyone or even think about watching again!
B000FA6720|5.0|Amazing story, bittersweet outcome.  To find love like that and have the strength to walk away, I couldn't do it.  I can't.
B00AYB0TOW|3.0|I'll start off by saying, I am a fan of the first Judge Dredd movie.<br /><br />I've never read the comic but I really liked the character and the atmosphere of the Dredd world which I why I chose to watch this one.<br /><br />This is a Reboot of the Judge Dredd world and was more or less a hit or miss of the recreation IMHO.<br /><br />Pros<br /><br />Great atmosphere! You really get a feel of a city in chaos in this movie.<br />Decent characters - They did well with the casting, (I really liked the boss and her story).<br />Good effects - (albeit reused over and over) they still looked cool.<br />Pretty good story/setup - It's the classic one building setup (think Die Hard 1 style). I've seen it before but it doesn't lose points for lack of originality.<br /><br />Cons<br />(Why I titled this More Judge, Less Dredd).<br /><br />Lack of back story - Where is Dredd??? You see him for 90% of the picture but you really don't know anything about him. No flashback, no word of mouth tales, no nostalgic banter between him and his rookie. Heck I ended up caring more about the Main Boss then I did about Dredd and his rookie because they told more about her back story then anyone else. In fact (I'm ashamed to say) while watching it, I actually mistook Dredd for one of the other Judges in one of the scenes because he really doesn't stand out.<br /><br />Less Dread - (this is nit picky but important to my personal experience) to the point above, if you are gonna leave Dredd's back story out and just make him out as a veteran Judge then make him feared as such. There is only one reference to the might of this veteran judge in the movie. I was really hoping they would amp up his legendary status, bad guys should be frozen in fear (heck peeing their pants) when they hear that judge DREDD has entered the vicinity. He is like the famous Batman, striking fear into the hearts of criminals is his primary weapon. Yet while watching the movie I felt he was only experienced but not feared.<br /><br />Inconsistencies (lazy story telling) - the rookie is a mind reader (maybe this was a comic thing that I missed). Okay whatever I'll go with it, she says she doesn't wear her helm (very important while bullets are flying around) because it interferes with her powers. Yet towards the end of the movie guess what she does ... yes she reads the mind of someone wearing the helmet. This could have been easily remedied with a slick ploy to get said person to remove the helm first but ... no, consider the ball dropped.<br /><br />This is supposed to be a lawless world, there is a scene where our cute young rookie gets placed in a perilous situation with numerous murderous thugs with intentions of ravening her. Inexplicably the cold blooded boss (breaks character) has a change of heart and orders them not to touch her. Personally I'm glad because I didn't want that to happen to her but at the same time I'm like don't put her in that position if don't want your film to take that direction. Please understand that \\"You are breaking my IMMERSION.\\" Either this is a lawless immoral land or it's not, don't try to walk the line (again lazy story telling).<br /><br />Less Dredd World - I like the one tower thing, Die hard Throwback. At the same time, this meant sacrificing on a variety of bad guys and scenery. No more mutated cannibalistic scavengers in the \\"cursed earth\\" waste lands, no more freakishly huge robots (ohh i missed them), and was I the only person waiting for him to say \\"double-whammy\\"?. The fact is you get very little feel for the city or the Dredd world at all because of this setup.<br /><br />If this was my first Judge Dredd Movie, I feel like I would have learned nothing about the (main) characters or the important footnotes of Dredd world. Again simple ploys (such as newscaster reports or rumor dialogue) could have filled in this blanks or helped flush out this expansive world that we never get to see.<br /><br />Over hyped slow mo effect - We get it,Matrix made it cool. Now every action movie, video game, and music video has to show the slow mo effect. Dredd introduces a new gimmick drug that allows the user to see things in slow motion. Since they can't react to what they see (which would have been cool) it just becomes a blatant ploy to show slow motion shots every so often (reference lazy story telling).<br /><br />All in all I would rate this 2.5/5 for completely average. It was an average tale about an experienced judge (cop) in an average setting.<br /><br />Worth seeing? Yes if you like action flicks, moments of hyper violence and slow motion sequences.<br /><br />Just expect to see more Judges and less of the world that is Dredd.Matrix made it cool.

B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Good read, very entertaining and clever but it did not scare the **** out of me like the Shining, Salem's Lot or Pet Sematary.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Any smart DVD player is better. I thought it would mirror. Why did Google make such a lame device. They are such technology driven company... this thing is stone age.
B00G32OER4|4.0|Pretty good scare.  Always keeps you on the edge of your seat.  Would recommend for people that love scary movies.
B002ZG99TA|1.0|The movie stops and (freezes)  starts just after the beginning, losing a good 15 minutes or more of scenes. would like to see it replaced with no expense on my end..
B00F91SCXC|1.0|I didn't like it. It made me fall asleep within the first 30 minutes and that doesn't happen with me.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Doesn't t as ke long to get through ten levels because it's not easy to put down once you get started!
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Beautiful story of Victoria, a foster girl who has been bounced around from foster home to foster home and has never been able to put down roots and learn how to love. When she turns 18 and is turned out onto the streets, she goes from being in a group home to being homeless until she meets Renata, a florist who puts her to work on weekends, helping her find her talent and passion.<br /><br />Victoria meets a mysterious stranger who seems to know her, and slowly learns to love. But her fears of destroying those she loves because of a terrible secret from her past has her questioning what she really wants in life and whether there are second chances.<br /><br />This story is about learning to love, learning to let go and forgive, and about change. I loved how everything related to flowers to Victoria. Each flower held meaning and she used them to help others and send messages to those she felt something for—positive or negative. Great story, and poetically written. I want to read it again.
B00E9A656K|4.0|It gets very hard once you have to race the gangs because they have a faster speed that  they can go because we can only go 6 miles per hour and they can go like 8 miles  per hour so it makes it harder for us that's why I rated it 4 STAR.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Just like Simon Birch this book was a total tear jerker! Written very well, I couldn't put it down!  This book makes you establish a connection and really feel for the characters. I highly recommend it and can guarantee you won't be disappointed!  Very quick and easy read.
B0084B5TK8|4.0|Though Bram Stoker devoted a great deal of energy in praising Mina Harker, and the manners are quaint, the values seem refreshing today.  It's a great story that started the huge copycat industry vampire literature has become.  The dialogue and psychological analysis, particularly of Dracula, is interesting.  It was a different time.  The characters seem to throw money around as if everyone was wealthy.
0061122416|5.0|Literally one of the best books I've read in my life. I never have time to write reviews but when I got this e-mail and Amazon wanted me to talk about The Alchemist I JUMPED on it! So many people suggested this book to me and I finally ended up reading. O-M-G! Profound to say the VERY least.<br /><br />Enjoy!
0452282152|1.0|Book arrived and it was missing the first 60 pages.., Not really sure what to do with a book that doesn't have a beginning
B00F35B8F8|2.0|Maybe the drive for big profits took too much out of it for me but I left it kind of cold.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|This was the first time I have read the work of the author. I was tempted to read it by its no.1 New Yorker Bestseller rating. And I must say I have mixed feelings about the work. The story felt forced and it tried too hard to shock and awe its readers - like a Blitzkrieg on disinterested Russia.<br /><br />Literature should be more than making a buck. The style is terse and rushed. I understand this is part of a series and it felt like the author was rushing to complete the trilogy - merely for the sake of it. This felt to me like the Miley Cyrus of literature.<br /><br />However there were parts of it that tempted me to read some of the author's other work. Work which she perhaps felt more passionately about.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|The &quot;free&quot; app only allows you to reach level 35 before you have to buy the rest of it.<br />It is fun to play though.
B009PMEEY2|5.0|I'm addicted to this one.  I love puzzles and this game just sucks me in.  I'm playing # 2 now.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Great characters and very enjoyable plot.  I always enjoy authors attention to detail in location descriptions and the way he pulls me right I to the story as if I am there
B0089Q1TPM|5.0|This is one of Mel Brooks' fabulous parody movies.  The whole family just loves this movie, including my 13-yr-old daughter.  My hubby and I can quote this movie by heart!  If you want a serious, sci-fi movie, you will not find it in this.  However, if you want an irreverent, comedy that plays off of blockbuster movies, then you should love this movie!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Does what it is suppose to do.<br />Roll Freely In the Hand & In the bed.<br />Really ...ok...we done yet.
B0025KW29U|4.0|This was bought for my hubby as a Christmas present.  He loves the movie and can watch it repeatedly.  I thought it was nice, but it was for him.  Nathan Fillion is great in this movie as is Neal Patrick Harris. (Dougie Houser, MD himself! :-)  )  It's a musical, satirical comedy.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|BEST BOOK EVER!<br />It seriously only took me 2 days to read this I couldn't put it down it is the perfect mix of &#34;smut&#34; and romance and comedy I recommend this book to any lady!
B004G6009U|5.0|My daughter and I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!  Pascal and Maximus are our fav characters.  We are torn as to which one we love more.  There is plenty of humor throughout the movie to keep you entertained similar to what you find in Toy Story.  If you enjoy animated movies, you will like this one.  We watched this so many times when it was on Netflix Instant Streaming.  Once it was taken off of Netflix streaming, we decided we just had to buy it because we missed watching it.
B003B02O0A|5.0|From the moment you start reading this book, it is torture to put it down. I resented any interruption while reading this novel. Could not put it down until finished!  Like all of Grisham's books, it is well written and artfully thought out and planned. I can hardly wait to read Sycamore Row which perhaps resembles a sequel to A Time to Kill.
B00FWLSLJ4|4.0|I loved this movie!  It contains hints of Godzilla , Transformers, Avatar and a few others which makes for a sci-fi lovers taste treat.
B009F1DIOK|5.0|This is a must watch movie for all! All of the Lord of the ring movies are great and a must see!!!
B00FOWX6NM|1.0|Very low quality. Not a crystal clear, it is a ordinary plastic. Don't recommend for the price. Looks good in the picture.
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|It's pretty cool because it's got a timer and you can edit your pics straight from the app. I think it's pretty rad
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It is a very addictive game.  I am so glad it is available for the kindle.  I love this game.
B00A6CCF0K|1.0|After &#34;The Shining&#34; I expected a scary, fun ride with &#34;Dr. Sleep.&#34; Didn't get it. I love Stephen King but this book was a huge disappointment to me. It was not scary and the story was actually boring. The characters were likable but as I was reading I kept thinking, &#34;it'll get better, it'll get better&#34; but it never did.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I like this game because it gives you challenges and you can win whatever is therefore you to win and open.
B00B19H2KU|2.0|I'm not sure why, other than marketing, this movie was touted as being based on a true story. I've read the story of the dibbuk box (it's easy to find online) and that would have made a fine, creepy movie that perhaps someone will make someday. What we're left with is the tale of a young girl who doesn't know how to act, who happens to own a old wooden box.<br /><br />If you've seen the trailers, you've likely seen the single scene in the entire movie that isn't a complete cliche - the girl, looking into the mirror, sees two fingers reaching up out of her throat. If you could somehow just focus on that image for two hours, you'll have had a more satisfying viewing experience than actually seeing the movie. Mostly, it's just a movie that desperately wants to be The Exorcist (seriously, there's even an MRI scene), but fails at even that, nevermind being a functional and enjoyable movie that can stand on its own.<br /><br />I'm being charitable giving even two stars, and it earns that second one just for casting Hasidic Jewish reggae artist Matisyahu as...well, a Hasidic Jewish exorcist. Unlike so many bad horror movies, this one didn't even manage to solicit laughter from me. Mostly I just felt sorry for everyone involved.
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|It keep asking me to spend money to move on in the game. Or it would make me wait minutes to be able yo play on.. I was hoping it was more like Candy Swipe.
B00006CXSS|5.0|But I ordered it USED.  I saved money, was only $15 for the set.  Discs were in good condition and the tin was clean.  The series is still amazing after all these  years.  For those that haven't seen it, get it.  It'll tear you up.  It's that good.
1457514508|4.0|Good book for a first time author! Lots of twists in the plot. Kept me guessing until the end....  I would buy this book again!
B004WO57E4|5.0|This collection took me back to a simpler time in life.  I still remember how many sleepless nights because of the first Heroes of Might & Magic game.<br /><br />This collection has all the expansions included and the games runs smoothly on my PC (windows 7).
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|It's fun an lively, fast paced wish it loaded faster but it's worth the slow load for all the fun.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|A well crafted legally correct case involving a holographic (hand written) will set in rural Mississippi  in 1988 with the original attorney who starred in a Time to kill most probably the best of the author's work. The author clearly understands the mechanics of civil litigation, the pressures and thrills of being a trial lawyer. As a retired former trial lawyer most of the legal scene ring true to me. When evidence is let in by the judge in what appears to be legal error, you know that the court may well have erred. I like the small town, it's legal practice and the fact the times were changing slowly for blacks & whites in this bastion of racism.<br /><br />Grisham knows how to lay out a an exciting and thrilling story of why and how a rich man gives almost all  his money at the last moment to his black servant who tended him through his years as he was dying from cancer. The history of slavery & lynching  which poisoned the Deep South is dealt with artfully. I expect to see sequels to this book relating to Jake the lead character a clever and honorable trial lawyer.
B008OOYALE|5.0|Fun game with building your dragon island. I like the non- competitive nature of the game. Would recommend this game to anyone.
B00G32OER4|5.0|The scariest movie Ive seen in years!!!!<br /><br />At one point, we jumped right off the couch!!!  Don't watch it before you go to bed!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This Stephen King story really held your interest. It made you want to know more and it and made you think...what if.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I read Divergent and Insurgent several times in anticipation of Allegiant.  I cannot express the disappointment I felt after reading Allegiant.  I deal with enough loss and injustice in reality. I do not read fiction books for more of the same. Veronica Roth is a gifted writer.  I found myself personally connected to the characters she created.  Because of this I will not read anything else she writes.  If I could give this book a negative star rating I would.
B00EK0UBPU|5.0|Best book I've read in ages! Well deserving of the Booker.  Don't let the large number of characters introduced in the first couple of chapters put you off - it all becomes clear.
B00F35B8F8|4.0|A worthy addition to the franchise. And unless they go back to high school maybe the last, until Deep Space 9?????
B002VISNBC|5.0|The Twits are very mean and nasty. They deserve what happens to them in the end. This story is great for children from six to twenty.
B00ARN0ZF0|3.0|I think it's actually slightly better than the others. You still have to just ignore certain things about why the heck they're recording everything, but at least no one is screaming to turn it off constantly, nor is mostly watching people sleep. There's a couple cool special f/x if you're into that. That's pretty much all you need to know if you made it this far.
B00992CF6W|1.0|I mean it's fun at first but once you've got a lot of diamonds and gold it gets boring then when you've built the ultimate house you get bored but you should get blockheads
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|Good game, fun to play and a good time killer. Short game more levels needed. I got for free so it was worth it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love to play this game. It's fun, all be it addictive. When I want to relax, I'll play and see how many levels I can get through. This is the original Candy Crush Saga, not a poor imitation.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|Amazon's price is the best I've found for the TV passes on the web.<br />I absolutely love that TV passes are offered as I don't have cable (don't want it either!) and I find this to be an affordable and easy option to watch the shows I love.<br /><br />The new season of the Walking Dead is shaping up to be my favourite so far. Can't believe how complex the characters are and how the story is developing. Can't wait to see how the season pans out!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Best game ever, very addictive. So excited when it became available for my Kindle, have it on my iPhone/iPad glad I am able to sync between all.
B00389XV42|5.0|Chuck is one of the best shows ever and should be revived.  Come back Chuck!  Your fans miss you deeply!
B001RTSPVY|5.0|This is the best show on television. I wish I could be lobotomized just so I could watch this for the first time again!
B00AA0TZTW|4.0|However, some track lack polish and it is apparent why Jimi didn't release them. Still if you love Seattle Music/Jimi/Guitars, you won't be disappointed.
0345347951|5.0|Really interesting book. This was chosen as a read for our mythology class and it is a good read. Same author as 2001: Space Odyssey. Pick it up if your looking for some sci-fi fiction.
1401242855|5.0|Without giving any of the story away, this is your prototypical detective thriller. Batman must come to grips with the fact that he may not know his city as well as he believes. Twist and turns abound, you never know what's around the next corner, and Synder keeps you on the edge of your seat. Capullo's art brings Synder's words to life and in perhaps the ultimate compliment to a comic book artist, each frame paints Snyder's story--with or without words.<br /><br />As for the Mask, it's flimsy and I thought it would be thicker, but what can you do... It stays in the box anyhow.
B0058YPG1G|5.0|They keep getting better and better. The storytellers of this series will keep you on the edge till the last shot.
B00C9U9YOW|5.0|This is a new direction for QOTSA. This dark, emotional charged, and deeply personal album is not normal territory for the band, but that is what a brush with death can do to a lyricist. However, if you fear that this new direction is going to take away from the traditional Queens sound, lay them to rest. This album oozes everything Josh Homme, and has a very distinct QOTSA vibe.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|it's a great game. i'm really glad it finally came out for the kindle. it's about time. couldn't be happier.
B00B1ME3DQ|5.0|I am going to miss the dark, grungy, blues road Clutch traveled down, but if this is what they are planning on replacing it with, I think I'll be alright.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Make sure you understand what you are getting. It's a device that lets you &#34;mirror&#34; your device to your TV and it's restricted to the Chrome browser and some apps (like YouTube and Netflix).<br /><br />The experience is decent, the quality is great, but after you get it it just lets you wonder, do I really need this?
1476727651|5.0|Great story line well written to keep your interest---very suspenceful---- hard to put down---best he's written in quite  a while
B004GJDQT8|5.0|I can pretty much do everything on the mobile app, and it's extremely useful when window shopping books in brick-and-mortar shops because I can scan books and get an idea if I should buy or order online on the spot.
B004XMMSZG|5.0|I ordered this specifically to connect my iPhone to a Bose SoundDock.  I've been using for a month and it has worked perfectly so far.
B007SGM084|1.0|Promises dark intriguing erotica and relationship and she tuirns him vanilla. Author repeats the same silly phrases ad nauseum.Only the outsider characters created any real danger or excitement. How can it be a movie?<br /><br />?
B003G4W49C|5.0|This was an intellectual story that was not only a smooth read but a great read.  You can feel Ender's pain and can completely relate to his plight.  As a mom I just wanted to scoop Ender up into my arms to protect him, keep him safe from the buggers, but more especially from those who brought out both the best and the worst of him. Yet at the same time I admire his intellect and all that he accomplished.  I look forward to continuing his adventures.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This is by far the best app I have ever played. I would recommend this to anyone who loves a challenge.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love ice age village it is so fun. It is cool interesting and entertaining. I recommend this app to all ages and genders
B00E7RZEI0|5.0|Fun game would recommend if you like water type puzzles. Good puzzles but not too hard and I like the water effects of the game.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Love how easy it is to set up and use! Easy on the pocketbook too! I plan on purchases a few for Christmas Gifts.
B00AB7HESI|3.0|The first time I played this game it was awesome then it got boring and boring. I would not buy it if I were you.<br /><br />.
0385349947|3.0|I'm 20 years old, was born in a third world country, and grew up in a single mother household. However, I knew a lot of these things. Growing up around a lot of strong females has not taught me that women are equal to men, in fact it's taught me that women are better than men. Therefore, a lot of this book didn't resonate with me because these were concepts I thought every woman should know. Being nice only gets you so far and having children doesn't mean that you have to give up a career. If you're born into a different sort of situation than I guess you might need this book but I feel that my generation (I'm currently at college at Cornell University) should already know these things and should be working hard to put these ideas into play. At least that's what I'm going to do
0785153942|3.0|This is all right. I stil haven't read it all the way because I wasn't a fan of the art. I guess I should get the movie novel. It talks about a lot of stuff, like who Eldris's partner was and why his nose was bleeding in the movie...<br /><br />Yeah this should be a continuing series....
B003O86FMW|5.0|Best book ever I am starting to think I need to buy the 3rd book I can't Waite until the movie comes out!!!!
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|This is a wonderful asset to anyone who wants to create on the Kindle or tablet.  I use Office 2010 at home and am delighted to have found one that is available for my Kindle.
B00ECUARO8|3.0|Started out an intriguing mystery but became a kind of stock story. Worth seeing but not memorable. Good for kids.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|it would not let me bring over the level I'm on playing on my phone and computer ..wish it was a way of getting it though Facebook on the kindle
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Pros: I like the ease of streaming media from any of my mobile devices without having to connect the device to the television via a cable.<br />Con: other than when using netflix or youtube apps, the chromecast only works via google chrome.
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|A wonderful and inspiring story This book and Malala's story are are truly inspiring and reminds me to be thankful for the education I've received.
B009ZXT4BY|4.0|I like it but like the other people it does need more time to play and should let u play until u don't want to
B006885LZM|5.0|BASED ON TWO OF THE ALL TIME BEST FIRSTHAND WAR ACCOUNTS TO COME OUT OF WWII,  ROBERT LEIKE (spelling) &#34;Helmet for my Pillow&#34; and E.B. Sledge's &#34;With the Old Breed&#34;.  VERY REALISTIC THAT SHOW THE HORROR OF WAR.  DOES NOT MAKE IT GLAMOROUS.  THE BEST WAR MOVIE I HAVE SEEN.
B00BC24NT4|3.0|The major impression I was left with is that this must read very differently to British vs. American audiences. The novel (no spoiler here) is about a botched counter-terrorist operation and the subsequent coverup, and Le Carre deftly brings the characters involved together and the drama to a fever pitch. The stakes seem very high to those involved and presumably to the average British reader, but as an American my first thought is that given the Iraq and Afghanistan wars and all the special forces and drone operations in places like Yemen and Somalia, we probably generate a dozen or so similar incidents a year, and the Pentagon does not even bother covering them up since the American public really does not seem to care or be shocked.<br /><br />I am glad that Le Carre is not cynical (although he is incisively critical of the Bush-Blair-mercenary-contractor apparatus) but there is still a part of me that says, &#34;311 pages for *that*?&#34;
B0091WNK8M|4.0|Very good family movie enjoyed it never was able to watch the whole thing was very good movie on very funny and very down to earth
B000WYCF6Q|5.0|I've now bought three of these, and they just work well.  Having a mirror makes a big difference, riding in traffic.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love the different levels and the complexities of the levels as you advance. Playing with my friends is competitive.
B00FPH3YQA|2.0|I had hopes that this would be better than part 2 which was a disappointment. This movie should have been titled 'Alan and Chow' as it took these two characters and focused almost exclusively. The dialog for Bradley Cooper's character was very limited except for dropping the F-bomb occasionally. It got to the point where characters that I had enjoyed seeing became annoying. There were a few laughs however I laughed the most during the credits with the end scene. Overall a real disappointment.
B00DQC2FPM|4.0|PROS:<br />- Fun to build<br />- Minifigs look amazing, Doc Brown has two faces<br />- Detailed set<br /><br />CONS:<br />- Doors are flimsy<br /><br />I think you get a lot of bang for your bucks here. Doc Brown and Marty plus you can change the build of the deLorean to whatever movie version you want.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Of all the books, my favorite is still the first. However, this last installment does a good job of tying up most of the loose ends from book two.  The only thing I had hoped for was a bit more interaction between Salander and Blomkvist. However, I can see that it would not fit very well into this book's plot.
B002VHI8J0|4.0|Any serious sci-fi reader will enjoy this book, clever and coherent in its flitting between time, people and their interconnections.<br />Very enjoyable reading.
B00F8MI9NK|5.0|Fun movie for the kids!  The picture looks great on our computer, too!  We have it on our instant videos and Amazon Unbox, too.
B005J9ZDYK|5.0|This is a great DVD set. There are TONS/TONNES of great episodes (40!!!) and lotsa bonus bits on the two DVDs, so it'll take you several nights of viewing to get through this entire Season 2 compilation. Here's what you get:<br /><br />Double Trouble<br />Draw The Line<br />Sheepless Nights<br />Spring Lamb<br />Strictly No Dancing<br />Who's The Caddy?<br />Hair Today, Gone Tomorrow<br />Bagpipe Buddy<br />Supersize Timmy<br />Lock Out<br />Cheetah Cheater<br />Ewe've Been Framed<br />Bitzer's New Hat<br />Hide & Squeak<br />Frantic Romantic<br />Everything Must Go<br />Party Animals<br />Cat Got Your Brain?<br />In The Doghouse<br />Two's Company<br />The Boat<br />What's Up Dog?<br />Cock-a-Doodle Shaun<br />Bitzer's Basic Training<br />Chip Off The Old Block<br />Pig Trouble<br />Bitzer From The Black Lagoon<br />Zebra Ducks...<br />Whistle Blower<br />The Big Chase<br />The Magpie<br />Operation Pidsley<br />Pig Swill Fly<br />Shirley Whirley<br />Foxy Laddie<br />Shaun Goes Potty<br />An Ill Wind<br />Fireside Favorite<br />Snowed In<br />We Wish Ewe a Merry Christmas<br /><br />All that, plus two games, four video shorts (+ a &#34;making of&#34; short), a behind the scenes gallery, and the usual trailers. Whew! Most of the episodes are good-to-great, but be prepared for a change in tone and appearance from that of Season 1. I won't give spoilers here, but the &#34;changes&#34; were NOT all that off-putting, IMHO. So... it's ALL here in this DVD. Check my list of contents BEFORE buying other DVDs. You'll save money and avoid disappointment.
B000035Z3K|4.0|The classic Universal horror film featuring the most famous vampire in all of fiction suffers from the same structural problem as the novel that inspired it—fantastic beginning, but it’s all downhill from there.  The set design of Castle Dracula, expertly photographed by Karl Fruend, is wonderfully creepy, as is the Carfax Abbey set later in the film.  Once the action shifts to London, however, the script’s reliance on the stage play rather than the novel reveals itself in a stagy presentation with characters entering and exiting rooms as required to report on events in the world outside.  Time has not been kind to Bela Lugosi’s performance, which seems a little campy to modern eyes, but that is not his fault.  Rather, it is a credit to him that his portrayal was powerful and unique enough to inspire generations of imitators and impressionists.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Challenging and fun. My 9 year old neice loved this game and required minimum assistance to complete early floors. we haven't made it to later floors yet
B008K4JDLA|5.0|As always, I got excited about chris Anderson's book. I enjoy the enthusiasm he shows - we don't always need to dwell on the challenges but need a bright future to be painted.<br /><br />Regarding the contents of this one, the maker movement fascinates me. The book starts with motivation and ends with concrete toolset for starting to make stuff. The motivation part contains both well-written stories and references to earlier studies. You get ar explained that with the emerging tools and business models manufacturing can move back from low-cost countroes to wherever innovation happens. You will also get loads of one-liners to fill your elevator speech on maker movement.<br /><br />The toolset offered gives you a starting point. Your ambition determines if you daydream, make something that supports or becomes a hobby, or even make something that becomes a real business. <br /><br />I recommend this book to anyone wondering what is the fuss with 3D printing.
B00FPH6AXE|4.0|Will Smith foundations are remarkable. He want to see his son succeed as well. It's not the movie, it's the insight what is important. I was hoping for a little more quality effects! Great idea, average execution.
B008J2GAKU|1.0|I can not read the text. I am using a Kindle fire hd and I am unable to read the text. I am unable to zoom into the page so I cannot read the text. The text is so small I am unable to read the text on the page. Shame on Amazon for promoting this product.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|What. Just. Happened. Such an amazing book. I stayed up all night because I just had to finish it. Veronica carries this wonderful story out until the end. The end of the trilogy, I think, shows that Tobias will never ever forget Tris. It's going to take me a while to get over this one!
B003G4W49C|5.0|This book was so good that fete reading it one time 2 years ago, I had to read it again and see the movie premier. This is my favorite book and I consider myself a bit of a picky reader. Great plot. Fast moving. Smooth. Understandable, yet complex and entertaining. I couldn't put it down?
B00DL2W7Q4|5.0|This book compelled me to rethink the way i look at situations. There is more than what appears on the surface.
B006KX3GXO|4.0|I am new to this app but so far it has been easy with lots of options-still learning it--anxious to use it more
B00E9ZFIMM|4.0|very useful. Let's me keep up with info I need.I can write additional information and keep it in a palce were I can easily find it.
B00F3W9NQ2|5.0|WoW.... Gets better and better!  I'm ready to see Bonnie come back to life!  Y'all Know it's coming!!  Ready for next season!
B00H83EUQW|4.0|I found the film boring. Sure the view was stunning. Great sets. Great actors. But seriously, what did you expect would happen after disaster struck? One of two things were going to happen: Either they were going to survive or they won't. The film is consumed with us getting to that point. Sandra Bullock in a space suit reading a tech manual trying to figure out what button to push. Real? Authentic? Sure, but so was my yawn.<br /><br />The visual effects are great on the big screen. I will be honest. I despise films which consist of one person being trapped and having to survive the whole film, because I know one of two things are going to happen...<br /><br />What the film really needed was a big rubber headed alien to save them and probe their privates.Sure, I would have complained about that too, but at least I would have stayed awake.<br /><br />BTW I loved 2001 because it mentally engaged me. This one did not because I knew one of two things were going to happen...<br /><br />Parental Guide: Bullock lets loose one early F-bomb after a few S***s didn't suffice. 3 1/2 stars for Bullock in shorts. What did I do with my copy of &#34;Fire on the Amazon?&#34;
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This is the first SK novel I have liked in many years.  It reminds me of his writing before he got off track with all the ultra stupid garbage.
B005LY4B0A|5.0|A simple game to play, but still lots of fun.  The higher levels are a good challenge.  I would recommend this game for all ages.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|Such a disappointment.  I loved the first two and was so excited to read this book, but this book left me feeling depressed and sad.  I read this genre for an escape.  I love the excitement and the challenges and the anticipation of what comes next, but this book ended this series in such a sad a and disappointing way.  In some ways, as it was reading it, the ending was predictable but I kept hoping for the best.  Such a shame.  I wish I hadn't read it.
B00EAH3EQG|5.0|Natalia came through with Jeff Bhasker and made an AMAZING POP ALBUM! Very surprised with how much I love this album and was very satisfied with the relatively cheap cd (and decent packaging for a jewel case).
B003G4W49C|5.0|Very original take on the alien invasion theme.  I enjoyed re-reading right after reading Ender's Shadow (also great book).  The book is WAY better than the movie. EDIT: I did enjoy the movie, so if you liked the movie, you will likely love the book.  For a book written in 1985, I am amazed how modern it still feels.
B00EY7LT9Q|5.0|I have to admit when I saw the first couple of shows I was not impressed, I thought it was hokey! and would get canceled soon, but I soon became hooked on the show and the characters, I am a big fan now!
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|Love,love this game. Don't want to quit. Great fun playing with people all over the universe! Loved the card game and love the online version 're.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|I play this game a lot on my computer and my tablet and enjoy it,I just play it about twice a day. The reason I rated low is because I got it from Amazon to use on my reader but it does not work. If you get the game, get it for a tablet or computer or even a phone but not for a reader.
B007FTZDN8|5.0|I am addicted to TED Talks, bravo!!!  These talks will make you cry, laugh and think about the people in this world in a different way!!
B00AA7V2Z0|5.0|This show is awesome. Definitely not expecting all the twists and turns. Love scary movies and this tv show is scarier than most films.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Very fun and addicting! If I get stuck on a level I can't not keep trying, over and over. I wish more of my friends played so I could get more lives! :)
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|great way to pass some time in a fun entertaining way.my new obsession so glad I found this new app
B006LR0XLM|5.0|just love it,  Absolutely amazing and it is so very easy to use.  Now I can access all my pictures on all my devices.
B00006HYQ5|5.0|A great mouse for small hands.  I have small hands (I wear a size 2 wedding band), so this is the best mouse all around.  My husband already has one for when he travels, and he let me use it when the mouse for my desk top died.  It was so great that I threated to keep it until he bought me one of my own.
B005LAII62|4.0|What an enjoyable, colorful, well made animated feature. Forget that the story has merit in that it encourages tolerance ... that's just gravy; this film is a winner through and through because it is pure fun. It's got comedy, solid characters, creepy zombies, charming voice work, and wonderful compositions/lighting/cinematography.
B0066WJLU6|4.0|I like turning on flashlight when I need it.  But would b nice if I could turn it on with out logging into my phone
B00G32TD98|2.0|The trailers far exceeded the film. A waste of time.<br />We kept hoping it would improve. Alas,  it deteriorated, or should I say, decomposed.
B00338QF0U|4.0|A complex bit of intrigue as chance sets off a troubling sequence of events that loosely connect a small group of characters around the central figure, unaware of their mutual relationships. A life lesson in how small seemingly insignificant choices can affect many lives. The choices have the reader constantly asking the &#34;what if&#34; question till the very end...and beyond.
B001H1SVO8|4.0|A current-day classic!<br /><br />Remember the old days when a movie ended and the audience clapped? Fight Club leaves you wanting to clap - to spend the rest of your night telling people what a great movie it was.
B009VA1FN6|4.0|This is my first book I have read of Kate Morton. What a lovely and easy read.<br />You need to enjoy going back to the past to relive moments that keep this story interesting.<br />This technique is tricky but Kate has mastered this without loosing the storyline or the characters involved.<br />Can't help but buy another book of hers for another good read.<br />Thanks Kate Morton
B00FPH51LQ|3.0|It was an entertaining movie with decent laughs and a few poignant moments.  It makes heavy use of CGI, some of it even believable.  Most of the CGI looks like a video game, though.  IMHO, it does distract from the story, if only because I am a techie and expect more from Hollywood.<br /><br />The story is cute, if very predictable.  If you have seen MIB and Ghost, you pretty much can write the movie yourself and come very close.  That said, it was an entertaining movie, I just hope they get writers with better imaginations if they decide to do a sequel.
B008F5Y7UQ|5.0|The story line is intrequing, witty and captures real live dilemas in a perspective allowing perceptual clarity.  It addresses the institution of marrige and the depth of committment and love in a fashion that demonstrates what the true value of the intersection.
B00DQC2FPM|5.0|Very nice - rare- hard to find in stores- Our granson loves this movie and this will be a great birthday gift for him!
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|Great fun. And free! With a free scratch card for free tokens every forty five ministers. Play with friends and enjoy!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I would give it a higher rating if I could!! I couldn't put it down. I bought the audible and the ebook so I could read some and listen when I couldn't read. Its a good thing I did! I didn't even sleep!! I can;t wait to get started on the next book.
B004LWZW24|3.0|The first 2/3 of this movie were amazingly creepy and effective.  I'm way too old and have seen way too many horror movies to have been as thoroughly creeped out as I was during the first hour or so of this movie.  Then the wheels fall of the bus as a medium shows up to explain everything away and set up the ludicrous 'rescue' which is filmed with so little lighting you'll be frequently wondering whether or not your TV display has gone on the blink.  The final act was frustrating and annoying which was a complete shame.  5 stars for the first 2/3.  0 stars for the last 1/3 for a total score of 3.33 out of 5
B007BVMVDU|3.0|Great show but I watched it streaming from amazon through my roku, and everything was fine until about 3/4 into the show and all of a sudden it stopped streaming. My internet was running fine 18 mbps download according to speedtest so I assume it was a problem with amazon. It finally barely started working but only on the lowest resolution
B00973DDN2|5.0|When I chose to buy the album I thought a couple of the songs were pretty good but I didn't care too much for some of the others, but I mainly only bought it because it was $4.  That was 4 of the best dollars I've spent in a while.  Having listened to the album on repeat for a couple days trying to get into the music and not regret buying the album, I fell in love.  There is such passion and energy on all of the songs and I love singing along to them when I'm driving in my car.  I think my favorites would have to be: Be Still, Flesh and Bone, The Way It Was, and all of the other songs, basically.  I am a recent Killers fan but I have this album, Day & Age, and Hot Fuss and I think I would have to say this is my favorite album of the three (although I have spent more time listening to this one).
B001GXTXTO|5.0|Have almost all of their albums, I don't get tired of their sound.<br />The current best blues rock music! They combine old and new with unique style of their own.
B008Y6WMEY|3.0|Classic Kubrick. Somewhat unpolished but definitely fun. Characters could have used more development.  A colorized version would be a nice edition.
B009XI7RF6|5.0|Try to get all 3 stars and is pretty fun! 5 stars in my book. This is the first app I wanted to rate.
1401938906|5.0|I LOVE this book!!  It has opened my mind.  Actually, it continues to blow my mind, with each experiment that I complete. This is the book you've been looking for.  Buy it, you won't be sorry.
B00APJLY0Q|5.0|This movie was genuinely funny (for adults), and not just cute or silly for kids.  That's the end of my review, but since this review is making me write &#34;7 more words,&#34; it is entertaining for both parents and kids.
B000ZHS3E8|2.0|Extremely Bad Moving, Bad sound Bad Video Constantly Jumps Forward.  Regret buying. Not worth the money.  Terrible Terrible Terrible Terrible Terrible
B005AERS74|5.0|Ive been listening to a lot of Rock latley my cousin inttoduced me to this band and their good love rocking out to this
B00280LYHS|5.0|A very good book<br />The characters and the setting was really good characters in the story like Grover under wood ate allot of tin cans but the best scene of the story was when all the camera had to sacrifice themselves in order to save mount Olympus and new York city also to fight the titan Kronos.
B00G32VYDG|4.0|Not bad great special effects knockoff of men black I think but not too thick just a thin version of a knockoff
1936608898|5.0|I perform aerially for a living and run half marathons for fun, and I've always struggled to keep belly bloat off. I was embarrassed at my gut-tummy, and my performances suffered as I tried to \\"suck it in,\\" stand in unnatural postures, leave out unflattering stunts, or hide from my figure. I ate a mostly-vegetarian diet with appropriate calories, fat, and so on. Nothing worked. I finally discovered I couldn't have gluten a few years back, which made me feel great to eliminate. A friend suggested this book to complement my GF diet, and after just three weeks now, I have NO bloat, and I'm back to looking lean and making twice as much money. For the first time in five years, I had a performance where I didn't think about \\"sucking in\\" and I finally -- FINALLY -- felt confident enough to perform at my best. I could go on and on. I feel better, and have no trouble at all turning down candy, sweets, dips, chips, alcoholic drinks, or any of my other old cravings because they just don't sound very tasty anymore (I beat the sugar dragon!). I'm not hungry between meals, I'm satisfied with what I'm eating and how much, and even my enormous grocery bill was cut in half. I don't know why I never thought about or learned how to build my plate and what to put on it and in what portions, but, just that simple tool has given me real structure I lacked in meal planning. Thank you for this book!
034580404X|1.0|It's very badly written and incredibly stupid. The only reason it became famous was because of the eroticism of the sex scenes. Basically, it's like a cheap porn movie--no plot, no story, lousy acting, just sex.
B0058PJ6NE|3.0|Waiting for an update to fix glitches on the playlist plays one item then freezes up.  Works great at downloading but doesn't recognise items downloadedon the free version.
B005LLSZNM|5.0|Great show!!  I love the constant struggle of the bad guys trying to do the right thing while maintaining their outlaw image.
B00EGMQIJ0|2.0|&#34;The Circle&#34; has had several good reviews and a lot of advertising, and I've read one good book, &#34;Zeitoun&#34; by Dave Eggers in the past, so I was looking forward to an insightful, well-written novel about our current show-all, tell-all internet culture. I was more than deeply disappointed. &#34;The Circle&#34; is so bad that I had a lot of trouble finishing it. Having finished it, I feel that I wasted my time.<br /><br />People who have read one or two reviews will know all there is to know about the plot, and there *is* a plot. There's also a valuable message available in the book, which is the only reason to give it more than one star, or zero stars. This is merely a lazy, sloppy, very shallow attempt to &#34;monetize&#34; the author's lack of respect for his readers. There's no depth, no character development, no subtlety, no new insight into the structure of the Facebook-Twitter-Google cultural takeover. That's too bad. I'm afraid the book is so bad that readers won't be moved by it at all. I know I wasn't.<br />But the author is no doubt laughing at us all, all the way to the bank.
B00BG08FKK|5.0|Such a great CD!  You're totally able to picture the movie in your mind as you listen to the songs.  Beautifully done.
B00APJLY0Q|5.0|This was such a cute tmovie to show my class for Halloween.  It was entertaining for both children and adults!
159315724X|5.0|Great book for the entry level or die hard self developer. Easy to implement strategies to start achieving the results you are striving toward.
B0092G1O8A|5.0|a perfect follow-up to the novel in my classroom. We can't wait to see the second movie next in late November!
1416583408|5.0|Author is dog lover, but keeps her independence and basically observes dogs with no human beings around.  Uses OmmVeldt (Self-World) as model.  You will learn much about dog \\"thinking\\" in this book.  Definitely worth the read.
B0091W7MP4|5.0|An oldie but goodie. I love this film because it stars some of my favorite actors including Sigourney Weaver, Holly Hunter and Dermot Mulroney. It's creepy, creative and definitely a nail-biter! Definitely recommend if you're into psychological thrillers and are interested in a minimal amount of blood and guts. Good plot, good editing and great cast.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I like how it answered all my questions from book one.....book three here I come, can't wait for the movie to come out
B00FWLDHSY|4.0|Great sci-fi action flick!  Some of the dialogue is a little contrived and predictable, however, if you're looking for a full charged, ready to rumble war of the the mechs vs. hideous alien dudes--this is it!
0307719219|5.0|Excellent book. Easy to read. Some historical error but it is not a history book. Trows additional concepts to the complex equation on why nations fail.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Love the built in timer. It doesn't feed my addition. Don't like the request for pennies to aid in advancing.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|The puzzles are not easy, but they are fair. The hints are helpful but don't give away the solution. Reminds me of the Myst games.
B00FVVR2ZO|2.0|NO Sign of ANY Updates for Kindle! I can't add friends, PLEASE FIX!  More stars when I am caught up to Android & 0is
B005CAPS0K|3.0|Somewhat predictable, felt like we'd seen this before in a \\"been there done that\\" kind of way. Not even close to bring the thrills and chills of The Conjuring.
B00G32TD98|5.0|OMG DON'T WATCH IT ALONE !!!!! This has to be the most scariest movie ever trust me it will make you scream and jump a lot of time
1476727651|5.0|Bought for my wife as an early xmas present.  She is a King fanatic and we have 4 bokshelves of Stephen King books.  I think she owns ALL of them....or at least now!!
B003H4I4JU|1.0|Not nearly as good as the first book. It was confusing and boring and you will put it down ten seconds after you start it
B000OT8GCQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. It made me smile and it made me cry. Kept me wondering how it would end. Would he ended  up lonely or if Savannah would somehow come back to him. The ending was appropriate to the story.
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|Fun game for all ages. Surprised at how addicting it has turned out to be. Go ahead and try it for yourself.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I enjoy the game so far, no need to spend money. Nice graphics and many different games and goals to compete.
B001RUXW48|5.0|One of these movie I came across so far, I watch it repeatedly n still wasn't bored, that I went and purchase it
B000YMDQQ4|5.0|This is a great book. Everyone should read all of Neil Gaiman's books. You may also enjoy &#34;The Graveyard Book&#34;
B005EWDA9M|5.0|I haven't expected so interesting and great story. Two stories about two main characters influence each other and keep us reading till our eyes hurt because we want to know what happened to both of them...  The plot is so catchy and new that no one will be disappointed.
B00B2QG3K2|3.0|I really love Still Into You so I thought I'd go ahead and buy it even though I've never bought a Paramore album. I've always sort of liked some of their songs but never enough to buy an album and I guess now I'm realizing why. I personally would give it less than three stars but I'm trying to be fair since I'm sure there are many who will love it. I just hate feeling a little disappointed with my music purchases and that's what I'm feeling right now as I eject it from my CD player.
B00CWQAFT6|5.0|A great band with a phenomenal female singer. If you like Dio Iron maiden or Man o War odds you will like this album.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|This game is a must have  I love that it's all ways getting updates  it is so much fun<br />I love that you can get special agents you should have it
B000VIK8D0|5.0|It was delivered quickly and came as described. If you like Costner be sure to watch this - it is<br />a great portrayal of Wyatt Earp
B00992CF6W|5.0|fun its really creative i just cant wait till the newer updates keep it up Mojang :D p.s bla bla bla i just did tht for the words required
B00FR0V264|5.0|This 2 disc set was enough for me & despite what Van says this album & a few of this others are in desperate need of the Deluxe Edition upgrade. If you don't already own this classic you're in for a treat...pour a nice drink...relax & soak it all in!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is very fun, challenging, and colourful c:<br />I recommend it to anyone who needs something to do in their free time cx
B000P0J024|5.0|One of the best video tracks ever with George Harrison in the lead, then joined by Roy Orbison with Bob Dylan and Tom Petty coming in on the chorus, all rounded out by Jeff Lynne.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|Helps me compensate for a flaky power connector. With Battery HD, I can wiggle the cord until I see the connection icon, then leave it until the morning. My Kindle Fire would be useless without it!
B009XI7RF6|4.0|If you go into it thinking it's going to be easy, think again...It starts off all nice and comfy, lulling you into a false sense of security. Just when you think &quot;This isn't so bad...don't know what that dizzy reviewer was talking about...&quot; BAM!! The game starts to change...the soft melody stays the same, it looks the same. But now it's got teeth and isn't gently guiding you anymore...now it's taunting you. Daring you to prove your mettle, challenging you to find a way to make the colors work and not RUN OUT OF INK!!<br />Yeah, I'm actually having a lot of fun with it! You will too... Didn't see any real disturbing permissions...a few strange but not scary. And having it as 'Free App o' the Day' just makes it that much sweeter... I'd give it a solid 4.5 stars...
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|It adds different gameplay too separate it from the other jewel games. I'm definitely getting the next version when it's released.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have been waiting so long for this game to be on my tablet. Wait until you play it ! It may be the best game EVER!
B00F91RYL8|2.0|boring at times. Zombies is not my thing and had I known I would have passed on this one. I guess that's what the Z is for LOL
B008YW5RH2|4.0|The near perfect tennis experience for the kindle in my opinion, pick this up you will not be disappointed plus it is free
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|it is such a good game cant wait till the online aspect comes it is going to be just that much better
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|I thought that this game is an awesome game that an war person would like but that is just my tarring of this game and I hope other people will like this game as much as I do.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It's a great game! I love that I can play it from my phone and kindle. Beware - it's very addictive. However, you don't need to buy anything to play, as long as you are persistent. Having friends on Facebook helps a lot with extra lives and advancement to additional episodes. Love it!
B007SGLZP8|4.0|It seemed to me to have a slow start in the beginning.  However, Grisham did not let us down with a stunning ending.
B005LAIIMG|5.0|Great movie without all the cussing and nudity normally seen in modern films.  It had a good plot and a nice storyline, it reminded me of the old 1950's monster movies that didn't have as much blood and gore but still kept you at the edge of your chair.
B00C8S9VKM|5.0|Who knew so much went on in 1927?  Bryson is a fabulous author and he has outdone himself with this book.
B000002LK1|5.0|I enjoy nearly all the tracks. I lived the 80's and what memories these tracks bring back. Sound quality is perfection.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Dissapointed thought i would be able to play my videos and pictures on my tablet or phone.  This works nothing like an apple TV.
B009NH6AOQ|3.0|The concept is fantastic, I love the Western symbolism and the ethical questions and dilemmas that confront the characters. Besides who isn't dreaming of a zombie apocalypse as a way to escape a mortgage, taxes and commercial radio?<br />My issue with season 3 is that it, for me, lacked consistent direction. There were too many episodes  that turned what should have been 5 minutes of screen time into  an entire episode. I got the feeling the writers did not know how to fill the space and started to add things during the shoot to fill out time. That is not to say I didn't enjoy the show, it just frustrated me. I am worried that what made the show so engaging for the first two seasons is being eroded by the need to maintain the rating success.
0767812166|5.0|Awesome 80's movie! I saw this as a kid and enjoyed it the second tine around. Jeff Bridges is the perfect alien.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So happy to see this app finally available for my Kindle!  I play Candy Crush Saga waaaaayyy too much, and even more now that it's available on the Kindle.  Have never had a problem with this app.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I love this app I use it everyday.. all I have to do is push one button and I find out how to dress my son for the day.. I am so glad I downloaded it. Thank you
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Great for insomnia.  It has really helped me fall asleep.  I like that I can set the timer before I go to sleep and can choose to have the app close after the timer expires.
B00F56AZK4|3.0|I think this app is ok because it isn't fun. the puzzles are to hard to figure out. so boring.
1451666179|5.0|Oh Allie Brosh! She is so funny, witty, and fully capable of handling serious subjects with great tact. I have read her blog and there are some new stories in this book. I bought the softcover and it is very bulky. GORGEOUS Full color comics on the pages, which I think may be cooler looking on hardcover, considering buying that for me and giving this one to someone else. AWESOME content, 10/10 good job Allie you rock at writing books please WRITE MORE.
B00FWLSOOG|5.0|I would give this 4.5 stars out of 5 instead of a straight 5, but I love it a lot more than I like it so there you go.  Excellent movie.  Lots of references to older monster and giant movies.  This really is what Transformers should have been.  The best thing about this movie, however, is how fresh it is.  It may pay homage, but when it comes down to the nitty gritty, it's a brand new movie. Definitely see it.
B00COGXGNQ|4.0|Julianne Hough plays a perfectly sweet girl who gets caught in a bad situation and has to run away so she can be safe. She finds a small coastal town of Southport to land in where the people are pleasant and everyone are friends. Here she meets a guy, Josh Duhamel, who has lost his wife two years earlier and is raising his two young children alone while running the local general store. They hit it off and she is ready to settle down when her past suddenly catches up with her and she is left with the choice of staying and facing it or running away again. The explosive ending proves that she really has found a Safe Haven where she can be happy forever!
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Aslan has dedicated his life to researching and documenting the historical life of Jesus, the man. I think Aslan does an excellent job of putting the stories associated with Jesus in historical context, and I found the description of the conflict and tension between the original church led by the Apostles, and the rogue version invented by Paul which eventually crushed the preachings of Jesus and emerged as Christianity fascinating.<br /><br />I plan to read one or two of the rebuttal books--at least Bill O'Reilly's--but books I have read in the past which attempt to defend Christianity or the Bible generally rely on an assumption that we first agree that Jesus is the son of God, and accept the divinity of the Bible, and then \\"back that up\\" with a lot of circular arguments based on that false assumption. Plus, Aslan has a doctorate and studied the topic for decades--including citing sources--while the rebuttal books are essentially knee-jerk responses by people who were offended or feel that Aslan has in some way challenged their faith, and most likely rely on citing the Bible as a source to itself. So, I'm not expecting great things from the rebuttal books.
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|Sugar and carbs are the source of the majority of our society's diseases - and I'm sick of seeing people in the hospital because of it. The body is amazing and there is no reason it should break down so quickly - unless it's living in the chronic inflammatory state induced by sugar and carbohydrates. This is a great read detailing the mechanism behind all of our nation's health crises.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Enjoyed reading about the continuation of the Hunger games. Book two moved at a slower pace and too much time was spent on Katniss's back and forth emotions for Gale and Peeta. The ending was great, leaving you with wanting to know what will happen next.
B00BPDR3F6|5.0|Adventures descriptions and the great unsolved mysteries of the universe , all entwined. We are but observers and grateful to be invited.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|Need a few more free helps to get you through the hard levels.Otherwise it is a very entertaining game. Hope there will be a sequel to this game.
0143119680|5.0|An easy way to escape from reality. It did take me a couple of chapters to get into the book. After that, I couldn't put it down.
B003G4W49C|3.0|Not much to say about the book, it was pretty thin on why Ender was such a good choice for his job. Also, almost zero about the enemy and why they did what they did and for that matter, what was it that they did.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|its a great book, cant wait to read the third. the first one was great too. i recommend fifty shades darker.
B004UG7RQ0|5.0|Love it ....now I can use my phone to play music on my Bose player....works like a charm....shipped quickly ...great product.
B007FTZDN8|1.0|this app could not be shut down, kept killing my battery even when using task killer. uninstalled it after 1 day
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love It!!! I'm so happy I was finally able to download it yo my Kindle Fire!!!! It's very addictive!! Love that the levels stay synced with my Iphone.
B00G9U7R2O|5.0|My kids and I loved it!  A sweet, funny movie with a good moral.  My kids are 8 and 10.
B00AYR2FOI|4.0|Probably could have been anywhere in the last 20 years, but still mostly great Boz sound without much filler. For mine, mixed up shook up girl (t3) the stand out, but lots of good material with great playing as production .
B004J4WLB4|4.0|I enjoyed the read.  It was an intriguing concept.  The plot go a bit out of control for me in the realm of believability, but it was still a lovely book.
B001AR0DS6|3.0|I give it three stars because I personally do not like Amy Winehouse. I purchased this as as gift for someone who is a huge fan and was in heights trying to find this particular vinyl.. I must say I am VERY PLEASED at the packaging, the item arrived safely and only three days after I ordered it, even when it was international shipping. Kudos for that!!!! Thank you, I will keep ordering vinyls, no doubt!
030758836X|2.0|This is not a very well-written book.  The characters are not interesting, realistic, or likeable.  It's as though the book was written just so a movie could be made of it, and I've heard that there will be a movie made.  There's a lot of foul language.  There is a mystery and some suspense, which keeps the reader interested, but all in all, I would not recommend this book.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Although I cannot in all honesty say I like it better than The Shining, I must definitely say Doctor Sleep is a great book, one of those you just can't put down. A classic King, although a little predictable, but all in all a very enjoyable reading!!!
B000FCKC4C|5.0|This book made me realize that if you stop, look and listen to the things you are experiencing in the present moment, you will live a more fulfilled life.
B00EP0KBXM|5.0|If you like young adult survival movies you'll love this one. Expect a one on one movie. Not many more actors envolve.
B00BIPMGD0|4.0|Really good show, actors bring the characters to life. Can't wait for the new season to come out. Good job CBS
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I love this game soooo much you can do a lot and its really awesome because you can play mini games and I love how they have the equestria girls dance mini game and you can't get derpy sadly but you can find her she hides in a box and you can get a lot of stuff and you can have a Canterlot. My favorite mlp game the equestria dance mini game you can go to other people's ponyville.
B005P4PAVK|5.0|Makes me laugh<br /><br />It made me laugh out loud, very episode. Taking ordinary querks making them funny to everyone .
B007FLHW3K|3.0|I purchased this light for my grandson's bike and it didn't fit- needed to have an adult bike's wheel circumference.  Could have saved the whole exercise if there were specs on the original buying guide.
B0035LMTZA|4.0|Good action movie. Kept you guessing what was next. Great actors . Enjoyed watching throughout.<br />Really like Theron. She is a stunning lady
B0033H7VI6|4.0|It is a fine work of art, well made, heavy for heavy work, seems very strong and made like a tank, I would have liked a better edge on it is the only down side. It is ok for most any woods lore and craft type of work but I am a fan of a honed edge. I gave one to my son for his birthday and it took me a week and a half with a Lansky diamond hone to get what I like, that is a testament to the hardness of the tool steel blade. Very Satisfied.
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|I think this app is were but fun. My frend shoud me this app. I think this app has good graphics compared to other apps.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|Awesome...hooked from the start......<br />Love the show...would not change anything about it. Please keep the shows comeing. I higly recomend it.
B00902UH5M|5.0|I found this book to be very engaging..almost like Arnold was in the room telling me the story. I feel it provides a lot of insight and humor into his career ups and downs. I am not a California citizen. But I found Mr. Schwarzenegger particularly engaging on his passion for his environmental causes while building up California's infrastructure..his passion and drive to succeed are palpable in his story. love him or not I feel you cannot help but respect his drive. I was surprised by his openness on some topics. Anyway folks. I highly recommend this story and hope you enjoy it!
1601253788|5.0|I fully recommend you get all three. This book, filled with astounding new creatures for the pathfinder/3.5 games, is great. It's hundreds more creatures to throw at your party containing 2 different dragon variants, imperial, and linnorm. But dragons are hardly the only thing offered. Great purchase.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|I have enjoyed playing but do not like having to pay for extra moves.  I am on level 18 and might be there from now on unless I BUY extra moves.  Not good.
B000002KCF|5.0|A great way to replace an lp with a cd. And I got a good cd for a great price.
B005OCFGTO|4.0|Great price for complete set.  It was a hit with my daughter.  It is Basic packaging, so don't expect too much.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Nobody, and I mean absolutely NOBODY , can spin a horror story like the great Mr. King. He never disappoints his readers.
B00AFPTSI0|5.0|This book uses engaging examples and research to show that giving CAN make you successful. The author takes you on a journey that helps you question your own assumptions about successful people.
B0045HCJSK|5.0|This is a movie I have seen a number of times before. The reason I watch it is because I enjoy it every time.<br /><br />It is a fairly typical western for the period. John Wayne is the tough guy. He gets beat up and shot at, but manages to win the day in the end.<br /><br />There is little if anything realistic in this movie. But, that is true of most movies. It would be boring if it was realistic.<br /><br />The Duke plays a small town sheriff who arrests the brother of a land baron for murder and then waits with his deputies (played by Dean Martin and Walter Brennan) for the showdown, while he waits for the US marshal to come rescue them. I have no idea why movies of this type think that a US marshal is going to be involved at all, giving there was no crime involving the US government, but it is the typical spiel.<br /><br />Angie Dickinson plays a card shark who passes through town who quickly becomes the love interest, such as it is. Dean Martin is a drunk who has to sober up. Ricky Nelson plays a credible young gun who signs on as a deputy after his employer is murdered by the land baron's men. Walter Brennan is the typical sidekick and brings an element of needed humor to the film.<br /><br />These are not movies that teach us all that much. They are for entertainment and as such I find them immensely enjoyable. Sit back and have fun watching.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I like this game because it's awesome and I'm really really close to be getting scootaloo and I just love it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Candy Crush is a fun and addictive game.  I'm so glad I was finally able to download it to my Kindle.
B001ANYDAO|5.0|An interesting read for those of us who look to understand what influences outcomes.  Moreover, it may well be an IMPORTANT read for both parents of young children and for those young adults who, today, face the possibility of being economically- and success-deprived due to the combination of relying on the thinking of their parents' generation and of the fact of a global economic depression.  Young adults who can read this both analytically and with introspection may be able to identify where they have missed opportunities and then identify ways to recoup, to exploit hidden opportunities, to create their own new openings to success and happiness.
B00AEFXXFU|5.0|Classic!  Now in HD!!  I think this is a must-see for all teens.  Lots of fun and good memories here.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|THIS game rocks! LOVE it. Play it all the time. Think it is cool. Awesome game. Please download, cause it rocks.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Playing this game is fun and simple at first.  As you challenge each<br />step it gets increasingly more difficult and that's what makes it fun.  The disappointing part is when you have a harder game to conquer and just when you've thought you figured it out, you run out of points to play and have to wait 15 minutes before you earn more points and have to remember how you were going to accomplish that step.  Worth buying!!
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|this is an excellent book of a true story in the region that we hardly know anything about what happens to females in other countries
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love it because the updates are amazing and I realy like how easy it is to play and when I don't know what to play I always know that I have subway surfed to rely on!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />And I mean it :)
B00BPDR3F6|5.0|A book I shall never forget. This is nothing less than a masterpiece. Late in the game, I've just become an ardent admirer of Elizabeth Gilbert. Not to mention her marvellous heroine Alma Wittaker. What a fascinating and deeply affecting story about life and death and the signature of all things.
B00DU74U74|3.0|If I had not read the book first, I would have been somewhat lost. The movie was hard to follow in some areas.
1451639155|4.0|seems the misadventues run in the family. done in the usual fast paced tripping into scenes style that is the usual Miles  adventure even though he is not in this one
B00BD99JMW|2.0|This book does not even compare to the intrigue and suspense we enjoyed in the first two books.  As another reviewer said, the two voices, Tris and Four, are nearly indistinguishable.  At times I had to check the beginning of the chapter to recall whom I was reading about.  I really, truly enjoyed the first two books.  This one was boring and hard to get through.  The author could have done so much more with this story but it left me frustrated and annoyed.
B003V1WTMM|5.0|As alwAys Kate Morton is amazing. Such an interesting book.<br /><br />This is a must read. Even better than the secret garden.
B00F7YHDWC|4.0|I love this catchy song,  a Metro safety ad actually,  and really enjoyed the game.  I was very frustrated by the airplane part since I couldn't do that stage on my Kindle. Then I found the &quot;off&quot; setting for the airplane game!  I burn out on it quickly,  but if you like the tune,  you'll probably enjoy this game.
B00AAI7B7W|5.0|I broke down and purchased this film, the original cut in HD, for Halloween. I was surprised when I saw how clear the picture was! The last time I saw this film it was on TV, and the HD upgrade really does wonders for this film. It is quite creepy for the first 45 minutes, because nothing really happens for the first half of the movie. But later things pick up and there's a lot of craziness (and a lot of pea soup, take my word on it). This is one of the all time scariest movies, in my opinion! Also, look for the faces that appear in the shadows when the lights flicker in the kitchen. CREEEEEE-PYYYYY!  And, watch out for some horrible obscenities. EARMUFFS!
B003TTKB5I|3.0|This is not greys anatomy that you see on tv or tbs. story of girls working in hospital training  to be internist. Wife loved it
B000I8ES70|4.0|I recently watched this film because it came on TV during Halloween. I had seen all the previous Resident Evil movies, and figured I'd continue to watch the rest of the series. I found this to be entertaining in a cheap thrills and one-liners sort of way. Although fun, I am quite stumped by the giant Franken-zombie with a huge meat-tenderizer looking weapon. Really? But I digress. As the heroine, I like that Alice has a \\"heart of gold\\" which is emphasized more in the next movie - Resident Evil Retribution. Lucas West is also a fun character who is introduced here, and also appears in the next movie in this series. Overall, watch it if you have the time and enjoy all-out zombie gore.
B003VANOFY|3.0|I purchased this headset in April 2013 for gaming, but also wanted to use it for VoIP calling and voice recording.<br /><br />First the good:  The quality of the speakers is good, and the cushioned ear pieces make the headset comfortable to wear for long periods.  The microphone quality is very good - I can be on a call or doing recording with a fan or air conditioner running 10 feet away from me; and music from a radio in the background, and the mike will filter all of that out surprisingly well. I also run speech-to-text software and the mike works very well in that regard.<br /><br />Next the bad: The power button is extremely finicky.  Sometimes I need to give it a light push, other times, I have to hold it down for a few seconds, and other times, I have to push in really hard to get the power to come on.  However, the worst part of this headset is that it has an auto-off feature that can not be disabled or even set to a different number of seconds or minutes - AND - the auto-off feature is only based on sound coming through the speakers.  As a result, if I'm doing only voice recording, the headset will shut-off in the middle of what I'm doing.<br /><br />The summary: The audio quality is very good for both listening and speaking. The headset is comfortable to wear and the rechargeable battery lasts sufficiently long before requiring a recharge.  However, for $100, I really think that the power switch should be better made and the auto-shut-off time should at least be configurable or include the option to be disabled.  Based on my particular needs for more microphone use than speaker use, I would not buy this product again.
B00455IVHU|4.0|It was an interesting concept but kept your interest. I enjoyed it! Would recommend it to the over 50 generation!

B000H4TX9I|5.0|Too bad they didn't make more of this show.  I found it quite refreshing, not the typical sci-fi space travelers.  The western themes I thought were a bit hokey at first but it really seemed to work for this show.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|5 stars a wonderful story. It is nothing but a romance with a twist. If your looking for a romance  book I recommend this to you
B00ET0PZDO|5.0|This game is my favorite so far. I was sad that it only had fourteen levels. I did get stuck a few times but leaving it alone and coming back to it would give me fresh perspective. I recommend it
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|It's a good game I love playing it! I recommend it to anyone who likes simple puzzle or goth games!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|you need to give some idea what is expected so you wont waste so many lives,surely money isn't the sole end to this game
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is the first time ever playing Candy Crush. The  best game ever on Kindle. I am now addicted to the game. Thank you<br />Sandygal
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|this game is the best thinking game I have ever played in my whole lifestyle. I love this game cause it makes you have think.

B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Very good book. Can't wait for the next one. The Crossfire series was Great. Sylvia Day os a great author
B00EP0SIOG|4.0|To be honest, if I hadn't received a Sphero as a review unit through the Amazon Vine program, I probably would never have bought one. It's just kind of hard to conceive of the point of the toy prior to using one. But now that a Sphero has moved into our house, well, I'm kind of glad he's here. My daughters have certainly enjoyed playing with it, especially the eleven-year-old, who has adopted it as a kind of pet. She routinely brings it with her to friends' houses, for example.<br /><br />One downside of the device is that its movements can only be controlled by one person at a time. So you can't, for example, play a game in which two people with iPhones are rolling the ball back and forth to one another. And the one single ball, multiplayer game I'm aware of--ColorGrab, where players snatch the ball when it turns a particular color--seems kind of lame. It's also not using the movement capabilities of the Sphero; just its color-changing abilities. (You can play multiplayer games when you have a number of Spheros in a room, but how likely is that?) Instead, you can do things like set up routes and take turns trying to make it through them, or you can download the zombie iPhone app and try to crush the zombies that magically pop on your screen when you're viewing your Sphero in action (better on a larger screen like an iPad Mini than on an iPhone screen).<br /><br />I can definitely understand those reviewers who suggest that the appeal of the toy is limited, that it's something you'll play with a couple of times and then forget about. For myself, that's doubtless true: I've enjoyed my trial usage, but I'm unlikely to pick it up while the kids are off at school and make Sphero tool around the house. My experience suggests, however, that kids will get a lot more mileage out of it. My younger daughter has already clocked a lot of hours with it. I expect Sphero would also be great if you have cats--though I can't attest to this personally as I am woefully catless.<br /><br />-- Debra Hamelbr />-- Debra Hamel
B00BP4X3W2|5.0|Schindler's List is an award winning film produced by Steven Spielberg. Schindler's List is also a list, produced by Oskar Schindler, of 1100 Jews whose lives were saved from a horrific death in a concentration camp at Auschwitz. The film begins in September of 1939. Jews were ordered to register their families and move to a walled 16 block ghetto of Krakow. Jews were forced from their homes. Families were separated. They were not allowed to own homes or any item of value.<br /> Schindler opened a cookware factory and employed men, women, and children from the ghetto to work for him. Schindler's accountant Stern helps him with the financial and human resource aspects of his business. The business is successful and Schindler becomes a wealthy man until Amon Goeth, an SS lieutenant, gives word to his men the ghetto must destroyed. People are brutally hunted down and murdered while Schindler watches. The survivors are taken back to a camp with Goeth as the overseer.<br /> Schindler, a German member of the Nazi party, pays for all of his workers freedom from an inevitable death. He opens a new factory in his hometown and goes broke keeping the business going. When World War II is over, Schindler flees the country and urges his workers to find what is left of their families. Liam Neeson, as Oskar Schindler, gives an outstanding performance in one of the last scenes of the movie. Schindler is given a gold ring by his workers in thanks. He weeps at the thought of not saving more people and spending too much money on luxuries.<br /> This movie shows how Jewish people were beaten and murdered people only because of religion. Judaism is a world religion practiced by millions. There are several references in the movie regarding customs practiced. Near the end Schindler asked a factory worker and rabbi if he forgot to prepare for the Sabbath. The Sabbath begins sundown Friday evening. The men of the factory gathered around a table of lit candles. The movie also begins with a Jewish family lighting the candles in celebration of the Shabbat.<br /> The ring given to Schindler was engraved with a quote from the Talmud: \\"He who saves one life saves the world entire\\". This sentiment brought Schindler to tears. He felt as though he could have done more, but 6,000 descendents came from the 1,100 Schindler saved.<br /> Schindler's List is a dark and disturbing example of one of the worst times in history. This film is thought provoking and can be the source of discussion about violence and respect of religious differences.
1451666179|5.0|First of all, I have to say that I actually did purchase this book. Also, it is excellently color-coded.<br /><br />OK so here's the thing. This book is a magic packet of glee-generating mushy madness. I love it almost as much as it loves me. When I walk around on the streets carrying it, people will randomly come up to me, look at the book, and start to giggle. Sometimes it happens in big crowds, especially when I am on the subway. I think I have actually begun to suffer from some hearing loss as a result of all of the spontaneous snickering, chuckling, crying with laughter, and farting in terror that occurs around me when I carry this book. I have three cats. I have gotten into the habit of moving this book to a high place that the cats cannot reach because its pages function as some kind of strange super catnip madness. Even my cats can tell, at 50 yards, that there is some cracktacular yummies in there.<br /><br />I have also found that the jacket of the book is capable of functioning as a ward against evil. Recently, a local policeman who usually tickets me for my tendency to walk around with a stuffed alot made a vampire-like hissing noise and ran away when I held this book out in front of me. It even exudes a luxurious and pleasing odor that wards off the smell of pee from my three cats. I left it on top of the washer at the laundromat and not only did my clothes come out smelling better, they were cleaner as well. If this book were a beautiful woman, and I were not already married, I would marry it.<br /><br />Finally, you should buy this book because its author is awesome. The core of her life seeps from this book like the sap from a maple tree being tapped for syrup. And she has already boiled her ideas so much that all that is left is the maple flavored essence. Also, it is yellow.
B00ATSBIIG|1.0|When I tried to download this app it caused my whole kindle system and my home router to crash. I had to reboot everything several times. I deleted it.
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|I loved this book.  It was excited, amazing, and filled with wonder and a sort of scary delight.  There was action everywhere and I feared totally for every one of the Reckoners lives at all times...<br /><br />The story is this...David sees his father get brutally murdered by an epic godlike man named Steelheart.  These times that David lives in are tough ones.  Epics like Steelheart rule with an iron hand or in this case with a steel one...he and others like him can not be killed but David and others try to bring them down in an amazing number of ways.  Steelheart uses people, kills people and laughs while he does it.  David has spent the last ten years of his young life trying to figure out how to kill him.  He joins a rogue group called the Reckoners to fulfill his lifelong quest to kill Steelheart.  This is truly exciting stuff...rather like watching and rooting for Tom Cruise in a Mission Impossible movie.  I can not even remotely begin to relate to you the breathless pace of this book...and I believe that there are more books to come in this series.<br /><br />This book would make a brilliant movie...truly!
1401917232|5.0|This book is just what I was hoping for after reading Gary Renard's first 2 books.  It was well worth the wait
B001NLL93W|4.0|The writing improved over the first two of the series.  The characters developed with the story.  Best of the first three in the series.
0385743564|3.0|I heard about Brandon Sanderson's works before but this is the first book of his I have read. I liked his writing style but at the same time I am kind of disappointed. I mean, I liked the world-building, I did like the action and a lot of it made sense, but the characterization was kind of thin for my taste. If this is the start of the series, I hope characters will get more fleshed out later on.
B00457X7XQ|4.0|I enjoyed the technical accuracy.  I would have liked more details and engagement of the government resources.  I don't believe they are all as incompetent as would be implied.  But a fun story and we'll worth the read.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|this game is so fun and addicting. I would recommend it highly. been waiting for it to be out on my kindle and was happy to see it
B00B7PIRIE|3.0|There are areas on the discs that act like you are losing satellite service, even though it is on disc. Other than that it is acceptable.
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|Fantasic new read with a new take on an older premise.  Sanderson proves himself to be a great author, yet again.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love the game so much. It was so much fun with the all of the obstacles and the challenges in the game. I give this a two thumbs up.
B0027MJU00|5.0|This book is like a runaway train, once it starts rolling you can't stop until you get to the end. It was spellbinding, frightening, crazy, and so very eerily real in an every day kind of way. I found myself feeling so sad for the hungry sad children in misshapen clothing and the shame of being poor..I remember kids like these. But the horror of the dark places was one I will remember forevermore. Gillian Flynn has a style that keeps the reader glued to the book into the night when we find ourselves jumping at shadows..every book I read by her makes me want another.
B004PAHZMC|5.0|This is nicely made and purfect for maybe one set of Legos. It opens up into a Battle Bridge playmat so my Grandsons imagination takes over and he has a great time with it.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|This just drives me crazy, I just want the weather, instead I get &quot;you get 5+&quot;. Really? The add on it wasn't enough? And then the app locks up and so you have to upload. Who in their right mind would Want that garbage.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The best read since the harry potter series.  A classic and fitting for these dark times. Don't take my word for it--READ IT!!!
B00FRQ32N4|1.0|App never downloaded completely, no way to cancel it just continues to start and restart download process but never completes.,,
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this app I think you will love it!! it is the ultimate game because it is awesome game!!!!!!!
B00FR3QVW6|5.0|Complex rhythms, catchy melodies, and thoughtful lyrics make this a solid step forward in the Family Tree collection. A perfect album to accompany fall.
B00DGN51O8|4.0|It was an interesting take on the old story and it had enough comedic moments in it to be entertaining.
B003QP4NPE|5.0|This book is seriously amazing! One of the most creative plots I've read in a long time. It should be made into a movie because it would be a huge hit!
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Super fun. Nothing like the movie. Book better than the movie(s). Read book first and then watched movie. Kept waiting for something more than the very basics of plot to appear from the book in the movie. Never happened.
B00006ZXSK|5.0|One of her favorite movies, my mom needed to replace her VHS that got stuck in a tape player. Perfect gift for her!
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|Candy Crush is evil. Addictive. Just Say, &#34;No&#34;.  Ultimately Expensive. Frustrating. I wish I had never started this game. I should have listened
B00FWLSLJ4|4.0|Cool special effects and good story. It is a modern destroy all monster movie. Reminds me a little of Godzilla.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This app is so easy to use. I love how I can have so many custom alarms set. You have the option to name each alarm setting. How cool is that?
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|CANDY CRUSH SAGA<br />I enjoy playing this when ever I can. It is fast moving and challenging.  I enjoy it just as much as play cards
B00EY7MFKS|5.0|This is a terrific series for Marvel fans!  My wife thinks there are too many 'young, pretty people' in the cast - but it's defense: first, this is television after all, and second, ya have to give it time.  After only three episodes  I can see that Whedon is working his back-story magic with these characters, and Clark Gregg plays his impeccable, implacable Agent Coulson self to perfection.  Overall this is a very fun series, and yes, the cast is rather 'easy on the eyes'.  I'm sure the cast will balance out with a broader variety of ages and personalities...since the Marvel 'verse is rather large, and well-stocked.  ;-)  Overall, this is (now) my new favorite TV series today.
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|Was addicted to the Angry Birds games.  Now I find myself playing V nonstop.  Thanx for an excellent game.  Keep them coming.
B00CZ7OC46|4.0|Remote: Office Not Required<br /><br />I'm a fan of 37 signals.com. They provide software that really makes your working life a lot easier.<br /><br />I enjoyed their other book, Rework, and I enjoyed Remote, as it shows managers the importance of remote workers (the people not clogged up all the time in the office) and that not being sat in a cubicle a few meters away does not mean good work can’t be done.<br /><br />A few years ago I attended a course at the excellent Ashridge business school on managing remote teams. I wish I had this book at the time. The course taught me a lot. This book provides some excellent tips.<br /><br />It gives good advice on managing – whether team members are sat next to you or a few thousand miles away – and excellent tips on how to measure performance (it is not measured by being at your desk 9am-9pm), and recruiting new colleagues.<br /><br />The remote toolbox<br /><br />I liked the final chapter where it provides some tips on making this all happen.<br /><br />37 signals recommendations<br />– Basecamp. This is a piece of software allows you to manage all your projects in one place. I like it a lot.<br /><br />– I also like Evernote that allows you to manage projects in one place and some other things on top. This is basecamp’s competition in my eyes.<br /><br />– WebEx. They described this as the go to tool for sharing screen. I liked working with it in the past.<br /><br />– Know your company. They describe this as a piece of software to understand where the culture of the company is.<br /><br />– Skype. This allows you to call in videoconference your colleagues clients and friends. It also allows you to share the screen. I am a big fan. Good quality phone calls at little to no price. I just did a videoconference and the quality was good.<br /><br />– To share files they recommend dropbox.<br /><br />– I also like toggl, it makes recording billable hours very easy.<br /><br />Useful Lessons from Chicago<br /><br />It's a good book, which describes the journey of a successful midwestern firm from start up to one today that helps make the lives of countless firms and people a lot easier.<br /><br />It helps you understand that you can expand as a company and have access to the very best people, but not be crammed in an airless room. It shows you that growth does not come at the price of soulless commuting and sacrificing your family life.<br /><br />If you thought this was all possible but thought this technology was only available to the few, then think again. The means are now available that enables you, your colleagues, and your clients run successful and dynamic companies all from their home, beach front cabin or coffee lounge. The office of today is available to anyone who needs oxygen to think of new ideas to solve problems for clients and think of new ways to deliver better products at lower prices.
B009CG29RK|4.0|Adorable!! Great family show. Loved it. Big hit with the kids. Watch again for sure. Two thumbs up. Yes!! Yes!
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|This is a fun game..... I love the different stages and characters! My kids even love it... it's not too gory for an 8 year old. But I play it more!
B00FPGSPQU|4.0|I love these guys. The movie was full of twists and turns. They didn't use their typical format on this hangover movie, but that was part of what made if good. You should see this movie.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|love the game but don't. think you should have to wait for friends to send you lives to open new levels.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|so addicting and I'm so happy its available for the kindle. I was constantly looking for it! thank u amazon. app works good except for sometimes running slow, don't know if its the game itself or just my kindle.
B00ADQCBEY|1.0|We were surprised at the language and sex on the show.  We prefer shows with a strong story line rather than depending on questionable material.
B00FAX6XQC|1.0|on the kindle it wont download but if it does it doesn't let you play the game!!the game stinks with the kindle fire so don't get it!!!!!!
B00BD99JMW|2.0|After Divergent, I was a one woman Veronica Roth promoting machine. I told everyone I knew how smart the character of Tris was, how easily you'd find yourself in love with her, and how she was the anti-Bella. I waited eagerly for the second installment in the trilogy.<br /><br />I felt as if Tris turned into a wildly unlikeable character in Insurgent. Reckless, fickle, and unintelligent - so different from the Tris we had gotten to know. Even still, I looked forward to the completion of the series and to know the conclusion for Four and Tris.<br /><br />I am so disappointed in this ending. Instead of Roth correcting her errors, she takes the readers on a wild, twisting read that frankly pushes towards the unbelievable even in dystopian YA fiction and attempts to redeem Tris in potentially the worst way she could have conceived.<br /><br />I no longer look forward to reading anything from this author and am sad at the waste of a remarkable heroine.
B00471Z3CI|5.0|One of those movies that could happen to you and your family.  Defiantly in my top 10 list of horror favorites!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Really enjoy this game. What I like most about it is that there's strategy involved. Many games of this nature have you on a time limit but thus, fire the most part, puts you on a &quot;move&quot; limit. Gives you time to strategize. Really enjoy this game and the challenge it provides.
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|I think that I have read too many of these type of books. I really liked Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn and The Husband's Secret by Liane Moriarty.  I felt like The Silent Wife : A Novel tended to go on too long. I liked the twist at the end. I really felt that the two aforementioned books were better but I read them one right after another. The reader who has not read these other books recently, may enjoy The Silent Wife more than I did. It was well written with an interesting ending.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I was confused in the first 4 chapters, but then after that it was well written and had a wonderful storyline.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I spend hours playing games and keeping up with friend's i have had for year's and new ones I met on Facebook.
B00DOPEGAS|5.0|Kids are having a blast with this product.  My 8 year old needed some help understanding the instructions. We had fun making few bracelets.
B007PKSN6Q|2.0|During the movie I thought the songs were super...but just playing as a CD left me missing something...made me want original singers...I gave it away...
B00G32OER4|4.0|Spooky! Worth watching. I was at the edge of my seat almost the whole movie. Not too gory, just good old fashioned suspense!
B0045HCJ9E|5.0|It's classical Alfred Hitchcock...keeps you on edge the whole movie...they don't make 'em like this anymore...and you'll want to watch again and again...
B00D2K40WY|5.0|This game is so fun! I have the prom salon game too, also from LiBii, but this one is much better and more fun. I am a lover of my kindle fire and I'm on here everyday, so I usually play this game everyday. And every time I play this game, I love it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|my opinion is  great because candy crush saga is a good game you match things I loooooooovvvvvvvvveeeeeee it do much
B0088W4YTK|4.0|This is the second or third time I've watched this show and I appreciate Amazon putting it on prime,  because Netflix did away with it.  This is a fun,  interesting show.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game I all was have live this game so you should get it and try it out but I think you will love this game like I do
B004U8VX2M|5.0|This series aired in the early seventies, but 40 years later, it is still a masterful piece of storytelling.  What is compelling about the story of the family of 135 Eaton Place is that the everyday family conflicts are relevant in today's time though they supposedly take place 100 years earlier. The dynamic between servant and master is wonderfully told and brings a humanity to the serving class rarely seen in period pieces.  So happy that I have discovered Upstairs, Downstairs.
B005LLSZNM|5.0|It's a great show didn't think I would like it. The acting is very good also. I love this show.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Love this game. Just started playing Temple Run. It is a fun game. I love the graphics. No complaints as of now. I will probably buy the Wizard of Oz version of this game. I have Minion Rush which is a lot similar.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Great book, couldn't put it down! Looking forward to the movie & planning to read more of this authors books.
B0018D4SHY|5.0|Great music, price, fast delivery, and just as advertised. Highly recommend CD and retailer. Brings back the good old times when music was real music. Keep um coming!!!
0812982622|4.0|When most people think of North Korea, as many reviews have mentioned, they usually see population that are brainwashed and zombie-like. After reading this novel, you will have a whole new insight in what it is like to live in North Korea. Adam Johnson’s research on North Korea is evident and by simply reading this novel, you feel like an expert on North Korea and as if you have lived there for many years.<br />The story itself is about a life of a man named Jun Do, who is the son of an Orphan Master, but is treated as one of the orphans. In North Korea, orphans are at the bottom of the social chain and are often given jobs that result in death. Jun Do though is able to rise to the ranks and then that is where things get interesting.<br />At times the novel is hard to read as the narrator changes from chapter to chapter and includes content that young or sensitive readers may find unappealing, but most people will find the book a good use of their time and money.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Hey One of my favorite movies.. loved every minute of it... I will watch it over and over again and again bam!
B00G32OER4|5.0|I so loved this movie.It kept me on the edge of my seat. I recommend this movie if you like evil spirit possession movies. Great scary movie!
006202406X|1.0|While Ive been looking forward to this book for months, halfway through reading it I had to re-check the title and make sure it was the correct series.  ****SPOILERS*****<br /><br />The POV thing was horrid.  Plain and simple, it was awful.  If the characters had come to life and showed some personality it would have been decent but UGH!<br /><br />My other pet peeve was why in the world did Four get so upset over not having \\"pure\\" genes?  It seemed like a kid getting mad that he had grape jelly on his sandwich instead of strawberry.  Or a blue eyed kid getting made that he couldn't have the label of brown eyes instead.<br /><br />My last bone to pick was with Four's mom.  Was this Invasion of the Bodysnatchers at the end? Throughout the series she has been this evil, diabolical woman who wants to change the world to fit her view.  Then all of a sudden shes a warm, snuggly teddy bear of a mom who only wants to do right?  Bleh.
006202406X|2.0|I anticipated this book for so long and I was so insanely disappointed. I don't even know what to say.
B00BYISQTO|5.0|Wonderful music.  I heard the National on &#34;Q,&#34; the radio program from Canada on NPR, so ordered the CD.  The music is addicting.  I've listened to it several times and am still not ready to switch to another CD.
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|What an incredible story! Well written and informative. This is one courageous young woman. Everyone should read this book and pass it along.
B00471TLZS|5.0|scary, scary, scary, scary, scary!!  oldie but a goodie!!  i love owning this movie.  always good year round but a definite must have for the halloween season!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|can't wait for more, more! Has definitely become my favorite show! Enjoy the scenery as much as the delightful characters.
0061950726|5.0|Interesting and a quick read.  I prefer the olden days days storyline,  How fortunate I am to have had a loving family during my lifetime.
B005804NCI|5.0|Definitely one of the best SACDs that I've bought or listened to. That's really worth buying. The comparison with the regular Audio CD leaves no doubts. Clear sound, great bass, AOR at its best, with a super sound, great sound separation (channels), you perceive every single detail.
B00FG5E03W|5.0|After watching this tonight I was amazed it hasn't been given bigger fanfare in the U.S. It had me spellbound from moment one to the last. I could go on about this for paragraphs, but I think I still wouldn't do this masterpiece justice.....so I'll just say WATCH IT IF YOU HAVEN'T.
B00000JNJ1|5.0|This is a band that I consider a finding, forgive me who were already aware of them. I've started to listen, and when it reaches the fourth song (Sweet Lady Mary) you know there's something else about it. Debris is another ellegant song, for a group kind of sloopy sometimes. Man, great CD, and band. And having any other CD they produced, this is a really complete collection. The only song that's really missing is the version of \\"Maybe I'm Amazed\\". Besides that, the best collection possible of The Faces.
B002PEP4SC|4.0|Great story telling!  Fast paced and enjoyable interaction between main characters.  Will pick up another Castle book for a Saturday night read.<br />Darsergent
B0038ZITHK|5.0|One h... of a movie, really underrated in my opinion. And the blu-ray image is great here in this case. Must have for any movie fan.
B009K0P10K|5.0|One of the best series on television. Finished season 1 and had to go directly to season 2. Kudos to the writers
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|If I hadn't read the books, I probably would have really enjoyed this movie. There were so many things left out or changed that it was disappointing. I found that I kept saying through the whole movie, &#34;That's not how that happened&#34;, or &#34;That's wrong&#34;.<br />When you read the books, you get the whole back story, why Katniss has the attitude she does or the relationship between her and Peeta. She's very naive and this movie doesn't give that impression. It's not just about Katniss learning to trust people, it's a trust and love that is being built between her and Peeta.<br />How do/did they plan to factor in that Peeta lost his leg? They didn't have anything alluding to that part of the book.<br />I was disappointed but it's still a good story.
1423140605|5.0|the continuation of the series kept me riveted to the books and wanting more. the authors use of ancient greek mythology and his total creation of these new myths is out of this world
B00BD99JMW|4.0|A good easy read.  Definitely not the ending I expected though. I would recommend the entire series. Four stars because it was not my favorite in the trilogy.
1476727651|3.0|I was looking forward, with unbridled excitement, to reading &#34;Doctor Sleep&#34; for many months. Sadly, I was disappointed in the book overall. The character of Danny is, well, boring, and rather a wimp. The villains: Rose the Hat and other members of the True Knot, are much more colorful and likeable... you almost want to root for them instead of Danny and Abra, his 13-year-old friend who's being hunted by a band of energy vampires. Great description and graphic details, as always, but I was expecting more from King's first ever sequel. We waited 40 years for this??? Too bad.
B000002GVZ|5.0|This is an ok CD but I forgot that Tapestry is really her best but a good one to add to the collection
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book kept me into the storyline.  Hard to put down until I finished it.  Now I am left wanting more of Katness.
B007T7MIR0|1.0|Ive been deleting apps and files because it said there wasnt room for this app on my Kindle but it still gives me the same error message after multiple trys.  Amazons website says it compatible with my device and theres plenty of room for it but no such luck.  I have no idea how it works.
B00G32OMF8|2.0|I have been a big fan of this series for eighteen years.  I like the characters, acting, dialog, and they way Jesse, and Celine connect.  But this third movie in the franchise took everything I liked, and used it as a bludgeon of negativity.  It was exhausting to watch.<br />If you liked the romanticism of the first two movies, I highly recommend not watching this film, because \\"Before Midnight\\" will  tarnish them.<br /><br />***This Part Has Spoilers***<br /><br />Celine has become a self obsesses, uncompromising,  miserable, mean-spirited, drama queen.  Living in her own self created world of pessimism, cynical delusions, and dissatisfaction.  Trapped in the juvenile, militant, feminist dogma of a first year woman's study major.  Basically taking the position of  \\"My job is more important than us living close to your son for a few years even though not being around him is breaking your heart\\".  It reminded me of a response someone had written about the movie \\"The Five Years Engagement\\" called \\"How Hollywood Portrays Women as Evil(or something like that)\\".  Seriously, it is one of the worst depictions of a female character I have seen in a long time.<br /><br />Jesse, is still Peter Pan-ing it a bit, while also coming to grips with getting older.  He kind of  yo-yo's between trying to be reasonable, and understanding, then getting  pulled into Celine's negativity, and saying something terrible.  In the end, I think the only way the creators thought they could balance out  Jesse with Celine's awfulness was to throw in the last minute \\"Jesse cheated on Celine\\".  I really did not like that.  First, because it seemed out character for Jesse, and second it's arbitrariness.<br /><br />I am not sure understand the story this movie is trying to tell.  My assumption is \\"Hey let's make a movie about the worst fight these two will ever have, and can they survive it.\\", or was it more \\"A day in the life\\", \\"this is their dynamic.\\".  Either way I thought it was over the top, andincredibly mean spirited.  I am sure some will say with how \\"honest\\", and \\"realistic\\" this movie is.  Maybe so, but only in its own, warped,  self defining reality.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Not the greatest, but a good read and love the tie in to The Shining. I would read it again.
B0049J0DC8|5.0|Cute movie. My kids really enjoy this movie. It has a cute story line and fun characters, it's a must have for very movie collection.
B00F91SCXC|2.0|Better than I expected it to be.<br />Storyline was weak.  My 13 yr old chose this movie. Zombies are not my thing. But Brad Pit IS.
6305428042|5.0|I bought this from amazon for my kids, so that we would have a Halloween show to watch. I never imagined how much they would love it. My 5 year old daughter asks to watch this show every day and decided to change her Halloween costume from Princess Sophia to &#34;the bossy Sanderson sister&#34;
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|This app cleared out 7.6 GB out of my hard drive, now my really is so much faster thanks to this app.
B00F8MI9NK|5.0|This prequel to Monsters Inc. was fantastic. My kids love this movie and are constantly asking to watch it again. It's fun to see how all the characters fit together.
B000002OOY|5.0|Great soundtrack. I owned it years ago and have been looking for a new copy. A friend recommended that I try Amazon, and I am fabulously excited to have a new copy that is in great condition.
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|This was a cute movie. I watched it with my husband and we were both pleasantly impressed. The actors did a great job and this one has a bit of a twist and intensity that most Nicolas Sparks doesn't usually have.
B00F8MI9NK|5.0|My kids love it. It keeps them entertained for hours. Even my two year old enjoys the movie as much as the seven year old.
B00FRMCYQ4|5.0|This is a cute show about a snail who ends up with super powers that make him behave like a car. We watched this with our 4 and 2 year olds and they seemed to really enjoy it. I thought it was funny and had a good story line.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|This game is boss I beat the whole game but now I'm waiting for online because I don't have a Facebook account . So please look at this feedback/ratings
0786956127|5.0|Awesome product for D&D fans. My boyfriend really liked this set. The cardboard was thick and came in a good variety of tiles. There are several large tiles, medium tiles, and small points of interest like bushes, a statue, a graveyard, cave.

B00280LYIC|5.0|This book reminds me a lot like Harry Potter.  It's about a boy destined to be something.  They both have or had a famous parent(s).  I'm was not a huge greek mythology fan before I read this but know it is quite interesting. If your not a greek fan then you should still try the first book. It will basically tell you if this series is made for you. It was made for me.
B007HGPBRC|4.0|An insightful look at how fragile and precious life can be. Enjoy today, for tomorrow is not guaranteed for anyone.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I love this game but I touch one thing by accident and it took all my token which I was saving. After you touch it by accident it should gave a sign saying if your sure you want to......... with your tokens . This company should really take my advice
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|I can watch this movie over and over again. The production value is amazing, Ridley Scott never fails to impress.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|I have this connected through my Onkyo NR616, which is connected to my non-HDMI TV via an HDMI > DVI cable.  My cable box and Roku display just fine via this method.  The Chromecast does not.  I get the sound through my receiver, but no video.  As I have a Roku already, I bought this because of the low price and the novelty (and I thought the auto input switching would may for a better way to fire up Pandora from my phone).  So while it does work for that particular use case, with no video, it's really just a novelty at this point.  It's a slick package and a great idea and I hope there will be more content available when I replace my TV with one that can accept HDMI.
B00499NHLC|5.0|Outstanding writing, superb acting. An intelligent and engaging program from beginning to end. Great body of work. I recommend it without reservation.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Works as advertised.  Pretty easy setup.  Not at all obtrusive (can't even see it once installed).  Using the iPhone as a remote control is quirky.  Works much better with a PC.  Excellent picture, good sound.  Every now and then the sound gets out of sync with the picture while streaming.  This could have something to do with bandwith.  But definitely worth the $35.
B0036S4B6M|3.0|First, let me say that fans of the Netflix series will be disappointed if they expect the story to be anything at all like the show. This is a memoir, not dramatic fiction. Many of the characters bear a passing resemblance to people described in the book and there are a few details which transferred nicely (e.g., the pudding from Desert Storm), but the story of Piper Chapman barely resembles Piper Kerman's.<br /><br />I was disappointed in the book for two reasons. First, I had hoped that Kerman would tell the other women's stories. She doesn't. In most cases, we don't even know why they are incarcerated and aren't given enough information about appearance to visualize them. She talks about these women as if they were close friends, but there isn't enough detail for readers to get to know these people or to care about them. She leaves the impression that she didn't really know these women at all, which isn't surprising given my second point, which is that she comes off as a bit narcissistic.<br /><br />The book is rather self-indulgent, without revealing much about Kerman that makes us care about her. She spends a lot of time praising herself through her characters. She also has nothing but praise for the people she likes and loves, which is unrealistic and makes those people seem flat.<br /><br />Kerman says that takes responsibility for what she did, but complains so much about mandatory minimum sentences that it almost negates the remorse. I will give her this: at one point late in the book she does talk about seeing the effects of drugs on the live's of so many others (fellow inmates) and appears to be sincere in her regret.<br /><br />Kerman's complaints of prison life are sometimes offensive in the sense that she seems to expect prison to be more like a vacation. Although I understand that reform should be a main objective and I was appalled to read about how little the system did to prepare these women for release, there are many complaints about daily life which come off as whiny and seemingly ignore the fact that prison is not supposed to be pleasant.<br /><br />All of that said, it's a fairly short read with a few interesting insights if you can get through all of the less-than-believable, &#34;Oh, everyone was so great and I'm so fortunate and I'm so great&#34; stuff without vomiting.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Luv this series! I had a Downton Abbey marathon...vegged out and it was entertaining. Start with Season one..you won't be sorry.
B00D2ZF3GQ|2.0|I expect an action/adventure film to have a lot of action, but this film moves very, very slowly. It really doesn't pick up until the last 20 or 30 minutes. There are some impressive visuals and special effects, but other than that, there's not much to keep the viewer's interest. Jaden Smith does a pretty good job, but Will Smith seems almost comatose. I think that in his effort to portray an emotionally remote father, he over-did things. Or maybe he's just not cut out for that kind of role.<br /><br />The picture quality and audio on the Blu-Ray are outstanding. It's just too bad that the movie itself falls short. I'm glad I rented and didn't buy.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Does all I need and more, happy with the purchase as it works effortless. Thanks Google for making this little device :-)
B008LXZFH6|5.0|My wife and grown daughter watch this movie 2-3 times a year and are looking forward to the sequel in December 2014.  Will has some really funny lines (which they use for private communication...then crack up).
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Certainly as addicting.  The different challenges keep it interesting.  I wish there was a way to bank more lives.  5 isn't enough for a bout of insomnia...
B005PK57NU|5.0|Great TV!  There are twists and turns each episode.  We especially enjoy the lack of commercials.  Watching a show when you want to watch is icing on the cake.
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|I enjoy the match-three games,  and this one was good,<br />but there are better games.  The music is slow and annoying.  The game hits you up for money at every turn.  You can't move pass level 35 unless you pay.<br />Not a big fan.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I found this a poignant end to the series. Characters remained true to their natures throughout it, and in many cases we saw the consequences of that, which is rare in a young adult book where everyone tends to come out roses even when they have to make the hard decisions.<br /><br />I was somewhat disappointed in the big reveal, hoping for something more interesting and less cliche, but even with that loss of expectations the author did a decent job at making it work with what it was.<br /><br />This trilogy needs to be looked as a tale of morality, of bigotry, of perception and propaganda. It's a fable, not an air-tight encyclopedia of events. Pieces will fail to add up, gaps will exist here and there, but ultimately the reader will take away something from the experience and hopefully it will make them think and examine their own life choices and motivations and question how much of what we're told is The Way of Things is just tribal lore rather than fact.
B0064MGU98|5.0|Great show! Interesting interpersonal dynamics and a good look into an expensive, elite defense law firm. Shows the complications that she encounters when her former state's attorney husband is caught cheating and goes to prison, forcing her to start working as a 1st year associate after being a stay at home mom.
B00EVW0VTI|4.0|White House Down = Olympus Has Fallen and vice versa.  Now I don't know whose idea to make this story into a movie was first, but they are very close with only minor differences from my viewpoint.  In each case terrorists invade the White House, hold hostages, and ask for money or release of prisoners or threaten to nuke people.  That said I still enjoyed them both as action movies in the vain of Diehard, Bourne Identity, and others of this genre.  Worth at least a rental, and I watch and enjoy this type movie enough I bought them both.  Of the two I like White House Down a little better and even my wife seemed to enjoy that one.<br /><br />Synopsis of White House Down:<br />Capitol Policeman John Cale (Channing Tatum) has just been denied his dream job with the Secret Service of protecting President James Sawyer (Jamie Foxx). Not wanting to let down his little girl with the news, he takes her on a tour of the White House, when the complex is overtaken by a heavily armed paramilitary group.<br /><br />Synopsis of Olympus Has Fallen:<br />A terrorist mastermind kidnaps the President of the United States inside the White House, and a disgraced former Secret Service agent must save the President and take down the terrorists.<br /><br />Recommendations: [[ASIN:B000SZK41M Die Hard]], [[ASIN:B001EBV0L2 Lethal Weapon]], [[ASIN:B001EC2IS0 Under Siege]], [[ASIN:B000Q4RJWW Air Force One]], [[ASIN:B001N3UO68 Executive Decision]], [[ASIN:B00BESC3XY RED DAWN [HD]]], and [[ASIN:B004OB2EYQ The Fourth Protocol]]<br /><br />CA Luster

B00CTSDDVO|2.0|Let's start off with the following disclaimer... I am a huge original-series Star Trek fan, and have compared each subsequent series or film to that original show.  In some cases, the latter works compared favorably, and in others unfavorably, but all have the original series as the main \\"yardstick\\" in my mind.  This film, and its predescessor, fall into that same category... as far as I'm concerned, they exist in the shadow of the ORIGINAL, and must be compared to it.  After all, the original is still watched, today, after almost half a century.  None of what has followed on has shown anything remotely like the same \\"legs\\" that the original show did.<br /><br />The reason that the original series was, in my opinion, so wonderful was almost something \\"alchemical\\"...  a remarkable mix of many, many element which just came together to form a fantastic whole.  While the original concepts and much of the character development came from Gene Roddenberry, he was far, far from alone in the creation of the original Star Trek.  And much of what came into being grew, not from his imagination, but from the active involvement of others unrelated to him (Gene Coon, to me, gets more credit than Gene Roddenberry does, for example, and each actor had a large role in defining their own characters).<br /><br />The design, done by a man with a real technical design background (in aerospace), named Walter (\\"Matt\\") Jefferies.  The prop designs, and many of the more complex makeup designs, as well as the Romulan design...  by a master artisan named Wah Chang.  The music (not just the original fanfare by Alexander Courage, but the many other musical elements, in many cases long since forgotten by modern Trek composers, and to me sorely missed)...  the scripts written, in many cases, by accomplished prose authors...  some really great art direction and some terrific episodic directors.  It all came together to create \\"magic.\\"<br /><br />The original concept was that the Captain, the FirstOfficer, and the Chief Engineer would be the three main characters.  However, this shifted as DeForrest Kelley as Dr. Leonard McCoy just caught fire with the audience and the production team.  Scotty was pushed back a bit, and McCoy rose to the forefront.<br /><br />Many view the original as so successful because it played to widely recognized psychological models...  with Kirk as the \\"superego\\" (the deciding factor element of the brain in psychological theory), Spock as the \\"ego\\" (the purely intellectual, \\"higher\\" element of the mind) and McCoy as the ID (the more instinctive, emotional elements of the mind).  Whether this was ever really intended...  it WORKED, and that's central to who these characters are and how they best served in the series.<br /><br />Star Trek, at its best, was always about us trying (and not always succeeding completely) to rise above our base natures.  It was HOPEFUL, but it was also real... these were real people, who we could imagine knowing in real life, but they were \\"us as we hope we might be, at our best.\\"<br /><br />SOme of the great lines in Classic Star Trek involved Kirk's morality.  Kirk refusing to kill the helpless Gorn commander, who had been trying to kill him...  and this is what proved to the keepers of the Arena that humanity had worth.  Kirk admitting that he's \\"a killer, from a race of killers... but I choose not to kill today\\" in another episode.<br /><br />Star Trek, classically, had a MESSAGE.  A message that, as flawed as we are, we can be better, and we can overcome, and we can survive, without giving up our humanity, and without giving into our baser nature.<br /><br />That... not the general shape of the ships, or the color of the shirts, or the names of the characters...  is what made \\"Star Trek\\" special.  The latter series tried, and USUALLY succeeded, in adherence to that, but the overall quality of those latter series varied, widely.  Nevertheless, none of them ever attempted to \\"revise\\" the original concepts and ideals of Star Trek.<br /><br />Until JJ Abrams came along, that is.<br /><br />The first movie, in 2009, was widely enjoyed by audiences...  for being a \\"thrilling romp with awesome visuals.\\"  It performed better than other recent Trek films, and (in unadjusted-for-inflation dollars) was the highest-grossing movie in Trek history (adjusting for inflation gives different results, of course, but ST'09 remains among the top-earning Trek films made).<br /><br />But that first movie lost the nature of Star Trek which I loved.  They ignored (due, I assume, to utter ignorance of real-world protocols and, more importantly, the REASONS behind those protocols) military logic.  Putting a fresh cadet in charge of the fleet flagship, ignoring the likely tens of thousands of other serving officers with far, far more experience and qualifications?  Not likely.  Uhura getting aboard the Enterprise through \\"blackmail\\" due to her sleeping with her superior... that's why the real military has regulations making \\"fraternization\\" a criminal offense (subject to prison time) for the senior personnel involved.  They failed to understand what a singularity is...  they failed to understand anything related to interstellar distances, or even intra-stellar ones (seriously, Old Spock could SEE VULCAN DESTROYED from his vantage point, but his planet was not swallowed up by the same singularity???)<br /><br />Still, I could almost forgive all of that... the lack of logic, of thought behind choices, of the horrendously bad set and prop design...  if the CHARACTERIZATIONS HAD BEEN RIGHT.  But...  they were not.  These were characters who had the same names, and somewhat similar appearances, but who (for the most part) felt utterly unrelated to the characters as portrayed previously.<br /><br />Karl Urban's McCoy was the best of the bunch, in my opinion...  and Zachary Quinto, given the script he was fed, did a decent job as Spock.  Chris Pine was, in my view, badly miscast...  a decent actor, but his \\"Kirk\\" has nothing whatsoever to do with the Kirk I grew up with.  They created a new character, from whole cloth, and named him \\"Jim Kirk,\\" and expected us not to be bothered by the fact that he had nothing at all in common with the character we know.  As much of a fan as I am of Simon Pegg, I thought his \\"Scotty\\" was terrible...  like a bad Saturday Night Live parody.  I didn't mind John Cho as Sulu... he's a fine actor who I'm loving in \\"Sleepy Hollow\\"...  but I found the casting of Chekov and Uhura to be pretty poor, as neither actor had anything in common with the originals except for a partial skin-tone similarity in one case... and I'd been hoping that they'd hire an actual Russian actor and an actual African actress to play the roles.<br /><br />Still, in that first movie, they retained to a degree the central role of McCoy in the mix, at least.  But they ignored the philosophy of Star Trek...  it was just wall-to-wall \\"attitude, explosions, and pandering.\\"  And, of course, they seemed to be trying (way too hard, frankly) to put together \\"the original series status quo\\" in just a couple of hours.<br /><br />In the end, I really hated it, personally.  The first film left me feeling like I'd woken up in the morning, gone into my child's bedroom, and found a stranger in there, pretending to be my child...  except in mocking fashion, torturing my real child's beloved pets and so forth.  Like a mythological \\"changeling\\"... go look it up.<br /><br />Still, I tried to keep an open mind with respect to this second film.  Having \\"put all the pieces onto the board in the right order\\" in the first film, I had hopes that they'd treat the second film as a \\"classic Star Trek episode\\" as much as possible, relying on the structures and philosophies with the original series so successfully implemented.<br /><br />Sadly,I was disappointed at every turn.<br /><br />At least in this film they seem to have settled on a size and scale for the Enterprise... in the firstfilm, the size of the ship fluctuated wildly, from more than twice the length of the TNG ship (itself dwarfing the original-series ship) to just about 2x the size of the original-series ship, to one sequence showing it smaller than the original-series ship.  This time out, it seems that the \\"JJ-Prise\\" is something like 1.75 x the size of the original ship... but of course we get another \\"hugererererer\\" ship in this movie... which dwarfs the city of San Francisco (though at that size, its fall from orbit through the atmosphere at the speeds shown would have taken a seconds at most, not the minutes it showed on-screen).<br /><br />The characterizations were not improved in this film, with the exception of Chris Pine, who I THINK was trying (with little help from the script) to give us a Kirk who was at least somewhat reminiscent of the original.  Spock was terribly disserved... and the \\"soap opera\\" between lovers Spock and Uhura was really, really badly carried off.  McCoy was almost ignored...  because, apparently, JJ wants the \\"big three\\" to be Kirk, Spock, and Uhura.  Urban did his best, but he was given so little to do in this film that it was shocking, frankly.  Pegg's \\"Scotty\\" wasn't as badly \\"parody-ish\\" this time around... but he still doesn't seem to be portraying a character with anything at all to do with the character played by James Doohan... despite their putting in a \\"Scotty drinking\\" scene.  (Drinking doesn't make a character... CHARACTERIZATION does!)  Super-girl Uhura was, to me, just horrendously FORCED... JJ Abrams and team wanting to create a \\"feminist-friendly starlet character\\" in the film...  except that it really doesn't work.  While Zoe Saldana is a nice-looking girl and I'm sure is a decent actress... the role that this character is supposed to play in this world would not the \\"action hero\\" that JJ wants her to be.  He found every excuse in the book to send her along on the \\"action sequences\\" but all this really ended up showing is why, again, FRATERNIZATION IS A REALLY BAD THING in a military or paramilitary environment.<br /><br />The biggest secret re: this film, of course, was ...  KHAAAAAAAANNNN.  It was the secret which was never really a secret.  But, of course, they did their level best to make us not think it was Khan by casting an actor unrelated to either the original presentation of Khan or to the fictional-real-world nature of Khan, and having the actor playing the part show literally no common psychological or personality traits with the Khan we all know.  In other words...  why call him \\"Khan\\" if you're not going to make him even remotely similar to Khan as we know him?  I'd have bee happier if they'd left him with the \\"assumed name\\" he initially has in the film, and come up with some other reason for him to be a GOD.<br /><br />And that's what he was.  Khan, in the original series, was a man.  A man whose genetics had been improved through eugenics (laboratory-level selective breeding, NOT \\"genetic code rewriting\\" by the way!).  Stronger, faster, smarter... but still HUMAN...  just representing the pinnacle of what humanity might be...  say, the top 1% of today's strength, intellect, and so forth, all combined into a single person.<br /><br />But Khan in this film is MAGICAL, it seems.  His strength is akin to Clark Kent in uniform.  He's literally invulnerable to injury or damage (and has \\"magic blood\\" which, instead of consuming other genetically-dissimilar life, somehow can \\"cure anything that ails ya!\\" regardless of whether you a \\"superman,\\" a normal human, or a little round fuzzy lifeform from halfway across the galaxy with a totally unrelated genetic structure).  Heck, it can even bring the dead back to life!  And it'll only cost you $9.99... plus you get this set of Ginsu Knives!  (Yes, that's sarcasm... but that's exactly how I felt about this story as they showed that cheap \\"McGuffin\\" at the end.)<br /><br />Naturally, they have a massive uber-starship which dwarfs anything ever seen...  and yet can be operated by a crew of one.  (Question... if you only need one man to crew the ship... why have it be so big?  What's the point of the size of the ship in the first place?  Other than to be \\"kewlerererererer and hugererererererer\\" than even the JJ Enterprise, I mean?)  And this ship, with the help of this one \\"superman,\\" has somehow led to technological breakthroughs that the entire rest of a hundreds-of-trillions-strong population spread throughout the galaxy could never have thought of.  Again, see, it's cause \\"JJ's Khan is a GOD.\\"  It's faster, better, stronger, tougher...  and somehow, NOBODY IN THE CIVILIAN LEADERSHIP OF THE DEMOCRATICALLY-RUN UNITED FEDERATION OF PLANETS HAD ANY IDEA THAT THIS WAS BEING BUILT?  How, I wonder, did they fund this?  Girl scout cookie sales???  Who worked on it?  And is the JJ-verse press so totally controlled that nobody ever reported anything on any of this?  In other words...  is the JJ-Trek future really a fascist utopia?  Because, barring that, I fail to see any way that something like this makes any sense whatsoever.<br /><br />So...  we have this huge ship... and why?  Because \\"it'll look kewl crashing into the San Francisco Bay and wiping out half the bay.\\"  Again, a real issue of lack of understanding of science...  such a crash would not have just \\"left a groove\\" and knocked down downtown San Francisco... that much energy would have wiped out EVERYTHING.  The waves alone would have wiped out every city within many miles of the SF Bay.  The impact would fracture the San Andreas Fault, and anything still standing would be down in short order.  It made NO SENSE...  but it sure did make for a kewl CGI effect, didn't it?  (Crashing something the size of the TOS Enterprise would have been much more reasonable...  but you wouldn't get those kewl sequences of a tilted saucer \\"skating\\" through the San Francisco skyline, would you?)<br /><br />Okay...  so...  characterizations - BAD.  Plausibility (remember, SCIENCE FICTION is not the same as fantasy...  it projects from what we know, it doesn't contradict what we know!) - BAD.  Design - only the most minor of improvements from the first film (at least we got minimal exposure to the Pabst Brewery this time around, and the phasers seemed to be a LITTLE bit improved... at least they didn't do \\"product placement flippy shots\\" to try to sell toy phasers this time!) but still, overall - BAD.<br /><br />This is not to say that the film isn't entertaining...  but the entertainment value is based entirely upon the \\"spectacle\\" of it, not based upon anything remotely akin to \\"making the audience think.\\"  It's not impossible to do both in a film...  a movie like \\"The Island\\" from a couple of years back hit the \\"thinking\\" and the \\"outrageous action\\" targets equally well, for example...but this one, while a rousing success on the \\"visual spectacle\\" level, utterly fails on the \\"makes you think, and makes you care\\" level.<br /><br />And that second item - making you think, and making you care - is where Classic Star Trek was at its best.  Unfortunately, JJ Abrams and his team seem not to have a grasp of how to do that.<br /><br />Fortunately, it seems that Abrams will have minimal involvement in the next film...  at the very least, he won't be directing, anyway...  so it'll be interesting to watch and see how a new director may approach this property.  A new team, even one including elements of the team from the prior two films, could make that \\"magic spark\\" happen and so there's still a chance... slim, but still there... that the third film (and likely the last one with this cast and production team, I strongly suspect) might finally give us a \\"Star Trek film\\" which brings us the things that so many of us loved so much about the original show.  Not the costume design, not the set design or ship design, or prop design... though all of those could be much, much better... but the charcterization and writing... the direction and acting.<br /><br />There's hope for the future, but it's a slim hope.  This movie had \\"hope\\" too... and those hopes, for me at least, were totally dashed by this film.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I would recommend this book to teens and adults. Suzanne has a way of writing that literally makes me feel every emotion of the character. I feel her confusion as to who she truly loves,  her distrust of people in authority, her humanity toward the other tributes, her loyalty toward those she feels closest to. I couldn't put it down.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Fun game and annoyingly addictive! I even stopped playing it once and I'm back at it again. It's a mission every time to get the three stars!

0441172717|5.0|When I was 12 years old, my father gave me this book and told me to read it.  At the time, I would have rather spent my time playing video games.  I told him \\"no thanks\\".  He made a deal with me that he would buy me the newest video game if I could honestly tell him that I didn't like it.  Needless to say, I didn't make him buy me one.  This story showed me how much fun reading can be.  After reading hundreds of more books, this is still one of my favorites.  It is one of the greatest gifts my father has ever given to me, and I plan on passing this treasure to my son in a couple years.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|This was a fabulous read. I do not really c are for reading but these books had me wanting to know more about the mysterious characters. I couldn't put it down. I love how descriptive the writer is, making me feel as if I'm in the scene setting myself. However, her writing is so good that when I see an actor meant to play Christian in my mind I think &#34;no! That's not him!&#34; Or &#34;yes that's Christian!&#34; But sadly, in my opinion, I don't think Jamie Dornan is going to cut it for me. I may stick with the book so as not to ruin the fantastic Christian that has been written into my imagination.

B00FXRTWQ8|5.0|Good game.  If you like Fishdom you'll like Spooky Fishdom. It's the same game but has some Halloween type picture tiles and stuff to buy for your fish tanks.  Not sure how many levels there are because it doesn't show you what level you're on.  Fishdom shows you a number for the level you're on but Spooky Fishdom has a question mark where the number should be.  The description says lots of play so hopefully there are lots of levels.  Had some problems getting the zero cost version to work but no problems with this version.
B007A4SDCG|2.0|I read this book on the recommendation of an artist I admire. I did glean a few helpful ideas, but on the whole the book seemed short on true inspiration. My advice? Do what you love, skip this book.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|While a difficult topic, an ugly period of our history, we must always remember the brave slaves indomitable spirits.  This is their story, told by the author in with sensitivity and literary expertise.
B00F8OUBXE|5.0|The last few albums to me have been outstanding. This is just another one in that vein. It isn't Howe or Wayne but neither were the last few! The soul of Metal Church is there. Purchase without fear!
B006PGL7OQ|5.0|Don't bother sifting through the allegorical layers immediately following this film. Just soak in the characters, story, and the performances that delivered these effectively.<br /><br />This is the &#34;simple&#34; story of a man with dreams/visions of an impending storm. Each one intensifies, leading Curtis (Michael Shannon) to greater and greater depths as he copes with these premonitions. His actions take a tole on his family, his friends, and himself. We are treated to wonderful journey that explores just how far Curtis is willing to go to protect his family.<br /><br />Don't be fooled: Michael Shannon is the star, but his supporting company is just as terrific, including Jessica Chastain & Shea Wigham.<br /><br />Other reviews will offer a more detailed synopsis or a thorough analysis of the mental illness portrayed in the film.<br /><br />I just say don't get bogged down by the details and allegory too much. (There'll be plenty of time for that after the movie, as it doesn't easily leave your own mind.) Let your gut take over, and you will be treated to one of the most viscerally satisfying films in a long time.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Great app, works well.  Alarm clock died and I needed a replacement in a hurry.  This app did the trick.
B004WPYO4C|5.0|Say what you want to about the poorly written female characters and the overly dark material.<br /><br />The real gem here is the performance of David Thewlis. In particular, the dialogue with the night security guard provides some of the most engaging back and forth cinema has to offer.<br /><br />I don't really have an in-depth review to offer. I just wanted to contribute a 5-star rating while singing the praises of David Thewlis. Easily a career best performance.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|The Best Show on Television if you ask me.  Never a dull moment and the characters are perfectly cast. A must watch.
B00G32QIEG|1.0|I cannot believe 2 famous stars like this would stoop so low as to making this, could only take a 1/2 hour and turned off!!
