B00OLQB9Y0|4|My daughter loved this purse. She wore it for about 4 months but the strap broke. I guess that's expected for the price. I will probably reorder the purse because she loved it so much!
B0009XBX4U|2|We bought the blue \\"Active\\" carrier.  Once we opened it, it was by far more purple than blue.  It definitely isn't the same color of the photos.  That's the only reason for it's markdown in stars.  The design of the actual BabyBjorn Baby Carrier Active is excellent.  Definitely a five star design.  We returned the \\"blue\\" one and shopped a bit more.  We finally designed to get the \\"Synergy\\" design, which combines the ergonomic design of the \\"Active\\" and the breathability of the \\"Air\\" fabric.  Hope this helps you guys...
B00HOVSCQW|3|It's OK nice but it didn't come with the same material as the one on the pillow when purchased but it's doing the job
B003ES4SB2|4|This is a great carseat at the right price. It has alot of great features compared to the more expensive brand. You can definitely feel quality of the product. I just wish there are other frames out there that we can use for it. I tried two wave strollers with it and had a hard time inserting the carseat onto the the stroller. Anyone else with the same issue?
B0080D59BO|5|The name brand was enough to me, nobody recommend it to me, the fact that it's make by Fisher Price gives me the assurance that is a good quality product, it's safe and secure and if you take good care of it  you will have a booster until your child is ready to go to preschool, also the convenience of the back support and the straps to keep your baby secure and safe, plus the toys are cute, like I said my grandson just love it.
B00D8VA05S|3|The weight function only worked the first three times.  After that, it gave very high weights that were inaccurate, and now it only gives 0 lb 0 oz.  The temperature function still works well though.  and yes i did try resetting the tub and replacing the batteries; didn't help.
B004TS42F8|5|We've had this seat for over a year now, and still dearly love it. I didn't buy it cause it looked cool, I got it after hearing a great story about a roll over accident and the child was unhurt(small scratches only). I trust the seat, my child is small for his age, this seat makes him feel bigger, and not like a baby. He is 4 1/2 and is the size of a 2 yr old. He doesn't like to be called or treated like a baby, this seat has helped, and gave me the peace of mind that he is safe. Very easy to clean, he ate cheetos and got the armrests all \\"yucky\\" I used a baby wipe and the cloth wiped clean. I've taken the cover off an washed it, it came off and on very easy. I would buy this seat again for all the great features it has.
B00171WXII|4|A friend gave me this for a shower gift and I thought it was gross.  However, it is way more effective in getting the snot out of stuffy noses than the stupid bulb they give you at the hospital.  MY daughter doesn't like it though so now that she is older it's hard to get her to let me use it so that's why only 4 stars.  I've never gotten snot in my mouth and it's pretty easy to clean as long as you do it right away.
B00SZ5UGWO|5|I consider myself a bib expert at this point because my 10 month old is the drooliest babe I've ever seen! He has been drooling since he was a few months old. I am tired of all his cute outfits being covered up by bibs. I have bought other triangle bibs with cute patterns from other sellers, but they are a little too small. These ones are AWESOME! They are big and so cute and really absorbent. The top layer does get really wet quickly, but the underneath layer is so thick that the shirt under stays dry. Love these! Will be buying more from this company for sure.
B004DN3SUE|1|This company should not be allowed to sell on Amazon, they are ruining Amazon's good reputation. I purchased this product on October 18th for my daughter's fourth birthday and the tracking info said that it has been sent via FedEx. On November 5th, the day before my daughter's birthday, I emailed them asking for the tracking info. Today, on her birthday, they sent a message saying that they were refunding my money. I don't want my money, I want my child's birthday present. According to the rep I spoke to at Amazon, their excuse was that they weren't able to ship it. Shouldn't they have figured that out three weeks ago!?! I hope these people are banned from Amazon. How dare you take someone's money and say that their product is on its way and then not even send it!!!
B00L96QVSE|5|this is very good
B001T7TN2E|5|This was one on my baby's first favorite toys. It was easy for him to grasp and hold, and he loves chewing on the soft rubber. As he has gotten a little older he still enjoys holding and chewing on this toy but now likes making it squeak.
B000ICZ9Y2|5|Good packing and good for my baby teeth.... recommended for parent to buy this. can chill it too, baby loving it
B0000798L0|5|I bought this after my wife and I were experiencing discomfort from kneeling or sitting next to the tub while giving a bath to our son.  It is the perfect height for sitting beside the tub helping with a bath.  It also opens to allow for storage of toys or other bath related items.  It is adjustable to two different heights and looks nice in our bathroom.  I would highly recommend to any parents of young ones who need help in the tub.
B004VLZI38|4|There are thin but adorable. Worked very well to send out to the ladies who came to my bridal shower.
B002ZG7JTM|5|Fantastic mattress that has stood up to two years of use. Still very firm. So happy with our purchase!
B0056QLQVA|4|This crib arrived with no bumps or brusies. Very strudy, and looks just like the picture. Ready for baby this Jan. :)
B006OKS994|4|This seat was perfect for my oldest boy.  He is not quite tall enough to sit in normal chair and needed this exact height.
B0077M41TU|5|Bought this to give to my granddaughter for Christmas. She loves her bath time and likes playing with all her toys.
B004LVJNAC|5|I pumped to donate and loved having this bigger bottle so I didn't have to stop half way through
B00J3YZVKI|5|The flow is much better for our 11 month old baby.
B00KJLCNDC|5|This thing is huge. It holds all of my niece's stuffed animals and then some.
B00LYQ53OC|5|If you use a jar of cream instead of paste type cream, this is the best thing to use it, that way you keep your hands clean and are able to reach better in-between the cheeks. would recommend to any one using a jar.
B00007H1YR|2|after reading some reviews I thought this would be a good monitor. but the problem is the static. the only way not to hear the static is if you lower the volume to the lowest. I'll be returning it and might try a cheaper model.
B00B3G8UGQ|5|Upon realizing that this product was not a joke, I was disheartened by the state of our society. Yet, the reviews of this product have restored my faith in humanity. Bless you good reviewers.
B002HOQOMA|3|&#34;Large&#34; is a gross overestimate. These bags hold about 3 diapers, and that is pushing it. They are functional, but not what I thought I was getting
B0075M5H90|5|This changing pad is so cute and matches perfectly with our son's room. It's also very soft.  We purchased two of these so that when one is being washed we have another to put on the pad.
B003S3R6DA|4|We got this crib/changing table combo for our second child. He's not here yet but it seems to be really sturdy. It took my husband and I around 30-45 minutes to put together. The only thing I was worried about was the shipping. When we got the box it was really beat up and I thought there were going to be scratches all over the paint. There weren't but just be careful and check. Overall, we are very satisfied with this purchase (especially the price!).
B002RSWEW0|5|This bottle is perfect for trips to the park or out and about. We put water in it and then she always has something to drink that I dont have to worry about spoiling
B002HMC2B4|1|I bought this one 2 years ago. And today it just felt apart. This is piece of trash. now I wasted $80 and cant get any replacement.
B00AJSIU6O|5|My son loves his new seat!  Says it's very comfortable.  It's lightweight and easy for him to get in and out of.
B00G1D44GQ|5|so cute, great gift, arrived very quickly
B004044LD4|5|This is really the perfect mattress. Our second son is almost 3 months old and not in the crib yet; however we knew we needed to replace the mattress his big brother well used for over 2 years. Not only is this mattress a better fit in the crib, it is firm (very important to me for safe sleep), and also durable looking. For the cost, I would recommend to anyone!
B003VQRJAO|4|These are just as cute as pictured and look great on the shelf, I also think baby will enjoy them when he or she arrives since they have a gentle rattle inside. I did feel like they were a splurge for what they are, but I couldn't resist them, and since we plan on getting some of the other Apple Park items (monkey variety) I decided to pick these up. Overall, I'm pleased!
B003KFCV6S|5|I've tried side bars before on my toddler's bed and became frustrated with not being able to make the bed very well, the bars not folding down as they are supposed to etc...<br /><br />These bumpers work so simply and so perfectly!  Light weight and can be easily taken with the child to a relatives house or on vacation.<br /><br />With lots of climbing on the bed they may need to be repositioned but usually are fine and I only have to fix them once or twice a week which is easy to do since they rest right under the fitted sheet.  We did pick up a slightly deeper fitted sheet on clearance so that the sheet would not fit taunt over them, works well and my son feels snug.  I can lean right on them while reading next to him during story time before bed instead of being cramped next to a toddler bed or fighting with a bar.
B005JDOYF0|5|This stroller is easy to assemble, light and easy to move around.  Getting it folded/unfolded is also very easy.  I've seen people fighting to figure out how to work their strollers, but this one won't give you those problems.  Simply fold the main handle down using the two side buttons and then lift smaller, second handle to fold/unfold.  While folded, the stroller doesn't take up much room and can stand upright on its own. Once unfolded, the car seat drops right in and snaps easily.
B0056S8EBS|5|We wanted to get a couple of the \\"baby on board\\" signs for our vehicles and the Disney ones were nice versions of the boring basic ones.  We got this one for my car and the 'Cars' version for my husband's vehicle.  And the quality was what would be expected.
B00A0F2Q7K|5|Super cute! My sister is going go to love them when I gift them to her for her baby shower.
B007ZZCS44|5|This is adorable! Had it put together in about 10 minutes and it had my finicky co sleeping toddler sleeping in her big girl bed the first night!
B002BY2LF0|5|My 2 month old takes them and I am happy knowing my baby has a natural-material product in her mouth. I only use the pacifier to help me in the car because I don't want to hear her wail.<br /><br />Anyway, spend the extra bucks and avoid plastic and synthetics!<br /><br />I sterilize by 5 min in boiling water ;)
B002UD65GI|5|We have 4 of these because our little one keeps 1 at school and a few at home. They are so soft and his absolute favorite blanket. Over time it does lose some of its softness on the blue side.
B003554H9M|4|I had to write this review after I saw that the last couple of reviews had been pretty bad for this product given that I believe the contrary.<br /><br />First some context: I am a father of two and owner of 3 strollers and 3 car seats. I travel with my wife and daughters between 3-4 times a year. I have purchase other bags for the purpose of covering my strollers and car seats in the past but have now settled with this &#34;gate check&#34; bag.<br /><br />As parents know, traveling with small children requires patience and a lot of stuff. Having something that protects your stuff is key if you want to use it more than once. For that reason I have purchased a bag for each of my strollers and car seat that I used when traveling on a plane. It is cleared to me that if you don't use a bag your stuff will get damage or dirty easily.<br /><br />If you have an expensive stroller or car seat and want to keep it intact you probably need to buy the brand's hard bag. No need to lie here. This bag is great for its intended purpose but it is still made from normal threads so if you want bullet-proof material, don't think that this one will stand to your expectations.<br /><br />This bag is great to keep your normal stroller clean and it would protect it from its normal wear and tear. It won't protect it from a clumsy or awful bag taker. The only way you are going to be saved from those people is having a hard bag but that it is impossible when you are gate checking. In others words this is as good as you get for gate checking bags.<br /><br />In terms of fitting well, check the right size for your stroller and car seat. There is a bag for each purpose. I have purchased the umbrella stroller size and it fit perfectly for my Uppa Baby stroller. I have another umbrella stroller that I just purchased for my youngest and it also fit that one pretty well. Sorry cant remember that brand of stroller right now but it is something like &#34;first something&#34;. For my car seats I have athree Graccos. One is a infant car seat and the other two are toddlers car seat. In the three occasions I purchased the &#34;car seat&#34; sized bag and it worked perfectly.<br /><br />I have to say that I have had bad flights were they teared my bag but those are more the exemption to the rule. In general what happens normally in a flight is that the bag will get really dirty. Just washed afterwardsw and that is it.<br /><br />In terms of how easy is to storage it I will have to say that it doesn't required for you to be a scientist to get the entire bag back into the small self-contained bag. What I do is that I keep it in the stroller all the time after folding it back.  That way I don't search for the bag when I am traveling.<br /><br />In terms of putting strollers or car seats in the bag when at the gate. My rutile is pretty simple. I normally go first and leave my wife and daughters at the door of the plane. I leave the bags in our seats and go back to the door. Then I fold and bagged strollers and enter the plane with my wife. Putting the strollers in their respective bags is relatively easy. If you purchased the right size it should be that problematic. It take me a few seconds as I already got all the tricks.<br /><br />I hope this review helped you.
B0055R6AYS|4|After paying so much for a stroller, you want to make sure it doesn't get ripped apart when traveling. We bought the travel bag for both the G series and the Vista. Nice thing to add to your registry.
B009S2GRDA|5|While this carrier is not one size fits all, making it hard for multiple family members to use, it is the easiest to use! Bought it in multiple colors!!
B00GLFQLMO|5|Very good product
B00BY5OKHO|5|Durable and cute.  My granddaughter likes all her food separated so these are perfect!
B004FN0Z44|5|I am entirely happy with this product. I tend to always carry it in the boot of my car -- so it helps that the stroller is very light & folds up neatly into a really small size. It is somewhat basic in functionality, but if basic is what you are looking for -- then I would strongly recommend it. Great value for money!
B00IGLB53G|4|Shipping took quite a while. The lighting makes the image looks like its grey in color but actual product is white. A decent wet/dry bag however.
B00021NX8S|5|Amazing! Life saver! my daughter plays in there all day and it frees me up to do things around the house. Very durable and safe. I love it! Highly recommend for any parent.
B00171WXII|5|This product works great and is easy to clean.
B000QJYK6U|5|I wear one of these myself every morning while reading the morning newspaper, just in case I'm careless enough to read the political news; very comforting knowing I have protection against loss of bladder control every time I read that Congress has done something stupid, again.
B0039UULYS|4|I just made my 4 week old son's foot & hand print to cherish for years to come! The kit comes with everything you need, although I would've liked to have 2 ink pads instead of 1. After doing his hand print, there was less ink to get a good foot print. It was great, though, that the ink itself never came into contact with my baby's skin. All in all, a good, high quality keepsake kit!
B008RMGIRW|1|When I received the product it was broken. Was not able to use it. Then tried to replace it but it was not an option because Amazon was out if stock. Not a good experience!
B00DEI6MMU|3|After reading the reviews, I was so excited to get this for my newborn. We brought him home from the hospital and thought we would use this as his bassinet while he was in our room. After about 10 minutes in this we had to try and somehow get the head of the puppy tucked up and away from his face. The puppy face triggered his rooting reflex with the fur brushing against his cheek. It drove him crazy. If I were to buy it again, I would buy one that didn't have the fancy, furry stuff, but rather just the simple one. We do like that we can easily rock it to calm him, and the vibrating feature.
B0034G61DC|5|One of the best investments for our son. The mat is big, colorful and interactive. Gives a bit I an extra cushion for their little biddies in case the fall during play.
B0012J5GW0|4|[[ASIN:B0012J5GW0 Graco IPO Stroller in Soho]]    After a lot of searching for a lightweight stroller with big stroller amenities, I chose the Graco IPO. . it arrived very quickly, had very little assembly, and I am very pleased with it!  It folds compactly like an umbrella stroller, but the handles are much taller and I am not kicking the wheels or hunched over trying to push it!  I love the reclining seat and nice sized canopy. . .The storage basket is on the small side, but big enough for necessities. . .the only thing I am missing is the cup holders, but I have seen several after market add ons to solve this problem. . .I have three kids and would definitely recommend this product!  It accomodates up to 50 pounds so you are definitely getting plenty of bang for your buck!
B004GCJN6U|5|Worked great for my boy.  There is a cutout in the back bottom where you can fasten the straps together and hide the buckles under the chair.  Not a big deal, but was kind of satisfying to have them out of the way.  You don't have the buckles and extra strap dangling around which I liked more than I thought I would.  Held firmly in place.
B00GXISDXO|2|Works okay, not great for high wind or use in a car seat. I returned the product.
B00GCYTNYM|4|Ugly but functional.  I have to hold it tight over the front of the head, but no water leaks through onto my LO's face.  Works well.
B00EAZ7YI2|3|it's a nice bottle. A glass insert to hold the actual milk with a plastic holder to protect (i'm assuming) from breakage.  I brought only one for baby, just to try it out. Seems like a good idea at the time because,well,glass breaks. The rest of her bottles  are glass  Lifestyles brand and Dr Brown's natural flow bottles.  The nipples on Lifestyles and Dr Brown's are interchangeable (pro). Anyway having glass bottles and being clumsy myself, I found that the above mentioned brand of  glass bottles didn't break. Not saying that they won't break, (they might so be careful) just saying that one can make duo and just get glass bottles and call it a day.   Especially if you going to have to pay a little over 13 dollars per bottle like 5 phases brand.   Just know you don't need a plastic covering for any glass bottle.  If you're that concerned about breakage then buy plastic bottles.   If you're concerned about the safety of plastic (which I'm sure why you're even considering this) then just attempt to handle your glass bottles with care. It will be okay. As far as daycare excepting glass? Some will, some won' . For the ones that do not accept glass...this may not soothe them because there is still a glass breakage problem with the insert.    Beyond all that,  the baby was fine using it, she's not real fussy about nipple types though.  The cap is a struggle to get off ( if you care about that sort of thing), but that's a good thing with leaks and all.  if you don't center the top over the insert right then it will leak inside the bottle and not come out the nipple properly.  You'll have liquid in that green part...it's mildly annoying.  The design is cute.    Buy it if you must, the pros just aren't worth it in my opinion.  hope this review helped.
B009A5RZD6|4|These chime birds make the most wonderfully melodic sounds, really quite beautiful and completely non-objectionable as compared to many other baby toys.  Babies love these...well, at least my daughter and her cousin too (received these at about 6 months and she still loved them, probably would have loved them sooner too).  Now she is almost 10 months old and still likes to give the little birdie legs a tug to hear the chimes.  We actually never used these in her car seat, because the first time we did, the toy is so long that it can swing and hit her in the face when loading the car seat into and out of the car.  They are soft, so not a huge big deal, but still did not want something long enough to bump her face.  But she loves the sounds of the chimes so much that we use them around the house and play inside with them.  It's fun for Mommy or Daddy to hold the tether end and baby to pull on the legs or bat at the body to hear the soothing chime jingling sounds.  Babies love these so much...the only reason 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the length of the toy and how it really can't be used in a car seat without hanging down to bump baby's head when moving the car seat.
B00008439C|3|First of all, I don't think this unit was new... the cord had definitely been extended and then repacked. If it's not new (never used) say so please.<br /><br />It arrived on time, but was in a box that was bigger than the package but nothing else was in it so the box bumped around inside the outer box. When I picked it up, the inner box shifted and the thing started whooshing in demo mode. Probably needed some extra padding in the box.<br /><br />I really should have heeded the previous reviews. It CANNOT be used without being plugged in. The batteries are for demo only. Sounds play for 10 seconds then stop in demo mode.<br /><br />Other than that it's ok. Not very loud, but would suffice in my normally quiet house.<br /><br />I do like the modes. My old sound machine always had rain and thunder combined and summer nights were full of randomly screeching animals and bugs. I find that creepy, so the fact that this one can have rain without thunder, ocean without gulls, etc., is nice. It's also well made, solid, and has a nice long cord....which must be plugged in :\<br /><br />I'm considering returning it. It's still in the box, not being used. It was cheaper than most, so I may keep it anyway.
B002GE73WQ|4|Purchase this because my 6 yrs old loves LPS. A little small though but it fit the lps thermos and the bottle that i also purchase. My daughter likes it!
B000W7GQA4|2|The pillow felt flattened from the time I opened the package. I can't imagine what it would feel like after months of use. After one night, I am returning it, because it just isn't supporting me (which is not a rave review as I'm early in my 2nd trimester!). I wouldn't recommend this product- it doesn't live up to the Boppy name.
B00GJG8SMQ|5|Baby sleeps... like a baby!
B000WHOU1G|5|I received several lovey's for my newborn son and this was the only one he took to! Not too much fluff, very soft, no extra dangly attachments. When he was a newborn he would suck on the corners of the lovey, and now that he's 6 months old he sucks/chews on the ears and head, and also balls it up into his face and bites it to soothe during sleep. He also uses it as a pillow - he roll onto his belly, ball it up underneath his head and lay on it. It's easy to throw in the wash and it's been a LIFESAVER with sleep training - since he won't and hasn't ever taken a PACIFIER, this is our go-to for nighttime comfort. A good friend who gave this to us said she gifts it to all her friends who are having babies - I plan on continuing the trend!
B000LSL5ZK|5|soft spoons. baby has not used them yet but we've used them a few times and they work great. good grip.
B000HAU6U2|4|I got 2 of these for my 15 month old twins.  They are very well made with nice covers you can remove for washing.  They are however, very firm.  They are not like bean bags.  I have had them a few days and so far my girls have not warmed up to using them, I think because they are so firm.  I am keeping them though because they are well made, probably safer than bean bags and I am hoping that they will get used to them.
B006567YW0|4|I wanted a high chair for my grandson that would work around the dining room table. The walnut wood finish is very nice and fits the table well. It was easy to put together.
B000056OV0|5|We love this bath tub!  We had the First Year convertible bath tub first...horrible.  Our son slipped all over the place and you could not get all areas cleaned because of the set up of the tub.  We love the Euro Bath!  It is large enough for baby to have splash and play time without worrying about them slipping.  I love the fact that our son can continue to grow with this tub!  Don't worry about buying anything else!!!!
B003TJAGCQ|4|I have no idea what I would have done without this car adapter.  I gave birth a month before my school ended and had to pump in my car during school hours and sometimes before/after work and clinical.  Having a power source in my car for my Purely Yours breast pump made things so much easier.  The only con I found was the insides rattled around a bit and it actually came apart once.  Luckily the parts stayed in the box so I was able to put it back together.  Overall, it was worth its weight in gold when I needed it!
B006VRX78I|5|love it
B0070WGV9K|4|This was easy to put together and easy to put on my toddlers twin bed, the only reason I didn't give it five stars is because the straps that lock down to keep it from sliding out don't lock down very tight and occasionally I have to tighten it and adjust it.<br /><br />It is a great product but could use a slight improvement so that the straps stay tight after it's put on so that you don't have to adjust them so often. Overall though, even with that minor issue I would still buy it again if I needed another one, so don't let that stop you from buying this if you have a toddler that you are worried about falling out of a bed.
B00LYCR718|5|Great item.
B001GHZ2L8|5|this is a great product, fast shipping and recieved it very quickly.  Our 3 year old loves using this for all the light switches she can't reach.
B000SMWUPS|4|we have an UppaBaby Vista which does not have come with a beverage holder. The UppaBaby branded one is over $20, which seems overpriced to me. I found this on amazon for under $10 and it has been a great buy. We use it to hold a water bottle, hand sanitizer, burp cloths, my wife's wallet, keys, etc. Very handy and improved on the one area that the Vista was lacking. People have actually come up to us in our local baby store and asked where we got it since they were also about to buy the Vista. Totally worth the price and very very useful. The velcro straps make it adjustable to just about any handle. Highly reccomend.
B005C9ODQ6|4|I bought one of these to try out because of the reasonable price, and because our Ergo was not working for my 2 month/13#/25&#34; baby as well as planned. Here is what I like about the mei tai vs the Ergo:<br /><br />-Taller panel gives him head support - he likes to tilt his head back and look around and with the ergo I have to hold it with one hand since he is still a little wobbly. This lets him just rest it against the support and still look around. This won't be a problem once he has better head control but the ergo is definitely too short for now.<br />-Easier to put on - it's always difficult for me to clip the shoulder strap when I have the ergo on alone<br />-Price is definitely a plus! Especially if you are new to babywearing and are not sure which one you might like.<br />-More lightweight than the canvas for the ergo<br />-The sides of the panel are padded, so he is comfortable with his legs out even at this relatively small age. In the ergo he is too big for the infant insert but too small to have his legs comfortably out.<br /><br />Some might find the Ergo easier to adjust (you can just pull straps vs tying and untying) and it definitely is sturdier. So far I have not tested out either on very long walks.
B00D4XZO2E|5|I love that it reclines<br />I love that its comfortable  due to the padded seat<br />Love the carry strap<br />and its light weight you can fold with one hand.<br /><br />This stroller is perfect for me and my baby, it has all the features I was looking for. I was so happy when I open the box,  easy to install. I  love it, thanks Summer Infant :)
B004S8MGGQ|5|I bought this bra so I could use it when I'm pumping at work.  It is great nice and snug it holds every thing in.  I also use it at home I love that it is really hands free.  I highly recommend this bra.
B003OEDYCA|3|Reminds me of a dog toy.  Some people hate it, some people think it's funny.  The kid is occasionally interested in it.
B0055FVIJC|1|These don't show up well on any surface, color bleaches out if they sit in water.
B00BH0P8FO|5|we have had these already, but we ordered another two sets, work great for the kids., little to no spilling or leaks.
B00XHBCIS6|4|These work great - I haven't had any issues with them leaking through, even when I wake up soaked (on the other side). The price is great too because many others cost the same and give you less pairs - with these I'm able to last the whole week before needed to wash the set. The reason I'm giving them only 4 stars is because of the shape - the pads don't have a seam or crease, so the circle just bunches up in my bra and can look lumpy if positioned wrong (of course this wouldn't be an issue if they're only used at night). I was using disposable pads before these - what a waste of money!
B00125NZSQ|5|The cover fits over our Britax Marathon and our Graco car seat. It folds up nicely and the quality is pretty good for the price. It gets the job done and our car seats are no longer scorching hot
B0028IDXDS|5|baby loves it
B0034ZUC74|5|My husband and I did alot of researching on carseats and kept coming back to this one. We are so happy we went this the Maxi Cosi and so is our son.
B00IZUJGTS|5|My grandson likes it and my daughter likes it. It has so many options that you'd may not ever use them all but each baby is different and will like something different about the roller. I was a bit worried about paying around $100.00 for a plastic roller but after putting ti together I can say it is worth it. After seeing my grandson enjoy himself in it I was pleased.
B002R277AA|5|It's a beautiful necklace, would never know it was a teething ring! My baby loves to chew on it, really feels good on his achy gums.
B005ZNCDKM|1|Very bully. Didnt wrap around my table and form close enough to the wood. Would be better on a round table.
B003U7KH0S|5|I just could not resist buying this onsie for my friend's new born son. The design is simple, but adorable! The print was clear and well done.
B003KN27BY|4|Eliminates the need for a bulky coat. Very cozy and warm. Consider this if your baby is born during the winter months for trips between house and car or quick trips outside.
B00U6WUR0A|5|This is a great little pillow! It's such a great size for my son. I've bought a ton of stuff on Amazon and this is the first time I've gotten a personal email follow up making sure everything was alright.
B00AJF7S74|5|So cute and beautiful lullaby/Christian song!
B004LWZZ76|5|My daughter loves to put these in her mouth.<br />Plus they have been a good way to introduce her to water running over her head!<br />She used to hate that, but now it's a game with these toys.
B0035ER4WU|5|These are nice to use. Good size for kids
B004XEBZDK|5|I bought this product because I have twins and their food jars were taking over my cupboard space. I live in an old home with very little cupboard space to begin with. The organizer keeps the food in one location and saves me so much space. I also haven't dropped a jar since getting it (fingers crossed). I should have bought two. I saw on the PRK website that they also make a bottle organizer. That might be even more helpful.
B000056JJB|4|I love this item. I agree the colors are loud but my babies seem to love seeing their little friends at meal time. I fixed the loud colors problem and put the Sesame Street mat in their playroom and am using the softer winnie the Pooh version. I love that its easy to clean, teaches them colors and numbers. The only thing is like the others above I wish it was bigger
B003D3NW6U|4|I needed thin delicate wash clothes to wash my newborn's face. These fit the bill. They do curl up after being washed the first time. The toy included is a joke, total garbage, threw it away upon opening. But the wash clothes are decent, especially for the price. Recommend them.
B000066CMV|5|I bought this for my wife, and she said it is the best. So I am telling everyone that this pump is the best.
B0045I6IA4|5|Great
B00KGLJ1RG|5|Good back seat mirror.  Works good.
B004GCJMLG|4|These work great. Got these for my granddaughter's visit.  They were a bit of a task to install, but love the feature that you can &#34;de-magnetize&#34; them to work like normal cabinets when the little ones aren't around.
B00CXVI4M0|5|I love this car shade, but I wish in came as a 2-pack like most other shades. This is replacing the Munchkin brand with suction cups - awful.  Every time I shut the car door it would fly onto the floor.  Then I would worry about the cups losing suction and falling off the window onto my baby's head while I was driving.  Installation on an 09 Rogue took all of 5 seconds.  No repeatedly cleaning windows and smashing suction cups.  I haven't tried to roll down the window yet, but then again, I'm not sure why you would want to roll down the window if you have your infant sitting there.
B001UF8BL4|3|Bought it because of the reviews, but my 5 month old son is relatively uninterested in it b/c he can't get his mouth on it to chew or suck on anything.
B005PK1CPM|5|My daughter loves it
B000YDDF6O|5|My grandson loves the toy.
B006PB2FX8|3|This chair is easy to fold/store and easy to take to grandparent's house. However, the back of the chair leans back too much. My 12 month old seems to lean over to one side, lounging instead of sitting straight up. I do like the removable pink tray as that makes it easy to clean. The fabric wipes off easily too and there are cracks between the seat and the sides/back of the chair so food crumbs easily fall through to the floor which makes my dogs happy.
B00AJFTEWQ|5|highly recommend this! much better than huggies and pampers. worth the money!
B00E401FVU|5|Super cute and made very well! Going to be using it for more than just a wet bag! =)
B0016ZON3S|4|It is as soft as can be and brought a huge smile to my wife
B000T8LTB2|5|We loved this chair so much when our kids were little, we purchased one for my brother and new wife. It is so easy to take anywhere.
B009Z4WJ1K|3|I wish there was a way to attach the colored flags to the whale, baby loves the toy but I don't know how long before the flags are long gone
B0067DBTR2|5|This is a good size, worked great.  Adhered to textured wall with no problems.  Easy to put up and move around!
B000MSVNME|4|We received the main set from our baby register.  Our twins slept for the first 6 months in one crib.  We have just separated them and bought a spare camera for the second crib.  It works really well.  The only reason I have given a 4 instead of a 5 is that I have noticed a bit more static.    A must for parents of twins
B000058DQJ|2|I ordered these thinking they were the shields that go on a breast pump horn. I was wrong. Not sure what to do with these now.
B004OR1DUG|3|It's ok, but not something I would buy again. My toddler never really took to the shape of the spout, and so wouldn't drink from them.
B00GQQVNP8|5|I am a big fan of leggings.  These keep me warm in the winter on a bitter cold day.  I have been purchasing leggings ever since I have been on amazon.  I love their style of leggings that you can't find in stores.
B006SFUEF2|5|My baby loves this thing. He went through a phase where he would only sleep in his swing and I found that it was because of the ocean sounds on it. I put an app on my phone and would play it during nap time for him and he loved it, he would sleep so soundly. Finally I came across this machine and it has lots of bells and whistles for a great price. I don't even use all the stuff it has to offer but for the price you could't beat it, love it.
B00F9Q3FQG|5|Fortunately, haven't had to test the safety, but I like the ease of use... moving it between cars and strapping my kid in. It has big easy buttons to unlock it from the car and it has some velcro on the sides to hold the straps to the side when putting children in. Would buy again if i have to.
B00GS153GQ|5|Just what my great nephew needed!
B00DMCYENW|5|This was one of our best buys, we used it just as a bassinet when the bub was little and also as a travel cot for visiting family. It took a couple of times to get used to packing it up and getting it out again, but once we knew how we could get it up and down in 5 mins.
B00ZICEJJI|5|This is not the typical kind of nylon bag which we get in market. This is good quality polyester bag 90% nylon and 10% polypropylene. Quiet spacious for storing all types of umbrella strollers! Very easy to carry as it has got a proper handle and so transporting it is much convenient and hassle free.
B002O3JH9Q|4|I'm not sure how often you are supposed to replace these.  We used Lifefactory bottles from the minute our son came home from the hospital.  We usually went up a stage in the nipple every 3 months when he seemed to need different flow.  Have had the stage 3 for five months now and I've noticed in past few weeks that the nipples come out of the dishwasher kind of cloudy.  I think he probably needs another set.  Otherwise, these have been great.  He has used them daily and they come out of the wash fine.  He actually does not like any other bottle nipple!
B00F2MQDU2|5|I have twin boys that are currently 3.5 months old. They love playing on this toy side by side. The piano has two modes: the first plays a short ditty when they kick a key, the second plays continuously for several minutes when they kick a key. The dangling toys are really interesting to my kids. They'll play with this toy for quite a while before getting bored. I always put a blanket down on the mat before I put the kids on it because they drool/spit up pretty often and it's easier to wash a blanket and replace it than wash the mat.
B00005YYE4|5|This is a must for moms who are nursing their babies.  It is so easy for feedings.  This pillow is also really helpful for the little cousins who want to hold the new baby but are to small.  The baby is supported by the pillow and the little child really enjoys holding the baby.  A must have!
B00D4XZO2E|5|Great for travel and it was so hard to find a lite stroller that fully reclined. It was great for napping and a makeshift changing table.
B001GHZ2L8|4|We have these in every room of our house and it is so nice to be able to send our 2 and 4 year olds into another room to grab a toy or to go potty without having to stop cooking supper or whatever the task is at hand!  We also installed one in the hallway incase it is dark, they can turn that one on first and then see the switch in their bedrooms - makes for a non-scary trip! Definitely recommend!
B004PYD2OI|3|I originally purchased one of these clippers and I was very impressed. I decided to buy two more to keep in various places (like the diaper bag). Out of the three that I own, one is nice and sharp and clips nails well, one is very dull and barely works at all, and the third clips alright, but isn't the greatest.<br />These are good clippers if you get one that works.
B00PTK9FDE|3|So at first I had a lot of trouble getting the suction cups to stick on, they would fall off in 5 mins - 1 hour after sticking.  However I stuck them on about 2 weeks ago with just a bit of Silva on the cups and they have stayed on since then.<br /><br />When I received the shade one of the cups was terribly bent up but I just dropped it in hot water (not boiling but microwaved for 1 minute) for ~ 30 seconds then pulled it out and stuck it on the window to reform it<br /><br />It doesn't fully cover the read window of my 2009 Hyundai Elantra but it keeps most of the sun of my son's face and does a better job than me driving with newspaper or something in front of him<br /><br />Overall it is currently working for me, I'm not thrilled with it but I don't want to return it
B00AM5NTIS|3|I asked for and received these as a Christmas 2012 gift for my toddler.  I was excited to use them right away since their size and design appeared to be great.  Once I got them, I used them once a week (minus summers) while my toddler went to a Mother's Morning Out program.  Over the course of 11 months, our last and final Little Green Pouch has broken, and in the exact same way as the previous three.  The ziplock-bag-type closure is difficult to open because the &#34;snap&#34; is so secure.  Well, you would think that's a good feature, except for the fact that the side of the bag and the closure strip do not have a strong bond.  So what happens is the ziplock-type bond stays clasped, yet the ziplock part attached to the side of the bag pulls apart.  This leaves the bag unusable since there is now no way to completely close the top of the bag.  I know the product is new, and I hope they come out with a better version.
B005SPFFPW|1|I've owned this carrier for about 3 months now, used every day with my baby and just loved it! Sturdy canvas construction, comfortable waist and shoulder straps, easy adjustability, nice hood to cover from sun or wind. Honestly, this carrier had all that I needed. Very comfortable, I carried my baby in it for hours at a time, and she just slept through it!<br /><br />But today the worst babywearer's nightmare happened - the chest strap came right off when I was strapping in my baby. Luckily, she did not fall, I was able to catch her. I can no longer use the carrier, because chest strap holds the whole carrier together on your shoulders. I love this carrier so much that I am tempted to just ask for an exchange, but just no longer trust the brand - I think this really is a design flaw not just a single defect. The chest strap is designed to slide easily in a piping to accommodate different heights and postures, and when it got to the end of the piping, it just slid straight off. Scary!
B004I8VDT2|3|The print is very cute.  I like the colors .  it's very hard to get onto the bed , it's very tight.  the fabric is very thin
B000GEM38W|4|I'm not in love with this crib, but it's practical, sturdy, goes well with the decor of the nursery, and was a breeze to assemble. Most of the items associated with having a baby were very hard to assemble, this was cake. We love that it grows with the baby, and I'm confident that it will hold up for years to come, it's very stable. I highly recommend this brand of product as most of what we got was Storkcraft, which I think is garbage.
B005RCLQN6|5|Great rocker!!  We were looking for something for my father in law in the nursing center that would be easy for him to get out of without falling and would be easy to keep clean.  This chair is very comfortable and is very pleasing to the eye.  It stops rocking immediately when you stand up so it doesn't knock him down.
B002Q398P2|2|Wrong colors...have to return it!
B00KPEAFTC|3|This necklace is very cute and well made. I was very satisfied with it , however after almost 2 months of use and it unfortunately has not made a difference with my sons teething discomfort. I will be attempting to contact the seller to see if indeed we are able to get a refund for this product and will update this review accordingly
B00008439C|5|Not just for babies! If you have trouble sleeping or are a light sleeper, this is a great product. It has a lot of options for sounds that you can even mix and match. The fact that it comes with a timer so you do not have to have it running all night is a great energy saver.
B007CTPY1M|5|I spent days searching the Internet for a perfect stroller for my baby (budget under $400). At the end of my research I had 4 strollers in mind: 1. Britax B-Ready 2. Britax B-Agile 3. Baby Jogger City Mini 4. Baby Jogger City Select.<br />Then I went to the store that has all four in stock. Strollers 1 and 4 are very similar:<br />1. both convert to a double stroller (seat configurations are different)<br />2. both weigh over 25 lb<br />3. both have removable seat (can face u or out)<br />4. both have large canopy<br />5. BJ City Select can be used from birth (reclines flat) / Britax - from 6 months (I used it from 3 months)<br /><br />Strollers 2 and 3 are similar as well:<br />1. both are single strollers<br />2. both weigh less then 20 lb<br />3. seat is not removable (face out only)<br />4. both  have easy-fold feature<br />5. BJ City Mini has a metal bar between back wheels (I kick it constantly when walking)<br />6. both have large canopy<br /><br />I have chosen Britax B-Ready. It is a great stroller! It is soooooooooo big and heavy when folded, but I think it's he only minus and I am ok with it. Plus I got a free second seat for he next baby. Love it!<br />Unfortunately, because it is huge and heavy I don't take the stroller to the grocery stores so I could have enough space for groceries. I use baby carrier instead.
B00BFBUYCC|5|Just put it together and seems very sturdy, I think it will be very useful when my baby girl comes!
B0047EFNHU|4|This is what we were expeting in a diaper bag, enough space for bottles, cloth, toys and other, excellent compartment for food and cool colors.
B000YI3GMC|4|I'm still waiting on the arrival of the baby that will be sleeping on the bedding, but I have the crib made up and it is adorable. I put my one-year-old daughter in the crib just to test it out, and she loved the animal/flower print on the sheets. The quilt and bumper have both velvet and corduroy along with the regular cotton material, which I thought made it even more cute in person.  The sheet was kind of rough at first, but I washed it a few times and it is much softer now. My only complaint is that I wish the bright pink was red so that it would match my older daughter's bedding. I had trouble finding another set of bedding that used primary colors but was still girly, without having to do a character theme like Disney or Dr. Seuss.
B008RU6GXK|4|This bag is fairly sturdy and has all the compartments a girl could need!  I do not use this bag as a diaper bag, but as my go to travel bag.  It is perfect because it is water proof and has pockets galore for all those things I try to squeeze into a large purse.  This bag is large enough to carry your wallet or wristlet and have plenty of room for other items as well.  I did take the time to have a local tailor replace the zipper with one that is more sturdy because the one that comes on the bag is pretty cheap.  It's a shame that the manufacturers don't just invest on making these with a quality zipper from the get because I have zero complaints for this bag otherwise.  All in all I spent $35 (with the extra $10 to get the zipper replaced) for a durable, quality travel bag.  I am pretty pleased with this purchase.
B0085CBA90|5|I just bought these a few days ago and got them in them in the mail yesterday.  My nipples were so sore using the Medela flanges so I looked into getting these.  I am almost 100% hurt free after using these a half day yesterday and almost all day today.  They feel so amazing and I am getting 6 oz now compared to the 4 oz I used to get with my Medela ones.  I highly recommend these.
B002TJ0276|5|Loved it came in early was quit suprised how lovely the product matched would definitely recommend this client to every one
B000GGD3O8|5|We needed a top of stairs gate for visits from our grandkids. The top of our stairs are wider than normal at 43&#34; and the company's sizing chart made it easy to select the correct gate and extension for proper fit. Installation was relatively pain free. There was one problem that I think the company could easily correct in the documentation:  they need to fully explain the reasoning behind the latch slide and then lift opening procedure, although it becomes evident in a short while. This is so a child cannot easily open the gate itself. The gate is very solid and the self-closing mechanism works flawlessly as long it's installed plumb to the floor (I used a level for this).
B005IWM73S|5|My 2 week old sleeps in this sleeper during the night, right next to our bed. He doesn't make a peep all night. This is a wonderful product, very convenient and very comfortable. I love that this inclines, because I truly believe my son sleeps better that way. The sleep surface is soft and plush, but I still place something underneath my baby just in case he has an accident when sleeping. Plus, it gives him a little bit of a boost since he does look a bit scrunched up in it sometime. Still, I'm giving this sleeper a 5 star rating because not only does it make an excellent bassinet alternative, but because it's portable, it's great to bring to people's homes. Also, this does rock front to back, very slightly, but still effective. And lastly, the pad is removable and washable. I would highly recommend this sleeper for anyone expecting and it makes a great shower gift as well.
B008O3OIXU|2|This was much cheaper than the City Mini tray, so we figured we'd give it a go. It's installed on our City Mini stroller, but it tilts slightly backward. This means it's not ideal for holding drinks like coffee because they spill easily. It's fine for holding keys, phones, and water bottles.
B002K682OI|5|The other day my baby was playing with another 6.5 month old boy - that boy had this teether and my son took it and played/ate it for awhile. I decided it was worth getting him his own. We've had it for a week and he LOVES this teether. If you have a teething baby, buy this and your baby will be happy!
B0084DS9EE|3|cute but came with a hole (un- sewn area)  in the belly, will only be a decoration now instead of toy.
B004HO587A|2|Affordable reversible seat stroller. The seat back is way too short though! My 4 month old baby's head is at the top of the edge! I will not be able to use this stroller for much longer. He is 67 percentile for height so he's not a super tall baby....
B00MBFUXIQ|5|Perfect for in the car, I have three kids. Such a great investment. My kids love it too
B0070WGV9K|5|If you are looking for an easy to use and sturdy bedrail for a toddler than this is a great choice. The bedrail is very easy to put together for the first time and has a very handy locking mechanism that allows the rail to be lowered or stored. The pieces that attach to the mattress to keep the rail in place are strong and easy to adjust for different size mattresses. We used ours on both queen and twin mattresses and could not be happier with the bedrails performance. My son never fell out of bed despite rolling up against it a lot through the night.
B008PPPZB6|4|Grandchild likes it just right for teething
B003JJX2IG|5|The best product I have found, it provides extra protection on the sides and front which is perfect for little children!
B002C1AWXK|3|These are absolutely adorable but like some of reviewes said they DON'T hold up well, they are more of a wipe off bib and use for later with out EVER washing. I purchased two packs of these thinking they were great! Sadly I forgot that a couple of them went threw the wash and forgot to take them out...as you can imagine they melted to the back of my dryer. I know, completely my fault but with a 6 mth old I don't feel any quilt about forgeting to take a couple of bibs out of the wash.<br /><br />It was a pain to have to peal the plastic of the back of my dryer and the bibs look pretty bad.<br /><br />I tried e-mailing customer service they gave me replacements which is awesome but its a couple of there less popular ones. So my cute bibs are no more...<br /><br />LESSON: DONT PUT IN WAS UNLESS YOU REMEMBER TO PULL THEM OUT
B004IEBP1M|5|I don't usually submit reviews, but after going through 2 other car seats and my newborn screaming hysterically every time we put her in the car, she stopped crying with this seat! We tried an Eddie Bauer Designer 22- it's just not padded enough... we also bought a Britax Boulevard 70- which she didn't like but we'll use when she's too heavy to carry in this Graco.<br />  -Baby loves looking at the pattern.<br />  -The canopy shade slides where ever you need it and blocks out even bright sun.<br />  -The handle adjusts to many good angles.<br />  -The base is super easy to install and tighten.<br />  -Highly recommend... the swing that the seat fits into... awesome!
B008YGTW74|1|I bought these mats because I didn't want my baby to be exposed to formamide.  But I didn't expect them to smell like harsh chemicals.  I aired them out in the backyard, completely exposed on the grass, for weeks, and they still smell terrible.  I would return these if I still had the packaging.  For $70 incl. shipping, this was a huge waste.  I'm very disappointed.
B003VWPKL8|4|this set is awesome. i got it for my son who was sleeping in a baasinet up until 4 months and then we got a crib. i was looking for not too expensive bedding for good quality and cuteness. and this met all my expectations. tho only problem was that you need to hand wash it. i have no problem with that because i hand wash alot of my babys things. or you can use the gentle cycle. you get alot for a fair price. not over priced like alot of the other things out there. im in love with it, and my son loves it. he is 5 months now and loving the decorations it. keeps him busy for a little while. the only reason i gave it a 4 star is because of the hand washing. everything else is good.
B0000DEW91|4|Be careful about what sixe door you're putting them in. One of the three doorways we used them in was just a little smaller than the other two. It's a very tight squeeze and because of it the gate won't close on its own. But it gets the job done.<br /><br />In the other two doorways it works perfectly. It shuts behind me after I walk through. It's been great for corralling both the baby and the dog.
B000P24PVS|5|I love this blanket, it far exceeds any other child's blanket I have seen to date and I have been shopping for months.  I purchased it for my upcoming child and I cannot be more pleased.  It is the softest blanket I have seen and the textured look from the swirls in the fabric give it a very nice look.  I have washed it four or five times now and it has held up wonderfully.  The size is perfect, my two and a half year old snuggled up with it and it covers her whole body so it will obviously have a much longer life than your typical baby blanket.  It is absolutely worth the price, after I got this in the mail I put away the other blankets I had- they are now mere back ups in case of typical baby messes.
B002OOWAJO|2|The good - Very adjustable, easy to adjust, fits on chairs, and generally works as described.  Very easy to take off the fabric, run it through the washing machine.  Attaching it to a chair was a snap.<br /><br />The moderate - it generally seems to take up more room than it should - we are past the need for all of the reclining, which I think drove a lot of the space hogging.  It isn't at all practical to take this with you places.<br /><br />The bad - the tray is HUGE.  Way way bigger than necessary, which meant we could not get it to fit in our dishwasher, no matter how hard we tried.  For that reason we returned it and got the [[ASIN:B001GQ2RWQ Fisher-Price Healthy Care Deluxe Booster Seat, Red/White]].  That model had a tray that was plenty big enough, but easily fit in the dishwasher
B00HZO6VAC|5|Super cute frame. Love this in my office.
B004LD6VLO|1|Return reason: Defective/Does not work properly<br />Buyer comments: After simple instruction of inserting as per manual &#34;3 pieces of<br />1.5 V AAA Batteries&#34;  the cutie item does NOT FUNCTIONING at all!<br />I am wondering if this item, which came from HONG KONG, was inspected prior to shipment? :(  Well, huge mistake because now it's a major hassle to return and/or replace (shipping cost?).
B004F95G1A|5|Here I am writing this review at, no lie, 3am. I have just ordered another one because I lost the last... and I would officially call myself a believer. My daughter started wearing this from 4 months till around 11 months. Then it got misplaced. She cut 4 teeth from month 7-10 and she never cried about it and only fussed a little when she was tired... but then again she WAS tired. Anyways, she has another tooth coming in and My husband and I are up trying to get her to sleep! This is the first time this has ever happened because of teething. Crying, whimpering in pain, slight fever, Motrin not working, teething tabs not working. I'm just saying, from experience, that this is an amazing product and you never know how much you need it until it's gone. As a side note: It also looks beautiful and is easy to put on and my daughter never tries to play with it. It's pretty much the most amazing thing for teething.
B00LVH9K9I|2|The type of mitten we needed for our lil guy. We found them to be the perfect style and color but way too small for 3 month olds hands. Plus too tight around the wrist. Bummer !
B00U13TX2W|5|Love it
B002J4U8P2|4|Held my daughter's attention when she would sit at her high chair or when we were out to dinner/lunch.
B007TA3GC8|5|Good Item
B000056OUO|2|I thought this would be a great way to keep diapers and other items close at hand.  I was able to use it for a short time until the plastic piece that the wipes container sits on broke.  They need to use a better plastic.  I did have a problem with more than one diaper coming out at a time, like others have, but learned if you pull upward a little usually only one diaper will come out at a time.  If the company would use a stronger plastic I think this could be a very useful item.
B004Y42A1K|5|Great teething toy.
B003ULP59M|3|I'm an organize freak.  I got this product to keep the diapers and lotions in one place.  My baby is not born yet, but it's a nice space safer for the drawers so the diapers can be in one location.
B004RA8OTI|2|My daughter really likes the shape of the nipple, but the ridge along the shield leaves marks on her cheeks and chin after only a few minutes. It really should be more smooth. Also the nipple collects water after washing and sterilizing. No idea how to get the water out. The Nuk pacifier I have doesn't do this.
B007CTPWXW|5|Works perfect on my baby jogger city mini!
B002NYQYOW|5|This seat is great, we got one for my son when he turned 3 and a second one for our second car. Now child #2 is turning 3 and we plan on getting 2 more. We are often carting other kids around and these seats are extremely easy to more around from spot to spot or car to car. We've driven on long long road trips with this seat and never a complaint. Comfortable, secure, well priced and durable. I highly recommend this booster!<br /><br />I should add that my kids were both extremely tall and had maxed out their convertible toddler seats before we switched to these at age 3
B002M77N22|1|I just got this as a gift but haven't used it since my baby hasn't arrived yet. However I happened to be checking the recall lists on the consumer product safety commission's site today and this item was listed as of 01/08/2013... Here is the link: [...]<br />Having a sleeper prone to mold was enough to entice me to return it.
B002IP3Y6W|4|I bought the wriggle wrapper to use as a portable high chair for my 9 month old. It works very well for that purpose. It attaches quickly and easily to every chair I have tried. I can almost do it one handed, but not quite. The buckle, Velcro and snap closure is very secure. The wrapper is high enough to keep even a dedicated escape artist contained yet comfortable.     If you plan on using the wrapper at a regular table you will need something to boost the occupant up. I've had good luck with using a restaurant booster or anything really.     I haven't used it for sleeping or as a lap belt (that use seems silly to me) but if I do I will edit this review then.   As a portable highchair I find it functional and attractive. My only complaint is that it is fairly expensive compared to other similar items. I believe it is worth the extra cost because the simple attachment means it works where other portable chairs do not.
B004Y426XM|4|This worked very well for my almost 6 month old son (who is only a supported sitter).  I would have liked if the strap actually was more secure.  It is not attached to anything, only goes through some slits on the cover.  I pulled it out and put it around the cart to be a bit more secure.  I had to put my purse on one side and a blanket on the other for more support for my son.  He found the teether interesting and I haven't used the sippy cup strap yet.  But he absolutely loved being in the cart like this versus being in his carseat inside the cart.  :)
B00DB5F114|5|These bottles serve their purpose.  I don't feel that they are as good of quality as the bottles that came with my pump.  My little guy will soon be drinking more than what these bottles hold - they have done their job adequately for the price.
B00H8IO1PW|5|Excellent item very fast shipping!
B001VFR1I2|5|We already own two of the larger Blabla dolls, and when I saw the opportunity to pick up this bird and a pal - Octavio - for a really sweet price, I couldn't resist.    Like all Blabla animals these little cuties are hand-knitted in Peru, by artists who earn a living wage. That's two big pluses for me: no China, no slavery so we can have a cute toy.     They're about the size of a Ty Beanie Baby, only a bit fatter - so they're pretty small, but the perfect size for baby hands, and they have a little jingly rattle - sure to be a pleaser with wee ones too. Their colors are vibrant and lovely. Their outer is made of 100% cotton, with polyester filling.    I don't think I could choose - of the two we own - which I like best. They both have their own unique style and 'personality', each equally worthy of childhood adoration.
B002SZT35S|5|Bought this for my in-laws after seeing a scary news report about toddlers being severely injured or killed by unsecured TVs. Installs easily to the back of the TV, straps secured easily to a bar on their TV stand with no drilling. Makes me feel better since neither of them are fast enough to run across the room and grab him before he tips it over.  Totally worth the money and the few minutes it took. Amazon is one of the few places I found this type of product available and the price was the best.
B004GHN2E4|5|This is a very beautiful stroller. Actually pois grey looks better than on picture.  We just received it yesterday and it is everything we were hoping to receive.  Very nice!
B00BRHSD90|5|Every new Mom and Dad need one of these, has pretty much everything they need!
B006YPTWHC|5|I exclusively breast feed, my baby has only had a bottle of pumped milk a grand total of 3 times.  He is 3 1/2 months.  Tried the mimijumi first, he took it, but he would not really latch on to it, he just sucked the end of nipple.  He took and latched the mOmma very quickly!  As far as fast flow.... I have fast flow breasts it seems like LOL so that was no problem.  He did not choke and it did NOT make a mess with this bottle!  I love it!<br /><br />Recommend for breast feeding babies for sure.  The nipple is soft like a real breast which is why I think he latched well.  The mimijumi is not very soft/squishy.
B00OJN7L3I|1|First, I received 3 requests for a review. We hadn't even gone on our trip yet. Please calm down with the emails asking for reviews and back off.  Believe it or not,some people actually plan in advance for travel.<br /><br />I decided to review once we used it if was worthy of my time. Based on being annoyed by the seller and the way that the bag made it through one way on our trip, I am very unsatisfied!<br /><br />The bag ripped. One way half way across the country, two planes,and it is ripped! Obviously not durable and not meant for travel! I am very disappointed in how expensive this product was and the result I got. A bag for another car seat that was less than half the cost made by jeep held up through a few round trips before it showed damage.
B003BKN1JS|1|I was really disappointed with these slippers.  The are extremely thin and seem to run very small.  I would not recommend these.
B006UDLXGQ|5|Washed it. Still super soft and it's double sided.
B0052QYLUM|5|As far as signal is concerned it works great! Picture is clear and good! It has taken a spill on our tile floor and survived. The only thing I don't like is the sound sensor on it is not activated all the time... My son sleeps just down the hall and sometimes I hear him before the monitor does. Other than that I LOVE IT! We have this monitor pair with the Angle Care which gives me peace of mind!!
B000WIBFCC|4|As a child growing up, I always had the impeller type humidifiers in which a spinning tube would draw water inside of it and then toss it out in a visible mist.  While these could be quite effective, they had the drawback of being loud and soaking everything around them.<br /><br />When my daughter was born, we got an ultrasonic humidifier.  The mist was a little finer, but again, it had the tendency to soak everything around it, and created scale on itself and its surroundings with tap water.<br /><br />So this time I decided to go with the evaporative type of humidifier.  With these, a fan draws moisture out of a wick filter that is then disbursed about the room.  These types of humidifiers have the advantage of being self-regulating because evaporation is quicker in a dry room, slower in a moist room.  They also trap the minerals and bacteria that may be in the water in the filter instead of spraying them in the room.  The disadvantages are that they require costly filters, and you have to treat the water to keep bacteria, mold, and scale from building up on the filter and components.  Both of these can be achieved with the addition of a few drops of humidifier treatments that can be found at your local Wal-Mart.<br /><br />With all this in mind, I did lots of comparison shopping and finally turned to the Graco 1.5 Gallon Cool Mist Humidifier.  This compact unit appears to be much more durable than other brands at a similar price point, and since its components are dishwasher safe, it is much easier to give it a thorough cleaning.  Although the unit could be considered loud, especially on its high setting, the low setting is quite pleasant to me, and provides a nice white noise to counteract background sounds.  Most importantly, it does a good job of raising the humidity into comfortable levels during the winter.  And with the water appropriately treated, there is NO mold on my filter and minimal mineral deposits.<br /><br />Note: this is advertised as a \\"baby\\" humidifier, but its shape and design fit as well as any other humidifier in any room of your house.  We bought two.  One for our bedroom, the other for my daughter.t its shape and design fit as well as any other humidifier in any room of your house.  We bought two.  One for our bedroom, the other for my daughter.
B00P7PO2ZC|4|Good design, not so amazona fabric but it is resistant.
B0016L0MMS|1|I purchased this for my son.  He sat on it for 1 minute and complained his bottom hurt.  I put a towel around the edges to make it softer, but he still complained.  Now I'm trying to find a softer & larger portable potty.
B003ZDGCK6|5|We bought this to keep at our house for when our granddaughter comes to visit.  Although our roads are paved, there are bumps & rough patches.  This stroller is perfect for our evening walks.  When she is old enough, we may let her daddy use it when he runs to take her on a faster ride!
B00G96MPW0|5|We've used this for cloth diapers for 10 months in a regular kitchen trash bin and it's taken a beating. We wash it about once a week and use a baking soda stick up thing to control the diaper smell. Very highly recommended. Well-made product.
B006TVS7U4|5|Absolutely LOVE this pillow! I have also tried the Boppy and the Ergo Baby nursing pillow and neither compare. I love the shape of this. Also, no matter Mom's size, it fits perfect. It falls to a slant so the baby is angled and isn't laying flat so you can position accordingly and also helps with spit up. It's great for any nursing position, even football hold. I HIGHLY recommend this pillow. We are going on month 5 soon of nursing and we still use it all the time.
B002OPSLSC|5|I bought this chair for my 2 year old daughter because we were having a hard time getting her to sit at the table for dinner, she constantly wanted to get up and down from a regular dining chair.  We bought this chair telling her it was her own special chair and she loves it.  She sits better at the table, she can climb up herself, and we have the option to buckle her in if she is having one of her days that she doesn't want to sit still at the dinner table.  We love that you can adjust the height of the seat to accommodate the child's height and it pulls right up to the table, so she doesn't have to sit on her knees to reach and no booster seat that ruins your dining room chair.  It wipes clean easily with just a damp cloth, but holds up to a cleaner if necessary.  We love this chair and are tempted to buy another one for my 4 year old.
B00QD1K01E|5|Incredibly good quality!  The best mattress cover I've bought on Amazon.  Amazing product for a really good price!  If you want a super nice mattress cover for your baby, this is the only one to consider.
B001CWAVJ0|5|we had the original sticky one on our tub in our old house and literally couldn't remove it when we moved so we left it there. I purchased this one a little nervous that it wouldn't be able to hold up the toys like the sticky one did, but it has worked great! have not had to re-stick it at all and its been over a month since I hung it up
B002CGRT1S|4|The gate is attractive and accomplishes what it set out to do.  The latch is a little difficult at time both to latch and unlatch.  However, it seems to perfect for my deck to prevent my grandchildren and dog from escaping.
B000O7SR18|5|I originally bought two of these for our Graco Pack n Play.  They are perfect.  Now that my baby can sit, I had been looking for a shopping cart cover but couldn't bring myself to buy one for $50.  So, I just took one of these sheets to Costco, put it on the cart like you would a regular cart cover, and cut holes where the legs go, and two in the back for the straps. The sheet is just big enough for a Costco cart, and works great on regular carts.  It's not fancy, but it offers a level of protection from gross carts for a fraction of the cost.  Another plus is that the fabric is thin enough to connect a toy to the cart using a link over the fabric.  I just ordered a new sheet to replace the one that has been \\"re-purposed\\".  Love it!
B0083WVGTG|4|This is a good, solid product, and it has served us well. My 24-mo daughter is tiny and afraid to sit on the &#34;big potty&#34; in many public restrooms (especially the ones with a very loud automatic flush). For that reason, she refuses to sit on this seat as a potty cover. Thus we use it exclusively on the floor as a stand-alone potty chair with the disposable liners. It's very low to the ground (&#60;6&#34;), but she has no trouble sitting and seems to love it. We've never had problems with it collapsing. What I do NOT like about this chair is that folding it back up to stow takes more effort than expected. I have to brace it against my body, which is not what I want to do with ANYthing I've just picked up off a bathroom floor (eeewww!). So now it stays in the potty-chair position all the time, and I carry it around like that. It's a little bulkier, but hey, there's going to be a certain amount of nuisance when you're carrying an entire potty around, whether it's flat or not. On balance, I'd recommend it and even buy it again. But I'm also looking forward to her outgrowing it!
B00020V5A2|5|I bought this monitor after one frightful morning when I awoke to find my daughter seizing. I couldn't tell on my audio only monitor, so with new found paranoia, I needed to watch her every minute. I have had this monitor for one year, and it is left on almost all day. I have no problems except that the reception gets a little fuzzy when someone walks near the monitor. I can see my daughter clearly when she is sleeping and as she is a restless sleeper, can also see her whole bed when I attached it to the wall. I highly recommend for the nervous mother, but be warned, you will not sleep, but sit up nights  staring at your child. Also bought for my second child because now I need to watch him too.
B00BCCEALA|4|cute design on this bag it&#34;s hard to find cute design for baby boys in the stores i would say it is a medium size bag
B002XMWILC|5|I love this night light! It's easy to take around the nursery or the house, it has just enough light to see what you're doing without being enough to really wake the baby, and I love the fact that after about 20 minutes it shuts itself off. My baby likes it to be on the color changing mode when she falls asleep because it's very soothing. This night light has to sharp edges, is perfect size to fit in a little kid's hand when my child gets to where she's old enough to go to the bathroom on her own in the middle of the night, and stays cool to the touch so she will be able to keep it in the bed with her if she wants, then it can sit and charge during the day when it's not needed. Wonderful product! I highly recommend this for everyone!
B0032FOOQQ|3|I needed it for a screen door (full length) to keep dog, child, from pushing out the screen while visiting at a relatives home. The screen door frame rendered it impossible to fit. Not sure how I could have determined that to begin with since specified measurements seemed ok. It is the extra width necessitated by the tabs that did not work. If the inside of the door had been flat I would have velcro-ed it to the frame instead of drilling holes for the screws so it would fit...but not an option.  The material is strong and would be easily cleaned. I am really disappointed it did not work. Now...must get creative to figure out just what I might be able to use it for at home. Not worth the shipping to send it back.
B000M5HZ8I|5|Bought this for my son's nursery and I still use it 3 years later :) I love it!
B00A2HUDN0|3|My husband and I both find it extremely difficult to loosen and tighten the straps when putting out daughter int he seat.
B002FKE4UU|5|stick well, pull up well. Get the job done nicely.
B0000789TD|1|I didn't like this because I couldn't see my son in the mirror.  I drive an SUV and I found a bigger mirror instead.
B00D4LFDAY|2|Very thin material, not comforter quality at all
B0066SR6SO|3|Kinda chincy....
B00OXYF3WO|2|They are absolutely beautiful. I love that you can take out the letters.  However, they're too hard for babies!  It is not suitable for babies who are still learning to roll, sit or crawl because when they fall on these tiles it will hurt them as it did my baby.  I purchased this item at a nearby retail chain.  My sole purpose of buying this was to place on my hardwood floors for her to practice her developmental milestones believing that if she does fall it wouldn't hurt as much because it's soft foam. However, these are not soft foam.  You can hear a loud thud when the baby falls.  I do recommend this for older kids who has more control but I do not recommend to babies who are still learning to roll sit or crawl because these tiles are hard.  We are back to the drawing board looking for a softer mat.
B00ECHYTBI|3|I really wanted a video monitor that was *not* WiFi as I didn't want the use to be dependent on using the internet...for example, if we traveled with it, or if our internet went down. Love the large screen size. Night vision works very well, not blurry at all. The controls are easy once you know which button does what, but they are not clearly marked (white on beige?!). Love that the camera moves so freely and easily when you want to remotely move it. Super easy to set up. I didn't think I would care about the thermostat that is part of the camera unit, but it's actually quite handy. LOVE the interchangeable lenses, and it's easy to just screw and unscrew to change them. The sound quality is excellent too. My major complaint is that it seems to get interference frequently, as it drops the signal whenever I get on my laptop, which means I end up having to move the parent unit to another spot until it stops. Otherwise a very good video monitor at a good price.
B0050PL4QE|4|Works just like the original Medela adapter but half the size. A lot less bulky & takes up less space when bringing the pump around.
B00CMSP7EM|5|Excellent quality!
B001KZJY2O|4|I like this pillow because it is the perfect size for my daughter's day care. She has 3C hair, and I needed a pillow with a satin pillowcase so her hair wouldn't get messed up while she took her nap at day care. I didn't give it five stars because it won't last more than a year. I'll have to buy another one for next year. However, for the price, I don't mind buying another one.
B008I4FALY|5|I have had this for 2 months and so far it is great. Easy to insert regular kitchen trash bags into. So far it does not allow ofor to escape.
B00F1CPBQ0|5|I bought it 1 month back and my three old boy loves and enjoy this a lot.  A smile comes on his face when I leave him to play with this.
B008HGNDYO|5|This small pillow is perfect for little ones.
B002UD65XQ|5|We bought this protector pad cover as a backup for my cousin’s baby’s crib. They thought they did not need it when they open the gift. You know the smirky smile with a head cocked thank you. Two weeks later we got a phone call THANK YOU!!!!!! They found out even newborns diapers leak. It was sure nice to be able to switch bedding, pad cover and get the baby back to sleep.
B00004TFLB|5|As a mother of 5, I know a little bit about toys. This block is great. It keeps the little ones entertained and the older ones jam out on it like rockstars. The edges are fairly soft so not many bumps and bruises. The batteries seem to have lasted forever. Great item.
B0051GJ7PC|1|This product took me 4 hours to assemble, and once it was done the drawers would NOT stay intact nor align with the rails.  I could barely transport it from one room to another it was so wobbly.  I disposed of it two days later, complete waste of $200.
B0002X98GM|4|I was so happy to find these sleeveless bodysuits because I live in the caribbean and it is hot all the time. The material is a good, soft, quality cotton - i'll go so far as to compare them to carter's.    I bought the boy's set and one of them has a cute sailboat print, the other is a stripe and the last a plain blue one. The neck opening does not stretch and would be better if it had an overlap opening or snaps on the back or on one shoulder.    Overall a good product that could be made great with a few small adjustments.
B00A69H616|5|Luvable Friends makes several different animal towels. I have now purchased the monkey, duck, elephant, and frog. I'm very satisfied with all of them..and my baby is also.
B00O64QJLK|5|Great to let Little one play in high chair for a few min while you eat a few bites.
B001HDCYYO|5|I have twins and I bought this since the stroller only comes with 1. It is identical to the one that came with the stroller and works perfectly with the stroller and out chicco key fit 30 Solaris infant car seats! Well worth the price I paid for the convienence and ease of placing them both in the stoller in their infant seats!
B0011Y0IN8|5|love this carrier. Great back and shoulder support for parents and it lets baby be forward facing.
B005IWM7WE|5|Es excelente
B00AJSIW6C|5|great deal.. great price.. we have travel and our kid loves it...<br />great color and has cup holder..light not the heavy
B0009EXN10|5|good deal
B00N19UU8O|5|Great buy! VERY soft! My son is still obsessed with these Muslin blankets and he is 18 mo. old. Every so often, I have to buy a few more because they start ripping apart. These are great.
B005MQR708|5|I made this purchase as my second child outgrew the infant carseat in her 8th month. I had family (grandma and 1 yr old cousin) coming to visit and wanted to be able to ride all 5 of us in one vehicle during their stay. We were able to fit all three carseats in the back just by having one of the Diono RadianR100 Convertible seats (used in the narrow middle seat)!! It saved us gas to run a second vehicle and made outtings simpler by all riding together. IF we have a third of our own, we will definitely being getting another Diono RadianR100 Convertible Car Seat. It installed effortlessly and it is apparent that it's high quality, from the fabric to the frame and the straps and buckles. Nothing about it is 'cheap'. And we won't have to buy a bigger vehicle to accommodate the kids carseats :)
B004OR1DNI|3|My son is 1, and I was really hoping to get more use out of it. He does play with the individual peices, but I was really hoping he would scoop up the bugs into the net.
B00Z4OIIGU|2|Not great
B0000936M4|5|I love all the Dr. Brown's bottles. My son has never had any problems with colic, excessive spit up or gas. I attribute this to these bottles. He was even great on these when switching between bottle and breast - no problems. When I had to use other bottles in a pinch, he wasn't happy eating.  <br /> <br />Our microwave is too small to warm the standard 8 ounce in. The wide neck, 8 ounce bottles are perfect. They achieve exactly what I need them to in all areas. <br /> <br />The only cons about Dr. Brown's bottles are that our son has a hard time feeding from any other bottle. This bottle is so effective that on the occasions he has used different bottles, he didn't know to let go to let air fill up the bottom of the bottle. It was frustrating, and we had to keep breaking the seal in his mouth for him. If you're going to use Dr. Brown's, stick to these bottles only. Also, the nipple on the wide neck is different from standard, and it takes baby a few feedings with the new nipple to get used to it. Additionally, if any of the Dr. Brown's bottles are not assembled correctly and the collar isn't on tight enough they will leak. There are additional parts that need to be cleaned, but its well worth it! <br /> <br />I'd never buy another brand! <br />
B000I1T8DQ|5|My baby loves the lights and sounds.  Mirror is great.  It is very light which is nice given how much it does.  Overall we are very pleased.
B000WUB9O4|5|I bought the chair before my daughter was born. From day one, she loved the vibration mode. It put her to sleep with in moments. It is very easy to take along wherever you go. She is now 6 months old and she still loves the chair. We make sure she is always strapped in and if she is sitting up, we always have the \\"kickstand\\" out. I know moms of toddlers who still use this chair today (as a rocker). Love it, great price. Not so crazy about the print, but at this point I could care less.
B007D1O91K|5|excellent size.. fits well with stability
B000RC2VJY|4|This mat is really great to have around when out with the wee ones.  It rolls up pretty nice to be kept in the diaper/gear bag. The suction cups keep it attached to the table. And the whole point is to keep your kids food off the dirty tables at the restaurant or your dirty relatives. If you're kid is at the finger food stage and you like to eat out often then I'd highly recommend getting this.
B009EDSWJA|5|This is a great changing pad for the money. I read other complaints about the smell but mine didn't smell at all. No complaints.
B001LNOZ9W|4|We bought one for our son and it works wonderfully.  Prior to this, we were using blankets to swaddle him, the way they taught us to in the hospital.  He always found a way to break out of the swaddle both in the hospital and at home.  So we bought it, and it has done wonders because he no longer wakes up because his hands got out of the swaddle and startled him.  He's three months old, and we continue to use the product.    However, our advice is to consider buying a cotton one before you buy the fleece.  Most of us heat our homes to around 70 degrees, so the fleece might end up being too hot.  We noticed that our baby was starting to develop a heat rash, so we switched to the cotton Kiddopotoamus SwaddleMe blanket.  This worked well, and the heat rash went away.    Another tip - we've noticed that our baby can get his hands out of the swaddle now.  The way we prevent this is get him to put his arms parrallel and along to his body inside the blanket.  If you allow him to fold his arms on top of him, he will be able to get out as he gets bigger and gains in strength.
B00009IMCK|5|cute
B002FB7FLY|5|These inserts are FANTASTIC for overnight! I use one of these paired with a microfiber and it has been leak proof so far. Hemp is definately the way to go and for the price I am even more impressed!
B00BKV0O68|5|good product
B0018B9VIW|5|We used this mainly as a car potty because my son did not like loud flushing public restrooms.   It is very lightweight but sturdy in the back of our SUV, seems comfortable and we never had any leaking/tipping/splashing issues.  This chair is super easy to clean thanks to its lack of moving parts.  I'd buy it again.
B004VB0GRG|4|This is a really comfortable wrap and it only takes a few tries to get the tension right and even on all portions of the wrap before you are out the door with your baby in tow. The moby acts not only as a carrier but a swaddle so baby is soothed and quiets down nicely. Instead of bringing in the car seat to restaurants or instead of putting my newborn into a stroller, I use the moby and keep her close to me when I am out and about on errands or at lunch and she sleeps the whole way through in this wrap. I love knowing she is always close to me AND I am hands free at the grocery when I want to be. The only thing I don't like but cannot change is that the wrap is so long it drags on the floor when you put it on. There is nothing you can do about it... Just keep your floors ore clean I guess.
B00005BTYU|4|OMG this is \\"THE CRIB TO HAVE\\", pretty, inexpensive, and amazingly easy to put together in 10 minutes FLAT (even if u have an 8 month belly and just desperate to see ur baby crib in the room, lol).<BR>The only down side to this crib, it can be tricky pulling the sides down, and i do have to unhook one latch at the time to bring it down, but i doubt i'll be needing to pull the sides up and down very often other than to change the sheets. <br />Good luck to all mommys out there and happy shopping :O)
B001QKDI48|5|These bags come in very handy.  I keep one in the car, in my diaper bags and in the house. They smell great and lock in odors.  Pretty easy to use although it can be difficult to find the tear point. The listed price of $3.99 is the same as target or Walmart without having to pay for shipping n handling.
B001SKKW0E|2|I was so excited about finally finding something that would help keep my 2 year old away from the outlets.  It would have worked great except it didn't fit the plugs that I needed to cover.
B007JBF3JG|5|This decal just &#34;made&#34; the nursery look finished... it was really easy to put up and it saved the walls in our rental house.
B006QRFO3O|5|we've cloth diapered my now 26 month old since she was 8 months old, and this diaper has been wonderful. we've tried many types and brands, but this one has been the easiest, most durable, and the ONLY one with no leaks..EVER. if you can't afford very many of these, try getting two or three. it will definitely be your go-to diaper.
B00B1M2P7W|4|We start using this Swaddle after 2 weeks old for our baby, and amazing its fast and convenient, especially for those active babies, as they kick very hard and often. The only thing we dont like is the sticker part, its quite large and will make noise anytime we open to change the diaper, sometimes it scared our baby lol
B00081L2Q2|2|These cling-on shades are ridiculous, they can't stick right and have countless air bubbles and you can't even open the window without it peeling off. Also with the ridiculous air-bubbles it is hard to look through the window when changing lanes. I wouldn't recommend them to anyone.
B00978OWVE|5|My teething daughter thinks these are wonderful.  The material is soft and colorfast, even after repeated dishwashing liquid washings.  An hour in the freezer is sufficient to chill them down, so they're usable multiple times per day, if needed.
B008U1VAD2|2|I can't even express how upset by this blanket I am! It maybe durable as it claims it feels like its made of burlap, but could not be further from soft and snuggley!! If I didn't decorate an entire room based off this bedding I would return it... in fact I still may
B001AVMF10|5|This is the only &#34;cici&#34; my daughter loves.  She'll use the other narsutten shape if she has to, but this is the preferred choice by far.  She didn't like this style much when she was younger, but I accidentally got this kind once and all others paled.
B0018CI5ME|5|When I bought my Bjorn Travel Crib, they weren't yet making a special sheet to fit the mattress. I see they now sell a Bjorn travel crib sheet on Amazon for $42.95 (as of the date of this review). These porta crib sheets from ABC fit the Bjorn Travel Crib mattress just fine and are nice and soft.
B001I459AS|5|We've been using this hamper in my toddler son's room for the last year and I love it.  It's lightweight but very sturdy.  I'm always putting wet washcloths on the edge to dry before they go in the hamper and it's never off balance from the weight.  The mesh sides also help any damp clothes air out.  The handles are durable and make it easy to carry a full hamper to the washer.  And it holds a ton of clothes.  It's nothing special but it does a great job.
B009UPUFCY|2|Very disappointed with this product. We got it for Christmas and have used it for less than 2 months and it is already broken. Prior to the lullavibe breaking it would eat batteries. We were changing the 4 AA batteries every 1.5-2 weeks; which that in itself is outrageous. After getting tired of replacing batteries so often we decided to use rechargeable batteries. After installing the rechargeable batteries the entire unit stopped working. It's almost as it there is a short in the wiring. If there is a short in the wiring that could be a potential fire issue...very scary. Disappointed overall--would not recommend to anyone to purchase.
B000067EH7|5|Great tub!!  Fits in your kitchen sink well and makes bathtime quick and easy. I have a newborn and plan on using the tub even when she becomes a toddler.  The non-skid pad inside works great and she sits well upright in the tub as I bathe her.  Works well.  Good product!
B004U2VGF2|1|Didn't fit like it was suppose to.
B000YDDF6O|5|I ordered this for my grandson.  He absolutely loves it.  Catchy tunes and bright colors.  It was easy for him to grasp.
B00CMJ226M|4|This bag is good quality to use and also the price is reasonable, I already used it for a month.
B006GYLKOO|3|These would be better if they had adhesive in more than one spot. They fell off easily.
B002GDF8GU|5|happy
B006PD0MAO|3|Over priced, but great teaching tool, our daughter loves letters and so she really enjoys them in the tub.  Our only other issue is they have some really odd animals for some letters, like a jackal for j, and a vulture for v. there was even a few we can't figure out like for the letter x it looks like a hummingbird.  I know that it can be hard to find animals for every letter, but maybe it should be things other than animals.
B003LNU8PK|5|Nice straps, easy to buckle, and compatible with my Graco Duodiner high chair. Exactly what I needed for a used high chair that was missing the straps.
B001ZT12T8|5|I was growing tired of disposable nursing pads all the time.  Saw this and decided to give it a try. It is great! I love that I am able to have a bottle worth of milk by the end of the day without pumping. Yes it is big, (will most likely only use it around the house) but works great.
B0042RU2UA|3|This owl is cute, and has many things my daughter likes, like the crinkle sounding wings, mirror, and teething limbs. The little owl in the pouch is frustrating to my daughter is she gets upset that she cannot remove the baby owl which is attached to the mama owl!  Many colors and textures makes this a good toy.
B000LNEEK8|4|This is a cute Dorothy costume.  It is cheaply made as the other reviews have said and the bow is not even usable.  However, we are only using the costume once, so it will work out fine.
B0015XKCZE|1|We bought this for our 7 month old and he enjoyed playing with it, but it is not well made.  The stitching attaching the car to the ball came apart after only a week.  The car was almost falling off of the ball and could have easily come off and he could have choked on it.
B009ES1MZ6|5|I ordered the espresso/caramel and it was BEAUTIFUL! This is a great gateway carrier and was also super comfortable. I've mode on to tula now, but if you're on a budget or are a beginner this is perfect!
B00LCYTDJM|5|Latches to the kid, no more cleaning the passy when it falls on the floor, good stuff
B00S55UWFK|4|product came on time and looks really nice.
B00L2FPBXS|3|I bought twice, first order was just one necklace, it was delivered directly and was just what we wanted. The baby is getting relief from it. The second order I ordered two more but this order did not arrive in a timely matter due to address mistake, and the product was not as smooth or heavy as the first order. I know that they are hand made and will be different but didn't think that there would be that much different. The twins Mother doesn't use them as she feels they're to rough in texture for the babies.
B0070MNI6E|1|one of them had a large string loose and ended up unwounded like yarn. they were poorly made. no good!
B007F5PT0O|5|love it, my granddaughter loves her matching taggies rattle and blanket.  She snuggles with them and smiles.  Thank you.
B001P4IBTM|5|I love the colors in it- it's so beautiful. GREAT price for everything it came with. I'll definitely be buying more to match!
B00BBKLMUA|4|Does the job well, except night time picture quality is not the greatest. But theres no delay. We use it everynight. Very easy to use. And it pan and tilt is great.
B00004TFLB|3|Great toy concept. Definitely engaging for the wee ones. I found it to be most utilized between the ages of 6 months and 1 1/2 years old. I would really like to give this more stars, but one of the panels broke early on.
B004TUTSZU|5|This crib mattress pad is a good price and very durable even if washed frequently.  It is waterproof so it makes cleaning up accidents very easy.
B000Q5KH3E|4|Got this for my son when he was about a month old. I was worried he wouldn't be totally interested in it because they say the black/white/red contrast is best suited for newborns. However he is now a little over 6 months old and still loves it! Wether laying down and staring up at it or me holding him and letting him watch and grab and bat at it. As far as quality goes.. It's kinda crappy. The plastics part you slide the cards into are terribly cheap. Kinda had to crack and split all of them to fit the card inside. But it's nothing terribly noticeable unless you're really examining. However I have never changed the cards since. I'd imagine if you plan on swapping them out, they will take a major beating after a few times. The winding aspect of it also really blows. Even if you crank it all the way the music will only play for maybe three or four minutes. Now, my son doesn't sleep in his crib, so this isn't a huge deal for us... But if you want a mobile that will play and lull babe to sleep for however long that may take... Find another option. We just use ours for fun and play.
B008VWHG7E|5|Great for my toddler girl 2 years and 3 months old. Not heavy but enough sturdy for her. We are just starting with potty training in the toilet.
B00M8BX182|5|Very happy!
B002WB2GLQ|5|We waited for a while for this item to come back in stock and I'm so happy we decided to wait rather than buying another stroller.  We really, really love this item.  It's well-made and really easy to use.  I do wish it had cup-holders, but the stroller is so awesome it's not that big of a deal for us.  We haven't found a universal cup-holder that works with this particular stroller, yet, but we'll keep looking.  The rotating feature is simple and really easy to use, the bassinet is so comfortable and the sun-shade is huge.  It's easy to maneuver and our little girl loves riding in it.  We haven't used the universal car seat attachment yet, but it was a big selling point that it's included with the stroller.  My only \\"complaints\\" are the lack of cup-holders and the fact that the stroller is so light; attaching the diaper bag will tip the stroller over. This was one of our favorite baby purchases and I would highly recommend this stroller.
B000YDDF6O|5|Both of our children have loved this toy.
B003JT4HOE|5|they are exactly what i expected. They help the baby to eat on his own without everything dropping off the spoon and he can easily get it into his mouth
B0006N8XJ6|5|My wife and I will not use any other cup design except for these.Our 4 year old used nothing but this design from the time we discovered them until she stopped using sippy cups regularly (she still uses them on occasion). Our 2 year old has never used anything else.<br /><br />They are the best cup for leak protection in our experience. Others either didn't offer real spill protection at all, or would quickly lose their ability to prevent spills/leaks. Over time, the leak proteciton insert in these does decrease in effectivness, but it still only allows a slow drip, which is fine if you don't let your kids take their cups anywhere they want to (and leave them sitting on their side). They are dishwasher safe, and hold up great as long as you don't use soap that is overly abrasive. The harsh soap won't damage the cup or lid, but it will cause the designs to peel off of the cup.
B00E606N5G|4|Very soft and cute face on lamb our granddaughter loves the music it plays too.  She now sleeps with it after it is wound up.
B006ZSYHDC|5|This is a must have for the summertime.  This allows a little bit more warmth for the baby without using a blanket.  We have used it into the slightly colder months as well.  What you have to remember about layering is, it's not so much about the thickness of the layers, but more about the fact that there are any layers at all.  The biggest benefit of a layer is trapping the air in between.  This trapped air holds the heat just a little longer.  Granted in the wintertime, it's probably too thin, but there are other products for that.
B000G7TIZA|1|Lasted 4.5 months before tearing at the seam.  Once this happens, a kicking baby will just make the tear bigger and bigger.  Crappy quality.
B0038KTPMS|5|so cute. my daughter loves it. We will probably need to buy another. It gets a lot of use.
B0030DFRMA|4|We have used the nice, non-Target aden + anais swaddle blankets as great nursing covers, stroller blankets and sun covers, in addition to swaddling blankets.  They're nice and soft and have held up well, so now that our baby is outgrowing the Medium-sized sleepsacks he's currently using, I decided to try the aden + anais sleeping bag. I chose Large based on the weight recommendation as our baby is quite chubby for his age and weighs between 22 and 28 pounds-- but could barely believe the size of the sleeping bag as I unfolded it.  It's HUGE, especially in terms of length. I like it, it's soft and thick, but breathable and looks very well made.  However, I give it four stars based on the weird size, which doesn't seem \\"standard\\".  Other sleepsacks/sleep bags are not as big unless they're the adjustable kind.
B004W02YMG|3|I love this pillow, but at 5`9&#34; I find it to be a little on the short side for me. Offers great support when I'm in the fetal position
B0000936LR|4|My baby loves her play gym!  It's colorful and she loves the mirror and rattles and all the accessories.  The couple of issues I have with it are not major.  First, I had to tear 23 tags off all the little do-dads and the mat and such.  23! (They are really stiff tags so I didn't want her to scratch herself with them)      The star that lights up and plays songs is great for tummy time... it gives her something to look at.  But there is no volume control, and it seems a little loud (she's scared herself awake when she moves it and it starts playing the music).      I also feel it's a little pricey for what it is.  If I hadn't received it as a shower gift, I'd never have purchased it myself.
B00IYCA600|5|These are great! They look awesome on the wall. Peeled off the sheets easily and were very easy to smooth out while applying. I had to rearrange a couple and they peeled off and re-stuck very well. The larger animals are a fairly good size too!
B004QZBEBO|5|Love, love, love this set of cleaners.  So multi-purpose, and easy to take apart, store, travel with, etc.  Every parent should own these.
B000GKJVF4|5|My baby is now 9 months and this mobile has helped her go to sleep on many occassions.  It's a nice soothing mobile without loud colors or too much going on to distract the baby instead of lulling to sleep.
B000V44B4G|4|What a fantastic design. It's so simple, yet there's nothing else like it out there. It lets our 2-year-old sit at the dinner table &#34;in a big-boy chair&#34; with the rest of the family. Inconspicuous, easy to install/remove. Very portable. Super stable - he can climb into the chair by himself without tipping the chair even a little.<br /><br />Update: Knocking off 1 star for durability issues. The Kaboost is now in the trash, as the legs have broken off the hub. Any kind of flexing or moving of the chair across the floor with the Kaboost installed can contribute to these joints failing. Still, a must-have while it lasted, so 4/5.
B008K3YW6M|4|Very comfortable size for me (5'3&#34;) and great for rocking and nursing my newborn; but the end on the nursing stool broke upon using it the 2nd time during nursing:  tried glueing it and it broke the next day.  Next step is to use screws.  Otherwise really like the rocker and ottoman.
B000BNQC58|5|The PROS: It is lightweight enough so my baby (5 months) can play with it. I give it to my baby in the morning as he wakes up & this keeps him busy for a few more minutes while I get a little more sleep. :) He loves touching the light (shell), watching the constellations around his crib, & changing the colors on the turtle. I also use it at night as a cue for bedtime & I notice it settles him down after a long busy day. He loves looking at the room filled with stars. I keep it on & enjoy it myself while I breastfeed him before bedtime. The timer option is also great.   The CONS: You can't really see the brown constellation, only the blue & the green.
B0052QYLUM|4|I wish it had a sleep button on so I could still hear but the display would sleep. Like it.
B00S0RFK4Q|5|Love this car seat
B00NID7NWE|4|I do think it's a very cute and trendy stroller, for the price it's pretty great BUT beware, this is HEAVY and BIG. It's no good for traveling in my opinion because it's way too bulky and not all the easy to open and close. I'm 5'3&#34; and not very strong so this isn't petite girl friendly. I will have to buy one of those cheap lightweight strollers for traveling (we travel a lot) However it's going to be great to take out on the nearby trail, definitely 4x4 and comfy for baby. Since we were going to splurge I wanted neutral colors so it would be good with baby number two, and this looks tough enough to outlast a couple of babies. It is a travel system, but you have to switch the seat with the adapters it brings. I would recommend.
B00264VSKE|5|Very nice quality pacifier that comes with a cap to protect the nipple of the pacifier when not in use.
B00L49L1TK|4|My baby was born early and spent 6 weeks in the NICU, which meant I was exclusively pumping for a while. I looked everywhere for a bra that I could wear all day and pump hands-free in, and was shocked how few options there are. I found a total of 2 good options, and this one was half the price of the other, so I ordered it. When it arrived, I tried it on with high hopes and was kind of disappointed because (maybe it's because I'm relatively small chested) it didn't fit super well. Because there are so many layers, it doesn't lay quite flat even when they're smoothed out as much as possible, and the band on the bottom is slightly loose on me. If I was wearing it under a solid colored lightweight tee, it would look lumpy and awkward, so I didn't want to wear it out of the house. That said, it is GREAT to sleep in. Very comfortable, and I could wake up in the middle of the night and not have to fumble with zippers or putting anything else on. So much easier! It's pretty easy to slide out of the way to nurse, as well. I would probably buy this again.
B000EDH4FC|2|I only traveled a 2 1/2 hour flight. When I went to pick up the car seat from the belt, the handle broke. The bag kept in place but without the handle what's the use. I can't imagine if I was going across Europe or wanted to use this more than once.
B00BVUQF02|5|Only pacifiers my newborn will take.  Perfect size for infants!
B00Q2VIWLK|2|The image of this item made it look bigger and more elegant than what I actually received. Still going to give this as a gift but only with additional items
B000OS8BP4|5|I did a lot of research on nose aspirators before settling on the Nosefrida.  The standard blue bulb was extremely upsetting to my 3 mo old son, and frustrating for me and my husband.  Not to mention ineffective.     The very day I ordered our Nosefrida, my son came down with his first cold.  Those first days were painful, struggling with the blue bulb to clear his passages.  And then it arrived... I tore open the package, all the while promising my skeptical husband that 'this will help--all the reviewers love it!!'  And it DID!  Man, we sucked some serious business from deep recesses.  He barely noticed the tip of it at the end of his nostril.  His eyes got really wide when he could feel the suction and seemed a bit freaked out but he got over it quickly when he felt the difference.  Now, a month later, he even smiles when we bring out the Nosefrida to give him some relief.    I know some other reviewers had trouble with the suction, so here's a few tips:  1. Be sure to spray some saline up the nostril 30 sec or so before you suction.  Breastfed babies especially have very sticky boogies so we have to moisten them up for removal.  2.  Be sure to listen for a 'click' when you attach the two pieces together, or else you won't get anywhere.  3.  Don't just hold it in one spot, move the tip a bit(circular motion is nice) b/c sometimes it makes a huge difference.    So that's it.  It's kinda weird, sucking things out of your child's face, but MAN IS IT WORTH IT!!!
B0058MIMNW|4|This is a bit expensive but it is really soft, fits my Crib perfectly, has multiple ties around it to secure it and is overall really great quality. I would recommend this as a bumper to put around the inside of your crib.
B006ZOIT7Q|2|Way too small for my 15 mo old had to return. She's also very petite so I was shocked when I tried it on a friends 4 month old and it just fit.
B002YQOVXU|5|I purchased this base so I could easily move my granddaughter to my car without taking my daughter's base out every time.  Well worth the purchase.
B002AWYDLS|5|Perfect gift for grandmothers who adore their grandchild. The picture window is a little small, but I think it focuses in more on the people and makes it go better with the frame.
B006WVC0X6|5|Easy to use and wash, but a bit warm to wear in Singapore. We use them on cooler days and as an overnight diaper. The one-size was a bit too big for newborn, but after about 6 weeks, they fit well. (newborn weight 7 lbs)
B004XS8X8Q|5|Best shower present ever according to friend this was given to.  She has been using it for 50 training and says it is great.
B0075LB4YS|5|Very nice for my grand daughters bedding. Even custom embroidered her name with correct spelling AND delivered ahead of schedule. Her room looks beautiful! I also was pleased that it is purple and brown..not black..so it's unique and it matches the furniture perfectly
B003N9M6YI|3|This was one of my son's favorite toys. And it did a great job of relieving his teething tension. Then one day I noticed that his teeth were scratching off the white paint on the red logo at the center of the main ring. Sine then, we have retired the toy since I do not want him eating the paint. It's too bad it was not constructed better since he loved it so much.
B000YRW34A|3|I visited a mattress store that carried these in the store so I got to try out this and another Naturepedic with springs that had a double set of springs. This one, I believe, has only one set of springs. It wasn't very comfortable in comparison to the set of 2 springs (thicker mattress). I highly suggest you find a local store that carries it before trying it out. We ended up with a latex bed for my son. Was much better but cost more.
B004BF774M|5|Really darling for a shower to clip to necklines.  NOT for any functional purpose tho as they are teeny tiny.  Cute color and only a few broken in the pack.
B00M1Y5ANK|4|Love this seat!  Install with ClickTight is a breeze.  It's \\"awesome\\" according to my 3yr old and is much improved over the older Britax seats we have (we have/had 4 others. Purchased between 2008 and 2014).  The fabric looks easier to clean and is cooler (important for us as we live in FL).  There's an extra support cushion for infants and extended RF for kids up to 40 pounds (considering switching my 3yr back). FF goes to 65 pounds or 49\\". My 7.5yr is still under the weight limit but is 3\\" too tall but this seat should get most kids to booster age for sure. I love the new click tight install. My only complaint would be if you are not planning on using the clickTight system and the latch instead.  The latch attachments are now similar to the tether and not the easy to use button style of the older Britax we have. These are a pain to uninstall and wouldn't recommend if you are installing and uninstalling the car seat regularly using latch. The latch also has lower limits than previously (under 40 pounds, don't have the manual with me), assuming that this is due to new safety standards. I love the upgrade in comfort and protection the ClickTight Installation is amazing. I received a manufacture date of 10/1/14 so I was rather impressed with the speed of delivery from factory to consumer.
B0043D28B4|5|arrived on time & as described
B003XMWF2S|5|great
B00I0M8SC2|5|My son has a cleft lip and palate and these have been great since his palate completely healed.  they don't spill and he's able to get fluid out without sucking too hard.  you can also remove the valve for full flow, which is of course a huge mess.  :)
B000LRGQ0A|2|When my niece was potty training 8 years ago, she had a similar potty chair by Safety 1st and I loved it. It was perfect! When I ran across this one for my son, I was excited thinking it would be just as good. I was wrong. First of all the &#34;lid&#34; design is terrible. You have to scoot the potty way away from the wall to even open it and then if the chair gets scooted back any, the sharp, hard plastic edge will scratch/cut your child's back. Then the foam ring is just set inside, not attached to anything, so my son likes to take it out and pretend like it's a hat, tire, etc instead of sitting on it. It has too many parts and it's ill designed. Find something else because this is just not a good potty chair.
B006VIJOPW|5|Geart! From the very beginning. I tried a lot of bottle, Dr. Brown, Avent, Playtex.<br />Baby prefer Born free. And I think it's really wonderful that we can also buy it overseas!<br />Great!
B002I1XHKY|5|It looks even better in person then on the picture :) its beautiful and will go perfect with my daughters crib. And  fast shipping.
B0038JE61O|5|Love this basket. I have used the muchkin brand in the past, but got frustrated by how little I could wash at a time and how the nipples would fall out. With this one and the fact it opens in the middle, allowing you to open only one side at a time is great. it is bigger than the munchkin brand one so be prepared to have less room in the top of your dishwasher, but the advantage is I can now wash 8 bottles as once. I say that is a win.
B003XMWF2S|5|My toddler loves these!
B007D1O834|5|This is a fantastic bath toy for kids of all ages. We first discovered this while visitng friends and then bought a set when we returned home. The colors are great and they provide endless fun for both our 6 month old and 2.5 year old. Love them!
B0006Q5602|4|My ds was kicking himself out of a swaddle in the hospital as a newborn, but when he was having trouble sleeping at 4 months, this helped.  He quickly outgrew it, but I'm definitely keeping this around in case we have another one!
B002JM4XGE|5|My 18 month old can use this bottle, no problem.  It is great to throw in my diaper bag, purse, or take with us on the stroller (and it actually fits in the cup holder!).  He is able to easily lift the top and close the lid.  Best part is, no spills!!  Would highly recommend!!
B0011Z166A|2|Yeah the Birdhouse is super adorable but that's it. It has a real terrible design. Since the music bars are on top and slant down either sides of the roof it was even impossilbe for me a grown adult to play a song. Not to mention the sound is terrible...My baby hates this toy because she can't play music but she likes to twirl the cute birdie. Get a flat xylophone. I was fooled by the cute looks of it.
B00821FLT4|4|I have been using the ubbi for 6 months and am very satisfied with it. First of all, it looks so much better than those plastic pails. I got mine at a local retail store with the orange color. It sits nicely in the nursery. Aside from the cuteness, it just works. No stinky smell at all except when you change the trash bag...but I don't know how you could avoid it with any diaper pail.<br /><br />I did read some other not so good reviews and luckily I've never had their problems. The ubbi holds up very well and it looks exactly the same compare to 6 months ago. I also never had a ripped diaper bag when pulling it out and we only change it once a week. I also buy the ubbi diaper bags as it is biodegradable.<br /><br />I give it 4 stars instead of 5 because the lock only works on the top opening but not the lid. So any toddler can easily open it up put his/her hands in it.
B000KJW4RI|4|I knew this would be an inexpensive crib, and it seems to work alright, I just wish they would have made a few cosmetic improvements to enhance it.  All of the bolts and screws are exposed, which looks really ugly on anotherwise nice looking crib.  It was not too hard to assemble, although the headboard part was hard to fit together.  On the backside it is really ugly, glad it faces a wall.  It will be a few years before we convert it to a daybed, hope it holds up alright.
B00V9AZCNA|1|Came in a plastic bag with no instruction.
B0028K2RN8|4|Excelente
B00GPWI7XE|4|The women who suggested amber jewelry for teething swore not only would it relieve the pain associated with teething, but also the drooling.  It definitely seems to be helping for his discomfort, but he's still working on filling a small swimming pool.  But, honestly, I don't mind the drooling as long as he's comfortable and happy, which he is.  And the bracelet itself is CUTE!  I'm a little jealous now and want one too!<br /><br />So, YAY! for pain relief, boo for drool.  But it's not like I can't wash his (and my) clothes.  Overall, great product.
B001FA0CP2|4|I'm happy I bought this bed knowing my baby would only be in it for a few weeks and didn't spend more than $30 on it.  I would definitely suggest a Moses Basket for any new parents.  Unless you like all the \\"frilliness\\" of a bassinet, I would recommend this basket.  Its simple and does the job.
B0081UBLNG|4|I used this travel system for all year. My son just transitioned from the infant carrier into big boy car seat. First, I'll comment on the carrier. Absolutely loved it! It is very comfortable, easy to clean, great color and comparing to other brands-not to heavy.It has deep hood (very rare) and protects from wind and rain. The cover is not neccesary, my son didn't like it. To short for newborn, you will be better off using just blanket. The infant insert is best I ever seen! It snuggles tightly around baby,very soft fabric and keeps head in place. When my baby growed out from it, I lended it to my friends with newborn (she purchased other brand and the insert was terrible) Car seat was very easy to install and the base for it is also great because it doesn't take a lot of space in the car. I would recommend you to buy frame \\" chicco snap to go\\" also which is great for short trips to the store.<br />About the stroller: I loved it as well! It reclines fully which is awesome because it let my baby take naps in it. Adjustable handle works great when you are climbing on a steep hill (I have one when going for a walks around my area)and adjustable hood becames handy when sun shines in baby's eyes. The stroller is not to heavy or bulky and folds almost flat comparing to other brands. And it's very easy to fold even with the one hand. The cover is washable and easy to put back on.<br />The only thing I don't like about this stroller is, that my baby who turned 1 barely fits in it!!! . Now when it's winter I can't buckle him in wearing his jacket. I have to roll up his coat in order to buckle him down. The side straps won't extend too much and they are very tight around his weist. And he is on a small side- just 19lb. Very dissapointed because now I need to look for another stroller with longer straps :(<br />Overall I would recommend this travel system but think twice if you are planning to use this stroller for toddler.
B007NG5UEU|4|Our old analog monitor that we got for $35 or so was great for the 3+years we used it, but one of the parent monitors went out and we really use both parent monitors in our house - one for the master bedroom and one downstairs for the living area.  I did a ton of research and decided on this one based on the decent price and good reviews.  There are 2 things that keep me from giving this 5 stars:  1) the nightlight feature is almost worthless.  I suppose it does it's job in so much as you can see light, but it's very, very dim.  2) Even at the highest sensitivity rating, it doesn't pick up every noise.  While a lot of people don't like to hear every little thing (and I know some people use white noise and don't want it picked up), I personally do.  I like to hear my baby girl breathing while she's asleep.  This does not pick up that sound, and the monitor is only about 2-3 feet away from her.  Otherwise, not an ounce of buzzing, hissing or static which I LOVE!  It has nice features for the price too.
B000J48DHE|5|I got this for my daughter to hang in the nursery for our granddaughter.  We love the colors against the pale wall.
B0073C4PS6|1|i do not like these no matter what i do the Popsicle never come out of the container.
B001CRLFU4|5|Wonderful purchase. Great ride!
B008CFR7AQ|1|One of the animals doesn't &#34;pop&#34;... The spring is broken. The animals are too heavy to go very high. I love the theme, though.
B00012CHFI|5|My wife and I purchased one of these and love it.  We were given one with our first child and its a great way to allow them to sleep in your bed, especially if you are concerned about rolling onto them in the middle of the night.  I feel like this is a must-have, especially for a first-time parent as you are probably worried about how they are sleeping, etc.  This doesn't force you to get out of bed to check on them and takes up a minimal about of space.  We also used it to transition them into a cradle/crib as it is a little softer than your standard crib mattress.
B004VL2VRY|5|I have just used this for two days now. Will update if anything changes but here are my thoughts so far.   Interference: None so far. we have three wireless computers, wireless speaker system and wireless phones and we live in a town house with at least 4 strong wireless signals around us. All the monitors we have had in the past have suffered from terrible interference and this one has nothing.   Sound: Very good. We have a noise maker in the room to drown out the city noise but I can still hear our baby very well, like I am in the room.   Video Quality: Fantastic. Depending on the placement of the camera, I can see our baby breathing even without the zoom.   Other Positives:  When running off the battery the screen turns off after 15 mins or so to preserve battery life.   Temp of room shows right on the screen.   You can talk to the camera if needed (although this just freaked out my 2yr old the first time I did it, and it is loud, so not really for lulling them back to sleep, more for a \\"just a second, I'm coming\\" kind of thing)  You can brighten the parent unit screen if the lighting is dim but not dark enough to turn on the night feature.  Very easy to figure out (no need to read the manual)  Negatives:   I have a two year old and have to make sure she doesn't get ahold of the parent unit as you can play music through the camera and talk through the camera (great features) but not so great while the baby is sleeping.   No clips on the parent unit, so you have to set it somewhere, but it does have a kick stand so you can see it propped up on the table.   Over all this is a fantastic unit and cheaper that other units that have the same features. The screen is plenty big enough  and you can set up the camera to see the whole crib so I am glad I didn't fork out the extra $50 to be able to pan the camera.
B00L9NR672|5|I love this diffuser!!<br />I purchased it last year and suddenly it stopped working.  I contacted the company and readily received a reply from Nancy, the co-owner.  She replaced the unit within a few days.  Their customer service is top notch!  I could not be more pleased with the product or Deneve!!
B0047GNVQS|5|This is a very secure base and it is very easy to click the car seat in and out of it.
B005XTKJAY|3|these break pretty easily.  i've been through about 4 of them now.  and they leak.  too expensive for this quality.
B000SEIQK4|5|This is a very cute product; not only for your child, but also for a Mother...for example , let's say, on Mother's day :-) The quality of this product is superb, colors are very nice and quietly vibrant; the song is well chosen. I would recommend this for your child or for someone you love :-)
B0091E31KM|5|Plug it in and pick your sound. My baby enjoys listening to the ocean to help her fall asleep. Works like a charm. Because of this, I downloaded a white noise app on my phone for in the car. She stops crying immediately.<br /><br />I like the small size. Doesn't take up too much space on the dresser. Some noise makers also come with iPod hookups or night lights - none of the extras are needed. This simple noise maker does exactly what it is intended to do, help my baby sleep.
B004EL6O1U|5|I'm a FTM and I got a few different brands/styles to try while on maternity leave. We decided to go w/pockets because of drying time and stuff -ability. These diapers work great at the sitter's because they go on and off just like a disposable. Yeah, they're a pain to stuff and unstuff, but it isn't a great big deal. We're 4 months in with no blowouts, smells or workmanship issues and we wash every 2 days. There's a reason these are so common/popular: they work. If you go with these, no worries.
B00GNOG8OY|5|Awesome. Gifted to my sister too
B00DAPI3M4|5|Insert fits perfectly in my car seat and adds great support for my newborn.  Highly recommend.  It's super cute also.
B004VL2VRO|5|My husband is one of those tech guys and came home with it...I was ticked off he spent $250 bucks on this thing.  I thought what an over priced thing.  However I have since changed my tune its a very nice monitor and I'm sure we will use it for years and years.  The color and night vision are great.  Controls are easy to use.  I love that it plays music, has a temp gage, and a 2 way speaker.  The baby can be in his room and I know he is safe, warm, and sleeping away. The only slightly annoying things are...the screen is bright in our bedroom at night and the price.  I guess you get what you pay for ...right?
B001IY4MUQ|3|First off, if your crib doesn't have a lip or edge to hold one side of the net on while putting on the other side, it is going to be next to impossible for one person to put the net on. Secondly, the bags included are handy but small and it is difficult to get the net in. Also, older babies that are able to stand up can remove the netting easily. They can also get trapped in the netting. So, this is only for bed babies. The quality is decent, it fits the sleigh crib well. I had some kind of allergic reaction when I removed each net (I have twins) so I'm not sure if it was dust or treated with a chemical. They probably will need to be at least rinsed in hot water before use.<br /><br />For my older babies, I am thinking about attaching short ties to each corner so I can tie the corners to the crib. I was hoping these would be good for not only mosquitoes but keeping the babies in the cribs. Even though they can climb out, they're too small for toddler beds and still need the security of a crib. I understand these nets are not for that purpose, but everything else I've tried hasn't worked.
B0055PITU8|1|was very very plain:( material was rough. the socks were good! i am a bit disappointed:( you couldnt even see the cross on the bib.. nothing like the pictures
B00CXGPNII|4|Seat cover isn't very stable, it moves when putting in it. It needs some sort of a pad on back for child's head. Other then that very nice and solid dark wood.
B00B1VUUTS|5|The flower is well made and shows up nicely through my front window for all to see! It is cute.
B0085CBA90|5|I pump from 3-4 times daily.  I tried every size pump flange there is for the Ameda Purely Yours except the smallest one with the areola stimulator because I know my nipples are way too big for that one.  I thought I would need the large since the large flanges were what I was using before finding these but I actually need a medium which fits in the standard flange.  Wish I'd bought these first before all the rest because I went through a lot of money trying to find the right fit.  I also do not use these the way they show on the Pumping Pals website.  I use them &#34;upside down&#34; it is the only way they work for me.
B002KKB94O|3|These sheets didn't wear very well after being washed. They are rough and not nearly as soft as some of my son's other sheets. For the price they are OK.
B003KMW4EA|5|excelente
B00H67AW4O|1|I purchased this item for my first granddaughter. Born 11/22/2014. The stocking says Baby's First Christmas 2013. 2013???? What the heck? Very embarrassed, since the item was shipped directly. Majorly disappointed.
B00LLRILXE|5|Worth the money. Really good. My daughther loves it.<br />Doesn't smell chemical or plastic at all.<br />Its pretty big big tok the wide and legth which is perfect
B004S8MGGQ|5|I am really surprised by how nice quality and soft this is- since maternity stuff seems to suck in general. The fabric is nice soft cotton and the design really is smart for different sizes and holding in the cups. A necessity for pumping!
B00K76TUWG|1|Bumkins covers have 5 snaps per side which is a giant pain the rear to try to attach on a squirmy infant.  10 snaps to do before it's secure on the baby!??  That's about 4-6 snaps too many.  I used them for a couple months, and got fed up with them.  I NEVER use these and wish I had never bought them.  On the other hand, I did not have problems with them leaking, so if you don't mind 10 snaps these will be fine.
B000NG7XGU|5|This monitor is absolutely fantastic.  We live in a rambling house that's well over 4000 square feet, and have several acres of property as well.  I believe the range of the monitor to be much more than the 900 feet claimed, as I have yet to go out of range while outdoors.  The monitor does take some getting used to, and you DO have to read the directions before use (as you should with ANY product), but once you understand the machine it's simple as pie to use and does its job perfectly.  Make sure to use rechargeable batteries ONLY, and charge the batteries and discharge them several times prior to use, as stated in the instructions.  We have had zero issues with battery life because we followed the instructions.     For those people complaining about not being able to hear their kid, I suspect that they did not understand the way the sensitivity adjustment works--you change it on the handset itself by pressing Sensitivity and then using the volume + or - buttons to adjust it.   We actually have to keep ours on 3 or 4 instead of all the way up, because it's so sensitive.    For the lady who complained that she didn't know her baby was awake because he didn't make enough noise:  no monitor is going to alert you to a silent but awake kid!  Count your blessings, LOL!
B00KZ1GTO0|5|Great oral stimuli for my kiddo while he watches tv, much better choice than his fingers.
B00AJSJFYA|4|This gate is very tall. It works great as a barrier between my living room and rarely used dining room however not a good option for a high traffic area as the gate is difficult to climb over (especially with baby in tow) and tough to take up and down.
B0070O8EFC|4|Just perfect for an infant who likes tags, it's small, lightweight and soft.  My 8-month-old can't make the center squeaker squeak yet, but I can do it for her.  It would be perfect if it was machine washable and had a slightly longer length to the clip
B002WN2C0E|5|I purchased two of these chairs for my twin grandchildren.  They are of excellent quality and construction.  More importantly they are well designed,    compact and easy to use.  They are also simple to put the babues into.  I think it was  wise purchase on my part and I enjoy seeing the babies    enjoy sitting ithem~
B006VFS97O|3|Seems a little bit bigger than the bottle neck, not used yet, hope it will be useful and cleaning easily.
B000J6CDY6|5|Excellent!!!!! Love it!!!!!!
B00DEQ88OW|3|Okay...
B000JOT2RO|2|The bowls stay put and are pretty cool for eating cereal. however it can backfire if you children get frustrated by not being able to move the bowl. My twins ripped the bowls off the table more then once and food flew each time. Also a lid only comes with one of the bowls. I thought that was really odd.
B004DC9TAI|5|very easy to use, to fold and unfold.  child seems quite comfortable.  good protection from top.  quite manoeverable.  useful for either running or walking.  nice color.
B00JN8YTBG|5|The color is really pretty and it sturdy!
B00PWKC32G|5|This is our twins first pillow (they're two), and they seem to really enjoy it. I also appreciate that is made in the US and is certified organic with no chemicals. This is a great first pillow for toddlers.
B001OB83EO|4|I like the gate. It was very easy to install. My only complaint is that I wish it was a few inches wider...I had to purchase the extension to make it fit properly. I plan to purchase another one.
B004PC9TV0|5|I love all Petunia Pickle Bottom, but this bag has definitely gotten a lot of use. I use it for everything! What I love most is that is can be folded up small to fit in my purse. I take it everywhere with me, and when I need it, I pull it out. I will probably purchase a few more. It is pricey as far as shopper totes go, but their quality, stylishness, and convenience because they fold up neatly are so worth the cost!
B00Q29MYOS|3|Like how soft the inside felt. Not so happy that they didn't have double gussets to help prevent leaks.
B005UV0UD6|5|i just got this today took about 10 minutes to put together and love it i have the matching travel system too...can't wait to use it when Aislyn is born in 6 weeks
B00H4E9WLI|5|I love this product! I wish I would have had it for all four of my children. There are many features on this chair that make it awesome! First let me start with the seat itself, it has an insert to make it bigger or smaller,  there is also a strap for your little one to sit safely without falling out or getting hurt if the tray wasn't on. That leads to another cool thing about this unique little chair. The tray comes off so you can use it for just a chair or somewhere for you little one to sit and play or have a snack. This is a must when adding supplies on your list for your little one!
B002YLMQ6Y|5|I am very happy with this product. I bought the entire bedding set and the lamp and the only piece missing was the rug.   The material and finish is excellent. Goes every well with numerous nursery themes like animals, alphabets, colors etc.   Looks great!
B00C72WZN4|5|We had a nice ceramic bank for our daughter but it broke when it slipped from her hands one day. Beyond her obvious sadness, being surrounded by ceramic shards was very dangerous and we decided to only get vinyl/plastic banks until she was much older. My husband found this in the store and she absolutely loves it. We've had it for two years, it's a great size, easy for her to pick up and put down, and not breakable. it's easy to put the money in but requires an adult to get the money back out (which we like). We're trying to find a plastic bank for our younger daughter now and haven't been able to find any in stores. So I'm glad Amazon carries it!
B0013F6SCA|5|very good！
B00175ROGU|1|This tube is very hard one. If you are looking for teething this are not good. My baby do not like it at all.
B007OZZ4JQ|4|So happy to find a stroller bag that isn't black or bright red. And my favorite color is green. I won't be traveling for a few months but glad I am prepared
B004J34TF6|5|I couldn't find these in the local stores so had to order it online. Happy they had it in stock.
B008BVY9CK|1|When adhesive sits in the package for a long time, it's no longer sticky. These don't BEGIN to work and I WILL be returning them.
B000M49MO4|5|Soy de Venezuela, excelente precio ya que aqui todo es carisimoooo, al bebe le encanto esta sonaja y la recomiendo.
B000046S3T|2|Three issues, one of which is likely my fault.<br /><br />1.  Extremely hard to open and I have very strong hands, abnormally strong.  I will say that I was trying to do this prior to installation so perhaps once installed, it is easier.  I didn't get that far so I can't say for sure<br />2.  It is not clear to me that these are for the &#34;old&#34; traditional style outlets, most of my outlets are the current &#34;decorative&#34; type.  they are rectangular and therefore, these covers are not compatible.  Why they don't have a photo of the inside or with the cover off puzzles me.<br />3.  It states no hardware is required but when trying to install on the few plugs I have that are the &#34;old style&#34;, if found that screw used to hold in the historic cover is far too small to accommodate this cover.  Not one thread catches.  It's no big deal if you have longer screws
B00N1V0TSS|5|Literally the only pacifier my son would take. We tried the soothes for weeks and a few others but her would only suck on my pinky. I decided to try these and he loves them. He was 8 weeks old and he finally took one.
B005IWM7V0|5|We've been using this bathtub since baby's first bath. The newborn sling was helpful for the first few weeks. I always felt like baby was comfortable and snug. Once he outgrew the sling (around 6 or 7 weeks) we have been using the tub with the infant bar. It mostly stops him from sliding down into the water, but he does get slippery and sometimes needs to be re-positioned . The tub has a drain at the bottom, but I usually just dump it out into the bathtub and then hang it from the shower curtain rod to dry. We haven't used the vibrating function since baby likes the bath without it.
B00C3WDY4W|1|I received the magnetic letters shoved into the small package.  You can tell immediately the letters were used and not new as advertised.  Most were so dirty and I just threw them away.  Very gross!
B0097D4ZMU|2|I should have read the bad reviews before I bought this.<br /><br />The sounds are fine, the main issue is the batteries - if you need to leave it on all night, expect to get about 3 nights.<br /><br />The alternative would be if the timer lasted long enough to be useful - but it lasts 5 (or maybe 15) minutes - how about long enough for the baby to fall asleep, like 45?
B00BNZ8XM8|2|la tela se rompio la misma semana y mi bb pesaba 7 kilos
B00DYOQKJO|5|The bottles in this line are easily kept clean, easy to put together, and anti-colic. In other words, these bottles are part of a great line I love.
B008MGZCKW|5|We love it!
B00AJSIXUC|2|For the price it's decent enough. It was easy to install, but its a lot lower than our Britax Marathon, so my son complains because he can't see out the window very well.<br /><br />Also, the bottom buckle is a huge pain in the arse. It is really difficult to buckle and I get extremely frustrated at times because it takes so long. Not looking forward to buckling my son in once rainy season hits.<br /><br />Also, the top buckle is too easy to buckle and I worry about it loosening up over time.
B003TQXGJ4|5|Love turtles and love this! It goes very nicely with my baby's room which is also decorated in this room theme!
B00GJGA9GY|5|These nesting boats are a great addition to our tub toys. Fun in or out of the tub. Best of all they can be cleaned easily. No worry about mold ever hiding anywhere.
B0094CTX9E|4|Great. Arrived on time, is as expected.
B009H5ZNV0|5|Love the way this looks in our baby's nursery. It seems really well made and I love all of the colors.
B0015R8B7Q|3|My son loves mickey mouse and I love that the lid is only 1 piece.  However, they leak
B00PSTIUEQ|5|This made a perfect gift for my friend who transitioned her baby to more solid food. This is very well constructed and a great size. Love that it can be suctioned to a surface so the child can not knock it off but is easily removed by an adult. The spoon and fork are proportioned well as to not have overly large bites for mothers feeding their child or a toddler learning to feed themselves.  It also registers high temperatures as not to cause any burns to the baby's mouth.  Over all this is an outstanding product and was greatly appreciated as a gift!  Was so happy when this was offered as part of a company promotion for honest reviews.  My friend is very happy with it and suggested they definitely make it in blue for those baby boys!
B00GVFF16Q|4|These bottles worked amazingly for us. My 2nd daughter didn't like Dr. Brown bottles for whatever reason. She constantly spit up with them. I tried other bottles too, nothing was working. I started doing research about bottles and got these to test out. They worked wonderfully. The only thing I wish the makers thought of, is making the nipple on the side of the nipple peace because unless the bottle is upside down (which is difficult in multiple situations to have a baby in a perfectly flat position) there remains around an oz in the nipple. And whether it is formula (which costs around a dollar an oz) or breast milk (all the effort we put into drinking enough and pumping the milk) it is a valuable liquid to waste..<br /><br />But the clean up is a breeze! Especially compared with Dr. Brow which has 6 different parts to clean every time. Just make sure the nipple is flat inside the screw on part or the milk will drip.
B00GRS9T10|5|Gift for my newborn grandchild. Have bought other Mary Meyer stuffed toys over the years and appreciate the quality.
B006Z6E8AG|5|excellent article. thanks for sending, it was in the time I expected, its use has helped me to streamline my work either at home or in the trabajo.Su operation is perfect.
B00PQ7MICK|5|Great product.  Really sticks to the wall and plently of room for bath toys
B00005NUNL|1|I've bought tons of stuff on Amazon and this is the first time I ever felt the need to post a review to warn people away from something.    These latches look fine but have a fundamental design flaw. The slope where the two plastic pieces come together isn't correct. If you position the pieces properly so the drawer won't open unless the latch is pushed down to clear the lip, then the drawer won't close smoothly on it's own. You have to push the latch down when you're CLOSING the drawer as well, which clearly isn't what people are expecting (or what the designers intended). I tried many tiny adjustments in the positioning and found none where the drawer closed smoothly but remained secure when closed.    Insanely bad design. If the plastic pieces were sloped just a bit differently, it would work fine. What were they thinking?
B0057EEC44|5|Great product
B0018S25B0|2|When purchasing this pair of underwear I assumed it was a three pack.  I have never seen training pants sold individually.  When this single pair arrived I was beyond disappointed.  The underwear themselves are of good quality but not worth what I paid.  I feel I was cheated.  This should be stated and it wasn't!
B007ETJQP0|5|Lots of buttons to push, same size as daddy's iPhone and is bilingual. He plays with it all the time.
B0009RNXNA|5|Nice quality travel bag. It is very large! It easily fit our Britax infant car seat and then some (we put our Boppy pillow and some other baby items inside with our car seat)! My husband loved the backpack feature and the padding.This bag is great for travel, as well as, for storage purchases.
B0064CTIC4|3|Update!: Only after one use this duck stopped working properly unfortunately. I loved the concept and how it worked the first time. But then the light wouldn't turn off even when completely dry. Then next time I used it, it wouldn't register the right temperature. It stayed blue and \\"cold\\" even when I heated the water way beyond a comfortable heat level. Although it does work periodically, I don't feel safe having it in the bath with the little ones. :(<br /><br />We have been using the ducky for about a week now and my little ones love it! I like that the light is bright enough to see with bold numbers that are visible when standing above the tub, and it reads the temp immediately after being placed in the water. Also love that it doesn't appear to have a way to mold (no holes in it) like traditional rubber duckies. I'll always test the water first myself of course just to be sure, but it's nice to have that added piece of mind.
B0012BWUDQ|4|I bought this seat for my potty-training 2.5 year old boy.  Yes, the hole in the seat is a bit large for the little guy, but better than the full seat, and he and baby brother will \\"grow into it\\" in the years to come.  I'd like to see handles on the side.  It is plastic, and the lid and child's seat takes up more space when lifted for adult use, so as other people have commented, large people will rub up against the back (*ewwww*).  We are \\"normal-sized\\" and have not found any problems with the plastic holding our weight or bumping the back.  I like this better than having to do the shuffle with removable seats.  Especially nice for our main floor bathroom, which our adult guests use.  We have had this seat about 3 weeks, now I will order another one for the upstairs kid's/guest bathroom.
B002G9UTMC|5|this is great!! it`s large enough to wait my dirty clothes to be cleaned in the roller coaster!!<br /><br />if u need it just get it, because there`is nothing bad about it
B0080D5982|5|Daughter loves it....even has fallen asleep in it
B000W5P80A|5|I initially got this for my peg perego switch - i needed some extra storage for wipes/diapers and some basic infant essentials - things I knew I'd need ALL the time and used this saddle bag as my \\"back up\\" in case I forgot it (prone when you're a new mommy). Since my son has grown we've switched to a lightweight stroller - well with a lightweight stroller you give up storage - not with the saddlebag.<br /><br />I've now attached this to the handlebars - across the BACK of my peg perego aria as an organizer (this stroller is too short in depth to use a saddlebag). SO USEFUL!! I now have full size storage in a lightweight stroller.<br /><br />I highly recommend this as an add on to umbrella/lightweight strollers - you may give up storage in the under carriage - but this makes up for it!! Keep your items stored and secured and easy access. The velcro straps are long enough to attach to almost any size stroller - my lightweight is pretty wide and I still have about 3 inches of velcro left on each side.
B00GD0ZSOY|1|If I could rate it lower I would. First of all the Zipper is from top to bottom so I am not sure how you would ever get your baby in and out of this easily, you have to put it over their head. Second, the zipper broke after I washed it once, my daughter never even got to sleep in this thing.  And they didn't let me return it because I bought it so long ago before my daughter was born and didn't realize it was useless until right now. My advice to this company is to turn your Zipper around and make the arm holes bigger and use a YKK zipper so they don't break so easily.
B00003TL7P|5|I am the mother of 9 children and this is the easiest diaper pail I have ever used.  It captures odors and it uses regular trash can liners so I don't have to buy any custom can liners, which saves me money and time.
B00CWN8IK2|5|One of the best humidifiers I have found. Not a hot steam, so little fingers won't get burnt or hurt. It can definitely put out quite a bit of moisture in the air if your not careful. The high setting is definitely high and great for larger areas, but the low setting is great for smaller areas. Plus you can't beat the price of under $30!
B00C6AU9FI|2|It is a decent bag, but not big enough for all that is needed for a toddler.
B005WPPT54|5|Great bag! I use it as a school bag and the pockets work great! Sturdy handles are a great addition!
B0096TK3P8|3|Fast delivery, item as described.  I ordered several of these throughout the year I was nursing (partly because I kept leaving them places.)<br /><br />It did the job, I just didn't like that I could not boil or steam sterilize (tubing turns white and stays white.)  The tubing did pop-off from the little piece (cannot think of what it is called at the moment.)  They also look &#34;cheap&#34; compared to Medela brand (not sure if I can trust the &#34;no BPAs&#34; label.)<br /><br />This product does the job, but you get what you pay for.
B0049U1VQ4|5|Love this belt!  Perfect for my son.  He has just turned 2 and we've been using it for months.  Easy to pull pants up and down without removing belt for diaper changes or potty training.  Does not get in his way but is effective to keep his pants up!  Easy to wash, easy to wear.
B00CAFTX2Y|3|For the price, it's functional enough as a bath mat.  The material is soft but also thin.  I didn't buy the rug because of the print, although the colors go with our bathroom.  There is an annoying crease in the center that won't seem to flatten out.
B006Y7P1CK|5|This bag is precious, well made and package very attractive!  Bought as a shower gift and everybody loved it!  Would definitely buy from Three Strouts again!
B000056JB8|5|Good little tub. Fits just fine in our American Standard regular tub. Little man sometimes pulls the drain plug, so make sure that it is pushed all the way down. The tub is slightly wedge shaped, to help \\"lock it in\\" to your tub. We have been using it for 5 months with no problems, little man is now 1 year.
B00SXF5RUC|2|Item came pretty fast however it came a bit dirty and had white stuff over it<br />Also very large it looked way too big around the neck
B007J6W14Q|3|It looks nice and material is fine. If you're not carrying a lot of things it should be good.<br /><br />Changing pad is good for new born but not baby 6 months and older, because the pad is too small and it also slippery. If you travel for a long period of time and need to carry a lot of diaper, bottles or formula, you won't have enough room for it.
B00FOTOWOC|5|I just loooove my powder! This is the first powder i have found that is truly natural! I am on a path to wellness, and this powder is very beneficial for me. I highly recommend it!!!!😊
B0015A4FO6|5|We have owned five of the \\"regular\\" cotton swaddles, and they work great! We had to replace them after about two months of use because they shrank and the velcro started to wear down. I bought one of these because I read that it has a bit more stretch to it, and it most definitely does. My son is about 17 pounds now and this will fit him for another couple of months (he just LOVES to be swaddled). This will fit him longer than the non-organic swaddles. So far, after about ten washes, it's held up well. If your baby is on the larger side, this is a great option!
B001CUPT3K|4|good size for my Graco system covers every thing. ,  but it has plastic smell thats hard to remove
B00CWN3FNM|5|My babe y so happy when he plays on it, the product is very safe for my babe, I'm very conform
B00DOGUZ3Y|5|Good quality materials, do what they are supposed to do.  Very pleased with them.  Have had them for three months.
B005BPDLQ4|5|Works just like the original camera that came with the set. We needed another one for our second child. The money is definitely worth the peace of mind to SEE our baby. The cameras will come in nicely when they are older as well.
B00081L2SU|4|I bought this for my grand-daughter so she could keep her little girl close to her when grocery shopping or going out into a parking lot.  She is 19 months old and can run as fast as the wind.  I think it is a great safety feature.  Originally her dad thought it was mean to use it, but when he saw how fast she could escape, he changed his mind in a hurry.
B00B0Z5KR2|5|The friend I bout them for loved them. She said they are cute and soft for her baby. I recommend these ..
B00MKVCFYG|5|Our 5-month-old has been using the Halo cotton sleepsacks for about a month now. They're soft and warm and have washed pretty well, although they did shrink a bit at first. It's nice to know that our son can't kick these off in the night- he usually wriggles out of regular blankets within 2 or 3 minutes.
B00H9IBWTO|5|The product works exactly as they said it would.<br />Easy installation.<br />The installation instructions were clear and concise.<br />No more bumps on the head.
B002WN2BY6|3|PROS:<br />- Within range = crystal clear communication<br />- capable to use as walkie talkies<br /><br />CONS:<br />- Over 50ft apart = poor reception<br />- No indication of low battery... have to charge constantly to be sure its on all night.
B00BJCO99Q|2|I recently had my first child. To cut down on expenses, her dad and I decided to try out cloth diapers. Chunk cloth diapers are comparable to the name brand ones we have been using, but are cheaper!!!!  I really like that the waist band can be made super tiny to fit my skinny baby's waist.....update 6 months later....the 2 chunk diapers I bought no longer are useable. The elastic broke in one and the water proof liner in the other one has separated from the diaper...making it useless:(
B00081J3N6|5|I ordered several of these to use all over the house. The fit very well, and look great. I can now worry a bid less when my baby gets close to an outlet.
B0043XHUYO|5|It was so soft and fuzzy, I gave it as a gift and she loved it.  I used it for a diaper cake.
B005FPT51K|5|This camera is easy to set up and use if you take two minutes to follow the directions. You can use the software that comes with it for basic set up, but you can then peek at the settings and use that to point your web browser to the built in web-enabled control screens for more options. It's very useful to be able to see and hear what is going on at home using the iPhone app. Be sure to change the password to something besides the default for security.<br /><br />Update 2017.07.25: two iBaby M3 cameras have been in use continuously since August of 2013 (four years). We use them for elder care purposes. If you connect some low-cost self-powered speakers the two-way audio can be useful when interacting with home care nurses. It takes a little Googling but you can use port forwarding on your home router plus dynamic DNS as one way to make the camera accessible from outside the home. The iBaby app is ok, but we have used the FoscamPro app to view and control multiple cams (iBaby M3 can be added as if it is a Foscam FI8910W).<br /><br />Both power plugs failed recently within weeks of each other. An affordable replacement is<br />https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00DTOYN3Y/
B003ZDK1US|4|Very easy to push
B000BK8QRS|3|We got this as Tigger is our 16 month old son's favorite.  The pictures are nice and colorful.  It works very well as a spill proof cup as we have not seen any water spill out of the cup.  But it certainly seems to require little more effort for our son to suck out the water compared to other spill proof cup.
B001G87KYE|2|The product is much harder to use than you would think. Had to give away. Trying to keep the string on the nipple while struggling with your baby to suck on it was no fun.
B002MG5YF6|5|These looked lovely on the gifts.  My daughter and I were very happy with the outcome. we will order again.
B007ZZH7YK|5|My daughter is in LOVE with this little puppy! It has been everywhere and through everything..She is always playing with it whether it is with her dolls or other stuffed animals! I would definitly recommend this toy!
B0028H3ACS|5|I got this as a gift for a sweet little girl.  My god son had one and loved it.  I think she will too!
B0038JDVCY|5|helps out a lot love using it a must have for newborns
B00FZGLPDA|5|I have tried several bottle brushes and I like this one the best. Others have had sponge-like material on top that rips and wears out. The smaller nipple brush is perfect, which the other brands did not have.
B001I463GM|5|This has been awesome. Our two year still sleeps well in it when we have company staying over or when we go places.
B002WB1432|5|I am happy with the glider but was upset at the hoops I had to go through after I realized that I would only be receiving the gilder and NOT glider and ottoman (what is shown in the picture).  Instant message chatted with a customer service agent and called an agent who both agreed that the picture was deceiving but did not offer a solution.  I was so upset.  This is for my first baby and the ottoman is needed so that we will be comfortable.  After about two hours on the phone I asked if they could fiscount the glider and I would purchase the ottoman separately.  Which still hasn't shipped or arrived.  The baby is due any day and I still don't have the ottoman for the nursery that I order only a few days after my original purchase. Glider works great and is very comfortable.  Just upset with the amazon side or the order.
B00BFBUYAO|5|Amazing.... The short term answer to my exhaustion problems.  Do I think this sucker is worth $300?  Big. Fat. NO.  Did I care when I ordered it?  NOPE.  People will do anything for a baby to sleep.  ANYTHING.  Luckily, this sucker can be turned into a bassinet and a play yard for my daughter.  So I guess I wasted $200 on a pack 'n play she'll never use. :/
B006YPTWHC|5|My exclusively breast fed 6 month old decided that she would NOT take a bottle for anything.  She had an occasional bottle as a newborn, which she took just fine, but it had been a few months since she had had a bottle, and wouldn't take the Avent bottles we had been using and would just scream in hunger and frustration.  After reading reviews, I decided to give this a try, as I have a wedding to attend soon, and will be needing to leave my 6-month old for most of the day.  She took this bottle!  I couldn't believe it!  The nipple is softer and more flexible than the Avent nipples, so I am guessing it mimics the breast better than a normal bottle nipple.  It took a few minutes for her to accept it, but when she did, she just drank away.  By the way, she is my 4th, and I never had any problems with my first 3 babies taking the occasional bottle.  So, if you have a baby who is rejecting normal bottles, give this a try!  I will be ordering one more as a back up.
B006YYCL1M|5|Purchased this as a shower gift for the new baby of a firefighter.  Too cute for words!  Would highly recommend!
B00IVNEFAY|5|My son loves his toy! It makes him giggle!
B0015R2AWI|5|We love this blanket! A must have! Soft, organic cotton. Washes up easily. It is stretchy, which I found to be easier for swaddling.
B00BMK0NQI|2|Nice quality and does exactly what it advertises but it's a waste of money. Used it for maybe a month and my daughter hated it. Apparently you can get the same results from a rolled up towel.
6065005118|5|beautiful to no end.  I thought i was gonna be disappointed but i am more than thrilled with the prodect
B007VBYVVA|5|I use these on my guns.  They are great for laying out on my work bench.  I can wipe and clean at the same time.  Plus these are used which means they have ben washed many times and they are as soft as a babys butt!!
B0038JE60U|5|This drying rack is great. We use it every day when we wash our baby's bottles. Our baby is breastfed, so we have lots of bottles and pump parts to wash, and the rack is ideal for drying all of it. We use the Dr. Brown bottles for feeding and all of the pieces fit along with storage bottles and all of the little pieces for the breast pump. It is pretty big, but I love the size because everything fits. Highly recommended if you don't mind taking up some counter space.
B0046RDGMM|5|Love the toy box.   The colors are beautiful, the box is easily cleaned, and is very sturdy. The material used to make it is a great quality and the box itself is very sapcious. Love that is a bit heavy to move so my kids cant move it around and when they stand on it, I know it won't move anywhere
B0077P3U8A|5|Everything was great, the Swivel Glider and the shipping
B006ZVV0R0|5|The Britax B-Safe car seat is amazing in that it's rated for babies as small as 4 pounds, but while babies that small will certainly fit in the car seat, their heads will roll all over the place with the provided support pillow. Our little guy was 6 lbs 3 oz when we left the hospital so this pillow was a great help in keeping him safely supported in his car seat. It's crash-rated when used with the Britax car seat too, so it's totally safe to use and won't void your warranty if there is, god forbid, and accident.
B00DAH0X5W|5|I wasn't  familiar with breathable bumpers as a first time mom and when one of my friends told me about them they also told me they were a bit pricey. I began my search and Amazon had  the best price, even $10 less than Walmart. I ordered it right away and it arrived within a week. I was thrilled. My little girl is now safe and sleeping in her big girl bed, and even better.....mommy and daddy get sleep. LOL! I would highly recommend this product especially at this price.
B00U6G6YCG|5|I love it. I feel confident that my child's bottles and toys are clean with this. There is no waxy or white soap residue as with some other soaps. It leaves no scent either though it smells good while I'm using it. Its also gentle on my hands.
B00CXVKPTK|2|There is nothing special about this teether.  The product description said it helps babies get ready for chunkier solid foods but I don't see how.  My son has shown little interest in this item.  I would not recommend, especially for the price.
B00BH0RJW4|5|wish they had this when my son was born as he could have used it. a friend gifted us this with our second baby--it is perfect because it is lightweight and can be moved easily from room to room. with more than one kid, you need a few more spots to lay baby down safely. my daughter loved this because of the rocking motion and incline, which helped with her reflux. i recommend this to all of my new mommy friends and plan on using it again with our next baby!
B005BW1RL8|5|My son loves it!
B00NEPTYEQ|1|Not right size that it says it is or shows
B00CXVI4M0|5|love the over the window design so you can actually put the window up or down.  much better than the other window shade options.  helps keep the sun out of my baby's eyes.
B00E4USQ94|5|Work as described, very useful for my little girl and stops underwear touching the seat as well as having a decent area for her to grip on to.  Recommend this and wish I had found it sooner.
B00I3X6EE2|5|I winced at the price but it is so worth it. I bought this intending to use it under my baby's high hair, but it's been so invaluable everywhere else that it hasn't made it to the dining room yet...I'm going to have to buy another one for the high hair. My baby has open eczema rashes on his face and feet, and when on the carpet he uses the carpet to rub against to scratch his itchies... and ends up with carpet fibers in his sores. :( I've tried other play mats and picnic blankets, but either they aren't easily washable or are washable but get dragged around as he plays. This mat is heavy enough that he can crawl and roll on it without it moving, and it is so easy to clean - just wet wipes or a few sprays of Branch Basics. I've used it as a play mat and a picnic mat - spilled water rolls right off. I love the matching travel pouch it comes in - we are taking this with us to my mother-in-law's as well as on vacation for hotel rooms and parks.
B00389VFH2|5|I usually buy the biodegradable option, but these were a little less expensive. They seem a bit stronger and hide the odor better than the bio option.
B00CBVHLW6|4|My daughter loves this little elephant, we use it at bedtime.  The music is nice, and it has a variety of different options.  I love that the button is large enough that she can turn it on by herself.
B001AG2BF0|5|I bought this pacifier holder, because I needed a second holder when one is dirty.  This holder is much better than the Munchkin holder I bought first!!! The Munchkin holder only has velcro, so if the baby tugs on the pacifier, they are able to detach it from the holder.    I like this holder not just for daycare, but also while we are out and about. It keeps the pacifier close by without worrying it will hit the ground, or another child taking the pacifier.  The holder has gotten daily use with no problems!
B00D9X8WWI|1|These aren't absorbent. They're a very counterproductive solution to the problem of leaking breasts. Aesthetically, they are also unpleasant - as they do not fit the contours of your body. Disposable nursing pads, though more costly, were a better alternative for me.
B000NM3DFY|2|Not really functional. My son doesn't pee too often while changing, so I lucked out. He does pee every time I bathe him, but we are already in the tub, so I don't worry about this. These are more fun than functional.
B00MAWZ7CW|5|It's great. I love it, very cushioned and soft. Good price as well.
B004LE8T9A|4|I am a lazy mother.<br /><br />Or, at least, most baby books make me feel that way.  I don't record the date I first felt my baby kick, and I have no idea what the first song was that my precious little one heard.  Both of those questions are asked in the [[ASIN:0763619094 Guess How Much I Love You:  My Baby Book]] that I have for my second-youngest son.<br /><br />I like that the pages in this book are three-hole punched and removable.  Unfortunately, they're double-sided.  Removing the page for the newspaper announcements also means removing the other side, one that might have a growth chart or room for writing about coming home from the hospital.<br /><br />The Pooh illustrations are absolutely lovely; the cloth cover is much higher-quality than many baby books, and overall the questions aren't ridiculously detailed.  It's a good baby book, but there will, alas, be some gaping holes for my baby to see just-how-attentive his mother was with baby number four.
B00929WQGG|5|Nice comforter, the colors are very neutral and the different patchwork materials give it visual interest. Just be careful when ironing the bed skirt, the portion that lays under the mattress will melt with a hot iron.
B003RKLUJU|3|Worked okay, only was able to get some of the mucus out. Wish the tip would have been a little mor narrower.
B00C5921A6|2|One of the side supports wasn't even attached to the top. Will be contacting Amazon for a replacement or something, I hope. We used it 2 times before noticing that the side wasn't put together properly and it wasn't very noticeable until my daughter stood up on that side and the side collapsed. Not safe. Not cool.
B000NPNV9Y|5|I love this stroller.  I have several strollers and by far this is the one that I reach for when traveling.  It folds up so nice and easy, it is very light and best of all my daughter loves it - she sleeps really well in it!  We bought it primarily for traveling around Europe and it works great....very easy to get on subways and buses and is a fairly smooth ride on cobblestones (compared to other umbrella strollers).  Really happy I purchased this stroller
B002SW3BWW|1|The zipper is incredibly flimsy.  I read prior reviews that mentioned this, but I generally like the Aden + Anais products, so I thought I'd just give it a try.  The zipper ripped open while my 6 month old was sleeping in it and he got tangled in the sack. He's fine but these sacks are dangerous.  I would never, ever put my child in something like this.
B000LEI82W|1|PLEASE DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT.  BABY TREND IS A MISERABLE COMPANY TO DEAL WITH.  My wife and I purchased this stroller from Amazon.com within the last three months.  It pulls to the left when you are pushing it.  Not a horrible thing, but still defective.  What is horrible is the customer service that we have received from Baby Trend.  First don't even try calling them, because every time you call you will be put on hold for 10 minutes and then told by a recorded message that they are experiencing higher then normal call volume and you're hung up on.  Second, if after three days of trying like we did and you get through, they'll basically tell you sorry nothing we can do.  PLEASE DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT.  BABY TREND IS A MISERABLE COMPANY TO DEAL WITH.
B00499DRY4|4|I love this stroller! We have owned many strollers in the past (graco, baby trend, Costco and jeep) and this is by far the best one. It is to easy to steer even with only one hand. It maneuvers great on any surface - indoors, outdoors even grass. I love how easy the seat is to reverse. It only takes a second. It also folds up really easily. Plus is has cup holders. The only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is because it is a little heavy. Not so heavy that I can't carry it but its definitely a heavier stroller. And it does take up quite a bit of space.
B00GBZ6VDS|5|i love that this comes in so many colors
B002WD9NY2|3|I was excited to get this one thinking it was going to be as soft as the pea pod organic cover, however it's not and after the first wash the color from the brown piping along the edge bled onto the white cotton.  This was despite me washing it in cold water and very little soap.  Just a warning.  I wish they had more options for the organic cotton covers.
B00KD5YQVG|5|I would recommend this pillow to anyone!! My son actually slept until 8.30 am this morning!! That's unheard of!! This luxury pillow is well worth the money, it's so soft and washable!!! The customer service is second to none! Very happy customer!
B009QBRSQI|5|These are so cute.  They are for my Grand-daughter that will be coming to visit.  A special gift from her Gramma :)
B00BF138T8|5|We had a previous version of this same giraffe. I bought this as a replacement because we lost the original. It was better than the first!!!!
B000056OUG|5|With my first baby, I did not bother to purchase a sterilizer because I planned on breastfeeding mostly and did not think it would be worth the money to invest in a sterilizer.  I thought I'd just use the big pot on the stove and boil all my bottle and breastpump parts when necessary.  And that's just what I did.  I saved my money. . .  BUT let me just say, I melted numerous pacifiers, bottle parts, and got sick of having to worry about all the bottle/pump parts burning up or always getting them out of the pot and drying them on a clean towel on the countertop.  (I pumped often to build up a good frozen supply of milk, so my pump parts were always in need of washing it seemed.)  My countertop looked like a bottle factory ALL the time.<br />So with Baby #2, I decided to make the investment in this sterilizer.  It has been absolutely wonderful!  It saves time (no worrying about the pot on the stove burning up parts and bottles - I can leave the parts in the sterilizer for quite a bit of time before I have to worry about removing them) and space (my countertop stays neat).<br />Certainly, you ought to at least wash your bottle and pump parts in sudsy water/rinse them clean before you put them in the sterilizer.  But if you're going to sterilize, you might as well get this one.  It's worth the money.<br />My sister melted (literally melted and evaporated) 3 bottles and their counterparts while sterilizing them on the stove top recently. . .  She had fallen asleep while her infant was napping (new parents can be so tired).  Let's just say, she went out immediately after that incident and purchased this sterilizer and loves it.<br />Personally, I think this sterilizer gives me less details to worry about when I already have so many little things to worry with.<br />I love it and recommend it.  (I do use Avent bottles and Pump-In-Style pump parts.  I've also sterilized sippy cups for my two year old in this!)
B00186YZ74|5|I am a first-time mom and was looking for a diaper bag that doesn't look like a diaper bag and also would look good on my husband too. Plus, it needs to be in good size and easy to use. This is the one I found and I am very happy with this purchase. Thanks for everyone's reviews that help me to make decision to purchase. It is as good as everyone said about it. It has all the space for my newborn and myself. It is sturdy, good quality and in perfect size - no too big not too small. Easy to access stuffs. I feel very organized. It looks good too! I also have purchased Skip Hop Studio bag. It is also a great bag.
B001V8MTBI|5|I purchased this for my daughter who is having her second child, my first grandson. She lives in a small apartment. This has a pack and play, changing table and basinet in one. Graco products are great I purchased for my other 2 grandchildren.My daughter loves it and the fact it has a diaper stacker at the end also she said is a plus.
B00F2MQ258|5|I really liked the design and quality of this item.  Purchased it as a baby gift but the recipient already received one.  I'd been told babies love this, grow with it and it must be so since they're a very popular gift.
B000BNQC58|4|Pretty nice item we had to purchase to replace a similar product from other manufacturer. This one only turns off and on in 3 different colors and nothing else special.
B00CP75A6U|5|Awesome value . My four year old boys love them. Well made and a very nice touch to a boys bedroom.
B000GKU7C0|5|Very happy with this little toothbrush.  Our daughter took to it right away and it seemed to relieve some of the soreness from her new teeth.
B00BI2VF3U|5|came in excellent condition. Perfect size for baby food portions.
B0085E0ALC|5|These blankets are so much more beautiful in person! The material feels like cotton/silk and the quality is really good! They are thin enough to wrap tightly, but thick enough to provide some warmth.<br /><br />The quality of these is much better than the version at Target. I absolutely love these blankets and am so happy that I bought them!!
B005BWXJ8W|5|This works great and it is super soft. My daughter was chewing all of the finish off of her crib and this worked like a charm. The dark brown looks really nice if you have a dark wood crib finish. I bought two (one for each side).
B001LQCOIS|2|I was really excited to use this - great concept - and initially liked it, but quickly realized it was a waste of money.<br /><br />The pros:<br />- does a good job of steaming the food to the correct consistency (not too hard but not overcooked)<br />- good for when you initially have no idea how much water to use, how long to cook things, etc.  you learn quickly though.<br /><br />The cons:<br />- the chopping blade is pretty crappy and will only work for watery/thin foods (pears, peaches, etc) - it does not work well on grittier and thicker foods like peas and sweet potatoes.  I ended up constantly using my regular food processor instead and it pureed much better.  but then i had to clean an extra appliance.<br />- the plastic bowl (the all the accompanying parts) just seem really thin and cheap. you can't wash it in the dishwasher, further leading me to realize that its kind of junky material (especially for the price)<br />- it makes a very small amount of food<br />- the instructions are completely lacking on how to cook frozen food (such as frozen peas, because who the hell has time to shell fresh peas with an infant)<br />- it did not work well to reheat previously cooked food - its much quicker/easier to just put refrigerated food into a hot water bath<br />- there are definitely some weird mineral deposits/spots in the water reservoir that didn't go away even after descaling with white vinegar.  and i only used if a few times before the spots appeared.<br /><br />save your money and just use a steamer insert in a pot and a food processor.
B00GZFNHOA|5|Very nice
B0045KOK16|4|cute, straight cut crib skirt. It isn't as dark gray as the picture appears, but it matches ok with all the other grays.
B0088UXLSW|4|Love it but fabric coming apart already on the sheet that came with it and only used 2 times.
B001CWDJ58|5|super soft and comfy.This bumper is better than the breathable bumper, which never stayed in place and my baby was always bumping his head. This bumper gives support, stays in place, and is very soft
B0051RIDNI|3|This is OK..  I was disapointed in the color.  The pink is really not a pink it's more of a purply pink color
B005XJ2VGY|5|Excellent product. Ready to go as soon as opened from the box. The item is exactly same as described.
B00FN6J2LO|5|The kids love it
B0011URFRE|4|Love this car seat and its flexibility!  The only thing I don't like is that it doesn't have good head support if your child falls asleep while sitting in it!
B00FAYEE0I|5|This crib set is gorgeous, it's so pretty for any little girl. It had everything needed including the bumper pad! And the price couldn't be beat, I looked everywhere. This was the best. I'm very happy.
B007NG5UF4|4|The VTech audio monitor has been a great replacement of the old monitor I had. The battery (singular as there is no battery for baby monitor and must be plugged in at all times) is rechargeable with the provided power adapter. There's a &#34;push-to-talk&#34; button on the parent piece as well. Not only that, but the baby piece has a soft orange glow ring to act as a night light if need be.<br /><br />Pretty much all the information you see above is correct and works great. I'm not sure if they had one with 2 parent monitors, but my wife now considers buying that one.<br /><br />One thing that I didn't enjoy was the battery life of the parent monitor. It's rechargeable, which is a good thing, but I feel that the battery doesn't last as long as it should. I feel like I have to keep it plugged in at all times. It isn't usually the case, but if you forget to charge it periodically, you'll see yourself sitting next to the monitor, or plugging it in next to you.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />- Push-to-talk button to communicate back with baby.<br />- Rechargeable batteries.<br />- Nightlight on baby monitor.<br />- Volume adjustments on both devices (so you don't sound like your shouting at the baby when you try to talk to it).<br />- Power adapters<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />- Battery life doesn't seem to keep it's power long enough. Remember to plug in when possible to reduce chances of low battery device and requiring to plug it in.
B0092YYDPS|5|really nice music, very easy for my son to figure out how to turn it on.  Works great when he wakes up at night, he hits the button and goes right back to sleep.  The light isn't too bright and can easily attach to any crib because it has an adjustable strap.
B00LUK41AO|2|Size was smaller than I expected and the bottoms are not grippers, just slippery little dots.
B001WAJVZM|5|rhis fits almost any spout, is adjustable & protects little ones.  Plus, it looks cute & matches a bathroom scene
B0018CELO0|4|I bought this car seat after lots of research on what front facing car seats fit in Honda Civics. This one does, however it would be nearly impossible to put another car seat next to it as it is VERY wide. The strap to tighten is much harder than it was on our Chicco Infant seat, which we LOVED!    I gave it 4 stars because it is easy to get my very wigggly 14 month old in and out. And she seems to be very comfortable in it. Overall I am very statisfied, although I have only had it for 1 month.
B005KWL0OI|5|FANTASTIC product! My baby and I both love this product.  My baby enjoys sucking & gnawing on yummy treats and I enjoy being able to give him fresh foods to eat.  This product is easy to use and clean.  It is safe --no loose parts.  It is easy for little hands to hold.  It also has a loop on it to allow for attachment to a pacifier holder so you can clip it on baby.  It got this when my little one was 5.5 months, he is now 7 months and still enjoys it.  I have put all sorts of fruits in it to allow him to explore different flavors.  He is now starting to teeth, so I have been putting frozen or very cold pieces of fruit and he especially likes that.  Also have been starting to put pieces of chicken (when we're having it for dinner) in it to start getting him used to some meat.<br />This is a product that I recommend to other new parents and I just bought another one to give as a gift.
B007HS94KA|5|I bought this for a baby birthday and his room looks wonderful.  I hope to buy more for Christmas gifts.
B0006HBS1M|5|Works better than any electrical pump ever has and at a fraction of the cost.
B001O9F6M8|5|It really helped correct the flat head and stop further flatness.
B00J7KU3LA|5|Awesome product. Don't be a fool buy it.
B0000CBGBS|3|i received this for my shower and when my daughter was born i tried her in it. i found it held her head in a scrunched position with her chin to her chest. maybe when shes bigger it will be better but shes 2 months now and it still isnt working too well and soon she will grow out of it. good concept though just change the head position.
B00DIXQ2LC|1|DOES NOT stick to wall! These stickers would be cute if they stuck to the wall. Put up at night to surprise my daughter and woke up to find them in a pile most unusable. The ones I did salvage I reapplied only to find they keep peeling. I strongly recommend going with a quality name brand. I've had no issues with them not sticking!
B00G692FK2|5|Turns out perfect
B001AL7GOQ|5|I absolutely love this baby book! There are so many detailed, but easy pages for capturing those memories. Great quality! The only thing I don't like is that it has a page for immunizations, which I think is more of a personal preference than a &#34;keepsake memory&#34;. But other than that this is a perfect baby book.
B0011URFRE|5|We bought this to keep in my in-laws' car and it serves that purpose well. We use it for our preschooler. I don't think our little one would want to use this on a daily basis at his current size but in a few years it could be good for daily use.<br /><br />The fit and finish of the plastic and cloth are very nice. The few seat adjustments are also easy to make and installation was a breeze.
B006I1QTYQ|5|I like it!
B000CSEE3O|5|It makes a great booster seat.
B003KTLYGM|1|I had this item for two hours and it broke and with only a cell phone and keys in it. spoke to customer service about but I only wanted a refund after this sad two hour last time
B0057IQFKE|5|I bought this because a friend of mine had recommended them to me because she loved them, well so do I!!! The size is great from newborn all the way up to toddler! They absorb so much and clean up so well even with food that would normally stain. I have since bought them for another friend of mine that has had a baby.
B00M5OTDAM|5|My daughter LOVES this. Its so cute. And nicely made. It arrived very quickly. It was a hit at the baby shower.
B002SG7JSU|5|This product is really great on protecting my baby from injury and bruises that caused by hitting the table corners. They are made with soft and thick cushion and come in brown that matches my furniture finish. I thought the sticky tape would not be strong enough to hold them in place but I'm wrong. In fact, they stay put very well. Highly recommended!  A little installation trick to share here:  There are 4 short and 4 long tapes come in the package. Put the short square tape at one end and use the long one on the other side to make it a \\"L\\" shape.
B008K0TNQY|4|I bought it becasue I want to use it when I brought my girl out. it is the one which i saw from the internet. the figure is very nice and the material is soft. I haven't ask my girl use it just i am afraid if she doens't want to take off due to so much like in that.
B003XDB91U|3|Everything is fine except they aren't completely waterproof like our first set so things like spaghetti sauce go right through to the shirt and stain.
B004K0Z6F0|5|This is the best system ever. Why it isn't more common I'll never know. You get a breathable, soft bumper and a top water proof sheet that just pulls off. Extra top sheets are inexpensive and easy to find on Amazon or wherever. I used this up through overnight potty training at three and changing a sheet in the middle of the night took zero time or effort.  With extra sheets that are someasy to remove/replace you aren't forced to wash them right away if you don't have time right then.  I found mine at a TJ Maxx right before my daughter was born and had no idea at the time what a gift it would be!  Every new Mom should have this system!!
B000056OWC|3|I received this product as a baby shower gift.  My son was 9 lbs .5 ounce and 22 inches long when he was born.  I have been using this tub since his cord feel off at two weeks of age.  I wanted to convert it to a different stage tonight before I gave him a bath, but I could only find a sitting position which my son is not quite ready for. The 4 stage name is definitely deceiving because there are only 2 positions.  <br />As a newborn, I had a few problems with him slipping around but I just propped him up a little better and continued with the bath. I can only imagine the slipping problems if we didn't use a infant bathtub at all. We haven't had any problems with him scratching his feet on the bar because he pretty much lays there in enjoyment. But I could see this to be a problem if you have a little squirmer.  I did like the fact that this tub sits nicely across our tub from one side to the other side (soap dish area.)  This made it easy to reach my son when I was cleaning him.<br />The sitting position definitely looks to be very painful on the genitals.  I will try this position when my son is capable of sitting up erect.  However, I don't foresee it being comfy, safer, or easier than the good ol' house tub.<br />My son is now 4 months old and approximately 17lbs and 26 inches long. I will continue to use the reclining position until I see fit.  However due to the length of this body and the strength of his legs I don't think we will be able to continue using it for a long time.<br />I wouldn't recommend purchasing this product, however if you own this you can use it for awhile to get some of your money out of it.
B00GUN3Z1W|4|It's a pretty lightweight gate that seems like a determined baby (and definitely a child or dog) could break through, but it does hold in the doorway and so far has not marked up the door frame.  It's fairly inconvenient that you have to figure out in advance what notch to use in order to get it to actually latch in the doorway, then keep track of that notch as you lift the mechanism and try to align the whole thing in the door. It's so lightweight and flimsy that it moves around a lot while trying to keep it in the door, so this in itself is mildly frustrating. We marked the correct notch with a pen, and this simple fix makes it far easier to use.
B0040GJ0U6|5|My sons favorite toy - we bought two!
B00DB50ACO|5|Very nice combo! Easy to assemble
B00ADWNPMA|5|Daughter really loved this set.  Has held up well for over a year.
B006PB2EXO|4|Fast shipping. Was easy to set up until I had to lock it in place n it back difficult.
B0075M5H90|5|I love this cover. It's incredibly soft. It makes my baby fall asleep on the changing table!
B0011FV0EI|5|I bought 3 Hinkle rockers in dark green from my local \\" Just Cabinets \\" store. End of season sale at the store was $148.00/rocker which was much lower than the online advertised price of $179.00 less the 10% sale. I looked at rockers at Lowe's and read online reviews for Dixie rockers and Cracker Barrel rockers. All had some negatives mostly with the difficulty of assembly, cracked pieces of wood, cheap hardware, or uneven paint. All of these porch rockers including Hinkle are not fine furniture but you still want solid construction.  The Hinkle rockers are made out of ash although some of my slats looked like oak which is fine also. The rockers are heavy and came preassembled when picked up at \\" Just Cabinets \\". I bought the \\" Bradley \\" model which in the picture in this listing is the second from right. Paint quality is fine but with some missed places at a couple of joints. Maybe the wood shrank some after painting? I'm sure I will repaint at some future year so no big deal. No one cared last night when we were drinking bourbon and rocking. The rockers came with protective cardboard wrapping which left a sticky residue on the wood. I used methanol to remove the sticky with no adverse paint affect. I'm 6' and the back of my head rests against the top slat. Rockers ae more comfortable with a pillow for lumbar support. No staples in construction, just screws and brads. A solid porch rocker.
B000QACX40|4|It is built a lot better than some of the slightly cheaper other models by this brand.   In my opinion it needs a teething rail on the sides.    Shipping was slow but it came in tact.    Overall I would buy it again for the price.
B002A9IZ0Q|4|I bought this crib stateside and after receiving it, shipped it overseas as a gift. Packaging was still impeccable and all the parts intact. It was assembled and took no time at all. Following day had to be partly disassembled 'cos was assembled not in the room it would be used in, and was wider than door frame ... stood up OK.    Only cons are:  (a) No trudle drawer attached. The product description should be changed to remove all reference to a trudle drawer!!  (b) Looking to buy the conversion rails now (and send as gift to same party for later) - in case this model discontinued but I cannot find conversion kits anywhere for Stockcraft.     Otherwise a very good solid crib.
B00BHUV3GC|4|After I ordered this I read up on how walkers are banned in Canada and some say walkers are bad for learning to walk. I took the wheels off and let my LO just hang out in it. Doesn't take up much space and folds up great.
B003HC8604|4|After a lot of research, I ordered this seat and was very happy with my decision. Got it in the mail & loved it -- very sturdy, soft, stylish. I just realized today that it's too big (depth-wise) for my car (2000 Toyota 4Runner). It just doesn't fit. So, I would measure your back seat before purchasing this one if you have a car or smaller SUV. If size wasn't an issue then I would definitely keep this seat.
B006JV4HKS|5|I love this thing. First and probably most important, it comes apart completely and easily - I put the material in the wash machine and the plastic in the dishwasher and withing 2 hours it's pristine clean again. I clean it once a week (and believe me, it needs it). Second, if i ever need to travel with it, it folds up flat and easy to slide into a suitcase or a trunk. Third it comes in totally cute colors (we have the lime green). Lastly it has a handy pocket in the back for bibs, wipes, etc. In my estimation there are no down sides to this product!
B000066CMV|5|I used the Medela, and it works well. Nice to double pump - but what a pain in the long haul. This little pump was excellent. It was easy to travel with, store in diaper bag and use wherever I needed to use it. I discovered it after 6 months of nursing and using the Medela. Next time I will just use the Avent ISIS. Also, the company was excellent to work with. I had a problem with the pump, from my own fault. They shipped me the part overnight at their own expense. There were so kind and supportive of getting the part in my hands so I could continue to pump & nurse. <br /> <br />It is worth every penny!
B004769M70|5|I brought it for my colleague's baby, I have't give her yet. But it was good.
B003XDB91U|5|This is the best long-sleeved bib we've found. Unlike others we've tried, the end of the sleeve closes tightly around the wrists, which keeps food from going inside the sleeve, and the material doesn't end up smelling bad after a million washes. Perfect.
B00CFWFL1E|5|This was a baby shower gift, and it was well recieved! Everybody loved it!! Even the daddy to be gushed over it! It arrived on time, as stated. Very nice material and quick delivery!
B0052OTQZ4|3|personally I havent used them so cant speak to how they work but just wanted to add this review to let other know that they are priced much less at marshalls or tj max.same with all the dr brown feeding bowls.but none of them are microwave safe beware
B0000798KZ|5|We bought this gate several months ago for the top of our stairs and LOVE it! It's extremely secure, easy to use (even one-handed), and very stable. <br /> <br />Other gates we've tried have broken or come unmounted - causing them to be barriers to other rooms instead of gates, which has caused considerable inconvenience. We asked for two more of these gates for Christmas, and were excited to receive them, because we can start using the doorways in the first floor of our house again, instead of climbing over or going around to another route. <br /> <br />Excellent, excellent product.
B00H2CRNVI|3|Purchased the butterfly backpack for my daughter for Kindergarten.  She had the Owl for preschool and it was WONDERFUL!  Lasted 2.5 years and we still have it for playtime use.  Also purchased my son the lion when he started preschool.  The owl and lion held up great.  However, the zipper pulls on BOTH zipper on the butterfly backpack fell off within the first 2 months of school.  I never got around to contacting Amazon or Skip Hop - we tried several times to get the flowers back on but they never stayed.  I'm not sure how these are constructed differently than the owl and lion, but something isn't right.  We ended up just forcing a carabineer on each pull to replace the leather flower so that there was something to grip to close the zipper.
B004XWHBH6|1|I bought the blanket and a t-shirt from Belly Armor.  I tired the cellphone test many times and they all FAILED.  I think this product is a total scam trying to making money off expectant moms who will pay for the protection for their baby.  It is a very evil thing to do!  Don't waste your money on that!  An expectant mom.
B0060RW0AU|5|it is the best! so easy to use and even though it is pink you can see the food down to the very end. if you have a baby this is a must have !!
B00C2KW3II|1|If I rated this 2 weeks ago I would have given 5 stars. Last week we began to notice asymmetry in our 8 weeks old head.  We used this for her to nap and sleep at night and she began to only rest her head on one side. Because of this, she was originally diagnosed with torticollis. However, after evaluation, her neck muscles are just fine. The flat spot on her head was caused from the limit of range of motion from this sleeper. I do not recommend it and have not placed my baby in it since.
B00354WPYM|2|Poor quality very thin one of the worst breast bad I ever bought
B000AKB4IM|3|it does not look like how I thought
B0042D69WY|3|We purchased this swing because we needed another swing for the babysitter's house.  We already own the little lamb version of this swing and have had no problems, so purchasing this model seemed like a great idea.  Unfortunately the holes were drilled backwards so the swing could not be attached to the base.  I called Fisher Price and they were more than willing to send me a new part, but they didn't have the part.  They are sending a new swing, but it will take 6 weeks.  Six weeks is a long time to go without a swing!  Buy this swing, but be prepared to return it!
B005IWM7WE|5|It arrived on time. It's adorable and my granddaughter loves it. I might need another one for my house.
B00DBKFFJM|5|I struggled with the Medela PISA after returning to work at 2.5 weeks postpartum and then ordered the S1.....AMAZING. I am now 6 months postpartum and accredit my success at pumping to this pump, duckbill valves from nene supply, the pumping pal flanges, milkies breastfeeding supplements and I also use a basil & fennel essential oils blend that I made with young living oils (I rotate this one week on & one week off).<br /><br />The pump has not any loss of suction and I've used it until it's went dead before (only a couple times on long days), I've dropped it off my desk several times and it still just keeps right on going, the letdown feature is my favorite and sometimes I'll pump on that setting for the full 20 mins too because it works so well for my body. This doesn't come with a bag but that wasn't a big deal to me, I just throw it all in a 31 bag.<br /><br />I had bought 2 PISA, one for work and one for home. Needless to say one of the pumps I've only used once, after ordering this pump it was a difference between night and day. I hope it works for you!
B008FBEGQA|5|Love the Aden & Anais products and although it was a little pricey it was well worth it!!  My granddaughter loves it!
B006P05SHO|3|I really like the idea of this item with it's scoop and hang dry mechanism. I was a bit skeptical of the solitary suction cup and the reviews that coincide. I attempted multiple methods that I read that helps keep this clinging to smooth tiled walls. Not a chance. The longest it hung with a minimal amount of lightweight toys was about an hour and believe me the loud crashing into the tub was not appreciated with a napping toddler. The only thing that saved this product from a return is that my secondary choice of spots of the tempered glass shower door does hold and quite well. It's not ideal and does reduce the space a bit but I'm willing to overlook it. I think this product was on the right track design wise but it needs more suction cups and should be retooled for the future for me to recommend it to anyone.
B007NG5UF4|5|Good monitor with minimal interference. Volume was great too
B001UAEFLE|5|Beautiful rug, just perfect for my great-granddaughter nursery.  Good workmanship and -great price!  Just the right size for in front of crib.
B0037ST21A|5|When I got this toy my first thought was I should have been read its dimensions before buying it! It is smaller than other Haba similar toys. I did not return it only because I did not want to waste more money on shipping back. And I am very glad that I kept it. My baby LOVED this toy! It was her favorite among all dozen Haba baby toys we have. She was fascinated with this small ball. Moreover, I thought the size is bad but my girl had a different opinion. I am keeping this toy for my grandchildren :))<br />So, you never know what toy will be the best for your little one.
B000G80O4I|5|This is the best highchair ever!  I have owned a Peg Perego and a Fisher Price Healthy Care and they do not compare to the ease of use and fantastic look of this one.  Very easy to assemble and use.  I read that some people thought the tray was too small.  I totally disagee!  There is plenty of room for all the food a baby needs on a tray.  I love how easy it is to wipe down.  The best feature is the casters.  We have wood floors and this highchair just glides over them.  All of my friends who have seen it have fallen in love with the look and ease of use.  I highly recommend this product!!
B001W03A18|4|I haven't been able to use this yet because my baby isnt due for another 9 weeks, but the overall construction is good. The product looks good and works well. All of the pieces were included and the instructions were clear. The only thing I don't like is that the back wheels are not castor, they don't move any way but back and forth they don't swivel, this would have been nice. I would still definitely recommend this product.
B00295MQLU|5|Pros:<br />1. Easy to put together and adjustable to every shape and size.<br />2. I am a 38C at the end of pregnancy and the XS/S/M size fits perfectly.<br />3. There are multiple adjustable parts to the bra (velcro back panel allows you to adjust the ribcage band size by 10 inches, front zipper adjusts breast shields closer together or further apart by 2 inches, optional straps so you can wear as halter, tank or racerback style).<br />4. Holds Medela pumps securely and when bottles are full.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. May be visible through thinner tops so you may need to bring the bra with you, but it's so easy to slip on (if worn as racerback style) that I'm not inconvenienced by it.
B000056OV0|5|I got this tub based on the online reviews and have not been disappointed.  My daughter started using it as soon as as her cord fell off (1 1/2 weeks).  I from the very beginning have relied on the tub to hold her in place while I wash.  Not once has she slipped out of the positioner.  The design keeps her head out of the water.  She is 3 months and has really begun to experiment with splashing.  I think the hands-free design allows her more independence to explore her bathtime, without the fear of water in her face or frustration of being gripped all the time.  Another great thing is the tub is deep, so she stays warm , which means longer playtime.  The larger size is not that cumbersome, it still fits on the counter, although by using it in the tub I can bypass the rather slow draining tube and just dump it.
B0006HBS1M|5|Our newborn is exclusively breastfeed (still refusing to take a bottle...we're working on that still ;) ) but we still needed a pump for various reasons (relieve engorgement, store milk in freezer for future, etc).<br /><br />At first, as many of you I am sure have/are going through, pumping was uncomfortable for my wife. We highly, highly recommend going to a lactation consultant for tips. If you saw one at the hospital when you delivered, but their tips are still resulting in pain for you, SEE A DIFFERENT ONE! We went to a dedicated lactation consulting office and their methods were all almost completely different from what we were taught at the hospital! Thanks to the new lactation consultant my wife breast feeds now like a pro! Not saying the consultant at the hospital was bad --- just different methods work for different people.<br /><br />Two tips that really helped with the pumping aspect (comfort):<br />1) Medela makes different sized breast shields...the one supplied with the Harmony is their middle-of-the-road size. Try different sizes...it really makes a huge difference if the shield is not properly fitted to you.<br />2) Rub some nipple cream (we use MotherLove) on the inside of the shield before pumping.<br /><br />We use Evenflo glass bottles with this pump and they fit great. Pump directly into the bottle!<br /><br />I have found that the yellow valve (the one that the small soft white membrane goes on) can get stuck pretty easily when trying to take apart to wash. And sometimes when you are trying to twist it off it just makes it more stuck! After searching around on the internet i found a trick that really works to help get it off: push it forward with your thumb, almost as if you were popping a cap off a glass bottle with your thumb (but instead of pushing up, you push forward). It really saved me some frustration when i got the valve stuck.<br /><br />Amazon also sells extra valves and membranes, in case you want new ones. They also sell the different size shields.<br /><br />Conclusion - this pump is more than satisfactory AS LONG AS it is properly fitted and you are only using it for OCCASIONAL pumping. If you are returning to work and need to pump so your baby can bottle feed, please do yourself a favor and get a better model (electric). They are much more expensive but it will really be worth it for you in the long run!!!tisfactory AS LONG AS it is properly fitted and you are only using it for OCCASIONAL pumping.

B001XUIEFO|5|This Interlocking foam is fantastic. I am very happy with it
B00B507E7G|3|After reading reviews and doing some research, I initially decided to go with the Recaro Performance Sport.  However, I had quite a bit of trouble installing it in my car.  (I typically do not have any problems properly installing carseats).  I even took it to the local Fire Station and we still could not get a great fit and the seat still moved a little too much from side to side.  Even if the seat did fit properly, the seat belt was very tight and it pushed against the cushioning and ultimately my LO's back while she was sitting in the seat--this was because the belt path runs right behind the back cushions and there is nothing else to secure the belt in place.  This, for me, was unacceptable.  I decided to return it and try the Britax Frontier 90 that I had also considered.  The Britax was $50 more on Amazon, but was more than worth the higher price. The Britax has a steel frame and took all of 10 minutes to install with the ClickTight system and fits perfectly.  Amazon's customer service was great and was able to get me the new carseat the next day so I could promptly return the other.
B00BQGRXN4|1|This cup has frustrated me so badly!  The concept is great - really great, but this thing leaves puddles everywhere - in the diaper bag, car cup holder, dining room floor, all over the child... the top is SO EASILY knocked askew that the entire cup drains if it is ever not exactly upright.  The most frustrating part is, EVEN WHEN IT IS UPRIGHT, WATER PUSHES UP AND OUT THE STRAW continuously until the top is removed and refastened.  The company says this is the way to clean the straw, shake it up and natural water pressure is created so the water pushes up and out the top.  Well, any child is going to jostle the cup so this happens ALL THE TIME.  We are so frustrated with this product and I do NOT recommend it to anyone.
B004YN9RL2|2|[[VIDEOID:mo38DG4D08R0MJX]]I'm a father of two small children and needed a durable bag to accomodate the things they need.  I looked for bags that could handle sippy cups, bottles, formula, diapers, wipes, extra clothes, toys, coloring books, etc.<br /><br />I decided on the Grey-colored Okkatots bag and felt that it would meet my needs.<br /><br />The bag arrived today and I was struck by a few things:<br /><br />1) The exterior material is very durable (Great!)<br />2) There are indeed lots of pockets (Good!)<br />3) The workmanship is poor and quality control wasn't paying attention (Terrible!)<br />4) Customer service (which I called immediately) was non-existent (Awful!)<br /><br />My short video review shows three examples of the sub-par workmanship, particularly the stitching. I'm picky about these things because this bag was over $100 (at the time of purchase) and warrants better quality.<br /><br />I do not feel that the bag would last given the number of times I'd use it.<br /><br />I'm disappointed in the bag, will return it immediately, and will not recommend it to my friends.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Durable materials on the shell of the bag<br />Multiple pockets, including 2x outside cup pockets<br />Large, thermo-insulated pocket<br /><br />Cons:<br />The Customer Service phone number (1-888-988-6552 / 1-888-988-OKKA) was busy for hours at a time (I never got an answer)<br />Poor stitching in many places<br />Poor alignment of some pockets, including the one for the DVD Player<br />Single zipper openings (instead of double zippers for added convenience)
B000VB7D1C|4|This is a good clip for First Years pacifiers.  It clipped nicely onto his sleep sack and onto the pacifier.  My son's daycare used it a lot when he was 3-6 months old since he always threw his pacifier on the ground.  Pacifier clips always make me nervous so always keep an eye on your child when he's using this.
B0007SMK76|5|I purchased this for my 4mo old son and he has loved it from the first day.  I havn't experienced any paint peeling problems, and he chew on everything.  I looked at several others and none of them compared to the value and substance that this one offers.  Great product!
B007NG5UF4|5|We have several of these monitors. we have 3 kids. we love the long battery life and also the fact that it is not recording every small sound from the room. you can set it to just pick up medium to loud sounds. we had other monitors that would keep us up a night because they were to sensitive.
B007NG5UF4|3|Does the job but sometimes can have static or blips of noise that make me think it's the baby stirring. I am now used to this happening but at first it made me think it was a nice by the baby
B004WOZMQ2|4|My daughter loves it.  She can't get over the stars.  I just wish it has music with it.
B008J1QP7Y|5|ok
B000S9RF4M|5|My son has used this from the time he was around 8 weeks old and he still loves playing with it at 6 months old.  We use it on the Baby Bjorn Babysitter, and it keeps him entertained for a while.  He constantly has the butterfly in his mouth and ripped the seams open.  Tiny Love sent us a new play arch to replace the broken the butterfly.  Great product and great company!
B00KDJ4YXM|5|Really good quality, on time delivery and fair price
B0009JOSNM|5|thank you
B002HGQVS0|4|I just had to write a review on this product! I think it's an ingenious idea and I'm so glad I found it in my search for crib sheets. The &#34;set&#34; comes with the bottom portion and the top sheet. The two zip together and completely encase the crib mattress. The top sheet zippers off and on easily for midnight sheet changes. The bottom is basically put on just like a fitted sheet only on the underside of the mattress.<br /><br />After six months of use I can point out a few things I do and don't like about the sheets but overall I would buy them again and recommend them to any new mom. First I love that they are 100% cotton and hate that at the same time. I love it because it's known to be the safest fabric to use for your baby due to it's breathability. I hate it because anything that is 100% cotton will be wrinkly even strait from the dryer. The edges of this top sheet have the heavy duty, easy to use zipper that is covered by about and inch of fabric that extends past the zipper so baby isn't sleeping on the plastic zipper. This area around the edge may take some getting used to if you are thinking of the usual fitted sheet smoothness. May I just say that this lip around the edge of your baby's sleeping surface isn't necessarily a bad thing. It seems completely safe and when you have a baby in the crib that can not have anything to sleep with like a blanket or lovey until one year, this little one-inch piece of fabric around the edge has become somewhat of a soother for my daughter. She sometimes plays with it until she falls asleep. Back to the 100% cotton issue I mentioned earlier, these sheets MUST be ironed. That piece of fabric that overlays the zipper becomes very wrinkled and folds up exposing the zipper. Even with the need to iron these sheets I would still choose them again. I would rather iron when I have the time than pull up the crib mattress to change regular crib sheets in the middle of the night. One other problem I noticed with these is they do fit our crib mattress pretty snug but over time they do stretch a bit leaving a ripple on her mattress which worries me. I removed and washed the bottom sheet and it seems to have tightened back up but I would suggest the manufacturer add extra elastic to the bottom sheet to make certain they consistently remain snug.<br /><br />Like I mentioned earlier, I love these sheets and this idea in general. If you are lucky enough to come across these sheets please consider buying them. I bought two extra top sheets to go along with this set so I would always have extra top sheets on hand.o fit our crib mattress pretty snug but over time they do stretch a bit leaving a ripple on her mattress which worries me.

B0038OLMXE|5|We have been looking for a gate that we could install via pressure mount, but was also sturdy and solid.  This gate fit those requirements perfectly - would highly recommend this gate!  We purchased two of them and they are working great for our needs, our chocolate lab!
B00JYDF6EE|1|It came very smashed to the point it wasn't even the right shape. The bed was a VERY thin oval not at all like the picture and it was impossible to reshape. We returned it.
B000YDDF6O|5|Why does my kid love this toy, I have no idea, but it's saved me many of car rides and plane trips. This plastic 8 dollar toy is our go-to for whenever she goes a wall and it ALWAYS works. It's weird, plastic, and kind of ugly but a life saver. Get it. I never write reviews but this toy is worth it.
B0042D69WY|5|I was given the Graco 2 in 1 swing and my daughter just didn't seem to like it.  Out of desperation I bought this - my daughter loves it!  Highly recommend!
B00M1QM8BK|5|Love all the swaddle blankets by summer infant. My baby slept well at night with them and added some safe warmth. Will be giving them as gifts for friends that are expecting.
B00WFBNYYQ|5|Definitely helping my 5 month old sleep better!
B004UOPUM0|5|I researched umbrella strollers for weeks and I am so happy that I ended up with this one. It is so easy to close, the sun shade is amazing, and the one handed recline makes juggling everything so easy. I have the full size uppabay vista stroller which I do love, but I needed something smaller to travel with. Flying in the plane then fitting the uppa in a rental car with all the luggage is just too much.
B002U3ZSBG|5|Bought this to go with an eddie baur travel system it works great just moving the car seat and not the base.
B006ZL22PY|5|Awesome, beautiful, perfect for slightly wet grass at picnics, large enough to comfortably seat a family, super happy with this purchase!
B00GQQVNO4|3|Okay so for the price, these are cute, fun leggings that I plan to wear around the winter holidays, for fun. But I have to say, the patterns doesnt match up on each side, and that bothers me a little. Actually a lot. But again, I wasnt intending on these being a serious fashion purchase, just more of something to wear lounging or to casual dinners.
B004G45EGG|5|I was sad to see this is harder to get a hold of than when I bought it two years ago. This got alot of use from both of my daughters, now aged 2 and 1. Great for restaurant high chairs when they aren't quite ready to sit on their own yet. Also great for shopping carts, and those round park baby swings. We just passed it along to a friend and it is still in great condition!!
B008PPQ2KY|3|It is cute and the price was good. I thought it was bigger than it is. I should've measured but it will do.
B004I0775O|5|I did not want a bunch of strollers, just one, whether is for walks in the park, for airplane rides or for crowded parks or supermarkets. This one is very, very comfortable, very, very light, easy to fold, has great canopy, stands by itself. I find it so easy to fold it and put it in the trunk (I drive a small car). I carried it all over Europe, and works great for all day trips, since it fully extends to almost a bed like position. I highly recommend this stroller!!!
B0006HBRY0|3|I bought this seat for it's rave reviews and safety rating.  I am confortable knowing my child is in the safest seat out there. I purchased two of these seats (an extra one for grandma's car) and received a reduced rate and free shipping for having bought two and taking the cowmoofladge pattern, which may not sell as well as others but is more attactive in person than the picture does it justice.  I bought an onyx for myself, but now wish the cow pattern was mine, lol!    HOWEVER, my baby is five months old and about 20-lbs at this point.  The reviews I read said that the seat \\"reclines\\" which was important to me.  I want my baby to have the best of everything, to be comfy as can be and to be SAFE.  But this seat has a minimal recline to it, and is no where near the amount of \\"recline-ability\\" that the infant seat I'd been using up to the point of getting this product.  So his little head hangs in front of him when he falls asleep and he looks terribly uncomfortable.  He cries sometimes when I put him into it and usually every time getting him out (if I don't get him out fast enuf).  The seat is LARGE and obstructs my view out the rear passenger window.  I can no longer see him the mirror on the head rest he faces, which I'd used before with his other seat in orfer see him from my rear-view mirror.  Also, I no longer have the option of putting his smaller car seat into/on to the shopping cart when I go to the store--something to think about moms.    In time, my baby will grow and hopefully this seat will be a better product for him down the line.  However, as things are now, I would not have taken him out of the seat he was in before this one, until later.  And I might have reconsidered another model also, as far as being able to see out my window and using the mirror that I had back there to view him from.    I spent alot of money to end up having such mixed feelings.    :(
B005LVZJUO|4|my 5 months old baby girl loves him. she loves to pull leg and chew everything. somehow the metarial attract dust so much so the monkeys body is always filthy. It would be great if I could put him in the washing machine.
B00F2MQ258|5|Great product especially if you have prime.  Keeps my niece busy and she gets a (or a couple hundred) kick(s) out of it!
B005VMJO7C|5|Prevents me from rolling flat on my back while sleeping.  Very useful haven't cleaned it yet so I can't comment on that.
B000X084ZU|5|I was looking for a step stool that looks more like a piece of furniture and less like a plastic kid toy (we have enough of these).  This stool looks great!  Plus, my daughter loves being able to climb it and reach the sink herself.  Even though you have to put it together yourself, it's very sturdy once assembled.  We'll probably buy another one for the upstairs bathroom.
B001FW3UHW|5|My son has used his \\"binky bear\\" and \\"binky monkey\\" now for a year and a half...they're his everything!! His sister has a 'blanket' she has carried around her whole life...and my son has his binky animals :) They're his \\"statement\\" piece...everyone loves seeing it hanging from his binky :) It saved us when he was younger...his binkys would constantly fall out of his crib (between the slats) and these animals stopped that from happening...plus...he could feel around and find them himself :) Score!! More sleep for us all! HIGHLY recommend!!!
B0018OHCLC|5|Very good starter spoons, but not good for thin baby food because it will spill out.  Great for oatmeal.
B000LZDUJ2|2|Cheaply priced but cheaply made as well. I bought two sets for our vehicles and 3 out of the 4 didn't make it the first two weeks w/out getting damaged. The edges curl out, they don't fit well, they're flimsy and they seem to rip out of the stitching...and when they do this your vehicle interior starts to look cheap and ratty. My suggestion, spend the extra 8 bucks for these heavy duty ones: Brica Deluxe Kick Mats, 2 Count. I've had these for two months now and ZERO issues whatsoever.
B006CFCNDO|4|This is an amazing monitor.  I can be anywhere in the house, and still be able to hear if my baby is stirring.
B001MTELJO|1|99% of toilet bodies are curved, this item has 2 suction cups, which would work great, if it weren't for the fact that both suction cups are equally alligned. Not sure how they tested this item when going through the bother of building it, but they obviously didn't test it on a toilet or a 7 month old baby who ripped it off the toilet the only time I was able to adhere both cups!
B00BH365LM|5|LIKE
B002F9MUX4|3|I bought this product because of what it is \\"free\\" of. The only thing I do not like is that you cannot separate the top from the base to clean the inside. Over time it will get rather gross because there is no way to clean it or fully dry it. I find it very hard to believe that the little hole will allow enough water in to dry it out.
B00PBAU80Q|4|I like this drinkable vitamin. It has all the postnatal vitamins I need, especially for breastfeeding. I can tell a difference in my energy level when I don't take it. I can only award it with 4 stars because it doesn't taste the best. To help with this, I mix it in with orange juice or apple juice. It's especially bearable in apple juice- the combo of orange with apple flavor is actually pretty good. Also, drinking it with a straw helps too.
B00004D3EU|4|I haven't had problems with this tub.... I used another tub for my son for the first 3 months, and that tub became too small, so I purchased this one.  I'm so glad I did.<BR>At 3 months, my son was large for his age, but unable to sit up yet, so this tub was perfect.<BR>I've given it 4 stars instead of 5 because I agree with the other comments that it is not easily collapsible to store, and it is bulky, but we simply let it dry in the bathroom overnight and store it under his crib during the day - so space turned out to not be so much of a problem.<BR>I have had no issues with the tub leaking though.  Once it is completely extended, there is a good seal and it does not leak.<BR>I have and will continue to recommend this tub to all my friends.<BR>It's accomodating for longer than any tub out there.<BR>well worth the money.
B00NBB1XTM|2|Not very thick!  Would not purchase again.  Not Terry Cloth like the wash rags are.
B0036VLE1Y|2|Got these as a gift and they are really cute, and I like that they are shiny. I'm disappointed that after washing them carefully a few times, the paint is falling off into the inside of the bib(hard to explain). So it's starting to look like a clear bib in random patches. I gently washed in cold water and ALWAYS hang to dry. They were cute while they lasted, but certainly not worth the money. It's so hard to find a great bib :(
B000056HNM|5|Im really surprised that there are many people complaining about not being sturdy.  I run a licensed group daycare home (12 kids) and this thing has been great!  You should see all the stuff we have on it, in the middle shelf we have 6 infant spaces with diapers stacked near the front and the spare clothes for each of these kids behind it.  The bottom shelf has the same but only one or two kids and the rest of the space is all used for spare clothes for the kids.  We also have some pretty big kids using it, the 2 1/2 year olds get changed there every single day and the screws never needed to be tightened.  Like I said, we have a daycare, we change 4 infants and 4 toddlers every weekday here and never a problem. <br />Anyway, I will definately be purchasing one for my little baby due in May with all the confidence in the world.  I don't condone all the Jenny Lind products though, the crib is great too especially for the money but the cradle didnt last long at all.  I did have a BIG problem with that one comming loose all the time and tipping.<br />Trisha
B008VWHJ5S|5|Grandson loves this potty seat.  He is in training.
B00M6N5Z86|5|Great! Easy to clean and my daughter loves it. It's not neat by any means, but she seems to really enjoy using it.
B0013NFZNU|5|This product is great.  I couldn't find this type of nipple at the local stores.  The only thing that was disappointing was that the first time I purchased the nipples they were $2.99 for 2 nipples and the following week when I ordered more, they were $3.02 for 2 nipples.  Not a  huge difference in price, but there was a price increase that I didn't expect.
B007CTPWXW|5|Love it! I have a Graco stroller frame for our car seat and this fits perfectly! So glad I bought this organizer.
B001PB8G04|5|This was adorable and my new niece loved it.
B002DWAGAC|5|I bought this to use with my Graco Pack n Play. To clear things up, it buckles the mattress when its not in the Pack n Play (as noted by many reviews) HOWEVER, once you place the mat into the Pack n Play, it lays flat and there's no problem with buckling. It looks great and definitely adds a little softness to the mattress.
B00PYU2GAS|5|I love the prints! Very cute.
B00H3X80VS|2|Mine came with a puncture in the tablet holder (the plastic part) it's noticeable enough that it's annoying. If you have the ipad air it fits but you'll have to take your apple case off, and that's just too much of a hassle for me.<br /><br />The wipes container is useless. It doesn't fit my wipes properly, it needs to be a little wider, and really why is it in there? I can just throw a bag of wipes in there. There's not enough slots in here, the bottom is just one big open space and so it's not the kind of organization I like. What's the point of shoving everything in 1 spot, my diaper bag is more organized than this. This needs serious improvements for me to consider purchasing or recommending
B00BORYGNU|5|This was exactly what we were hoping for!
B00839749A|4|Used them when my daughter was between diaper sizes.  One size was too small but the bigger size resulted in some leaks.
B007RF987C|5|Just seeing people's reactions--smiling, giggling, nudging each other--make it so worth it.  They are a true conversation piece. My 7 month old daughter absolutley LOVES her babiators. I think she knows how cute everyone thinks she is in them too. They must be comfortable because she never has tried to take them off. If anything, she is really happy when I put them on her. Since getting them she has worn them every time we go outside and now she can actually see and not have to squint in the bright sun. I love the idea of 100% UVA/UVB protection and that Babiators will replace them if lost or broken in the first year. I plan to buy these as gifts for all my girlfriends' baby showers in the future!
B00B7XUVLW|5|This bag is precious and I love that you can wipe the material down (feels like a weird hardish plastic) but it looks cloth. It's not too big and not too small.  Update: I have had this bag for almost a year with two kids, and it still looks brand new. My only complaint is that it leans forward when sat down, but that's not really too big of a deal.  It's been the perfect size for a baby and toddler. Now, with another baby on the way, I look forward to seeing if it can hold all of the contents that I need it to with a newborn, 11 month old, and a 2.5 year old. (2 in diapers, snacks, bottles, sippy cups, etc.)
B00IP8AB1C|5|I absolutely LOVE this seat! It rear faces to 40lbs & 40in, I'll be able to keep my daughter rear facing til she's like 4 at least! I bought mine at Walmart, I have the pink and black one! And if I have anymore children, I am going to skip the infant bucket seat and just go straight to a convertible.
B00OE8GXWI|1|It was the wrong duck. Waiting for return instructions.
B004I8VLGC|5|There were no problems with this order - it came in time and as expected- the teether is one of my grandson's favorite toys.
B00FNIZQ6W|1|They're not easy to clean (I've handwashed) and they are impossible to get dry, which makes me nervous about mildew/mold forming. The zipper is on the bottom, which makes them unable to stand up like a &#34;throw away&#34; food pouch.  I wanted to really love this, but can't. The fill line on the side is NOT ACCURATE. I've filled to BELOW that line and it STILL squeezes out the bottom when I try to zipper it closed.
B006INOMFM|4|I bought these because my husband can't melt them in the dishwasher like the other brand I purchased.  They were great for feeding my little one.  The problem is that as she gets older and wants to try to feed herself these are really hard for her to hold because of the tiny handle.  As she starts feeding herself more and more we will have to switch to something else but I really liked these until recently.
B000USV8JO|4|I purchased these to try to cover up granite corners b/c I could not find any other solution. They are working great except that they are a little short of covering the thickness of the counter. I would imagine they'd be perfect for glass.
B0038JDD36|2|These are super cute and extremely soft, but the bigger she gets, 6 months now, the bear heads interfere with her pacifier and just her cheeks and and mouth area in general.  We wish we had gotten just the plain strap covers.
B0096MLKFW|5|Our little boy seems to always know when he doesn't have a diaper to urinate. These changing pads keep our pack and play dry and clean.
B0057L8UOU|5|Great item for the price. I had purchased a mobile you had to wind. The best reason I love this mobile is you can attach it to the stroller, car seat, portable crib and swing. The only downside to this product is the music is really low, sound could have been just a little bit louder...
B008OJ7C6Y|5|This is wonderful. I like that no matter where baby is sleeping it can be used! I finally am sleeping with less worry! Easy to use.
B001I7TCQC|4|We got this stroller because it's built well for tall parents (hubby is 6'7\\" and can comfortably push it).  I have put many a mile on it.  Two babies in two years and baby boot camp.  Lots of miles.  Love the bassinet feature, used it as a mobile bassinet when they were newborns.  Love the bug covers, the rear facing, ease of changing the recline,the never flat tires & folding.  The only drawbacks are these:  expensive, the rear wheels stick out pretty wide and you will be running into things.  Occasionally the brake would catch on me, not fun during a brisk walk.  Rare event tho.  Super cute & always get lots of inquiries about it.  I live in a rural area now so I probably won't get much on resale for it, but in a larger metro area I'm sure you could sell it for a decent price.  It still looks very new even after all the miles and I am very happy with it.  Eco-concious company.
B00024JSF2|2|Followed the directions that came with it, but it does not stick to the tub very well.
B00CXH2M2W|2|Didn't't fit diaper genie 2 as well as the playtex did.
B0067GKHVS|5|AWESOME.  Ignore price.  Buy thing.  Profit.<br /><br />Pulls one wipe at a time.<br /><br />Great materials.<br /><br />Even a sleep-deprived parent can operate.
B006WR01UE|5|Best cloth diaper cover. Fits great and holds everything in.
B007FRJQ5G|5|Excellent. The little ones sleep great.
B004U8X9T2|3|This item is quite expensive for what you get. Looks cheap. Although soft. My child wasnt interested. I wouldnt recommend it,
B00295MQLU|5|I was skeptical at first but when I figured out how to position the openings for the flanges, I was literally and figuratively hooked. I was already getting some neck and upper back strain associated with pumping. With this bra/bustier, you are truly hands free. If you would need to massage your breasts to help with the expression you would have to insert your hands beneath the bra, but since you are not doing a balancing act with the contralateral breast its actually okay.
B001R8YYOC|5|I got this toy for my baby when he was 6 months old.  He is now 11 months and still loves it.  At first he just held on to it and looked at it.  Now he waives it around, moves it from hand to hand, pulls on it, shakes it, and drags it around with him everywhere.  It also doubles as a teether and he loves to chew on the cars and has learned to manipulate it to reach the back teeth to relieve some teething pain there.    The toy is adorable and is possible to easily attach to his carseat or stroller with a toy holder so that it won't get lost.  It is great quality and so far withstood months of constant play and teething action.  It is also safe as it is painted with non-toxic paint and made in Germany (and not in China - like most toys out there).
B001D458HC|5|I have ordered quite a few of these from amazon. I live in the Midwest and winters are very cold and snowy. I like to use the fleece sleepsack swaddles because they keep my baby at just the right temperature during the night with our thermostat kept at 68 degrees. I just put her in a shortsleeve onesie and swaddle her up. If I don't swaddle my baby her startle reflex will wake her every 10 minutes. I recommend these to any new or experienced parent, especially if you live in colder climates. It really helps baby sleep comfortably and safely those first few months.
B003ZYE7FC|3|My 8 month old was having a hard time with traditional sippy cups so I decided to give these a whirl. She was able to get a sip of water on the first try! They are very easy for her little hands to hold and although she has to concentrate while sucking (it's really cute) she seems to enjoy it. They do leak though... I always make sure to push the straws/valve together and make sure it is clicked but they still seem to leak a little but no where near some of the others we have tried (tommy tippe being the worst). Overall a good cup!
B000E8S9WO|5|These are great party favors. While not the best quality in the world, they have great details and for the price, you can't beat it.
B0077F9WAA|5|These swaddle blankets are awesome! My husband and I would swaddle our baby with a regular swaddle blanket and my baby was always able to wiggle her hands out and then startle herself awake.  It was so frustrating for her and for us.  My friend had a photo of her baby wrapped in one of these so I decided to try them.  They are amazing! My baby could not wiggle herself out and was very comfortable.  She started sleeping &#34;through the night&#34;, 6-7 hours, as soon as we started using these.  I highly recommend these to parents with a newborn.
B004DC9TD0|5|Most of the reviews have already hit on the main issues that make this Duallie stroller great!  I can attest to the new design being FAR superior to the last generation single BOB my wife and I bought a year or so ago... Where BOB made the improvements are as follows 1- accessory attach / detach - old model required screw driver and several minutes of connect / disconnect, now its a couple quick moves and done - All accessories go in the same ports.  2- Fabric used for seats, foot rest, and canopies are a much richer / substantial feel, plus the materials used for the under the seat storage is reinforced and has a load floor so it doesn't sag. 3- There have been several improvements to the tools to keep the stroller locked when folded snap vs. velcro (our single refused to remain closed on a recent flight when ramp workers were trying to load under the plane.  Overall, we're very happy we spent a little extra money on a new BOB vs. looking for a used duallie.  I think you will be too.
B006WLDLOS|4|I buy it for my daughter, she like it
B000L9JNTE|5|my 18 month daughter cannot live without her bunny... she got it at six months old and it has been at her side ever since. it is the perfect size and does not get in the way and can easily we stuffed in a diaper bag, purse or even a big pocket We are ordering extras so we have another in emergencies.
B0090NKA2Q|5|I bought these for a friend.  Her baby was having trouble nursing from a nipple to a bottle.  This nipple was the one she took right away.  So glad we found them to help out.
B000YDDF6O|5|I ordered this for my son's God daughter. She was 6 months old. She loved it! My daughter asked me to get one for her Godson and I was happy to. He loved it too! They are so proud of being able to play the music themselves. They were both teething and they could use it for that too!! LOL
B002VK2I1G|5|Love this bag!
B002OI4L74|1|This product was relatively easy to put together (took one person about two hours) and looks good with the Piedmont crib. It's small, but fits nicely in my son's room.<br /><br />Despite the positives, I would not recommend this product. It arrived with multiple scratches. As I was putting it together, I noticed that the wood scratched at the slightest touch. I literally could put a scratch in it by lightly running my fingernail over it. There are already scratches on the front just from putting the drawers in. You can imagine what my child will be able to do to it when he gets a little bit older. I had to put the chest in a different part of the room just so that the most scratched part (the right side panel) wouldn't be in view.<br /><br />This product is definitely not worth it. Find something else with higher quality materials.
B00B9ZHQ5W|5|OMG. Why didn't I have these with my daughter years ago? I make my own baby food, I use the Infantino pouches and filling station to get meals ready for anytime we're not at home. Holy cow do these things make my life better. At dinner? Well, pull out a pouch and pop the spoon on and feed him. Easy as that. Done in 1-2-3. They actually work like they're supposed to and take up less room and less cleaning than you'd think. I just leave them in the diaper bag all the time.
B000FGFX8I|5|Super happy with my purchase
B00Q8EOLL6|5|It looks great in the bedroom.
B00DAIMDQ8|5|I received a FunBites food cutter in exchange for my honest opinion.<br /><br />The FunBites food cutters are fun, fast way to cut up food for little ones into uniform, small bites.  You can use these on bread, cheese, meat, pancakes, fruit - the list is endless!  I have used the cutters to create quick and fun lunches for my kids and they love it!  Their friends at daycare are interested to see each day what sort of shape will be built into their lunchboxes with their sandwiches or cheese.  They think it is a fun game to come up with different \\"scenes\\" with their food and then to eat them after.  I love that my girls are eating more because their food is fun AND they are learning about building bigger shapes/objects out of smaller ones.  Plus we can talk about different shapes with them!  What a win-win for us as parents!
B004K6LNO2|5|These bibs do a great job of covering more clothing area than a standard bib. They are also more of a cloth material (while still being somewhat water resistant) so it is easy to put them in the clothes washer once a week to get them extra clean.
B0088UXLSW|4|Great for the girls!!
B00005BSXI|1|This item was bought off my baby registry in April of 2007. We did not start using it until August as my son stayed in the room with us until that time. From August to April of 2008 it worked fine. I was leary about getting a safety 1st monitor becuase I had one with my daughter 5 years ago and it just stopped working. But because Dorel was so good about replacing the unit, I decided to go with them again. Well BIG MISTAKE! The power cord on the tv stopped working. I contacted them SIMPLY to PURCHASE a new cord. They told me that model was discontinued and they only had the adaptor for the audio monitor and the camera. I told them that I wanted the unit replaced. It was not my fault that they were not making it anymore. I mean Amazon is selling it. I found it at walmart as well. How can these companies sell something that is no longer being made? After 2 weeks of emailing back and forth, they wanted proof of purchase which I no longer had. It not only was a gift but it was a year ago! They refused to replace this $200 video system. I called them and was told what that they couldn't do anything becuase there was no proof of when I bought it and the manufacture date was Jan of 2007...also a year beyond their alloted time. After requesting to speak to a supervisor, the girl told me she was authorized to sell me the system for $50. I figured that was the best they were going to do so I took it however I am furious over having to pay anything at all when all I wanted was a power cord. It must be a problem with this model since they had no power cords left but had plenty to the other two pieces of this unit    I will say that I loved this monitor. It is clear and crisp...not sound interference. But the customer service dept of Dorel and the fact that this is the second monitor I got burned on by this company, makes it just not worth it
B000E0IIT6|5|Well Worth it. My niece enjoyed this chair.
B00ISS2JPK|2|The bottom is not padded enough and doesn't seem comfortable for the kids cause it's a straight 90degree back. I sent it back they really need to make the seat more padded.
B001A4DOB2|2|I saw this diaper bag in a store and fell in love with it, but when I received it as a gift I realized it was too small to be practical.  Also, the zipper on the changing pad part was broken (the fabric was caught in the zipper).  I'll be returning this for a bigger diaper bag.
B004V903RG|5|love these bags as they are super affordable compared to others. they seem durable and i like that they hold 6oz (i usually put a little more than that in there) compared to other bags that hold 5oz. i haven't thawed out alot of these bags yet (only a few) to comment on how they hold up with freezing. the few that i've thawed did not leak but will have to see later when i start to thaw more.
B00KGLJ1RG|5|great! way better than what you can find at buybuybaby and walmart/target
B000BUORPI|5|This has come in very handy. Even though I have a little girl we use this in her closet and it definatly helps hold all her shoes and other little items we dont have a place for.
B003CK3LDI|5|We were given these by our birthing hospital for our twins.  They have been with us from day one and will continue to be so until our children are weaned from them.  They provide the perfect combination of a pacifier and a toy.  It gives our babies something to hold on to and concentrate on while going down to sleep.  We love these guys and have given many of these as gifts over the past year or so.  I haven't had the first complaint from any recipients.  Clean-up is easy.... throw them in the washer and wash with hot water.  it's as easy as that.
B00K7541IK|5|Beautiful! Thank you!
B007P58O5G|5|thanks, everything is good!
B009YDCH2S|5|wonderful, my grandson loves it!!
B00EU5AL8W|3|really like the picture and sound quality however when not plugged in it only holds a charge for an hour or two. Battery almost instantly drains... I have it plugged in all night on bed stand but the battery life can be problematic for long naps
B000VS8WGA|5|This monitor is wonderful!  My husband and I bought this after reading the great reviews about it and we haven't been disappointed.  The alarm has gone off a few times, usually because our son moves to the corner of his crib and sleeps with his bottom in the air and I think the monitor has trouble detecting his breathing with him laying like that and so far away.  It does take a couple of times with the alarm going off to train yourself to turn off the monitor before picking up baby.  All in all, very satisfied.  Have already recommended this to several friends.
B00PSTIUEQ|5|This feeding set is the best thing for any parent who is ready for the next phase in feeding their babies. This bowl having the suction ensures the baby does not dump the food all over the place, the bowl has been put to the test and I have to say my baby cannot lift that bowl and makes it a little easier to control the mess. The suction is very easy to remove and the bowl is large enough. I have tried other bowls but the size was always too small and would need to get seconds for my baby. I also love how the spoon and fork has a heat detection so I do not have to worry if the food is too hot. The handle of the fork and spoon is large enough for my baby to grasp and learn to feed himself. This set is perfect and highly recommend parents to get your baby a set, makes it easier to teach your baby to eat with some peace of mind.
B00433OQO6|4|We tried 4 different bottle brands, and this is the one we settled on as the best. Considering how bad the other ones were, though, it's not really saying much. Each bottle have FIVE different pieces you have to clean separately (bottle, nipple, O ring, outer ring, and cap) and it just gets to be a huge pain. The O ring also leaks frequently no matter how tightly you put it on and it spills all over the baby. They also leak out of the nipple when the cap is on because the only thing keeping the milk in is the fact that the holes are supposed to be pressed up against the flat top of the cap. The problem with this is that you have to put the cap on extremely carefully and put it on *exactly* straight down to prevent the nipple from bending over and letting milk leak. Even doing all that doesn't always prevent leaking, though. That being said, these are all problems we've run into with other bottle brands, so it's kind of a matter of choosing the best of the worst. I gave it 4 out of 5 stars because of that.
B001I8FKLW|5|This is the best teether I have ever found. It is easy for my daughter to hold and isn't too big for her mouth. It really soothes her when her teeth are bothering her.
B004044LD4|4|Great mattress!
B000G0L2TM|3|This is a quality product, it just didn't work well for our son. There was too much fabric and the swaddles that used velcro ended up being a much easier option for us.
B005WH3R9M|5|Worth the money!  My son is in his 3 year old &#34;destroy and destruct&#34; stage.  This car seat has held up beautifully!  Very happy with this purchase.
B0042QP5QC|5|excellent
B0000798KZ|5|We have had two of these gates (one at the bottom and one at the top of the stairs) for almost two years without any problems.   Very easy to install.  No knobs have broken.  It was difficult for my oldest to open at first - he was 3yrs when we installed them for our youngest.  It took almost a year for him to be able to open it by himself, which was just fine with me.  I took them down about two weeks ago - we're getting ready to sell them in our yard sale.
B006ZVV0NO|5|I use these for my little dog when I travel. They are great because you can move them around quite easily. I even steel one now and then to put one on my window for the sun. They stick on the window perfect and come off with ease. Don't have a problem with them not sticking. Shields my dog from the sun, works perfect to keep him cool. !!!
B000LZDUJ2|2|These don't cover the entire back of the seat of my Lincoln aviator!
B008GVXGY2|4|arrived damaged, but not unfixable. The B had come off it's post. My daughter really liked having all the messages written to her at her birthday party.
B002UGMP3C|4|So far so good.  I would recommend it.  My only problem was I purchased as new and it came as used.  Already put together, which was nice, but box had the other person's mailing label on flap of box.  Was a little put off by that.  Should have been charged for used one.
B00OIX7XYQ|5|Great bag. Fits a lot. A little on the bigger size for my liking but I'm keeping it because it's a great bag.
B00GX65WZI|5|Purchased a box of these 8 plus years ago for the first batch of grand kids then again when my younger son had his child.  They are great and work just fine for all my sharp edged furniture.  Really gives me peace of mind.  Had no problem installing all over the house.
B00EU7D0NI|4|great for the price. center nubs can hurt a bit.
B00BEVSRTA|5|I love these bottles for age 8 months and over. They do leak but they are great for older babies... Just have to watch them cause the nipple does leak if left upside down. Baby loves them... Good transition before sippy.
B004ECJWK4|3|it dont fit on the door i really neede it to...but good for othere doors in the house
B001FWY1H0|4|My daughter really enjoys this, she loves for me to hold her hands and let her bounce away.   She no longer likes  jumpers, so this seems to have filled the need to bounce!  And it's super cute.
B00NJ0U0OO|5|Super cute baby book! Would definitely recommend for a new mommy! Great quality and fun pages.
B001H0GEXO|5|The instructions and putting it together was a little confusing and frustrating but once I got everything together, I loved it! It is very comfortable and the colors matches her stroller and diaper bag.
B000I6KY70|5|We got this as a spare sheet to go with the other Tiddliwinks Jungle bedding.  It is very cute.  My son loves to look at the animals and point to them.  It keeps him entertained in bed!!
B00BNQEZXS|5|I love this base.  It enables the car seat to be latched in a second.  I couldn't recommend this more.
B0000E262S|4|As new parents, we all seem to worry about SIDS and if our child is breathing and okay when they are sleeping. Because we care for them so deeply, we always feel the need to constantly check on them and tend not to get the rest we need as parents.<br /><br />The design is a little interesting but nothing to get too hung up on. You place a sensor beneath the mattress in your baby's crib and it will beep and alert you if it has not detected move or breathing in 20 seconds. Knowing that this product is monitoring my daughter the entire time that she sleeps was such a precious gift to me.<br /><br />For us, this went off a few times but thankfully our daughter was just in a really, deep sleep and was sleeping kind of off the middle of the sensor. We would just move her back to the middle without waking her up and back to sleep we went.<br /><br />This for us was money well spent. It paid off big time and was extremely useful for us!
B000058CC7|5|We have several types of gates in our home for a toddler and a dog. We had one of these gates, between our kitchen and living room. When we broke a different gate in another location, we replaced it with one of these hands free gates. Very convenient to open when your hands are full. We also have a staircase that we've blocked access to with gates on each side of the foyer using these hands free gates. Also swings in or out. Great invention.
B00EV1FH8E|5|SUPER CUTE, INCLUDES A  MESH LINER FOR THE INSIDE THAT REMOVES TO THROW THE LAUNDRY IN THE WASH! BRILLIANT & BEAUTIFUL
B003HS5JMQ|5|This backpack is precious and my daughter loves it. The only problem I have is that it says it's like 9x12x4in I believe or something close to that which is bigger then a 8x10 piece of paper yet one barely fits in it...Just smaller then it says.
B000Q7G3VM|4|I love this photo album. I bought it for my one year old son. He loves looking at pictures of his family and friends. It has held up well through a few months use. Also returned to buy my cousin one as well as she loved it too! Only problem I had was the plastic pages stick together. That makes it hard to insert photos.
B004RL1IMC|4|We were looking for a basic guard device that would keep a child from opening the door. This was easy to install and works good. I installed at about 6 feet height in a few minutes. Only problem is that once closed from inside you can no longer open the door from the outside.
9729375011|4|We received our first baby tracker as a gift when our son was born, and initially we thought it was simply to keep track of things so that we could share this info with the pediatrician.  As time went by, it became useful in figuring out his sleep patterns, following eating tendencies, and tracking his diaper events if you catch my drift.    This book has become even more helpful since my wife and I split baby duties.  It makes it very easy to see at a glance when he last ate and how much or when his diaper was last changed.    Each page is set up like a spreadsheet with columns for napping, eating, diaper change, play, and comments.  There are also areas for the date and totalling how much he eats in case that's an issue.    The only things that I wish were different about this book are:  1) It would be nice if the hours had alternating shading, i.e. odd hours are shaded and even hours are not.  This would make it easier to see the times.  2) It would be nice if this were available in a loose leaf version, but that's just a personal preference. It would be great to have a thin binder that holds like 14 pages to take in the diaper bag, but then have a large binder for archiving old pages.    Overall, I can highly recommend this book.
B0054G1234|4|for the price, this is a very nice, study crib. directions were relatively easy to understand, assembly was quick. my only complaint is that there were a few very minor paint chips on the railing. our baby hasn't arrive yet, but i expect this will be plenty sturdy to withstand your average toddler. arrived on-time and packaged nicely.
B002BXOMJY|4|My little guy loves it.
B00CWN3FNW|3|I like many aspects of this bouncer:  It does vibrate and have some music or bird sounds.  The rabbit ears thing is cute, but it does kind of slide a lot.  It's a sturdy bouncer and we havent had any problems with that aspect of it.<br /><br />Where the buttons are, by the feet, is a silly placement.  My baby slides down, or sinks down and he is a kicker and always bicycle legs and ends up kicking the hard plastic with his heal, which is silly.  They should put that control board somewhere else, not directly under where the baby feets are a kicking.<br /><br />Also, the birds dangling from the leaf and very bland and boring looking.  I don't mind the neutral tones, but these birds are about as boring as it gets, with little dots for eyes and little nothing else.  Bla, babies want cooler things to look at.
B00CSAWJQ8|5|Sturdy and fun!  My 20mo old loves to flush it and has already peed in it!  Yay!
B003HS5JRG|5|My 5 month old really likes this toy. It is the first squeaker that he can make squeak on his own (wacking it or slaping it). I like that the sound is not as annoying.
B009DJKHPW|5|It's perfect for my daughter. The band-aids stick really well. There are also two free re-fills that come with it.
B00QMRJBL4|5|Super soft, amazingly soft!!!!
B004DC9TA8|4|I'll just address a few points that I had while researching this stroller and then finally using it.<br /><br />I'm male, height a tad over 6' tall.  My kid is 33\\" tall.<br /><br />I have no issues w/the height of the handlebars.  Yeah, it'd be nice if they were adjustable but I'm comfortable w/the height.<br />Yes, when retracted the canopy could be an issue for my kid.  I don't think it's impossible to pull the material up and away from his head but I do think that's a tad annoying.  The more likely scenario will just probably be to mostly use it with the canopy open.<br />And in my opinion, a handbrake wouldn't be a bad idea.  This thing *goes* and when I was running downhill for the first time, I thought a brake would be necessary for some people.<br />I also think the wrist strap should be attached to the base of the stroller and not the bars.<br /><br />But overall, this is a huge step up from the Chicco stroller I was using.  Lush and plush.
B000AV7O4O|4|I think this is a nice product. My only problem is that when I tried to use the suction cups it kept falling off the wall. I ended up using the adhesive it comes with, but I am in the military and move frquently, so I don't know how I'll get it to stay on at our next house. Overall, it is cute and function.
B007X63CYK|5|Great price! I'm excited to make tutus for my little girl!
B0019QCGVK|5|My 4 month old nephew LOVES this thing.  He always has it in his mouth.  And I just found out it has a squeaker in the orange section of the star.
B00ARTRNY0|5|I love using these to make burp cloths, I usually add some cute embroidery or appliqu&eacute; to them. They're nice and absorbent and the colors add something over just the plain white ones. They also make excellent cleaning rags once baby has outgrown them.
B000M133D8|5|I have used the cover several times.  Does keep out the rain and let the GreatGrandSon look around.  The only problem was the wind.  It had a tendency to want to lift when sitting still.  Otherwise it really was what I was hoping for.  Thank You!
B003TJAGCQ|5|My biggest concern was the cord length because I planned to use my pump in the back seat where the windows are tinted. The cord is plenty long enough for me to plug it into the center console and sit in any seat in the car. It sure beats refilling the pump with batteries all the time!
B00KZTY8N6|5|These are great! Perfect to catch drool and keep clothes dry.
B000JJK9EY|4|My husband and I previously purchased one of the car seats that pops out into a stroller only to give up on it in disgust because it constantly collapsed itself, usually landing with a hard bump with my daughter in it. This seemed like a nice alternative and I just used it to take my daughter to Canada by myself. It worked fantastically, enabling me to either push my daughter through the airport or push my carry-on bag when she wanted to walk. I didn't need a separate stroller as my daughter is 2.5 and likes to walk so it made my carry-on load very light. The only disadvantages have been pointed out by previous reviewers - screwing the screws on and off takes way too long, especially when going through security. Again, whether or not you can get away with a wand wave depends on the airport, the time of day, the phases of the moon, etc. Also, it didn't fit down the aisle of the smaller jets we were on but the seat itself wouldn't have fit so the Go-Go Kidz wasn't the problem. Altogether a very nifty solution to carrying a car seat through an airport.
B00DCR5EKE|4|Great gate.  Unfortunately, I did not measure correctly and it ended up not being wide enough by just a little bit.  I was never able to tighten it enoug h to get it completely closed, so I can't review that part.  But it is sturdy and well-made.<br /><br />I did not like the locking mechanism at the bottom.  It kept falling off when I tried to switch it.<br />I had to return because of the size issues. 4 star because of the locking mechanism.
B003KMWATY|5|These work the best for my six month old.  The flow is smooth and at a good pace for him.
B009S4NNZI|5|Love it. It's like having blankie all around. My little one is a big fan.
B0095WCFAC|5|I LOVE these! Best insert I have! Work better than my microfiber, bamboo and hemp inserts. Wish they weren't sold out though, would love to buy more.
B00B1M2U72|5|Our baby loves these and sleeps in them every night.
B000056JIE|1|I purchased these to try to help save the environment.  I go through lots of disposable nursing pads so I thought reusable ones would be a better way to go.  But these were so bulky and uncomfortable I had to quit using them.  Don't waste your money on this product.
B001PBFWMO|3|Convenient. Son doesn't mind it but it is loud.
B002UKKVIY|5|I'm a tough consumer to please so was sceptical. The stroller went together beautiful, it is well made, sturdy, attractive. At the moment I am only using the car seat adaptor which is phenomenal, it sits high over a spacious basket that can be unloaded easily from the front or back. The thing handles effortlessly, with a great turning circle. It has a nice wide handle with soft foam overlay. The wheels are NOT pneumatic, they are solid plastic so this is definitely not an offroad stroller, I'm pretty sure the wheels would not handle that BUT I am only using this for shopping and town stuff. I am delighted as it's so easy to use, putting it up and down is fine, it is a little heavy and big so not for a super small vehicle. Such a relief to get something that is strong and WORKS and looks really nice, lots of admiring glances. Oh, and dropping the infant car seat in is a breeze and secured by an additional strap, so very safe. 10/10 for this, definitely competes with pricier options on the market.
B000056OUO|3|This caddy holds what I need it to hold, but it does not fit over the edge of my particular baby crib- the lip on it is too small/narrow to fit. I wish that had been made more clear in the description. It does not fit all cribs!
B002TUTOVA|3|We were given this high chair as a gift at my baby shower.  We had not registered for a high chair since we knew the baby wouldn't be needing it until closer to 6 months old, but a friend picked this one out for us.  We have the \\"Elyse\\" pattern, which is definitely girly (we elected to wait to find out if we were having a boy or girl until delivery - it's fortunate that we had a girl!).     We have the Chicco Keyfit/Cortina travel system and pack & play and love the ease of use and simplicity of the Chicco products, so we considered returning this chair and applying the store credit towards the Chicco Polly high chair.  My sister-in-law has the Polly high chair and after seeing and using theirs, we're glad we stuck with the Graco Cozy Dinette.      We started putting the baby in the high chair when she was around 3 months old, but since she's breastfed and not on solids yet we didn't have much of a reason to do so frequently.  It was nice to have a safe place in the kitchen where she could play while we got dinner ready or I washed pump parts.  We've started using the high chair more often over the last several weeks because we will be starting to introduce solids in a few weeks when she's 6 months old.        What we like:  ~ The large \\"upper\\" tray is adjustable in position.  ~ Easy adjustment and fastening of the straps and the ability to use the straps as either a 3-point or 5-point harness.  ~ I can get the tray on and off with one hand with no difficulty - I've read the reviews saying otherwise but we have never had that problem.    ~ Easy cleaning of the entire chair.  My husband's sister has the Chicco Polly high chair for her kids and there are tons of crevices and spaces where food becomes trapped easily.  Quite frankly, it's disgusting and hard to clean and I am glad that the Graco Cozy Dinette is so easy to clean!        What we don't like:  ~ The footprint that the chair's legs take up is substantial - however this is no different from any other full size high chair on the market.  Right now we eat primarily in our eat-in kitchen and the chair takes up a lot of space, so we have to fold it between meals.  ~ It can't be unfolded with one hand.  I often have the baby in arms and needing both hands to fold/unfold is inconvenient.  It would be nice if there was a one-hand fold/lock mechanism.     Overall this is a good high chair.  My only regret is that we didn't exchange it for a more gender-neutral pattern since we will be having more kids in the future and if we have a boy the Elyse pattern will not work.       Edit 7/18/2011 - I want to like this high chair, I really do. Unfortunately our rating has dropped to only three stars now that our daughter is almost a year old and is eating table food.     The fabric cover, while attractive and comfortable for the baby, gets filthy very easily with a self-feeding baby or toddler.  We bought an aftermarket plastic-coated high chair cover that does a bit better but we were still washing the cover every other day.  Finally we decided to just use the high chair without any cover at all so that we can wipe it down after each meal.  And it's really NOT as easy to clean as I had thought.  While easier to clean than the Chicco Polly, there are flower-shaped plastic things at the corners of the tray that require a Scotchbrite pad to get clean.  Naturally since these pieces are close to the baby's hands, they get disgusting easily.  There are also a few crevices that are annoying.      Honestly, I think we'd have these issues with any of the plastic high chairs on the market.  Now that our daughter is older we are going to be getting a [[ASIN:B0044R7G66 Keekaroo Height Right High Chair, Infant Insert and Tray Combo, Natural/Lime]]. We want a chair with a smaller footprint, easier cleaning, and more attractive appearance.  We will keep the Graco for a future baby to use up until the start of self-feeding.
B0000936M4|5|My husband, a Dr., did 6 mos. of research on bottles alone before our first child was born. I think he quizzed every nursery, NICU, L&amp;D and any other nurse who either worked with babies or was a grandmother! (Not to mention almost every pediatrician!) He estimated he questioned about 150-200 people total and only 12 had ever heard of them, but all of them used Dr. Brown's. Including my cousin whose then newborn son had a cleft palate. Out of the rest the 1st place went to a five letter brand - A _ _ _ t.  He insisted that we try them but just like most new mommies I wanted to use what a vast majority of the other mommies were using - &quot;the other brand&quot;.  We used &quot;the other brand&quot; for three weeks and my daughter would spit up after every other bottle and have horrible gas constantly.  I finally gave in and he proudly rushed to get Dr. Brown's. Needless to say she never had another problem - not one! My cousin also waited until I gave up using the others to tell me that her son reduced his gas and spitup by 75%! My husband tells everyone expecting about Dr. Brown's and our personal experience.  He has even had some of the nurses and other Dr.'s tell him that they switched. (The word under the table is that most of the others at the hospital that used &quot;the other brands&quot; have switched and love them also!) Lesson learned- I guess he can be right...this time.
B006XHO7CG|3|Way too big for my little one when he was born and did not fit until he was 2 months and closer to ten lbs.<br />The zipper swaddles are a better option when babies are little so they fit appropriately
B002LHP90G|4|I like the pattern.  It's durable, and the color is pretty.  Just the material is a little bit hard.  After washing several times, it's still not very soft.
B005HJ2CWS|5|As described
B00D6VGTNM|5|I wasn't sure about ordering beddjng with this type of material, but it's great and my daughter loves it.
B00208RY2C|5|These rail guards are great.  Wish I had them on hand before my daughter started teething.  :)  They are cute, bright and waterproof!  A must for any nursery!
B004QZBEFK|5|These are great little containers.  Perfect for taking a little bit of something like sauce or dressing. I got the 4 oz size too. Not just for baby food.  Come part for easy cleaning and seal well.
B00G49RSWO|1|The sheet itself is fine, however, it was advertised as fitting a 13&#34; x 29&#34; bassinet mattress, but it is actually a pack and play sheet with  dimensions of 27&#34; x 39&#34;.
B00DKWBMAC|2|Breast shield had bumpy, rigid plastic that injured me when used. Took a while to heal. Other parts were satisfactory. Would not repurchase.
B000ZPJT5W|5|I love this bag. I used it to go to disney and have no complaints. The section that holds diapers and changing needs was geat. Made changing soo much easier than digging around
B002GKC5PU|2|Opened the box and the couch smells like nasty toxic chemicals.  Can't unzip and wash cover - it's just ultra-chemically treated to prevent any stains.  I had to put it out on the porch - hope it airs out and the smell dissipates.  When the couch unfolds, the sections aren't even - seems like it would be uncomfortable to lay on.  It's super-hard too.
B002ZYNTSY|1|I'm returning this.  The fabric is way too flimsy to work as a hands-free pumping bra.  I ordered this because the zipper on my Medela pumping bra broke, so I wanted a bra without a zipper.  Alas, the fabric of this bra is too silky/flimsy and there isn't an elastic band for added support.
B0055949N0|5|The Sit n Stroll is invaluable for traveling.  Great in airports, then in cabs or vans to and from hotels. It is also a great booster seat for mealtime!<br /><br />Lilly Gold customer support is truly amazing!  I needed the item rush delivered and Lilly Gold contacted me herself.  Then when it didn't arrive within the promised time, due to shippers fault, not theirs, they jumped through hoops to get me one delivered next day at their own expense!!!  They also threw in a bunch of extra's and refunded my expediting costs.  I wish all companies had this kind of customer service!!!!!!!
B000056OUX|4|Good for the price. Doesn't look that appealing in your house but serves its purpose. Lots of strings to tie.
B00171WXII|5|We bought every nasal apparatus on the market for our 2 month old with a cold, after spending a fortune and being let down we found this. It works like a dream, its easy to use and the baby (now 9 months) never minds it. I recommend this to all new parents!
B00JX88O8U|5|This necklace is absolutely gorgeous. I waited a bit to see if it would help my preemie with her reflux, & it has. I'm so grateful for this. I've been able to increase her feedings as well as lower her Zantac dosage, & she is tolerating it very well. I put the necklace around her ankle at night, & I read somewhere that soaking it in warm water helps the absorption. I will be ordering again!
B0081U0EM0|4|I'm happy with the purchase. The items are just as described.  My little one is going through that drooling stage. I have found that these don't have to be changed as frequently as some other brands.
B00006966I|5|I am an NICU-RN and at first I fed my baby exculsively with avent bottles. I never experienced any leaking with the bottles but my baby was still making bubbles in the bottles and had tremendous gas. Baby would be sleeping comfortably and then wake up abruptly crying from belly/gas pains. I tried the gas drops but nothing worked. At about six weeks old I had had enough and got the playtex ventair bottles (regular size, not natural-wide nipple shape) and stage 2 nipples (my baby gets a small amount of rice cereal in her formula per her pediatrian). These bottles have been wonderful. We have had no bubbles, no gas and the special cross cut on the nipples do not continually drip like regular nipples so baby only gets food when she sucks. We have also had much less gas and she seems more content and happy throughout the day and night. I have also not had any trouble with the vent disks or leaking. I just make sure that the bottle is dry when I put it together. I have a bottle drying rack (by prince lionheart that is carried by babies r us) that makes life much easier and I put the pieces on after I wash them and they dry quickly. The playtex ventair also have less pieces and are easier to clean then Dr. Browns bottles which are also good for less gas. Also, another review said that these would not work in a bottle warmer. However, I have been warming mine in the avent bottle warmer, just take off the top/nipple while warming, and it has done just fine.
B00B3NB9US|5|My son can be out with my husband when he mows the lawn, works in his woodshop, etc. They have a lot of room for him to grow, so we will definitely get our money's worth.
B0098YTBCW|4|I like this cover because it can be simply a bug shield or sun cover and protect against uv rays. However,  the elastic does stretch out putting it on and off.
B002HGQVPI|5|These are the best invention ever.  Wish I had had them for all of my kids!
B003H4QFPA|5|I like this stroller quite a bit. It is of a higher quality than most of the jogging strollers out there and on par with most other high-end strollers while remaining at a very fair price, in my opinion (cost is subjective though).    Pros:    -Folds and unfolds easily  -Has an enormous hood, offering more protection from the sun and the elements than ANY other stroller on the market  -Has very comfortable handles that are at a good height for anyone to comfortably push it, that is unless you are Andre the Giant's twin brother  -Has plenty of reflective markers on it for safety  -The recline function is unmatched; you can place a very young infant in this stroller, replacing the need for a carseat compatable stroller; you can also change your baby's diaper easily in it as a result, if need be   -Has an excellent turning radius thanks to it's wonderful wheels which provide a nearly silent ride and absorb most of the shocks that strollers are heir to beautifully  -It comes with a custom rain cover (I haven't been able to put it on properly yet, but that is my issue. I imagine it will work quite nicely once I get it figured out)  -It comes with a very useful, waterproof neoprene cup holder and cellphone/wallet cubby that attaches easily to the handles  -The front wheel pops off for ease of storage  -It has an enormous under seat storage basket  -The stroller is huge inside and outside; I think you could comfortably use this with a child up to the 75 pound limit, my son is still quite young and he positively swims in this thing    Cons:  -I like this particular aspect of the stroller, but I imagine many people will not; it is a minimalist, utilitarian stroller. Not many bells or whistles  -As noted above, it is huge. Some people may not appreciate that aspect, but I do. Just don't expect that you can take this beast to the mall or some such place. It would be incredibly awkward to say the least. Also, you need a vehicle large enough to accommodate transporting this thing. Even folded with the wheel removed, it is very large, and quite heavy to boot    All in all, I like this stroller quite a bit.    Edited to add that over the winter, at some point, either my husband or myself ran it over unknowingly. It was damaged in such a way that I could not open it. I took it in to my Mechanic and he was able to fix it so that it functions again, but does still look a bit wonky when folded. That said, after having been run over by a large SUV, it still works fine! So if you're accident prone...this stroller is for you!
B002MPZYX4|5|Easy replacement for our Summer Infant monitor battery which died after about 2 years of use.  This one has been working great.
B003KN27EG|5|I purchased the BundleMe after seeing a friend of mine using it during a morning jog. Living in Japan can get pretty cold during the winter months and this was perfect. I love it. She has a BOB and it fit perfect, I had a Schwinn jogging stroller and had no problems. I would highly recommend this. There were times I didn't even need to bundle my son in a coat because he would get too hot.
B00L9NR672|5|This is absolutely awesome.  Very quiet, super easy to operate, and I'm probably going to buy two more.  A friend of mine was over the other day and liked it so much she ordered one right then and there for her son for Christmas.  Seriously, very nice and very soothing.
B001NAATW0|5|I have 9-month old twins, and over the months I've bought or received a ton of baby items. Absolutely none of them have been as valuable as this video monitor.  With a regular audio-only monitor, it would be very hard to know when our babies went to sleep (as opposed to just being quiet) or if they awoke, when they were trying to go back to sleep and when they were really ready to get up. We'd have to try an interpret their sounds. But with the video, we can see exactly what they are doing in their cribs. The quality of both the video and the audio is really good, even at night.  Sure its not high-def, but its good enough to see what position the babies are in, what they are doing and whether they are trying to get comfortable and go back to sleep or whether they want to get up. It has helped us help them become much better sleepers, and isn't that what every parent wants?    I was able to purchase a second camera from the Summer Company directly and it was a cinch to set up with the monitor. That allowed me to easily go back and forth between the two cameras when the twins were in different rooms.    The only thing I found odd is the light that indicates the camera is on; it seems unnecessarily bright in a dark room and doesn't serve any purpose other than to let you know the camera is on.So I just put a little piece of electrical tape over it: problem solved.    In short I love this monitor and it will be what I get for shower gifts from now on. I recommend it to everyone I know who is having a baby.
B000F78UAU|1|This chair served its purpose for the first year but started to completely fall apart in a year. The wooden handles on both sides competely fell off. It doesn't rock at this point as most of the bolts have fallen out. Very disappointed.
B00IZOR49S|1|Don't buy this product. Very inconvenient to use regularly. Good for cabinet doors you don't intend to open more than once or twice a year!
B00171WXII|5|Admittedly, the thought of sucking the snot out of someone's head seemed, at first, something only zombie's should be doing. But seeing as how our sweet 6 week old was just miserable with a stuffy nose, I made the shift of thought and prepared myself (the several hundreds of other, stellar, reviews made it easier to take the leap of faith).  Almost immediately after ordering the NoseFrida, my attitude shifted even moreso to anxiously awaiting it.  Fast forward to this morning (4 days after ordering, standard... dumb mistake), and my mindset was full-blown desperation. I was frothing at the mouth as I demanded my obliging husband stalk the mail carrier for this package, otherwise I was going to drive the 40 miles away to where they sold it and have it today no matter what.    Well, my Amazon friends, it was worth the frothiness. It arrived. We jumped for joy. We cleaned it. We used it. She smiled. And is smiling still... ahhhhhh....    The item itself comes in a disposable plastic box package (unlike earlier versions, which I believe came in a blue reusable box). It has four components: the red mouthpiece, the blue sponge filter, the air tube, and the vacuum nosil.  There are several \\"how to\\" demo's on YouTube - one in particular by DadLabs cracked us up and was at the same time, informative. Very easy to wash, and yes, I did see the snot come out, which left me with a nice sense of accomplishment for the afternoon.    Do not wait to make this purchase. Buy one for a friend (I'm buying three more after I finish this review). Don't wait until you need it.    Cheers!
B00608LMSK|5|The thermometer comes in handy when you have a fussy baby who refuses to stay still and need to know if they have a fever. Medicine dropper same way
B00005V9NV|1|I will not buy these again.  They are tiny, thick and do not tapper on the edges.  This means you will see the lines thru your shirts. The adhesive isn't enough and the pads shifted durring the night.  I highly recommend the Lansinoh or Medela, they cover more, are thinner and stick better.
B000RFCXIK|5|Of all the dispensers I got this one is the best. The seal is the tightest and super easy to use.
B005IWM99K|5|I love this. We have a counter height table with stools for seats. Our baby can get right to the table and feel like part of the family. VERY secure!
B004GEC8LU|5|safe with high back, water bottle holder, comfy fit and my grandson loves the colors. easy snap in and roomy
B002ETXCEG|1|These plates are very nice looking but after using them for couple of months they are just impossible to clean. Neither by hand wash (i.e. scrubbing) or dishwasher.  I used them only for some basic toddler foods like mashed potatoes, quiche, pasta and the food residue just wouldn't come off the plates.
B000CRCPCW|1|Not only does the shade not stay in place very well, when you can get it to stay up, the wrinkles in the shade itself make it VERY hard to see through.  I'm returning it.  Not worth a dollar.
B000LY3W00|4|My little girl loves this.  She runs around and around.  The reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because the top part doesn't secure on tightly so it doesn't stay in one place.  When you lift it up to move it sometimes the base comes off as well.  This only works good on tile or hardwood.  It's hard to move on carpet.  It's a great buy and worth it if you have a little one that needs to get energy out.
B00MXRPVES|5|A little tighter then I thought it would be but love it!
B0057TZZIQ|5|This has been my son's favorite toy BY FAR (from 3 months to current 15 months). He loves his \\"Mr. Bee\\" so much I had to buy a second one just to be sure I had a back up in case anything happened to the original.
B0000798L0|5|this tub side seat is great because: <br /> <br />1) it is a very roomy storage box for all of your munchkins bathtime toys (with a lid that the munchkin can't take off himself) <br />2) it is a durable seat <br />3) it is a safe stepping stool that doesn't slip <br /> <br />it has proved to be very useful.
B002SW3EZG|5|A necessity for any music loving baby.
B003JQR69U|5|It works great. My son is all over the TV stand and luckily can no longer get to the DVD player. Very easy to install and remove, making putting in a DVD very easy yet hard enough your little one won't be able to remove.<br />Will get anther one so he can't push the Dvr buttons.
B000FU76DE|2|I bought this sling when my son was 8 months old and 19 pounds. He hated this carrier because he couldn't turn around and see the world. I hated this carrier because the rigid straps cut into my hips and shoulder every time he tried to move. The seller recommended making sure the straps were place correctly (I tried numerous positions. There isn't a place on your body where unforgiving straps are particularly comfortable) and also said to tighten the straps so the baby couldn't move around. I did all of these things and still found it very uncomfortable to wear. The seller was helpful and the product arrived promptly, so I gave it 2 stars instead of 1. (Note: there is a $5 return charge.) <br />
B001KRO94K|4|I bought this to go with our extra tall gate.  It's really sturdy and blends well into our staircase.  Since our stairway has spindles on both sides, I added extra protection by using the plastic ties to hold it more securely in place.
B000MVQBG4|1|Loved the product worked great for holding tub toys, unfortunately I had to throw it out because it had pink mold growing within 2 months of using it despite regular cleanings with vinegar.
B00PY2RFL6|5|I have have used Halo SleepSacks for every one of my children from when they were newborns through the toddler years. They are great quality and withstand washing well. (Note: I line dry the cotton SleepSacks to prevent shrinkage and wear, but use a dryer for all others). Kids are able to move freely in SleepSacks, and they also stay warm. My kids did not like using blankets when they were toddlers, so these worked very well. There are so many patterns, colors, materials, and sizes to chose from - one of the best baby/toddler products available.
B00CV3NN4E|5|These are pretty cool!  I bought them for my kids to play at the beach in the evenings.  These kept them entertained for a good period of time.  They don't come with the instructions, but if you just fold at the white lines and then make them look like a T in the picture you are good.  They shoot up and come right back to you.  My 2.5 year old nephew was even able to get them to work.  You can turn the light on/off.
B0016JMC96|5|These are exactly what is shown in the picture and look adorable in my son's room!  I wish you could buy the matching curtain to go with it all as a set because that would make it even better....now I am on a hunt to get the perfect match!  But I do highly recommend the valence.
B0015VY3N8|5|We love this seat.  We have two (one in each car) and have been using them for 4 weeks now.  Since children in Michigan (and many other states) have to be in boosters so long, we decided to spend the extra money on a more expensive seat (this one) and we have nothing but great things to say about it.  It is easy to use and my daughter feels secure in it.  I look forward to using it in the summer to see how much difference the mesh makes with the sweating factor.
B005ZBHZDO|4|I bought this product for my twenty eight month old son. We loved the product very much since it is soft which is must for the baby to make use of it again and again. It won't splash outside that much when compare to similar products. Very easy to clean. And the downside of the product is, the suction cup of this product is not working so the seat moves here and there. And mine got broke within use of 3 to 4 months but my boy got trained meanwhile. So we didn't have the necessity to buy again. If we had the situation to buy again sure I'll give a try for this product again and may handled with much care.
B00GUN3Z1W|5|I purchased these to keep my dogs out of certain rooms.  They worked.  I'm very pleased.
B010E7QCTG|5|This silicone teething necklace is a complete genius idea. First, it is very fashion forward so if a mom wore it, it would not stand out as ugly, but cute and fun. Then, on top of that the baby would be able to chew on it to relieve the pain they were in. It is 100% safe for babies and has FDA approved silicone so I do not have to worry about my baby girl. It is really nice that the silicone can be put in the freezer like regular teethers as well. My daughter loves the ice cold temperature in her mouth when she is in pain so this is a huge win for us. I could see this as an awesome gift for a new mom. The colors are so pretty together and very fashionable. I received this product in exchange for my honest review and I would highly recommend it!
B00CXGQOJU|5|I've used a lot of sippy cups over the years and my biggest complaint with them has always been how annoying the valves are to clean.  You have to pluck them out and clean them separately than the cup because if you don't, they will grow mold.  Gross!  I decided to give these cups a shot because they have no valve and I read other reviews saying they don't leak.  Sounded good to me!  I've had them for a few months now and I love them!  NO valves to clean out and it's true - there is little to no leakage when dropped on the floor.  When dropped from highchair height, it is possible for the lid to pop loose a little and cause some spilling, but for the most part we have been really pleased with the ease of use and the non-leakiness of these cups!
B00FFAS2SW|2|The rating is for the product. The Kinder wagon is great when you first receive it. It looks and works great ... until about 3 weeks in. After awhile, the wheels become stiff and hard to push, I did not take this thing offroading or any kinda of unusual use or environment. The stroller was used in New York City and 3 other major cities. Then the stroller will start to feel wobbly and not as strong. As far as folding it up, it's really not that compact and takes up my whole trunk space. Now please keep in mind that this is a double stroller and because they stress it's compactness,  it's still a double stroller and there is no brilliant innovative design that has addressed that with this product. The maneuverability of the Kinder wagon is awesome compared to other double strollers and it is a lot less bulky compared to others on the market. The rain cover we received was ripped and unusable and I'm sure that is not a common occurrence I'm guessing. When buying this product I would recommend buying in store where you can return it if it does not work out for you with ease or buy from amazon prime/ fba. I'm thinking this is a hit or miss with some people. I purchased from Amazon but from an independent seller, Lullaby Baby, and it has been a headache dealing with them. They are extremely slow to respond to my messages to them and refused to pay for return shipping. After a few weeks of slow responses (literally about 5 emails back and forth took a week or two from slow responses), they finally pawned me off to kinder wagon for a factory return. This is a large and heavy item to ship so imagine the shipping costs. I understand why Lullaby Baby does not want to pay for return shipping. This is why I suggest purchasing the product from a local brick and mortar business or Amazon Prime/FBA and not from small online retailers. You will have peace of mind in knowing that you are not stuck with a product, after 3 weeks of use , changes condition or rapidly declines in performance. If you don't mind paying for return shipping then by all means try out this stroller from retailers like Lullaby Baby, and hopefully you don't get an experience like mine.
B0038W0JJ4|5|It never fails to satisfy those who is looking for safety and qualified carseat. You will see that your son/daughter will happy with this carseat. I have no doubt Britax produce guaranteed safety ones.
B001OC5UNK|2|Too wide (by one inch) with both inserts and not wide enough with either of the single inserts.  Won't work.  Will try to sell it locally or return it :(
B004044LD4|5|Love it
B00EYDTTHE|5|These are amazing quality bibs, love that they are waterproof and the box they came in is great, I plan on using it to store my sons photos! Definitely a good buy.
B000F1SCJK|5|perfect to fit under the stroller when you don't want to bring the whole big diaper bag
B004CLZH9W|3|This baby monitor works OK and wasn't difficult to set-up--we had it up and running in about 20 minutes--but the bells and whistles (flashlight, lullabies, two-way communication, temperature control) seem to be of little real value. The flashlight in particular is pretty worthless. If you take the parent unit, which has the light, into the child's room and put it next to the child's unit, there's a loud interference noise ... meaning you don't want this thing anywhere near your child with the volume on for fear of waking them.<br /><br />I also can't imagine a situation where the two-way communication or lullaby function would be useful. If your child is all-out crying (at least my child), putting on a song or saying, \\"hush baby\\" through an intercom isn't going to help them drift off to sleep. And if they're just slightly fussing, and not fully awake, the last thing I'd want to do is introduce a new noise (music or my voice) that is guaranteed to fully wake them up. There's just no way around it: if the baby is screaming at 3 AM, you're going in there.<br /><br />Also, like most of these products, the actual range is quite a bit less, far less than half, the stated range. While it worked fine from my child's room to ours (on same half of house), taking the parent unit outside it quickly went \\"out of range\\", even on the \\"long\\" setting, even though we were hundreds of feet away (albeit through a brick wall), not the \\"2,000 ft.\\" advertised by the maker's of this monitor. That's a major disappointment as my main hope for this monitor was greater range than our current video monitor, which only works for about 100 feet and can't even be used throughout the house. And while this audio monitor did have greater range--it seemed to work in all corners of our approximately 4,000 sq. ft. home--it's not something we could use to, say, sit outside and read a book while the baby is napping, confident we would hear him when he woke up.<br /><br />The charging station (only for the parent unit; child's unit must be plugged in or powered by standard AA batteries) and units are small and seem sturdy and the signal, once you find a good channel, is relatively clear.<br /><br />This monitor works well for simply audio monitoring but, for the price, it's hard to justify, especially considering the extras it offers aren't really that useful--at least not for this parent. If you're going to spend this much, I'd suggest a video monitor, which I find a lot more useful. There is nothing like being able to SEE your child is OK after hearing a noise. Is he really awake or just fussing and might fall back asleep? Eyes open or closed? No audio monitor can tell you what video can at a glance.it must be plugged in or powered by standard AA batteries) and units are small and seem sturdy and the signal, once you find a good channel, is relatively clear.

B0009A1DR0|4|The Imse Vimse covers are nice in that they are roomy enough for a fitted diaper, fit well around the waist & legs and will contain even big messes. They also hold up well in the wash; I've put them in the same sanitizing cycle as the diapers and dried them both on the line and in the dryer with good results. Their lightweight construction helps them to dry very quickly, too. The seams are smooth, nothing to scratch your diaperee's skin, and the cover is available in several styles & prints.  However: the lack of laundry tabs on the fastening sides mean that you either need to re-fasten the soiled cover when placing it into the laundry pail (kind of a pain as this might require both hands), or deal with the resulting \\"laundry snake\\" when the loose hook & loop fasteners snag other items in the wash. Additionally, these come in separate sizes rather than incorporating the \\"growth snaps\\" used by some other brands; this means that you will need to purchase more than one set of covers as your diaperee grows.
B000Y8TXS8|5|This is a great product. I had just a plain white terry cloth cover for my first daughter but couldn't find it for my second so I bought this one and it is so snuggle soft and so cute - I just love it.
B00H0LEMEM|5|These dolls are great - soft, washable and mendable by anyone who knits.<br /><br />We like the minis - easy to carry around.
B001NAAQQE|4|These inserts were recommended to me by a friend and I really like using them. Hemp is SO absorbent, and I like using natural fibers. I use two of these during the day, or three of them for overnights inside of a [[ASIN:B003AJXY1U Thirsties Duo Wrap Snap, Meadow, Size One (6-18 lbs)]] and I don't think I've ever had a leak. My only complaints are that the inserts are cut a tiny bit too wide so they push my baby's legs apart more than some other cloth diapers, and also that hemp can start to smell funky if you don't use a tiny bit of bleach after every few washes. Overall these are great inserts and I would not hesitate to recommend them.
B0052QYLUM|4|It's a reliable baby monitor device, works well, simple to operate and really affordable.
B002968T5G|3|I don't really see how anyone could wear this under their clothing to work.  The velcro is somewhat annoying and it doesn't give bra like support.  That being said, I work at home, so it's easy for me to strap this on over my regular nursing bra and then work away while I pump.
B004G8QN6C|5|The fleece is pretty heavy so I have my baby wear a long sleeve, legless onsie and she's plenty warm at night!
B000067K0L|5|My 5 month old boys love their Gymnis.  They grab at the toys, love looking in the mirror, love the lights and music.  It's a great toy!  It folds in half and tucks away nicely.  Machine washable, too.
B0032FOOPM|5|I love this baby gate. We actually got it for our puppies, but it's sturdy enough that I'm sure we will be able to use it when we have kids as well.
B006T89X9Q|5|These worked really well for my son when he was two weeks old and I went back to work.
B00067AUP2|5|Baby loves this in his crib. It fits snugly under the fitted sheet, and allows him to lie in his crib at a slight angle, which helps if he has a cough or a lot of spit-up, and it makes me feel at ease.
B000HZI1R2|5|this is the best nursing pillow. i've tried all of them and have a boppy too but this one is better. the buckle holds everythig in place and he doesn't move all over the place like with the boppy. it has a convenient pocket for spit rags and whatnot. the deluxe has the buckle so the belt stays in the same spot every time and you don't have to velcro and make noise each time. it's a good deal and comes with the pillow cover unlike the boppy. it's not perfect, i still have to put a pillow underneath to get to the right height but no other pillow out there is that high. i definitely reccommend.
B002NV0VM6|3|I have this in white as well and its okay. The zipper drives me nutty: doesn't always work well and often comes unzipped. Once I get it on though it works okay. I like my Shaperee bra better, as its easier to get on and off and adjustable as well.
B005WGO562|5|We purchased this item after scouring the reviews for all sort of products like this one.  I splurged for the Paisley pattern and I'm so happy I did.  You're looking at Little One and the cart constantly, so get the pattern you'll enjoy.  Most importantly, however, it fits every cart we've tucked it in to.  Target, Harris Teeter (grocery store), even Home Depot.  We love our buggy cover and don't leave home without it.
B00O8RC9AA|5|The sheets fit great and arrived exactly as pictured. The crib skirt does have the slits to fit a standard sized crib properly.
B00AR12LQS|5|This is the best diaper I have for my son.  What I do not like is it did not  on time
B000AV5LZ8|4|This Chair Worked Great For My Stubborn 3 Year Old Who Has Absolutely 0 Interest At All In Potty Training... I Tried Everything With Him. Standing Like His Brother Wasn't A Option Since He's A Shorty And Can't Quite Reach, The Floor Potty Chairs Just Wasn't Good Enough He Wanted The Real Deal If He Was Going To Try At All And The Regular Potty Seats That Go On The Toilet He Was Having A Issue Getting Up There By Himself And Keeping It Steady At The Same Time. (I Have 3 Boys Under 5 So Hard For Me To Always Help Him Get U And Down, On Top Of He Is Extremely inDependent And Wants No Help At All.) This Chair Covered All The Problems. That And It Being His OWN chair Just For Him Was Something Special To Him Too. The Only Issue With The Chair I Had Is The Legs Are A Little Wobbly And My Mikey Is A Big Kiddo And TheLegs Were Barely Holding Up To His Weight. Other Then That This Chair Did The Trick. My Extremely Stubborn Diape Loving Sweetheart Has Been In No Diapers (Except For At Night) For A Ween  Thanks To This Chair And The&#34;Potty Watch&#34; I Also Purchased Off Amazon That I Highly Recommend I Can Say My Baby Is On The Right Track Of Being Almost Fully Potty Trained (Thank You Lord)!!!
B000066CMV|5|I purchased this for when I was breast feeding my daughter and this allowed me to pump wherever I went, if I didn't want to feed in public. Very easy to clean and assemble. A little pricey, but well worth it.
B000067PQ0|3|I had a hard time getting my son to latch on and this shield helped out a lot with that. My big problem was that he would get so mad when it was time to feed that he would knock it off. I got really frustrated trying to keep it on while trying to get him to latch.
B000067QFN|5|We received this as a gift and have loved them.  The blankets are large and quite soft.  Some of the other receiving blankets that we received were too small (even for our 7 pound baby).  We went back and purchased a few more after our son was born.
B00BGP1H4G|5|I wish my baby would get here so I could use the stroller!  I love the grey and orangish red combo color!<br />It's the only jogging stroller that the handle bar can adjust to my height (5'3&#34;) and I didn't feel like the stroller with the carseat on it was huge.  It feels like such a great product with just the pushing i've done around the house.  It folds up so compact that I feel as though it would fit in any car trunk.
B005WH3R9M|5|Personally, I love the look of this car seat, but it's also very comfortable for my toddler. When she falls asleep her head doesn't hang down and she sits high so she can see out the front window and side windows. I have a 2 door and it fits well in my small car, with lots of comfort for the kid!
B001AH5WG4|5|Works wonderful for my little guy he is a little bit of a side hog and sleeps with his face buried in the breathable mesh so I feel very comfortable with this bumper, the quality is nice and goes great with his room décor!!
B00A4B34IA|4|Good
B000YEMBRC|5|My daughter won't be able to wear these for a few month now, but they are very cute and I like the colors (we got the brown/pink).
B0007V63SA|5|I seriously think those that have a problem with this gate perhaps installed it incorrectly.  We had this gate up for over two years and it performed fabulously!  We had a split entry home at the time so it was used *constantly* (had it at the top of the stairs)    I actually don't normally write reviews, but was looking up the information for my sister on which gate we had and saw these reviews (she liked ours so much she wants to get one) and just had to say that we loved this gate!    I know it's spendy, but if you have stairs, it's invaluable!
B005XJ2VGE|5|Happy with my purchase and satisfied with my transaction with the seller.<br /><br />I just hope the straps are more secured because they are easy to slip from the holes<br /><br />I will recommend this to anyone i know, I just hope the chair can be folded so it can be easily transported. Overall, i love it!
B00RYW27QM|5|My son loves this toy! Very well made!
B002UD65R2|5|We have a Chicco Playard (Luna), and this quilted sheet fits perfectly, even after multiple washings!  It is quilted, which makes the mattress a lot more comfortable.  I highly recommend!
B00KGIQYEW|5|This pillowcase is well-made and a perfect size for toddler sized pillows.  It has a nice flap at the opening that wraps around the pillow making the pillow stay put in the case and not shimmy out at night with my sometimes restless sleepers.  It has the feel of a high quality crisp cotton which I really like and I think is cooler for my children's face/head.
B00829U5WY|4|I got this for warmer weather because the Halo fleece swaddles worked great; however this one did not contain my baby's arms nearly as securely, so I had to re-swaddle often. Also the velcro wore out after a couple months. It fit baby well and was comfortable.
B000O7WK2K|4|I gave 4 stars because the sheet hasn't been used and only washed once. I bought these for my baby due in August, so we haven't used them yet, but I really like the color (navy)and feel of fabric. It is a very true navy. They aren't luxurious or designer or anything, but they are a good weight and not so thin you can see through to the mattress or anything. Pretty soft and I think they will continue to soften with multiple washes. They just feel like that kind of fabric. Overall, very pleased.
B0030DFRH0|5|i love these blankets they're large and extremely soft. i have to make myself not order all of them. they are lightweight for warm weather, great for swaddling without overheating.
B00H1AGZ38|2|This product required constant adjusting for me and was hardly hands free due to that. It works great at the beginning of the pumping session if my boobs were full, but it they were only partially full, it was hard to get the suction to allow being hands free. During a pumping session I had to continue to adjust, as my boobs emptied and the heavier the bottles came with milk, the less effective this product was at supporting the weight.
B00AWLZDGS|5|NUK Fast Dry Battery Operated Bottle Rack is really awesome.  Who would have thought a drying rack could dry itself but this battery operated device (4 C batteries) actually cuts drying time in half since it blows air upward onto the bottles.  I love time savers and since we are limited on the number of bottles we have this makes life so much easier.  Smart NUK!
B000JPQFH8|5|This cover is so soft and is a huge improvement over the terrycloth covers I had for the other kids.  I love that there are holes for the changing pad straps, because our first one flipped off twice.  The colors are terrific, because it's difficult to match red toile and cream with pastels.  The ecru is nice---I've ordered more and won't try any others after this!  With experience (this is #4), I also will try to protect the pad from stains by using an extra waterproof pad under her bottom.  Highly recommend trying this product!
B00GRS9UT6|1|My granddaughter loves Minnie and was really excited when I told her that I had a treat for her at bath time.  We opened the package together and took out the toy, and I showed her how to pull the string to get the toy to operate.  She did as instructed, and this toy not only did not move forward in the water - it partially sank in the water!<br /><br />I had relied on Amazon and Disney - two big names - to deliver a quality product.  It is a shame that this experience was a total let-down.<br /><br />Extremely Disappointed
B008X6RH8Q|5|Best deal I've found out there for binkies. Especially since we usually lose one or two a day, its nice to have back ups.
B004PBJNLW|5|Super cute and just the right size for a toddler's lunch. This container is quite deep! Easy to layer and allows generous portions without waiting space. This fits perfectly in her zoo lunchie along with a sippy cup. Also, it is made with thick, durable plastic. Must buy for a little girl!
B0069209KY|3|my two negative comments are:<br />1. it's short of you are a tall person - really could feel my back bending to change my son often when he was a newborn.<br />2. The front protective rail is was short. It really should be much taller. I always watch him and have one hand on the baby, but I just wish it was similar height to the hospital plastic crib, which is very safe.<br /><br />Otherwise it's a good product for what is costs.
B001QKJ9SC|4|Used this for our double doors into our media room. Helps keep my 1 year old out! Does the job well. Maybe a little flimsy since it's only plastic.
B000FTD1PM|2|I own two standard size DaVinci cribs:  Jenny Lind and Kalani in white.  They are fabulous -- very attractive and very sturdy, and despite the relative ease with which infants can create unsightly bite marks on the rails (a problem fixed by using some sort of teething protection) they have been very durable over the years.<br /><br />Sooooo...I didn't hesitate to buy this cradle by the same company.  I was shocked by the poor quality.  Flimsy doesn't even begin to describe this cradle.  The only reason I didn't rate this one star is that I wasn't ever afraid that my baby would come crashing to the floor from the cradle falling apart.  But one should expect more from a purchased product by a very reputable company than it merely not falling apart.  But it seems that MDB/DaVinci skimped big time on this cradle. The axle connecting the two legs is worthless and when you move the cradle you have to be careful to have your hands on both ends so that it all moves as one piece.  It feels like it's made out of popsicle sticks.<br /><br />I donate everything (baby gear, clothing, etc) but I will not donate this since even moving it from my house may strain the cradle enough to become dangerous for any recipient. Any moses basket or inexpensive bassinet is a better investment.
B002L3T9YM|5|my two-month old daughter finds the sound it makes when rattled, and the textures of the links, interesting. it's good to bring when you're out with your baby, takes up small space in your diaper bag, and helps stimulate her senses.
B002QBDVAC|1|Very cute and if it worked, it would have been exactly what we needed... but the cheap construction caused it to tangle internally the first time we tried to use it. It was unfixable and we had to send it back. Ended up buying an old fashioned 4 digit combination extra long bicycle lock instead.
B001EQ66WK|5|My grandson loved it
B0031M9EHE|5|I love this bought it for my grandchild to play on when I was babysitting her. This keeps her looking around and pulling on the bird to play the music.
B001CW7CVK|5|Got this for my grandson who sleeps with it every night. He adores it. The construction is very sturdy and has stayed intact through several months so far.
B004IYFMCK|5|I bought this thinking we would use it for travel. We have yet to go anywhere (baby is five weeks, so will update when we do go somewhere!) but we have used this bassinet nearly everyday since we brought him home as a napper. It's great to just have him out in the living room while he is napping so that I can get things done with him right there. He sleeps really well in it. I bought the three sheet set to go with it.<br /><br />Pros: Great, portable, breathable bassinet to keep an eye on baby in different parts of the house.<br /><br />Cons: mattress is not waterproof and there are no bassinet pads available for the particular size. I folded a regular one in half and put it under the sheets to put under him so that he wouldn't wet through and get the mattress wet.<br /><br />I'm not sure about traveling with it as its big and bulky. We were given a Brica fold and go which fits in a suitcase. This may just end up being his day bed to sleep in the living room or home office while the fold and go will be the one we actually travel with.
B00B3G8UGQ|4|This keeps my child occupied for hours.  The iPad keeps them totally entranced.  It is like they have a diaper on already.  I can game on my Xbox or PC for hours while they use this next to my desk.  The downside is having to empty the thing out when I am ready to play with the child.  But that is much better than having to change a diaper.  In fact, my child begs to use this thing and loves toilets now.  It is difficult to have them use a toilet in public.  If I give him the iPad in the public restroom he will go.  Kind of hard to get out of the stall because he wants to keep using it.  I am docking one star because it only comes in children size.  I suggest they make one for adults...five stars then!<br /><br />Cons:  No adult size.  My son accidentally missed with the wipes and got the fecal matter on his hand.  Ooooops.  iPad was all his afterwards.  Feces in the crevasses is not covered under Apple's warranty.  Even the extended one.  I had to buy new one.  But my 2 year old is super excited for his own iPad.
B00D45QU4I|1|These are not safe to use! I know they are cute, but they are not worth the risk to a child. In an accident these can compress and the baby can be ejected from the car seat! They also interfere with how the harness is positioned on the baby's shoulders. Parent, please research the safety of aftermarket products before using them. Only use the harness covers that come with the car seat.
B004C43JJO|5|The best highchair!! Doesn't stain, cleans easily.  It's plenty big for a larger baby.  I love this highchair!! And it looks great too.
B000FGG8TG|5|These are great for on the go. Some reviewers had issue with the &#34;toss&#34; idea of them but I take it as if you accidentally lose something you don't feel badly and when something shows wear then just recycle it! I'm not so sure the name of the product has to be taken quite so literally. Would certainly purchase again but I don't think I will need to as there are a lot of pieces included in this set! Highly recommended for on the go snacking.
B00622Y2J0|5|I purchased this curtain valence to go with the crib bedding. It came as promised; I just had to work with ironing all the wrinkles out. After awhile I managed to get it looking great. I'd recommend this for purchase.
B0018Q08G6|5|This sweet little &#34;Lambie&#34; rattle is soft, safe, & absolutely adorable! : D  Small  & light-weight, just right for tiny hands to grasp, with muted rattle sound so it's not going to startle your &#34;Little Lambie&#34; awake. . . Must have in every Nursery: 5 stars
B002UXR530|5|Lots of pockets, plenty of room even for cloth prefolds, very nice looking, neutral enough that it doesn't look out of place on either myself or my husband, comfortable to carry. I was so excited when one randomly appeared at the end of my pregnancy because it was exactly what I wanted!
B00KWR2BCQ|5|Loved this pillow, so decided to buy another for my house for my grandson! He sleeps so much better with his pillow:)
B003K1CNB0|4|I like the trimness of this diaper, especially through the crotch. I'm not a fan of stuffing it, when sized for a smaller baby...it is difficult to get the insert in, as opposed to other brands and the perfect size FB diapers. It functions well and is easy to use.
B0000DEW8N|5|I was pleased that the seat raises up and that it has 3 trays. Very nice. I'd much rather have this one so our grandson can sit at the table with all of us instead of being in a bulky high chair. PLUS, you can take it to go! LOVE IT!
B00A2HUF9M|4|This car seat was given to my daughter as a gift for her first birthday. I was concerned that it would be too big to fit into my 98 Camry rear-facing- I should not have been concerned. The seat is wider than it is deep, so the passenger seat can be all the way back and the driver seat is about half-way and the car seat doesn't touch either. Now, the seat is wide. It is installed in the center seat of our car, and I tried to install our bucket (key fit 30) next to it, just to see. The base fits in fine, but the sat has to be jiggled in to snap together and the seats overlap a bit- not ideal. Though these two seats would probably fit if neither were installed in the center seat.    My car does not have the latch system, and this carseat was tricky and a pain to install with the seatbelt. First, the instruction manual is not explicit and seems to skip steps with adequate pictures to help along (especially when compared to the keyfit30, which instruction manual was easy to follow). I ended up finding a Britax YouTube video to fully understand. To use the seatbelt pathway, you have to remove the cover and in general, it is kind of a pain. Not difficult, just extra steps that were annoying to me. The seat of my car must also be sloped, as a regular sized noodle was not enough to get the carseat level. Perhaps a larger noodle size or towel would work better.    My one year old does not love the seat, and the hugs pads are going to take some getting used to. The \\"safe and click\\" technology does not get the harness tight enough, so ignore it and do the pinch test instead.    Also, the cover is \\"spot clean only\\" - what product for kids can't run through the wash? Here is hoping she doesn't get car sick. Otherwise, the fabric is a cute, bright print and feels very soft, plush, and comfortable.    We chose this car seat for the steel bar construction, overall high quality product, and extra safety features since we have an older car. I am happy with the carseat overall, especially since we don't move it between two cars, and it seems my grievances are mostly with the bells and whistles.    9/2014 UPDATE: I took this car to a CPST to have it checked after installing it ourselves with the help of the youtube video. If baby/child is rear-facing, they do not need to wear the HUGS pads. Huge help for my daughter who is a peanut, the straps have a tighter fit this way. She is now 30 months old and is still rear-facing. She weighs about 25 lbs and is 32\\" tall.     Washing: She did, indeed, get car sick while riding in her seat (and has, several times). What a pain to clean. I think every car seat is, but I did need to wash the cover instead of just \\"Spot cleaning\\" as recommended. Used HOT water on a regular cycle and let air dry and the cover looks great. It is tricky to get the brown part (Anna cover style) by her head clean because that fabric cannot be removed. It didn't get hit with any vomit, but it does get sticky or spotted over time. Spot cleaning is okay.     While it was a pain to learn to install, like many things, I can do it quite easily now. Was shown by CPST how to get it tightly installed with a seat belt without using a pool noodle. Great recline on the seat. We had a seatbelt lock-off clip break today, which was discouraging. For a seat this expensive, the seat is supposed to last. I guess the seat is still strong, just needs a replacement part. Car seat is warranted for one year, so the new clips are $5. Not ideal, but easily fixed.    My daughter is happy with her seat, she climbs in and out and know that to be safe her straps need to be tight. She loves the little pillows on the straps that keep her neck comfy. She falls asleep in the car seat frequently. Overall, 18 months later and still a happy customer. I recommend this seat to my friends.
B003XMWFBE|5|This is perfect! It can hold a lot and really helps with my 2 year old. She can reach what she wants in the first 2 rows so it's safer when I'm driving. I bought 2 of them and they have really been lifesavers. I put a lot of &#34;just in case&#34; things and they have really come in handy and aren't lost under the seats. Easy to put in, just a couple straps. Good quality and good price.
B004J1QNFW|3|So yea... I didn't buy this, my darling wife did after hearing other mothers ogle over the healing effects of fermented tree sap and how their teething bambino fuss less. Sure.. their babies fuss less due to these miracle beads that are quite possibly made of just good ole trusty polycarbonate (plastic).  Personally, I don't notice anything different about our bundle of joy. She isn't doing backflips or singing nursery rhymes or running for town mayor... Which would be pretty rad and encourage me to give this white collar scam 5 stars. Yup.. It's beads.. Let's chock this up to $20 less in her college fund that with interest could have maybe bought her a few pizzas and brews when she turns 21 and hits the bar to celebrate.
B00192FN7I|3|the swing serves as a good place to keep the baby entertained while you are doing other things around the house.  my baby is two months old now.  the only problem i have is that now the music part of the swing is broke.  it sounds like a broken record.  plays for a few seconds then starts over and keeps doing that like a broken record.  i dont think the baby notices the difference tho.  im just glad i got it as a shower gift and didnt pay for it myself or i would be a little mad about it.
B001ECRSXK|3|This was a gift, and after installing it, we quickly became hooked.  It is so nice to be able to have our little one at the counter while we do kitchen stuff.  It feels solid for us, and comfortable for her.  It has back support, and she doesn't climb out of it too easily.  However, there are some limitations.  Babies make a mess, so we have to clean it.  Fortunately, the well constructed denier nylon slips off for cleaning, which is great!  but the problem is the removal of the chair from the counter.  The installation to the counter is very simple (although it takes some effort to get it snug...i imagine this snugging process is what causes it to be so hard for us to remove).  Once this chair is on, one of the legs comes off as intended...just press in the red large button (not easy, but doable), and the gripping arm falls free.  But the other side is brutally hard. I'm a big, strong guy...250#...and I usually end up resorting to tools of some sort (sometimes wishing for a sledge hammer!).  I wonder if our counter thickness is just between the ratchet sizes?  I dunno, but we dreaded taking it off.    Recently we've replaced our counter top, and the new one doesn't have quite as long and overhang.  As a result, we can't use this chair at all anymore.  the bottom brackets require like 9\\".  This has been a problem on a few tables and counters when we travel with this too.    we're now looking for the same feature set, but with a different design (easier to remove, and shallower depth required).  Phil & Ted's doesn't come apart to clean, but we may try that next.
B001F6NJQA|5|This is the second one we have purchased. The first for my daughter, and the second for my nephew because we love it so much.
B000LSL5ZK|5|Very good!
B00L3F20U4|5|I love this warmer!!! It works great with cloth or disposable wipes.
B00RU3DN18|5|Amazing ! Thanks for this product
B00B561YLC|5|This bag is very functional and cute!  I love the design... it has lots of pockets and stores everything easily.
B00L2FPBXS|1|Nothing but a simple piece of plastic. Don't waste your money.
B000L9JOIO|5|I found our original \\"Mr. Froggie\\" at a hospital gift shop when our daughter was 4 months old.  This is one of the best loveys out there.  Since there is no rattle in it, it did not wake her up when ever she moved like her other loveys, and it is incredibly soft.  The blanket part washes beautifully in the washer (gentle) and dryer but the head and arms can become worn & thread bare - definitely recommend laying this out to dry when ever possible.  That being said, I still give it a 5 just for the sheer amount of joy this still brings to her at almost 2.5 years.  I am purchasing a 2nd one as a spare when one is in need of a bath.
B001VEJ2GC|5|This changing pad cover fits great on the summer infant contoured changing pad I bought here on Amazon. I was surprised at how soft this changing pad cover turned out to be. I'm really liking the look and feel of it. I did get this in white which I know once baby is here I'll have to protect the white cover with a blanket or something because I didn't think ahead on the white color. But that was definitely my mistake. Still happy with my purchase.
B00009Q6G6|5|This little co-sleeper is worth every penny.  You have to order it online, but we had no trouble doing so.  It is very nice to be able to put the sleeper anywhere at any time (living room, bedroom, family room, etc...).  At night, we put it next to our bed.  It is SO nice to have our daughter right next to us during the night.  The co-sleeper is perfect for the first few months before your baby moves on into his/her crib.  I feel it is much more useful than a bassinet and is made much better than a lot of the plastic bassinets.  I would recommend this product to every parent!
B000BNQC58|5|I have loved the twilight turtle since before my son was born. It was so calming.  I was sure my child would love it too once he arrived and I was absolutely right.  During the newborn stage, it was fantastic for seeing my way around without overly stimulating or waking the baby.  By 6 months, my son was fascinated by the lights on the ceiling.  Even now at 18 months, we use it every night as part of our bedtime ritual and a fit is thrown if I forget.  The three different colored lights are great because each is of a different brightness level.  The buttons to turn it on or change color are large enough to find in the dark with ease.  I truly cannot say enough good things about this product and think it is a must have for all new parents/babies.
B0091537C8|5|Perfect for my baby's pink room. It is very soft and cozy. I haven't found many baby blankets that I really like but this one is wonderful! It washed up and dried beautifully. I'm sure she will like it as much as I do.
B0080RVYXW|2|The picture on the website made this tree appear to be much larger. I was disappointed in the small size of it. It is cute but small.
B00FAXOKR6|1|I bought this thinking it would help my son sit ashe always wanted to sit but it just aaggravated both of us because it was very slippery he kept sliding
B0057XXTAI|3|Only gave 3 stars...because I didn't get the pink...I got the one with dots, which will work...but preferred what I ordered!<br />Fast ship/ Thanks!
B004AGOQQY|5|Exactly as described and a lovely soft snuggle toy
B0085DJ71M|2|I purchased these as well as some of the original muslin ones. I much prefer the muslin for swaddling since my daughter can wiggle out of these within seconds. Also as a first time mom I methodically washed everything before her arrival. They came out of the wash ( brand new washer mind you) with small tears, hanging strings and looking well worn. My daughter was born soon after so I just got around to contacting a+a and they are sending me a replacement. Hopefully the new set will be better quality.
B0081C9UO6|5|love it. Prefect size, sometimes we use it for snacks too.
B002FQKB2Y|5|This worked so good in my child's room that I ordered another one!  The toy chain is a nice addition and there are alot of clips in there.  I didn't really have room to hang the second chain so we just used the clips on the first one we got.  It is so nice to have all the stuffed animals off the floor!
B00DQL6CIE|2|Positives: Slim design for good fit in diaper bag. Sturdy and well-made.<br /><br />Negative: The purpose of having this is to have moist wipes in your diaper bag and the WIPES DRY OUT in this dispenser. They need to revise the design with a rubber gasket around the openings. When on-the-go, and your baby is naked on a public restroom changing table, the last thing you need is to open your wipes and see that they're all dried out. I suppose if you use them very often and replace frequently you wouldn't mind this.
B0040GJ0UG|5|Excellent product. My 9 months old daughter loves to play with this toy.
B004N25EFW|1|Just so everyone knows, you need the explora easy-mat if you want to try using the suction feature of this product. Also, Target sells these exact plates for $6 (I bought mine yesterday on sale for $5).<br /><br />I bought these plates in green the Tommee Tippee easy-mat because my 9 month old enjoys feeding himself, but has a hard time picking food up from his high chair tray (too slippery and the food slides around). I opened them and tested them out as soon as I got home. I was impressed that after putting the mat on the tray, and then the plate onto the suction cup on the mat that I could lift the entire tray only by holding the plate. I thought this system was powerful and would be perfect for my son.<br /><br />So, for my son's next meal I set up the plate in front of him while I heated up his food in the kitchen. I was gone for maybe 30 seconds and my son already had the plate free. I thought maybe I didn't suction it very well, so I put the plate back in place, tested it, walked away while keeping an eye on him and sure enough, he had the plate free again in less than 30 seconds. So, I tried again, this time adding a little moisture to the suction. That helped a little, but literally a minute later my son had it free again.<br /><br />I still had not given up yet though. I tried using the system again this morning... same thing happened. My husband even tried and our son had the plate free in 30 seconds. I'd really like to know how the other reviewers don't have this problem. My son can't get the mat off the high chair tray, it's just the plate that he can remove. I feel like I've wasted 11 bucks now. I'm sorry, but I like to use the things I purchase, even if it wasn't expensive.<br /><br />This was a great idea, but does not work. If you're going to try it, purchase from Target though.
B00L8DIEW4|1|Got caraeat for my 6 month 96% percent in height and 75 and weight. I can't keep her head from falling forward. I regret the purchase and will not purchase this for my second or third vehicle. I would rather buy multiple car seats as she grows than have her unsafe and uncomfortable for any amount of time. Just not worth it
B00GFQY5CC|5|Such a great idea to reuse powdered baby formula container.  My grandson loves it.
B001UF8BL4|4|Grandbaby liked it. I thought it would be larger.
B00F2MQ5SM|5|THIS IS GREAT FOR WHEN YOU TODDLER HAS OUTGROWN THEIR POTTY TRAINING POT.  I ALSO GOT THE STEPPING STOOL TO MATCH.
B0031AO1OW|5|Good quality.  I built it by myself a little hard but with patience can be done :).  It comes with all the tools necessary. Maybe just a screwdriver is all that I needed.
B003I7ITS2|5|I looked into a lot of car seats before I made this purchase. I had the graco snap an go and it was flimsy and not stable at all. The recaro is large, but I have a 2012 honda accord ex-l and it fits perfect. It was a little difficult to install but it just made the security much better if I push on it, it won't tip. It's Comfy my baby absolutely loves it.
B000YDDF6O|5|It was a gift to granddaughter and her mother says she plays with it often ..she plays with it often
B002L3T9VA|2|The spiral end did not move, broken
B009Z4V6G4|5|Very impressed with the quality and make. Seems like it will be very warm for baby in the winter months
B0014KUGNQ|5|I love this.  It makes it so much easier to sleep in another room.  It has had a few false alarms when the baby moved into a corner of the crib, but that actually makes me feel better.  It works!
B0030UUBMO|5|These fit in my porta cribs really good for my grand children.  I just wanted something besides the piece of cardboard they come with.  They worked great
B003VNKLIY|4|Great product to fence a VERY LARGE opening so long as it is not a high traffic area-- the gate is narrow (about 18 inches) and the baby-safe latch is difficult to operate with one hand (i.e. with baby in arms).  We needed a very large gate to cover an opening that was over six feet wide off our living room.  We originally purchased this item to put there, but once we installed it, we realized that it would be irritating to wrestle with the latch and turn sideway(ish) to go through the narrow gate several times a day with a baby in hand.  So we placed this super wide gate across one end of the entire room (about 10 feet) to block off the TV/the blinds/and eventually the Christmas tree.  Since we are not using the gate every day, it works perfectly.  And the fact that we didn't need to purchase multiple panels to do this was awesome. The gate is also easily adjustable while installed--just loosen the joints to readjust the configuration, and is easy to remove when needed.  For example, at Christmas, we adjusted configuration to accommodate the large tree behind the fence, the day of we removed the fence to open presents, and after we took the tree down, we reconfigured yet again to have more room to play.  For the price, you can't beat it.<br /><br />The Pros:  A very wide gate for a reasonable price--no need to buy pricey extension panels<br />  Easy to reconfigure while still installed, just loosen the joints and you can bend the panels in or out<br />  Easy to remove panels/gate if needed<br />The Cons:  Not very useful in high traffic areas<br />  Gate is very narrow<br />  Really need two hand to operate latching system<br /><br />Note: For our high traffic opening, we purchased a KidCO gate with one extension panel which cost much more.  But the gate is very large, the latch can be opened with one hand, it is self-closing, yet it will stay open if you open it 90 degrees which is nice for the evenings.  While I think my husband had more trouble installing the KidCO one, it works better for the high traffic area because of the gate/latch.
B003H4QFRS|3|I drooled over this review over and over, but upon comparing it side by side with the new Baby Trend Ultra Sit and Stand the latter was the fave. What it boils down to is with the carseat on the front of the joovy the back child CANNOT sit down without hunching and this was a deal breaker for me. It did seem to work just fine with my two year old up front and a 3 year old nephew in the back but if you have a baby and a child who wants to sit this is not the stroller for you. The Babytrend Ultra allows the carseat on the back and the toddler can sit up front and this works sooo much better for me. Hope this helps :)
B004N3C2YM|5|Easy to use and held everything in like it needed to
B009UPUC36|4|great soft light. The button is very small and hard to find in the dark (on the bottom). But my kids seem to find it ok (2 and 4 years old). Even the baby loves it!
B006I0R0XQ|4|Easy to use. Fits steadily on toilet seat. Easy to clean.
B004ECJWK4|5|Works great when you don't want air flow cut off to your rooms
B000G6BZJI|4|very flimsy but does the trick my little four legged rugrat is kept at bay when needed.;-)
B000AKB4IM|5|poor kids gong to look like a redneck...wait i live in redneck heavin so nothing wrong with that.lol
B00AO083KU|1|$140 and 3 months later this stupid swing stopped working! On the hugest setting it only glides maybe half an inch in either direction and if my son moves at all the motor will stop the motion and attempt to start again but still barely move. What a waste!!!
B001CFACMI|5|Comes in handy, so that the shower head is within reach for my elderly mother.  Holds really tight to shower wall.
1586637304|5|Our baby loves this book & has loved it for a while now ... He enjoys when I read it to him, and enjoys playing with it on his own.
B001UF8BL4|5|I usually write descriptive reviews but i bought this for other peoples kids, so i can't add any real value other than it looks like the picture and I assume they like it.
B000GB0O0O|3|I bought this item for my godson who loves music.  I first put it on his playpen and he was really happy with it.  The only problem was when I tried to attach it to the crib I found that the straps were too short.  The crib has a 2-3 inch ledge at the very top.  I contacted Munchkin customer service and although they responded quickly, they were not very helpful at all.  In fact, I was told to go and get longer straps:(  Seems like it needs to be more versatile to fit wider cribs.  Also, I am a little concerned that a very active baby could get to the mp3 player on the other side (not very secure).  overall, a great concept.  I would love to see an updated version to address these concerns.
B00BP1HIOY|5|They work great for us. I like the glass. The nipple it came with is kind of fast flow, which works for my daughter...she goes back and forth between breast and this bottle just fine.
B004A910UG|5|I was nervous on buying a stroller in the mid price range when everyone kept telling me just to get an inexpensive umbrellas stroller. But I went ahead and bought the stroller with the second seat (to be ready when it's time for kid #2) any way... BEST PURCHASE EVER!     It fits perfect with my black Maxi Cosi car seat. It's so easy to open and close. It fits into the back of my Prius excellently and doesn't take up too much room. I just drive around with it in my trunk all day. You can steer the stroller with one hand and the bottom mesh holder fits my diaper bag and so much more. I absolutely love this stroller and it is a show stopper. Everyone always asks about it and where we got it. And that's not even with the second seat attached yet. That's when it get impressive.    The only cons are that each piece is sold separate. Some days it would be nice to have a drink holder or a place to put keys or toys. But that's ok. It's been my choice not the purchase those yet.     Overall, love this stroller. Won't hesitate again about purchasing one.
B006XD4P8Q|4|My daughter was pleased with the gift. That is my gauge for success of a gift, or not. Thank you.
B00L0E0T4W|3|These are REALLY CUTE the only PROBLEM is i wish they where all the same size as they were supposed too :\ but still Very CUTE /Purple is my Favorite color and was the smallest set in the Company never said that size's may vary :\
B0047O3Y2G|5|I was in a car wreck and the Insurance replace my car seats. I wanted the best. So I purchased the Britax SGL Booster. I am very happy with my choose. I feel my granddaughter will be very safe. I purchased it from Amazon. It was here in a couple of days. Very happy with everything.
B001OHVHJQ|5|I have 2 babies and 2 exersaucers.  This toy is the very first thing they alway grab.  They love the fish. My toddlers also go over and grab it quite often.  A very worthwhile toy.
B005O8IQNQ|5|I gave this ornament a five star because it is not easy finding a 1st grandma Christmas ornament that is cute and classy. I recommend this to all the grandparents or as a gift.
B00OZVUOEM|5|So soft and cute
B00BZAQ0S0|4|Cords were a little too long but my Grandson likes it.
B001O7ESYW|1|I bought these to use as burp cloths.  They felt really thin and almost see through when I took them out of the package, but I thought I would keep them anyway.  So, I washed them and dried them.  When I pulled them out of the dryer, they were all wrinkled and shrunk quite a bit.  Don't waste your money on these for any purpose.
B00EPZXQIE|3|It's not very sturdy, doesn't stay in place all that well, almost impossible to use on a &#34;home&#34; toilet seat. It does however, get the job done on a public potty. My 3 year old daughter doesn't want to use a public potty without it.
B003VTZKOI|1|I had this product 2 hours and the leg snapped. My baby rolled forward and hit his head. It is now in the trash!!
B003SX0B8C|5|I bought the snuggin go too a couple of years ago when my daughter was just about 3.  She will be 6 this October.  She is unable to sit up by herself at all and can not keep her head in a center position and I was looking for something to use to help her get some support without having to be laying fully reclined or flat.  She has severe disabilities.  I would have to make my own system with rolls, pillows, blankets - whatever to keep her in alignment or use a big bulky piece of equipment with a zillion built in supports that are not the most comfortable - more like a restraint system. This is perfect.  I can lift her without having my own adaptations falling all over the place and get her back in her seat easily without having to reassemble it all.  It is very light too - no weight or bulk to it.  She is small for her age so it still works for us and will for probably another year.  Hoping they will create a bigger size so we can continue to use \\"normal\\" equipment and just add this in for comfortable support.  I have not used her wheelchair stroller very much at all which makes it really nice to maneuver in public where things are sometimes cramped and awkward.  I am putting this to its full use - if not exceeding what it says it can do and it is doing it.
B00F1CPBQ0|5|My baby Loves it!!!
B007A2ZSZ8|5|Very strong latch. Hoping it comes off easilt but I haven't tried to remove yet.
B0088UXLSW|5|Perfect thay went to Canada and it was very useful , and my grand daughter just loved it. No more reviews for me.  Your rules are ridiculous
B00AM5NTIS|5|Very satisfied with this product! Allows me to be on-the-go with my son with my homemade food without bringing loads of plastic bags, spoons and tupperware.  So happy I found this product and have already recommended it to other Mommys.
B003CK3LDI|5|Wubbanubs are a gift for new parents! They are awesome and don't roll off the baby's chest. We purchase this for all of our friends who have newborns.My only con would be that you can't replace the soothie that's on the end. If our dogs got to them and ruined the pacifier we'd have to buy a whole new wubbanub.
B000FFL58Q|4|Ordered for my 9 week old grandson.  Easy to assemble and store.  He loves it and will be an activity center for him for months.
B005VLXIS4|1|Worst purchase ever, my baby is 12 weeks old and average size does not support her so I have to hold her up with one hand while I clean her with the other! Will be returned!!
B0007WHCZC|5|I love this Item.  It was a life saver.  At around 4-6 weeks, my baby would only sleep if held or laying on his side next to me after breastfeeding.  Since it's impossible to hold a baby all night and laying next to me on his side was a \\"No, No\\" for SIDS, I was looking for something that could help me get him to sleep in his bassinet on his back as is suggested to prevent SIDS.  I had tried swaddling my baby in blankets, but after a few weeks he had figured out how to get out of it.  I also didn't like that he could undo the blanket and it was loose around his face, another \\"no, no\\" for SIDS. So I bought these swaddle Me blankets that fasten easily with velcro.  And shortly after we started using the Swaddle me's, he started sleeping through the night, occasionally waking up for a 15 minute feeding (which I keep him swaddled for) and then he falls right back to sleep and I carefully pick him up and put him back in the bassinett for the rest of the night.  He's 4 months old now and we're still using them.... Buy a few, because if we wets himself, which boys do a lot, you'll need another one to switch him into.
B004XIRSU0|5|Great Seat!  Kids seem very comfortable in it and easy for them to even buckle themselves in!
B00LWRHF0S|5|I love this bag!
B00IZUJGTS|5|Our 4 month old loves this- he thinks he's grown.  It's very cute and he can back up in it but hasn't quite got the going forward movement yet.  We have hardwoods so it rolls smoothly.  I don't think it would roll over carpet very well.
B00BJRBNCM|2|The recline on the seat is awful. I have to place a towel behind her. It was easy to assemble.
B003ULP59M|3|This item is a little bigger than what we were expecting so it takes up a lot of space.  Some of the compartments are not really user friendly either.  We will use it for now, but due to size we may hunt for a smaller one.
B00F0N7TG0|5|We love it and it fits nice. I was too nervous to get my son a necklace due to possibility of choking, this is a great compromise.
B00HTYFS0W|4|We bought this as a smaller lighter stroller for vacations. It was easy to put together and so far its held up well after 2 trips with flights. The wheels are a bit squeaky now, but I will oil them. No much in the realm of suspension, so definitely transfers the sidewalk bumps to the stroller. The main usefulness is with the reversibility and the ability to fully recline with legs supported (out 8 month old infant could lie down almost flat). The canopy is large and has better shade than our other more expensive stroller. Would highly recommend the carrying bag, as it fits the stroller like a glove and makes flights very easy.
B000J6CDY6|3|I love the idea of this product, but I'm very disappointed that it does not have the heartbeat sound the full-sized model has.  I will probably be returning it for that reason.
B0018Z06P0|4|I ordered this product for my 3 month old, I didn't want to be worrying all summer about disposable swim diaper as we have a boat and will be in and out of water a lot.........so far we are very how with this swim diaper.  It really holds the waist in my son is pretty skinny and I'm very happy with how tight the leg closures and how snug the waist fits.  Would highly recommend this reusable diaper. We bought an extra to have two to rotate through when one gets messed.
B004V8VQEG|3|Bright colors and very cute but not much for baby to do.  It makes music when you pull the penguin and has the beads up top but that is it.  My son loved it for a few days and hasn't touched it since.
B00006S3RX|5|This is a grear buy! I read a lot of the other reviews and started to get concerned about the toys (i.e., the hard edges on the castle, the hard edges on the jester, etc.) but i went with it anyway once i saw it in the store. <br /> <br />Evenflo must have changed it because everything on the one I bought has rounded edges and looks quite safe. It really wasn't too bad to put together either - about 25 minutes. <br /> <br />I have a 4 month old who was starting to try and sit up herself, but this has really helped her since she is gaining muscle control and strength by sitting in it. I also work from home and she loves to be in it!  <br /> <br />I am probably only one of a few people who wishes that the music on it was louder as i think it is a little too soft. <br /> <br />She was a lottle overwhelmed at first by the selection of toys on it, but a few days of sitting in it and she loves to play with all of them now!
B00DAB981S|1|Took us a while to install but it didn't fit and doesn't stay on rim
B002SZH45E|5|Amazing!!! When my baby has a stuffing nose or phase blockage from big dried boogers I take this out and suck them right out!! Wish I had this with my first two kids. Excellent purchase!!!
B00494IS4S|4|I like these bottles, but they still leak a little bit sometimes.  They are not 100% leak proof.  I had the older Avent bottles from our first child.  We tried to re-use our older bottles (only 3 yrs old), but we had issues to say the least.  These newer Avent bottles are nicer, and do leak less.
B0000AY9XY|1|I have a newborn who is 2 weeks old. After noticing feeding after feeding that the milk was coming out entirely too much from his mouth and making a huge mess. I decided to try the Playtex Nurser System. The Playtex bottles are so much better. <BR>These Avent bottles not only leaked from the caps like everyone complains about...but the milk would leak from my baby's mouth. <BR>I called Avent, and the rep said that its because the baby's lips have to be outward doing a &quot;suckling&quot; effect....WHO HAS TIME TO BE FUSSING WITH A NEWBORN TO SEE IF HIS MOUTH IS SUCKING CORRECTLY??  <BR>In my opinion its a shame, cause I bought everything Avent,,and alot of bottles as well, and I was really excited about using the bottles.
B00JFUN77E|5|I do not think our grandson will ever tire of playing with this toy!  He LOVES it!
B00C2KW3FG|5|We have this sleeper and it has been god sent. Our baby sleeps in it most of the time. He loves the snug fit. It's also the perfect height for co sleeping.  Would recommend this to anyone,
B004OR1DXI|5|Bought this for the ridiculous amount of stuffed animals that were covering our child's bed. Such a great buy! We love it!
B0009RG8R8|1|I had purchased two of these in order to make a free standing area in our living room for our first baby. Being a first time parent, it is difficult to know what the sound investments will be and this one left me very disappointed and wishing for my $200 back. First, when I put my son inside the area, he was able to stand up and pull on one side and walk it in until the entire structure became unstable and fell over? Thus, we stopped using it until the giant monstrosity consuming our living room became unbearable & I decided To try and salvage the structure by affixing iit to the walls- even though I did not want to drill into the walls in the first place. Only thing was I no longer had the hole template and there were no measurements in the instruction manual to tell you where to measure out the holes. I called costumer service and after a 15 minute wait, was told that they had no template and had no measurements to give me. Being a busy working mom, that even writing this review was a stretch, had no idea this product would take so much time to try to salvage. I would not waste your time or hard earned money on this one, so beware!
B000G6BZJI|5|Great Product, good price and fast shipper.
B0043D28B4|5|My nephew loves this!
B000A88KC2|5|I tried every other size of breast shield, all of them too small then found these XL sized ones and they work great!
B00067AUNY|2|Bear does not shut off after 40 min like its suppose to and even on the lowest setting the fuzzy heart beat sound it makes is very loud. Gave it 2 stars only because a little constant noise helps my son go into deeper sleep as long as I turn the bear off as soon as he does or else it wakes him up.
B002LARFQY|5|great cloths
B003U3TWJO|5|I love this brand and every poridge that they have! My baby is a picking eater but he eats it with a pleasure.
B000LBISES|3|Super Fast/easy assembly which is great! Aestetically, it is great! I have four major complaints however...    1. The space between my child and the tray is fairly significant. My son is in the 98th percentile for his age (5 months) and weighs 22lbs...even with his cute belly popping out, there is more than enough room for him to lose his food before he even reaches his mouth. I can't imagine how frustrating this would be if he were any smaller!     2. The seat that sits on the table (when put in highchair position)simply just sits on a slot. No bolts, No locking mechanisms. There is some sort of \\"mechanism\\" that makes a sound when you push the seat into place, but it doesn't actually do anything constructive. My issue with this is pure safety. My son hasn't thrown a temper in the seat yet, but if he did and rocked himself back and forth I wouldn't be surprised if he rocked the seat right off the base!    3. I read other reviews about the bolts becoming lose. I haven't had that trouble YET...but I have to say the bolts suck, simply put. Using a coin to sucure them into place is just silly. I didn't like that feature.    4. The tray...aside from being far away from my son, it's a pain to actually put into place. Everything has to line up just so. It's like a balancing act everytime I put it on...and that's on a good day when my son isn't trying to wack the tray as I'm trying to do so.     As a personal table and chair set it is GREAT! My niece used it as her table & chair at our holiday party and loved it. So in that regard I would give it 4/5 stars...as a highchair it does have a few flaws however.
B006WMO4Q6|5|Very cool! These provide the necessary &#34;nubs&#34; to ease sore gums while baby is teething. The pacifier concept is a good one as well.
B000067K0L|5|The day after we brought the baby home, I put her on this mat and she was in awe of the blinking lights and music.  It gave me 20 minutes to shower and get dressed.  There was no other place to put the baby while I was alone with her without her fussing.  Mat worked its magic every time!  As soon as she was on it, I knew she would be happy.  She used this mat continuously until six months of age.  I got LOTS of gifts for my shower and this is one of the top 3.  (Fisher Price Kick and Play bouncer was also a HUGE help, as were Einstein Videos.) <br /> <br />
B004E2XOBM|4|Nice toy, perfect size for small hands. Though my baby still uses it more as a rattle than as a roller.
B006ZSYGOW|5|Great blankets that are light and large. Great for swaddling and for breast feeding in public. The white color is vivid and washes nicely and will be perfect for warmer weather as a light blanket.
B00AZZWNAU|4|Love love love this! I just wish the wipes were more easily accessible and allowed a thick new package. We use wipes for everything.
B004FKGVRW|3|The chair was way to small for my petite 5 year old.  We gave it to my one year old niece. The umbrella also leaned even after tightening the screws.
B002M77N22|5|My husband and I were lent this by a friend when we had our son. This is a definate must for any parent (whether a new parent or not).  We loved this so much that when the time came to return it, I immediatly went online and ordered it. My son spent alot of time sleeping and just hanging out in this.  It is easily portable and is perfect if you have an event to go to and can't use something big like the pack and play.  We brought this to restuarants for family events and was perfect.  People kept commenting on how wonderful it was and had never seen anything like it. He was able to hang out in it  and take a nap while we ate.  This is also good for when yoru baby is teething as he/she is able to sleep and being somewhat elevated.  There's no concern about their spine being curved or anything.  As you can see from the picture the back is completely straight.  My son is nearly a year old now and is too big to sleep in it,  but I still let him hang out in it(strapped in of course) while he watches mickey or ice age while drinking his bottle or just vegging.
B000056OWC|2|Very difficult to use and I have three children. Baby constantly (even with a towel) slips down and does not feel secure.  Does no fit in our standard sink correctly. I gave it a second chance and no better.
B000IYYEJ6|5|Bought this seat for my 5 yo, to replace 5-point Britax model as she is now over 40 lbs.  The comfort is terrific and she can now buckle herself - yeah!!  It feels much more sturdy and comfortable (so she says) than her friends' boosters, particularly with the head \\"wings\\".  Bought this same model 3 years ago for her older brother and his is holding up beautifully.  Head height adjustment is so easy and secure too - great for when giving her friends a ride home.    My only complaint would be that the fold-out cup holders are too shallow (had a few drinks tip over that were placed in them).  Not a big problem for us as our new car has built-in cup holders (as most cars do these days).  All in all, a great buy!
B000067EH7|5|This tub has worked great for my son since he was a newborn.  We're still using it 5 months later.  Your baby can grow with this tub.  The way the tub contours with the baby's body is great.  I never felt my baby can slip or be harmed by the tub (of course, I never leave my sight from him when he's in the tub).  I've used another tub while visiting in-laws and didn't like it as much.  So far, this is the best tub for us.
B00KFLZDQ0|2|We have had a couple of these for a while and I always run my sippy cups and lids through the dishwasher and make sure they are dried well. My husband accidentally popped the mouthpiece off and we found a bunch of mold growing underneath where you couldn't see and wouldn't think to disassemble to wash. We will be throwing these out. Too many small pieces to undo to clean thoroughly.
B000IAJWPG|5|After reading a lot of reviews on this dresser we decided to take a gamble. With a newborn on the way we wanted to get something practical, nice, yet affordable. After visiting 3 furniture stores where a dresser cost between 500 and 800 I figured if I had to buy 2 of these I was ahead. After receiving the dresser and assembling we found it to be nice. They do use lighter weight wood and the user guide is not the easiest to read. It only 250 bucks. It is also the perfect height got a changing table if you are taller than 5 eight.<br /><br />If I had to change something it would be the labels on the pieces.
B001COPE86|5|my wife & i spent a lot of time researching different baby monitors & are extremely happy w/ this one.  very clear sound & easy to use.  both my wife & i are deep sleepers so if the sound doesnt wake us up the flashing lights do.  unit has good range as we found ourselves working outside on more than one occasion while she slept.
B00AJVLLQ2|5|I love this plates, feeding time is much more fun now! My baby loves looking at the animals in the plates and saying the name!!
B0030IICWC|5|Great gate! Super easy to install, great look and does it job. I actually installed it at the bottom of the stairs.<br />Very happy with my purchase.
B00B4JKJDO|5|My son loves this blanket! It's perfect for nap time at daycare! It's super soft. The picture is exactly what it looks like.
B0048JJX9S|1|My baby is breastfed but I've had to use bottles to supplement with pumped breastmilk to ensure that she is topped off during her feedings.  I also will be going back to work in 2 weeks, so I've been giving her more bottles rather than nursing directly from the breast.  We have been using Dr. Brown's Standard Neck bottles, and have been really happy with them.  However, since the increase in frequency of bottle use, I've been noticing that my baby's latch hasn't been that great, and her suckling motions at the breast have become lazy.  I registered for the Standard Neck not really understanding the difference back then.... but now I know that a major difference between the wide neck and standard neck is that WN encourages proper latch for bf babies.<br /><br />I researched these natural flow, wide nipple bottles and purchased Tommee Tippee from our local baby store, thinking maybe this will help my baby re-learn a proper latch.  We got these bottles last night and they will be going back to the store tomorrow.  They look cool, sure, but I personally found the shape a bit awkward to handle.  The box came with 3 bottles, and the nipple flow among the 3 nipples differed by a great deal.  The first one we tried was slow, and the other 2 were very fast even though all 3 are marked as Level 1. The manufacturing seemed inconsistent.  These sensitive tummy bottles claim to reduce gas, fussiness and spit-ups, but we used a bottle before bed last night and my baby had a VERY fussy night.  Granted this can be attributed to many other things, but she hasn't really had one in a while and the only thing different in the routine was the bottle used for the feeding.  The final deal breaker was that on BOTH of the next 2 feedings, my baby spat up a LOT... some went on my husbands shoulder, and a bunch on the floor both times. She rarely ever spits up on the Dr. Brown's bottles.<br /><br />Anyway, I guess I will be exchanging this for the Dr. Brown's Wide Neck Bottles.  We'll see how that works out...<br /><br />***Update almost 6 months later (July 25, 2012)****<br />Did return this product and did purchase Dr. Brown's Wide Neck.  What a difference!  Daughter rarely ever spat up, if at all.  Now, she's 8 1/2 months old and I'm still successfully breast-feeding/pumping milk since we were able to resolve her poor latch/ lazy suckle issues early on.  She started sleeping through the night before 3 months, gas issues were minimal, and started holding her bottle on her own at a little over 4 months.  Now I really wish I had just registered for the Dr. Brown's Wide Neck to begin with, but oh well... live and learn.that works out...<br /><br />***Update almost 6 months later (July 25, 2012)****<br />Did return this product and did purchase Dr. Brown's Wide Neck.

B005JCPKTK|4|- We did a lot of research before picking this stroller finally, bought it on Amazon, they had a good deal and it came quickly, plus they had the red one available. This stroller is very good, very strong, and a better version of the baby jogger in some ways. But I do not remember all those reasons except two: (1) the seat bottom and back is a good material and firm (2) there is a lock when you close the stroller which keeps it from opening in the car (but I didn't care much for this feature)<br /><br /> Overall PROS:<br />- good safe car seat, baby is comfortable in it<br />- car seat belt is comfortable and looks strong, has shoulder pads and a pad for the part that comes between the legs<br />- love the red color, you can't miss it on the street, higher visibility, thus cars will stop for you always.<br />- it has a nice tire lock controlled by one foot<br />- has a very good canopy<br />- has a simple system o click on car seat to stroller<br />- has a nice roomy storage space under stroller that is accessible easily<br />- does not tip over with my heavy bag on the handles when car seat is on the stroller (with or without baby in it)<br />- easy assembly<br />- good material, water resistant feel<br />- wheels work great on grassy terrain, or gravel<br /><br /> Overall CONS:<br />- car seat belt twists easily<br />- car seat seems to be a little difficult to take off the base sometimes, which is very annoying, I have to do a few tries lifting hard on the lever<br />- it is a little struggle to open the stoller with the lock, it is annoying, but after a few tries you figure out which side is the right side to stand on<br />- closing the stroller is very convenient, except one button you have to press, eventually you figure out which side of the stroller to stand on to make it quicker.<br />- Be careful with the mechanism it did get my husbands fingernail really bad... dunno how it happened, but it was the stroller.<br />- needs a cup holder
B001JHSTS8|1|don't stay on for larger boobs. suction doesn't hold, and if you wear them under a shirt they just flip off after a few minutes
B0000YWTRS|5|I love this product. This product made breastfeeding more comfortable. I also use this boppy to give my baby tummy time and she loves it. I do recommend purchasing slipcovers to keep some stains off your boppy.
B0000DEW8N|5|This is truly the perfect booster  seat for my visiting grandchildren. We just attach it to the kitchen chair and it works perfectly. We can also take to restaurants or when visiting family in the area.  This item is exactly as described, easy to clean, and very good quality. Add a blanket in back of smaller babies who can sit up and adjust as they grow, or remove the tray altogether and just push the chair up to the table for toddlers.
B007UFW13M|5|My toddler loves this doll stroller, she puts just about anything she can in it and wheels it around the house. I got it for her when she was about 16 months old, 8 months later and she still plays a lot with it. I also like that it folds up like a real stroller so it's easier to tuck out of the way if you want.
B004J34TDS|5|I wanted to start my baby on formula + cereal at nite. I was using the playtext ventaire bottles with fast nipples but even one scoop of cereal would clog the bottle. Finally I found the Dr. Browns Y cut nipples online and they are perfect. They fit in the playtext ventaire bottles and the cereal does not clog the nipples anymore.
B00OPVMZQW|5|Cute, fast shipping.
B00CJ2OWUG|4|I am very happy with these diapers, I have a set of the &#34;name brand&#34; ones and these work almost as well. Great to way to pad your diaper collection.
B001LENCUE|5|Amazing ! Another Dr. Brown favorite.
B00JBYNKWG|3|Had to return it because it didn't fit into any of the sinks in my house. Bummer!
B008MAIHBO|5|My 22 month old daughter loves this book. She likes the bright illustrations and especially the owl. I would recommend this book for infants to beginning readers.
B002WGI5W0|2|We are very disappointed with these bottles as we expected much higher quality.  The paint chipped & faded very quickly.  Some of the bottle/lid combinations don't work together as the bottom of the lid will hit the bottle rim before it's tight enough to form a seal.
B001F6XWT4|4|The Funky Zebra Musical Baby Girl Crib Mobile was added to enhance the 9 piece bedding set also purchased. The item was packaged neatly in a box and easy to put together. I am glad I purchased it    Jenny
B002LZEJ9A|5|I love these bowls! They are shallow, so be aware of that. However, they are perfect for my two year old.  They don't slid on the table and they are a great size for a toddler.  My daughter has mastered picking them up and drinking the left over milk out of them after her cereal. These are pliable, which may be a drawback for some people, but it works well for our purposes.
B004G8QSY4|5|My toddler loves this toy. It lights up fun and has different settings. Good child toy. I would buy it again for another child.
B007XL658K|5|We love these! Soft material and baby stays swaddled
B00NLP590C|5|I ordered the Blue Dog pattern and I am quite pleased.  The blue is so vibrant and pretty and the quality of the material is thin like I wanted, but not TOO thin.  These blankets are BIG too!  For the price and for what I got, I am very, very satisfied with my purchase.  Would recommend highly.
B008KOBZ7K|4|My 7 month old likes playing with this toy. But we have to continuously watch him while he plays with it though, it tips forward easily and the hard plastic can hurt if it bops him in the head. Usually I have to hold on to this toy whenever he plays with it, so it doesn't move or tip forward and hit him.<br /><br />He does like closing the lids on the animals whenever they pop up. He unintentionally makes the orange sheep pop up and as soon as it pops up he is trying to close it again. So, it really helps his motor skills. The blue cow, you press down on the switch. The yellow horse, which is the hardest for him, you have to twist for the horse to pop open. It looks like you are supposed to press it, but it won't open unless you twist. The orange button presses down for the sheep to pop up and the green one has a key to turn to get the dog.<br /><br />The bright colors attract his attention and he loves to play with the animals and push them back down. This toy is for 6months+ and it is a great toy for a baby to play with during tummy time.
B003ZDGCK6|2|I do not recommend this stroller. When my baby was an infant we'd go for walks and I enjoyed it. But as he got older and warmer weather I wanted to go jogging with my jogging stroller. But everytime I actually jogged I had problems. I read the instruction manual instructing me to jog with the front wheel in lock position. (all attachments were tight and put together correctly.)  I tried that but was unable to make any turns or adjustments. Everytime the trail (paved) made any curve I had to slow down, lift the front wheel and make the turn....or drag the wheels across the pavement. So since that didn't seem to be the way a jogging stroller would work I just tried to jog with the wheel in the swivel mode. Horrible mistake - the front wheel wobbles extremely hard....the stroller almost tips over it wobbles so hard. So I tried jogging in both wheel positions and it is impossible. I was really disappointed that the only thing I can do with my JOGGING stroller is WALK.<br /><br />It's a good WALKING stroller. Very comfortable for baby. Good storage on the bottom. Comfortable to push. Easy to snap a carseat on. Easy to fold up the stroller. I really wanted to love this stroller, but since I can't actually JOG with my JOGGING stroller, I am very disappointed.<br /><br />I contacted the company to see if there were other things I could try so I could actually JOG and they said that is just how the stroller is. I explained that I can't make any turns when the front wheel is in lock position and he said that's just how the stroller works. I've learned that some of my neighbors have this same stroller and have the exact same issues.
B0051POJQA|5|We bought this for my three month old daughter and it has been fantastic. She loves the flashing lights on the tiger most of all. She will lay there and smile and coo at it for a good fifteen to twenty minutes. In new baby land, that is a nice little chunk of hands free time! My husband and I have started putting her down on it when it's dinner time. We can actually both eat at the same time by doing this! The gym is very versatile. They include extra loops that you can hang toys from, and the included toys can be put in various different positions so your child gets lots of different things to look at (although my girl just can't look away from the tiger yet). I've uploaded a picture of her smiling hugely at the tiger. So cute!
B001CFFX90|3|be careful with this one....yes, it adheres to the shower or tub enclosure, but even with repeated applications and careful pressing down on the handle, at times it slips.  do NOT put any pressure on it....I think it is ok for balance only.
B00E9F3LZS|4|Not as soft as the bamboo swaddles but still fantastic! The bamboo line has definitely spoiled me. I'm a die hard fan of A&A and have a ton of their products for both my 3 year old and now my newborn who is only 11 days old :-)
B00A67C5UU|4|just need to remember to pull the buckle part out before you set them in. otherwise you have to fish down between their legs....
B0085CBA90|3|This didn't include any directions.  I didn't realize that you were supposed to add these to your current flanges, instead of using them alone.  I returned them because they were expensive and I didn't see the difference.  wish I would have known so I could have tried adding them before i returned.
B004C053AQ|5|good
B0064NA7Z0|5|just what was looking for to make a ball pit! they are bigger than I thought they would be&that is a great thing!
B009EDSWJA|5|You get a great gadget for the price, which helps a lot with changing your Baby. The pad is easy to handle and can be placed anywhere (bed, couch, kitchen table). It is also easy to clean, since the cover is waterproof and your baby stays safe on it. Still never leave your baby unattended, while it's on it, because you never know. We enjoy this pad as it is a great relief from the ordinary changing options.
B00IVNEGO4|4|This potty it really cute and so much more fun than the other plain options out there. Would get 5 stars if it had a non -skid bottom. On hardwood floors it is a little tricky for my toddler to sit on when she is scooting her bum onto it. I'm hoping that doesn't lead to unnecessary messes with we start officially training.
B005UV0USQ|4|I love the colors, and having a playpen around with a baby is very convenient.  However, the changing station, is not very sturdy.  My son is almost 3 months old now, but since before he was 2 months old the changing station began to dip a little when placing him in it.  He only weighed 10 pounds at the time when he started weighing it down.  My guess is that I won't be able to use it at all in the next month or so because of the issue.<br /><br />It has a light which was fantastic for the first few weeks when he roomed in with us.  Not having to turn on my bright bedroom light at night saved me some time because he didn't fully wake up.<br /><br />I haven't really used the newborn napper, but it looks comfy.
