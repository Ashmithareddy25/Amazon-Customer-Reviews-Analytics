B0021UPC7I|5|More than expected!!
B000PL2AZC|5|Fit my 1995 Dodge Dakota, and works great.  No need to gap.  Trucks is running great.
B004J0YRXI|5|Works perfect and will be making more purchases in the future....
B006K8JJ1C|5|Easy to bend by hand and polished easily..
B0016IULOK|2|Had to return the kit because two out of three extraction tools were defective.

B00HLBG0UK|5|Great for home use
B004I1B86W|5|Fit my 2007 Kia Sedona EX Perfectly.  Didn't know how bad the old one was until I replace it with this.  Install was quick and easy.  Loved that all the bulbs were already installed too.
B008B239GQ|5|The helmet is GREAT!!! The fit is spot on! and it came with a tinted screen. Matches my bike perfectly!
B002XM51CA|4|fits great and is a good addition to the rv
B007LICSEA|5|Great product
B00WZXACIA|5|Looks good
B0018YD2QQ|3|These are great shocks, they are comfortable for a lifted vehicle and would use them again especially considering the amount of money for the alternatives, such as bilstein or fox. The reason they received only 3 stars is because one of the main reasons we purchased them was because of them being adjustable. We understand that you will never get close to a stock ride with a lifted vehicle, however there in our opinion there is no adjustment, yes there is a dial from 1-9 but we're here to tell you it might as well just be 1 & 9, if there was a difference between 1 and 5 we could not tell at ALL. it is the same ride. 9 is stiff for the desert roads and what you need for that.
B002MQCY7C|1|Wouldn't work. Waste of $8.
B004SSAFFU|5|nice
B005TY2BOK|3|Did not have side bolts or support.
B00DGVRXD2|3|Did not work on my gas cans, good product but the problem is with my gas cans.

B007XZK8LG|5|It gave my Ram truck the custom look I always wanted. It set my truck apart from the rest. I get a lot of looks and thumbs up from the grill
B007QBTN8Q|5|What can I say? Bolted on easy and works great. Good replacement starter.
B00S82M3GG|4|it's ok can't figure out why it stays on 24/7 but hey it works ...
B000TYQB1Y|5|Got the job done + fast shipping. Thanks!
B00032KBFE|1|Did not fit on my Toyota
B00ESVYXDC|1|Not what I expected at all. Does not fit tight like any other skull cap I've used. Garbage
B00EEJMEQ6|5|PERFECT FIT
B0085IK9MI|5|This worked perfect for my travel trailer 4&#34; rear bumper. Used for a bike rack and held in place very well. This can be installed both under and on top of the bumper per the instructions (on top of bumper for bike racks is preferred).  I would recommend this to anyone with a travel trailer that needs a hitch for any additional items like a bike rack.
B003VAWLLM|5|Great thank you on time delivery
B001L9ZIBA|5|Everything as advertised. Sticks perfectly to the '91 Ford truck we just bought. My husband is very happy with this color.
B000BQUJL8|5|worked great. easy to install.
B00DJ5KEF4|5|works great! charges fast!
B00FR0H7E0|5|Shipping was good. It looked exactly as the picture shown. Looks so cute on the back of my car, already had some compliments.
B00KAOE0XO|3|The charger that cam with it was not the charger in the picture. The showed is variable 6V or 12V. the one i received was output 13.6 - 14.8 V  1000ma
B00139FQSS|5|I have this between my battery bank and inverter. So far this product functions as it should, I have no complaints. I've never had the breaker trip on me as yet tho, but I like how I can disconnect at the touch of a button. I would recommend this product.
B000EDQR4Q|5|I use these in my freezer as well holds everything in as it should!!
B007KPV1MY|5|Great product. Easy to install
B009TLNTFO|5|I wish more people were smart enough to understand it.
B00NQGDPYI|4|It didn't feet perfectly but good enough.
B005MZXR30|5|Perfect size for my Escape. Colors are bright. Sturdy
B002INWTJC|3|In order for this to work properly you should spray some penetrating oil on the old sensor for a few days ahead of time, I used P-Blaster. It also helps if the exhaust is warmed up. Don't forget to use anti-seize when installing the new sensor.
B00L9HKMK6|1|Did not fit my car
B00IOBQDTY|5|Like it
B00HJDI22E|1|Flash is barely noticable
B00LFQ877G|5|excellent products
B00TMFD498|3|serves its purpose
B005GOM2I8|5|This EternaBond is so handy.
B00BO3UKLG|4|Quick shipping, product could be better, price not worth it
B001D21XGE|3|Good replacement for my 2007 Ford Expedition EL Limited (5.4L 3v v8), but not exact fit.<br /><br />The pressure lines are perfect fit, but it didn't go back into the holder perfectly. There is a very slight difference in diameter of the lines.<br /><br />Improved fuel economy 1mpg on combined highway/local. Improved acceleration feel (smoother) and makes the transmission shift less.<br /><br />Replaced the original fuel filter after 89,000 miles.
B00KAU3NS6|4|Does the job! Dont waste big money on others. This will do same if not more and i have no issues. Install yourself. Very easy.
B00DQ4TJUO|4|Works good. Car still gets hot as hell, but then again, I live in Texas.
B00GSAUHB8|3|I have never had a sunshade before so I don't know how to compare it but this seems to work decently. It's not super cool in my car when I get in (have to factor in the sun coming through the side windows) but seems like it does help knock the temp down a few degrees.
B0082OYG3I|5|Exactly what I hoped it would be, effective.
B007Q1DQHK|5|fit and works great
B00DBENZPO|4|Good
B00F0H9HN4|5|Love everything about these gloves.  Worth every penny!
B00473V668|1|Did not receive as pictured received a different type. Can't use but for the cost I kept.
B000E28EWU|1|Did not work at all.
B00B5KYS02|5|Great kit! Everything for perfect and the online video is a real plus. Color match was spot on and the extra passing feels great. My console looks like new
B0002MA4WK|5|I bought these, obviously, to construct a ramp. I have an ATM ramp, but it is grated ND the grates are too large for my equipment wheels to roll up and down.  So, I found a couple 2x10's and bolted these bad boys on.  They are very sturdy and I am grateful for the enclosed feet to keep the metal from scratching my truck bed.
B0010E3JUI|5|Good!
B00BGSFDNE|5|Much better value than buying by can in store. I use this mainly on riding mower deck wheels and steering shaft. Over 700 hours on mower no problems yet.
B00KRJ82FO|5|Great price and fit my OEM key perfectly.
B00123J79O|4|love it
B00O99UR5G|5|very much needed
B00551DZ3S|5|We love it, fits on the back of our fifth wheel perfectly.
B000N9LCH8|5|work perfect and a whole lot  cheaper then all the other places i looked at
B00HUM510U|4|It's big and bulky but fits great.  Can't go without one of these in AZ if you expect to touch the steering wheel after it's been out in the sun.  I just roll it up- don't even bother sticking the hook and loop closure.  It's too small for something this size and the sticky backing just melts and detaches anyway.
B006QH55YW|5|Best Battery. All my vehicles have the yellow top and they never fail, even at sub-zero temps.<br />I have a red top in a truck for over 10 years now. Still going strong like the day I purchased it in 2004.
B003RVWKH0|5|Works like a charm :)
B00B2AF0MU|5|Beefy unit, works as advertised and I was able to re-center my frontend after renewing the worn out steering & suspension bits on my '98 XJ. Only gripe, it's not adjustable on the car - you have to drop one end out, make adjustments, reinstall, re-measure; rinse, repeat as necessary. Granted, the on-car or 'double adjustable' setups are a lot more expensive by comparison, so you get what you pay for.
B00FX40C9C|3|as of today, 8/4/15 I cannot properly review this due to the fact that I CANNOT understand the directions, or If i need a special tool to put this on. I tried...I tried...and I tried to figure it out BUT this is the rainy season in florida and I refuse to mess the one I have up on there now or I am screwed.<br /><br />I am going to take it into the Hyundai dealership and have them put it on.
B006OUNMUA|5|Great quality filter brand. Perfect fit.
B004QJ7ZQI|5|Works great, Polaris 500 Ranger EFI
B005SUX9MI|5|Worked perfect for replacing the wheel bearings on my '00 Softail Deuce.
B00HWOATVM|5|Helps save gas for my truck.
B005VLAK6C|5|Fit perfectly and is exact duplicate of the original.
B000C9C8EK|4|Works as it should. No issues as of yet!
B000AY71W6|5|Good looking heavy-duty chrome-plated license plate frame. I have had two on my truck for 18 years and they have held up extremely well. My only criticism is the blue and gold paint fades a bit with time. They use to sell these in the Navy Exchange, but no longer. I know where to get my next ones: Amazon.com. Highly recommended!
B0053ZL4KM|5|Perfect size for my back windshield.  Received in great time!  Durable for outdoor display.
B0007PHD0S|5|Got rid of the bad smell coming from the dash vents on start up. Totally satisfied.
B000C7S4VS|5|Great product----works fine.
B005U3KF7K|4|Design flaws. Item was not aerodynamic resulting in lound sound of wind at higher speeds. After removing from luggage rack it was difficult to put item parts together to prevent losing parts.
B00NGIE1TE|5|Exactly as described. Fits perfectly,
B00BCRMBGQ|1|Didnt fit my seats the way i expected.
B000XY5030|3|Did not work to my expectations, I had to buy different pegs to fit my feet.
B006TMLUVQ|5|I love how easy it is to replace this tail light. Now if only I would stop hitting it ..... Second replacement
B00IB2S6JG|5|Perfect fit. I'm sure it is better quality than the one that cracked at 60,000 miles. Watch the YouTube video and save big bucks! I forget the name of it but search around and you will find it. It took me about 5 hours.
B003R2MG2S|4|Yes they look and feel nice but my back row has a shoulder seatbelt on the middle seat so i had to unscrew my seat belt and cut a hole true the covers to make it fit
B002MF0O1G|5|The front of my car looks great, I can see again. I was quoted $50.00 a light and a 3 hour process to clean my old ones. In 15 minutes I changed these, they are new and saved me a little over $15.00. The hardest part was finding my socket wrench. Love them, which I had done it a couple of years ago. Cleaning them myself was not lasting long at all. The way to go!!!
B00IM6QZ9E|3|Actual Touring logo on 2015 Honda accord hybrid is much smaller.<br />Good quality, easy to install
B00CMU98N6|5|Really nice part
B0024ECDL4|5|Received in good condition
B00GSAUHB8|2|Shade works fine however stitching is extremely and tore 1st day
B000JFL8RK|5|works great
B00B51X8WU|5|Very impressed ! Beautiful paint match. Great product. Installed it myself.  I'm 80 years old.
B00C0WVV72|4|did mthe job
B003OBRSRA|1|Did not fit my car as advertised...
B00FBQNR5I|2|Did not hold up, came apart easily. Will not be ordering from this seller again!
B000CIRUBC|3|I bout this for my husband. It was just what he need for the winter to keep business going!
B00IKSL90E|5|Bike looks good quality
B0090NE9JQ|4|Worked as it should
B00J632NBG|5|Was easy to install and works well
B00KGSCTYG|5|Beautiful bag, and the black bag with black buckle look great on my 2014 Sportster Iron with the black denim paint. The fit is very tight. I had to remove the battery cover and passenger peg to install the bag. The passenger peg can be installed with this bag, however it will crush the bag inward about an inch. I will be installing a passenger peg extension to overcome this problem. The velcro straps included are heavy duty which make them slightly difficult to work with but it can be done. There were also plastic strips included that were sticky on one side to attach to the swingarm in the places the velcro would touch so it does not wear off the paint. I compared this bag to a Harley branded swingarm bag. The Willie & Max bag is made of thick leather throughout (about 3/16 inch). The Harley bag has a thin layer of leather over a plastic inner. I feel the Willie & Max bag looks better and fits better than the Harley bag.
B004AGAFLO|5|Worked perfectly.  Came delivered as promised and with no damage.  Great product.
B0026H82LY|5|no more torque wrenching, one step deal
B007HP76F8|5|KTI Tire Inflator Gauge works Great!
B00D954UW2|1|Only got the two bottom mounts and got charged for the &#34;combo&#34;54.95
B00A9ZP4LG|5|I. Have. Gotten. Many. Compliments. On.  This. Jersey
B002HBTWVI|5|Best price in the market for a good quality brand.
B000CD6HN4|5|Outstanding blades! Metal along top is kind of industrial looking with little prongs/protrusions, so not the sleekest. A great traditional wiper blade to replace stock or crappy Rain-X Weatherbeaters that I picked up on sale at Rural King 6 months ago. Fit perfectly on my 2009 Camry Hybrid, I will try to report back RE: longevity...
B0085DBDVE|3|The water tank is fine.<br /><br />Works with Nissan Sentra SER  2004 Model.<br /><br />This issue is that the product doesn't have a hole for the water sensor.<br /><br />The description doesn't tell you this.  I had to drill a hole and patch it for the water sensor at the bottom.<br /><br />It's a big hassle.  Besides that it's fine and the water pump works fine.
B00Q34EY40|5|I had a choice: Buy a new steering wheel or cover up the crumbling and cracked foam areas of my old one New wheel $200: New cover less than $20= No brainer.This cover once on is nice looking and has a great texture and feel to it. In back-upped traffic it also serves as a therapeutic tension reliever as you squeeze and twist it to release pent-up hostilities  ( probably why the original wheel fell apart to begin with ). But getting the cover on takes some work as it is very tight on a typical 15.5&#34; steering wheel. Here's how to put it on in less than five minutes:<br /><br /> The directions say to heat it by laying the cover in the Sun making it grow and be more pliable. Don't bother. Instead obtain or borrow  two strong spring clamps and a flat crow bar nail remover ( a tool 1 +1/2&#34; wide about 15&#34; at Home Depot or find something similar ). Start the cover ( I put the seam at the very bottom ) and shove on as much as you can on the bottom and clamp both sides. Using the crowbar get under the cover and pry/force it to the far side of the wheel. Don't worry about breaking it, this thing is tough. As you force a section behind the wheel move the clamp up to hold it in place. After forcing all the cover behind the wheel gradually begin pulling the front edge back over the steering wheel ( it will move easily at this point ). Once you start with this action the cover will basically just pop into place and is easily twisted and centered.<br /><br />Once on the cover looks great, is tight and is ready to relieve those tensions from your next 'stalled in traffic' nightmare.
B0031HEIDY|5|Save yourself $40+ bucks at your local auto parts place and get these. They work perfect!
B00KJGPQP4|5|That upside down 720p 60fps definitely beat my old go pro
B00FUXJUGW|1|Only one of the bulbs were an actual 9005 the other was a 9006.  If you're looking for blue lights these are fantastic. If you are looking for functionality buy something else. They're not bright at all just blue.
B000BZX920|3|I have gone through 3 of these pumps in the last few years. When this one dies, I will probably change to a different brand. They work great, until they just will not pump, with no warning.
B006VN3GHY|5|Everything you need for a retro fit of a Xterra. Perfect fit.<br />Youtube videos will walk you through simple install.
B001M0XR3Y|5|This plate always makes a Corvette stand out.  We put a blue LED light to shine on it so it really pops.
B004RHAFGQ|5|Worked just as it should.
B001UHHMRG|5|good stuff
B000CFQM4G|5|Works great and is one of the cheaper around!

B00029JK5K|5|Good Value
B0055DQ2RC|5|Looks like they will fill up with water when out side. Might be bad in winter. Lock works well.
B00171UV82|5|needed it to lube my O rings for my a/c system on GM cars. was a good price and prime.
B000GVAPGW|3|Rack is heavy you will need risers or star washers to mount.  Kury support could not  answer questions about mounting through lid and liner.
B006QH55YM|5|great price , no problems
B00DUGVHTE|5|Love it, they're doing a good job
B00LB47Q8S|5|works great

B0018ICAMO|5|Installed easily, does it's job. Great product.
B0046I9FSU|5|perfect
B00DSD67IA|5|Yes Sir, its a sticker!
B0018Y44Z4|5|Nice cover -- easy to put on -- fits snug but not too snug.  Keeps the rain out!  Good value -- would recommend.  Comes in a nice bag but, as others have stated, throw it out as its too much work to get it back in there.  We just fold it neatly and keep it in the trunk area of our 2 door Wrangler.
B000UVUAFO|5|It works.
B000BQW5LK|5|inexpensive but effective pump
B000IYI2NU|5|Perfect fit for my 2013 Mustang GT.  Literally took less than 5 minutes in total to put this in.  It does the job like its supposed to.
B004QQ8SEY|5|all good
B00UMUYVUS|5|This item works fantastic!!!  Highly recommend it.
B00B2AG2Q8|5|Easy to install
B007X4F2G8|2|the flange that fits into the bracket to allow the ladder to be removed or tilted bends,  not safe, not good
B00SYVX2OI|5|Matches factory black paint perfectly, be sure to reuse your factory hardware. The ones with the kit are a little inexpensive
B000FW2MWW|5|Works in neither of my vehicles.
B009XOTRBM|5|GREAT PRODUCT!!!!
B00FB3MT7S|5|Love this sticker
B00EPRAHAC|5|Fit perfectly and looks great on 2014 Silverado.
B0118LONBQ|5|[[VIDEOID:e38faeffd586dbd8bd77faa1833302bc]] I installed this light bar on my Honda Civic, It looks good and its really bright for its size! Here is a review video I made for my YouTube channel......
B00K1NS0PS|5|Husband like the lights
B0012TZ04E|5|cool mask thank you!
B00AGM9FHQ|4|They don't have extra flap what is on picture.
B002TMLJL6|5|Great mats.
B00OBXFFCA|5|used to snap boat windows (eisenglass) to hard top
B00T68UAN4|5|Just bought a 2015 Fusion Hybrid and this is my first mod. I wasn't going to bother... felt like I was adding a convenience for the mechanics at the dealership more than myself. However, I'm really glad I did. The kit is trivially easy to install and just works wonderfully. Don't expect a silky smooth movement, you can really hear the operation of the gas cylinders, but they add a touch of class to the process and mean you'll never have to mess with the stupid hood prop again. Very nicely made kit and I recommend highly.
B0024E6TQY|5|worked perfectly.
B0013RKEPA|5|Bought this for my 16 year old son's jeep. He is learning how to drive a stick and wanted to see the gear shifting pattern. Kind of a pain to change out but worth it.
B0031BJULU|5|Great product
B006OSNUZE|5|This helmet saved my skull, I got hit by a simi truck on a scooter, this helmet worth every penny I left on a stretcher and broken neck but they said that this paticular helmet material saved my life I could be dead today, and the way it opens in the front is great to talk so it dont sound muffled. But love it!
B000GU5M5C|5|Great!!
B004LPAP2I|1|Did nothing to remove any fine scratches or swirl marks. I'm not impressed with this product at all. Followed the directions to a T. Didn't see any sizeable results. You'll also notice you have to re-apply a wax after using this product. Basically their admitting this product does nothing and you'll have to cover it up with something to get any shine or durability. Typical for Chemical Guys products.
B0031GG2KC|1|Your site indicated that it fits my 2000 4WD Durango,, unfortunately it did not... It was for a 2WD Durango... I lost trust in your site
B0002SQZQ8|5|Shipping was fast. Tool got the job done.
B00RQNX0JC|3|Color matched good. Gripping area was slightly different but functional.
B00KGJ28J6|4|Looks great. Squeek after rain.
B00O4CV2B6|5|Excellent quality with quite a bit of heft. Removed my other keys due to weight and bulk in my pocket. Very happy with this.
B0002JMUZC|5|Can't beat a proper OE filter.
B003D1QVJ2|5|great item but delivered late.
B00GBBCMDA|1|Shouldt have bought it from Oremorautogroup. poor return policy. Im Never buying from them again. Replying to my email and not acknowledging if my complaint is legit. This is the most tiring mat i had, it only lasted 2 hrs in my car due to poor material (slippery) and shallow ridges, i have to reposition my feet always.
B00RE6KV48|2|I have a leather sofa and chair that have both lost the shiny protective coat that was there when they were new. I've been looking for something to restore them, and still haven't found anything. After reading the product reviews I was hoping that Leather Rescue might do the trick, but unfortunately it didn't make much of a difference at all.
B00R1FIWXY|5|Works like a charm for 1/2 the $ Auto Z wanted for it.
B009YMG7PW|5|Fits just fine and Installed easily.
B003NAMITU|5|Advertised to fit the Miata and it fits like a glove.<br />Solid, substantial rubber. Rolls out flat and stays that way. The edges do not curl up.<br />This mat has some weight to it. This is not a cheap one fits all liner.<br />I expect this mat will last longer than the vehicle.
B00B5ZY07I|2|The product is overall not bad.  But for my car the screws were about twice as long and twice as thick as the holes.  So there was no way to make them work. I wanted to use the caps at least but they wouldn't fit the screws that came with the car.  I went to return the item but was very disappointing to find out that the amount they charge you to ship the return is almost as much as the total cost of the item.  Giving me a total refund of $1.20 after the shipping.  So I guess I just wasted money.  I'd rather just give them away to someone then go through the process for a $1.20.  So my advice is be sure the screws look like they will fit before you purchase because clearly it is not a standard thing.  On my new car the screws in the back were very different in size from the screws in front for instance.
B00FUNPBA6|5|Excellent quality graphic us awesome
B000P7O5DG|5|Have five of these and work very well
B008XNZZ7O|2|It doesn't last long, it even says on the back that it shouldn't be in heat or sunlight so don't use this in your car
B00LXGELK0|5|sturdy plate cover
B00OUJ87L6|5|fits great, looks great, and came with a extra bolts in case you lose one and came with 3 new push pins for door panel very happy would definatly buy again, and came with mounting bracket for behind the door panel as a support for the extra big tow mirror in case your truck didnt come with tow mirrors very pleased!!!!
B004QBWI40|5|Salvage yards ask as much as this new manifold. cost! Thanks for a suerior product at a great price
B0044FRZ28|2|it burned out too quick only after 90 days.
B00BGZ22M2|4|It was nice to get so quickly and have it fit description perfectly.
B0040UAVOG|5|Outstanding product and highly recommend!
B001G9AMES|4|As of now works as advertised, has been installed a few weeks and no issues yet. Only complaint is that I had to take the dash apart about 10 times to get the device calibrated accurately. The settings for the tire size ratio was off so had to play with the numbers to get it close.
B000CPIH1C|5|I finally got to install this on my Cherokee, and I love it! I have no blind spots now, which is great when my doors are off.
B000GVH6A0|5|Great product!!
B011Q18D14|5|I absolutely love this OBD II Scanner, it works like a charm. I'm able to plug in, read the code, understand the code, fix the problem and then clear the code.  No more running to the local auto store to have someone else read my code errors and they can't even clear it.  My husband is a motorcycle mechanic by trade but also works on all years makes a model autos.  It won't work in his 1987 GTI but I have a 2009 Mazda CX7 and with having the same engine as the Mazda Speed 3's you can only imagine the upgrades I've done to my awesome SUV.  I have ahad a check engine light on for a few months because we unplugged a few unnecessary things and I was easily able to clear those codes and now my dashboard is clear of errors.  I look forward to using this scanner in many cars. My friends have already caught a wiff of the fact that I have my own OBD II Scanner and are in line to come use it. I'm going to tell them all to buy their own!
B0077K8TPY|4|works good in every 2 stroke I have.
B0002JN2EU|5|Seafoam works wonders. I use it in all my carburated motorcycles.<br />It keeps them running clean and smooth.<br />It also helps reduce the wear from ethanol gas.<br />So, far this is one of the cheapest prices around.
B00FLFYZSC|3|No opinion.Ended up not needing the part and sent it back.
B003GV46MI|5|Use it to modify intake manifolds-handy, but takes a little experience manage set up.
B00ADLHN3S|5|great product!
B0012TRBPK|5|The battery was very easy to setup and I had it in my bike and working after allowing it to build charge for approximately 30 minutes.  No complaints at all.
B000637TE6|4|Nice stuff, but kind of expensive.
B00FC22JU0|5|I ordered these under the assumption that they'd be plug and play, per the reviews and product information.  Unfortunately, the Hi-Lo version of these lights requires a dedicated power line from your vehicle battery, along with a dedicated ground.  The kit itself was a single unit for (2) headlights, too.  Meaning, you can't split them apart to use on a motorcycle headlight.<br /><br />I can't speak to the quality of the lights because they weren't hooked up.  Though, they did look like they were good quality and were packaged extremely well.<br /><br />**UPDATE** I was contacted by their customer service department rather quickly asking how they could remedy the issue I was having.  For this, I have increased the star rating to 5 (from 2).  I have also ordered a different model that the care agent said will work as needed. On top of the recommendation, they also issued a partial refund for the inconvenience.  This type of care is what will keep me coming back as a repeat customer.<br /><br />The next review will be a review of the actual product, not the ad or customer service.  That will be of the 35w Lo/HID-High/Halogen model from Innovited.<br /><br />Thanks again!
B00QFX0PM4|4|Works well. Glad I bought it.
B004GC7A24|5|Easy to install. So far, (2 years) not a single problem.
B00KL3ALGO|5|Excellent product.  Adheres and removes easily; folds compactly; shades the sun effectively.
B00062ZSEA|5|Fit perfect. Quick shipping.
B00Z23D1GK|5|Excellent product, helpful tech support, would do business with anytime.
B00B3YMOUQ|5|A1
B00429NKWK|4|It worked great, but my left headlight started yellowing before my right one did. It could be user error, but I did follow the instructions to a T.
B0019ICJ2O|1|this is not 2.3 inches in diameter,nor is it 6.5 inches long.<br />it measures 1.8 inches o.d and 1.76 i.d and is 5.8 inches long.
B00K0VMXDQ|5|I purchased two SCORPION Car Jump Starters for birthday presents for my sons-in-law.  They are both very pleased with their presents.  They haven't had occasion to use them for jump starting autos, but both have used them on trips to power computers, cell phones, etc. on trips especially when traveling outside the U.S.  I plan on purchasing two more - one for myself and one for my father-in-law.<br />Sharon Rabeneck
B005Y1W8AA|5|The dealer quoted me a price that was 4 times the price paid.  Installed easy, just watch  you tube for the installation
B00WNGV0WG|5|THIS PLAY SURFACE IS REALLY NIFTY. IT FITS RIGHT OVER MY SONS CAR SEAT AND KEEPS ALL HIS TOYS WITHIN HIS REACH. ITS NICE NOT HAVING TO REACH BACK WHILE AT A STOPLIGHT TO GRAB HIS CAR THAT HAS FALLEN. THIS IS SUCH A LIFE SAVER ON LONG TRIPS. HE ALWAYS HAS SOMETHING WITHIN REACH TO KEEP HIM BUSY. I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNTED RATE FOR MY HONEST REVIEW.
B0012TSQL8|5|Good filter no problems on my S&S 107.
B00R45Q2H4|5|Fast delivery , nice touch for the car
B004RCRS9I|5|Washing my truck made easy.
B00030DLEE|2|The plug in wire did not last more then a week it blew the fuses a few times .. finally stripped off the end and do it directly on the truck battery
B00R1NPMEI|5|Great product & fast shipping
B00CTFOSCA|5|Quick and easy transaction and product fit like it should
B000C32JN6|5|Excellent Quality product fits perfectly.
B0084TIE3E|4|The decal looks great on my window, but I did have a couple comments.<br />First I ended up with a couple bubbles which is probably just my fault in the application, but it is still a bummer. They aren't big, but they are kinda bothersome. I only applied it a couple days ago so it is yet to be seen how it affects the longevity of the decal.<br />Second was the size. I'm sure if I had just read the specs I wouldn't have been surprised, but I expected it to be larger than it is.<br /><br />In all a great little decal for your window or bumper.
B00K8MT0CO|5|FIT LIKE FACTORY. BOLTED RIGHT UP AND LOOKS JUST LIKE THE ORIGINAL ON THE OTHER SIDE. IT WAS A GOOD VALUE AND WAS SHIPPED IN A QUICK MANNER
B00VL9LNVO|1|As u can see in this photo the wires burned out and Came out on its own and burned out my power wires
B00BFDHKCW|1|This engine mount was destroyed in 3 days.. Still having trouble getting it off car because I don't have another one to install due to it being over 100 dollars.. Don't buy car parts off amazon.. Car manufacturers want you to be ripped off at the stealership.
B000MMOJUS|3|Straight out of the box, the emblem came off on both sides.  Not enough glue is my guess.  The cable seems very sturdy and is made out of steel,  however the hooks on both ends are made from plastic.  The whole unit seems sturdy, I will update after a month of using it with my name badge.
B003P5YJWW|5|great
B000C33MI2|5|Very good oil filter to use to extend your time between oil changes.
B000FOIJXQ|5|Made my grey turn black again. Gives some streaks that you need to work out, but LOOKS nice a NEW plastic again.<br /> I thought there was nothing I could do for my faded black plastic. This stuff is like jet black paint that soaks into the plastic.<br />I'd buy some just to keep doing touch-ups. Makes an older car look new again.
B00E838HY6|5|Just as described
B004Z76CDI|5|As discribed, quick delivery
B004L5WLZ2|3|I think meguiars nxt does just as good of job, and at a cheaper price.
B001DKQL6I|5|Thank you
B00029XBCI|4|Love it!
B00P2W0JB6|1|Unhappy
B001H2FAIW|5|a high quality OEM part received as promised
B0063CU5CM|5|I'm not sure what some people are talking about with their negative reviews but, I have a 2015 Tacoma TRD Sport and this deflector fit perfectly. The instructions are very accurate and the mounting holes in the deflector and the truck hood matched exactly. I installed this deflector in less than 15 minutes and it looks awesome.
B0026A5AIE|5|Great Whalen is the best Lights to get I would recommend to volunteer firefighters
B00N8B9H9S|5|2009 Fz6R. Love this item. Looks and feels way better then stock.
B00WAK0QXE|5|This worked well in my 2006 6.0 Powerstroke. I was experiencing some stiction and light smoke.<br /><br />After only one treatment the engine ran quieter, smoother and I am experiencing improved MPG about 3 tenths right now.<br /><br />I will use the oil treatment and fuel treatment from now on!
B00NX8EYFI|5|decal looks good on my jeep's window it was easy to put on and I have a traveling Minton with me
B0015PK3AG|4|Could have used a little instruction as to the size of the wrench needed to fit the nut on the back, but otherwise worked great.
B0024E6ZRW|5|Works great and easy to adjust. This made the steps on my RV feel like real stairs. I no longer worry that we are putting too much load on the stairs when two of us end up on the stairs at the same time or we are carrying heavy items in or out of the RV. You may want to consider getting two of these if your stairs are wide.9
B00V7OHP6K|1|It less only 2 moths and stop working,I used resistor and carefully installed but it wasn't worth it, wasted my time and money.
B00EZWQDZA|5|Visit the Web Site if you're in doubt....the video shows how easy this is to install and it looks as good or better in person.  It does make a difference in fore-and-aft (but not necessarily lateral) wind turbulence in the cabin and the reduced noise makes it easier to talk to a passenger or hear the sound system without blowing out the speakers. It arrived well packaged and within the stated delivery window.....you could pay more, but I doubt you'd get a better performing windblocker, just fancier graphics if that's what you want.  This one at this price is a bargain.
B00LS5R0PO|5|Came in a timely manner and worked as expected. Easy to install.
B00LT03MEG|5|Love these nice thick moto socks!
B00CZG6WO0|5|Very bright.  Easy to install
B000Y5AGS2|5|I have had one on a couple of different bikes over the  past 10+ years. Currently on my CBR.  Works great. Holds glasses, smokes. gloves and some other stuff. Always stuck tight to tank. A little sun faded. Still holds shape. Very glad I got it. A great addition to any bike.
B001KOF05A|5|They look a little goofy on my DS650, but I don't care.  I love having my hands protected from the rain and the cold air when riding at night!!  I've tried all sorts of water proof gloves, but they all suck compared to being able to ride with your favorite riding gloves no matter what the weather!  Some guys say they interfere with their riding.  Not so, unless I'm looking down at them.  Don't look down at them while riding!
B000YE6RKE|5|can't beat the price
B00RXXLNNK|5|It got rid of my sciatic pain highy reccomend it
B0046ID5EK|5|Exact replacement for my original remote.  Came with simple, very clear instructions.  Had it programmed almost as quick as I could read the instructions.
B00429NKWK|5|easy to use, looks great
B00OVBC0HA|5|They look and fit great
B002UJ13QO|5|Excellent product.
B000I04Z7Q|5|I purchased mine in February 21st of 2015 I've had them for 6 months now and they still work perfectly fine, only downside to this is the many wires it comes with it I try to keep mine hidden other than that it's great!
B000GVATFE|5|Item fits great, even after I bought over sized aftermarket radiators.
B00RPIJZHY|5|Easy to put on....has held up through 6 carwashes so far!
B00U9T5N2W|5|Works Great
B00GB9SNTE|5|Excellent light. I am using it on my boat and it makes for a perfect headlight for motoring around after dark. Stays cool and produces a perfect beam for my application
B00HRST9O6|5|perfect fit
B0055DPFUW|5|great strong product!
B007IVQWVU|4|check your parts book, said would not fit my 95 jeep wrangler se, but orderrred an fit great
B00AMLNFZE|5|These lights work very well for us and are super brite
B000GOG3QK|5|I think it's been almost a month. Seems to be working perfectly.
B004MUI7OA|5|No problems so far...
B0068MZJT6|5|First time using this and it worked as manufacture filter. They did a great job of sending it to me. Will order from them again when needed.
B00JRWDL12|5|This mass airflow sensor arrived on time and only took minutes to install.  It solved my check engine light warning and the car runs efficiently again.  I saved hundreds of dollars by ordering the part through Amazon and installing it myself.
B00QI7FPM2|5|It worked well.
B007VSYNXY|5|Easy to install, sounds great, looks great (especially in my matching Daytona Blue Z).<br /><br />Install tip - heat up the anchoring screw and it'll screw into the plastic a lot easier!
B00SNQZME2|1|Any and everyone look ridiculous in this helmet. I'd post a photo, but I would never publicly share it.
B00AYXM4DY|5|Used to restore the plastic shutters on the house. They look brand new again! Great product.
B00AGK2CJG|5|Easy to put on and look great. Also didn't take as long to arrive as expected
B002TAEB4A|5|Fits my Mazdaspeed Miata 2004 perfectly. Nice understated finish
B000CNB5GI|5|I've used these in the past & have always been happy with the results.
B005G3XFW6|4|A+
B005V9MWX8|3|The halos are not very bright.
B00BJ7YY00|5|good quality,  good service
B002G1UO7U|5|Fits perfect! Thank you. Co version from 12 to 134 a breeze.
B00RY9S9TE|1|Was notified by a police officer yesterday that when I hit my brakes, that my reverse lights would come on. I disconnected the tailgate light bar and it was fixed. This is my second faulty set. Not at all pleased. The first time the running light function didn't work.
B010MRDFZC|5|Was looking for some mounts for the roll bar on my RZR. Clamps worked perfectly and are rock solid. Very highly recommended !!!
B008KKN2FM|5|They fit well,
B004I0DSQG|5|Fix good on my 325ci 2002 bmw
B000W0RQ8C|5|Fits nicely.  I used some thin rubber grommets so it wouldn't rattle.
B00MTIJBYM|5|Very cool,  made a great birthday present for my husband to put on his Harley
B00T9SS4SY|5|Absolutely love it!!
B00HJ1577Y|5|Love, love, love.  Just adds that little bit of bling.  Would buy again and again.
B00O2IN6JI|1|They are not tight to the window, leaving streaks and both have fallen off at one point.  One on the freeway, so I couldn't recover it.
B00CNI1SDA|4|It's Ok.
B00FVPZKR2|4|the only thing that I do not like about it is when you use the remote start and get to your destination the tail light and front light stay on after you turn it off, even if you put the keys in the ignition. To turn them off you have to hit the unlock button on the remote which makes the really loud alarm beep and deters me from using it as much as i would if it did not beep.<br />for the actual alarm, it works really well and is very sensitive. I have actually forgotten it was on and it goes off when i just put my hand on it.<br />it was easy to install, it plugged right into my TaoTao moped and took all of 5 minutes
B00KTHVJ36|1|They don't work. I switched out the guts of the original and put in new cases. Btw that's a little tricky but manageable. I tried both cases with two different remotes and they both didn't work. I am a fairly handy person so I don't think it's from a bad install. They would work if only slight closed. Once I fully closed the halves they wouldn't operate. Tried to figure it out but gave up. I would not waste the money on it. It did not deliver as described.
B001BNFV0Y|5|Thank you
B00JMGAZIA|5|A really good fuel system cleaner.
B00RSI3NI8|3|This item was as expected. Well made and I'm satisfied with it.
B00563UJ3Y|4|I loved the professionalism, and this FOB worked better than I thought it would. The only down side is that there is a space between the hooks where the FOB connects to your keys that makes it seem like it could break if you squeeze/pinch this part too tightly.
B00KQT2PLC|4|It works
B008UFPTYY|5|Thanks
B000TXYDK6|5|Exactly what I needed
B00DSD666S|5|Great exactly what I wanted
B000WEPJ2S|3|Fits well, installs easily, looks good.... BUT... on the rear windows of our Odyssey, the Weather Tech deflectors prevent the windows from sealing tightly and we get a lot of wind noise with the windows up.  Quite annoying.
B00EC2CN2K|5|Sturdy and strong. Does the job.
B00D9GZSF4|5|Works as advertised, I put it on my Harley and went to the left turn light that never changes for me and instantly it gave me a green arrow.<br />Installation is easy, just sticks on.
B0051PJWQW|3|A month later, and it's the headlights are back to yellowing.  They're not hazing up yet, but we'll see how long it takes for that to happen. Guess I'll just polish the plastic with some 3M plastic polish every couple of months.
B00BG8WIC8|5|it was exactly what I needed. it flexes around corners & at right angles. Well made too.
B00IP4Q17Y|5|First Great Thanks!!!!!!
B00JDPSK14|3|Part number matches what I ordered, tooth count does not. This is a 14t not a 15t. Contacting seller to see what they can do. Part is very good quality though
B00WV055CK|2|We were surprised of the size of the net when we got it.  Short height.  Put lg. size bottled water and it flopped out of net on my short distance home (easy driving also).
B000CIT3NU|5|This filter arrived with the oil i purchased. Way cheaper on Amazon then at my local retailer. arrived promptly and exactly what was described. I would highly recommend it and i would purchase this item again.
B000COCU8O|5|easy to install and work great, brighter than the factory originals.
B00669PWOS|3|Lettering blurred by &#34;clear&#34; protective cover
B0023VITP2|5|Right part Right price!!!
B00PEY0GDI|1|for the cost not worth it. 10 for a sticker is a bit much. i could have gone to Wal-Mart and paid 4 for a plastic decal.
B005NYDRWQ|5|perfict fit !!!
B00J3364D2|5|Exactly what it was supposed to be.  Thanks.
B00DMEFH7W|1|I'm really upset. I bought these cause it specifically said it would fit my car. It was not designed for split bench which is standard on my car it also had no spots for the seatbelt buckles on the back seat. I had to cut a slit. And last the back rest was not designed to fit the built in headrest so I had to fold it. I'm happy with the fabric color and front seats but don't say it fits a car model when it doesn't
B00SNQ544K|5|Good
B00ANZHG4U|5|LOVE IT
B00904WS84|4|good
B00D44TID4|5|shipped quick<br />perfect replacement just like the factory fuel pump. easy replacement took about 1 hr. to install comes with all lines and sock on pump.
B00I0T0TUE|5|This product was awesome and just as the instructional video described, pretty easy for two people and a heat gun (both highly recommend)!<br />Can't wait until the next wrap project.
B00B3V33N6|4|This vinyl spray worked surprisingly well.  It was used on leather and looked great.
B00NPRMOV8|5|Good fit in a woman's purse and seemingly easy to use...
B00Z1Y5SWU|5|Great service. Item worked well.
B000EDUUG2|1|I would not recommend this product.  The broom sweep folds open, but will not stay in place and folds back up on you when you try to sweep.  I thought it would be nice product to have handy with my RV since it is compact for storage, but I have come to believe that the vaccum is easier to use.
B00PFN82GQ|5|These are small edge guards but look very nice on the car. Provide minimal protection as well.
B00I8Y3RYQ|5|They worked great.  Very easy to install.  Came with complete instructions.  Very fast delivery.
B00EE1VYRO|1|Poor, does not fit
B001AGHMJA|1|Was not the size advertised, too short
B001QVC6ZE|5|Works great, easy to install. No more ball joint clunk in the front of my Volvo.
B0009IQXFO|5|Very good wash and wax
B00063Z4AC|5|just what the doctor ordered
B00Q8CZ56S|5|Fantastic product. I recommend using this  any opportunity you have.
B00OABJ0VU|5|Came quickly and was packaged extremely well.  Quality of product was excellent. A+ all around!  Very happy with my purchase.
B00514C18Y|5|looks great
B00D39LG6M|4|Kinda difficult to install...but the finished product looks great.
B00NBN1C78|4|I haven't had to change a tire yet with it  and I hope I don't. But with this in the back of my car I know I won't be stuck on the side of the road with a flat tire and not way to change it.  It seems to be made of good quality material and should stand up to many tire changes.
B00YIJZXNS|4|They are a direct fit for my 07 KQ LT-700X.  The price and shipping were very reasonable...especially compared to what stealerships are asking.  The inner pad does not come with the backing plate so be sure to transfer from the old pads.  My OEM set lasted 2400 miles.  If these last half as long they're worth the price.
B00YNOGA1W|5|I purchased the YTZ14S 12v 11.2Ah 230CCA Battery for 2010 Honda VFR1200F/FD to replace the one in my generator.  The battery was the exact<br />fit and preformed just like the original. A great price great product.
B001KNVKU0|5|Can't think of any cons.
B000GU7I72|4|Fit my KLR 650 with large pelican cases just fine.
B007KTINWQ|5|this is a great product use it all the time
B00BTO90BQ|5|Excellent product. I had an older model and it finally bit the dust. This new one is lighter and just as bright! Very happy with this purchase
B00X095ZLW|4|Absolutely love it!
B000WJAAD6|5|My signal light is brighter and it looks factory. My rear lens where  broken so I replaced them, now  I'm replacing front lens so they will look as good as my rear onesl Can't beat the price
B000C7TTSA|5|Thanks
B004ZGOUEM|5|Works great in my Cricut Explore
B002TUGTRC|1|This was just too big for the sissy bar on the back of my bike.<br />Looks cheap just not what I thought it would be.
B00FFXDTEQ|5|Great price and is very bright, fast shipping.
B00BBE7KAM|5|Well made and compact...just what I need for storage on my motorcycle.  Haven't had to use it yet but I'm confident that it will work well when/if needed.
B000U0Z2L2|4|its great !
B0099XHQVU|5|Fit perfect!! Looks Aggressive!! Sounds awesome!! Increased my MPG by 3 miles!! Easy install!! Why are you waiting.....get one!!
B00A195TN8|5|I am glad I found the link to the part number for these on a review of the omix equivalent which only lasted me a few thousand miles before the bushing started shifting. These are the same gauge metal as the original equipment parts off the jeep and of same quality as the oem parts. They cost more but is your safety worth it.
B00HN4GTQK|5|This items is needed for my Jeep.  One should use manuf specified fluids in your Jeep.
B00Y8B523C|1|Very satisfied, brighter than halogen bulbs I replaced.  Gives off a white light which I prefer.  I have used 2 lights as night lights now for less than 4 months and one is barely showing any light at all and other one is out completely .  I gave them a 5 star rating when I first used them but changed it to one star after they stopped working.
B00AYXM4DY|5|Very good product.<br />I would recommend it for interior, the smell is very strong, and doesn't smell good; but it does the job
B005R0JMZC|5|Exactly what my Acura needed and I paid way less by buying online.
B004RNR9QY|5|Love the spring on the ends.
B003UT3S6Q|4|Works perfect but very small and expensive.
B00877SL2M|4|Work perfectly. Thanks
B001JT16LS|4|Used to store important docs... great buy for simple use.
B00N1WDJEI|5|Purchased this for my '95 GMC 1-Ton 4x4 dump truck.  This was used to move a part further from the engine which caused overheating and part failure (once per year or more).  My mechanic relocated the part using this extension and since then my truck has run quite well.
B0033DPIJE|5|Perfect fit...4 weeks later and no leaks
B000PWVK7U|4|fast shipping, jeep rides completely different!  I'm happy and will repost in the future to tell how they hold up. (Installed today)
B00BF37Q8K|1|The original left-front bearing on my 2001 Cadillac Seville STS would hum/vibrate at highway speeds.  (only when steering slightly to the right, like when changing lanes) and it was also time for a brake service. So I replaced both left & right bearings while everything was apart; brand-new calipers, rotors, quality pads, and two WJB bearing assemblies.  The new brakes are great but these bearings are _WORTHLESS_ no matter how cheap the price.  From mile *ZERO* they were/are noisy.  Both are louder than the bad 60,000mile original ever was.  At 25mph, constant bearing moan permeates the cabin, at highway velocity the pitch rises to a whine.  It comes from both sides, accompanied by a high frequency / low amplitude vibration up through the floor as those brief instants of perfect left/right side harmony occur.  I spent the extra time to do this right:  Cleaned all corrosion from the knuckle mating surfaces. Moly paste on the axle splines.  Bolts torqued to spec on re-assembly. (Axle nut = 118ft/lbs.,  Knucke-to-bearing bolts = 95ft/lbs.)  During teardown I used a hub puller from OTC that's made for the job.  Now I get to do it all over again.  &#62;:[  *UPDATE* August 17, 2015: Replaced the awful WJB bearings with Raybestos brand.   [[ASIN:B001CA2UNC Raybestos 713121 Professional Grade Wheel Hub and Bearing Assembly]]. My STS' front end is now vibration-free and quiet as a church mouse.  The Raybestos parts are likewise made in China.  We'll see how long they last.  Seeing as the original GM bearing started going south with less than 45,000mi, the bar is not set terribly high.
B00O3QCTN8|4|I really like this mirror. I opened it and had it installed in under a min. very easy. The only thing i dont really like is how far away everything seems. Most of the time objects in mirror appear closer but this seems to be the opposite. still very clear and still a great range of view.
B003SYI5KM|5|I love it fits perfect
B00T1PQ31K|5|Everything I wanted it to be!
B0092737IO|1|I didn't even get what I ordered- I got a navy one and it was crap! It sucked!!! Never order again
B003MRHAYM|1|Bad quality
B00E9HWRK6|3|Heavy duty but item might have been previously returned. Box been reseated several times.
B003GZE4L2|5|Replaced the stock unit before it gave me any issues since the plastic top cap had turned color to a greenish-brown. Even though this radiator is thicker than stock, it fits in the same location with the stock fans. Also installed new thermostat and new radiator hoses while in there, so the roadster is good to go!
B000CN71MU|5|No problems
B000NE7TJ8|5|Worked just as original.
B00H5CJAYS|5|Came without painting or anything but good product for the price of product
B006OQ35GU|4|Worked as it should
B00TSSSFNE|1|Had these put on yesterday. Fell apart today. Didn't even drive it to work. Drove my truck about 7 miles home from the body shop where I had them installed and one side separated from the foam. Garbage product.
B000IYBBTW|5|Perfect fit on 98 Bonneville!
B004AIJXMO|4|excellent
B000ARPVNY|5|Product delivered on time and meets all expectations.
B001C6N7BU|5|ty
B00YNMBHSA|5|Bought to replace my original remote whose buttons have started to work intermittently and are faded. Easy to program with instructions from the Internet. I used the key from the original remote so I have not gotten the new key cut yet.<br /><br />Works great, just like the original remote and even at a cheap price, it does not look cheap.
B001DKTG0G|5|The Best
B000CQ4AOO|5|works great
B000HE2VF6|5|really nice product, great case, buy again for sure
B00W3FQGNA|5|Great quality shirt, like the way it fits
B00V9VC714|5|These defiantly do the job.
B00PG2QA1K|3|Very light weight..Unless you have a plant on it..it will blow away.
B002NS8Z2C|5|exactly what I was looking for, and thanks to those who mentioned how bright they were/using them as turn signals. Very happy with them. Just remember that the wires are color coded RV style. white - negative, Black - positive.
B00LFOWB8O|5|Fits perfectly and shines bright. Literally night and day from the old standard light.
B000VL23VM|5|Good stuff
B00CNUI89U|5|Had to space it out with a washer to get it on center, but works perfectly!
B00KL3ALGO|5|Easy to install!
B00FRHOGU6|5|Works like new wipers, what can I say?  I admit I'm not a wiper connoisseur (couldn't even spell the word without the built-in dictionary), but I wanted new wipers I could install on my Ford Escape, and these fit the bill.  Couldn't be happier, although I wasn't expecting miracles.
B0010DZZQA|5|Perfect for RAV4 2005 2.4 liter. I'll buy again when I need to change it
B006ZOGYUU|4|This harness works well with the winch attached to my boat trailer. Makes for a fast connection.
B00BHZT9DG|5|It work just great
B006GLA8TA|5|As described.
B0076WUD2K|3|Smells bad. And hard to get the smell out
B00BJJZO1Q|4|Decent replacement.  Not a perfect fit between top of the arm to the vehicle, maybe need some glue.  Slight rattle that's noticeable if you look for it and roll down the window.  But definitely usable.
B008G3K7EC|5|Very  nice
B0002NILR4|5|Looks and fits great
B000C0TBAS|5|Fit perfect, the packaging had the path the belt takes for about 6 different configurations depending on your vehicle. It went on really easy and the performance on my vehicle has improved.
B00LX28WAO|5|It is been a year using them and they are so good, working like 6 hours a day average in a dirty environment and without problems. highly recommend.
B00BJCAPEE|5|Smells great leaves your car looking slick
B008HY31NY|1|My box was open, and only one bar end was in there. I paid for a SET.
B000B9181A|1|I ordered one and when I installed unit it did not work. Said it was at (EOL) End of Life. I returned it and received a new one. It came on ran for one day and quit. I called MTI Industries and they said these units are getting recycled even when bad. MTI is going to send me one from the factory if I return the one I purchased on here. It will be worth the return postage to actually get one that works properly. Someone is just putting defective unit back on the shelf and reselling them.
B000SKYL9I|1|Great product....why reserved only for Prime????????
B000CQTKVC|5|these work great on my ford f-350 2002
B007JSGR9Y|4|Great for the cash
B00IMPEWHM|1|I didn't order these<br />the tailgate latch came with them
B001TAPLYA|4|All went  well installed easy and looks like a new jeep. Also can see at night much better.
B0002MBBIQ|5|Perfect for my F-150 Raptor. Well designed and well made.
B009B87F8W|5|Fast shipping, Super nice cover for my Mercedes Benz.
B00L4V9ECY|2|I saw where many reviewers commented on the heat these generate. A 6 ohm resistor consumes 2 amps, thus 24 watts on the vehicles 12 volt system. Yes, this is going to cause a lot of heat.<br />But 3.25 inches long? I missed that in the item description. In many vehicles the space containing the wires to be jumped will not accommodate an item this long without touching something that should not be subjected to heat.<br />My mistake. I should have read the product description a little more carefully.<br />Then, I asked to return these. Unused and in their sealed package.<br />My cost was over 80% of the original cost as I pay a predetermined shipping to return them. Put another way, I was being refunded less than 20% of the price I paid for these, to return them.<br />So I'll just keep them and try them on another vehicle.
B002SB03IS|5|Great!
B001FJZNVG|5|big difference in intake and mpg for sure worth the money only con to this product is the heat shield is kinda weird how you have to put it together does not come as bolt on and go have to bolt the 3 sides of the box together and its all metal which heats up defeating the purpose of a &#34;cai&#34; but paint the tube and box with high temp paint and it actually cools it down and can make it look like a custom look love the way i have mine set up but fairly simple install worth the money for sure very pleased with it on my 1996 ram 1500 5.9 built trans, rebuilt motor, throttle body spacer, cat back 3&#34; to a 2.5&#34; straight pipe with a resonator 4&#34; tip great high range but definatly felt a good increase in low to mid range torque also
B001HJ60NE|5|This filter and transmission pan gasket fit like a glove on my 99 328i E46. Added bonus are the new bolts.
B00R7QTSQC|5|I used these for a variety of reason, including protecting myself from poison ivy.
B0078UAHJ4|5|So far, so good. I'm near the end of the break-in period and no complaints so far. Personally, I do not see any reason to spend more.
B0054RAKD6|5|Great product.  Fits CL 16 helment.
B0085G9P84|5|Came in early, easy installation, perfect fit.
B0030I3L4Q|5|Couldn't be easier. Pop the old hub off, clean up the spindle, new hub on, go fishing. Fit perfect. 500 miles so far and no issues.
B0093A9ST2|5|Works great in CALI sun
B008SGZ5D0|3|The sizing seems a little off, and this is pretty heavy on my daughter's head, but it offers a great deal of protection for her while riding her 4-wheeler.  Also, I think it would be better if it had an easy snap chin strap as opposed to the type it has, kids can't put it on and take it off alone.
B007RLPX4S|5|great item fast shipper.
B00L3NYVHQ|5|I mostly use this microfiber wash mitt in our house. It's really great for cleaning our mirrors all over the house. I just spray some glass cleaner and wipe it dry with this thing and the mirrors turns out smooth, clean and dust-free. It's really awesome on our dining table, coffee table and counter tops too. And it is really pretty cool to use, i just insert my hand inside and start wiping dusts or smudges in our home. I don't have a hard time holding it since i just have to wear it. And it's very nice and comfortable to use. ;) Also, the package comes with 2 microfiber towels, which is kinda awesome and we use it mostly for cleaning stuff too. My husband has yet to use it in our car, and from the looks of it and my experience using it in our house, i know this is a great quality microfiber wash mitt. I got this complimentary product for testing and review purposes. All thoughts and opinion are of my own and were not swayed by anyone.
B00OZACVSK|4|Made in china but it seems ok other than being bigger than the factory one. Its hard to get it into place but it should provide some additional cooling
B001C6Q8M0|5|Very sturdy.  Exactly what we were looking for.
B0009YDQE4|4|Looks good in my daughter's car.  No problems.
B00KTI9Z9U|5|Works great!
B00DD0ZO14|1|Really disappointed with this. Super pretty but it seems to make the car hotter then it was without it
B00252KEHK|5|Great Item  quicker than ordering from local parts store. Exact match to original.
B0079GPYA4|5|Good product
B004WLNZZA|3|Definitely minimizes the seatbelt from rubbing on your neck.  In getting in & out of the vehicle sometimes the pad gets twisted and then you have the velcro side to your neck with is a different feel of uncomfortable.  Once it gets twisted back into place the fit is better.
B00651CLCS|1|Broke first time through car wash!
B0049MVCKM|5|This is used on an Audi SQ5 with MMI.  At first, I purchased a competitors brand that was half the price. It provided a 6/7 Pin to 4 PIN conversion, with test lights.  I noticed that it was missing some of the PINs in the circular part of the connection that connected to the Audi, but that manufacturer stated that those pins were not needed for doing a simple 7 pin to 4 pin conversion. The audi detected the missing pins and the computer displayed a critical error on the dashboard. The parking assistant / sensors were flashing an alarm, and the parking sensor was beeping to indicate that I was about to hit something. The error message and its beeping sounds would not stop. However, the trailer lights were working. , I returned it.  I bought the Reese model that is in this review. It has all of the pins populated in the 6-pin connector. The audi's computer recognized the adapter as a &#34;trailer&#34; and not as an adapter (maybe because the switch is set to Brake Mode).  The Audi's computer changed the shift patterns, the braking sensitivity, the orientation of the back up camera to focus more on the hitch area, and properly disabled the parking sensor alarms.  The adapter locks nicely into place, and fits the opening very well. I must remove this adapter when not pulling a trailer, as the Audi confuses the adapter as a trailer hook-up.  By removing the adapter, the Audi returns to a high-performance SUV. No big deal, as I keep the adapter in the glove box.  This adapter has a switch that says Brake and AUX.  I have the switch in the &#34;brake&#34; selection.
B002VVC4TG|1|Unreliable purchase ... the AC Delco 15-11057 was missing the thermostat.<br />All I received was the aluminum casting.<br />Now my repair is delayed.
B00SVRHD22|5|Nice supply at a good price.  We use these all over the house.  Great for cleaning lenses too.
B008QXZ5BM|5|Great
B00IMVNKOM|1|doesnt spray right, other cheaper nozzles work better, sprays great at firs then drops off  and sucks
B00TT7RWYC|5|Top of line lights, all mounting hardware is supplied and they are easy to install. You can either power the kit thru your fuse box or the supplied car adapter your choice.  The lights are very bright and are buillt to last. I have purchased this kit, plus the interior and wheel well kit plus two expansion sets and I very pleased with the quality and brightness of the lights. For the price you can't beat it.  The sound function works great, just have the control box close enough to a speaker as it works off of vibration.
B00BITIGXU|5|great product
B00ATPBW1W|5|This sticker is great! The shipping was fast too! Gotta love NPR!
B00KTHYDA2|5|easy to program for a 2007 Toyota 4Runner.
B004SJIERK|5|fit great
B00OXMDTSG|5|Dope ass sticker
B00KTJ31NA|5|work greai
B0040CRWMS|5|Product was exactly as described and quick shipment.
B00KS3EUW8|5|Thanks you
B00LPSOAX4|5|Came in on time. Great product and kit.
B0009Y2CFS|1|Didn't heat up at all. Not sure if product is defective or just not good, but either way I'm not satisfied, and want my money back. Any way i can return this?
B00BLX1L4O|1|Followed all the instructions as far as cleaning and using a heat gun to adhear to the steering wheel. Looked okay was a bit out of place but after only 24 hours the peice fell off. I guess that I kicked it with my feet and bent the part so it is now unusable. Will not bother with these cheap cover pieces anymore.
B007VJYEHI|5|Delivery time was outstanding. My 11yr. old  grandson thanks you very much.
B000924E60|5|fits great
B00Y4H96O6|4|Great product and very quick shipping. However when i received the part it was dirty with a little bit of glue/epoxy on the bottom side. Nothing a little Windex could remove.
B0038YO9Q6|1|Arrived broken.
B001CA4GGQ|5|it works perfect on my ford f350 2002
B001C6L5EQ|5|This is the control arm of your dreams!
B000IX44YW|5|these seal are perfect for my ford f-350 2002 for my bearing seal  for rear axel
B004BWU8AA|4|After you pound on the latches to get them to match your truck box it's good
B002KS6LLW|5|looked exactly like the old one, works fine and a lot cheaper then the polaris shop prices
B00NDN4ZE8|5|Great towels, super soft and absorbant.
B002E5DT2A|5|it fit and works great on my 2004 dodge sprinter van
B003CWYJF0|4|I thought it would be a little heavier weight, but all in all I'm very satisfied with this product.
B00026Z3E0|5|Looks strong enough to me to hold 6000 lbs.  I don't care about the cosmetic part of the welding that doesn't look a fine delicate product.  Laser welding would make a product look really pretty but will also cost more.
B000AP57PI|5|Allows for much better airflow on my bike.  Have purchased many K&N filters for my vehicles over the years and will continue to do so.
B007NA9CAE|4|just wondering will they fit my 90 gmc full size
B00B2ASHVG|5|excellent product
B0007ZL174|5|Fit my trailer just like a glove. Quick and easy install took me less than 10 minutes and this product saved me right before a big rain storm hit 24 hrs later.
B000GVD0VE|5|Just got back from a weekend trip with this case, not much to say except it works great.  Fits my dual sport helmet perfectly, so it's really nice to keep it empty when banging around town to keep helmet and valuables in.<br /><br />When on a trip, it just swallows stuff.  Super nice to have a secure lockable case to keep valuables in, so that you don't have to carry them around all the time.  If you don't feel like springing for a Givi case, this is a great cheap option.<br /><br />Wasn't in the rain so I can't comment on waterproofness, but I'm sure it'll be fine, and c'mon you already put all your critical stuff in dry bags... right?  =)
B00I5HRFYY|5|Never again will i get stuck in snow with noy of getting mpulled
B005G7Y5I0|5|Perfect fit
B00AUKQRM0|5|Apparently everyone loved it too much. Had it on the Jeep for a week…needing to buy a hitch lock. Stolen in Wal-mart parking lot. Yeah - real &#34;Batman&#34; of him/her :(
B007HRI6U0|5|Split loom
B004KCVR06|5|Looks great on my vehicle!
B00RXEASA8|5|Works Great
B000B9181A|5|I replaced  my original  a little wider but works great.
B00COYNVPQ|5|High quality for the price. Cushy and comfortable.
B0007N20GM|5|Functional & easy grip!
B00QMWQK2M|4|Greet product.
B00IS94FK6|5|Very pleased!!! Looks awesome and was very easy to install. The added amber reflectors look really sharp also.<br />these were something the others didn't have as an option.
B0002ZVMQO|5|Put in in boat now motor runs much smoother...especially noticable during 2 to 4 cylinder transition. Motor designed to run on 2 of 4 cylinders under 2000 rpm.
B00HWZMC6Q|5|Perfect fit
B00T7DOA6Q|4|would be 5 stars if included PIN wiring diagram
B000CN940W|5|Quality that you expect from Energy Suspension, 'nuff said.
B0099SL31Y|5|Very helpful tool in my box.
B00080QHNG|1|piece of junk!  don't waste your money
B00I176GOI|5|Thanks
B0012TPVC0|5|Makes the job easy.
B000W0RQ8C|3|Looks and works nicely. It didn't fit right out of the packaging. I had to remove a bit of material from my hitch receiver to get this lock to fit
B00BUL2DK8|4|Looks great. Fitment could be a little better, but nothing that noticeable. Orange is a little off the KTM orange, but its close. Product is made in China, but substantial materials are used.
B00CMHY0UA|5|awesome
B00LSDEGX0|5|Going to California for vacation, and this will be perfect upon my return to scrapbook!
B000IY42BG|5|Exact replacement for my 2007 Ford Expedition EL Limited (5.4L 3v v8)<br /><br />Got rid of the annoying fake supercharger whining noise from my truck. While it was only the bearing that had gone bad, I chose the replace the entire assembly.<br /><br />Few things to note:<br />1. The pulley end of the tensioner may not have lateral play and rotate true, but the bearing can still be very broken.<br />2. The pulley should not spin endlessly when you spin it by hand. It should have a bit of rolling resistance for proper operation (but should be smooth).<br />3. You can just replace the bearing in the pulley, but it's in there very very very very tight.<br />4. You cannot &#34;WD 40&#34; the bearing to bring it back to life<br />5. Bearing is $4, pulley and bearing is $12-15 and this whole tensioner with pulley and bearing is $25-30.
B00QL0Z3Q4|5|This decal looks awesome on my car, which is dark gray with dark gray wheels.  As long as you are patient and careful with pulling the backing off, all the little pieces will stay in the right spots and the installation will be perfect.<br /><br />If you aren't sure about the size, get a ruler and see how big it will be.  I love the fact that it isn't a giant obnoxious sticker on my car.
B004BCJJO6|5|Great product! Even came with bulbs!!
B00KTIUG5C|4|Everything works perfectly as far a programing them for the Mazda B3000. Only issue I've had is sometimes when I click unlock it won't unlock. Maybe like a glitch, but that's only occasionally.
B002RW244Y|5|easy to apply, easy to use and very beneficial when it comes to towing
B00230MECM|4|My wife had to sew this so that the straps were attached as the 2nd time I wore them they came unstitched.  Otherwise a good product for protecting my boots.
B008EBCF64|4|Good filter but would like one that is a bit larger to allow more oil to flow through it.
B00WE8F2O0|5|What a simpleton... Tpms is as simple as tying shoes. Your car has a reset/calibration for Tpms and they go out like light bulbs. That's like blaming your phone because of wifi
B00B9J21QW|5|One of the best things we have bought for our camper! This makes life sooooo much easier. great product.
B00Q3Q1RKC|4|Did not fit but there trying to help me
B00GBVHPNW|5|I love these gloves however they arrived with a loose thread on the part that Velcros around the wrist on the right glove. A bit of thread fixed this. What was not in the description, and is really cool, is the fact that they have air holes with screens on the middle knuckle area which allows the gloves to breath and keeps the hands from sweating with the airflow.
B00GJX1NYE|5|Worked perfect, Thanks
B00AGPF1LM|5|Well, the OEM molding went bad and I replaced with BMW molding 3 years ago. Now that one is cracking all over as well. I wouldn't worry about getting aftermarket vs BMW here as the BMW molding is of poor quality. Hopefully this is better. I mean, I know rubber goes bad, but I had much older cars that never have this problem.
B00NCTS7P6|2|This was all fine and dandy, until I dropped it [like it's hot] on the floor and the whole bottom cracked off. Phone was fine fortunately (in case you were on the edge of your seat wondering).
B00C5SVM5M|5|Absolutely awesome! Great design and strong!
B006WEUGK2|5|just want they wanted it was prefect thanks again
B00TEA5PZC|5|Thank you! Love this product! And thanks for the fast shipping! Great service!
B00AZPRK1W|5|Great fit and well made mats.  Highly recommend!
B009ZPH4HS|5|I will give them 5stars…  Also. Cheaper than car parts stores!!
B00B8T1150|4|LIKE IT
B00BXMRP4I|4|Woks good, I only need a vacuum pump occassionally, so perfect for me.  If you need to use it everyday you may want to purchase a commercial quality pump, but for home use it is perfect.
B001UE1SZG|5|part came as discribed
B00S4UJM16|5|Perfect fit in our 2009 Fit and resolved the fan-only-operating-on-4 issue.
B00A14QM52|5|Perfect
B000W0UZHG|5|I used this tool to disconnect the fuel filter line on a 2007 Ford Expedition EL Limited.<br /><br />I like this over the metal tools since it's easier on the parts (and lines) and it's solid/firm enough to do the job. I see people frequently break lines and clips using the metal tools.<br /><br />This tool make the job super easy. Using the tool was easy and clean up was easy.
B00K8CIG2O|3|Everything when great and speedy with delivery! The product itself is no different from the original equipment -- meaning it is not strong and will not hold up well with use over time. Atwood needs to come up with an aluminum model. I ordered a couple just in case and we are handling the door with a little more care.
B00D6H6XU0|5|I am enjoying this. I am known to drop my keys and phone a lot so this saves me money.
B00652G4TS|5|I LOVE this tool!!  It is very easy to set up and provides a wealth of information about my vehicle.  I have also used it on other vehicles to help diagnose issues.
B00W648WWQ|1|This item was scratched and bent when I got...very unsatisfied!!!
B00B5UKSVU|5|LOOKS GREAT
B0002NYE48|5|Got it on time, and was what I expected

B0002MAB00|5|Well worth it, very nice... look good on my ford ranger

B005ST1WXC|5|Great product!
B008D70NAO|4|good product,enough to change oil twice
B00FZJ32YM|5|was exactly what I ordered and have had it installed window works like its new
B010G31Y5A|5|Cooler than I expected, but be careful... It was hard to get off the transfer paper. Looks great!
B00872VNP4|5|As described. Great iten
B00G620ZVU|5|These were originally purchased to go along with a pair of 60 degree floods mounted on my off road vehicle. These give the reach that the others lacked. I can not over state how bright these lights are! The light is a very white light with the added benefit that it makes any road sign or road edge marking almost jump out at you. Off road they are like daylight.<br /> Highly recommended and well worth the price.
B00LPX1K6Y|5|I'm very happy with the product and the price, shipping was immediate and the service was great! I ordered this on a Sunday and it arrived the next day, Monday!
B009PAK6V4|4|Update day received: August 3rd came when expected even though it took awhile was happy they were so beautiful and all waiting until morning to install. Appreciated they leave note on site for installation.<br />Update day put on: August 4th<br />Front seats fairly easy hardness 1/10 my head rest were hard to get off but they look lovely<br />Back seats way too hard for me hardness 9/10 lol I just put them on had good has I can but on video it said the middle seat had a zipper for my seatbelt but there wasn't either way I'm not angry I love the look and recommended anybody
B005R4LFIU|3|My husband loved the headlights but all the lights have already burned out and have been a pain in the ass
B000CIXOQC|5|Had hooker sidepipe mufflers on and the 360 CI engine wouldn't go. put these on and she worked great. Sounds very good too. The paint was very nice too. They are loud.
B006E0O4U2|5|Easy out with the old seal and easy in with this new one.....
B000E19EH0|4|Good product
B000GV95XQ|1|Wrong spacers in box nice quality control lol
B0010AN0SI|5|worked perfect, it was exactly what I needed.
B007TY4STY|4|yes I was very satisfied!
B0093LYB20|5|The mirror works great! Nice size and a good quality. Every auto should have one.
B000CQI202|5|Had the type that you unscrew a little to disconnect battery and was junk compared to this knife blade style, positively shuts off battery.
B00BD6OLZU|5|Looks great on my SUV
B00MQ1GF28|2|Adhesive worked fine but didn't work with my mirror as indicated it would fit my car when I searched the car.  You cannot replace just the mirror/glass on my side mirror of my make/year model.  So was a waste of my $.  :(
B004GEDLMA|5|Great product fits perfect ,fast shipping
B00JMCCGDQ|5|Great oil for 2015 wrx
B002SSMGCW|5|love it
B00BMU9742|3|Looks good on my Toyota Corolla but when it came in the mail one of the hubcaps was cracked, still looks fine.
B006HY8DC0|5|husband is tiger fan and he was happy putting it in his truck
B005NLQAHS|2|Well I ordered the obd2 on a Saturday night and received it Monday afternoon so the shipping was fast. I downloaded the torque app and it would talk to my cars ECU. I tried Uninstalling the torque app and installing it again, I tried with my car on acc and in the on position and running but it kept saying &#34; can't talk with your cars ECU. Is your ignition on?&#34; My car is a 2008 Acura TL. Did I just receive a faulty product? Does it not work with my car. I was really looking forward to this obd2 reader for my car but so far I have not been able to get it to work. Am I doing something wrong?
B000CQI0W2|1|Cable broke the first time I used it. Not a happy camper.
B00FXE51WA|4|Super comfortable (fits my head way better than Fox & O'Neal), and excellent price for a Fiberglass/kevlar shell!
B006166OR0|3|ok
B007TY0G1I|3|Was not level at the seam.
B00L4TF32G|5|Great stuff to protect against UV damage.

B001HL3S82|4|Came as described. Perfect replacement for the plug in my Homelite trimmer.
B007DE8KL2|5|Stitch is my favorite character and now he can go on every adventure with me! (Seeing as he is on my car window) haha. Great quality. I would recommend.

B00JAXRZQ0|5|All good
B009S31VVW|5|Perfect fit & match!
B0024EC74M|5|Haven't used yet, but it looks like it will work great.
B00A4LCRPG|5|Arrive fine an not a bend in it at all. Thanks barb
B003LVZE0G|3|ok
B009UOPSOK|3|2009 Honda accord....They delivered 3 dome lights and 3 courtesy lights. 1 dome light didn't work (original bulb worked, LED failed to operate).....Then I tried to install the courtesy lights in the doors.......the lights wouldn't pop into the receptacle. I actually had pushed it so hard that the bulb socket popped into the inside of the door.....So now I have to take the door off to fix it....
B00NF1PU4M|5|5 star  worked perfectly
B000XQ9MGE|4|Works great always keep it in my car u never know
B00RPQH8OS|1|Horrible. You would think for the higher price one would get a better product. The switch sticks and has to be removed from the housing in order to correct it.
B0099M2RYC|5|We have a houseboat holding tank and almost made it new cleaning the walls and sludge in the bottom. Awesome stuff really works.
B008CQEMN0|5|Perfect need a second one family r second grandson
B0009TU6YW|5|Exactly what I needed.
B00CJ3AF0Q|5|Does the job!
B002MEWUG4|1|One headlight was broken on inside! Didn't know it til today when it was installed!
B0099M2RYC|1|I gave it a one star only because it would not let me give it a NO star!  Don't waste your money! I have tried this product two different times in black and gray water tanks. Did as directions said and they both stunk very bad!  Emptied both tanks And did again with  same results. Don't waste you money on this product!
B0093E8SRG|5|Fit like a glove and worked great on my 1997 wrangler
B004K9ESB4|5|Fit great  Right part
B00FYO8UL8|3|Worked OK... Sensitivity adjustment not effective enough. But at this price point what do you want!
B00YOK9R3I|5|Had to wait a little while to have it shipped here from China or wherever but seems to be very good quality and well-made
B000C9QZ62|5|works well. good quality
B00CMWGN8M|5|No problems!  The only thing that could made this better is that if the screws would use either Phillip, socket, or hex head instead of flat head.  The flat head is a lot easier to strip in my opinion, especially for my 2001 pathfinder where I can't really see the screw heads.  Remember to adjust them, every car is slightly different.  I found that using a multi-meter to measure the DC voltage between the throttle position sensor lead and the battery ground is much better than doing a discontinuity test with a feeler gauge on the idle switch.  Remember this has both the idle switch and the TP sensor together.
B004IAI4SI|1|We should say it fits most vehicles. I cant use it cause it is to small for my car.
B00G21K16E|5|Works great
B0046B3VWI|5|These fit our 98 Cherokee perfectly. Great protection.
B00HS16FLM|4|It is actually square, I expected it to be trimmed like it looks.  Will need to cut around it for better looks.
B0000AXQPA|3|Works great some parts cheap
B00230G0DG|5|They work great on the gs500 and cost less than the factory ones.
B00DT42U8O|4|Sounds great and looks mean on my 1993 accord honda 4door remove the silencer and it growls even louder good stuff for a cheap price and it shipped fast
B000BGHSNK|5|Perfect fit great price
B006MM3O3A|5|Works and fits perfectly on my 2007 Polaris Sportsman 700. Saved me from having to pay $350 or so from one from Rocky Mountain. I also purchased the Caltric starter bendix drive and that as well Is perfect.
B00BSGJQ4Q|5|works as expected.
B004I1BEW0|1|Absolute junk. They look good, and that is about it. Very limited adjustment, and when you do adjust them they break. I put mine on in December and now in August I'm buying a set of factory lights to replace them. They are bright and have potential to be a great set of lights, but they are built very cheap.
B00BGZ0NBO|5|I'm always dropping my keys and have damaged more Fob's than I care to admit. You can see the type of damage below before I got the cover.  I love the Silicone Key cover and it protects the plastic casing on the Fob.  I have them for all my Fob's!! I will say that I don't care for the black color....it seems to show dust/lent/dirt as opposed to my orange one.
B009BFSYI0|4|Great sticker a must have! Just post it on your door and when an armes intruder breaks in just hope they don'r rape your wife or rob your house!<br />-from loving husband
B00R6DV1E8|2|I have purchased 3 sets of weather tech mats. The 1st set was for the 2004  Nissan Morano. They are perfect, fit great, and have held their shape.  The 2nd set was for my 2014 Porsche Cayman. They are thinner and do not fit properly. I was told to turn them upside down in the sun and that would help them conform. That didn't work - they bulge at the sides. The 3rd set is for the 2015 Chevrolet Tahoe. They are not as thick or sturdy. The mounting system for the front mats is not secure and make it difficult to remove the mats for cleaning. With each set purchased, the quality has declined considerably. What was once a bargain at the price now fails to meet the American standard. I would have no problem with the price if the quality was consistent with the first set I purchased.
B00IKMC6M0|4|Gets a little loud on high but not l bad and moves plenty of air on low and medium settings anyway.  I recommend this fan for anyone looking to ventilate their RV.  Installation was a little involved but not as bad as I thought it would be.
B00EZEC32A|1|Very poor quality, low grade ceramic. One was broken immediately upon removing it from the package. Other had poorly designed plastic tabs which did not lock onto the bulb well.<br /><br />Highly recommend you do not purchase. Find another brand.<br /><br />Look at picture. Good quality high temp ceramic does not break like this.<br /><br />Cheap imported junk
B0012TPVC0|5|Awesome, yet simple tool to clean your chain!
B000TXQOSK|2|I had to ship this product back as it turned out it was extremely thin - perhaps 3/32 of an inch, but clearly not thick enough to provide the heat insulation I needed in my engine compartment.  Had the advertisement indicated it was this thin I would not have purchased it, however, I will say that if you have  a need for a very thin reflective barrier, then this might work well for you.
B00BYH6C1E|5|Excellent product, easy to install, and finally something to keep all my crap from falling between the seats.
B000GD5FMY|5|These are a fantastic deal! I needed dark and clears and not yellows (not sure what those are for? Snow?) They are snug but not tight (my head is a small/medium (I'm a woman) so a big head may have a different fit experience. The foam is adequate enough and not too much. They stay put. I'm very happy with this purchase!!
B009AQS5H0|5|Looks great!!
B000C1OWJC|5|These are very good brake pads and the hardware that comes with them are first rate. They work great on my second generation Camry.
B00K7938LW|2|Didn't fit the license plate.  Too short to reach the bumper through the plate
B007DGK2D4|5|Awesome! A+ great seller!
B005WWP99S|5|1 mile per gallon MPG increase. Doesn't sound like much, however... Going from 11 MPG to 12, do the math. It pays for itself and then some. Not to mention cleaner injectors, EGR and general wear on motor by using less fuel.
B0009VIQ1A|5|Fantastic for those days you don't have the time to wash your car. The more you use it, the better it works. If you regularly wax your car (at least twice a year), this can take off rain marks and a great amount of dust and streaks. Looks like you just did a quick wax job!
B00CJ01IHS|5|Too cute.
B004I0K8JG|5|Great fit to replace seriously hazed over OE headlight. Installation was straight forward, however some may find the retaining clip difficult to push down onto the new assembly since the pieces that lock on the retaining clip have not been broken in yet. I had to use a little persuasion, but I did get them to lock properly in place.<br /><br />These assemblies do come with a new 9007 headlamp bulb and 3457 turn signal bulb.
B003K2AS98|5|Perfect fit on 2007 Scion tC. Exactly as described and replaced my old set of stoptechs that lasted quite a long time.
B00WVJR0D8|5|This LED works great. I installed on a 1997 Harley Davidson softail. Plug and play. They give off a slight blue tint, but I'm ok with that. I was going to buy a &#34;day maker&#34; headlight through Harley for $525 bucks for my 2014 street glide. I'm glad I didn't. I'll be purchasing another bulb to install on the SG.
B00IBO5N86|5|Need to get another for hubby now, lol
B00F89VJ1C|1|not worth the money .
B00E3UM876|4|ok
B000SL4A84|5|This is a nice first aid kit. The products are all there. Bandages, steri-strips, tape. All you will need for minor events and enough to get you by until the Paramedics get there for those major events.<br />The case seems well made. It is soft sided which I prefer. This fits in a corner in the trunk nicely.<br />This is one of those things that you hope you never need, but have to carry because someday you just might.
B00ZIS9AW8|5|We have a Subaru STI and these are the orginal replacement clips. There are 15 clips to a package, part No. 90914-0007.  These clips are used on the bumper, engine cover, fender & grille push-type clip. I had a few clips that needed replacing and these fit perfectly. Solid and strong. I can't believe they sell these for a few dollars a piece and I got 15 in this set! I now have a few extra around for when I need to replace more pieces. Great deal!<br /><br />This set of clips were sent to me at a discount for my unbaised review.
B001KSCF2W|4|Good buy
B000CI8XT0|1|First off everything that is in picture is not in package the package was all ripped up banged up
B000YQQZCW|5|I keep one in my garage and one in my Harley they work great no problems.
B00DCZN2MS|4|Took maybe 30 minuets to install very easy, looks ok. Poor quality control had several noticeable dents and imperfects in the paint. Also one of the holes to put the bolts through wasn't even milled out so I will have to drill it myself.
B00PV37ZEA|4|I purchased this as a gift so have not used it.  However, it seems very nice and sturdy.  It is large, which is good when  you have children!
B00BUCAHCS|5|Perfect replacement part.
B000GV3WDU|4|Very well made seat but if your 5'11''man on a 1980xj 650 the driver seat seat to far forward made you fill like your riding a sport bike so did not work for me
B00CNUUU5A|5|Works great, great service
B00FAICTZ6|5|Looks great...., Just what I'd expected..., Thanks
B005H52TUM|1|It says 1 pair but only brought one bulb
B0015DMJ2S|5|simple & fast to measure brake shoes or pads
B007RW2XYA|5|Fits my 2008 Prius perfectly and the price was much lower than Walmart. I would buy again
B001GBVM86|1|I had this shipped to me and then re-shipped, and each time it only came with the D-shaped sway bar bushings and the grease packs.  The picture clearly shows bolts and round bushings, but this kit did not come with it either time it was shipped to me.  It's difficult to define this as anything other than deceptive.
B000FOLXNE|3|It had small rust spots on it when delivered.
B009B9QQ0E|5|Using in Accord 07, fits perfectly. Excellent heat and sunlight protection.
B000CNJNWG|5|Awesome product, good timing!
B0036GNVNI|4|always works good
B001U04NCA|5|Good insurance.
B000W1U0S4|5|It fits my Honda and is a great replacement to the factory shift knob which had worn out. Given that it is just metal I don't think this one will wear out as quickly... I like the feel, surprisingly heavier than I thought it would be. Gets hot on hot days, I had a cheap universal shift knob that was all aluminum which was much worse about that though. I'm not a big fan of bronze, but for $25 it is hard to complain given the quality of the product.
B00GSAUHB8|5|Excellent windshield coverage. Very flexible and easy to use. Does not have to be gently handled.
B008L179WC|5|Pricey for a frame, but great quality in the black middle section and clean look. Worth every penny.
B0031ZDU62|5|exactly what i needed
B000KZ235K|4|I have been using this for some time now, and it has had no problems.  The only thing that I've noticed is that it does not seem to have as much range as the original key fob.
B000NPDL76|5|perfect for the job
B000CMHVGC|3|Have a really hard time putting 7 pin plug in but once in it works fine
B000MMOJUS|3|When I received this item the little decals were both halfway off of the main body. I had to glue them on to make them stay, and even then the plastic film on them is falling off. I really enjoy the extending capabilities, though. Overall a good buy.
B0094GJR3W|4|A little smaller than I expected, But reading a previous review someone said it fell apart on them. Trust me, they fixed that issue, lots resin or epoxy. Used on my lawn tractor instead of the fram filter. Smells very rubbery, don't keep it in your house.
B007K8V2I4|3|Works good so far. Only used about a day on my ATV. Would have liked it if it was sealed. This is NOT a outdoor use Tach. Not sealed in anyway. I suggest to use conformal coating for RTV sealant inside carefully if planning on using outdoors such as on a ATV.<br /><br />The designers of this product could have also used the ROM on the MCU for remembering the last saved color instead of having a complete other wire to run directly to the battery to keep the color setting saved when you turn it on with the switched wire. This was a HUGE engineering fail. Now I have ANOTHER wire to route along with the ground/power/tach/lights. PLUS now I have a small drain on my battery when the machine is off 24/7!! This is a terrible design.<br /><br />Overall the tach runs perfect. Can be used on 1-8 cylinders and registers the rpm perfectly using a digital stepper motor (like on most cars today, very precise and consistent measurement - Needle does not jump around.)
B00X94M4HG|5|Not cheap, but made with good quality materials and good adhesive.
B009ZXCT7U|5|Great stuff, and not as expensive as what furniture stores sell
B0048EFTT6|5|Looks great.  I like the fabric.  No need to use the included 2-sided tape.
B0040CRTK8|5|Works great on the door panels on my '98 XJ.
B006ZCN24S|5|Shipping was fast and product was correct
B00BLZ93T2|5|When I first opened it I figured I was in way over my head but thanks to all the info out there I got it all figured out and it is turning on an LED light in a remote off grid location.  You power the relay via the small two prongs next to the photo wire.  I made a connector by cutting a four wire connector I found in half.  The three screws on the blue block are the three contacts of the SPDT relay.  As shipped, you supply the power to the middle screw. If you install the small jumper that is located next to the blue box, the positive from the relay power input is connected to the middle screw and that way will also power your load.  The screw on the green light side is on when there is no light. The other screw is on when there is light. This unit is very flexible.  The tiny box with the screw in the center adjusts the sensitivity.  The brief chatter during turn on is not an issue for me.
B000GGOOZK|5|I rode facing a setting sun for about 30 minutes and the visor blocked the sun very well, I didn't need to squint my eyes or anything. The real surprise was the return journey, because I hardly lost any visibility at night. This is a very convenient feature if you end up out late without a clear backup stashed away somewhere. This particular color variation does fit the CL-17 helmet and comes with the pin lock built in.
B007JMTSTQ|3|fits good -i put a water sealant on it and it still faded
B003VAT976|5|Works great if your camper already has a gas line.Now we don't need to carry along abunch of those small green cylinders for grill gas. You just hook grill to line and line to auxiliary line on camper. It comes with a regulator too.
B00GSAUHB8|4|It's a OK product, does the job. Time will tell how durable it is. The only complaint: it does not like to stay up and keeps falling, but maybe it's our cars' fault.
B008G3KG70|5|High quality product at a very favorable price.  I should have done this years ago!
B006OZF6PY|5|Great mounts for cart.
B00KTHVHLA|1|It was supposed to be for my year model it was obviously different year cause it was different size and  would not fit mine (not even close ) so I threw it in garbage cause that's pretty much what was
B0009EUA0M|5|Wife loves it.
B005644G7I|5|perfect fit
B00IV7BBNY|5|perfect replacement part
B003YDOLX2|5|Beautiful helmet, protects well, the quality is excellent ... I recommend it.
B001JT3QF2|1|Does not compare to wilson super flex you can bend a wilson superflex in half
B0031HEIDY|1|Wrong connection for my daughters 2004 Toyota Camry. Now it's too late to return.
B000KZ278I|3|Very difficult to program
B004IAB4DK|2|Will not work (not matable) with Blue Sea / Contura brackets.
B0000AY1W7|5|It been on outdoor furniture since spring.  Works great & will use on additional furniture when needed. Highly recommend.
B0016HPU88|5|Worked perfectly. Easy to install.
B0034BRH76|5|Looks and works like original honda starter. 20 minutes and a happy wife again.
B0030CC2XI|5|Fits and looks great!
B00Q3CNRU4|5|So cute
B007A8LGVC|5|I run RK 520's on both of my R1's and on my Husky 510SM. Very durable.
B000C04X8I|5|great OE part for half the price of OEM BMW part
B0073JDIFK|5|As described.
B00029XGYG|5|I bought this as a gift for a relative of mine. He has it wired on a separate horn switch so he can use the Ooogah horn or his normal horn. It is loud and gets a lot of comments!
B00A2YTJZQ|1|Doesn't fit
B000OV4LSW|5|Works just like a factory solenoid
B004I12424|5|Came on time and in one piece
B00F22M5PO|5|A very well made product looks beautiful. Is everything I wanted great coloring. Fits perfectly. I almost couldn't decide whether to put on my car or hang it up in my  house. Great product for the price I would definitely recommend
B009DIVZUE|5|Excellent quality, just like a K&N for less than half the price.
B00BITHTW4|5|very nice product
B009YN13CS|5|Windshield is awesome and got it earlier then estimated went on fast looks great
B00QN91WO0|1|This is for a honda...
B000NWJJLG|5|Gets the windshield nice and clean and doesnt leave any streaks. Also alows the rain and water to bead up and not smear. Its lasting a while, i put it on maybe a month ago and have not had to reapply yet. I coupled it with brand new windshield wipers and my vision from the driver seat is wonderful!!
B000CB4Y40|5|This part matched up exactly with the old OEM part I pulled off my 2000 ES300. Instillation is easy if you can knock the old tie rod out. The construction of the tie rod seems to be good quality!
B00G4ATR54|5|This product functions very well.
B00KO5VKWS|5|Replaced my bent one and worked great.
B0033DIUYE|5|Super fine
B003U92EZM|5|Best money I've spent on an exhaust! My 2002 Tahoe with a 5.3L sounds awesome! Easy install, took about an hour and looks clean. Very deep mellow sound, and the cabin noise isn't bad at all especially at highway speeds. When you get up on it that thing turns heads!
B000HEBR3I|5|bought one several years ago works great.recent storm caused no electric for several days and used it to fill generator. neighbors liked so much ordered one for four of them
B003YLIHT8|5|Perfect fit for 2002 Dakota fixed my no high on fan problem
B00HW1IQD8|5|Looks awesome
B00KJGPQP4|3|Never got my item but my buddy has the same camera he bought else where.  Issues he told me about and ive seen when we ride together- battery life sucks! connecting and staying connected to sena 20s bluetooth headset sucks Mic cuts in and out on the bluetooth on video. Few of the features dont want to work right! They need to do a huge bug fix!
B00H8DQVDM|5|Perfect, all in working order!
B00KL27PQO|4|That is an excellent sunshade protector but it's not easy to fold after use it!!!!
B00IUE5OAO|5|Good stuff!!!!
B00LG6GIQC|5|These mats fit perfectly in my Toyota Tacoma and I'd recommend them to anyone who needs a heavy duty floor mat! They've been easy to clean and I can just use a water hose with the pressure sprayer on it for any mud. Amazon was great with making sure these fit my model/year truck as well. If you have kids that make any kind of mess or are always in and out of your vehicle with sand, mud, etc then these would be a great purchase for you! Although I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my unbiased and honest review, I will be purchasing another set for our other truck and recommending these to my friends and family for sure!
B001P482AK|5|SO CUTE. I  LOVED IT.
B00A40WDNI|3|The product is good quality, however the 3m tape supplied does nothing for holding this in place, very thin. without anything securing it , it rattles. I had to use heavy duty velcro in order to secure the plate in place. Manufacture needs to come up with a better way of securing plate.
B0014FM6YS|5|Fit perfect
B001650QPC|1|Cheaply madeand  shoddy quality control.  Should have cost $5 not  $20.
B00JTTJIGA|5|Look great on the back of my gold wing .<br />Flat will not lay flush on slight curves
B000BZG96I|5|OEM,and lots cheaper than the dealership
B00B2AFKKM|5|What I wanted and what I needed
B003JTYGPO|5|Great customer service,  great product...would definitely shop again.  Thanks!
B000ABCHKU|1|Did not help with a small leak at all. Lucas Oil product did help.
B002UKY63U|5|As descriibed. A okay.
B004IARSFI|5|Glad to order and receive a pack of 8 washers, enough for the front and rear shackles.
B00QFY2BCK|5|They clear up the headlights remarkably well, but don't expect the protection to last. It is however incredibly cheap solution that can be periodically done before a full sanding restoration.
B00LIE73HA|4|Mounting bolts would have been nice.
B00AN5SDMY|5|Great set of brakes at a great price. Had one issue where a caliper bolt worked it's way out and got lost, but can't blame the kit for that. I got a replacement bolt and used some thread locker on it.
B00B77RMCE|5|This fender eliminator kit was easy to install and exceeded my expectations. It looks great especially compared to the bulky stock fender.
B00CMFF1AA|5|A+
B0031XXW4O|3|It seems very heavy for what it has to do.  I would think an aluminum one would be better, not corrode and lighter.  It does extend the shower area and did fit without much adjustment.
B007TY06JA|5|good
B001AWDV8A|5|Nice fit
B003RVT35W|5|Great product that exceeded my expectations.
B001JT5JAM|5|Works great
B0066QQPHE|5|Very quick shipping and amazing quality!
B008L0GCIK|5|Exactly what you need for replacement parts
B00KJAPQKA|1|Didn't last one day
B00CXBA9KA|5|Works great in my RV!
B004RNR9QY|5|I love it! It's definitely the best hose I've used for my horse barn.
B00FQ0ROZS|2|The light output is terrible.
B009G4Y9RG|5|So far working as designed...
B00BTLEIIY|5|Great fit
B0055PD1H4|5|Works very well!
B00QVUI2JY|5|Great item to have in the car. It has everything needed incase of an emergency. its compact and has it well organized
B00HJAYPQY|5|Just what I needed.
B004QQCEO4|1|I was in a hurry to get my older refrigerator back up and running. This unit did not perform well at all. I had a professional come to put the refrigerant in,so I wouldn't make a mess, or leak any into the atmosphere. It leaked all over for  him as well. Do not buy this set-up.
B00ZS9RWZE|2|AWEFULLY SMALL FOR PRICE PAID. NOW THAT I'M VOTING FOR HIM [IF HE STAYS IN THE RACE] I SURE WOULD LIKE ONE MUCH MUCH BIGGER BUT AT A FAIR PRICE.
B004BSS5KY|5|Great product.. quality piece..
B00R6RQ9B4|5|Fit correctly and easy to install.  Thanks!
B000C9SJUC|5|works great !! fast shipping
B00EHM0FU2|5|Easy to use! Looks great on my car!
B00LCFHKCS|5|Nice item for the money
B00CPGQ1GO|5|Works great!
B00CAYECNU|4|Time will tell, but they work fine Only concern is I had to reload to 0.140 to get them to be quiet. at 0.125 they were clattering.
B000C7ZXTY|4|Its fine
B00EIRAB78|5|It keeps the sun light off the dash
B0019O1BS6|5|Good!
B006FUT0CS|5|With the drought, I figured I'd look into alternatives for washing my car.  I was skeptical about a waterless wash, but WOW this stuff works amazing.  It even takes off bug guts.
B00E7G4AEA|5|A nice sticker for the price.  After several moths it shows no sign of pealing and was easy to put on.
B007PAHHWM|5|Cord works great!  Perfect for moving the reader to somewhere it won't stick out far and bang your knees.  I moved mine between the seat and center console so it's out of sight completely.
B005SJ7IBM|5|We love the license plate frame.  We bought three for our three Supras. :). Thank you.
B004XG3PEA|5|Works great!  Just needed this to come with tire bumper extensions.
B00B7TQHQ4|4|Just as advertised
B00WFSGHAM|5|extension cable works great
B000P5B8HO|5|Cams went above and beyond my expectations. Truck now runs and sounds amazing. They say that computer modification is required, with that being said the truck will run and drive when you first install it but to take full advantage of it you must get it tuned. But it will drive until then.
B003RWVX9K|4|Works great, I had to go online to find better directions how to sync...
B000CGT2CY|5|Great product. Quiet operation. Lower dusting than manufacturer pad. Close to same bite. Far superior for the price.
B000KOW676|5|Works as expected and replace last list cap. Wish there was a cheaper replacement or better- a floating gas cap.
B004YHR4D6|2|too small for Explorer bucket seats but was not clear in the review
B005FRHHRM|3|Had trouble figuring out how to put back seat covers on and there were no head rest covers for the back seat.. My only upsets about this products.<br /><br />I think it needs better directions..
B004BFW0EO|2|Did not work on automotive glass with water spots.  After an hour of effort on the windshield no noticeable difference.  Returned product for refund.
B005EVBSZQ|1|Item for sale is not the same item you receive.
B00TUQCG3E|5|Really great product, it did not fit my vehicle but the buyer did an excellent job in trying to find one in their stocked items to fit my engine. Would definitely recommend them!
B00VIVITHG|5|Excellent item and fast delivery. Everything lined up perfect and looks new again.
B007XE8C74|5|Very easy to use. Just plug it in and go. Color screen is nice.
B000ESBLW4|5|fit and works great
B00SI6NPS2|5|very good rate 5 star
B00JYMZ8HK|4|Protects the converter in my travel trailer, very needed purchase.
B000C9JSBG|5|excellent
B00DR14AQ4|5|very good product, perfect fit
B00PZ5ZN2K|5|Made a lovely gift.
B00XJ0WAN8|1|product has no quality at all..when installed right side lamp wont accept car electrical socket some tab not cut...left side lamp led bulb busted....averall the bulb body is too HOT u cant touch it..fitting ,u have to cut door cover to accomodate the body.
B001O7PNS2|5|I like this, a little goes a log way, it is so easy to use and leaves a nice wet look. Seems to last about a month or so.
B000CB0V06|5|Looks great arrived quick, gotta love Prime!
B008427D88|5|These and cable ties, so simple to use and work great
B009TALNSU|5|These were made of high quality material and fit my 2011 Subaru Legacy perfectly. I am glad I got them instead of replacing the carpets.<br />Update - Lasted 2 years. To replace these, I decided to get weather tech rather than these. Weather tech is much better - better fit, more durable than this.
B0085KTS2I|5|Works great easy to install
B00F12RAHS|1|They look great but the lights are way to dim. They probably ain't even street legal if you ask me.
B00SCCCCPO|5|Quick shipping and an extra sticker was included. Thank you!
B000L9AD2K|5|i like it
B0016515DE|2|These should be fine on the LOWER &#34;A&#34; arms.  The title to this ad states &#34;Upper/Lower&#34;.  This kit is for the LOWER &#34;A&#34; arm ONLY...no &#34;and/or&#34;  !!!  Naturally, I really needed the upper bushings. Had the ad been clear, I wouldn't be in a clinch before caribou season.

B00SZ70TP6|5|This are perfect and easy to put on
B000BUTD9I|5|Product does what was expected. We used it during a very rainy camping weekend and it did keep the area in front of out camper much cleaner which is great with kids and dogs. Definitely worth the money!
B000E794VK|5|A perfect decoration and the paint job is well done.  People have asked if it was real...ok so they have never looked at a real coupler close up.  Still fun.
B005MZV2W8|5|Looks great on the car. Love it. 5 star seller. HIGHLY recommended!!!!!!!

B000LY9IIA|4|I have just finished installing one on my 2015 Toyota Tacoma TRD off-road and other than the instructions being a little off.also my truck has an aluminum skid plate that had to be trimmed but no real problems..l really love it..
B0080C7HC4|5|great item fast shipper.
B00AM1SAL8|2|Fast delivery but the item was not in exact fit into my toyota corolla xrs. It was a little bit short and can't align in the sides of the doors.
B00R1LP17S|5|Just got through using my new air compressor and it was great! Very easy to use and follow instructions, relatively quiet for an air compressor.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Easy to use<br />-Programmable<br />-Auto Shut-off<br />-Stays in place and does not move around<br />-Power cord is long enough for one side of car<br />-Reads pressure in tire before beginning to put air in, VERY helpful to know how low a tire is before putting air into it.<br />-LED (not LCD) pressure readout for easy display in both low and bright lighting conditions.<br />-Carry case makes it easy to transport<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Gets pretty hot at plug-in site (I was filling all 4 tires so the excessive use may have generated heat).<br />-Goes over set tire pressure before shutting off. Recommend setting 1 PSI below desired output in order to achieve correct pressure.<br />-Screw-on stem pipe is not as good as a clamp-on stem pipe<br />-Does not have an option for AC use (household current)<br /><br />Overall I would recommend this compressor for short-term air compression, otherwise the heat will build up around plug-in site as well as on the compressor. The Owner's Manual does state to only use for 10 minutes at a time and allow at least 10 minutes to cool after use.<br />I was very happy with this purchase and think you will be too! Good quality for the money.
B005GHPLCO|4|I ordered these and received them with no issue - unfortunately, I ordered the wrong color. :(  I wanted the almost black - part# PT208-42051-11.  Note that each color is listed as a different item on Amazon, so you'll have to search for the part # to get the other colors.<br /><br />However, the floor mats look great, are shaped just right for the floor pan, and have the right kind of retention clips for my Toyota Rav4. I consider this product a WIN!  I simply wish I'd paid more attention to the item when I ordered it.
B00062Z2TG|5|nice
B001TY6RXU|4|Good information. Quality of print a little sketchy.
B002724TA6|5|Fits and is easy to install. excellent in the bright sun.
B00HH8KLMA|1|Not happy with it , they turn yellow after a while
B004JB0PPQ|5|Exact replacement.  Worked well
B00DI1X5S2|5|Works as advertised, simple and effective.
B008Y9BWE2|5|great
B0000AZ81O|4|Yes
B00OXWZ60A|1|This DOES NOT FIT the 2005-2014 Ford MUSTANG GT. Amazon's fitment guide reported that it was compatible with this car. The space for the vehicle's oxygen sensor has no remaining space to allow this product to fit properly. Do not buy this if you have a 2005 to 2014 Ford Mustang GT (V8). It's too late for me to return it but it's not to late for you to avoid buying it. I hope this helps.
B00KCQSOAA|3|they are ok just what I paid for. didn't have money for the real good ones that are made for my jeep, but these will do for now.<br />they did come in pretty quick.
B00NPIYDWU|2|For the product. Its good, bright for back up/reverse lights but i tried it for my brake lights, but the stock is much much brighter when you push the brake peds. Only difference is the LED is bright when its steady
B0016C3STQ|5|Great kit for towing. Included everything pictured.
B00252E782|5|As discribed, quick delivery
B001AWGE5W|3|Cover worked fine however it came with no bolt. From what I understand it should have. I had to go buy one.
B00QKJFS3Y|1|Didn't bolt up wholes on two of the pipes dont line up at all
B00429NKWK|4|Better than I've stuff I used before....Just my lights may have been to foggy to long, they are better than before. Wished I'd used it sooner....
B0009NUG66|4|This might be a little early since I've only used this product one time. Took it to Michigan with all of our baggage loaded in. Went through at least one significant storm and ran into some other rain. No problems. Easy to load and everything was dry when we got home.
B00192MU2Y|5|i was very happy with the quality and price with the replacement plug
B00NG7706G|2|When received,I found the headsets of average quality. Good Audio Clarity. The Biggest Problem I had was that the 2 units wouldn't stay Paired. You would have to have them search for each other each time you went to use them. Big Headache!  I Returned them!
B002801Z7W|4|No problems!  Great locks that look good!
B000TM7HXC|5|Been awhile since this purchase since I don't shop Amazon often, but its still working accurate within specified +/- tolerances under low to moderate use  years after the purchase. I'd buy another since I don't need extremely accurate readings.
B00QW2JSBW|5|Good fit and finish. Dye has not come off on hands. Orange flames are bright and we'll done. Gotten many compliments. :)
B00SPYTINI|3|When the pump arrived it looked like it would be a quick replacement job, but.... I took the old one out, removed the rubber mounts and tried to install them on the new pump. That's when the 5 star rating went downhill. The rubber mounts only screwed in half way and when I tried to turn it with a wrench the metal separated from the rubber on the mount. I tried all the bolt holes and none of the three had been drilled out enough to let the bolt of the rubber mount screw in flush. I drilled out the excess plastic and the bolt still would not sit flush. It was still a full 3 threads from flush on all 3 holes. I found what thread size the bolts were and tapped the 3 holes. After tapping the holes the bolts fit flush. So, that 10 minute job turned into 1 1/2 hours. I would not recommend this pump unless you are prepared to re-engineer the simplest parts. The pump does work and that is the reason for 3 stars and not 1.
B00SCXCQV8|5|INCREDIBLE LIGHTS!! These are great. Like most LED lights they put off a very white (600-650K range) light. With the 60 degree design they work very well as flood/work lights. Another benefit, being LED they have a small drain range unlike the usual 65-100 watt lights.<br /> The cases are cast metal with a well built, sturdy design. I can not comment yet on how long they will last but it should be for quite some time.<br />Highly recommended.
B00NLN8H4Y|5|Great Corner Guards! One of my favorite mods done to my 2005 Wangler X, they are super easy to fit and the final look is outstanding, and they look very well with the ARB side protection. Makes your rear end real tough and resistant to scratches or hits during trails. would highly recommend! Only regret that Barricade is not making them for the front, will be real nice.
B0072KRVH6|5|Looks great!
B0046U4YPM|1|Alignment pin on the mount that fits into receiver  was not in the correct location. Put the old one back in and  sent the new one back for a refund.
B0035533S8|5|I love them. Got them and have used them many times already since a month ago. Excellent tool to have for a mechanic or do it yourself. Very good quality and easy to use. You got you money worth in no time. You will  use them very often.
B000C5DUN2|5|Perfect replacement for my Explorer.  Works great.
B00IMVK08G|5|I have mostly used the gray visor but have found that it not only protects your eyes from strain, but when driving into the sun it also helps to keep your body cool. Areas of my shirt that were not protected by the sun shield were noticeably warmer than the part in the shade of the visor. It fits nicely on my '08 Ford Explorer. Much better than just using sunglasses and if needed you can still use your sunglasses for additional sun and glare protection. I can put my car visor down and extend this visor below it for additional sun protection.
B0016HUQZU|5|I bought this for my 1999 Chevy Tahoe because I was having increasingly frequent Passlock failures (engine starts but immediately shuts down).  Since I installed it my car starts reliably so I've concluded that this was the problem.  I think there are other component failures that can cause this problem but in my case, this seems to have solved it. There are some Youtube videos that show how to replace it and if you are willing to drill a small hole in the steering column shroud it is very easy.
B00IEYEANM|1|Layer

B00VF7HZF0|4|LOOKED AND WORKED AS CLAIMED.
B0002U1TVW|5|As advertised
B00BV5JYI2|5|Over three hundred miles in +80dC, straight out of the bag! Great pair of gloves, perfect biking gloves for dry climate.
B007NKIRQ4|4|It worked like ti was supposed to and was priced right but took a little longer than I expected to receive it
B0007OS6V4|5|Easy install and fits perfectly.
B004JBUECK|1|Didn't fit my car
B0085BI42M|3|Gaerne doesn't cover the straps under warranty and the ones on these are not sturdy. The male toe strap on mine broke after only 10 months from fatigue. I called the manufacturer and they wanted $10 to replace it. Also, there's no padding where the shifter meets the toe. Not much better protection than a sneaker.
B00DI3DV6G|5|Nice front seat/trunk organizer.
B00A71MPRI|5|Perfect exactly what I was looking for. The people who say they can't get the security part in. That's a aiming issue
B006B376WK|5|This product is awesome! The more you use it, the better it works. Serves well on those days when you just don't have enough time to wash the car but using this has been great for getting dust and rain smears off, especially if you regularly wax your car. Great Price!
B00877SL2M|5|Bright as I wanted!
B00514B34C|5|Harness works perfectly.  Switch blends in well.
B008H2IUIC|4|currently trying to find out exactly' which gas cap it does take.I was able to speak someone and the issue should be resolved soon.?
B000L9PB2C|4|I'm rating the Weather Tech based on construction. I have to return these.  Though they are advertised to fit a Miata they do not. They are general fit for a variety of vehicles, but to long for the Miata. The driver's side bunches up under the driver's seat.<br />Construction is substantial. Thick. Solid. Typical for Weather Tech. More robust than two cheap mats put together.<br />I can recommend these, just make sure they fit your vehicle.
B00O8RWKCM|5|good irons
B000CFCVJ6|3|watch cardone rebuilt anything....not what they used to be..this wasn't assembled correctly and sent it back .got a boneyard unit that is still on the road.gave 3 stars because of amazons no hassle return policy.
B007VTSN52|5|This stuff is great, it sprays nice. I used a 1.7mm Harbor Freight gun to metal prep my vintage motorcycle project. Expect to work hard mixing it though its kind of like mixing up a jar of natural peanut butter when all the solids settle to the bottom.
B00C5IHO7C|5|great item fast shipper.
B00FWG6CPE|5|ADDS A NICE TOUCH
B000QGZXCS|5|This is the product you know and love. It lasts forever
B00TUNSOMO|4|I used this on my kayak to make them easier to clean and protect them from the degrading UV. One other reviewer commented on the application and the uniformity. I didn't have much of an issue once you've gotten a little on the microfiber because it seems to spread pretty well then. As I do with all of my other waxes, I used my Porter Cable Orbital with a microfiber over a pad for removal of the haze. I found that this tends to work really well.<br /><br />The wax does help when it comes time to pull out the kayaks also and get rid of the mud which you pick up from your shoes. It sprays right off much easier. I can't comment on the 30 day lifecycle yet, but that seems rather short. With that said, a kayak is going to get a lot of &#34;use&#34; for the wax with bodies sliding around on the surfaces, being dragged and so on, so I wouldn't expect much more.
B00DNPH052|5|nice
B006TMMMEK|5|Excellent price and fast delivery.  Excellent quality.
B00B51XW26|5|I've inquired for the color code# 040 (Toyota Color Code Super White). The answer is, they don't have the color code I wanted for this item. I read and analyze their product description &#34;  Dodge Charger Spoiler Painted in the Factory Paint Code of Your Choice 501 PW7 &#34; (Bright White). The color of this item equals the Toyota Paint Code# 040 Super White. I've installed this item on my 2013 Tacoma Tonneau Truck Bed Cover and, Voila!!! What a beauty. Perfect Color Matched and, Tonneau width top.
B000WP8QV8|5|Perfect
B00NMX1OSO|4|It looks good. It was bigger than what I expected. Not an ideal if you're looking for something to go in your pocket. Not ideal for motorcycle keys.
B000HACYNY|5|I have a few of these so I am never without one.  This is a very straight forward product and VERY sturdy, i recommend it.
B00EI26VDG|5|My LED headquarters!!!! No problems and they are awesome!!!!! Bright as heck!
B000N3W8J0|5|If you wash your own car, get one of these.<br /><br />Awesome product.
B00KC4LWD8|5|Was just like the OEM unit I removed.
B00L9OYPLG|5|It's totally Cool, People... it really makes a statement to Crazy Drivers. =-) Njoy.
B000E0Z85I|5|Installed all three main components plus the LP line and it blows smoking cold.  You have to have a pressure and vacuum no matter what.  your system will not work.  Parts are easy to install if you have tools and time on many cars, so that can save you even more money.  I bought the compressor the condenser and the accumulator plus a new LP line and then took it to the shop for $90 and had it all sealed and checked and finally golden.
B00D8IDTEA|3|It does work and my brother got a kick out of it - it was part of a gag present for his 40th birthday and he is a firefighter. Shipping was reasonable. However I was disappointed that it was listed as new but the metal clamp for the button was tarnished and looked old and used. Part of the light was cracked and a small piece was broke off. Thankfully it still went together and worked. It was difficult to get the batteries in and I ended up modifying the metal clips to get them in. It did not seem in new condition at all. Thankfully the price was low and it was only a gag gift. Otherwise I would be more disappointed.
B0019BSGTQ|5|Looks great
B000WD6ALI|5|No longer have the car i bought this for but while it was on my celica for a year it was GREAT Invidia has earned my loyalty for sure! They make some very solid pipes for cars! 10/10!!!!
B000BLNTQU|3|This is not the correct size for my 2009 Toyota Corolla. They are much smaller despite the &#34;This fits your vehicle&#34; part compatibility checker. I am not sure if that is Amazon's fault or Sylvania's. Going to Auto Zone to pick up correct part before I get a ticket for having a tail light out. Not pleased.  Update: Changing review from 1 star to 3 stars due to amazing customer service from amazon. Got a refund and correct part ordered in under 10 minutes. The product itself is probably good quality, but do not trust the compatibility checker, which  I assume is an Amazon program. Check an OEM parts index prior to purchase.
B0091Q3NCG|4|works like a charm
B00U3FTRBA|4|I just received these bumpers today and installed them. Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because there were no instructions included but it was easy enough to figure out, also the side plates for the rear bumper were a little tricky to position and thread the bolts into.<br /><br />all in all I would definitely purchase these again.
B0026JK8FK|5|Used in a 2007 Accord. I didnt notice any changes, but i didnt have any shifting issues.  Ive own many hondas in my days and i would only use honda fluids for everything, i only tried this due to all the good things on the forums i visit.
B000EDUUG2|5|Does what it is designed to do.  Must have for your RV.  Handy telescoping handle for easy stowage.
B00K7VE2VK|5|Excellent product, very easy to use and at a great price.
B009PF894K|5|These fit my 2004 Dodge Viper perfectly.  They emailed me an installation video, and gave me a business card with the video webpage, with the product.  I could have had one of these replace the two on my trunk lid, but installed both anyhow.  Great product. Well done!
B009EU5ZMK|5|Does as specified.
B007OW6M0Y|4|Good Product!
B00K6498D0|5|Good
B00NLUU1SC|5|Excellent!
B002YBKTRC|5|Good size and the metalic look really stands out on my black truck.
B0002JN2UO|1|Does not work! Leaves discoloration!
B00L888TVA|5|nice quality
B008J52L32|5|This power bleeder adapter is labeled as a black label for Ford adapter, but I ordered it for my 03' Infinity FX35 after searching the manufacturer's web site for compatibility.  Tested it today for air seal.  Initially I had a hard time to screw it onto the brake fluid master cylinder.  It wouldn't click onto the three tabs on the neck of the brake fluid jar.  I thought I got the wrong product.  Later I pressed the adapter cap down really hard, and felt the adapter squeezed inside the opening of the brake fluid jar, and then turned the cap to screw it on.  the way I pressed the adapter cap down gave me a feel of almost like pressing a push pin type of screw.  Needless to say that it has an excellent air seal after I pumped up the air pressure of the motive power bleeder to 15 psi.
B00F8X1XBE|3|Trunk lid emblem did not contour correctly with metal on the body.
B00QU6P47M|1|Ripp off, wrong size, wrong car. Doesn't fit! Refund reply has been short and sweet,(meaning none). Negative stars .
B002UXBELY|3|Light spread could be better. Also not a white as I was hoping. Still pretty yellow.
B006FUT0CS|5|I bought this product and I could I not bought anything better. Especially meguiars! I've tired other water-less products but does not do the same as this one. I own a black car and this stuff will not do damage if you use it properly. Make sure to use more than 1 micofiber while using this product. Other than that this stuff makes it look like you actually used water n soap to clean your car!
B000C560KC|4|They work
B010H0QV7S|5|The unit is a 5 in 1 tool, including a digital pressure gauge with backlight display, flashlight, LED light, seatbelt cutter, and emergency glass breaking tool. Any one of these items is a must for your car, but all five in one easy-to-hold tool is great.<br /><br />The instructions say the tire gauge is accurate to 1 psi. I used it the other day to inflate one of my tires on my 2015 Nissan. My car has an automatic tire pressure readout and when I added air and checked it with my 5 in 1 tool the pressure was the same as  that of the on-board pressure indicator.<br /><br />I have seen a lot of coverage on TV about people leaving pets and even children in locked cars where the temperature goes well beyond the safety range.  I'm glad to have the emergency glass breaking tool in case I ever observe one of those situations.<br /><br />This is a great addition to anyone's glove compartment even though you may never use more than the pressure gauge and lights<br /><br />Sample provided at a reduced price for review.
B00876CRX2|5|Perfect fit
B00JGJH8QU|5|Its just what I wanted, simple, clean , not complicated. It works great and is a good value for the money.
B00M8UHSX2|5|These things are amazing... Nice heavy duty metal, so you don't have to worry about them bending.
B00E9P9A4O|5|Awesome tool to have.  Does amazing things
B00E3BRVFY|4|Good replacement
B0049VZN8U|5|Fits great, heavy duty!
B0051N0QIC|4|Smells good, wish it last longer
B001CKOA2Q|5|Its shocking how awesome this sticker is
B004SRRP2W|1|TYC doesn't make a quality alternator.  Their warranty is also a HUGE hassle.  I would suggest another company and spend the extra 20-50 dollars and not have to replace it again.
B00MUP687W|5|My 98 civic hatch dx kept killing at red lights and had a really rough idle. I cleaned out my intake manifold and my old iacv and it didn't help. Since the problem only occurred when my car was warm I knew my iacv was faulty. This one did the trick finally. I had to take off my throttle body to install it. This one is a third of the price of the other ones I found and worked well. Thanks!!  If this review was helpful, please click the yes button below.
B005JDSSP2|1|Metal caps are bad news as they corrode on stems.....don't buy!
B00K7VE2VK|5|Good product.
B000FPYEUC|5|Only way to go
B001AVSIOI|4|works good
B00O3GNURM|5|Very useful, but it won't stay tucked to the carpet (not enough velcro I guess). Also I only use it for paper, so I couldn't say if it is really waterproof.
B00H4CY9TK|5|Love these, but don't roll window down while driving, I lost one on the highway.  I will reorder for next Christmas season though!
B00029WYVW|4|Cleaned up the filter on my FIPK with no real problems.  I know some people say the drip bottle is more accurate, but I think I will get the spray can next time since I have a conical filter.  It was pretty wild seeing how much dirt came out of the filter.
B0013LH7RE|5|Please read this edited review!   Pack the bag before cinching down the side straps! I know this sounds like a no-brainier, but after reading many reviews (including my own,) that many of us are outright using this pack incorrectly. Like everyone else, I was disappointed with the volume of this bag. I once even had to abandon a tarp I couldn't get back into the bag. After that trip, I cut all the sub-dividing fabric out from the inside of the bag to create one large compartment. Opening the inside of the bag helped some, but I was still underwhelmed.   I took the bag off my bike and there it sat in my garage for months. Yesterday I picked up a new daypack, and checked to see if it fit in the Navigator. I was surprised to see how much room there was left in the bag, so I kept going. At this point, I realized that I had been using the bag wrong the whole time! If you're strapping this pack down tight before stuffing it, you're only using about half the space.   I've included pics to show how much stuff can fit in this cavernous bag:  Armored 1pc. Riding suit Rain suit Hammock Sleeping bag Underquilt  XL motorcycle cover Water filter Liter water bottle Chain lube Camp axe/machete  6x9 tarp Inflatable sleeping pad Mess kit/stove  Toiletries  Day pack  pack cover Pillow (!) Extra shoes Misc. camp tools Molle pouch Rope  I've never had to actually bring this much crap camping, and still had room in the bag. If you need more room for a 3 day ride, you should probably sell your motorcycle and buy a pickup truck.    [Doesn't do much for you that strapping a camping backpack onto your bike won't do; however, what's nice about this pack is that it straps down from the bottom, so you can access your pack without unstrapping it from your bike. This is nice if you're taking a short break, or camping somewhere you'll need to get out of in a hurry. Gears badge is kind of hokey and I easily removed it with a pocket knife. To all those complaining about the shock cord, simply doubleit up and it works great. To all those complaining about capacity, I'd encourage you to take advantage of its flat top to strap a second bag on top of it, though I could probably tour all summer with this pack alone.]
B00C5TDEO8|5|Great filter!
B004BYX8W8|5|So far has worked great and fixed the problem nicely.price was good as well
B004QEH1US|5|Works as expected
B000CF6I40|5|Easy install, fit great! Price was excellent
B00DOL39F0|5|Game-tight! 5*****
B00SQT3A5E|5|love it!!
B0002ILK6I|5|This battery has enough juice to fix the hot start/slow crank problem the slant K's tend to have. The stock gel cell couldn't deliver enough power to crank the motor when the hot start compression issue would happen.
B00AZ4R9FK|1|Horrible product and horrible customer service! Front guards didn't fully stick on and rear guards even long enough! When I contacted the company, they told me to pour rubbing alcohol on my car to get them off and that the rear rain guards aren't supposed to fully cover the window. After a frustrating phone call with them where the CSR acted like he didn't care, I ended up contacting Amazon directly. Once again, horrible products and even worse customer service!
B00ZGIIM6U|5|It was perfect.  My husband was very pleased.  Thanks:)
B004ULXMCS|5|Excellent results cleaning and protecting, the seats look new!
B005GRAI86|5|Came with everything needed and clear instructions with labeled packages. They made it easy to find the prices you need.

B001G77WRU|5|yes
B000EDUTX6|5|Just what we were expecting!
B00B5NPL7I|4|Work great, but not too bright.

B0014B5YFK|4|Fits well and priced right.
B005CO9MDA|5|Great product came fast.
B00MJAOFKA|5|I was able to install these in a few hours with no problems, no drilling, with minor trimming of the plastic underbody to make room for the support. Very simple with a multitool.
B00JG74H20|5|Awesome wheel well liners. Easy to install. The exhaust pipe was the only problem to work around.
B000C5G93K|5|180 degrees.. couldnt expect more :)
B00JQYOAVG|5|Works great!
B0012BL8LG|5|Works as advertised
B0094IFFMC|4|Good
B0049IZSS8|5|It works great. N0 wobble.
B001V8U12M|5|The Only way to run the stabilizer jacks up and down!
B00HUZ2VCI|5|Worked perfectly as a replacement for lost cup holders for my sofas sectional. Make sure they are the right size for you.
B00QGJGP5I|1|One of the two I ordered came broken in the box.  The one good one was not designed for a Suberau Outback as the hooks to attach to the headrest were to close together.<br /><br />I returned both.  However, They only recorded one return and so are in the process of billing me for a unit that I did not receive.
B00CM5863E|5|Works very well with no residue
B00TKO0J6C|5|Nice lights for the price. I wanted silver and though they were silver but, came in and are white no big deal after up in our boat they look nice. The old fixture were gross and ugly so anything would be an improvement. Lines on the new lights are clean and looks so much better. Lights came in a bubble envelope not in a box I was surprised they weren't broken. Lastly, these are not glass they are light plastic which makes since they go in a RV or a Boat it would be safer.
B00AEK55WY|5|They look great. I have them under the dash and and under the wheel wells
B0002U1TYY|5|This step cleans up some of those pesky swirl marks, SOME, not all. Do no think this is a miracle sure to clear your car of all swirl marks, but it does a pretty good job &#34;sealing&#34; them.
B00B0C1VK0|5|Really was pleased even though I had to return first set . Didn't have to wait long at all for replacement. Look great on my car and also work great
B004DZ31S6|5|They look good on my 2005 Sportster. Quality seems very good. Had to buy longer bolts and large tie wraps, other than that easy to mount. For the price,can't complain.

B00ACOB4YA|5|For the money, this is a great cover.I have gotten a lot of outdoor use with this cover. It has lasted longest of any other same priced ones I've tried. The fit is wonderful and there are Velcro straps on each corner to help it stay put. This cover has saved me hundreds in garage rental fees, haha!. I  This is my second one and I will buy it again when this one wears out. New Jersey seasons can be brutal on a car cover, this one holds up.

B00008RW9U|5|Great product, was happy with my purchase from this seller
B00DX8B3ZC|4|Good helmet but I would recommend buying a size a little bigger than what you think you need.
B0085F7DUC|3|First of my car is a BMW Z4 E89 2010, this is not exactly like OEM but it will fit. OEM is thicker, squishier and has charcoal lining. This replacement is just a clear fiber/paper filter. You will need to make sure to remove tabs and plastic lining before trying to fit it or it will get in the way. For the cost you may as well just buy OEM discounted. Your health is more important then saving $10/$20.
