B00E5Q1LTY|4.0|The special effects are so 22nd century.  The plot even though familiar, was changed enough so you really didn't know what was going to occur.  I didn't like that Pike had to die, but this is Star Trek and every once in a while some one has got to go.
B00CBT04LI|3.0|First off, lets clear the air here. I've read FAR too many reviewer's call this film a &#34;sub par remake&#34; when it is, in fact, a decent prequel. Anyone whose seen John Carpenters amazing version of &#34;The Thing&#34; will see this immediately. What the filmmakers did wrong was simply call the movie &#34;The Thing&#34;. That is where 99% of the confusion lies. They really should have called it &#34;The Thing From Outer Space&#34; or something like that to help differentiate it.  That being said, I think the film is a very well done prequel (George Lucas could definitely take some notes on this), although the story is flawed and the continuity between this film and the 1982 source material is not always 100% correct, it is  still a fun exploration of the events that unfolded at the Norwegian camp prior to the Husky escaping and making its way to the U.S Research Post NOR 31 in Carpenter's film. The film begins with the discovery of the creature buried in the ice by a Norwegian research camp and the hush-hush recruitment of several American scientists to research the find. The creature thaws and escapes the block of ice. What is next is a series of events similar to the original film with crew members one by one being assimilated by the Thing, leading up to a climatic showdown at the buried alien spacecraft that crash landed in the ice several thousands of years earlier. The end of the film is excellent as it blends in PERFECTLY with the opening of the 1982 film, essentially allowing you to watch both films back to back almost seamlessly.  All pleasantries aside however, the story is not incredible, and the CGI effects are ghastly to put it mildly (it makes you TRULY appreciate the work that Rob Bottin, and Stan Winston to a much lesser extent, did in 1981-1982). What the movie DOES do, however, is explain some of the mysteries seen at the smoldering remnants of the Norwegian camp as found in Carpenters film (the fire axe in the door, the hole in the wall, the straight razor guy, the burned up two-faced Thing, just to name a few), and although this film is not a tenth the film &#34;The Thing&#34; (1982) is, it is a worthwhile watch for fans, if only to help fill in the gaps.  (UPDATE) - After having seen the prequel several times now, I have a couple major gripes to add. First, why is there no mention of the Thing tearing through the persons clothes when they are assimilated as in the first film? They let this major part of the original films plot go by the wayside. Also, why is the Thing so eager to expose itself in this film when in the original film, it wanted to stay hidden, only revealing itself at the last possible moment? The whole sequence on the helicopter didnt make a lick of sense. The Thing was getting what it wanted - it was being taken to civilazation and then for no apparent reason, reveals itself and causes the helicopter to crash? Why? It doesn't make any sense at all.   I appreciate the attempt that the writers and director made at trying to create a seamless transition from one film to the next, but I feel they could've done a much better job of it.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Funny,  witty,  touching.  This is a kids movie that has something for kids and adults.  A great blend of humor and story for all ages.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|What can I say?  It's Tom Clancy!  A lot different than &#34;Hunt For Red October&#34;, Still,  VERY, VERY, good.  And, filled, as usual, with action.
B001BR5NN0|4.0|A bit dated.  If you are over 40 and haven't seen it you will like it.  The under 40s have to realize this was a trend setter at the time with good writing and hot young actors.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Seems like an amusing time killer so far. The response time seems good on my kindle and the actions and graphics are smooth so far. Just think it's funny how all these games ask you to rate them right at the beginning; i guess to catch you before you get bored.
B007P3TMW2|3.0|Production is well done,  writing is good, acting very good.  Why only okay?  It's a bit of a downer is all.  Overall it is a well done movie but might make you more sad than happy when its all over.
B007GEMQ2I|5.0|This is my 5th modular set and I keep coming back for more.  Haven't put this together yet but am looking forward to it as a winter project.
B0088TG252|4.0|If you are a Denzel Washington fan he won't let you down.  I thought it was well done  even though somewhat of a typical story/plot.  Looking for some good production and action?  Then watch this.
B000I5SY5U|5.0|This is really a classic, one of those foundation movies that you've seen and heard references from for years without even realizing where they were all stemming from.<br /><br />I think this is one of those movies that is important to see because it's part of the Zeitgeist of our generation.<br /><br />It's also light but very entertaining.
B0088RQ4X4|1.0|Lacking in every respect of movie making.  Should have been made into a Saturday morning cartoon it would have fit in well in that genre.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love your games I just wanted to see if you want to make more<br />games I now more mods that you didn't make your the best game<br />maker's ever.I mean that so that's all
B00AMBH70S|4.0|Good action and production and entertaining for this genre.  The ending is a little weak but leaves the requisite opening for yet another sequel.
B00AF46Q5Y|5.0|Part two of the trilogy - a must .  Jeffrey Archer did it again.<br />After reading out of sequence - this was even better than the last of the trilogy
B00821OX98|3.0|A bit sappy,  the family angle is good but way over done.  But a better than average series if you like sci fi.
B002KQ6BT6|4.0|this is the first time reading I enjoyed the excitement of Langdon adventures keeps you in suspence to the end
B00DC7N9NS|1.0|Maybe I got sucked in to thinking this would be cool.  I guess if I were still 6 or 7 and it was a cartoon then I may have enjoyed it.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|I  love Demille books the excitement the suspence of his books and John Corey adventures keeps you reading to the end
B00A6PD9I4|3.0|As always the computer animation is excellent.  Not one of Pixar/Disney's best but still fun and if you aren't expecting too much you will probably enjoy it.
B008IJTFYW|4.0|I like all the sounds of nature and relaxing flute.  It helps me to settle down before going to sleep.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|Its a typical outsider finds her niche movie but even with the stereotypes and predictable plot moves there is some humor and nice chemistry and the music is fun as well.
B004ZNACA6|5.0|All the music I can ask for and more! Wouldn't ask for anything else! If someone is looking for great music look no further!
B002MGGM9I|3.0|Production is a bit low end and some of the performances a bit flat but it is a little bit of a mind bender for those who enjoy time travel or the thought of parallel universes.
B0060ANOXY|5.0|All the music I can ask for and more! Wouldn't ask for anything else! If someone is looking for great music look no further!
B00D6BQPMM|2.0|Written for the teen crowd.  Not much intelligent thought put in this one.  A cookie cutter plot in the midst of a zombie apocalypse.
B0012IWHUU|5.0|All the music I can ask for and more! Wouldn't ask for anything else! If someone is looking for great music look no further!
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|Like so many Tom Cruz films now it just doesn't quite hit the mark.  Not bad but lacks the emotional pull to really bring you in.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This game is awesome! I have lots of dragons, four obsidian dragons, 3 earth ones, 2 lighting, and more! I love this game. 3 of my obsidian are level 10 babies! I LOVE THAT THEY HAVE THE FOUNTAIN OF YOUTH! Great game, I highly recommend it.
B00APUQRPC|3.0|A nice movie with a nice message but not the provocative Eastwood we have enjoyed lately.  Usual father / daughter reconciliation plot.
B00BVYNSLC|5.0|So underrated. Check it out. The last three episodes are insane. I've seen a lot of TV and am not usually into sci-fi, but this is legitimately a great show. Also, probably the best acting performance I've seen in a LONG time.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|Best sci fi movie since alien.  Well produced, written and acted and has all the elements of a great sci fi flick.  If you like sci fi you'll like it.  If you are remotely interested in this you will like it as well.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is good to pass time and I also love how u go to different places on the tour.
B0085KGGHI|3.0|If you are a die hard Stones or Waters fan you will really enjoy it.  If not then you might get a little bored.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Not your usual happy ending. The series was a great read and well worth the time it took. The conclusion isn't as happy as one might hope but everything is very well wrapped up. I recommend this series.
B00BESM14U|3.0|Well done with good acting.  Typical coming of age with all the politically correct themes employed that our modern culture adores.
B002DJSBMA|5.0|Excellent writing, a superb cast, and stellar score.  Actually improves on the original.<br />Anthony Hopkins is a marvel.  Acting at its best.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I love watching this series it is soo odd but it is like a train wreck you just cant stop watching it.  I really like how they kept the same actors/actresses and just switched up the roles.  Two thumbs up the the demented writers and the amazing producers for  coming up with this hit show!
B000W9399S|3.0|I haven't read a fantasy title in decades (the last one I'd classify that way is &#34;Hitchhiker's Guide&#34;.)  I saw good reviews for the Discworld series, and thought it would be a good re-entrance (my favorite series was Fritz Leiber's Fafhrd & the Grey Mouser books.<br /><br />Imagine my surprise to meet &#34;Hrun&#34; and &#34;the Weasel&#34;!  The first thing I thought when I came across them (very early in the book) was, &#34;Is he satirizing Leiber (who was pretty satirical himself)?&#34;  It sort of colored my take on the whole book.  Even though the Weasel disappeared and only Hrun appeared later.<br /><br />The story was sort of fun, but I wasn't moved enough by it to continue the (is it 23 book?) series.
B003E8P9G0|4.0|I really like the way Rick Riordan puts the story together. It's an amazing read! The entire concept kept me reading for hours.
B0096PAA6E|4.0|Gar Clark Jr. is a prodigious talent whose skills are showcased extremely well in this very diverse offering...this music is best when Clark allows the speakers to bleed and his guitar to scream.Highly recommended!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|One of the best shows on tv. All these reality shows suck; good writing, casting, location, etc etc etc etc
B008BZIUHG|5.0|I was looking for something 70s retro with big,bold riffs delivered with style,stomp and swagger....this is it!Truly music in the finest Zeppelin tradition and in my book that is always a winner.
B00D014E4Y|3.0|My boys (4 and 2) love this movie and love Legos.  I was going to purchase this movie at FYE, but it was cheaper on Amazon so I purchased it through Amazon.  I wish I would have purchased the one at FYE because it came with the minifigure of Clark Kent.  In the Amazon product description it says it comes with one, but it doesn't.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This was a pleasantly surprising good read. Interesting characters, whose lives are brilliantly woven together; it surprises just when you think it is becoming predictable. I would highly recommend.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Story grabbed me, loved the history and character development. I wanted it to continue past the ending. I'd love to see it made into a movie.
B009AY04A8|5.0|I love the game it is a good way to spend my free time, it is easy to play it is a good game to play before going to bed
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Seriously on the edge of my seat the entire time! I really can't wait to read the next few books of the series.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|I know some people have commented on the violence, rape, incest & morbidity throughout this series, but I believe this is, a would be, accurate account of the times under the circumstances. Mr. Martin has gone above & beyond to engage all the senses, sight, smell, sounds, touch/texture & taste of any given scenario. I am THE LAST person to be a fan of violent television, movies, books, etc, but I am thoroughly enveloped in the design of this historical fiction. This series is so very well written! Kudos Mr. Martin!
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Too  many sexual parts but all in all a good read. Can't wait to read the last book. Let's see where we go from here.
0425266060|5.0|I haven't read books as enticing as these were in a very long time.. I could not put them down! I love the characters and how good Day is at telling their stories..with the perfect amount of detail. I can't wait for the rest of the series!!!
B001XVD21Y|5.0|A must see if you love film.  The acting is amazing. Scorcesse finest work ever.  Dicaprio and Damon are wonderful.
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|Love some of the songs, some are a little too contemporary (POP) for me, but that's just my choice. Phillip Phillips is amazing.
B000FC0SIM|5.0|I enjoyed this book for many different reasons.  The life events that shaped the author were fascinating. A highly recommended read.
B0000696I0|5.0|Just as good as when I was a kid! It's still got it! Awesome movie for any teenage mutant ninja turtles fan!
B00499NHLC|5.0|&#34;Sherlock&#34; provides a way to re-visit and re-enjoy the Sherlock Holmes stories.  Somehow those involved in making the show have moved the fictional detective forward in time, from print to video, while keeping the feel of the original characters.  Although using a computer and modern lab to gather data, this Holmes still depends most on his own powers of observation and reasoning.  It's still fun to see how the mysteries are solved!
B00DLKXF3A|5.0|This CD is awesome from start to finish, I love the classic metal feel to it, it's definitely my favorite metal album in recent years. Also, I had no idea that the deluxe cd came with some A7X coasters, it was a pleasant surprise.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|So far it had worked very well, has everything i need in an alarm clock. definitely recommended, and it is free
B001OGTQMM|5.0|Brought back memories of my military days overseas... when this album can out.  Me and my buddies were Rocking with this Album at full volume allowable in a Barracks environment.  Been looking for this for quite awhile I'm glad I found it here.
B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|If you read the first and second in the Jack Reacher series, don't stop.  I assure you they keep getting better and better.  I almost quit after the first two but refused to give in.  I am now on number 12 and I am glad I did not quit.  Jack Reacher and his team are fantastic. I could not picture Tom Cruise portraying this character on the big screen but he did a pretty good job.  Hugh Jackman might be able to pull if off even better.
B00ECU2RGY|3.0|Temporal dislocations and historical misrepresentations combine with overly subtle cloning themes to make a simple tale barely discernible within the awkwardly assembled footage. Good effects. Nice locations.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I'm not much of a game person, but this colorful game caught my eye long enough go get me hooked on its great little challenges!
0821210920|5.0|This book (part of a three part series) is the definitive work on photography. While Ansel Adams discusses prints, the application for digital is the same. This is required reading for anyone serious about photography and the process!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Pretty fun to play and some of the things you have to do are easy and some are harder.  I have played similar games and this one is good.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|I know they are getting older, but older isn't always bad.  These guys are great in this movie and can't wait to see Red2.
B009XIXVU6|2.0|The other two Hosseini wrote were much better. I struggled to get through this one several times but it depicts the tough life th Afghan had and still do.
B001VIMCW4|5.0|I think this series can live on into eternity.  I have had preferences to different bonds, but the movies are always entertaining!
B00CH26TL8|1.0|This was not worth using up my battery to play. Free but then it costs to make the upgrades. Going to delete it off my Kindle.
B000MV8XPG|3.0|My son LOVES construction equipment, so we got him this for his 3d birthday this past July and he loves it... once I made a few adjustments to it. My 2 complaints are #1, the latch for the arm, it always kept engaging while he was playing and it became frustrating to the point i removed it and #2, the weak plastic support bar that actuates the digging bucket. It bends at even the slightest load, so we had to work on teaching my son to pick up very light loads. We plan on replacing the arm with one milled out of aluminum, as that should address the issue. Overall, he likes it a lot, it just missed the mark of being a solid sandbox toy like his Tonka trucks from the 70's and 80's
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This was challenging and fun!  I enjoyed more than 100 levels as it was more logical.  Wish there were more levels and look forward to new ones!
B00AYB1RGG|2.0|It had some good action, gore - but the whole premise and the acting...wow it's been a long time since I've seen a movie this bad!
B00AA7V2Z0|4.0|Scary yet not so much that you'll spend the entirety with your eyes covered or your ears plugged.. Amazing premise. Way better than the 2nd season.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|Very well done. Setting is incredible. Heard next season will be the last, it will be missed. Masterpiece Theatre has come up with a masterpiece.
B00DQVST76|5.0|Everyone should watch this at least once, regardless if you are a Madonna fan or not. It's just completely breathtaking and inspiring. Nothing lifted my spirit quite like this tour!
B00DBSZEH2|1.0|Didn't get to watch. Amazon cut me off before I got to it.  Ever wonder how many non watched movies they collect for.  I was mostly my fault, but Amazon could give their Kindle and Fire customers some kind of break when this happens.
B001AJ09JW|5.0|Loved it. I would definitely watch it again. I would recommend watching it if you like spooky movies. Very good
B004MC8CA2|5.0|when I am in church this is a very easy bible to use. easy to follow message and make notes back
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Sounds are tremendous. You can put several sounds together if you so choose and they are wonderful. So many varied soothing sounds that you can listen to in accordance with your mood. It is certainly worth having.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Good actors, great plots, timing is perfect. It is a great teaser leaving you always wondering if Alicia Florick will leave her husband and marry Will Garner. The story  shows the warmth of family life and the sneaky ways of politics.
0691126887|4.0|This book is a perfect combination of completeness and beatiful art work. The plates are great, accurate and useful in field, Its a good idea put some hummingbirds in flight because the mayority of cases it is the way that we see in field, so you learn to identified this complex family in this postures. The introductory chapters  say the essentials and the review of birds families its a good point to start. Maybe I would have liked that the book had a more recent taxonomic treatments  for the families, but this is a minor problem if you are familiarized with the systematics of south-american birds ( for more details  or doubts simply look the american ornithologist union south american cheklist SACC). Additionaly  the maps of geographical ranges are small but if you know the fundamentals of the continent topography  you dont have problems. In sinthesis its a great book and very portable in field if you considerer your size...
B00355L2TU|5.0|Great workout!  Just started using it. Easy to follow for all ages.  Work at your own pace.  You start to feel energized
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|Great game to play if your bored, but after awhile is costs money  so you can only play so many times per day, and the pop up ads sucks.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|I purchased the first Three of GRR Martin's series of Novels in the Song of Fire and Ice books.  I really really Like them. But I won't say love, that's too sissy for someone reading this hardcore old worldly subject matter.  They are good reading!
B004HXIZVC|4.0|I love it but i cant find a way to make crisp recordings and thats a problem im working hard on my music and this isnt showing it.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I purchased the first three of these books for my Kindle Reader.  Yes I am also watching the HBO ongoing Martin series of Mini Movies.  Good reads.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I became hooked when I was playing for my wife.  It is good honest fun for the whole family.  Definitely challenging at times.
B009WUAK2M|5.0|really 2? all i got was the first one?!?!? thats horse crap its says 2 but shows #1. So apparently I need at least 20 words? huh thats odd I really wish it was the second show...i paid for prime but i guess im not geting it
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I am in the middle of watching season 2 and feel a real connection to the characters. This series is well written and acted. It keeps me engaged and thinking about the many relationships.
B000SEFCD8|5.0|Great advice learned some great tips interesting reading I will recommend this book to friends and anyone purchasing a new puppy
B0026P3G12|5.0|I bought this CD because of Susan Boyle's eye opening bravura performance of \\"I Dreamed a Dream' on 'Britain's Got Talent.' I was, like most of the world, simply stunned by that amazing voice.  After hearing the CD though, I have to say, I was just a bit disappointed.  Yes disappointed.  The song, on this CD does not sound nearly so grand or rich as it did when she performed it live.  It's still good, mind you, just not quite as good. Guess what though, it doesn't matter.  Not a bit.  Ms. Boyle totally 'redeems' herself, (if you are of the mind that redemption is needed) with \\"You'll See.'  I'm told that this is an old Madonna song <shudder> but after hearing it, it now totally and completely belongs to Susan Boyle.  This is the song for every child who grew up without love, for every young person bullied in school, and for everyone who has ever 'loved and lost' a person totally unworthy of that love. Hearing this song, thinking and remembering, I found my eyes watering. This is a powerful, powerful song of self worth.  And Susan Boyle announces beautifully that we are all worthy of self esteem and love.<br /><br />And there is what should be Susan's Boyle personal anthem, \\"Who I was Born to Be\\" For now, there can be no doubt, that Susan Boyle was born to sing, to share that gift with us all and to make each and everyone of us glad we are here to hear it.
B005WYFLNU|5.0|Melissa & Doug, as usual, always have cute, creative activities for kids.  I like that these came with multiple outfits for each set of dolls and I also liked that the dolls were from a variety of ethnicities.
B00A0B0KFY|5.0|Love how the author ties his biblical knowledge with the power of the subconscious mind to teach us how to keep a positive thinking to fulfill our heart desires
0307887448|5.0|for any nerd, gamer, or geek, this book is a must. i'm happy to say also that after some brief online research, this is going to be put into movie form sometime in the near to distant future. if you play competitive online sports (LoL, WoW, D3) then this book is the turn pager thats worth putting the mouse down for.
B00E5Q1HJS|5.0|So far JJ Abrams has done a fabulous job with the franchise.  It's fresh and new not recycled plots.  I look forward to more!
1455523550|5.0|I actually read the book before the movie and loved the book.  Some parts are rather graphic which I could've done without, but overall the book was great and had some surprises that caught me off guard.
B001QD5OSS|4.0|Very good movie.  Ms. Cruz did a fantastic job, I absolutely hated her character in this movie.  A Wonderful drama.
0446547646|4.0|I liked the story.  It had a few surprises in it and it also foreshadowed how it would end, but all in all it was a good book.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I just like the new/different features and how the turning mechanics work. I also like the funny comments and pictures you get after you die. Just seems more fun to me than #1!
1938469003|5.0|For anyone that brews professionally or at home, even for those who just love an IPA, this book has everything. History, facts, data, recipes, techniques.<br />Seriously, just stop reading reviews and buy this book now.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Love this game. So much fun. All the competition just get better and better. So happy that I decided to get this game.
B009AY04A8|3.0|have to keep tapping the screen to get by the dialog. in one place I had to tap over 70 times
B006PAZMMK|5.0|standard skrillex. all good songs for the gym. there is not much to say about it. if you like some hard electronic banging music this is a must have
B000JMKQX0|4.0|World War Z is not so much a book about zombies.  It's actually a book about threats that we here about on the news on a daily basis.  Only this time the problems are realized, requiring the world to respond.  The various perspectives of the book are refreshing.  No one story goes on too long.  The overal picture of what happened as well as what we needed to do to survive slowly comes into focus.  The focus itself is done brillantly without the author beating the reader over the head with the theme of zombies.
B004GGM444|5.0|standard skrillex. all good songs for the gym. there is not much to say about it. if you like some hard electronic banging music this is a must have.
B000LC51TM|5.0|If you aren't a fan of Rammstein or only remember Du Hust from back in the day this package will blow your mind.  There is one full concert on DVD and excerpts from two others as well as a cd of the full concert to listen to in the car.  Rammstein has an amazing live presence.  The concert is all the explanation one needs to then go and buy all of the other CDs that Rammstein has put out.
B0070UFMOW|3.0|Overall for my use, The fiio E17 just felt like a volume booster. The treble and bass boost was noticeable, but overpowering at times for my use. The quality is very sturdy and it comes with the small screen protector.<br /><br />The battery is what I dislike about this DAC though. I'm not sure if it is my battery's problem or not, but it could not hold a charge for long. If I have it at 100% charged and then leave it off for maybe 1-2 weeks, it will completely discharge. At one point, I left it off for about 2-3 months. When I had tried to charge it again, instead of the solid red light from the button, it would be a blinking/flashing red. With this state, it did not charge at all. Once I unplug it, it dies.<br /><br />I think the idea is to allow some charge in the Fiio E17 at all times or the battery will become a dud. I'm not a fan of this though
B00006AW2S|1.0|I bought this as a CD, with the AutoRip. The Autorip didn't include two tracks.<br /><br />I bought the digital MP3 version. Despite the fact it says it consists of 12 tracks, the MP3 version did not include the same two tracks.<br /><br />Either way one must buy the missing tracks separately.<br /><br />So anyone who bought this should check to see if they got the whole album.<br /><br />Should also check their \\"December's Children,\\" which omits one track.
B00BIVN82M|5.0|they both love it keeping it cool buble style the real deal sets the tone/mood --to be loved for sure
B00AQMSJI2|4.0|This game is fun and addicting. I recommend it for all the pirate lovers out there. Good for all ages.
B00DY951RQ|5.0|really enjoying this set. i think the highlight is the isle of wight cd, very good quality sound for a live performance 40+ years ago. its a keeper tho i think the tell tale signs is the best of the bootleg series. the remaster of SP is also excellent, definitely sounds tighter than the origina. stand out songs: days of 49; when i paint my masterpiece; pretty saro; wigwam; went to see the gypsy; all the tired horses; working on a guru; little sadie.<br /><br />its nice to come back to this album after not listening to it for many years. much of it is very good tho under appreciated.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This is so addicting. I really Love it! I recommend this for old and young alike. It entertains for hours on end.
158270208X|5.0|Given the powerful message of gratitude in The Secret, this very inspirational book gives you a beautiful way to record your blessings and intentions every day!<br /><br />As an author, I love how this journal looks and feels- just like leather, with a red ribbon page holder. The quotes will remind you of the bliss your life becomes as you continue your daily gratitude practices.<br /><br />Thank you, thank you, thank you Rhonda for creating this exquisite book. As I use this book, my gratitude practice has certainly had a remarkably positive effect on my life.
B006LXQID8|5.0|A funny, witty, heartwarming story of Amelie. The narration is clever and friendly. The acting wonderful. This is a feel good movie and not your average romantic comedy.
B002PEP4U0|4.0|I read this because I had to because it was on my summer reading list and i thought that this book would be really boring but in the end i liked it. : )
B009KS4XRO|2.0|Game is fun, but very frustrating.  One number called and three bingos pop up.  Rigged games take the fun out of it.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Well constructed, developed, produced and acted. Even though the characters are &#34;types&#34; they are still sympathetic and believable enough to hold your interest, sympathy and empathy. I guess you have to expect characters to get killed off in a multi-year series but it is getting a bit much. Nevertheless for someone who couldn't really get into Upstairs, Downstairs, the Abbey has more than a few moments. I'm looking forward to the next season(s?)
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Easily addictive. I find my kids playing this game for hour upon hour. They love the tasks and being able to play with friends.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|I love this series, and was thrilled to get everything all together.  Peter Falk is so talented, and the guest stars really add to it.
B009AY04A8|3.0|Good graphics. Fun word search. However I cannot tolerate being penalized repeatedly for random taps when I am only trying to move the screen or zoom in and out. There is also an excessive amount of conversation for no apparent reason. I read fast so I can zip through this but it takes up time. Surprised I was not penalized for tapping to read through the dialogue. Overall fun game. Not sure I would pay more than .99 cents for it.
B00BQ1D7BQ|5.0|The Rides much anticipated Cd featuring 4 original songs and some great covers has finally arrived. Can't Get Enough features 10 tracks that are a blues rock collaboration that's come together as a success.<br />The tracks<br />1.Roadhouse<br />2.That's a Pretty.

Kenny Wayne Shepherd plays guitar. Electric Flags Barry Goldberg is the keyboardist.<br />The trio is also joined by Chris Layton on drums and Kevin McCormick on bass.<br /><br />Covers of Neil Young, Iggy and the Stooges are featured.<br />I really liked their version of Keep on Rockin' in the Free World. What a great song to cover as it is a favorite.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great Cd made by talented individuals that you can listen to for years to come. I highly recomend it for anyone who loves blues rock, and good music.
B003G8Y4QO|5.0|Great Series.  I have been a Dr Who fan for decades.<br />Season 5 was highly entertaining.<br />I hope this show is around for 20 more years at least<br />I think Mr. Moffat is a wonderful writer for this series and hope there will be more like<br />him when he decides to be a watcher and not a writer.  Wish I could think up some of<br />things he does.
B009AZZEU2|4.0|I'm really conflicted with this album. There are no stand out tracks. That being said most tracks are very good. Was this worth the wait? Absolutely not, but its still a good album. Their sound track single off Avengers Live To Rise  should have been included. Big mistake as that song is better then any song off this record. I can't blame Matt Cameron for going back to Pearl Jam. Wouldn't you?

B001BKVWYG|5.0|After seeing the documentary film &#34;Searching for Sugar Man&#34; I had to get both of Rodriguez's albums. They are quirky and production is not up to today's standards, but definitely worth having as part of your music collection.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Superb acting and lovely story line.  Well written and well executed.  It felt like 15 minutes if even that because I was so engrossed in the characters.

B002MQYOFW|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. I caught myself thinking about it and what the next pages would hold. Excitement and suspense!
B00DLKXF3A|3.0|After Nightmare ended on such a high-note, I was worried that the band had exhausted any creative talent that they had remaining after The Rev passed. When the \\"Hail to the King\\" single came out, my worries were escalated into the \\"danger zone.\\" I thought the single was awful (and still do) but luckily it is the weakest song on the album.<br /><br />The album opens with \\"Shepherd of Fire\\" which is an amazing song in it's own right but then we're completely shot down when it's followed up by the mediocre \\"Hail to the King\\" single which we've all heard before. After managing to pain through \\"Hail to the King\\" you're treated to another poorly written song in \\"Doing Time.\\" If you managed to make it through those songs then you're treated to \\"Sad but True\\", err no, sorry.. I meant \\"This Means War\\" and it's the third song mediocre song in a row.<br /><br />I won't lie after listening to those three songs, I was ready to slam this album but then \\"Requiem\\" came up to bring the album back to where it needed to be, it's an amazing track and it's followed by an amazing ballad in \\"Crimson Day.\\" \\"Heretic\\" is decent in it's own right and it's certainly better than most of the tracks on this album so far. \\"Coming Home\\" is another great track with a catchy chorus, killer guitar solo and it does a good job of showing what Arin is capable of.<br /><br />Follow that track up with \\"Planets\\" which is an amazing song musically, but it's completely and totally ruined by M. Shadow's vocals. The closing track is \\"Acid Rain\\" and it's a pseudo-ballad that (once again) is a great track that's completely and totally ruined by Matt's voice. Also, what's up with the hanging minute on the last track? Was that necessary?<br /><br />The mix of the album is fantastic. All of the tracks are booming with no unnecessary feedback in the songs and the producer (Mike Elizondo) should be commended for the mix he produced.<br /><br />The album has more bad than good unfortunately. The second half of the album could be killer if not for Matt's subpar performance. Some tracks are great but others are unoriginal and uninspiring. The band's performance is good for the most part; The guitars and bass are great. The drums are all right, but Matt sounds bored and at times completely bland. I'd gladly award this album four stars if it weren't for Matt's mediocre performance on this album.<br /><br />The Songs: 3/5<br />The Mix: 5/5<br />The Band's Performance: 2/5<br /><br />\\"Album of the Year?\\" Hardly. The new Queensryche album kills this, in my opinion. My suggestion is to not listen to any reviewer and just listen to the album for yourself.

B002G1YPH0|5.0|I was a little skeptical at first as to how much this thing could really cool a cpu for the price. Man am I glad I got it!<br /><br />First boot up with it on, my temperatures were 25°c+ cooler than with a stock one.<br /><br />This thing is quite big looking out of the box, barely fit into my micro atx case. It is advised that you measure just in case.<br /><br />Installation is somewhat tricky, and tedious if this is your first aftermarket cooler. I would suggest looking up a tutorial on google for first timers.<br /><br />Besides the fact, this is a great aftermarket cooler for the price! Highly recommended for anyone looking for a supplement to their stock cooler, even overclockers could make use of it.

B00EB85AP2|5.0|Despite being some of Rachmaninov's greatest works, there are few virtuoso recordings of The Bells and Symphonic Dances.  The Berlin Philharmonic has never had a principal conductor known for Rachmaninov and to my knowledge this is their first  recording of The Bells.  Rattle has barely touched Rachmaninov, so has he been able to acclimate to the Russian temperament?<br /><br />Rachmaninov considered The Bells his favorite composition, but it hasn't been recorded by today's leading Russian maestros, particularly Gergiev, Petrenko, and Jurowski.  On ICA Classics there is a memorable recording from Svetlanov and the BBC Symphony that is full of dark, Russian soul.  Jose Serebrier and Gianandrea Noseda have contributed readings that are likewise idiomatic and very Russian, though less intense.  Naturally, Rattle's account doesn't have the same flavor, given that he's a British conductor working with a German orchestra and choir.  Thankfully the soloists, Luba Orgonasova, Dimytro Popov, and Mikhail Petrenko are Russian and very fine.  From the opening bars of \\"The Silver Sleigh Bells\\", we enter a world that is more exuberant and carefree--there's no trace of darkness.  Critics may complain that Rattle isn't Russian enough, but as we progress, we find music-making that is full of orchestral playing better by far than anything else on disc, bringing out a new world of detail.  Surprisingly, Rattle ends up sounding more energetic than most of his rivals on disc.  His tempos lean on the fast side and he finds his success in reading into the score's modernity and wide range of color.  The alarm bells of the 3rd movement, for instance, build with startling vividness.  In my estimation, the Rundfunkchor Berlin makes up for not being Russian with its highly accomplished sound that transmits the music with detailed accuracy.  The only complaint listeners may have is that the account isn't Russian enough.  While it's true that this reading doesn't displace rival Russian readings, I think it fills a unique place.  It would be hard to deny the fervor emanated  from all involved, recorded from the same concerts as the Le Sacre released in April.<br /><br />There's not as great a shortage of readings of the Symphonic Dances, but few could truly be described as virtuosic.  Ashkenazy's reading with the Concertgebouw was jaunty and lighthearted without aiming for orchestral depth.  On the other hand, Gergiev's recent LSO Live recording was grave and serious, not one to highlight the solos or orchestration.  The up-and-coming Petrenko almost seemed our best option, with fiery conducting that was dramatic without being heavy-footed, but he didn't have a great orchestra in the Royal Liverpool Phil.  Rattle took advantage of his opportunity and we now have a new great reading that utilizes both the individuality and crushing impact of the Berliners.  But for all his highlighting of new details, Rattle doesn't come across as fussy, his afflicting flaw.  Anyone who finds deficits in Rattle's conducting has found flaws I'm incapable of hearing.  The sonority of the Berliners, voiced impeccably, is staggering in full cry, making the most of the dramatic potential.  Equally captivating, of course, are the many solos sprinkled throughout the work.  I can assure you they are on a level far above anything else on disc.<br /><br />Since he came to these works with little background in Rachmaninov, I feared Rattle might seem out of touch in these works.  But instead we have readings that can be compared with the best, with incomparable playing--bravo.I think it fills a unique place.

0767827902|5.0|Peter B. assembled the perfect cast to flesh out this story.  From the wonderful Ben Johnson as Sam Lyon to Cybil Shpard as the dream girl in this burned out little Texas town, it is perfect to the last detail.  I believe one of the finest pictures ever produced, directed, and acted.  Cloris Leachman was one example of the brillance of this movie for the ages.

B008FYZIVY|5.0|I only discovered Downton Abbey a year ago; and I just love it,  I watch the 3 seasons regularly on DVD.  The actors did a wonderful job in all of the three seasons.  Season 3 was a shocker, with Matthew's accident.  This is television, so I was hoping that perhaps he will just be injured like during the  War. I can dream can't I.  Waiting to find out what Edith will do; Anna and Bates, how they will llive. Daisy  is she going to the Farm?  O'Brien has got to go.  And Thomas I hated him so, but I feel sorry for him, and hope that he turns around for the better.  I am so looking forward to watching Season 4!
B005LAIH2C|4.0|My daughter and I needed a movie and this one was pretty good. I didn't think I would like it and it was actually a decent action type movie. I was pleasantly surprised.
B004XJRQUQ|3.0|I had a hard time rating this trilogy. The writing is very good. The story arc is epic in scope, with a large cast of characters, and enough plot elements to make a Chem major go crazy.<br /><br />So what I liked. Very descriptive without drowning your own imagination. Excellent pacing between action, drama, and long arc plot development. An in depth look at human nature and what becomes of a mind depending on its social environment. Ultimately this story explores human sociology and our own tendency to dominate one another, and when finally pushed to far over turn that dominance. Along the way we also see the ramifications of individual psychological impact of repeated traumatic life experiences and the results of human misery in the fractured mind of our protagonist. It's amazing, detailed, brave, honest, and hopeful.<br /><br />Alright then here's what I didn't like. It was horribly depressing. The main character starts out as an already emotionally walled off young teenager that had to grow up to fast. It's basically all downhill for her from there. Facing almost certain death to save a sister, being forced into fake relationships, having loved ones threatened with death, having them tortured, killed en mass, find a small spring of hope, and then right at the end, snuffing it all out. By the end I almost wanted to open up my own wrists. The author throws you a tiny bone in the closing pages. But let's be honest, it's kind of like saying &#34;so you’re a blind paraplegic, at least you have your health&#34;.<br /><br />I am a little surprised this is called young adult. The content is graphically violent, extremely advanced in its discovery of human misery, and not very subtitle in exploration of politics at most evil. That aside it is a very good story. I finally decided I would rate a 3 star. I did like it. However, it's hard enough to read that I don't think I will be reading it again.
B00E3UN44W|1.0|How are we supposed to \\"review\\" a Season 3 when it hasn't even been produced yet?  How can Amazon put a price on it before it's even out?  This is the most ridiculous scheme!!!  And needless!!!  We, Sherlockians, will buy any new seasons that are produced so there is no need for such deception.  Being a long-time customer of Amazon, and mostly a happy one, I'm sorely ashamed of them for this \\"offer\\" of a non-existent Season 3.

Yea, it was interesting to see him in his TV world but the real interesting story is him out in THE WORLD - that's where the movie ends.....????  WTF?

0739384198|4.0|There are books that engross the reader at such a level that to depart for the shortest of moments (for inconsequential things such as sleep, eating, etc.) is difficult.  When one finds such a read, there is clarity to the discipline of reading brought to mind - letters create words, words form sentences, sentences evolve into stories, stories come from experience, experience helps define who one \\"is.\\"  I was surprised to find such an experience while reading (albeit it was actually read to me) this finale of a grand, intriguing (and, alas, only) trilogy by the late Swedish author, Stieg Larsson.  Good writing often causes me to lose myself in the tale being told, this book created the feeling of being a part of the narrative.<br /> Lisbeth Salander - Goth, computer hacking genius, tough-as-nails survivor - arrives at a Copenhagen hospital with gunshot wounds (one in the head), dirt caked in her hair and a police escort.  (Those who have read the second installment of this trilogy know how she obtained such wounds, those who have not, will need to read that account SOON!)  Over the next 650 pages, every moment of what caused the \\"dragon tattoo\\" to be inked and why the girl wanted to \\"play with fire\\" is explained and brought to resolution.  To give more detail in such a short review would be to steal a moment of the thrill in undergoing the tension, pain, fear, joy, justice and fitting outcome for the story of Lisbeth.  Suffice it to say that every injury, blow, swindle, betrayal and many of the insults this anti-heroine suffered is accounted for, graphically, with adult language peppered throughout and in Spades, in the pages of this book.<br /> Upon reflecting as to why this book held me so closely, aside from it being excellently written, I arrived at the conclusion of just how important \\"justice served\\" is to me.  There is little mercy shown to anyone in this book, but justice is a major theme.  Justice without mercy can lead to tyranny; mercy without justice holds the potential for anarchy.  Mr. Larsson provides a culture in which the balance between Justice and tyranny has found a balance.  I am not sure how my realization \\"sits\\" with me, as I have always viewed myself as merciful, yet I root for \\"the bad guys\\" to get their comeuppance over being shown the Mercy I would desire.<br />The villains in this trilogy are clearly marked, are evil to their core and demand \\"what they want, when they want it and let others pay for it\\" and finding delight in seeing them \\"get what's coming to them is expected, but life is not so cleanly divided.  Often the justice I demand is the evil I denied.  Good fiction opens doors unexpected, in this one I am reminded of, and more deeply understand, what is required of me  \\"to do Justice, love Mercy and walk humbly with my God (Micah 6:8).\\"  Thanks for the parting gift, Mr. Larsson.ds the potential for anarchy.

B004SCI9BS|3.0|This review has two different components; one that deals with the emotional reaction to this album and the other with the album itself.  The three star review reflects the meeting place between them both.<br /><br />I truly love the Strokes, having been enamored with them from the start.  There was something echoingly beautiful about the mix of rich guitar riffs, the almost lazy vocals of JC and the playful but sobering lyrics.  In contrast to a lot of fans, First Impressions is actually my favorite album and Heart in Cage my favorite song.  When I first heart Angles, my heart plummeted in my chest.  Aside from 'darkness', a piece throwback to their earlier fans, this album moved in an entirely new and, for me, a depressingly unlikeable place.  I was raised by a drummer and electronic manipulation of music makes me shudder.  It was not a promising start.<br /><br />However, the album grew on me through repeated plays (and a strong desire to give anything The Strokes a chance).  It is a good album, with a good variety of catchy and interesting songs.  If it were another band then I would have given it a four but, after years of waiting and anticipating, it could only let me down.  Though there are several songs that I enjoy (I actually prefer Phrazes though, if I must have an electronic sounding JC), I recognize that this have not had the staying power of their first three albums (for me).  Those continue to get repeated play while Angles is typically thumbed through and forgotten.

B00EI6E0QM|4.0|Full disclosure, of late I have found Lady Gaga really irritating when it comes to her artifice and aesthetic. Primarily because none of it is original. I've had to literally just ignore the image and just listen to the music on it's own merits.However I will give credit where it is due and earned and Lady Gaga proves again in \\"Applause\\" that she is heads and shoulders the best pop musician and songwriter in comparison to her peers. Although \\"Applause\\" may sound simplistic to the casual listener,it is the quintessential catchy pop tune for this era (even those are not easy to write). The build up to the chorus is explosive and thrilling and I can see why 'little monsters' lose their minds. This is basically an effusive , ebullient , celebration of Lady Gaga by Lady Gaga and it's fun to listen to.I would be remiss not to mention the VMA's performance of \\"Applause\\".She really sold this pop nugget to the wider audience. She performed the song in a uniquely Lady Gaga aesthetic without 'homage-ing\\" someone else. I'm happy to see Gaga being Gaga again, aurally and visually.

B00B4FU6KE|4.0|Fowler is a solid writer.  Her approach to telling the story is unique.  She starts in the middle.  Wouldn't it be nice if we could all start in the middle?  it works here.  The story makes you laugh while pulling at your heart-strings.

B005VPRETE|5.0|My daughter loves these legos, she is 7. She was able to put it together all by herself although she has had some other sets to practice with. There are a lot of little pieces which are kind of a pain, but a lot of fun for the kids.
B0013TXA5Y|3.0|This was not my typical fare for book-reading, but it was okay.  Perhaps I can't properly evaluate because I really don't read this kind of book.  The movie is different, and okay, too
1452126577|5.0|Someone commented earlier that this was just a compilation of what was already all over the Internet, but that is not true.  I thought that's what it might be, and didn't care, but most of what was in the book were things I'd never seen before, and I thought I'd seen them all.  In fact, my first thought was that I was happy the owners decided to save some of the best Grumpys for the book.<br /><br />This book made me laugh out loud many times, so in Grumpy-speak, \\"It was AWFUL!\\"  So awful, in fact, I'm hoping they decide to write a series.  And thanks to the writers or publisher that decided to make it a hardcover.  As a bibliophile, I am always appreciative of a good hardcover book as opposed to soft cover or paperback varieties.  I am awfully happy to be adding this one to my collection.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This book will make you want to read more about Nazi Germany and the impact the Nazis had on everyday life during that horrible time in history.  The narrator of the story is Death, which is quite effective.

B000W8HC8I|3.0|I almost gave up on this book 2 to 3 times.  Redemption came in the last 1/4 of the book.  Should make a good movie, though

B00E882DQE|5.0|Although Poe is a dark writer he has a way of captivating you in the way he talks about death.
B00AKEMHCA|4.0|Best app ever! I found it and used my coins. Since the coins where promotional, the app was practically free for me, but it is worth the money anyway.<br /><br />P.S.<br /><br />you should add more towers and bloom types
B00AREIAI8|5.0|its awesome me and my uncle play it together everyday. I take care of my horse beauty and we have already raced tons of races!

B006XF5BTG|5.0|Very happy with my results from the book and absolutely thrilled with the fact that the author has answered questions I've had through email. The hard part is following the diet guidelines in the book which, admittedly, I'm not perfect on. Strength wise I have gained a tremendous amount already and managed to drop my body fat percentage significantly. Looking forward to finally cutting down to my goal and then following the \\"bulking\\" guidelines to put on some more muscle. Recommended highly.

B007PVHMCG|4.0|My 9 year old grandson enjoyed putting it together. He did not need any help. There were many extra pieces and one missing piece. Would be nice to have additional sets to go with it. Hefty price for such a small item.
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|Wouldn't recommend it and wouldn't watch it again a very bad story line kept waiting for more action, suspense and drama, wasn't sure of the story line at times a​nd kept waiting for something more, but it ended with no ending to the story
B00E5Q1HJS|5.0|Since my early childhood, I've enjoyed Star Trek and though I thought the next generation and follow-on series were good, what I knew was lacking was the original characters (Kirk, Spock, McCoy, Scotty, Chekov, Sulu, Ohura..., but especially Kirk and Spock).<br />The initial movie  was a wonderful way to give rebirth to their story and such a creative way to set forth new paths for them all, but especially Kirk and Spock - with their friendship being at the center of their journey.<br />This new movie was full of awesome surprises that I didn't see coming, even though I'd seen all the trailers over the past year before it came out.  The week it came out, my wife and I went into LA to the best IMAX theater we could find to see it (the studio had just used that theater the night before for the folks who worked on the film to see their new masterpiece).  The IMAX version was so amazing, enabling you to actually feel like you're in space with them whenever a 'space' scene came on screen (the IMAX footage).  The story, the banter between Kirk, Spock, Uhura, and McCoy was priceless and funny - setting a wonderful context for the more serious plot that was unfolding.  Of course, the weaving in of 'Dr' Carol Marcus was great as well (obviously fortelling a new retelling of another part of Kirk's destiny).  These new writers and JJ Abrams clearly have such a wonderful appreciation for what were such important parts of the original series and movies - especially Star Trek 2.  Often missed by fans was the fact that the movies Star Trek 2, 3 and 4 were a trilogy - and its heartening to see that the new team is quite respectful of that original storyline and can make use of its greatness in this new creation.<br />I wholeheartedly recommend that everyone see this movie.  I do recommend you see the first one before it, if you haven't, because it provides important context to this one.<br />For those who really get into this movie who haven't seen them, I recommend you watch StarTreks 2, 3 and 4, since those were both the best of the original Star Trek movies, but also their storyline is relevant to the one retold in a new way in this new fantastic movie!<br /><br />If you haven't seen this movie yet, just know there will be some great surprises!  Do not read too many reviews as some folks accidentally give them away and don't read the story synopses since they have started giving away some surprises.  Just sit back and enjoy the story unfold before your eyes!  Incredible special effects put you right into the story and the 'edge of your seat' action will not cease to amaze you and keep you guessing right to the end!  Enjoy this movie and have fun!
B003HARV3Y|1.0|I am not sure the film writer even read the book. The book was well written with a lot of humor, plot twists and surprises in it - all of which are missing from the movie. I am really not sure how anyone could mess up a good story as badly as has been done with this one. In short don't waste your time and money on this garbage movie.
B00DW5IM9Q|5.0|[NOTICE:  It has come to my attention there is an audible glitch on the 4th disk of the Deluxe version (which is the actual \\"Self Portrait\\" album remastered).  48 seconds into \\"Copper Kettle\\" (the best song on the original album, ironically enough) the track skips.  This glitch has been present on other releases as well, notably the 1980s reissues.  Apparently someone wrote in to Amazon to explain the glitch, and their answer was just mention it in their review so other people don't get stuck with the glitch! Mike London - 8-30-2013]<br /><br />\\"Self Portrait\\" has always been one of Dylan's most inscrutable albums, which is saying a lot, as Dylan is notoriouslu difficult to pin-down to any one pre-defined image that his rapid fans (of which I happily count myself as one of them) or his famously troubled relationship with the rock press.  Released in 1970, \\"Self Portrait\\" follows the very brief 1969 LP \\"Nashville Skyline\\", itself something of a head-scratcher for Dylan followers in the late 1960s. And make no mistake, the famed opening salvo of Greil Marcus's famous \\"Rolling Stone\\" review \\"What is this s--?\\" was by far the general consensus of \\"Self Portrait\\", with some going so far as to suggest that the breakup of The Beatles was the end of the 1960s, and Self Portrait was the end of Bob Dylan, effectively ending the two most potent musical forces in the 1960s counterculture.<br /><br />The release itself is in two forms: a two disk set with 35 tracks, and a four disk set with the complete Isle of Wight on a third disk and a remastered version of the original album on the fourth disk.  The four disk set is, like \\"The Bootleg Series Vol 8\\", cost prohibitive to own.  The record comprises of \\"Nashville Skyline\\" outtakes, \\"New Morning\\" Outtakes, the long known but uncirculating \\"Only a Hobo\\" from the \\"Greatest Hits Vol III\\" sessions, and obviously \\"Self Portrait\\", with the lion share's going to SP.  Despite its title, there is a Basement Tapes recording of \\"Minstrel Boy\\" from 1967 included, which from a recording sessions perspective is the single biggest revelation yet unveiled in \\"The Bootleg Series\\" - NO ONE knew that \\"Minstrel Boy\\" originated during the Basement Tapes era, let alone that a BT recording even existed!  One disappointing fact is that some of the Isle of Wight performances appear on both Disk 2 and Disk 3 (if you get the deluxe version of this set) which creates unnecessary duplication of material.<br /><br />Hyperbole aside, So what does \\"Another Self Portrait\\" tell us about the original \\"Self Portrait\\"?  Simple.  \\"Self Portrait\\" should have been far richer than its detractors will allow for, that it has a sever identity crisis, and that, of all Dylan's albums, it is a key to understanding and \\"unlocking\\" the \\"enigma\\" of who Dylan actually is (the answer - a musical chamaeleon, a cultural transmitter of pre-rock American musical forms who inputs little to none of his own identity in his work, only excepting his vast encyclopedic love of pre-rock traditions).<br /><br />So, what is that identity crisis?  Answer: \\"Self Portrait\\" falls somewhere in between a legitimate follow-up to \\"Nashville Skyline\\", a slight country album, and a wilfully perverse screw-you to his fans.  This tension between a legitimate artistic statement and a \\"Leave me alone attitude!\\" makes the original release so fascinating.  Listening to \\"Another Self Portrait\\" is revelatory - it's obvious that, listening to these outtakes, had the album been sequenced properly, we could have had a fantastic, cohesive Dylan album that, while radically from his 1960s' work, would have shown just how masterfully he was at interperting other people's work.  \\"Another Self Portrait\\" also shows that, at least originally, the project began as a serious album, and not a red herring to throw off his followers.<br /><br />As is typical with so much of Dylan's output, the outtakes say as much (and in the case of Self Portrait, MORE) about a particular album as the songs that actually make the final product.  There is simply no reasonable explanation as to why songs like \\"Thirsty Boots\\", the stunning \\"Pretty Saro\\", \\"Annie's Going to Sing Her Song\\", and \\"Railroad Bill\\" did not make the final cut.  Dylan's vocals are fantastic throughout; nuanced, compelling, hard-hitting.<br /><br />Compare these tracks to what DID make the album: two versions of \\"Alberta\\" (itself a good song, but the takes aren't really that different to merit the inclusion of both), two different versions of \\"In Search of Little Sadie\\" (though with quite different arrangements), a double tracked version of Dylan dueting with himself on Paul Simon's \\"The Boxer\\", which is so bad it almost sounds like Dylan's doing a sendup of Simon, and four badly mixed, badly sounding Isle of Wight performances.  Indeed, the live rendition of \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\" sounds like a parady of the masterful original, a gross reminder of just how far removed Dylan wanted to be from his adoring fan base.  Songs like \\"Copper Kettle\\" and \\"Days of `49\\" show encouraging signs of what Dylan was up too.<br /><br />\\"Another Self Portrait\\" also reveals that \\"Nashville Skyline\\", \\"Self Portrait\\", and \\"New Morning\\" (released a mere FOUR months after \\"Self Portrait\\") is much more homogenous artistically than the critics would lead you to believe.  The commonly accepted narrative in rock criticism is that Dylan quickly recorded \\"New Morning\\" after the disastrous reception to \\"Self Portrait\\".  \\"Another Self Portrait\\" reveals a different narrative however; there is little to differentiate the \\"New Morning\\" sessions from the \\"Self Portrait\\" sessions in either style or content, with the only main difference being Dylan began writing more original material during the latter sessions (much like he did with \\"The Basement Tapes\\").  However, it's notable that seven of the nine covers from the 1973 \\"Dylan\\" album (which Dylan has disowned, and was released without his input as revenge by Columbia when he leftfor David Geffen's newly formed Asylum Records) hail from the \\"New Morning\\" sessions, proving Dylan was just as interested as interpreting and playing other people's music as he was performing his own.<br /><br />So what makes \\"Self Portrait\\" so inscurtable?  Well, first off, it's discerning Dylan's intent.  What was he trying to do, or accomplish, with this double LP?<br /><br />If you read Dylan's various statements throughout the years, you will get conflicting reports.  The most commonly accepted explanation (and one advocated by Greil Marcus in the liner notes) is Dylan was trying to \\"shed\\" his audience.  Dylan himself said as much in a Rolling Stone interview from 1984.<br /><br />\\" I wish these people would just forget about me. I wanna do something they can't possibly like, they can't relate to. They'll see it, and they'll listen, and they'll say, 'Well, let's get on to the next person. He ain't sayin' it no more. He ain't given' us what we want,' you know? They'll go on to somebody else. But the whole idea backfired. Because the album went out there, and the people said, 'This ain't what we want,' and they got more resentful. And then I did this portrait for the cover. I mean, there was no title for that album. I knew somebody who had some paints and a square canvas, and I did the cover up in about five minutes. And I said, 'Well, I'm gonna call this album Self Portrait.'\\"<br /><br />While it is impossible to speak to another person's motivations fully and with equal authority to that person himself, I personally believe that this explanation is reducing the truth about \\"Self Portrait\\" to a much more limited capacity than it really was, at least in 1970.  Looking back throughout the years, Dylan may have analyzed himself more and more and come up with the explanation he was trying to deal with his frustrations with his vampire fanbase (who he described in the same interview as \\"sucking the blood\\" from him), and that may very well be part of his motivationfor recording of \\"Self Portrait\\".<br /><br />However, there was always some evidence (on both the album itself and contemporary interviews circa 1970) against that being the only reason why Dylan put out \\"Self Portrait\\", and with \\"The Bootleg Series 10: Another Self Portrait\\", that evidence has only grown exponentially.  Despite what Dylan would later say, interviews given around 1970 carries far more weight, as Dylan himself was closer to the actual event.  Like everyone else, as the years go back memories fade and we often forget what we were really thinking, or come up with alternate explanations.  In a 1971 interview with notorious A. J. Weberman, who knew more about Dylan's (literal) trash than Dylan' probably did, Dylan defended the album, angrily blasting Greil Marcus.  Robert Shelton asked Dylan in 1986 about Self Portrait, and, notably, he differed from his official reason of audience shedding: he said that songs like \\"Blue Moon\\" were an expression, and had someone like Elvis Presley or the Isley Brothers had released that album, then the response would have been much different.<br /><br />Allen Ginsberg, who had known Dylan since the early 1960s, went on tour with him in 1975.  A relevant quote from Bill Morgan's biography of Ginsberg is one of the keys to unlocking the mystery of \\"Self Portrait\\".  \\"The more Allen thought about Dylan, the more he realised that he didn't really know him at all, and he commented that he thought it was possible there was no \\"him\\" to know.  He was beginning to think Dylan didn't have a \\"self\\" at all\\".<br /><br />This concept of Dylan not having a \\"self\\", albeit rather abstract and perhaps hard to define in a practical sense, to me brings intense illumination on not only this era of Dylan's recording career (1969-1971), but to the entirety of his career in general.  If you accept Ginsberg's assertation that Dylan has no self, the title of \\"Self Portrait\\", a double album of then contemporary covers and reimaginings of old folk songs, no longer has the smug ironical tone that some reviewers have mistakenly assigned to the project, but rather a deep truth about Dylan himself that has only been born out in subsequent years.  And what is that truth?<br /><br />Ginsberg was famous for recording his life in great detail, and reading through his works you get a real sense of his life, his personality, and who he was as a person and what he stood for and was concerned with.  In contrast, Ezra Pound's first major book of poetry was entitled \\"Personae\\", where you never hear Pound's own true voice, but rather a kaleidoscope of different voices and different masks.  Even in \\"The Cantos\\", other than Pound's economic theories, you will learn far more about Pound's sense of history than about his character and soul.<br /><br />Likewise, Dylan has always been more a conglomeration of differing traditions than an original force, unique unto himself.  The title \\"Self Portrait\\" was not meant to be ironic; Dylan finds his identity through his own synthesis of traditional, Americana music.  While that may be a very broad claim to make, I am able to provide a good deal of evidence for such an assertation.  While not one solitary piece of evidence can conclusively prove one way or the other that Dylan's identity is not his own, the growing amount of evidence can be used in conjunction with each other that, quite convincingly, Dylan's real identity is traditional music, and, with one notable exception, we have never been very close to who Dylan \\"really is\\", because he really isn't anyone.<br /><br />Now, any hypothesis worth its salt should be able to accurately account for various, otherwise inscrutable facts and phenomena.  The idea that Dylan doesn't have a \\"self\\", or, at least, use his music to express himself (far removed from \\"confessional\\" poets like Sylvia Plath, Robert Lowell, and Anne Sexton, and much more in tune with Pound and T. S. Eliot's historical mode of thought) is quite a suitable framework toexplain several otherwise odd facets of Dylan.  It also explains his disdain for politics; Dylan was never political, despite what his followers wanted.<br /><br />Before we examine the evidence, let's first examine the one sore spot in the theory, and the closest Dylan has ever came to his own personal life: \\"Blood on the Tracks\\", his 1975 album.  Triggered by the disolution of his marriage to Sara Lowndes, the record is a heart-breaking divorce album.  Yet even here, Dylan throws some curve balls.  \\"Tangled Up In Blue\\" is far from a straight cry of pain, and is a jarring narrative that moves all over both time and space.  Secondly, \\"Lily, Rosemary, and the Jack of Hearts\\" is a complex, lyrically demanding story straight out of the American west.  However, excepting those two songs, the rest is an unusually straight reading of the pain that Dylan was going through.  Jakob Dylan has said that album documented the dissolution of his parent's divorce and failing marriage.  The album was wrought in pain, and when an interviewer once asked Dylan about the album's popularity, he said he did not understand why people enjoyed that much pain in their life.<br /><br />What is more revealing, however, is what happened AFTER \\"Blood on the Tracks\\".  He recorded \\"Desire\\", a deeply detached album emotionally (with the only exception being the last song, \\"Sara\\") that delves into strong, lyrical story telling, especially coming off the heels of such an emotionally naked album like \\"BOTT\\".  Equally interesting, after \\"BOTT\\", Dylan wrote several songs that were as emotionally intense as its predecessor but would not record them, electing instead to go with \\"Desire\\".  \\"BOTT\\" is far more an anomaly in Dylan's career than anything else he has put out, with the closest equivilant being \\"Time Out of Mind\\", another emotionally charged, deeply painful album.  (I always felt TOOM was BOTT aged twenty two years).<br /><br />First off is examining Dylan's career in its entirety.  The early 1960s has Dylan going through his troubadour, Woody Guthrie phase and political protesting; the mid 1960s' moving through surreal lyrical work which is heavily indebted to Beat literature and French symbolists; the late 1960s tapping into that \\"Old Weird America\\" as evidenced on \\"The Basement Tapes\\" (which, notably, the majority of which is still commercially unavailable), and then turning out a brief country album with the opening track being a rather off-kilter duet with Johnny Cash.  Even \\"John Wesley Harding\\" sounds much more an aural history of the United States post Civil-War, taping into the vast mythos of the American West, than ever revealing a single thing about who Dylan is as a person.<br /><br />Post \\"Self Portrait\\" (which for reasons of space I won't elaborate too greatly), we have the travelogue album of \\"Desire\\" and  the incredibly strange, wilfuly obtuse \\"Street-Legal\\".  In the 1980s, he went through a career crisis, with several listless albums, often blocking release of superior songs on these admittedly drab albums (with the most famous example being \\"Blind Willie McTell\\" from \\"Infidels\\", itself one of the stronger albums released during this period).  According to \\"Chronicles\\", in 1988, after a disastrous tour with the Grateful Dead, he realised he was not connecting with his music anymore, and had a personal revelation on how he needed to play and commenced with the Never Ending Tour, which proved to be a true turning point.<br /><br />In the 1990s, after two folk albums, he released \\"Time Out of Mind\\", which Dylan described as a deliberate attempt to make an old-time folky record, like the songs he would listen too back in the 1950s.  Every subsequent album (2001's \\"Love and Theft\\", 2006's \\"Modern Times\\", 2009's \\"Together Through Life\\", and 2012's \\"Tempest\\"), Dylan plays with pre-rock, old timey musical forms, each deeply rooted in the American musical body of work from the late 19th/early 20th century.  Listening to his work, never once do you feel like you're are truly getting to know Dylan intimately as a person (except fro TOOM, the emotional successor to BOTT); however, you do come away with a much deeper understanding of the cultural heritage of Americana music.<br /><br />We also have the Christian trilogy, which may very well be the closest we get to Dylan as an actual person; religious themes have always ran deeply through his work, far more deeply and important to him than being a mere superficial synthesis of his traditional interpretations of pre-rock music.<br /><br />In 1997, Dylan even said the following: \\"Here's the thing with me and the religious thing. This is the flat-out truth: I find the religiosity and philosophy in the music. I don't find it anywhere else. Songs like \\"Let Me Rest on a Peaceful Mountain\\" or \\"I Saw the Light\\"--that's my religion. I don't adhere to rabbis, preachers, evangelists, all of that. I've learned more from the songs than I've learned from any of this kind of entity. The songs are my lexicon. I believe the songs.\\"  In promotion for the 2009 \\"Christmas in the Heart\\" LP, he told interviewer Bill Flannagan he was a true believer when talking about \\"O Little Town of Bethlehem.\\"<br /><br />I think that, stepping out further from just religious concerns, this quote, in context with everything else, shows us just how important the music of \\"The Bootleg Series 10\\" truly is to Dylan.  In an outtake version of \\"Political World\\" from 1989's \\"Oh Mercy\\", Dylan sings the lines (deleted in the final released version) that there are woman, wine, and songs, but without the songs you won't get far in this world, which is one of the most revealing lines he ever wrote.  Likewise, the title of his panned movie \\"Masked and Anonymous\\", accurately describes Dylan himself, moving through life, inscurtable, unknowable.<br /><br />Marcus said \\"I once said I'd buy an album of Dylan breathing heavily. I still would. But not an album of Dylan breathing softly.  Ginsberg said in Scorcess's documentary \\"No Direction Home\\": \\"He had become at one with, or became identical with, his breath.  Dylan had become a column of air so to speak, where his total physical and mental focus was this single breath coming out of his body.  He had found a way in public to be almost like a shaman with all of his intelligence and consciousness focused on his breath.\\"  If anything, \\"Self Portrait\\" shows Dylan mastering the art of the Buddhist breath.<br /><br />I always thought, upon hearing Dylan was releasing a bootleg installment on \\"Self Portrait\\", that it was an incredibly strange choice, given how much everyone always hated the record (especiallt with the rumoured super-fan dream choice of a \\"Blonde on Blonde\\" installment).  Listening now, though, I understand.<br /><br />So, what does this all admittedly long discussion of Dylan's career and music (hard to succinctly compress for an Amazon review) mean for \\"Another Self Portrait\\"?  Simply this: \\"Another Self Portrait\\", appropriately enough, is probably the single most revealing release Dylan has issued, which is quite appropriate given its title.<br /><br />Decades ago, Dylan gave us the key to who he was as an artist, and we resented him.  Now, so many years later, we find Dylan was right after all - he is a mirror of Americana Music.  As a critic once said, Dylan has \\"vanished into a folk tradition by his own making\\".  Vanish, though, is not the right word.  The correct term would be \\"Homecoming\\".

B00E6Z0THE|3.0|The game had a lot of really good aspects such as fun mini puzzles and adventure. The only thing I really didn't care for was how the game ended once you solved everything. I was left feeling like I had invested all this time for nothing. Even though it lacked a climatic ending, I would still recommend the game.
006178480X|5.0|Another one of those books that I absolutely loved. James Rollins is definitely an author that grips my attention and his Sigma Force series has been absolutely wonderful. His books have that wonderful combination of high-tech gadgetry, science, and action/adventure all rolled into one that have had me captivated since I started reading his books. The character development is amazing throughout his books and I would recommend them to everybody I meet. My main advice to those who have never read his Sigma Force novels would be to start with the first ones so that way you can see how it all began.
B005I4JG80|5.0|Amazingly funny and insightful. I learned so much, I made my friends, family and husband read it! And then I re-read it. Be prepared to have your world rocked!
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I first purchased this case when I ordered my Kindle Fire. My husband later ordered his Kindle Fire while we were overseas and had to get a cover that he could find overseas. He always looked at my case and was jealous of it. Finally, we just broke-down and ordered this one again because it is just so wonderful. It is slim so that the Kindle is barely larger than it actually is. It is sturdy and exactly what we need. We are now proud owners of two Marware covers and we LOVE, LOVE them! Highly recommend.

B004J4WLB4|5.0|This is a novel that has been tagged a &#34;chick book&#34;.  That's too bad, because I am a man who worked construction and played every sport including football, and I loved the book.  It is so well written that you develop a strong bond to the central character from the very beginning of the book until the very end.  She is complex, bizarre at times, heart breaking, brutally honest, and extremely talented.  Ms. Diffenbaugh has captured the essence of all these qualities in the lines she has written throughout the book.

That is why I like it so much and recommend!

I like Waking the fallen, City of evil, and the self titled album, but nothing else has interested me-regarding an entire album anyways.<br /><br />I am happy this album seems a little heavier than the last one, but that's about the only improvement this one has, wasn't a fan of Nightmare either, except for a couple songs.  Well ok the first 4 or 5 songs and 1 or 2 others, whatever.<br /><br />What really caught my attention on my first listen is the blatent use of ideas from various influences of theirs.  Coming Home contains a blatent rip off of Iron Maiden't \\"Number of the beast\\".  The opening track reminds me a lot of Metallica's \\"Enter sandman\\".  Heretic has a 90's Megadeth feel to it, but at least it doesn't seem a rip off of any of their songs.  Doing time also reminds me of No.4/shangralawhatever, era STP.  With a title like \\"Hail to the king\\", this could be intentional, paying homage to their influential bands, without doing a covers album-Gamma ray did this a few years back, though I can't remember the album title.<br /><br />But the major problem I have is after 3 or 4 listens not much has grown on me.  Some songs are ok, but others just sound like filler.<br /><br />This album's main shining star, for me, is Planets.  I feel a little like there's a Dream Theater influence, but nothing blatent.<br /><br />Overall fanatics of the band will enjoy it because it's ASF regardless of if it's good or not.  People who don't know much by bands like Megadeth, Dream theater, STP Metallica and Iron maiden, will have a chance of liking this.  Definitely listen before you buy, I did and will only be buying a couple tracks.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I got this mouse roughly three weeks ago after building a gaming computer, and I love it. This is the first dedicated gaming mouse I have gotten, and all of its features are easy to use. I chose it for the price (and the good reviews here) and honestly think that I made the right choice.<br /><br />I'll start with the mouse itself: It's comfortable. It doesn't hurt my wrist to hold it for long hours of gaming. And, best of all, I don't find myself accidentally clicking the thumb buttons, even when I lift the mouse to re position (I tend to do this a lot, I can never keep my hand in one place for a long time. I shift the mouse a lot.) In fact, all of the buttons are hard to accidentally hit- you have to pretty deliberately press them. This is nice, as it makes holding it feel much more natural and you wont feel like you are fighting it to hold on/not hit stuff. The only problem with the design is that the pinky finger side has no sort of grip and is hard plastic; with my tendency to sweat, this can make my hand slide a bit. But this isn't much of a problem.<br /><br />The software is straightforward, too. I don't mind downloading the software (its only about 30 MB, hardly even worth a disk). The hardest part about programming macros is that you must do it within the software, not within a game. For me, that is a minor issue; you can load two profiles on the mouse at once (which can be switched with an easy to miss button on the bottom) and that is plenty for most gamers. You just have to remember to switch profiles out when you play other games. I keep one profile dedicated to a game I play all the time, and the other I switch.<br /><br />As far as programmable stuff: There's a lot. You actually have a button whose default setting is to switch the DPI sensitivity; you can change what the sensitivity is for each profile, as well. There are four initial settings: About 1000 DPI, about 2000 DPI, about 3000DPI and 8000 DPI, but you can change where these values actuallyfall for each profile and easily switch between them. You can change double click speeds. You can change basically everything.<br /><br />Colors: This mouse uses XML color coding, as far as I can tell, so there are thousands of options at your disposal. The Anker logo \\"breathes\\"- meaning that it fades in and out (you can set the speed for this, but there are only about 4 options), and there are four lights on the left side of the mouse indicating which DPI setting you are on.<br /><br />I keep all 8 weights in the mouse, and I kind of wish it was a little heavier, but that's ok. This is an excellent mouse and I highly recommend it to any gamer looking for a mouse.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|After replacing the last IPhone with a shattered face, this seems to be a less bulky lighter weight safe alternative.
1401216676|5.0|This is a 'Must Buy' for any fan of Batman (or the Joker, for that matter!). The ambiguous ending is nothing short of perfect. Alan Moore is a genius.
1400052173|5.0|Purchased this book for my son, as it was required reading for college.  We got it for less than half the cost of a new book!
B008602KQI|3.0|The movie was okay and I did not read any of the books. Named actors helped give the movie credibility and Jennifer Lawrence was a breath of fresh air. The plot I took from the movie is how society/government controls our everyday lives and I thought the author tried to bring this out in a fanciful tale.
1427214948|5.0|I read all the Cilfton Chronicles now II'm listening to them. Its a great series. I am a big fan of Harry Cilfton
0066620996|5.0|It looks like a text book but is really interesting.  I don't usually write in my books but this one has so many highlights and notes I certainly won't be loaning it out.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Well written book; explores a area our culture has difficulty dealng with. Very moving. I have recommended this book to many of my friends.
B006LSZECO|3.0|The book had some interesting plots but it ended really with nothing at all.  Ok reading.  Ending yuck. It left you with a feeling of what happened. Huh
1427229201|5.0|I have read all the Clifton Chronicles now I am listening to them and loving it. I am a big fan of the Clifton Chronicles and now am eagerly awaiting the next installment.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Used the weather channel for years. The only negative issue on Fire HD 8.9 is that the weather map in motion does not work with fire due to Adobe Flash not installed.
B007XIC1GI|3.0|Required reading.  Manson is a classic shock jock, but nothing surprises me anymore.  I wish he would just stick to music...oh wait cover songs...has he written anything good lately?
B00CAGCVZE|4.0|I like how small it is & that it can be clipped onto something. The sound is also good on it.<br />I'm disappointed that I cann't get the radio station I like to listen in on this device. I'm also having problems getting new music added to it.
B00E5Q1HJS|5.0|This was my first Amazon video purchase. The HD and quality and streaming performance were excellent. The fact that you can play on a lot of different devices is a plus over buying the Blue Ray.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Now that I'm officially addicted to this series, January can't come soon enough for the new season to start! It's gripping!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Why does a populist couple get enthralled with a soap opera about the English privileged class? I don't know, but it's entertaining. I like it. My wife likes it enough that when I say stuff like &#34;Those few people are living on the blood, sweat, and tears of good people marginalized by economic and social prejudice,&#34; she replies with &#34;Shut up, and let me enjoy the show.&#34;
0062086529|5.0|This book is adorable. Its perfect for bedtime and its quite imaginative. I like how Harold always comes up with a solution when he runs into a problem.
B009NG1Q96|4.0|I love reading and although this book doesn't jump any hoops I enjoyed it to the last page. It has interesting characters and a plot, while predictable, it is still entertaining. I plan to read the third book.
B005LAIIJY|4.0|I always enjoy tarantino films but this was not quite up to his best effort. violent sequences were good but storyline was unbelieveable.
B003NHRGSQ|3.0|This was recommended to me by my niece. Although it has a great story line, you just keep waiting for something happy to happen. Very depressing....
B005HJWWW8|5.0|Bought to use with Tork x-pro helmet speakers.<br />First tried with out Amplifer, medium to poor<br />Then turned amplifier on day and night.<br />Clean sound and lots of volume<br />Would rec this item
B005ZMUXDC|5.0|Adults will love it just as much as children. My 3-year-old granddaughter now wants to wear her hair like Rapunzel all the time.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I love this app! It's cool to mix different tones to create your own specialized sound track for meditation or bedtime.
B00BZW5W3W|5.0|Love Maysa, she still has the Incognito vibe. I always look forward to what she comes out with so I can add it to my other Maysa collections. She is truly one of a kind.
B001CEE1YE|5.0|if you don't know why you don't get it, just let your mind go and get in to it, and be free
B0067TGSOK|1.0|Devoid of actionable insight and meaning but buying this book is not nearly as bad an investment as actually reading it.
B0087GJ8KM|5.0|Being relatively new to sales I've been through a bit of training and read a lot of books the past few months this is by far the best and most useful. It's a thoughtful well researched text that is a huge cut above and beyond the rah rah old school sales book that would fit better in the motivational or even history section .
B00C9PQ7I8|5.0|I particularly love her last 3 CD's ... One True Vine, You're Not Alone and We'll Never Turn Back!  3 of my favorite CD's in the world!  I admire her and absolutely love her voice!
B005544V6A|5.0|Great plot, intelligent dialogue, fascinating characters and awesome suits make this a  most enjoyable show! The legal cases are interesting and the character development is too!
B005544TRQ|5.0|Had never heard of this still I stumbled onto it on Amazon Prime. Great find and looking forward to the coming seasons.
B00BQ1D7BQ|5.0|I am and always have been a big Stephen Stills fan, so it made sense after hearing The Rides new cd, that I would now become a HUGE RIDES fan too.  Stephen has never sounded better, Kenny Wayne shreds like he's channeling Stevie Ray, and Barry adds just the right amount of flavor to top off this years new \\"amazing group\\", (cause super group just isn't good enough)!  I highly recommend this to all Stephen, Kenny & Barry Fans, as well as fans of the blues, rock, and just plain great music.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Had never heard of this still I stumbled onto it on Amazon Prime. Great find and looking forward to the coming seasons.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Honestly, reading the synopsis I really didn't expect much out of this book.  I've heard rave reviews about it though, so I thought I would give it a shot.<br /><br />I'm glad I did I read this.  I had the hardest time in the world holding down my tears.  I'm not one to cry but if this book doesn't bring you to the brink of tears at the least, you're reading it wrong.<br /><br />Great Character Development, Intelligent Writing, Nice Plot.
B00C1CO0XS|4.0|When I first heard a cut from this CD, I thought it was from an undiscovered Nat King Cole session--Benson is that good.  I don't care for the female vocalizations on the album, but Benson is really channeling Cole on this album.
B003VANOFY|4.0|I have been using this headset for about 2 weeks now, and so far it has been awesome.  The sound is exceptional and clear, and my fellow gamers tell me they can hear me clearly and without interruptions.  My only wish is that they had mesh or cloth earpiece seals because after an hour or so they do make my head quite warm and sweaty.  But they are comfortable and I can wear them for hours at a time without any discomfort (aside from the warmness issue.)  I have a VERY large head too.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Downtown Abbey is one of the best shows I have ever watched on PBS!  I was surprised and saddened though that they killed off Matthew after he and Mary finally go married and had a baby.
B00AZ7V0W0|5.0|All of the films look and sound great! It is packaged together nicely, and looks great on the shelf. It was a blast seeing all of films in stunning HD with crystal-clear audio. If you love Freddy, then quit waiting and buy this!
B00ECU2RGY|4.0|This movie was not what I expected. There was a great plot twist and the cinematography was incredible!. Don't want to give anything away....go watch it and enjoy!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I am a Kindle fan and user. Love the app and that its user friendly as well. No complaints ever!!
B003V6L94Q|5.0|My wife and I love his music, turned up loud whenever we travel or at home especially now when it is vacation season..
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I loved it, felt as if I were in the era myself.  By far, my best read of the summer
B00AALHW6Y|5.0|Good music for easy listening while traveling on vacation or even listening to at home. Actually great listening anytime anywhere.
B000FFJYCU|4.0|Good race movie.  Love anything with James Gardner.  Saw it at the Cinedome in Hollywood when it first came out.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Neil Gaiman  has  written another Wonderful  story about  childhood, magic, and  growing up.<br /> I read this in one sitting. I had to , it's that good.<br /> Recommended Read !
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|This app is very restful and soothing on the mind. A good app to unwind to. I find it easy to do.
B006P0FIGU|5.0|In looking at a page from a different age what do we find? A king weak and<br />vain maintaining his authority through the wits of others. His Prime Minister<br />Cardinal Richelieu is the real power. Richelieu: Subtle, cunning, utterly<br />ruthless he has to be, everywhere there are conspiracies, plots and<br />counter-plots, Powerful factions working always for their own self-interests<br />only pretend loyalty to king and country.<br />Into this strange mix rides D'Artagnan, young swordsman extraordinaire. No<br />pretender this prince, he carries a letter of introduction to the captain of<br />the king's Musketeers. It is his wish to become a Musketeer.<br />Could a man wish for more? The Musketeers are the elite among military<br />companies and enjoy royal favor.
630529142X|4.0|If you like Adam Sandler, this is a must-have.  My favorite is his mother and her many meal choices.  The father isn't bad either.
B003YK42LQ|4.0|Kings of Leon continue to improve and mature. This cd doesn't have the hits of the last one, but may be better overall.
B0081JPTCQ|4.0|I think its a great app, and since I don't have any personal info on my tablet, the permissions didn't bother me. Honestly, it is super easy to use and handy. I use this on a daily basis. I took away a star because the permissions were kind of creepy...
B00969GFFU|5.0|BIG, BIG entertaining story.  Compelling and fully fleshed out characters.  I LOVED THIS BOOK.  I think Franzen must have experienced the &#34;finding the ring&#34; part -- how could you write that without getting your own hands in?????  See what you think.
B004SD5GZ4|3.0|When I open a document I'm offered two ways to view it. One is with the application that was installed on my Kindle when I purchased it and the other is with the Adobe Reader. I see no difference only that now I need to select an app before I view the document.
0060936223|4.0|the rest is great.  Young adult story was fantastic, even though someone should make a drinking game out of how many times she refers to &#34;Rimbaud&#34;.  Puhleese!!!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I was using the FB app that came with my Kindle and didn't realize how limiting it was until I installed the new app. Now I can share articles and pictures, mention friends and family by name. Virtually, everything that I can do on my desktop computer.
B005IQZB14|4.0|The book kept my interest.  I could somewhat identify with the character concerning her Mother dieing.  It is a challenge when one's Mother dies.  I would never hike 1100 miles.  I give the author a lot of credit.  She was believable and I liked her.  I really liked the book.
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|I loved the characters and storyline. I sometimes found all the different personalities difficult to keep track of , bur this did not take away from my enjoyment.<br />This compares favourably with his previous books
B00DH1G7DS|1.0|Why do I need to have internet access to play sudoku?  Defeats the purpose of a game like this.  Can't play on an airplane or when out of cell service, which is when I would most want to be able to.
0375869026|5.0|This book was a reading requirement for my 7th grader and she enjoyed it.  It helped her understand more about bullying.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|A compelling storyline and good production make this a must see show. If you liked the first season you'll love the second season.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|don't use it much mostly just to share pictures with the kids and pass along birthday greetings to certain people.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Amazing storytelling with well developed characters.  While some of the subject matter is difficult at times, the author handles with grace and presents a compelling story that is definitely worth the read.
B007W4OZ76|3.0|I have found I do not use this very much so the price was right for me to down load it!
B009WO7NQO|5.0|awesome awesome so awesome as you can see I love this game just beat boba's jet packs missions why anyone would hats this game I do not know. get the updates if you did not do already did again awesome get this app love this game love the movies can't wait for episode 7 awesome
B007RQ6WCA|5.0|I just wish I had more free space. I started using skydrive too, for my school work, because I was running out of room.
0345529057|5.0|The quality of the books is very good as compared to the price. The content of the books is.. well.. everyone knows.. it's marvellous
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I fell in love with this book. It's both funny and poignant. Highly recommend, just seriously have some tissues nearby.
B00117P0HE|4.0|This movie is full of action and that is awesome, that is what most people love about this franchise. Where is the story line though? The new character editions are great but I wanted more details. It seems there is always a gleam, chance of hope and then cliff hanger and the movie ends. After movie number three I was hoping for more answers by now.
B006P4FBUE|5.0|My grandson wanted me to  try it son so I did and he really enjoys it. He is 11 years old.
B009GED3HS|5.0|Although I love the cast of (HIMYM) it is season eight and the foreplay, is like enough already. I hear the Mother will be in season nine the last season, but i am sure they will barely show her and still drag it out. Oh well at least the cast is Funny and the Jokes are many.
B004SUWR2C|5.0|we have played the card game UNO and wanted to try it on the kindle. everyon seems to enjoy it
B001YYQ9SS|5.0|I loved this movie. I have the original Advent Children and love it, but the extra material added in this version filled out the story so much better. And the graphics were beautiful!
B000000WCV|4.0|i was just interested in having the music for the car, so so long as the software is intact, i did not really care much about the box or the sleeve. good intro to DP. Will try a second album.
B005544TRQ|4.0|It is an interesting show full of tense adventure.  More importantly are the characters who i find quite interesting and the stereotypes make important points. For instance, the role of a lawyer is to win and is merely a mind for hire.  It is not important who is morally correct but we must all draw certain line.  So there is always something to think about.  This is unusual for a TV show.
B008OOYALE|4.0|This game is awesome. My favorite part is breeding unknown dragons and evolving them into suprisingly differt looks.<br /><br />The only thing that's annoying is that I named my lvl 5 forest dragon &quot;Lil'&quot; and it keeps switching to &quot;Lil/'&quot;.<br /><br />If you fix that bug, 5 *
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|Dave Grohl did a good turn with this documentary, and both archived and saved one of the most iconic recording consoles, ever...the Neve board at Sound City.  What does that mean?  Watch the DVD...I enjoyed the hell out of it!
B005M2A4D4|5.0|This was one  of the best series.  It had a ton of River Song, the doctor, and his ponds!  Love it so much!
B004XZ99LO|4.0|The 3D and acrobatics is incredible but the story is pretty silly.  It's great to show the grandkids when they come over.
B003FSTN5C|5.0|Perfect casting, interesting plots, and every episode is interesting.  Dom's death made me cry more the Kate's did in the original NCIS.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|I was so pleased to learn that I could download the Kindle ap to my Galaxy S4 and it works great.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|This movie is made of awesome.  I saw it so many times in theaters and I watch the Blu-ray all the time and I still haven't watched it enough!
B00B4804KS|5.0|This is the perfect movie for 3D.  It is so real that the dinosaurs seem to come into the living room.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Greatest movies of all time.  I love finally having the whole set in a format that I won't constantly have to be updating.  Plus I got it at a great price.
B006LSZECO|2.0|Two thirds of the plot held my interest; the last third was too convoluted for my taste. Don't waste your money on it.
B004G6009U|5.0|The story is wonderful and the music is lovely.  I never get tired of watching it.  Maximus and Pascal are hilarious.
B0074QGGK6|5.0|So many great usable ideas. I'm already feeling more connected to my creativity, and feel I have a start on a road map to get back into the groove. Thank you Austin Kleon!
B005XQLBU4|5.0|I think missile defender is awesome if there were more missile defenders I would get them if they are free.
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|It might be tempting to dismiss Dustin Hoffman's \\"Quartet\\" as a conventional film about the indignities of old age if not for its clever and humorous screenplay, sublime music, and magnificent performances.  Adapted for the screen by Ronald Harwood from his 1999 stage play, \\"Quartet\\" is set on the beautiful grounds of the Beecham House for Retired Musicians, where elderly performers happily interact, sing, and play their instruments. Every year, these talented men and women put on a gala concert.  This year, the event has special significance, since Beecham needs a substantial infusion of money if it is to remain open.<br /><br />The residents of Beecham are shocked and excited by the arrival of Jean Horton, portrayed by the incomparable Maggie Smith, who has made a career out of playing imperious, disdainful, and lonely women.  Horton, a former opera singer, sacrificed her personal life for professional success. Reginald Paget (the brilliant Tom Courtenay) is appalled that he will be forced to face Jean, his former wife whom he adored--until she broke his heart.  Another source of dramatic conflict is whether or not Jean will join Reggie, the randy and wisecracking Wilf Bond (Billy Connolly is a standout, thanks to his impeccable comic timing), and the increasingly forgetful Cissy Robson (Pauline Collins), in a quartet from Rigoletto that the four once sang together to great acclaim.<br /><br />Although the ending is a bit pat and predictable, \\"Quartet\\" is still a delight--droll, touching, and an affirmation of the power of music to unite, inspire, and enrich our lives, no matter how old or young we happen to be. Be sure to watch the terrific bonus features in which the actors pay homage to their director, Dustin Hoffman.  His empathy, good judgment, knowledge, and skill impressed even Maggie Smith (who, it has been said, is not easily impressed).
B00BWBHIUG|2.0|It's too confusing for kids to play with I'm 16 and I can't even understand it it's not fun and it makes my kindle run slow

B00005N6KG|3.0|These last about 6 months with regular use and are excellent for running, especially for those of us for whom earbuds simply do not work. I have owned many pairs and have never paid more than $12.95. I see them for sale here today for $39.99 and will not be paying this new price.<br /><br />Here is my Amazon order summary for this same product, purchased 10 months ago for $9.90 shipped: [...]
B00B2V66VS|1.0|this is a viruse it makes my kindle run slow it made my phone crash everything about it I hate it I don't like the game it sucks
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|I love this series.  Very good acting. Lots of humor, excitement and suspense, with a little law thrown in for good measure.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I've tried many different bingo  games and this is still my favorite. I've never even thought about spending real money playing this unlike other games.. you get wht you need in the game plus five free tourney games every day.
B000FC1MCS|5.0|I really enjoyed this book on the kindle. I flew through it and was immersed in the story. I was at a theme park for vacation and all I wanted to do was continue this book and I am not an avid reader. All the complications for the protagonist are excellent complements to a book that points out the difficulty of getting by and having positive relationships with a mental illness. The writing style is choppy and unique but I thought that it fit perfectly with the plot.
B00C1TOTK0|4.0|At least in my copy, there were at least three scenes (chapters 10, 15, 16) in which the lighting shifted to dark and back again, usually a few times per scene.
B005KDDUVS|4.0|The novel is very well written and carries some hints as to the dark sides of the Spanish Civil War.  It also provides a trip through the most important streets of Barcelona in a way that alm,ost makes it seem like you were there.  Very interesting plot!
B002UBRFDC|5.0|A completely fulfilling read.  So much history and such rich characters.  A perfect ride through time.  I was sad for it to be over.  Read this soon...you can't miss.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Got to grips with the game, like  all the different games, kept my interest , although the items are quite hard to find at times, enjoyed playing
B003G4W49C|5.0|I first learned about Orson Scott Card after reading his book Hidden Empire and decided to check out his earlier works. I loved Ender's Game and will have to get the other books as well. I'm even looking forward to the Bean story line. Hope they stay true to the book with the upcoming movie this year.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I devoured this book. I didn't actually think I would like it even though it was on my recommendations list. It just didnt seem like my type of book. I usually enjoy tween supernatural stuff. But I was desperate for something to read so I just downloaded this and am so glad I did. I loved the characters and the story.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|THE BEST GAME TO PLAY BINGO. KINDLE FIRE. It keeps your mind alert. You canmake friends here. I purchased my kindle fire at amazon.com.
B006ZDS7CE|5.0|Great album. She not only has an incredible voice but the lyrics are thoughtful, dark at times and no bs.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I cannot get to work with my iPad. Don't believe it when they say it supports IOS. There is no app unless you are on Android. I just wasted my money. I will stick to my Apple TV which I have in the bedroom. I just plugged it in and it worked.
B004FGMDOQ|3.0|This book came recommended by friends who usually read the same books as I do. After reading it I was surprised how they raved about it. I was not that impressed. It was just okay.
B00005AAEC|4.0|Much better morally than the original edition; also, they edited out some slower scenes to fit the movie into a certain time frame, and that helps me because I want to show this in my American Literature class.  The characters entering the porn shop was the one I found the most distasteful, and that is gone. Would've been nice not to have b---- in the movie, but it's much cleaner than the original and still just as much fun!
B00CPLGGWS|5.0|I have never used any AMD processors before now. The price and 4.3GHZ drove me to try it and I love it. This processor runs great and fast!
B00985E3UG|4.0|Boy, I felt this book, if accurate, was a real eye opener.  I cannot walk by some of  the brands that are mentioned in this book and not think about how advertising can influence one to buy somethng.  Even something one may not consider having bought, but saw an advertisement he considers buying it  just to try it out.  I think I will start sticking to my grocery list.
B0050PYNP8|5.0|totally funny. I really enjoyed this film. great cast, even had a story line with a surprise ending. snout the time you thought it was over, it continued.this is one movie I will watch again.
1881273377|5.0|Gary Chapman really understand relationships.  This is a great book for everyone.  I highly recomend it, it also makes a great gift.
B0046B8GEQ|3.0|Gru was not really bad from the start of this movie - he was just trying to get the attention and approval of his mother (who is really the despicable one to begin with). You knew the girls would win him over just by being cute and crying out for his approval and love. Not sure what the lesson here is, or the point of it all. Maybe &#34;if you are cute and need some loving, even a person trying to be bad will eventually give you that.&#34;....?
B00AF82WTO|5.0|Sally hawkins &ru=penry jones create mastetful renditions of the books main chatacters.Ann is supoosed to be about 27 years old in this story, and the actors from a previous version were not as believable since they appeared substantially OLDER than their characters..not so with penrey jones &sally hawkins.<br />Saw this a few years ago on Masterpiece & needed to add them to my collection.
0689877692|5.0|I love pop up books and I love simple pop up books and this book totally meet my expectation. I love on of the page where it has some spheres and on red dot, it's so cute and adorable.
0671510991|5.0|It never fails that when I expect something in bad shape, it always is better.  And I got it before class started.
B002MS5TPY|5.0|Gets better on repeated listenings as great albums do. Give this one a try, even if you've not heard much of them before.
0375869026|5.0|The little boy in the story is funny, sad,loves his family, but when mom decides to send him to regular school the fifth grader gets a real taste of life. Do we judge people by their cover?  Kids can be cruel. I am so glad he did not give up. I cried and laughed, I would<br />suggest this book to young and old.
B009QW7YEI|5.0|This is definitely one of the better bond films. There was enough dry humor and action to keep me entertained.
B002S0KB1S|5.0|Ozzy should be dead! Very interesting and well written, it shows a behind the scenes, warts and all life of a rock icon.Funny, from cover to cover. A `must read' book.
0321934962|4.0|The book is an easy read, and shows you how to get to the next level with your D7100. It provides sample photos with their specs, which I find helpful
B001C5ZR1E|5.0|Just few words about this vinyl edition - perfect pressing (180 g), clear and dynamic sound ... wish there will be more vinyl albums like this one.
B003H4I4JU|5.0|brilliant, demosthenes hierarchy of sentience is my favorite concept out of this book.  can't wait for the next one! blah
B00CBRH4YU|2.0|I like/love  many Terance Malllick  movies including Tree of lLfe and Days of Heaven.. This one is a loser--romantic drivel -- don't waste your time
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|Bruno Mars. What else can I say? Listening to this CD is truly a pleasure. It is just simply fabulous!
B00CWV8TIU|4.0|While this movie is a little slow-moving, it has enough twists and turns to keep your brain engaged trying to figure it all out. Rooney Mara was incredible... she played such a manipulator and you really didn't realize it until the end. My husband thought the movie was &#34;meh...&#34; I enjoyed trying to put the puzzle together.
0375869026|5.0|Our church created an inter-generational discussion around this book. Many adults and children read it. During the first three Sundays in August (2013), we brought in speakers to talk about issues of 1) parenting a special needs child and 2) bullying. The final session, the children and adults acted out precepts which we created through the reading and discussion. It was an awesome program based on an awesome book!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Could not put this book down. Have recommended to all my friends and to two book clubs. What would you do if confronted with the letter that the heroine was?  And if you did read the letter, what would you do with the information?  A real subject for friends to discuss!
B00DUGCLY4|3.0|too easy. it doesn't even take time to guess these, not difficult in any way. a little addicting though, you might play it for a bit before you get bored
1451626088|5.0|\\"The Kingmaker's Daughter\\" by Dr. Philippa Gregory is the third book in the famous Cousins Wars (also called the War of the Roses) trilogy. The three excellent volumes are \\"The White Queen\\" telling the story as seen through the bewitching and beautiful eyes of Elizabeth Woodville. Elizabeth was the first English commoner to become queen. Elizabeth was the wife of Edward IV the Yorkist King of England. (<br /> Two of the White Queen's sons Edward Prince of Wales and his younger brother Richard were imprisoned in the Tower of London by Richard III. They were never heard from again! The second novel in the trilogy is \\"The Red Queen\\" recounting the exciting life of Margaret Beaufort the thrice wed woman who became the grandmother of Henry VII. The third volume is \\"The Kingmaker's Daughter.\\" It tells the story of Anne Neville. Anne and her sister Isabel were the daughters of Lord Warwick. Warwick had worked hard to make Edward IV the king. Warwick, though, later died in a rebellion against Edward IV. His oldest daughter Isabel was wed to George a younger brother of Edward IV. George was beheaded for conspiring with the French and seeking to seize the throne from Edward. Isabel was an ill queen but had a strong will. She would suffer many tragedies in her short life.<br />  Anne Neville also had a difficult life. She was married to Richard III who was slaughtered at the battle of Bosworth Field in 1485. As a result of this defeat, Henry VII was crowned the first Tudor king founding a powerful dynasty. Henry VII choose as his wife Elizabeth Woodville the oldest daughter of the first Elizabeth Woodville. Their marriage ended the War of the Cousins.<br />  Gregory does her historical research and writes fascinating tales from English history. Her concentration is on power politics seen  through the eyes of powerful women clawing to the top of the ladder. These fifteenth century women had to survive in a man's world. Their lives were difficult and demanding. Gregory's prose is riveting. Many viewers of \\"The White Queen\\" BBC series now running on the Starz cable network should turn to the Gregory novels to deepen their understanding of the complex women and tragic times in which they lived.s riveting.

B008602KQI|3.0|I chose this rating because while the idea does have some historical precedence for possibly happening, it is still pretty far out into fantasy land. Some of the things they did seem contrived. But it was good acting and entertaing.
B008602KQI|4.0|nice movie, good quality. I would have preferred a better quality but that was OK. Sound was also pretty good.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Great story but felt like the author ran out of steam and didn't know how to end the story.  Disappointing ending.
B005544TRQ|5.0|So entertaining!!!!! I look forward to watching an episode every evening and the streaming from Prime is perfect.  The series is hilarious!
B004X6PRO6|5.0|The story lays bare the truths and lies of life in North Korea.  Jun Do, the Orphan Master's Son, evolves from a non thinking almost robotic human to a man with a compassioned mission.  It's the story of his transformation that draws you in - perhaps it is inevitable that good triumphs over evil - or at least we want to believe it is so.  Nonetheless, this is a story of love, test, bravery, perseverance, honor, and hope. The story was so captivating I didn't want it to end!
B001F9Y2CM|5.0|After listening to this set of albums I was surprised at how many songs I really liked and, a few I didn't even know were ABBA songs!<br />Super deal for this price.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|My two year old has fun watching  the fish and collecting coins. I enjoy building the reef too :) the graphics are beautiful and the music is very soothing.
B003K1EYM6|5.0|I bought one for my daughter last year and she loved it. My step daughter kept borrowing it so I bought a second one for her and she was thrilled.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|The device works fine, only in the 2GHz WiFi band.<br />It just provides a way to stream youtube to your tv, no other free content and no way to see your own movies or pictures.<br />These features existed in the original software release, but were removed later on, so more development goes into taking away features than into adding new ones.<br />Chrome on Android cannot stream on it.<br />In my opinion, its like most of the other botched Google projects, based on a good idea but killed in its infancy by corporate greediness.
B008ZOHCKE|4.0|Love the sellection of notebook cover.<br />Would get a 5 stars if notebooks were able to move to different location
B003G4W49C|5.0|Not just for kids! Would make an interesting tv series with potential for numerous side threads. I can't wait to read more.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Great app, very easy to use and awesome to play. I love that you don't need to wait the full time to collect your money, you collect what is earned in the time waited instead of waiting. My one year old loves to collect the money and make the dinosaurs move. Awesome app, greatly recommended :)
B0081JPTCQ|1.0|I would caution against installing this application. It acts like spyware and malware. The permissions it requires is ridiculous. Avoid this one for sure.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|On the edge of my seat at every episode and then can't go to sleep due to super adrenelan rush!!!
B002ZG976U|5.0|I enjoyed this movie.  Cher was great and Christina gave a wonderful performance for never acting prior.  You will enjoy if from start to finish.
0399226907|5.0|This book is super cute. My child loves looking at the beautiful pictures. I would recommend this book. Thank you.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|great app. use for most of my reading<br />I like how I can purchase and then read my books in kjndle
0689835604|5.0|This book is adorable! My 4 month old loves it. Weve been reading it since for a while now and it always makes us laugh. I would recomend this book.
0345525558|3.0|This novel is a good beach read.  The idea of communicating with flowers is lovely. The main character is such a sad case, and her story is somewhat suspenseful, but also a bit far fetched.  Some things just happen to happen.
B00DOPEGAS|1.0|I purchased this loom from our local Toys R Us.  It's awful.  It's hard to navigate. Hard to hook the bands over the posts because they have such a prominent hook on the tops.  And the instructions are dreadful.  The first, and easiest, bracelet option has full instructions and is easy to follow. The others have instructions that are vague, misleading and, in some cases, completely unfinished.  They just stop...mid-bracelet.<br /><br />I returned this item and went out and bought the original RAINBOW LOOM (found on Amazon here [[ASIN:B00DMC6KAC Twistz Bandz Rainbow Loom]]).  It has instructions for just the most basic bracelet, however, it is far superior.  The posts are much easier to get the elastics on and off.  The elastic are much easier to see since the loom is clear (and not hot pink) in color.  It also has a removable center section so you have many more options for designs.<br /><br />I found the far best way to get patterns for different bracelets is via YouTube by searching \\"Rainbow Loom Tutorial\\".  Obviously not all tutorials are created equal, so you may have to weed through a few duds to find a quality video.<br /><br />This product is really best for 8 to 9+ if you want kids to be able to do this without adult assistance.  My 6 year old has excellent fine motor skills, but she still needed my help.  But my 8.5 year old seems to be the perfect age to be able to learn the basic stitch on her own and then build on that skill.<br /><br />After replacing our old loom with the Rainbow Loom and watching YouTube we are happily making bracelets.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Watching the cast emerge from WWI and witnessing the substantive changes in this royal family have been thought-provoking - the series does a wonderful job of showing us how war really destroys and renews, including destroying some things that really needed to be destroyed (and are replaced by a brave new world).
B006FPFTMS|1.0|I was trying to use it for scanned newspaper-format, three-column material.  The viewing method is too cumbersone,  There are no shortcuts that let you jump around the page, as does Perfect Viewer.
B00ARF93AQ|1.0|Bad movie, did not enjoy it at all.  I have no recommendation, and I will not review any more movies.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|Much better than my cheap 500mA USB charger that did not stay in place and finally stopped working. I only wish there was port indicator on the side (I use it rotated 90 degrees so that I try to remember: tablet port on the left, phone port on the right, I use microUSB cables for both). Nothing a marker pen couldn't fix.
B004QL7K6G|5.0|This movie is hilarious.  Reminds me of a few hypocritical hippie zealots that I know in real life.  Anyhoo, the rest of the cast make up for the over rated  Jennifer Aniston and Paul Rudd.  The only part of the movie that I dislike with a passion in the scene where Rudd is rehearsing his sex line in the mirror...L A M E!!!  They could have left that one out.  Otherwise good movie.
0385504225|4.0|The Lost Symbol follows the same blue print as the other Robert Langdon novels.  Modern mysticism + urban legend + enough plot twists and turns to make a mountain road jealous.  Although I was able to figure some out and was wrong on a couple of guesses the main twist at the end I never saw coming.  If you like's Angels and Demons and the Davinci Code you'll like this one as well.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|Great history in the form of a portrait of several families.  I am from  Buffalo and the descriptions of places, geography and distances between locations are most accurate.  I lived near or on some of the streets mentioned.  I am impressed with the research done for this series and wait with anticipation for the third book.
B000FC11A6|2.0|What I liked:<br /><br /> - Lots of &#34;geek&#34; content describing things in interesting ways.<br /><br /> - The espionage story line was really cool.<br /><br /> - Fascinating thoughts about how Axis vs Allies was like Ares vs Athena, and that the pattern keeps repeating itself throughout history.<br /><br />What I didn't like:<br /><br /> - It was like every chapter started with a mystery: &#34;Which storyline are we switching to now? How much time has passed? How the heck did we get here?&#34; For example, one chapter closes with a guy driving in California. The next time we pick up on him he's surveying some wreckage of a house. You have to infer from the clues that an earthquake happened, and this is his own home. At the beginning of each chapter I felt like playing an old computer game, &#34;You see nothing, hear nothing, smell nothing, taste nothing, feel nothing, and aren't even sure who you are.&#34;<br /><br /> - Book started slow - got about 1/3 to 1/2 through it before it finally felt like it was moving. One of the characters is walking on carpet that is so plush that he feels he's shuffling wearily through tall grass. I said out loud, &#34;Kinda how I feel reading this book.&#34;<br /><br /> - The ending had some oddness that didn't make sense to me, and was abrupt. I really don't care for lack of resolution.<br /><br /> - The language is pretty bad -- lot's of swearing, I mean. I realize that in WWII people talked pretty coarsely, yet even so it was a little overboard for my preferences at times.
B000EXZDOQ|5.0|In my opinion, this is the best album Whitesnake ever recorded.  A must-have if you are a true Whitesnake lover like myself.
B00E8B1P9M|4.0|plenty of action, explosions, story was good. was just into it from start of the movie. hoping there's another coming out soon.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|I really liked this film.  The story line is intriguing and portrays a different view of the atrocities during the holocaust.  The setting in this movie is Paris France and is brought to a personal level by the role of Kristin Scott Thomas and her quest to unravel the mystery of what became of a young Jewish girl and her family who were sent to camps by the French.  This quest brings out secrets of her husband's family that have been kept since the war and affects the whole family. I would classify this movie as mystery/drama and it will pull at your emotions and have you thinking about it for days after viewing it...at least I did.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Hopelessly addicted... what can I say??  I love it - the characters, the drama, the humor... and... I really hate that Matthew died... where will they go next?

B008JFUR10|5.0|I first saw this movie in theaters and it was great, The Jaegers and Kaiju look totally awesome, the battles were epic!!, and the movie itself did remind me of Neon Genesis Evangelion. If you like Mecha anime and Godzilla, its highly recommend.

B00A285OOW|4.0|Henry Tudor does not have the luxury of marrying for love; he knows he must marry Elizabeth of York to unify England. Elizabeth is still in love with the fallen Richard III and all of England hopes for a missing heir to the throne. Henry must do his best to woo Elizabeth, he may have power, but he does not have the loyalty of his subjects. Slowly, Elizabeth begins to fall for Henry's charms, but nothing is assured as a young man and his army appear from nowhere, the man claiming to be the lost heir - and Elizabeth's brother.<br /><br />Gregory is the queen of medieval story telling. She has set the standard by which all other writers of the genre will be measured. The White Princess is yet another jewel in Gregory's crown.

B008KMHFJY|5.0|Being a fan of Maryses blog, Travis being one of her all time crushes, I finally moved this book up on my TBR list. And I loved it! Couldn't put it down, almost did an all nighter last night - forced my reader down at 1am and then laid awake thinking about it... Sigh!! The beautiful, angsty words that Travis spoke when he was declaring his heart to Abby, just broke be up. I loved the forming friendship, the falling in love, the angst and complications. Loved the testosterone family get together with Travis'es dad and brothers. Loved the best friends, which brought relief and added interest to the story. Beautifully written, and reached my heart.
B00EOO55GW|1.0|I'm so disappointed to write this review with what I'm about to say. I've always been an A7x fan and absolutely love their heavy drumming, guitar, and vocals. I had such high hopes for this album but as soon as I heard the whole album I was ashamed to call myself a fan. What happened here? M. Shadows sounds vocals are lackluster and feels like he put zero heart into this album, the songs all have the same old school metallica sound which is good if this were metallica but it's not. I feel like since Jimmy has passed they have lost their creativity. My girlfriend said she wanted to cry after hearing it because \\"it just doesn't sound like avenged sevenfold.\\"  It's not a terrible album it's just not an A7x album =( Someone please find them a muse because I want avenged back!
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|This game is cool. This game is fun . I really like it. The only problem is  the vehicle prices...too high.

B00B2V66VS|3.0|In this game you run from big monster ape thing and it's pretty much just temple run 1 but with new areas to run. The reason for the three is you have to buy new people  with the coins. They should add mote coins or  develop in game challenges to earn the people in temple run 3. I get in the  2-3 million area every time I  play and I only  get about 2,000 a game, and  the people cost anywhere from 25,000+.
B00BAYLRNO|4.0|On December 26, 2004, the third-biggest earthquake ever recorded struck the Indian Ocean bottom off the Indonesian island of Sumatra. Some 500 miles to the north, at the Orchid Beach resort in Khao Lak, Thailand, the Belón family was enjoying their second day of vacation. Soon, however, they and millions of other unfortunate individuals would experience the one of the most destructive tsunamis in history. A tsunami is a great ocean wave generated by an earthquake. In this case, several waves struck the entire coastline of the Indian Ocean, leveling everything in their path and killing as many as 315,000 people. This movie, in a 10-minute sequence of astounding, terrifying detail, depicts what happened to the Belóns when the tsunami overwhelmed the beachside resort. Their ordeal is portrayed by the fictional Bennett family: Henry, the husband; Maria, the wife, and their three sons, Lukas, Thomas and Simon, as we watch their impossible story unfold. Director Bayona and his crew created what might be the most realistic depiction of a waterbourne disaster ever brought to the screen. In the process, we get to see two great acting performances - one by Naomi Watts as Maria, and the other by 16-year-old Tom Holland as Lukas. Together, they're as riveting as two actors can be, portraying people literally swept away from their quiet, normal lives by the immense power of nature. You might never be able to forget them.

B004LQJPEG|4.0|This gritty, realistic police drama boasts two superlative features: Don Ellis's icy-cool music and possibly the greatest car chase ever filmed -- done entirely without optical effects. Based on a true story, Gene Hackman plays Harry \\"Popeye\\" Doyle, a New York City detective on the trail of a large heroin shipment from France. He and his partner, \\"Cloudy\\" Russo (Roy Scheider, distinctive in an early role), stake out the suspects, but when one of them tries to assassinate Popeye from an apartment rooftop, the chase is on, with the would-be killer attempting to escape aboard one of New York City's elevated trains, and Popeye down on the street in hot pursuit in a commandeered Pontiac GTO in the middle of city traffic. Friedkin mounted his cameras low and on the front of the chase car and transit train, and the effect is electrifying: Even watching on video, you may find yourself holding onto your seat. The veteran Spanish actor Fernando Rey plays the French drug kingpin with a wicked gleam in his eye, and the real Popeye -- named Eddie Egan -- appears in a cameo as a detective supervisor.

B00CATONCA|5.0|This boxed set is as awesome as it looks!  Just got mine assemled and love it. BUT one major flaw! The box of dvds slides in behind the tanks and is so tight you cant get it back out! No finger hole on opposite side to push. Had to use a knife and pull out the top tank. I will not store the boxed set there because every time u insert or remove it the plastic scrapes the box and eventually will ruin the pristine look of the boxed dvds. That is my only complaint with this set but would still buy it!  Just store the dvds elsewhere!

B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|Interesting popular history by a biblical scholar with limited credentials which reads somewhat like a thesis positing the historical Jesus as a revolutionary. Hesitated to pick this one up because of the criticism the author is not a biblical scholar of repute. However I thoroughly enjoyed the work and found his thesis an interesting one. I think the book has merits on the case he makes alone and that it is best left there. I learned a lot from the book and the author impressed me with his scholarship and understanding of New Testament history. It helps of course that I have no issues with viewing Jesus through a historical lens. What impressed me most about the book is the courage it took to write and publish it in the face of the tsunami of criticism from the evangelical Christian following that was sure to occur after their earthquake of indignation that someone who is not a Christian dared to write about an historical Jesus without taking his divinity for granted or even to account. No matter because Jesus of Nazareth will continue to confound both those who write about him and their critics.
B006RXQ3GO|1.0|I do not see anywhere on this site how to request help or a refund.  I have tried streaming this movie 3x in last 3 days and now it does not appear in the Video Library.  Why does it have to be so complex?  I'm sure the movie is great, but that doesn't help if you can't watch it!!
B00DW5IM9Q|5.0|So sings Dylan in a beautiful solo piano version of When I Paint My Masterpiece that closes out this collection.<br /><br />And so it is. The haunting, unadorned and authentic work that appears on Another Self Portrait certainly seems like a masterpiece as over and against what was actually released in 1970.<br /><br />Dylan's unfortunate later penchant for not releasing some of his best work (think Blind Willie McTell and Foot of Pride from Infidels) seems to have gotten underway at this time. In this sense, Greil Marcus inadvertently had it right in asking, \\"What is this ____t?\\" in the famous 1970 Rolling Stone review of the original Self Portrait. The release at that time of the honest, unadorned traditional songs that we now hear for the first time would have been a tour de force. Better late than never...<br /><br />Anyway, setting revisionism aside, let's look at this current and excellent release.<br /><br />Of the 35 tracks, the majority are from the Self Portrait sessions. These include versions of songs that were released, heard here without the often ill advised overdubbing, as well as a number of other songs in a similar spare style that should have been released, but were not. Apart from the Self Portrait material, there's some great stuff from the New Morning sessions later in 1970. In addition, there are several alternate versions of Nashville Skyline content, a couple of great live recordings from the Isle of Wight, and a smattering of other work from the 1967 - 1971 period.<br /><br />Here are a few of my favorite cuts:<br /><br />Went to See the Gypsy - The demo version with just Dylan and David Bromberg on guitar is faraway, haunting, and wistful. It sounds true to the lyric in a way that the urgent delivery of the released version misses almost entirely.<br /><br />Pretty Saro - While Bob is known for many things, I've always felt he was at his best singing love songs. This one is astonishing; a mellifluous and lyric expression of lovesick longing. Anyone who says that Dylan can't sing should listen to this. His voice here manages to express something that is almost inexpressible.<br /><br />These Hands - Johnny Cash covered this great Eddie Noack number; why didn't Bob's beautiful version make it onto Self Portrait?<br /><br />Working on a Guru - A hard driving 12 bar blues with - in a sublime irony - George Harrison delivering guitar riffs sounding more like Mike Bloomfield than the Maharishi following former Beatle. Dylan calls out, \\"Play it one time\\", and then, obviously having a whale of a good time, \\"Play it again\\". Harrison laughs a lays down an additional series of hot licks.<br /><br />Copper Kettle - Stripped of the syrupy orchestral and choral overdubs this song is a revelation. There's a raw power here, almost completely absent in the original. As Dylan sings \\"Don't use no green or rotten wood. It'll get you by the smoke\\" he emits a guttural growl that'll make your hair stand on end.<br /><br />I know I'm going to be listening to Another Self Portrait a lot. It's that good...g.

B00ADZCDKM|5.0|[[ASIN:B00ADZCDKM Long Way Down]]This is a great album and a very talented new performer. He has amazing energy and puts alot of emotion into his music and is the recent winner of the Brit Critics Award for best new performer. I bought the album from Amazon UK after hearing some of his music online. The US album is coming out in September and I encourage everyone to give him a listen.
B00CATSONE|5.0|A brief description of Tesla's life and scientific contributions.<br />I learned a lot and it convinced me to read a more complete biography.
0765326353|5.0|read this waiting for the new one to come out Fall 2012, its fall 2013 still has not arrived - getting impatient!<br />Loved it but will have to read it again before the next book!
B000HKYOK0|5.0|It's hard not to be biased by my love of TOS, but even so I have to give Season 1 in regular definition 5 out 5.  The series writing and acting was brilliant throughout Season 1.  Favorite episodes in Season 1 include &#34;City On The Edge Of Forever&#34;, &#34;The Menagerie/The Cage&#34;, &#34;A Taste Of Armageddon&#34;, &#34;Charlie X&#34;, &#34;Miri&#34;, &#34;The Conscience Of The King&#34; - all engaging episodes and transporting, so to speak.  There's magic with these first serials that I don't think is duplicated on too many of shows of any genre or period.<br /><br />One thing I've noticed is that &#34;Star Trek-TNG&#34; fans seem to have trouble appreciating TOS, and they are very different in my opinion.  So I recommend just buying a few episodes from Season 1 or simply joining Amazon Prime at $79.00 for a whole YEAR (a bargain by any measure) where you can watch them as much as you want and then decide whether to make them part of your permanent collection.<br /><br />IMPORTANT NOTE:  For avid Star Trek fans I do NOT recommend the remastered/HD version.  It sounds like it'd be better quality, but all that was done was to &#34;update&#34; the special effects scenes (should as the Enterprise orbiting a planet) to a computer graphic that totally clashes with the rest of the early special effects in the main parts of the show.  The original video and audio was no better in my judgement.  I only hope the don't stop making the original episodes in favor of the HD remasters.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|I love this book. James is authentic, transparent, original and  definitely not a box dweller. Everyone should read this book.
B00ECU34ZM|1.0|Was expecting a sci-fi action movie and got a long boring movie.  Highly not recommended.  Plenty of other movies that would rank well above this one.
B00ENTDDGW|5.0|this game is so awesome cant believe its free amazing if you're a fan of neon this is the game for you.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|This book was very good, confusing at times for me only because I'm not well educated about the Kennedy assassination. Although it took me several months to finish this book due to time issues, I really enjoyed it and found myself getting lost in the pages and being able to picture everything that was going on. Definitely recommend this book! A great summer read if u have the time.
B00EOO55GW|5.0|I love that avenged sevenfold is always evolving and growing, yet you always know it's them. I love this album.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Love it. Tons of continuous fun, and  always changing so you're playing a new expedience each time.<br /><br />The only complaint I have is the inability to purchase repair points. The levels get a little hectic sometimes and it would be nice to give myself a little &quot;edge&quot;. Other than that, great game.
B00AF6MF9I|3.0|Just turned the game on again and it took over 500,000 in coins and seven hearts received as gifts from allies. Saving your game is a problem. Sometimes you return as you left the game. Sometimes you return and your progress has been reversed. You go back in time, it would seem, to before you collected money, or made weapons, or gained glory points, and all you have done is lost. I am in the top 3000 on the leader board at level forty-six with sixty-eight allies. Yet I can not enter forty-three of the sixty-eight bases to collect hearts. I lose access to more bases as I add allies. This also includes my most recent ally addition. Why seek out more? I am attacked constantly, but when I get revenge and go to invade; enemy base will not load. Most of the time if I attack and win on the world map the enemy base will not load. The Customer Care Site you can visit from settings, has these problems and others listed as things they are aware of and working on for some time. When will there be problem resolutions? If you are a new player you will not see these problems. Wait till you advance enough and see how frustrated you get! I have played this way for long enough. The subtraction of the coins was the end. If I could give a zero, I would. Time for me to quit this one and try something new.
B00011KHTM|5.0|just what I had hoped for, I was able to use a monitor as an extension of my iMac making it more useful
B005MSD6GU|5.0|I really enjoy Criminal Minds and have been a fan since the very beginning. I recommend this to anyone who likes thought provoking entertainment.

B005LAII44|5.0|would recommend to any action movie lover it's keeping the series going, some movies just don't need to have sequals. this is one of the better ones.
B001P5HI4A|5.0|this is one of the all time greats!!!!!!!! I thank you for having it availbe I had tried in the past to find this dvd movie and no one had it and I mean  no one, I am so very pleased to have seen it come out,My thanks to all whom made it  possible your the best!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

B000FP2Z1C|5.0|I was apprehensive of ordering a vinyl offline because I've hear horror stories of the postal service ruining packages and it would sadden me if I received a broken record.<br /><br />The package showed up on the first day of the estimated delivery date and in perfect condition. The record was great, I am happy I added it to my collection.
B0071XO8RA|1.0|I don't understand why this book has so many five star reviews.<br />As others have have stated if you like the &#34;Hunger Games&#34; you might like these books.<br />The writing is flat the characters are 2-D and Howey has no idea how to put science into fiction.<br />This book should be labeled under teen fiction.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft pe is the best game ever I play it 5 hours a day. The hole world is made out of blocks. I can't wait until the update 0,8,0 minecraft is awesome
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|This show is amazing. So well done, so intense. You really get into the story and the characters!<br />It can get pretty crazy so viewer discretion is advice!
B00DW5IM9Q|5.0|Am I nuts or is this one of the best Dylan releases of all time? So intimate - like stepping into a time capsule and sitting next to the guy and his guitar. Though I love and appreciate all of Dylan's incarnations, the period spanning John Wesley Hardin (my all-time favorite Dylan record) through to New Morning is my favorite Dylan period. I love the earthy, organic, stripped down sound and production of this era - the childlike simplicity of it. To me this period also finds Dylan at the apex of his vocal prowess - warm, sonorous tones indeed with great passion and vulnerability. Honestly I don't even remember what the original Self-Portrait with all the overdubs sounds like but this version is sheer mastery. Listening to it is like stepping out of this current sterile, cold, digitally conflicted world into a cabin in the woods with a cozy warm fireplace.
B004I744AS|5.0|Very useful , clean and clear, right to the point where you want to know the meaning of a word or phrase or slang.
B005PK553C|5.0|The show is so amazing! I couldn't stop watching a friend told me about it and I watched an episode and was hooked! The DVD set was great lets me watch the show as much as I want! It also came with some bonus features which was really fun to watch!
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|If this book doesn't leave you with a lump in your throat then you're a hard man indeed. Well worth the money. I simply can't recommend it enough.
B003G4W49C|4.0|Amazing setting, great story about some great characters. And the overall ending was surprising and satisfactory. Highly Recommended if you're into sci fi
B006JRY2QG|5.0|My Amazon account will not play most days- we tried the trouble shooting and it still did not work,<br />When I can get on to watch the show, it is great- when I cannot, it is most frustrating.
B004YW4L5K|4.0|It's not just a novel; it's a philosophical quest -- makes you feel like you accomplished something when you are done.
B0050R0YB8|5.0|This was on my friend's wedding registry and I just had to. They completely flipped their lids when they got it. For the same price as the LEGO Death Star, it is FAR more impressive.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I have never read a book that has packed such a huge range of emotions .  I belly laughed at Jamie's experience with his toupe.  I felt anger and grief over the orphan's treatment.  The ending left me with a heart full of hope.  I almost skipped over this book but I am so glad I didn't!
B00EE3FTNM|5.0|So wonderfully done, superb acting, editing and plot.  I only wish I could get the BBC on my home television.  I have recommended this to many people.
B00499NHLC|4.0|I've been a big fan of Sir Doyle's books for a long time.  I find this TV show entertaining, a little quirky, the right amount of humor and mystery.  I think the main actors do a good job of filling their characters roles.  I think the fellow who plays Watson does a very nice sublime job of it.  He mixes just the right amount of reverence for Holmes, plays the war veteran angel nicely and seems like he will continue to develop the character well.<br />The guy who plays Holmes does a nice job as well.  Not quite as nuanced but the character is not quite as nuanced either.<br /><br />I am also a big fan of the US series &#34;Elementary&#34; which is played out quite differently than this one, even though they are both modernized versions Sherlock Holmes.<br /><br />Again, I like it.<br /><br />Peace
0345803493|5.0|If I thought no one would know what I was actually reading even after I wrapped this in a plain brown wrapper and brought it to work I'd be tempted to try it, but I have a sneaking suspicion all that will happen is a lot of people will stop by my table at lunch and ask me something like &#34;did you ever try the one on page .......????&#34;
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Read this on the suggestion of gothic charm school and love it. Very interesting and quick read for all ages
0345803485|5.0|And I do mean a lot - it's hard to read more than one page before the most incredible, eye-popping, explicit descriptions of the act of copulation leaves you all hot and sweaty again.  I could turn into a prune before I finish this book!
0446555002|3.0|I am a long time fan of Preston/Child, having read every one of their books, starting with Relic.  I am particularly a big fan of the Pendergast character.  I must say that this trilogy has been a labor for me.  Most of their other books are real page-turners for me, where I can't wait to find out what happens next.  This trilogy on the other hand has been a slow, lumbering effort.  In particular, I felt the time in-between the three books was simply too long.  I mean, I'd already read both Gideon's books by now.  I wish they had postponed those two books, and finished the trilogy with less time between each book.<br /><br />Otherwise, I think this book did push the limits of believability.  I have to agree with some of the other non-positive comments from other readers.  For Vincent to not believe in Pendergast 'this time' is just silly.  What does Pendergast have to do for Vincent to 'believe in him 100%'?  Has he not 'proved' himself by now?  Plus, the Corrie Swanson sub-tale was simply not needed...not part of this story, at all.  I thought, based on the second book, that she would be involved in solving the overall mystery...but no.  Made no sense to involve her as they did.  The Constance Greene bit, while illuminating, was also a bit unnecessary.<br /><br />Another mystery for me was the whole notion of 'revenge' being carried out by Pendergast.  To be frank, it did not look like Pendergast was in any position for doling out vengence here, at all.  He was 'chasing the bad guys' in the beginning, but failed in his task.  The rest of the book he was pretty much the victim, always one or more steps behind, or quite simply, pretty close to folding his tent altogether.  His was not a story of 'in control and planning some deserved vengence'.  He hardly 'had it out' with the head bad-guy.  I just didn't see much 'vengence' for what they did to his wife, and himself, take place.  Yes, their evil lair was destroyed, but that was almost due to good fortune, versus calculated, planned vengence.  I guess I was just let down in this department.  I would have been fun to see Pendergast spend much of the book planning the ultimate vengence.  Oh well...<br /><br />And finally, maybe someone can help - but, what is the point of the 'name' of the book?  Two graves?  Pendergast dug one for his wife, early on... but then???  Was there a second grave dug anywhere?  If not...was the point?  Could it have been that he buried her once the 'first' time she 'died', and then a second one in this book?<br /><br />I look forward to more single-book, self-contained murder mysteries with Pendergast, maybe with Corrie Swanson as his sidekick.  Who knows what will become of his 'sons'?
0345803507|5.0|I didn't know people could actually get into those positions!  Can't wait to try a few myself (but carefully - don't want to have to explain to my pcp the real reason I sprained my back, right upper leg muscle and right ankle was that I was actually stupid enough to try that stuff at my age!)
B004UQPM4E|5.0|Forget the 14 disc DVD ultimate collectors edition as this Blu ray box set is the far better set to own. This 8 disc blu ray HD set has everything in it that the 14 disc DVD set has but with a few more extra features plus this 8 disc set is in full 1080p HD picture quality and DTS-HD Master Audio. All of the movies ( with the exception of superman 4 the quest for peace with the reason being unknown by me ) are all in 5.1 surround sound and superman returns also has 7.1 sound as well as 5.1. You can't beat this movie set at all
B000VK99Z6|5.0|I liked the story line and the lengths to which people will go be most desirable town to live.<br /><br />True irony about the ridiculous in life.<br /><br />You have to have a sense of humor to enjoy this movie.<br /><br />Paul, Shaun of the dead, and Iron Sky are comparable movies.
B00A8V3VVG|3.0|Say What?!?! I totally had to buy this because the sound quality was simply better on here than on mp3. I like most Tarantino movie soundtracks however this one only has about 3 songs on it that are worthwhile.
B0050PYNP8|5.0|I liked the idea of making an alien seem like an everyday, sacastic, and loveable guy.  Bateman does a great job as the goverment agent hunting down.  It is a fun movie to watch and enjoy with friends and family.
B00B7XGGTI|4.0|I liked it . it was as I remember it  I just wish I could download to my pc. George C Scott was a great actor.
B0073COMUW|3.0|This is a bright white light and useful for commercial and work or utility area. My need was for home use (living area); I would suggest getting a warm or soft white bulb if available.
B009AY04A8|5.0|Good game, fun to play.like most games usual search. Looking forward to second part of game which hopefully will come out soon.
0143118757|5.0|I recommend this book to anyone learning negotiation skills<br />. It is an easy read, and easy to understand. Awesome
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Oh. My. God. I LOVE THIS BOOK. I CANNOT WAIT TO READ THE SECOND BOOK!!!! Cassandra Clare, you are awesome.
B005HEPN06|5.0|This season is more about relationships and touchy-feeling issues, as opposed to the more philosophical themes in Season 3.  Very excellent, nonetheless.
B001H4K9OA|3.0|It's not as good as I remember it when to be when it first came out.  I guess I've grown up since then.  It's funny, but I've seen better.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Can't wait for the next season to start, keeps you very hooked. I have found myself rewatching 1, 2 and 3 season over and over. hurry, hurry
B004M4VSYW|5.0|That's about all I can say about this movie.  It's an incredible true story and Franco did a fabulous job.
B00005JKCH|5.0|Normally, I've only been a Batman fan, but I found an appeal to this superhero through this movie.  I have been a Spiderman fan ever since!
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|Ben a fan of Jared Padalecki since the Gilmore Girls.  He's the perfect yang for Jenson's ying.  They'd be a great comedy team as well.  Jared can play drama, si-fi and probably comedy as well.  Love to see him in a &#34;leading man&#34; role saving the world like Bruce!
0800141849|5.0|This is such a wonderful movie.  I was so excited to get my own copy finally (my mom has a copy) that I watched the very same day I got it.  It has a great message: you should connect with people based on internal chemistry because &#34;beautiful&#34; people can be empty.  This movie shows that there is someone out there for everyone, when you know someone is right and when someone isn't.
0062238868|5.0|Get this book! You will learn more than you wanted to know about sniping. Order this for your sniping wife!
B00ELIKDXG|5.0|Following the theme of 'The Firebird', this is a continuation of the adventures of Alex and Katie, aided by their magical Aunt Karina and book of fairy tales, taking us on another adventure, teaching us about friendship, magical lollipops and helping others.  Even in Russia, such stories would be the learning foundations of the desperate poor and wealthy families alike. It's part of the cultural heart of Russian people, adapted by Julia Gousseva for your children.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|So fun and addicting! I love when right after you download and open you can pick your birthday so it fits you!!
B0036S4B6M|3.0|This is an insightful look into prison life: it is descriptive, compassionate, and Ms. Kerman demonstrates quite a lot of thoughtfulness.<br /><br />I give it three stars due to the quality of writing; pardon my curmudgeonly insistence on the existence of comma splices. Rest assured, too, that I understand it's about prison and the vocabulary of choice there likely differs drastically from the Sunday morning sermon: but are so many swear words actually contributing to the message? Overall, it's a tired and weary style, poorly constructed, that masks some beautiful, others sorrowful, still others inspiring -- stories.
B003VWU2WA|4.0|As a video post-production pro, I was looking for a device to scroll the timeline and maybe even mix audio pots up and down. I haven't fully tested the latter yet, buy I love the horizontal scrolling in the timeline and in the source and master window. The build quality is first rate. It appears that the software is no longer being developed, so I hope it will still be usable for some years to come. The video training on how to use the software is okay, a little confusing, but you can figure it out.  I'm on the Mac Platform.
B00947NAHU|4.0|I enjoy the movie very much and I think most people would enjoy it as well, This movie is not for children so keep that in mind when purchasing it ...
0345529057|5.0|I have only begun reading the first book.  I have watched the entire series on Showtime and so far everything has read like the book.  I do not know how this will carry through but I am glad to have to books just the same.
B008UX2UIO|5.0|My all time favorite book!  Read it for the first time 30 years ago, and just finished re-reading it......for the 3rd time.  Just phenomenal writing; too bad for us this is Toole's last work.
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|This cast is made up of some of our most loved character actors.  It's amazing to see them as they are, the same<br />age as us watching!
B000JMKQX0|4.0|This was so much more than I expected, and so much better. I'd recommend it to just about everyone. My favorite zombie book ever.
B00AIQP9DE|3.0|this is a fun and adventurous game. lots of mystery and definately a fun time. ive been playing for an hour and haven't noticed the time fly by.
B00ECU34ZM|2.0|I very seldom fall to sleep during a movie, but my wife had to wake me up twice on this one. I'd place it at one of the 10 worse sci-fi movies I've seen.
B0060MYM7O|4.0|Was really looking forward to catching up with this season. I was very surprised to find out it came with DVDs and digital copies as well. The first season at the time did not. I was able to redeem the digital copies on iTunes with no problem, but the codes will eventually expire so if you're reading this in 2015, the codes might not work.<br /><br />One of the best production quality for Blu Ray I've seen. Only a couple of episodes per disk, but they really stand out. I've seen some bad productions in moves and TV shows on blu ray before and I'm glad to see this wasn't the case. Sound is amazing too and really pop in 7.1.
B007N8RULO|4.0|Love this game, very addictive. Hate when it shuts down for no reason.  This game equals fun. Great time killer.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I was so enthralled with the development of the characters that on a rare Saturday with nothing else to do I watched all episodes of season 3 and when it was over, I sat in  funk - couldn't believe how it ended. Wish we didn't have to wait  until January for the next episodes.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|This is handy for hiking, when you want to keep your weight low, but carry a knife or two. This is a great addition.
B00CDSVZHY|4.0|I really liked Django. It had some very funny parts to it and there was a lot of action. But this is my kind of movie. I'm not comparing it to a Tom Hanks movie or something a little more mainstream. Tarantino's movies are pretty violent and grotesque. This one was as well. The jokes are a bit raw. But again, this is my personal taste in movie. If you like Tarantino movies, you'll definitely like this.
B004UHPU5E|5.0|This is a record King Crimson fans have waited a long time for. It may be referred to on the cover as a \\"King Crimson ProjeKt\\", but for lovers of the true Crimson ('69-74), stylistically, the sound of this Crimson began on \\"Lizard\\", and had Fripp not dissolved the \\"Islands\\" era Crimson, this would have made the logical followup to that record. But then we wouldn't have had the juggernaut that was King Crimson '73-'74, and that would have been criminal negligence. So, 40 years later, this is a revelation, and maybe it's the vibe Mel Collins brings back to this project with old mate Fripp, but it plays like a more mature and cohesive sister disc to \\"Islands\\" nevertheless. The stellar lineup of this Crimson each brings his own Crimson history. Collins, of course, reed player from '70 through '72, bass player Tony Levin from the 80's and '90's incarnations of Crimson, Jakko Jakszyk, guitarist and singer who fronted the 21'st Century Schizoid Band, English drummer Gavin Harrison, as fine and inventive a drummer as Crimson ever had (somewhere from the great beyond, Ian Wallace is smiling down on him), and of course the Big Kahuna, Robert Fripp. The songwriting credits go to Jakszyc/Fripp/Collins but this is a very organic Crimson with a deeply instinctive rhythm section that undulates with insinuating drum and bass grooves, unmistakeable phrasings, melodies, and harmonies from Collin's saxes, smartly arranged and complementary guitar styles and sounds from Jakszyc and Fripp, whose sound here does not rely on gadgets and studio trickery, and his \\"soundscapes\\" schtick is most effectively implemented in a more conventional songwriting context. Though very arranged, this is how Crimson plays best, with a loose precision like the chosen conduits of music already in the room, and Jakszyc's warm voice and vocal arrangements make it all so accessible. There's a warm and relatable melancholy to these songs that's somehow familiar and sound like old friends you've missed, and theirconvergence has captured \\"A Scarcity of Miracles\\", a must for any Crimson fan. Fripp's liner notes indicate that this must have been a very joyful \\"projeKt\\", but this is King Crimson. It's all there, the darkness, the light, the unexpected, and the seat of the pants flights that capture what King Crimson captures.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|I love this show. The story lines are great. I like the way they have story lines on both the family and the staff.<br /> I can't wait for Season 4.
B00A7YZ1KI|3.0|As the final book in the series it was an ok ending. Didn't live up to what I was expecting
B0010SKSTO|5.0|I found this book to be one of the best I've read about body language. I think joe has his feet on the ground. He knows his things. I really recommend this book because it will help you to observe not only negative things as in most books but also positive movements in the other person. I like how he manage the deception part. Most of books promise you how to uncover deceit but joe will tell you otherwise. He will be honest and say. There is no way of catching lies, but I can help you to see how the person feels and according what he is saying You will have better chances to find out whether or not to trust the guy.
0812993357|5.0|this book was a gift for someone that had specifically indicated wanting to read it and therefore it was a pleasure for me to purchase as a gift and the cover is lovely
B00AF82WTO|5.0|I love these types of movies, so I really enjoyed this film.  Goes to prove that you don't need a lot of physical content in a movie to totally enjoy the story.
B007ZGO7EM|2.0|this was a great app until it began rotating on its own. it will no longer stay in the horizontal view.  i just wanted a simple calculator with big buttons.
B00874T02K|2.0|its an ok app..nothing special...go for it if your mind is undisciplined in training sense. it also has reminders and stuff
B004GYY714|5.0|I have been using TuneIn on my other android devices and had to add it to the new Kindle right away. It is my favorite music/radio app.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I love all the the fifty shades that I have read and it was a fantastic book it just had my mind going in circle how it went from one story to another but E L James is a wonderful author I look forward to reading more of your books
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|I use adobe on all my devices so adding it to the Kindle was a no brainer. Wouldn't want to be without it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|With this app it's like caring for a real live horse. Great game for kids if they don't have a pet of their own.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Inspiraton has never been so easy to find (and save for later if needed). You create your categories, you choose other pinners who inspire you to follow, everything is customizable and so easy to set up.  Pinterest is the best app!
B000031EGV|5.0|I always enjoy good action movies and that's kinda' what this is. It gets really good after &#34;Alan&#34; gets back from the jungle...
0307472590|5.0|Me encantó leer la trilogía completa de La Sombra del Viento y agradezco que hayan sido 3 libros porque me hubiera dado tristeza terminar el primero y no haber tenido más con qué continuar esa maravillosa lectura.  Son de esos libros que al terminarlos de leer te viene la pregunta si encontrarás algo igual de interesante para leer después.  Y lo que hace tan interesante a esta trilogía es que contiene tanto momentos tristes como muy divertidos, otros nostálgicos y hasta suspenso! llega un momento en que no quieres dejar de leer aunque sean las 3 de la madrugada con tal de averiguar que va a pasar después.  Muchas felicidades al escritor y ojalá nos regale pronto otro libro (o trilogía) igual de emocionantes!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Neat game. Challenging but not too hard. You have to give it some thought to get out. Good luck and keep at it.
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|I found the story different and interesting, but it was a little too strange for me.  Still, I do like the unusual and it kept my attention until the end.
B0088W6IMQ|5.0|the show has a lot of action which i like about it and carries on about on about the sg1
B006LSZECO|4.0|The style in which this is written was excellent at portraying the same events from different perspectives.  It will keep you tied into the  deviant personalities of the main characters, until you find out how similar they really are. I recommend this book for those who like a good mystery.
B00AF6MF9I|2.0|Failed to load ALLY BASE failed to load ALLY BASE failed to load ALLY BASE. You eventually tire of this game as it isnt consistent on what it promises. What's the point of gathering allies if you can't collect hearts from them? Even after you do the items are too expensive......so you can buy three tanks every 24 hours?????? Whatever. And its such a nuisance to collect them as most of the time u have to click a BILLION times.....just to have to go back, command center,allies,etc........sometimes three times for one &quot;ally&quot; you can build up your defense exclusively.....you still will be attacked and lose. Good luck and have fun banging your head into a wall for fun.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I &lt;3 this game good graphics and nice little activates to do, fun games, and ok challenges. The reason I made it a half star then 5 is due to gems costing real money (you get 1 free one each level and start with 3) the time it takes to load (it has to download then download new stuff once you enter the app) and the fact that, in some parts, it requires you to ask a friend to join the game from Facebook.<br />(Which I don`t have one because you have to be 13, man parents)
B00000D9TQ|3.0|I was a big fan of Phil Collins work in Genesis and solo work from 1980 - 85. The guy couldn't miss. Every project he was on was a huge hit. By 1986, Geneisis was getting lamer and I began to get Phil overload. I ignored his work thereafter, but couldn't help hearing some song on the soft rock stations and soundtracks.<br />Listening to this collection, I can see I was right. Everything after 1985 is soft pop crap that doesn't stand up over time. It's a more drastic turn in style than Rush or Eric Clapton ever made, but for the worse. It's hard to believe the singer on Both Sides of the Story is the same guy who led Genesis after the departure of Peter Gabriel.<br />Missing from this set is I Don't Care Anymore and Don't Lose My Number as two examples of his better rockers from the early 80's.<br />Do yourself a favor and just buy Face Value, Hello, I Must be Going, and No Jacket Required.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Good game if you are a horse person. Or for the kids to play in their spare time. I will give it a five star
B00AREIAI8|5.0|just installed this game andcwe are already addicted to it. love how lifelike. the horse is.  cant wait to explore more of the levels.
1476733953|5.0|This book held my interest.  I usually read in the evening to help me sleep but I wanted to keep reading to find out where this  story was heading.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I thought this was just going to be a quick, &#34;fluffy&#34; summer read but it turned out to be better than I expected.  I came to care about the characters and was anxious to see how it would go.  I would definitely recommend Me Before You and will look into more by this author.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|I love this game it's so fun it's really awesome I just really love it because it gets your brain thinkin real hard
140006922X|5.0|Turns out that the historical Jesus and the messianic Christ are different.  It takes a suspension of logic and an embrace of wishful thinking to reconcile them.  Jesus was a goal-driven disciple of John (&#34;the Baptist&#34;) who continued John's mission to massacre &#34;outsiders&#34; (non-Jews) and restore Jerusalem as a Jew-only city under the reign of &#34;God,&#34; with Jesus its &#34;King.&#34;  Certainly not the Jesus I was taught and sang about in Sunday school!
B00DIFARQ6|3.0|I<br /> enjoyed the play but, it could have been longer<br />It steered very easy and took a lot of concentration.
B0051OZ564|1.0|I can see why this film was put off being made.  It certainly is one the worse films of its decade and should definitely be on the 100 worse all time movies.  This movie's audience is young males who want to short skirts, based on it PG-13 rating.  This movie is definitely not for anime or manga fans or young girls.  I am fan of both and this film was boring to me.  I did not finish this film and that was no loss.  Stick to &#34;300&#34; or &#34;Watchmen&#34; for graphic novels and Japanese live action adaptations of anime/manga for short skirts and action.
B00E6Z0THE|5.0|This was a good first game of a good game series. In fact I give it a ten out of ten. I also recommend it to any gamer even those who are not interested in hidden object type games.
B0011MZOEI|3.0|My last Die Hard movie I saw was Die Hard with a Vengeance and it costar Samuel Jackson.  This movie is at best forgettable.  It does have a better plot than the next film, but that is not saying much.  I would say this film lack the blood and guts of the other films to get the PG*13 rating.  This not the only fault, but it is a main fault.  I did not feel that Bruce's character had any motivation other than protecting the geek guy who was annoying.<br /><br />Final Verdict:  Skip this one or watch if you have nothing else better to watch.  Stick to the first 3 Die Hard films.
B00DW5IM9Q|4.0|Dylan's work from this period has long been derided, in part because of Greil Marcus's review of Self Portrait, which started with \\"What is this [expletive deleted]?\\" While it's far from his best release, there are some good songs on the album. Together with Nashville Skyline and New Morning, Self Portrait shows Dylan at a period where he clearly did not seek hits; he almost had contempt for them at the time. Yet this new set shows, through demos and outtakes, that he took this music a lot more seriously than what he said.<br /><br />Perhaps it's time for revisionist history about this period of Dylan's oeuvre. I've found many very likable songs on this set, after just a couple of listens. There's a lot to absorb here, and it's worth even comparing some of these outtakes and demos with the versions that were released, but the unreleased songs show that Dylan was doing a lot of interesting work at the time. Perhaps his attitude kept him from releasing some of the better outtakes; perhaps he just didn't care. At least, 40 years later, we can hear them.<br /><br />I can only hope that the next Bootleg Series release will be from the Blood on the Tracks period.
B001AOKA3W|2.0|I finally watched this movie after years of wanting to and I ultimately didn't not miss anything for not watching it.  It was more of a Blair Witch than a monster movie.  I was expecting more destruction and feedback from what was happening in outside sources, tv and radio.  There is a little input, but the action focuses on 3 people.  I frankly was lost as to who they were and who they were looking for.  As for pace in this movie,  I get better pacing in the paranormal activity movies.  This movie is like the first time I learned to drive a clutch with rapid action scenes followed by slow talking scenes.  The previous(flashback) footage on the tape does not help the movie after the initial scenes.  I understand the need to establish the relationship with the woman that are after, but there such a thing as too much.<br />Final Verdict:  The title is as vague as this movie's plot and the monster doses not give a payoff.  Movies I would rather watch: any other Toho Film;  Redeeming factors:  this movie stars &#34;Hawke&#34; from the Wing Commander games.  The bad news: he is in only one scene.
0525478817|5.0|I'm a 66-year-old-woman, happily married but with no children. Although this book is described as being for young adult readers, I think that's not entirely accurate. The existential questions about life, love, illness and death that are asked by these young characters and their acute observations (as well as those of their parents and the other adults in the book), make this an incredibly worthwhile read for anyone who has ever loved another human being. The sharp humor--some of it of the gallows variety--just adds to the richness of the experience. I simply adored this book from start to finish and can only wish I had met these marvelous young people in person. Do yourself a favor and get acquainted with characters you'll remember for a very, very long time.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|I love playing solitaire - but it can get tedious. The &#34;golf&#34; adds a cool twist, and adds a metagame to the basic solitaire. The gopher that pops up (and stars in the movies between levels) is hilarious and voiceovers are also great.
B003G94BZC|5.0|I love Matt Smith as the doctor, although I am a huge fan of the show.  I really love the chemistry between the Doctor and Amy in the series.  I love how Matt smith can be quirky one minute and turn dead serious the next.  It took me a while to warm up to Rory but eventually he becomes an integral part of the storylines and I really like how he just takes everything as it comes.  Overall, just a great show!
0823003590|5.0|Another very helpful, this time contemporary Teacher.  I'm still working my way through and am learning extremely helpful tips that I should have learned long ago !
B008XX6J92|5.0|This album is a good mixture of  old and new songs, some recorded for the first time.. The fidelity is good and some of the recording techniques are a bit different! For the person who likes Streisand, this is definitely a buy.
B00A429YF6|5.0|What a terrific, hilarious, poignant, fun, irreverent, joyous, and completely Human tale with Wonderful acting, fantastic photographic composition and wonderful acting. An absolute Keeper. We hardly Ever buy video/dvd material. This one is an absolute Keeper.  It's hard to imagine Not enjoying this mostly hidden gem.  Although I suppose you have to be a bit strange/weird yourself to enjoy its weird-strangeness !<br /><br />david j. logan
B009NH6JRE|5.0|This is a rather unnerving production. It is horrifyingly gritty and realistic in its dreamlike unreality. There is a certain or perhaps uncertain camaraderie that holds the characters together and that bond is what draws you in. The resourcefulness of their endeavors to survive is constantly moving, redefining itself. Efforts are visually seen and we feel their angst. This group may succeed or fail to varying degrees and they may not even survive what comes around the next bend. It is somewhat never raking and that combined with the aforementioned elements is what keeps you coming back for more.
B00640UICA|2.0|I was really enjoying this puzzler and was 2/3 of the way through when it lost all my progress. I do not want to play through it again.
B0018QPPXW|5.0|Risky Business is a groundbreaking trend setting film. Tom Cruise is brilliant as Joel Goodsen. Director Paul Brickman really created something here. Rebecca De Mornay as Lana and the plot that unfolds is captivating. Musically Bob Seeger and, in tandem to the music, the indelible image of Tom Cruise still lingers today. Ultimately, the film is far from a farcical teenage frolicking romp. It is a very thought provoking film asking thought provoking questions out of the frantic fun mayhem.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I never thought of doing puzzles on my Kindle before my mother told me about this app.  I love all the variety of genres to choose from.  My favorite are the mystery puzzles.
B0024HH32A|5.0|Robert Altman's M*A*S*H is an incredibly good film and it seems timely for any generation caught up in times of war. It is definitely timely for any generation caught up in times of war. The mindset of the viewer seeing this in 1970 and then again forty years later is interesting. We became more sophisticated viewers by the time of the late 1950s and now our sophistication possibly very much tinged with cynicism through the years may look at this film in new light that perhaps was there all the time. I think that Tom Skerritt's character Duke Forrest is most effective here. By the end of the film he still had ties to reality. Donald Sutherland's Hawkeye Pierce and Elliott Gould's Trapper John McIntyre seemed trapped and outcast by their own cynicism. They are definitely the casualties of this war. It was their war, a very exclusive war they conceived in their mindset of what may have been right or wrong or simply what was.
B0099RFVXQ|1.0|I thought that this was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Too much noise, fighting and exploding bombs, etc  for my taste.
0765365278|5.0|I was already a fan of the Mistborn books from Sanderson and when I saw that he had begun his own epic world, I couldn't wait to get the book.  Definitely was not disappointed.  The Way of Kings blends together a fantastically interesting world of multiple parallel narratives, bring together so many interesting characters.  It is the journey before destination.  The magical abilities of the new world are only just beginning to unfold in this book.  Which makes it different in that all of the major characters in Mistborn were magically blessed.  In Way of Kings we're just starting to understand those with magical abilities.  The characters of Kaladin and Dalinar are absolutely fantastic and I can't wait for the next in the series.
B008MM9630|5.0|My daughter has lots of fun playing this game. It keeps her entertained while we are out and about. Fun.

B008XCM18Q|5.0|Well sad to say I saw the movie first but than when I picked up the book I got hooked
B00B7FXYJG|5.0|Love the movie,Love the Story it was Dark the way Batman movies or series should be.The Joker was awesome. It was exactly how he should be-- a socio/psychopath killer. Then ending was an awesome Twist;fighting superman was a big PLUS! :D  Everything was just awesome plot. The anime itself is awesome. Love the blood and gore the realism to it. DC comics should make animes more like this or better. :) Need an extra blood,gore, darkness and an UMPH to it.
B001IBIHQ4|4.0|very good, but not as good as the book, the book was brutal, I don't know how these guys came back and resumed normal lives, un- believable.
B009GEAPYW|5.0|Love the movie,Love the Story it was Dark the way Batman movies or series should be.I love how BatMan just broke the guy into pieces on their last fight. :D  Everything was just awesome plot.

B00846REIS|4.0|I loved the characters in this book and how they first meet.  This book flows really well and is a fast read.  Very hard to put down.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Excellent tv series.  It is very entertaining always with a good story. Addicted to this one. Main characters are very good.
B00190KZUU|3.0|decent coming of age movie for the audience of the twenties. Can benefit it more if watched twice in course of a few years.
B00APAS1MY|1.0|Paulo Coelho achieved that stage of popularity that now he can write anything (including other writers' works without even acknowledging them) and get away with that : millions of extra dollars and hundreds of thousands new fans who could swear he's the best writer in the world, when in fact, he's a borrower of other writers' writings.<br />\\"Manuscript found in Accra\\" is \\"Essays\\" (like e.g. Francis Bacon wrote) for people who can't or don't want to analyse too deeply. If it were enriched with illustrations, I would have mistaken the book, for a children's book!
B0009F2EPU|5.0|A gift to my son. There's nothing he didn't like about it. Saw the production at Lincoln Center. Loved it.

B00DAXYNEI|5.0|We enjoyed Kevin Spacey and rhe entire cast of House of Card.  I thought the unique editing style with Spacey talking to the camera was fun for all.  Of course we all know that politics in Washingto DC is not a sleazy as the characters in this show.  Right?
B005GFPZYK|5.0|One mans great insights to war, all aspects through the eyes of a real sniper.  Couldnt put it down.  Highly recommend a great read

B00BN4JQ6G|5.0|it was exactly what i was looking for. Gave it as a gift to my girlfriend and she loved it.
0061673730|4.0|A story that weaves between a father and son's adventure across the American northwest on a motorcycle and the father's profound, philosophical wrestlings (\\"chautauquas\\"). The father, is on a personal pursuit of getting to know the man he used to be, the man he sees glimpses of, the man who went insane, numbed by the unanswerable nature of his questions.<br /><br />I enjoyed reading Pirsig's work, even though it took me a bit to get into it. His delve into his philosophical questions were intriguing for me in my elementary way, but I quickly lost interest whereas Phaedrus in the book plunged further into the questions, ending up with the meta-question: What is \\"Quality?\\"<br /><br />My favorite parts: the narrative sections of Pirsig and his son riding the motorcycle. And then there were these brilliant moments of \\"zen\\" - of living life in the simplicity of the present moment, summarized by this quote:<br /><br />\\"Peace of mind produces right values, right values produce right thoughts. Right thoughts produce right actions and right actions produce work which will be a material reflection for others to see of the serenity at the center of it all.\\" loc. 4520<br /><br />Pirsig's chase after \\"Quality\\" is the reunion of who we are with who we are; it is the ability to \\"cultivate the peace of mind which does not separate one's self from one's surroundings.\\" loc. 4519<br /><br />This line, the greatest in the book, sums it up well:<br /><br />\\"The place to improve the world is first in one's own heart and head and hands, and then work outward from there. .... Other people can talk about how to expand the destiny of mankind. I just want to talk about how to fix a motorcycle. I think that what I have to say has more lasting value.\\" loc. 4528
B008JFUUIA|5.0|Movie is laugh-out-loud funny and it is one I could watch over and over!  Fat Amy is the best LOL

B00873GRU4|5.0|Howey managed to create a masterpiece in Wool, with some of the most engaging characters I've met in a while.  The prose is magnificent, the plot engaging, two very enthusiastic thumbs up! I'm immediately buying books two and three!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was a very moving easy read I loved it and I think you will too serisouly the best book
B008JFUUQ2|3.0|I bought this, thinking it would be something special.  My daughter loves it, so that's nice, but I found it to be a rehash of the whole &#34;Glee&#34; thing on the television, and what is the deal with peoples teeth being so white that you need to wear sunglasses when they look at you????  Movie was okay, but I should have waited for it to be bargain bin, at Wal-Mart.
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|Dialog was stilted and action predictable. But I was content to watch. My wife on the other hand went to sleep

B005K17RU0|4.0|Nice for when you want to have the weather for a given area, at your fingertips.  Good app, and great price (free).
B00622D3BS|3.0|It was okay.  But not very funny.  In fact, it was mostly sad.  It seems all one has to do in a film anymore is come up with a &#34;perfect&#34; ending, and ignore everything that comes before.  Most of the stuff before is about sex, which, in this case for the two lead males, has really nothing to do with love.  Then, at the end, they both discover and rediscover love and that excuses all the irresponsible behavior that comes before.  Sleeping with nine women because you want to get back at your wife is a joke in movie.  In real life, not so funny.  I do realize that some movies are simply meant to entertain, and have no redeeming value.  But this was really dumb.  I think I gave it too many stars.
B00000AFWZ|5.0|Some time ago I made the mistake of selling Pebbles Volume 1 which had all my fave tracks on it. Now I've got them and more. Hooray!
B005544TRQ|5.0|I really enjoyed the first season of this show. Although it plays fast and loose with the actual practice of law, the writing is crisp, the acting is stellar, and the story lines are compelling. I would recommend it to anybody that enjoys law-office dramedies.
B005ZMUXDC|5.0|So many parts through out make you laugh out loud. It isn't a ridiculous love story like a lot of animated cartoons featuring a princess. I just loved it and so did my 4 and 1 year old.

B00DTT53MY|1.0|Have you ever seen a TV show or movie about parasitic aliens trying to conquer humanity? If so, did you ever think, \\"If only the aliens would realize what special snowflakes humans are! If only humans would realize that parasitic brain-squids that steal unwilling victims' bodies aren't bad!\\"<br /><br />Of course you didn't. Nobody with half a brain would.<br /><br />But Stephenie Meyer did. The result: a soft sci-fi movie called \\"The Host,\\" which takes a promising idea (what if the body-snatching aliens WON?) and promptly runs it into the ground. Not only is there pretty much no plot to this movie, but it is riddled with flat characters and a total lack of any kind of excitement. Oh, and there's the romanticizing of aliens who steal bodies.<br /><br />In the not-too-distant future, the Earth has been completely conquered by a race of glowing brain-squids known as Souls (ugh), who possess human bodies. Only a few actual humans are left. When one girl named Melanie Stryder (Saoirse Ronan) is captured by the Seekers, she becomes the new host for a Soul named Wanderer.<br /><br />Immediately after Wanderer is implanted, a Seeker (Diane Kruger) tries to find out where the other humans are hiding. However, the real Melanie is still there, inside her own head -- and her memories begin to affect Wanderer.<br /><br />When the Seeker's plans threaten Melanie's life, Wanderer/Melanie escape into the desert in search of Melanie's boyfriend Jared (Max Irons), little brother Jamie (Chandler Canterbury) and the other free humans. However, they aren't too pleased to find a Soul-possessed Melanie in their midst. And even as Wanderer (renamed \\"Wanda\\") tries to gain their trust, she finds herself falling for someone who isn't Jared.<br /><br />It's hard to express just how brain-meltingly dull \\"The Host\\" is. After Melanie escapes from the Seekers, the movie slows to the pace of half-frozen mud and never speeds up again. Occasionally something dramatic will happen -- the Seeker's attack, Jamie's life-threatening injury -- but it's always neatly resolved in just a few minutes.<br /><br />Instead, most of the movie revolves around a tepid love triangle, and Wanda just hanging around the human compound, harvesting wheat and smooching teen boys. As if the lack of a plot weren't bad enough, we're constantly tortured by Melanie's screeching inner monologue, which tends to break up any moments that could have been quiet.<br /><br />And really, it wouldn't be a Stephenie Meyer movie unless it romanticized parasitic creatures -- in this case, glowing CGI squids that physically respond to love, peace and kindness. Excuse me while I vomit. Don't expect the movie to address the horrific moral implications of stealing an unwilling victim's body, either -- that would be too deep and intense for a movie like this.<br /><br />Saoirse Ronan is one of my favorite up-and-coming young actresses, and she does seem to be giving the role her all. But it's a losing battle. Though the movie assures us that Melanie is a rare and special creature with amazing inner strength, she comes across as a bland, utterly typical teen girl with no special qualities whatsoever.<br /><br />Most of the other actors are completely wasted -- the characters have no development, no history and no motivations. Even the love interests are difficult to tell apart because there's almost nothing to distinguish them. It makes the whole movie feel drained of any drama, because we don't know these characters enough to care -- when two humans commit suicide to avoid the Seekers, all I could think was, \\"Who were they again? Did they even have lines?\\"<br /><br />\\"The Host\\" is an utter failure as a sci-fi movie -- it takes a good idea and squanders it on a tepid, sluggish story that never bothers to have a real plot. Thankfully, we probably won't get a sequel.k, Jamie's life-threatening injury -- but it's always neatly resolved in just a few minutes.<br /><br />Instead, most of the movie revolves around a tepid love triangle, and Wanda just hanging around the human compound, harvesting wheat and smooching teen boys.

The soundtrack was amazing, so are the sound effects. The only thing I didn't like was after a certain point, there is no more challenge. Gold is far to easy to get, so are gems. Also, there is nothing left to strive for after a certain point.

B00ECUARO8|5.0|Lots of reviews already. I won't try to add. I will just say I loved it. Just people in messy circumstances down in a red state. The kids were great.<br /><br />Tough boys. The older one had a weakness in that he romanticized love to a fault. Thus he sadly identified strongly with the drifter who killed to protect his screwed up girl friend. It was not really so unrealistic as boys and girls go. There was plot uncertainty, yet you could be sure that the trajectory would be tragic because this was their shared tragic flaw. It was interesting to see this side by side in a boy and a man at the same time.<br /><br />The vendetta society angle was also interesting. The old man who lost a son was so intent on vengeance that you could just feel that he would also loose his remaining son in his passion-driven obsession. Again, a tragic trajectory as I saw it.<br /><br />Strong misguided passions and hard lives in a hard society. Solid film.

0618918248|5.0|Great research notes by Dawkins into the well-documented beliefs (and lack thereof) of our &#34;founding fathers&#34; and other luminaries of historical import. I have always been disappointed in our politicians, 99.9% of whom SWEAR they believe in God. This cannot possibly be the case, considering that they bubble up from the same genetic slurry that breathes life into their constituents, who have a generous percentage of non-believers among them. Be it known that I am not merely an atheist, but an &#34;anti-theist&#34; – one who not only does not believe in a god but one who actually holds that religion constitutes a serious disservice to humankind as opposed to the blessed relief it purports to deliver. Read this and find out what early American and European thinkers really thought about religion. Congressmen athiests, attention! It's time to come out of your closets!

B005K0HDGE|5.0|Just  so  you're not discouraged, it took a few pages really get into this  book but from then  on it  was  virtually impossible to put down.  As is  often the case for me, Stephen King does not  disappoint.  In fact, this was close to &#34;The  Stand&#34; in  readability.  A GREAT novel!!!  Though time travel is at the  crux of this book, it's not, by any means, the focus.  It's  about  real people in the real  world, both present and in the '60's.  Lot's of interesting  details of the lead up to JFK's assassination.  And finally, a great &#34;Steven King&#34; style  love  story that spans the ages.....literally!  Highly recommended even for  non-King fans.,,,not a horror story  at  all...just  good  science  fiction.
B0053JJLLC|4.0|Again, a well-researched book by the author. The only problem I had with it was the very graphic situations the characters found themselves in.

B00BNWWVFG|3.0|...and even after it starts it takes its time.<br /><br />An odd film that skids the surface of medicine and the problems of drugs. Take one drug to one problem and it leads to another problem. Then we have a thriller when a discredited doctor starts to see a different picture. Is he being paranoid? Is his own downfall making him clutch to straws. Then there is the patient and double victim of a terrible crime. It is a fresh prespective to see a thriller from someone else than a cop, lawyer or news reporter. It could have been a brilliant film. The problem was with the pace of the story. Slow it was but the worst part was that the introduction took up the first 50 minutes of the film, that is to say before it became a thriller. The story before that is of a seriously depressed woman coping with her life. Even once the thriller begins it is slow. There is a lot of good elements in there but it lacks the pace to make it engaging.
B003VANOFY|1.0|I'm a big supporter of Logitech products; I've always used Logitech mice, starting with the good old MX510. I currently have a G500 mouse and G510 keyboard, which I love. They even sent me a brand new G500 when my first one broke, no questions asked, and I got to keep the faulty one.<br /><br />However, these headphones do not live up to the standard I expect from Logitech. I consider this to be one of the smaller problems it has: the wireless connection is very easily disrupted. Every time someone uses the microwave in the kitchen under my room, the connection cuts out until the microwave stops. It also just cuts out for about 5 seconds every once in a while, for no apparent reason. Although, I read that this is actually due to the Logitech Gaming Software crashing and rebooting itself, rather than outside interference.<br /><br />The real problem I have, though, is that the supposed surround sound feature is more trouble than it's worth. Instead of simulating a 5.1 sound system all the time, the headphones have a switch on them, to toggle between stereo mode and surround mode. This is the cause of endless confusion and headaches. The first thing I noticed was that flash videos would only play in the right ear in stereo mode, and if you switched to surround mode, there would be a horrible, horrible bass distortion, making most videos (especially anything with extra bass, like a movie trailer) unbearable to listen to. This problem is also apparent in some games, like the recent Tomb Raider game, and any game that uses Flash technology. (I assume)<br /><br />This is where the fun started! You can go into the Windows settings for the headphones and disable the extra surround \\"speakers\\", effectively making these an overpriced pair of wireless stereo headphones, which will eliminate the base distortion (and the surround sound feature).<br /><br />That solution seemed reasonable, and I could just change it back when I was playing/watching something that doesn't use Flash (although, that got annoying quickly), except that this solution didn't work for everything. Even with the virtual speakers off, I still got really bad base distortion when playing Source-engine games, like Left 4 Dead 2 and Half-Life 2.<br /><br />By this point, the return window had already passed. I should have just returned them at the first sight of trouble, but I still thought I could resolve the problems.<br /><br />I learned that this problem didn't exist in the earlier versions of the software specifically for these headphones, before they consolidated the software for all their gaming products into the Logitech Gaming Software. It was much more complicated than just uninstalling the Logitech Gaming Software and installing the old driver software for the headphones, and I believe I was only partially successful, because this resolved the problems with Flash in Chrome and Firefox, but not Internet Explorer (and games that use IE, ie. Garrysmod) I also still only get sound in the right ear, while playing Tomb Raider, with the headphones in stereo mode, though there doesn't seem to be base distortion, so I can somewhat ignore the problem by playing in Surround mode.<br /><br />This problem has existed for over 2 years without any word from Logitech. They clearly do not care and this isn't going to be fixed in a software update. Avoid this product like the plague.(although, that got annoying quickly), except that this solution didn't work for everything.

B0094AH3OI|5.0|Traditional performances from the past of this magnificent grand opera where Verdi even beat Meyerbeer in his own game,<br />were a mixed bag of monks walking around with lighted torches, colorful Spanish crowd scenes with dances, drinking songs and soldiers marching around. They were audience pleasers, so the average people got their money's worth.<br /><br />For Verdi's 200th anniversary this certainly wasn't good enough. The very talented designer, Stefano Poda took this opera much more seriously and given it a new meaning, actually the meaning it always should have been there, but wasn't. The opera is about dark fate pursuing the seemingly helpless characters, about resentment, obsessive revenge and the ultimate destruction, such as War. There is also a strong element of Religion and people's escape into it for protection and consolation. All these elements are omnipresent in the dark hued, but monumental sets of monolithic slabs, sometimes pitch black and sometimes shining in silver hues plus a giant sculpted cross radiantly shining and dominating the scenes. So the set design and the stage movements that are very solemn for the religious scenes and disturbing, angular for the war scenes, all contribute to the real meaning of this opera.The dark hues prevail as they should.<br /><br />The musical handling is also quite different from the traditional bombast, lack of coherence that used to degrade this piece into an uneven, second rate Verdi. Much thought must have been given to the emotional content of every phrase, the proper dynamics (never too loud, but many shades of mezzoforte and piano. The orchestra, led by my favorite conductor, Gianluigi Gemetti is absolutely magnificent, starting with a fresh account of the beautiful overture.Gemetti has a sweeping, epic vision of the score somewhat reminiscent of the late, great Giuseppe Sinopoli, but he also has a light touch and grace.'Forza' now shines through like never before, into one of Verdi's greatest!<br /><br />The singers were carefully selected from the best principals of the series.I am not a singer crazy technical aficionado, I leave this to the 'experts' those who no doubt will discuss it in detail, but I have rarely heard such sustained pp singing as what leading lady, Dimitra Theodossiou produced. Other wonderful star is Vladimir Stoyanov, as Don Carlos, a many shaded characterization and powerful voice.Tenor lead is a gruelling role, but I am quite pleased with Aquiles Machado's passionate Don Alvaro. The mezzo lead, a lesser,but very affecting and interesting character here again is handled in a more original, different fashion. She is by no means the traditional happy-go-lucky gypsy girl, but a more severe Spanish lady with compassion and looming tragedy in her eye. Mariana Pencheva is memorable.<br /><br />This is a distinguished, very original,somewhat subdued perormance with none of the circus about it.

B00EI6E17A|3.0|When it had came down to Lady Gaga, she had so much in the way of noise with Born This Way, and sadly she didn't actually ignite for awhile, with hip surgery derailing her tour, but she still has thrived with triumph and with sadness, losing her influence last year who inspired her to sing, Whitney Houston. But with Lady Gaga, the question is does she ignite fire with her fans again, the answer is not really. Applause, the lead single from her upcoming third album Artpop is not really anything exciting. It feels like she doesn't thrive in the song, and instead feels like she is robotic to the rhythm. I really didn't find her song to really give it her all in the song. I think for Lady Gaga, she really needs to bring more to the voice into the upcoming record, because if Artpop is going to be another poor record, I will definitely want to boo.<br /><br />Song: C 1/2-

It was a big hit with both. Each time our grandson visits the two of them play with the dragon and figurines. Lots of memories made from this purchase. This was my first purchase from Amazon and I am very pleased.The package was new in perfect condition. I will be ordering again.<br />Sheila Brooksher
B00C7L8DM2|4.0|Gritty, handsome Aaron Eckhart in an action movie - what's not to like. I love the ability to stream movies as part of my amazon prime membership.
B0072OFM28|4.0|The dvd set arrived quickly and in brand new condition, all discs intact and usable. The series just repeats the first go around with an actor who looks younger than the first guy (who died in between seasons) and who can't act as well. The over-the-top sex and violence is still present.
B004QX07G4|4.0|Have not finished reading this book. What I have read has been entertaining & made me laugh out loud, because when I read on of her &#34;funnies&#34; it also gives me entertainment.
B000BM6AVA|5.0|I LOVE SYSTEM OF A DOWN YOU GUY ARE AWESOME AND ONE OF THE BEST BANDS EVER YEA ROCK ON DUDES
B006GWO5NE|4.0|Serves the purpose I needed it for very well. Works well with my PC as well as with the PowerFast adapter.
B000007T1M|5.0|SYSTEM OF A DOWN ONE OF THE BEST BAND EVER LOVE THEME CAN SAY THAT THERES A SONG THAT THEY HAVE COME OUT WITH THAT I DONT LIKE ROCK ON DUDES
B00CWVG1Z8|3.0|This movie could have been great! Impressed with the intro. I really enjoyed on how the movie started. It then got boring and predictable. The special effects looked good but some of the scenes seemed pointless and were there only to showcase the CGI. The dinner scene is a good example of that.
B00007E8V4|5.0|STEAL THIS ALBUM HA! I DID NA JK BUT REALLY I LOVE SYSTEM OF A DOWN ROCK ON DUDES I LOVE YOU GUYS
B0001WANCM|5.0|I love this movie and it is very well done.such good acting and I think this is one of kevin costners best films.

B00DP3IGJ6|4.0|I personally don't care for Tom Cruise, but you have to hand it to him, most of his movies deliver the action in a big way and Oblivion follows suit.  I found Oblivion highly entertaining, and unlike a lot of current sci-fi flicks today, is not as predictable as I expected.  While character development is on the thin side, the action and suspense will help you overlook it - and just when you think you know how it's going to end - Bam! - it throws you for a loop.  I appreciate that in a film.  Morgan Freeman delivers his end of the bargain and is a good addition to Cruise as far as star power goes.  I watched this film on a 2 hour flight and didn't once look at my watch. Accordingly, I give it 4 stars as it delivered exactly what I wanted - action, suspense, and great special effects.  If you are looking for something more, you'll probably be disappointed.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE ALBUMS FROM THIS AWESOME BEAND SYSTEM OF ADOWN THEY ARE ONE OF THE BEST
B003YL4KS0|5.0|This book was a revelation, and totally changed my outlook on myself. I always thought I had some weird &#34;cowlicks&#34; or light waves in my hair, and over the years I've used hundreds of dollars of perms, curling irons, gels, mousses, and blow dryers to &#34;style&#34; it and smooth it. As I got older my hair got more curly, and I hated the frizzy, undefined, shapeless mass on my head.<br /><br />My new stylist suggested I try the trial size of the Deva Curl products. They smelled great, and after using these a couple weeks, I went online to Amazon to buy larger sizes of the products and found this book.<br /><br />Now my hair is soft, shiny, bouncy and healthy. This book taught me how to shampoo, treat and cut my hair the &#34;curly girl way&#34;. I took the book with me to my stylist to discuss all I learned. She understands this &#34;curly girl&#34; method so we are team, working together (she must have also read the book).  Now I have a combination of curls and waves and I am actually proud of my hair and feel more attractive than I have in years. It's easier to style my hair each day and I am no longer working against my hair's natural personality.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book and the Deva Curl products!
B004X4R49Y|5.0|This is a fine movie that also gives a perspective of life in the period. It's the type of film that makes you interested in the real people and not just a cult of personality based on Hollywood actors.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|this game keeps you searching and makes you think outside the box for clues to escape.  it really keeps you on your toes.
B00BWJARHO|5.0|Not all sequels/&#34;prequels&#34; are bad... This was an enjoyable film. I will definitely watch the next installment. I don't know if I could survive all parts of this &#34;Ring Cycle&#34; back to back to back... when the whole project is complete.
B00B22ASUM|5.0|What a refreshingly candid and honest book.  James is open about his flaws and struggles, and it's very obvious he needed Bob to come into his life and be his \\"therapy\\" cat.  Bob in turn needed someone to save him and he surely would have died without James' care.<br /><br />I loved this book for many reasons, but most of all because it's a real life example of how pets can turn our lives around if we open our homes and hearts to them.  There are many potential \\"Bob's\\" out there, if only people would adopt them!<br /><br />Highly recommend this book!
B00C061I3K|4.0|I'd only heard Get Lucky before purchasing the album, but it's Daft Punk, so gotta have it.  It's a return to more disco themed music which makes it much more like Discovery than Homework or Human After All.  There are some pretty groovy tracks and track 3 by Giorgio Morodor explains a lot about the influences of the group.  You should get it.  There is only one track that made me ask &#34;WTF is this doing on a Daft Punk album?&#34;, but aside from that, it's really good.  I spent about 48 hours geeking out over it.
0316228583|1.0|I couldn't get into this book. I forced myself to plod through a few chapters before giving up.<br /><br />That being said: I'm rooting for you, JK Rowling. I loved the Harry Potter series. I liked the Cuckoo's Calling. This just wasn't up to par.
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|Fun but annoying that you have to keep waiting for energy to play if you dont want to spend money tobuy energy
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Excellent graphics and very fun interface. Great game for wasting some time. Great rehash of an old classic arcade title
B005LAIIPS|5.0|Although I had hoped to see Matt damon back, this movie worked for me.  Hope there will be more along this theme.
B005HSL626|4.0|I like fruit Ninja, u can play 2 players if you and a kid wana play against each other or just 1player by yourself. You can choose timed mode or arcade mode and i think theres 2 more modes i just havent played the other modes yet. Overall its pretty cool fun game.
B00B5A9FLY|5.0|I wish this wasn't the last season! A really great show full of comedy, romance, and plenty of action. A must see.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book is life changing. Read it. The Perks of Being a Wallflower is without question deserving of tremendous praise and has unequivocally earned a place amongst the classic novels of this, or any other generation.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|This little pup is a real pep pep.<br /><br />Works exactly as advertised, extremely solid and well made.<br /><br />Used it on a 3 week tour with my band, never had it out of the cigarette lighter port more than twice - it never got hot, ever.<br /><br />Shipping was fast, item comes packaged in a good little box.<br /><br />Get it!
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I gave this 5 stars because its so lightweight doesn't add any weight to the kindle that I noticed. It works great, screen is protected and it stands up for the portrait mode. Its strong for impacts when it falls or anything.
B003M6FGTE|4.0|I am probably don't fit the usual profile of the viewing audience of this show since I am over 60 but I found the characters memorable and almost all the music enjoyable.  Like just about everyone else I am experiencing a real love/hate feeling for Ms Sylvester.  I am 3/4 through season two and still enjoying.
B00009RGBS|5.0|Bought it for my teenager who really loves it!  Which needless to say, surprised me!  Great story line and the dancing and music was GREAT!!!
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I purchased it on the day it was launched. It was pretty easy to setup and I had high expectations with it. I get average 20mbps bandwidth on my Comcast internet but it is still not enough for Chromecast. It takes a lot time to buffer and one can not watch youtube videos with it.<br />Hopefully it will get better in coming days and I will be able to use it regularly.
B000USU92G|5.0|Basically says it all.  How can someone NOT  love it!!!  Lots of energy throughout the movie and has a good story behind it.  And of course, there's always all the great oldies music.  So if you're an oldies music fan, this is the movie for you!!!
B003WUYRGI|5.0|at least it helped me with homework<br />school passe  soooo i dont know to keep it or not<br />ahh summers over anywats
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I absolutely love this product. At first I just got it to watch Netflix on my TV because my XBOX was being used elsewhere, but now it's my go to media device for my television. Streaming Netflix and Youtube is only part of what this device does now and promises to do in the future.<br /><br />Current Pros:<br />-Streams Netflix seamlessly to my TV and easy control with any Android or iOS device<br />-Same with Youtube<br />-Cheap, at $35 it's a steal<br />-Something I like to call party mode, and I'm sure once developers get more into it this will take off: Invite a bunch of friends over, everybody hook up to the Chromecast via Youtube and everybody can pick what music video or viral video they want to watch and put it in a universal queue, allowing your guests to pick what they want to watch. I really hope when apps start to come out they build this into them<br />-Setup was really easy, only took a minute.<br />-Stream video files from your computer (Use Chrome to play the file and cast it to your TV)<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Lack of current providers (There's a lot of interest, though, so I bet this will change) Only Youtube and Netflix really so far. Looking forward to seeing Spotify or Pandora jump on board with this.<br /><br />I highly recommend this, especially for $35.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Soo addicting!!! I play every chance I get.  My friend is just as bad we are constantly competing with eachother on who can get the better score or more bananas.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Fun game. Keeps you entertained when you're bored. Nice to use your brain a bit... I would recommend it to a friend. Give it a go
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|Charges great, and has a nice sturdy construction.  Will charge my wife's iPhone at the same time as charging my Android phone.  The increased charge rate make a big difference too.
1451695195|5.0|Dr. Alexander has undergone an experience that thousands of others have had and have described in the modern era, with this one difference: he is a neurosurgeon, and the cognitive portion of his brain was utterly destroyed during his week-long coma so the experiences he describes could not possibly have been generated by his brain. What does this mean? It means - and Dr. Alexander recognizes that it means - that consciousness is nonlocal, not body-based. The book gives, like no other, scientific proof for the existence of conscious states beyond that of our physical bodies. In that way it supplies a remarkable confirmation of the truths expressed by mystics down through the ages. I highly recommend Proof of Heaven to anyone who is interested in an articulate and scientific overview of the whole phenomenon of near-death experiences (NDEs); and the unique nature of his NDE bears reading by anyone interested in true experiences the next world.
B007SGM084|5.0|Loved it!  I wasn't sure at the beginning but it just got better and better with each book.  I fell in love with the characters and their relationships within the story. It was exciting, adventurous, humorous, sometimes gut-wrenching, and oh yeah, erotic!  These books are everything you've been hearing about in the media and more. Listen Miss Prim, don't let the BDSM content dissuade you, this trilogy is definitely a must read!
B00AEBB8XS|5.0|Its The Warriors on Blu-Ray, what more do you need to know! lol The movie is a classic, buy it, watch it, repeat!
B001CQONKY|5.0|As I stated before, this is a great series.  The old cast members were great actors.  I just hope the new members become as solid as the old one.
B006M4F67A|4.0|Still trying to figure out the matches and why some items that seem hidden are available.  Working on it though and wasting a lot of time.
B009NY43NY|5.0|This book wrapped up agin series of adventures for Sookie.  Witty and surprising as ever.  I can't wait for more from Charlaine
B006DJ2JSI|3.0|I don't remember using this one.  If I have I don't recall if it was good or not, so sorry.
B0053O89WY|5.0|I love the show, the jokes and the setup!<br />Excellent season although I noticed that some jokes are less creative than before
B007AL48UK|4.0|is hard to get used to the rules, sometimes things seem hidden but are shown available.  Not sure what matches with what, still working on it.
B009IH0ICG|5.0|This will be the first time to use this chimney starter.  It will be great to get away from using charcoal lighter fluid.  I don't like the smell of that fuel burning into my food.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|nice game I like the consept of haveing to play games to buy and play other games. just a really cool game.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Can't wait for next season. The last episode was riveting. Did you have to kill him off perharps he can be injured
0375842209|5.0|I rated The Book Thief highly because of its ordinary human perspective on World War II through the eyes of Death. Now that is different. How often do we see Death as narrator in a book that is so lively and human! The book begins with a ten year old girl losing her mother and brother because of the hardships caused by the war. The stolen books seem to connect her to her community and to the suffering Jewish man her adopted father rescues. First, though, she develops her relationship to her father through books; the others come later. Even though THhe Book Thief\\" is rated for young people, it can be enjoyed by adults as well.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Does exactly what it claims it will do. No more no less just right. Don't really have much more of an opinion than that.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Very interesting story line.  Kept me interested through the entire movie. Well worth watching.  Not necessarily for kids under 16
B00EE3FTNM|5.0|Love this show. Thank you England for making another fantastic murder mystery series. Like The Fall, Broadchurch is more about the people and their life motivations. Smart and engaging. Watch this show!
B00ECUARO8|3.0|Movie was good - not full of language or sex - not a deep thinking movie but interesting.  Would not have paid theater prices for it but for a rental, it was entertaining.
0062255657|5.0|Beautiful condition.  Neil writes another novel, the only problem is that I wish it was longer because I want more story!
B009ZQJ1G4|1.0|What a huge disappointment!  If I could give this zero stars I would.  Not only did I waste $2.99, I wasted valuable time on this piece of trash.  I was fooled by whomever gave it 4 stars (that person should receive a full mental evaluation because I'm not sure how any sane person could think this was a good movie.)  I always give movies a fair shake but my husband and I both could not tolerate any more than 40 minutes or so of the movie and decided to cut our losses and move on with our evening.<br /><br />Horrible story, horrible violence (including animals being slaughtered), horrible acting.  I expected more from the actors in this movie.  Better luck next time I guess.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|Being a young man in my early 20s and an avid trekkie I have watched almost every episode ever, and I love them. That being said this new star trek might seem wrong to some of the older trekkies out there, but for the younger generations, its fun with the new graphics and a new story for our time, and not just a continuation of the old star trek stories, or a reboot (ughhh). I love this and would highly recommend it.
B00A285OOW|5.0|Like all of Phillipa Gregory's books I very much enjoyed this one as well. My only disappointment was with Elizabeth's character. After having read the other books of the Cousins War series, I was disappointed how weak her character was. I feel that she never really grew into herself the way other main characters did. The other women of this series were very confident in who they were and what needed to be done. I wish Elizabeth's  character had been  more assertive.
B0091REZMW|3.0|It is a very addictive game. Good for passing your time. There are few places where I feel lost but then it's . Not a bad bet if I need to passing time.
B005MLOOJA|5.0|love the show and the actors are fabulous... hats off to the writers who make them look so good in this series.
B000002GA8|5.0|I remember fondly hearing this album, yes, album as in vinyl, for the first time back in the 70's.  I remember being transfixed by a full orchestra, a chamber choir and Rick Wakeman on keyboards.  Wow.  I was hooked.  Classical music, never my big thing, took a giant leap forward.<br /><br />I searched for years to find a replacement album in the early 80s, coming across one in a cut out bin of a record store in London.  I was estatic.  Fast forward to the late 80s when compact discs had hit the market.  Voil&agrave;, Mr. Wakeman was one of favorite purchases.<br /><br />I've said many times, minds that envision music and make it happen have me awestruck.  Rick Wakeman has such a mind.  If you own no other Wakeman album, this should be the one you have.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I find this app very handy. It's a simple calculator but its great to have. I recommend this app to anyone who needs a calculator around. The best thing is its FREE so if you don't like it. Just delete it.
1451626096|5.0|Readers looking for a fat and juicy historical novel are those most likely to enjoy the latest book from Philippa Gregory titled, The White Princess. Protagonist Elizabeth of York finds her life upended after the battle of Bosworth field. Gregory develops Elizabeth and each historical character with sensitivity to historical facts, a view on speculative theories, and a lively writing style. I find that I enjoy the ways in which well-written historical fiction can help me think about historical figures in a broader way, beyond the few sound bites that I recall of their place in history. Gregory's fine writing makes me think about these characters as more complete human beings, and her development of them in all their complexity provided me with hours of reading pleasure.<br /><br />Rating: Five-star (I love it)
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Great game. It would have five stars of not for the buffering. I've had a lot of fun training and riding horses.
1781162646|5.0|I loved this and really did have a hard time putting it down!  As the story began to build, I wondered where is this going to go, and wow, when it took off it really took off!  I've always been a county fair and carny fan and I liked this look behind the scenes.  I especially liked the author's note at the end.  I kind of wish I could have read the Spanish version as well, I bet that was good!  I never thought I'd get that lump in the throat feeling from a Stephen King novel, but he sure knows how to capture all kinds of emotions.  I would love to see more like this from him!
B007VGXS8M|1.0|So I downloaded this game, it functioned fine until it stopped opening. Then I uninstall it and was abt to reinstall when I paid more attention to the reviews. Please fix this, I really love this game.
B00ECU2RGY|1.0|This movie had a lot of promise but ultimately the script was a muddle mess. A real waste of $5.99 to rent this one.
B0033TJATW|5.0|I love it it is a great movie and I am glad I was able to get my daughter to see and enjoy the film as well
B002W7J3SO|5.0|One of the best movies of all time that has withstood the test of time.  Cary Grant was a movie star in the grand tradition of class, style, and panache.
B009AY04A8|3.0|I really love this game but there is way to much talking and not brought game ply maybe if the talking was a little less then I would read it but I just skip all the dialect
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|After seeing the movie again for the third time it was still a great action movie with all the thrills you want in a good action movie.  The good guys came out on top winning for the Nation.
1451662432|5.0|It's great to read how determination, hard work and power of the mind can get you places! I would say that he has an unbelievably true life story!!
B005544TRQ|5.0|It's very interesting with a plot line that is paralleled with other shows.  The lead role actors were well chosen and carry their parts flawlessly.
B009LMTDL0|4.0|As other readers commented, this book is wonderful for women with young families trying to juggle family life and working.  However, it is an interesting sociological commentary about women and their role in the workplace.  Interesting and worthwhile without a lot of investment in time...
B005GIS2UQ|5.0|My expectations were low for this but now it is a favorite that I share will all new visitors who are looking for a laugh and entertainment. Great job. Franco does deserve a roast. Another funny funny movie.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|This series is captivating and truly enjoyable. The characters and story lines draw the viewer in and keep them engaged.
B00DHKKN6Q|1.0|Installed this game and the moment I opened it to play, Lookout flagged it as adware and recommend uninstall.  Be careful if you decide to download this one.
B00C7JGDBW|4.0|We have no doubt that this will be a cult classic someday just like the 1939 movie we all know and love.  Well written, acted, scored and the special effects are very believable.  A movie for all generations.
B009AY04A8|3.0|I'm glad I picked this game up as the FAOTD. It's for the most part what you would expect from your standard hidden object adventure game but with some serious flaws.<br /><br />First of, dialogue! There's so much unnecessary talking. I find myself tapping the screen frantically just to get through the annoying cut scenes.<br /><br />Then there's the tap sensitivity. It's too touchy when you're trying to zoom or scroll (always counts as a tap) and yet you can tap on the edge of an object and it will reject it. Very frustrating.<br /><br />Also, when playing scenes where you're being shown a list or shadows of objects the list covers a good part of the left side of the screen with no way to minimize it.<br /><br />I'll likely keep the game but I'm glad I didn't put any money into it.<br /><br />PS The game is also very demanding of a review and you can't turn off the pop up for it
B002JXK5VU|5.0|Love the idea of lots of scientists living near each other and interacting. Reminds me of the Big Bang Theory with adults and families.
B00AW57L96|3.0|Easy read but still has a storyline. Pretty good really. Could have been longer. Really liked how the four lives came together in the end
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This is a lovely puzzle game with thoughtful twists. The navigation was quick to pick up and the play was excellent.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Very fun. Addictive and keeps you coming back. No need to purchase anything you don't want to.  The accents are sometimes a little dingy but you can live with them.  I recommend this one for anyone!
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Close to Atari original. Not the same sound or graphics but same game premise. Fun. Addicting. Got it for free. Not sure if I would pay for the app.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Loved this season, as well as the first two seasons. I can't wait til season 4 airs, hopefully early 2014.
B0029LCJJS|5.0|We love history based tv and especially when it is done in a fictional drama.  We have just started on Season 2.
B008SVS3FC|4.0|I really enjoy John Hiatt's musical style and his band is terrific! I found the cover off-putting and didn't understand the significance of it!
B009GEEMLY|5.0|Great mic of characters and personalities. This is one of the best Marvel movies ever made.If you haven't seen it yet, make a point to watch and enjoy!
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|Love this game so fun<br />Me and my boyfriend play this everyday<br />My family has played this game and don't really like it.
0385523394|2.0|SPOILERS KIND OF: Just got this book having watched the series (DOES NOT EVEN MEASURE UP TO THE SERIES).  Very interesting memoir about a little yuppy Smithy girl who got caught up in her trendy lesbian romance to a drug smuggler and ended up in prison because (SURPRISE!)the girlfriend turned her in-how she deals with lock up and its characters and her romances and relationships on the outside.  I really didnt want to like Piper (and DONT), but you will find yourself warming up to some of the prisoners she meets at the (so called) Danbury Federal Country Club prison which seems anything but.  She is smug and her constant insisting that \\"I am not a racist\\" gets old-I highly doubt she was that popular in prison because she comes off as a bit of a snot in the book, perhaps she is delusional or was snorting some of the heroin she was smuggling.  She just did an NPR interview and I liked her during the interview, different Piper than the one who wrote the book it seemed.<br /><br />And PLEASE,she knew exactly what she was doing and probably did more than what she was caught for.  Here is my take on Piper:  Trendy Lesbian, spoiled brat, entitled, narcissistic.  If I were her \\"bunkie\\" she would have gotten the shank the first night she tried to prove how \\"down\\" she was by name dropping hip hop artists.  You will never stop hearing how pretty, blond and \\"SMITHY\\" she is, NEVER.<br /><br />Let this book be a lesson to the blond, middle class white girls of the world, anyone can end up behind bars, you are just like those people you turn your noses up at if you commit a crime.  Also suggest reading Wally Lamb's collection of female prisoner memoirs after you read this, \\"Couldn't Keep It To Myself\\" for another voice that isnt someone who had choices like Piper.<br /><br />If you watch the Netflix show, you will be disapointed.  The characters on the show have more debth, even as you don't know their full story-I love how they tease you with little vinettes about how they got into jail or about their backgrounds.  I think that was what bothered me the most, the unfairness, that Piper, this educated Smithy, can write such a book, but the women she is writing about will never write such a book, probably did not have her support in prison or out, and most of them arent living high on the hog now as Piper most likely is.<br /><br />All in all, this book was okay, it's an entertaining read, not the best written, but still a good summer book.
B007V65R54|4.0|I wasn't sure about a book on statistics but Nate Silver can write and make dry topics relevant and worth reading. Since American Democracy is founded on an informed electorate, please read this book before the next election.
B005VPRET4|5.0|Great little play set for the age range.  Granddaughter had fun assembling and the playtime was nice with the little scenarios she imagined.
0131479415|5.0|This book is a classic. It came out in 2006, but is still fully relevant. Highly recommended to all Agile practitioners, beginners or savvy; it has something for us all.
B00A285OOW|5.0|It is wonderful to be transformed back in history to a time and place we might have forgotten about.  Even though this novel is fiction, it is a great read if you love history and romance.
B00A8ECU24|1.0|My daughter and I played this app frequently. We'd made it to level 65, had over 100K in bits, 18 gems and were on our way to completely clear Canterlot (Ponyville is bigger and costs more). We had almost all of the ponies you can purchase for bits and only a couple of the ones bought with gems. I refuse to let my girl link this game with my Facebook account and I won't create an account for either of us on Gameloft so the ponies bought with hearts are unattainable. When we did buy gems, I used a couple gift cards I'd gotten through Swagbucks, so I wasn't too miffed when the game auto updated and immediately crashed a couple days ago. Before this, however, multiple errors started showing up in the game:<br /><br />After collecting bits from the shops and shutting the game down, bits were reset to previous levels before the collection<br /><br />If you started to clear debris (rock, tree) and also started building a pony's house or shop then shut down the game, you had to do it all over again when you logged back in.<br /><br />If you try clearing more than one piece of debris at a time and shut down the game, only one gets cleared; the others reset and you have to do it all over again.<br /><br />Gems weren't added to the count after collecting them<br /><br />Sales were ridiculously short, sometimes only an hour or two<br /><br />Despite all this we still tried to enjoy the game as much as we could. Now, we can't. STRING NOT FOUND keeps popping up. Game won't boot up properly. I guess we'll have to find something else to bond over.
0786856297|5.0|I love the whole series, I enjoyed the simple writen by author and it is a very refreshing story. Brought my love for the Greek miths back
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|One of the best Sifi movies I've seen in a long time. Music was also excellent.  Tom Cruise was at his best.
1423101464|5.0|I love the whole series, I enjoyed the simple writen by author and it is a very refreshing story. Brought my love for the Greek miths back
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I really enjoyed this final book in the trilogy series. It had nice plot twists that kept me very entertained.
B002BWP49M|3.0|Bought it because i love the books, movie is ok i did not lib=ke the actors and how they act but overall it is ok.
B006BAEQB2|5.0|Excellent book! Plan on reading the others. Great use of historical facts to weave a great story.  Thank you Philipppa Gregory.
B005UT29Z0|3.0|Unless they are really well-made, most financial movies are probably pretty boring to the average person.  This movie is no different.  It's a great cast and no one is particularly horrible but the story just isn't very interesting.  For anyone who knows the financial industry, the plot is not particularly believeable.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I am really into this show.  It keeps you interested all the time.  I like the many different sub plots going on.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|My dog chewed my cable in half while on a family vacation. There was one waiting at home thanks to Amazon.
0399226907|5.0|I just HAD to have this book. My parents read it to me when I was a kid, and I really wanted to read it to my girl. The price here on amazon is great! The book sells for $14 at chapters.
1451626096|4.0|Very good way of keeping up with the history and stories behind the White Queen's daughter and the Lady of the Rivers' granddaughter. The book is filled with descriptions of how her married life to Henry VII probably was. Lots of drama, action, intrigue, a mother in law from hell and even a little romance.<br />Only as I have read all other books in the series, I found it a bit repetitive at times, most of all when the characters describe their motives for doing things and the backstories of their families. But all in all I really enjoyed it!
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|It's all in the delivery!  Tina Fey has always been one of my favorite comedians, and I'm pleased to say that it seamlessly translated through to her writing.  I mean, read through one chapter and try not to hear her narrating in you head as you go along.  Very well done!
B0081X8AE6|5.0|Wow really love this artist. I heard him play at a concert and wondered what his music was all about. Great music
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I love the idea of interacting with friends or family or just reading what is put on the wall about their lives.  I have met and became friends with a lot of people because of FB.<br />On the other hand I play games such as  Cafe world or Farmville and Zoo and end up more frustrated than not with the constant reloading or just having the screen freeze.  Most of the time I just shut them down and do E mail
B005LAII12|5.0|This movie is crazy funny. I enjoy watching this movie about a talking teddy bear. I hope they come up with a part II or something.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|I really enjoyed watching this series!  It takes me back to simpler times where ones town was ones world.  The relationships between characters were enjoyable.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|I hate the way it is viewed on my Kindle.  It is difficult to use.  It is NOT user friendly at all.  I would NEVER recommend this to anyone.
B000NDIAWY|5.0|ALL of Brandi Carlile's cds are great. Go see her in concert too!  She and her band are so talented and you can tell they truly like playing music together.
0385523394|4.0|The story is very compelling, in fact, far more compelling than the over the top treatment it got on the Netflix series, and the first paragraph is an attention grabber.
034544678X|4.0|Fine handbook on how to treat dogs. Lots of information, but I would not recommend it as a first book for new dog owners. Too much information, too many stories. I prefer LOVE HAS NO AGE LIMIT: WELCOMING AN ADOPTED DOG INTO YOUR HOME as the first book and this book as a second or later source of information.
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|Surprisingly enjoyable! It had funny moments, along with a good romantic story. If only zombies could be this way.  Definitely worth watching!
B00E5Q1HJS|5.0|I like the new cast and the prequel stories. The HD video from Amazon works well, be sure to click the HD copy even if your unsure if your speed qualifies as the system will stream HD when you have enough bandwidth and lessen the quality on the fly when you do not. The SD version is just ok and does not give justice to this movie.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Hard to put down with an elegant twist in the end. It includes a heart wrenching story and a military strategic novel in one.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|After seeing the movie that just came out, I discovered that it was based on this series. I loved the movie and was interested in finding out more about the story. I bought it for my kindle and was pleased to discover that the book is ten times better than the movie. It was extremely difficult to put down, I was finished with it in about a day and a half. The author created an entire world within our own and I found it to be fascinating and creative. I've already purchased the next installment in the series and can not wait to dive into it!
B0083Z614S|3.0|I am still reading the book as life has gotten I the way of my reading on a regular basis.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I have always played solitaire (with a deck of cards) for as long as I can remember.  Now I can play it where ever I want....a great relaxing game and a good way to occupy &quot; waiting time&quot;.  Recommend it to all age groups and its free.
B002FQOI0A|5.0|Liked this book I would recommend to get this book its really good!!! really Good for school reading too. Good book.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This was a great season, someone in the immediate family died, two babies were born  baby and the ending is a real cliffhanger.  I couldn't believe what happened.  If you haven't watched it yet, you have to see it asap.  You won't believe what happened in the final scenes of the last show of the season.  I can't wait for season 4, I know it will be great.
B005H9B44A|4.0|Another good D/C Comic character brought to the big screen. Action packed with a good story-line, it is a must if you plan on watching the Avengers.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Strong and really well made. Nice number of pockets. Strong zippers. Would buy again. Fits a fair amount of equipment.
B00BV1OT0O|5.0|Mi girlfriend is a huge fan of minions so I gave her this one and she absolutely loves it. It does not look cheap or fake at all...it is pretty sturdy. The minions are &#34;sooooo cute&#34;.
B00304RMFE|5.0|Halo Legends: There is so much ACTION/ADVENTURE here in the movie that might urge you to watch the movie REPEATEDLY!!!!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I read this book in 3 days. It kept me guessing and was not predictable at all. I love the suspense. I never saw the ending coming! Great book!
B009B8YZKS|3.0|I love the video game: Halo 4!! But this movie does NOT have enough ACTION/ADVENTURE scenes!!! Like I said &#34;headline&#34; Only for Halo fans!!!
B001NLCBJI|5.0|Not usual Hollywood-style movie.  And I love the way how it introduced Japanese culture (my husband and I have visited Japan for a few times and that's how exactly we feel about this country).  Love it!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This is a fun game and it is also free so it was a good addition to my kindle fire hd
B00AEFXE9U|5.0|I love this movie.  It is one of my favorites of all time.  Must see.  I could watch it over and over.
B00DYOOGYK|5.0|I bought gangstar  Rio and it was great but this game is the best game I have ever played on the kindle fire. P.S BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0042TV4IW|5.0|No sex, violence, or language necessary.  Here we are treated to uplifting, life-affirming stories about wonderfully true-to-life characters.  THis is what television (and movies) should aspire to.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is by far my new favorite program! I have been hooked since the opening scene of seson one, and look forward to tons of great stuff to come!
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|I wanted to know more about the other planet; what they used; what did they do with the humans?  Maybe I missed something...
B000G6R7B8|4.0|Bought this for him and he says he likes it.  Very low price for an automatic watch.  Attractive too.  Recommended
1451695195|3.0|This story is about an illness. Somewhat interesting, but there is only one indication of proof of heaven.That is when he sees a picture of a sister he did not know he had and realized that it was her who had been showing him around heaven while he was in his dream world during his sickness.
B00EE3FVSU|4.0|Haven't finished the whole season yet. Only first few episodes.<br /><br />A little soap-operish as everyone in the small village seems to have something to hide.<br /><br />The accents take some getting used to, and the closed caption when I watched seemed to be a scene behind.<br /><br />Very high quality production. Good to excellent performances at all levels.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I read read this book because I had read the first one.<br />I was disappointed with this book because it didn't really go anywhere.<br />The entire book is about sex sex & more ways to have mm sex!<br />Enough already I love the characters but the book needed more substance.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This is a perfect book to teach compassion and courage to both children and adults.  The students, teachers and parents were perfectly represented!
B002WJI63A|4.0|When my 4 and 6 year old saw this out of the box, their first comment was that it was small. After playing with it for a while, my 4 year old got hives. My wife is certain that it was because of the doll so we had to take it away. The hives got a little better with meds and we gave him back the doll for bedtime and the hives acted up again.
B00CSYRHG6|4.0|This movie is a great watch.  If you're getting this, thinking it would be like the other Studio Ghibli movie, you're wrong.  There's no fantasy involved at all.  HOWEVER, it is a GREAT SLICE OF LIFE movie that takes place in the 1960s in Japan.  It follows high school student Umi and her daily activities.  One day, she finds out that she is the center of a poem.  The poem describes her daily routine of raising a set of signal flags with the message \\"I pray for safe voyages\\".  And that's where our slice of life adventure takes off.<br /><br />The movie itself is very enjoyable, and you'll find the conflicts engaging.  The movie's pacing is nicely done.  So, please give this movie a chance.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Not a bad game for free I guess.  This would be a good game for young as well as older players.
B0016492BW|4.0|I really, really love this movie. If it were possible to give it 4.5 (or even 4.9) stars I would.<br />My only issue with the DVD is while the movie itself has English subtitles, the bonus features only have subtitles in Chinese, Japanese, and Portuguese.<br />But other than that, this is an excellent DVD loaded with special features and silly bits.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Mind boggling!Was propelled to not put it down.Sometimes the teacher becomes the learner..always continue to make each experience life  altering.
B008Y1YK0I|5.0|One of the best films ever. I rank it right with his &#34;The Bridge on the River Kwai.&#34; Both films are magnificent on Blu-ray.
B0083Z614S|5.0|I like the philosophy of &#34;Getting up and doing something!&#34;.  Here we have two young individuals that thought that they had so little, but each found that they had something for the other.
B001B51B9M|5.0|I loved this picture and rate it as the best non-Rodgers & Hammertein II musical. Taking place in a fictional midwest town hit the mark for a Minnesotan like me.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|This alarm clock is so helpful. I need it because I get up pretty late so I need a alarm clock instead of buying one which is very expensive.<br />Week don't just stand there upload it!!!
B00CE3IC74|4.0|These things are good for what they are. But they have way to little writable memory for the extra cost of these over the older versions that don't work with the S4. I went to create a contact card on the keychain fob and all it would let me put in is the name and phone number. I would add in my email address and it would say the tag was too small. Plus, when I bought mine they were two dollar more expensive for the 10. Overall, I would recommend for task launching, but if you want to write much data to it at all, you won't be able to. You have to keep in mind how small \\"150 bytes\\" really is. I mean our computers have giga or tera bytes. That is that is 1 billion and 1 trillion bytes respectively. Just remember that when you go to buy these. And these are the only types, if I'm not mistaken, that work with the S4.
B0049J2CKE|4.0|Very cute movie, fine for mature young ones, and then all ages.  Cute jokes written on two levels, adults, and children, so enjoyable for both.
B000002GK1|5.0|This album is amazing to say the least. It contains so many moods from from up-beat to dark and decaying. Be sure to listen to it all together each track in order to get a full effect. I'm not going to say this one is the best Garden album because they are all great. Every single album of Soundgarden's is good, so go out and get them all, you'll love them. And remember, listen to the WHOLE thing, there cd's are are full of rare gems!
0345803485|1.0|downloaded a kindle sample of this book(which already deleted) and a mandarin version paperback book to see how the translation goes... turns out the translation is bad, the story is full of rubbish! i'm gonna sell it to secondhand book store as soon as i have free time, or give it to someone i really hate!
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|Love the layout, scoring system prizes. Interactive and fun to play<br />. I played uno before and its nothing compared to this version. Your games can be saved to play on another device so this way you don't lose your progress... that's important to me. My 7 year old also plays. The play with Facebook friends feature is also good. My only downfall is if you run out of tokens to play and are impatient to wait for new ones then you have to pay.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Like the fact that it has different levels which makes it a long game. And fun to play. WISH IT WAS ALL FREE THOUGH
B00001QEE8|5.0|A must see. Phil Harris, Sebastian Cabot, Louis Prima, Bruce Reitherman, George Sanders, J. Pat O'Malley, and Sterling Holloway are a perfect fit for their Disney characters. This is a wonderful adaptation of Rudyard Kipling's stories about Mowgli, the Jungle Boy.<br />Watch it, sing along, dance along and share it with the grandchildren.
B006LR0XLM|5.0|Dropbox let me in the cloud before the cloud was popular.  I am a part time professor and I park my notes on dropbox and can work on them from wherever and on whatever devise is handy.<br /><br />It also allowed me to send (ok, park a file in dropbox) that  was too big for the email system for my recipient.  Dropbox is great.
1609611543|5.0|It's no wonder Wheat Belly made #1 on the NY Times bestseller list. Well researched and documented studies should convince the greatest of skeptics to see merit in this book.  Dr. Davis' patient stories are further evidence that eating wheat-free might be worth the effort.  Give it a try for 3 weeks as he often suggests to his patients.  What do you have to lose?!  I decided to do just that and, while I don't need to lose weight, found I quickly lost inches in the midsection.  More importantly to me, I feel better.  Most of the aches and pains of osteoarthritis are gone.  Like many other reviewers, I don't have as great a need to snack.  Not eating my \\"go to\\" wheat snacks I've learning to be more thoughtful about what I eat between meals.<br /><br />I found Dr. Davis' explanation about what has happened to wheat since the 1950s interesting reading too.  To think what geneticists have done by developing new strains of wheat is alarming. Now I read and research on line articles about how so many of our foods come from GMO grown seeds.  I am more carefully reading labels and buying more organic foods plus making more from scratch as did everyone before all the canned and processed foods beginning in the middle of the 20th century.  I'd been interested the alkaline-acidic balance for some time.  Dr. Davis explains in his book how alkaline our diets are if we eat wheat plus meat and dairy and how bad this is for our health.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|I love this charger case, it works great! Not only does it charge my headset conviently, it also protects it.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Book was very entertaining.  Could not put it down and finished I it in less then two days. Have recommended it to others.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I love how this app syncs to all my computers and devices to make sharing the info easy and seamless.
1401324649|2.0|When I first saw the title, I thought it might be humorous.  I read the reviews and thought I'd give it a try.  I downloaded it on my Kindle, read the sample and thought I have to read more.  Big mistake.<br /><br />The sample was the best portion of the book.  Shortly after the sample is when the story line starts falling apart.  Every other chapter is related to his early life as an explosives expert chatting away with VP Harry Truman.  What???? Then the next chapter resumes his present life.<br /><br />The whole story is bizarre, but not in a funny way.  Too many characters are introduced who really have nothing to do with the story. I am 1/4 of the way through and find myself skipping to any funny moments.<br /><br />Silly, funny yes...in the sample only.  Don't waste your money!
B00DGNOMB6|5.0|Not a mainstream kind of movie but it was very well done. Great story. Maggie Smith is fabulous as always.
B00D6GT5S8|3.0|An interesting , very different sound from anything mainstream. Problem is that the all of the songs sound very similar. Waiting for the disc to be over before I got to the end... a bad sign.
B004SUWR2C|3.0|I loved this game until the recent update. Now the cards are much smaller and harder to see. Easier to miss what is happening on the board. Graphics seem to be a little better, but I would rather have the old version back. Other than that I had been enjoying this app for almost a year now. Very addictive, and like others have said, a nice way to pass the time.
1781162646|5.0|This book was a pleasure to read. Not available in ebook format. It is a quick and fun read. A little bit of mystery, romance, and creepiness. Captures the feel of the &#34;carnival&#34;.
B005LAIIQC|5.0|We thoroughly enjoyed this movie and the connection it made to the Bourne series.  Wondering if they will continue with another and how they will make it interesting and relevant to the others.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Didn't think I would like this book, but after several friends all seemed to like it, I decided to read it. Much better than I expected with a great twist at the end that I did not see coming.
B000JVSUS4|5.0|The re-creation of Pearl Harbor and the air combat missions were intense.  This movie puts you back at the time in the middle of it all.  Brings to light the unsung heroes who risked all for our country.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is not your regular, run of the mill zombie series. Neither is it a post apocalyptic &#34;what are we gonna do now?&#34;<br />This series is a well thought out, strongly written, and well acted punch in the gut look at what could well be our bio hazard future.<br />If you like unpredictability that has you thinking a beat ahead of the action, just to be blown away by how wrong you were, this is for you.<br />No one is safe. Anybody could die. Anybody could come back.<br />ANYBODY!!!<br />Enjoy...........but keep a light on!<br /><br />C F Wagener
B0038M2AZA|5.0|Claire Daines does a fantastic job of representing Temple Grandin.  A real inspiring story of someone who knows the obstacles in their life, used them to their advantage and continues to make a real contribution to others and society.
B00BZW5W3W|5.0|Maysa has a very sultry and powerful voice.  I admire her soulful sound.  Enjoyed the CD.  Can't wait for more music from Maysa.
B0021L8V0M|5.0|A very different movie plot and interesting lead character.  Would recommend this to anyone who enjoys action movies and Angelina.
B00A9ET4MC|5.0|love the point of view of the story. The ending I felt was a bit weak and predictable.  Overall, a very good read.
B008LV8TSU|4.0|After seeing the movie I really didn't think the book was going to be much different, however, the book was better in some ways, since it described a more imaginative world(s) than just one place. I would liked to have read the book fIrst tho, since the movie kept trying to replace what I  seen as I read. All in all, the book gave a better understanding of the characters and plots as the author wrote them and not as the movie portrayed them.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I did like the way the author wove the story around the characters. The Epilogue is a great addition to the narrative
B00A2FHZVU|4.0|After a somewhat slow beginning, was shocked out of my complacency by the drama that enfolded, became intrigued with the complicated relationships then became fascinated by the switching back from the then to now and back again throughout the movie.  The characters were rich, complicated, with hints of there being more than first meets the eye.  Feel all the better for having watched this movie because of the other stories it told as well.  Stories about women, ageing, caring for someone other than yourself, giving of yourself, male/female relationships, racial tensions, story telling at its best.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love the show so much, I bought the xbox game.  The game is so good that I'm screaming every time I have to go in a building for &#34;supplies.&#34;  Very similar to the show.  I love how the show examines relationship between people, importance of family and survival.  Its not just about zombies, but about being human.  What would you do in a case like that kind of questions.  I'm excited to see the last episode today on season 3, cant wait for season 4...I'm seriously considering subscribing to cable so I can see the new season starting in October.<br /><br />Great show!
B004F4HWNU|4.0|Unfortunately, I have yet to view it as our Australian region DVD is different to the US DVD region you sent me so at this moment am very disappointed as it sounds to be a very good movie.  Yes, we have Blu-ray.  You sent Blu-ray as i requested, but please may I send it back if you are please able to replace it with our Australian region.  This is the first time this has happened after all the products I have ordered from Amazon over the years.
B009LYQE2E|5.0|Figuarts Zero never disappoints when it comes to quality and detail. This certain figurine does not come with any extra props but your not going to need it when Luffy is looking this bad ass.
B00AAQVSDW|5.0|Country is almost sounding like rock and roll and rap. This album combines both styles and still stays true to its country music genre. Really good album!
B00CW7KK9K|5.0|This product is a very nice gadget that keeps me active and in motivation to exercise or sleep in best ways.<br /><br />Look forward to se new products. I got the weight.....<br /><br />Lars
B001O1O71C|5.0|I saw the movie and I like how this book has more detail than the movie both were great experiences
B000OVLINI|5.0|One of the best books I've read in ages.  It's exciting PLUS it's written so well.  The descriptions are incredible....made me laugh,<br />made me sit back and ponder, made me sad.  I was thrilled to find out that this is the first of a series.  I can't wait to read #2.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Both my husband and I have thoroughly enjoyed all three seasons of Downton Abbey.  It's some of the best tv we've seen in years.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Awesome game! Lots of fun no matter what age, my 5 year old nephew loves playing this! Love the characters too!
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|Who knew cold could be so hot?  There were times when I feared my Kindle would catch on fire. And besides the love story--which was amazing--Nalini continued the saga of her psy/changeling world with her usual attention to detail. Suspense...action...intrigue...it has it all.<br /><br />I enjoyed Heart of Obsidian so much that it inspired me to start from the first novel and read through the entire series again. I'm paying closer attention to the hints Ms. Singh drops all along, thoroughly amazed by her craftsmanship. I cannot recommend this series enough. If you don't like it, there is seriously something wrong with you. (Either that or perhaps you are Psy?)
0070511136|2.0|Not happy i got a used book when I paid extra for a new one. The condition of the book is good enough, but several pages have writing in them.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|The minions are incredible. The game works very good, it may have some minor glitches, but it works like a charm.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved the fifty shades trilogy. Can't wait for more. I couldn't put it down...Loving me some Christian Grey. Speechless
B005UT29Z0|3.0|theme was sad but true that company was under water big time. Was watchin wall street at time of crisis  and can relate to peoples' dilema when all this went down
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I'm a big fan of these type games. I play on it way too long but enjoy it very much. The tiles are harder to do than my barnyard one but love the challenge anyway.
B00AJER3SE|4.0|This Blu-ray is the new remaster of The Terminator.  It's worth the upgrade for the picture quality alone--but I'm not getting rid of my older Blu-ray for two reasons:  One-the older Blu-ray is grainier and rougher looking (exactly the way the film looked in the cinema in 1984) and Two-the new remaster does NOT have the original mono mix.  I'm normally not so picky about audio mixes but the original mono mix is the only version where the metallic scraping can be heard in the music.  All remastered audio versions of this movie's soundtrack have mixed the scraping out.  The original mono should ALWAYS be offered!  But the picture quality on this new disc is to DIE for!  Sweet!!!!
1616550414|5.0|An excellent item that makes a complete view of zelda lore... with minor mistakes made by the editors, but its a &#34;genuine&#34; and &#34;original&#34; article...
B005JABSB6|3.0|Have only used them once or twice and not for long so I'm not very qualified, if at all, to comment. I don't really cae for the current 3D broadcasts so try them in a store first. I did not.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Easy to download on Kindle Fire HD.  I would recommend this game to download and have fun playing. Would buy again.
B005DF2QMC|1.0|I bought this item thinking it would be a great way to convert some very special audio books I have for listening on the ipod. well the playback was like listening to a drunk person after it recorded to the computer. I know the cassettes play fine, because I can play them in a stereo player and listen to the clearly. Do not buy this product. You will regret it. I know I did.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Easy to download. Can view the weather on my Kindle. Also can view weather in other locations. I recommend to purchase.
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|I have been waiting to see this movie and finally did. Everyone did a great job. It was so much fun!
B00CATSONE|4.0|This book is full of interesting quotes and facts about a highly underated Telsa and Thomas Edison, along with the political antics of the 1900's. Exceptional read and great, sound advice.
B002ZG974M|5.0|SOOO interesting to compare, in a very simple way with a camera and hardly any dialogue, the first year in the lives of 4 or 5 children's first year of life from very different cultures around the world.  A must-see for all new parents -- and this grandmother enjoyed it cause who isn't fascinated by and doesn't love to watch babies?!!
B005LAII4E|2.0|I don't want to spoil the plot but it doesn't live up to the prior GI Joe movie. I was excited when I saw the list of who was included. It turned out to be a waste of their talent and my money. This was the first time I pre-ordered something I didn't see and I was burnt.
B00C2C637I|5.0|Classic, intriguing, something I believe I read many years ago as a youngster and pretty much forgot over the years until I picked it up again. Glad I did. Now I may have to dredge up the movie I never watched. Then again, after having read the book, maybe that is not such a good idea.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|Cannot wait for next season!!!  Loved the English version on Kindle FIre!!!  Hated to see the way Matthew exited the show
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Entertaining and can be challenging to keep up with several bingo cards.  I especially like the daily free tournament  where you can win coins to play with and power booster!
140006922X|5.0|I'll have to buy some more &#34;Aslan&#34; now.  Very easy and fluent writing style, I could totally picture the days in Jerusalem when Jesus walked the holy land.  A must read.
B005XQLBU4|3.0|Fun for when your bored not worth 99&cent; though it also has upgrades I like games with upgrades in them
B006M7JCC2|4.0|I sense the genuineness of the author, and although what she wrote might not be \\"provable\\" to some, nonetheless resonated as truths to me.  I can't explain how it is that what she says are some things I had suspected or had \\"known\\" for a long time.  These confirmations or affirmations are Eureka for me and I am grateful to Anita for sharing her experiences and wisdom. I had wished there were an existential question answered, but my research continues.  Hence, 4 stars, BUT well worth it any case.
1616550414|5.0|A great purchase for any Zelda Fan. Good sized book with lots of info and concept art. Definitely a must have!
B00EDF43MY|5.0|As a big sis of a 4 year old sister this barand of app is amazing if you like to know make one about a shelter to run. Please get this app
B005LAII1C|5.0|If you like Family Guy, American Dad, Cleveland Show, And Most things on Adult Swim. You'll like this movie. A re-imagined Teddy Ruxpin that drinks, tokes, and likes chicks.. Thunder Buddies!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is Firefly.  'Nuff said.  Seriously, if you don't know why there's such a cult following of this show, you probably need to buy this and find out.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Thisvis an Awesome fun game. No blood involved. Its hard to find a decent fun game that doesnt involve gore. This one is perfect.
B00CZAYNOC|4.0|Like I said since this is a double album Im trying to be fair. If this was all they were bringing to the table for a new album I would be upset. I have listened to it about 15 times so I feel comfortable about saying this. It is a good album, not as good as the last records but, thats probably because it is a double album. They had to spread out the good songs with some that would not have made it to a single release. There are a bunch of songs on here that are top notch though I must say. Five Finger are in my top five bands along with Trivium,A7X,10 years,Metallica. So I hold these guys to a high standard. I have been nervous with a lot of my favorite bands releasing new material this year because you never want to see a band flop. Honestly I think its all Bullet4MyValentines fault, they flopped so bad on there latest album that its got me nervous. Not to mention the last albums by all these bands were so good, I just cant imagine them topping there last releases! Anyways, I think between volumn 1 and 2 of 5FDP new albums we will be more than pleased.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|my grandson loves this game. He said this game is awesome ..its the best game..I like your games a lot
B003Q6D2B4|3.0|The movie arrived ahead of time. It has a lot of action but the plot was so, so.  a lot of one liners but overall a good movis, waiting for Red 2 to hit the dvd scene.
1400079179|4.0|A fun read for a novel of fiction. Written to sound true, but a good mystery with twists and turns.
B00B2DSIAI|5.0|This movie is for both parents and children alike. Great animation, plot. It is funny, sad, and enjoyable. A nice way to spend a family movie night.
B004V6BQ3O|4.0|In the first place the overnight delivery was just what I needed to use the Microphone at a wedding at very short notice.<br /><br />The microphone works well in the wedding setting. Also had good results videoing a 2 year old playing in the ocean, the breeze, sound of the waves and the little ones voice all perfectly and well balanced in the recording.<br /><br />Light and easy to transport.
B00DP3IESY|4.0|Original movie making at one of its greatest. Tom's acting is superb as usual. Can't wait for either a sequel or prequel.
0452289963|5.0|Explains clearly who and what stands in the way of your Peace of mind and spirit. Especially concerning a life heavily contaminated with anger.
B00BHMEALA|4.0|Ben Affleck did a wonderful acting in this movie. Really convinced you of his role. Same with the other cast as well. Not sure of the accuracy, but it did follow facts of what I have read. A good movie to watch from the normal that Hollywood is putting out these days.
B0073COMUW|4.0|These bulbs put off an extremely white light, not a warm white of an incandescent bulb.<br /><br />I decided to leave them in the light fixture though.  They are so bright they really help the room.  I just have to get used to the harshness and artificialness of the light.
B00BESCUKK|3.0|Great fighting scenes, decent screen writing. Original story.<br /><br />Although acting was subpar from these usually great actors. Still it is good entertainment if you have nothing else to watch.
B00ANDDBBE|5.0|As i said in my review of the third season of the new Doctor Who, I've been a fan of the show since the William Harnell days. I unfortunatley do not get BBC America on my cable service, so I have had to watch all the new episodes on D.V.D. That being said, I love the current shows(especially SCHOOL RE-UNION in the second series). Donna Nobel was one of the best companions in the new shows. She was not in love with the Doctor, and just wanted to be friends. I also loved the way she didn't hesitate to argue and sass him. Of all the doctors that I've seen, I think it's a tie between David Tennant and Tom Baker as my favorite Doctor! The only Doctor I really never cared for was the seventh. Somehow, I just never warmed up to Sylvester McCoy's version or everybodys favorite Gallifreyan.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|I love this game because all of the guns are cool and you also actually have to load them and make sure that the safety is off so you  can fire the gun.THIS Game IS AWESOME.
B007Q0K9TE|3.0|I bought it for a gift and so I have not heard it yet. But everything Andre Rieu does is great.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Love the game.very addictive but too many changes too soon. Lower the maximum amount to play. Entertaining,however multiple changes can cause you too lose Players.<br /><br />Meridiangirl77@aol
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|This device DOES work but there are a few drawbacks. First off, it ONLY works on 2.4Ghz wireless networks which removes a lot of wireless N networks from the picture.  Secondly, Google is actively blocking local content streaming which takes away a lot of it's value.<br /><br />This is nothing more than a roku and not really worth it to be honest.  I personally don't like it because I cannot use it at work which is a wireless N network.
B00DEG4Z1W|5.0|My child loves the accessories!! It keeps her innovative and creative; and at the same time excited to show off the new look.
B00B9366VO|5.0|What a wonderful look at the history of recording with some of the names never to be forgotten.  I will not do a spoiler but the ending is fabulous.
044024613X|5.0|Landy is one of the new kids on the block when it comes to authors in this genre.  He will do will based on this book alone.
B004FS1TLM|5.0|I loved it. There is absolutely nothing wrong with this CD. I'm now a fan of Michael Buble.  I just wish there were more songs.
B002YCVWXQ|5.0|Great movie!  Wanted to see it in the theatre, but didn't get the chance.  Expected the ending, but still was good.
B005VT42BS|5.0|Recently tried to determine what a bunch of mystery devices were in our network. This tool listed them all and allowed me to document all of our devices including printers, access points, switches, routers, pcs, etc.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|This was perfect for a rainy day on vacation.My son was occupied for hours.It's now one of his prized possessions.
B008602KQI|4.0|Great acting by Jennifer Lawrence, but it's hard to watch a movie where kids are getting killed.  Overall, a good movie.
B00BUCW54Q|2.0|Huh? Tom and the female lead spend a lot of time talking (strategizing) with bits of action in between. I found it pretty boring overall.
B00ECUARO8|4.0|I had yet to write a review for the dozen or so movies I've watched recently but I simply could not pass this one up. Great story, great characters, great acting, and great direction. How did I miss this one before? Well worth a watch.
B0001I561E|5.0|I've loved this movie since I was a little kid, and I still love it now. That's why I decided to purchase it, and for a great price!
B008XG1X18|5.0|Like to browse thru it  and get some good ideas, entertaining suggestions,recipes, gift ideas or profound thoughts.  Better than a magazine!
B00124PXW8|5.0|I have always loved this movie. I have watched it so many times throughout the years and it still scares me.
B008JFUPK8|5.0|I don't know what the critics were complaining about, this is a top notch superhero film. After hearing some reviews I felt weary but after watching it, I became confused, I still don't quite grasp it. Henry cavil as supes was great and so were the rest of the cast. Can't wait for the sequel with Batman and the future justice league! Just mad they're waiting so long to release it in blu ray and dvd....Cmon November!!!!
B002JVWRAO|5.0|A great addition to the fan's collection this season delivers amazing action just as all of them do. Nice way to rewatch your favorite show time and time again!
B0081JPTCQ|1.0|On August 26th, Amazon listed this item as there Free App for the Day .. I purchased this item, received a receipt from Amazon and installed it on my phone .. Today, August 27th, I went to install this on my Tablet only to find out that its not in my \\"Cloud\\" listing, and when I search it, states I have to pay $3.99 !!!!! Someone needs to fix this.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|Love this show and was excited to get my copy of this season! Great way to watch your favorite blood suckers time and time again for years to come. Price was very afforadable as well!
B0089EHWQE|4.0|Me before you was an excellent book but very sad.  This book will  give your life a better meaning. Definitely worth reading!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Nothing like modern England, so don't go getting funny ideas Americans!<br /><br />But a good soap/saga.  Looking forward to Season 4.
B0036G1T78|4.0|Just a well made movie, especially being that I am not a movie aficinado...compared to some of the crap movies that have been made over the last 20 years. Just a good plot, not to many explosions, or car crashes....
B004ZRV3AU|4.0|WORKS GOOD, GOOD PRICE, DOES WHAT IT IS SUPPOSE TO DO! NICE TO FIND A GOOD PRODUCT A A REASONABLE PRICE
1401938906|5.0|Well written and very helpful in understanding the laws of the Universe, especially when using the experiments. I highly recommend it!
1451626096|4.0|I would recommend reading The White Queen before reading this book for more information on the events leading up to the reign of Henry VII (the Tudors).  While I enjoyed reading about the evolving  relationship between Henry VII and Elizabeth of York, I felt that too much emphasis was placed on the pretenders to the throne and how it affected Henry VII's treatment of the English people, foreign policies, and his family life.  The White Princess is still a book worth reading, because it describes the aftermath of the Cousin's War and sets the stage for The Constant Princess.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This gAme is the best I play it on the bus or at home but we need more updates for pocket edition like nether and doggies and shit  and forests but it's worth every penny
B0026QC0YU|3.0|It could be because it is so old, but I was not impressed at all.  Slow movie and the &#34;love&#34; interest was sad - she was pretty fugly.
B009WUBERW|5.0|Awesome movie wish more were like this..action at every turn with some of Hollywood's best stars. Definitely keeps your attention from start to finish
B006LSZECO|4.0|I bought this to read on my beach vacation. I started and finished it within 3-4 days. It was a little slow at parts but still good and worth the read. There are some nice twists.
B003VANOFY|4.0|This headset is worth every penny. The surround sound works great and the distance on the receiver is more than enough to<br />leave the computer to go cook or do anything you want within the house.<br /><br />Cons:<br />The plastic feels a little cheaper than some headphones<br />The battery can be annoying to keep charged if its not plugged in whenever not in use.<br />Sometimes the volume wheel won't work on windows 8 but works 100% on windows 7.
B00008G7UF|5.0|I have loved this movie for years. It is one my all-time favorites. I am a girl and I quote this movie. Great girls romantic comedy that even a lot of guys would be able to endure.
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|The graphics in this game are awesome. I quickly got addicted to this game so I bought the full version to continue playing. My problem is as soon as I bought it, I couldn't' her past the little girls room b/c one of the objects in the I-spy game was<br />located behind the BACK button. Therefore I can't touch it to show that I found it.  Apparently that's the object I need to continue. So now I'm stuck.
B00D9PUX5A|5.0|This may be their best album ever. It seems like a mix between their self-titled album and Last Kind Words.
B00991TCOG|2.0|The cd case was cracked and the hinges were broken off. I left the security tape on the top of the case just so the lid will stay attached when I open it. The cd works just fine, which is the only reason I didn't return the product.
0618918248|5.0|Love Richard Dawkins and all he has to offer. He is amazing. Highly recommended and I am a proud atheist!
B006LSZECO|1.0|The beginning was great. After the revaluation she was alive, it just fell apart. I couldn't believe he would put up with the situation and raise a child with her as a mother.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|I just received it,it looks very good,I will play it from tomorrow,this is a challenge for myself,you can buy it
B000AOEMXM|5.0|Great actors and actress.  Portrays compassion and humanity in contrast to other species where financial gain is reason enough or might is power.  Also fills in the gaps about the Vulcans/ Klingons/ Romulans/ the Federation of Planets etc.  Also very cutely quaint to watch early star trek technologies compared to far advanced technologies encountered in TNG and Voyager.
B0089Q1TPM|5.0|When I purchased this, I had already seen the movie and knew what I was getting there.  Getting it on Blu-ray at such a good price was a deal I couldn't pass up.  The movie is a classic and having it on Blu-ray makes it that much nicer.  I didn't really notice anything spectacular about watching the movie on Blu-ray, but I didn't notice anything particularly wrong with it on Blu-ray and as I said, the price was right.
B007AL48UK|5.0|love to play this game, is quick to play but fun and keeps my attention and is always changingto keep you on your toes
B005XQLBU4|3.0|Pretty fun little game. Nice graphics. Gets kinda hard in the higher levels. Worth spending a buck or 2 on.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|The trilogy began with mind-blowing sexcapades and by the end of the third book I was glad that it has morphed into a story -- not just smut.  One can appreciate how true fiction is once you read this trilogy.
B0081JPTCQ|5.0|Its nice to have a app I can use instead of a notebook with my scribble scratch writing. I can look back later and read it.<br /><br />Now a message for those posting privacy and it wanting permissions not listed.<br />For personal info IF YOU READ IT COMPLETELY AND NOT JUMP TO CONCLUSIONS!!!<br />IT SAYS: read bookmarks and web history and  write bookmarks and web history!!!!!<br /><br />THERE IS NO REQUEST FOR CONTACTS OR OTHER INFO
B009RX8AQW|4.0|So says Red Riding Hood, who is also a werewolf, to Dr. Whale, who is also Dr. Frankenstein. They're two residents of Storybrooke, the New England town that wasn't there before 1983, when the Evil Queen moved the whole population. Sending fairy tale characters from their enchanted world to the modern world isn't new to ABC--a short lived, broadly played sitcom called The Charmings had a similar premise. But Once Upon a Time is a sumptuous \\"theme park opera\\" in which the relationships and the relatives are as serpentine as Maleficent the dragon.<br /><br />Season Two brought the realization to the characters that they were actual fairy tale people. They didn't believe young Henry last year, but like the existence of Mr. Snuffle-Upagus, eventually you can't keep denying the truth. So now the characters have dual essences; they remember who they were and who they are. Prince Charming (or should I say \\"Cool Hand Charming?\\") takes control and sets the town straight. Snow White and Emma Swan realize they're mother and daughter, and are embarrassed about all the intimate talks they shared (apparently Snow had a one-night stand, but it was caused by a spell).<br /><br />The season also brings us the even evil-er Queen Cora, played by Barbara Hershey (who renamed herself \\"Barbara Seagull\\" in the `70s to draw attention to the plight of the species, and then changed it back). Was the name \\"Cora\\" drawn from the character Margaret \\"Wicked Witch of the West\\" Hamilton played in hundreds of Maxwell House commercials before her passing?<br /><br />The other major newcomer is the beardy, Revlon-eyed Captain Hook, played with vim and vigor (but mostly vim) by Colin O'Donoghue, who in a bonus feature seems to be shocked by the amorous attention he apparently is getting from fans. (It's not like he asked to wear the sleek leather outfit with the flowing cape and the shiny chain around his neck and the shirt open to there, ladies!) Hook is much better in the second half of the season when he settles into a supporting role. He plays well off the other actors, who have really honed their roles and created a nice chemistry. The whole season seems to really kick into gear by the midway point.<br /><br />Moving right along to biology, what's with Snow White and the Prince doin' it on camera, as their daughter and grandson enter the bedchamber? Without being a spoiler, Snow is racked with guilt about another deed, yet after being found together with nothing on but a 250-count cotton percale, they wait for their family to leave and get back to gettin' it on. Even Mom and Dad Dunphy were shocked, embarrassed and angry when their kids discovered them doing the same thing, and they're not even Disney characters.<br /><br />No matter how complex the storylines get and the double crosses get double crossed this season, the standard bearers for the series remain Lana Parilla as Regina the Evil Queen (what's really magic is how she never smears that ruby red lip gloss) and Robert \\"Full Monty\\" Carlyle as Rumpel Stiltskin (but you can call him \\"Rumpel\\").<br /><br />Like Dark Shadows, another ABC series, in which vampire Barnabas was racked with guilt about his murderous condition, yet slipped in and out of being a hero and a villain, so do Regina and Rumpel. Between that classic conflict and their acting skills, they're the ones upon which most of the rest of the show radiates. They can't turn nice, or you'd have no story. But you find yourself hoping they'll reform. And they do, then they don't, then they do.<br /><br />Season two of Once Upon a Time looks like a movie on Blu-ray. The details of the costuming and art direction show up nicely. The special effects are mostly impressive, though the seams show once in a while. But you just couldn't do a show with the illusory sets and vistas in this series back in the day, before green screens and digital effects made such things faster and more economically feasible for TV.<br /><br />And now for the bonus features(wait, let me get out my invisible chalk). This set has some of the most entertaining on any DVD set. Ariel Winter of Modern Family traces the convoluted family trees of the characters, so completely outlandish that even the cast themselves has trouble keeping it straight. Several interesting audio commentaries add to the understanding of how stories were created and how the actors approached their roles, especially after the curse ended, and they had to be two people in one. Gennifer \\"Snow\\" Goodwin explains that \\"Bobby\\" Carlyle actually changes Rumpel's behavior based on which character he encounters. Carlyle himself has assigned numbers to the levels of Rumpel's intensity. This is why I love commentaries!<br /><br />The gem of the bonus features is a spoof of Good Morning America that features funny commercials (particularly the one for Granny's Diner in which Red does her impression of SCTV's Edna Boil) and the cast gets to have fun making fun. Check out how unctuous Doctor Whale is in his segment. They're having a blast with this short video, which was played at this year's ComicCon.<br /><br />Next season promises a visit to Never Land and the appearance of Ariel. Even though the best of TV's series can ebb and flow as Once Upon a Time has this season, who couldn't resist sticking with it?(wait, let me get out my invisible chalk).

B002JODPSO|4.0|Why can't they make an unrated version of this film in Blu-ray??? The DVD unrated is OK, but I would like the better sound and video from a Blu-ray.
B001EC2ISA|5.0|Its a oldie but goodie!<br /><br />Definitely added this to my movie collection. Dvd came on time and was in GREAT condition. :)
B005PK57NU|5.0|I love it. Alicia is such a great character and the dynamic is really interesting. I love this series, and I love crime drama, though not all crime drama lovers will necessarily appreciate this series since its not focus on action or saving lives, but rather the intricacies of the legal system and the day to day drama of the legal team. Overall, worth at least a shot.
B00E8B1P9M|5.0|Very good movie I watched it with my wife and son, we loved every minute of it. I recommend this movie to all.
B00EFNXPFK|5.0|Like every song. paper doll and wildfire best. Katy perry and john mayer song is intersting. good listen and addition to mayer catalog
B003M70O5O|5.0|The story is nothing like I thought it would be. I am an old lady and thoroughly AM hooked. Want to see more.
B009JZVT70|5.0|Can't get enough of it. It is wonderful to have a show without sex, profanity and extreme violence.  I really look forward to each episode. thanks.
B009D0LBRO|1.0|I bought the thinking I was going to have a fun time, but when I hit download it says there was an error while downloading. WHAT WASTE OF MONEY! DO NOT BUY Ubisoft games on tablets or phones unless it's free.
B007XELMO4|5.0|My husband uses this camera carrier whenever we go where he is using his backpack (usually hiking). Works exactly as described. The only problem he had was his backpack did not have the dring so we simply had a dring sewn on the backpack. Works like a charm. Now he wants the traditional cotton carrier for those times he doesn't wear a backpack! Would highly recommend this to others.
B005MLOOJA|4.0|I love this show and love seeing Micheal J Fox in it. Story lines can be a little stronger but good show.
B009I2UH2W|1.0|Spent 30 dollars for this and it has lasted 5 months. It has a short in the wires that are exposed through the rubber cord and has stopped working. It sits the same place in my car so there is no reason for this. Bad product dont waste your time or money.  Very disappointed.
B00BEIYMTW|4.0|Maybe there should be a law that only children should review movies for<br />children. Asking some adult critic to get off his/her lofty perch and<br />roll around in the mud of childhood might be a bit of a stretch.<br /><br />Is \\"Planes\\" bland, derivative pablum with a \\"feel-good\\" message? Sure,<br />if you are over 30. I was lucky to see it with my 8-year-old grandson<br />and his two similarly aged friends. They loved it and talked about the<br />characters all evening.<br /><br />Being Disney, it had excellent graphics, funny sight gags and naughty<br />references that flew (literally at times) over the heads of the kiddies<br />(vasectomies figure big here). If you are an adult who loves airplanes,<br />there are cartoon versions of some real beauties especially the Gee Bee<br />Super Sportster, a barrel-shaped monster from the 1930's, and the<br />stolid F4U Corsair, modeled after WWII ace Ira Kepford's bird.<br /><br />As far as the plot; that's unimportant. It is indeed boilerplate but<br />for kids, it's the sheer thrill of watching an action-packed Saturday<br />matin&eacute;e, laps adorned with popcorn and soda containers, that matters.<br />Let the critics sip Chardonnay over their computers in disdain. The<br />kids don't care.
B003KRJNBW|4.0|Evil bad guys in a post apocalypse world?  Well no surprise there.  This movie is superbly cast and shot.  The desolation and desperation in the post apocalyptic portrayal is done well.  The scenes are not crowded with detail, it seems Kubricesque at times in it sparseness, but there is still plenty to take in in the sets and backdrops. This film is well worth seeing for its vision alone.  Denzel is aging well as an actor, and gosh I sure hope his age is augmented for the films sake because I hate to think of him getting old!  There are few surprises in the plot, as neither the theme is new, nor the way the plot unfolds; and I think we've all seen visions of the end of the world enough to get the idea.  Still, as science fiction goes, this is a pretty good movie.  I like it.  But if hope has to be peddled to the post-apocalypse masses in the form the book used, I think a good preacher would really make the difference.
B004U8VX2M|3.0|It may be difficult to rate Season 1 of &#34;Upstairs, Downstairs&#34; fairly in the aftermath of so much progress in television production since it first aired.  In one aspect of retrospect, it is almost hard to see how it was renewed for a second season.  The first season is relatively flat, has technical flaws, and only by the barest of margins does it begin to sow seeds or lay the bricks of an engrossing story line and character development to come.  If one did not know the future of this program, and thus be encouraged to continue viewing it beyond Season 1, one would probably not tune in for subsequent Seasons.  Season 1 basically boils down to the dysfunction of both the upper and lower classes of civilization.  We have the exact same dysfunction in the 21st Century.  &#34;Upstairs, Downstairs&#34; probably survived the 1970's because we had not seen anything quite like it before; it was the &#34;new kid&#34; on the block and of course coming from Britain it was thought to have a leg up on any American sense of sophisticated television.
0894803123|5.0|We bought this book along with an ice cream maker for our Kitchen Aid mixer.  We have used this book many times, and it contains 3 different bases - very rich to not as rich - for starting your homemade ice cream.  The other pages are filled with a variety of ways to add to your cream base which, by itself, is great.  You won't be disappointed.
B007FTZDN8|5.0|This is a great app to have on my Kindle- I can access the great talks on TED anytime/anywhere.The talks are not long and with such a variety of topics I always find something interesting.  I have used several in classes for my students too and they were greatly enjoyed and at the same time informative.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|It gave me absolutely no information or help. I would have been better off not downloading and spending that time continuing to play the game.
B002361MLA|5.0|I read this once several years back and thought it would be a good idea to keep in my Kindle on iPad so I can review it now and then.  Wonderful book that teaches us how to live in the present moment.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I gave in after my 4 yr old begged me to download it for her. I only let her play for a certain amount of time but she would play for hours if I allowed it. It is a little slow at loading at times but, what game isn't..
0812982622|5.0|I understand why it got the prize.  Excellent book and I was unable to put it down.  So fascinating and fairly factual it seems.  Great book.
B0032JTV6U|5.0|I plan on owning all of the seasons. I bought this and it was used, but it was in excellent shape, not a scratch on it. Just love the show and couldn't give it a bad review even if I wanted to.
B000ZHS3E8|4.0|A film that notably requires you to envision a scenario where this can happen in our life time. If you enjoyed Event Horizon; you will enjoy this film.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I did not like the ending.  The wife was evil and I feel sorry for the child she will bear.  Hopefully, the father will be able to protect and influence the baby in a positive way.
B00DF92E7U|5.0|Wow, what a find!  This is a solid album start to finish.  Highly recommend, no doubt I will have this on repeat all day.
0553801473|5.0|Let me precede this review by saying that, in my opinion, this is the worst of any of the 5 ASOIAF books. I even enjoyed it less than AFFC. Why then, am I giving the book 5 stars? Because it is an excellent book! Being the worst of a spectacular series does not equate being bad.<br /><br />What I dislike about the book: Some parts truly did just drag on. Also, I disliked certain characters that were added to the book. Specifically: Old and Young Griff. I found that their addition completely upended the story without any good reason for doing so. They are pretty boring, and I hope they die.<br /><br />Overall, I found myself unable to put the book down. I blazed through it in about 9 days of heavy reading. George RR Martin really does know how to flesh out a story. The environments he develops are rich, the characters are endearing and intriguing, and the story is engaging. Despite the slow plot progression, a number of the plots really did have interesting, unexpected, and delightful twists. It was a wonderful experience reading through the book. I wish I always had a book that I loved as much by my side - life would be so enhanced.<br /><br />I recommend this book to anyone who has read and enjoyed the first four books. Sure, we are going to have to wait years for the next release, assuming it happens, but that does not change the fact that this book is superbly executed and a wonder to behold.<br /><br />Highly enjoyed. Highly recommended.
B000FC0V3E|5.0|Captures the lost generation better than any other book I've read. Thoroughly enjoyed the story and the dense characters. Classic by an all time great.
B00DPY95D6|5.0|What a fantastic thriller! First of all the author uses words that are easy to understand and to follow, as well as vivid imagery that contributes greatly to the reader's imagination. I do enjoy a good book with a fair bit of lawyers and court scenarios, and Cult of Mirrors most definitely delivers!  The book's protagonist, Cheryl Praetum, who is an attorney, is thrown into a whirlwind of cases against a school with powerful connections, when her services was retained by Daniel Bloom. There is also the looming presence of evil that haunts Cheryl as she experiments with bath salts, a designer drug, introduced to her by Travis Manning, an old friend.  This book is full of action, adventure, mystery and suspense as the reader witnesses Cheryl going through the darkest moments of her life!
B006ANJ4BW|2.0|you must first understand it.... and unfortunately the directors and/or writers missed it here. I hated to use the one line repeated so often in the film as a tag-line, but felt the need to do so to, just because I grew up reading the books and stories, etc. Sure, the cast was pretty decent, but Conan just lacked the heart I felt so often from reading the stories. I wonder if the directors and writers even read the original stories. I personally think that the original film with Ah-nold \\"I'll be back\\" Schwarzenegger followed Robert Howard's epic storyline better, showing more of the sword and sorcery feel of the ethos than this film did. This film wasn't absolutely terrible, it just missed the mark of what I, as a fan of Conan of Cimmeria, was looking for. This film had some great sword-play, but not much else, and honestly I was bored with it. I was hoping by the end the directors would at least have done something with the tag-line they used so much, but..... nothing. No answer for Conan, like the original at least attempted to do, no inner journey, no nothing. 2 stars, because had the film been released under another name and not tried to ride the coattails of the franchise so dear to many of R. Howard's fans, it would have stood fairly well on its own. As a Conan film, though, it fails.
0060734191|5.0|I've read these over and over again since I was in 9th grade. I love these books. They are wonderful to read. They have action, suspense, adventure, mystery and so much more packed inside the binding on those pages. Garth Nix is an author to follow. A lot of his other series and books are just as good.
B00BHNQ5XK|4.0|No spoilers here. Just, overall, a startling and somewhat unsettling movie. I love the historic and mythological connections made to The Boogie Man in this. Loved it. Check it out.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|I'm not a real Tarantino fan but this was a great &#34;revenge&#34; flick.  Lots of blood and guts so it's not for the faint of heart but the acting and storyline were great.
B0027MJU00|4.0|As the title suggests this book has some dark subjects.  I found it very interesting and was a page turned for me.  Had me guessing until the very end.
B002BU0DPE|5.0|the product came on time, and it is a very easy setup. the sound and bass is amazing. i have never heard anything clear. i recommend this product
B001P06GX4|5.0|We play this every so often, and it's fun for adults and the kids.  You do have to think through your moves, so good problem solving for the kids (8 and 10).
B003V4AK8E|4.0|the item arrived on time. i haven't tried it yet, but my wife needed a big controller to play on the ps3, if you want to play a bigger controller then that is for you.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Watching it now!!  Love Nathan Fillion and it's definitely a cult following movie.  It really does answer all of the questions -- well, almost all -- from the Firefly show.  Would have liked to seen a few more personal answers, but . . . oh well.  Good finally to the series.
B006M4F67A|5.0|This game is very addictive. Creative layouts I have never seen before. I would recommend this game to a friend.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Love Nathan Fillion on Castle so went back to watch the series.  It's a great Joss Whedon series and really can't see why it was cancelled.  Great cast and story line -- very unique.  I'll watch it again.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|This game is equally entertaining for kids younger and older. My 8 year old daughter really likes it and I enjoy it also. I love the social feature that restricts her from having &quot;friends&quot; she does not know and instead gives her the game characters as friends.
B009OYTAL8|5.0|The comic doesn't have too much to add, but it's good.  Love this show and can't wait for next season!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I got all  the dragon's it took me a year and 2months and 18 days 17min alon jbyg ugy ugy did not now what to riet
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|There is nothing original, or Judge dredd in this movie. the story line was stolen from both Escape from New York and die hard. I'm curious about who told the actor to use the batman voice and snake plissken attitude. It didn't work, although it was less amusing than the Stallone original voice. The Stallone version was large and enthralling. The latest version is contrived and overly in love with the slow motion violence that little gamer boys love. I'm curious as to why they didn't just hire Sydney the janitor to play Dredd. They could have covered him and had a voice over and gotten as good if not better performance. the actor was never seen, (unlike the little girl who was the focus of the movie)and he was simply used as an accessory, like a purse. Non of the Judge Dred storyline was used and the film had none of the massive reality of the cursed earth and why these people were herded into this city. It was just intended to be a two advertisment for a video game and it failed badly. Weak writing, incredibly weak directing and wasted acting talent. It cost $190 million and made $37 million world wide. It could have been so great with the addition of talent on the writing and directorial end, but then they possibly couldn't have used that cute little blonde girl, which I suspect was the real point of the movie making process.<br /><br />p.s.<br />At least they worked on the costuming. The cod piece was left out and the bright 90's colors. Too bad they didn't use the costumes and steal the story from Judge Dredd. That would have been a good movie.
B000I9VZJ8|4.0|This was a low budget movie I heard about but never wanted to see. My kids wanted to see and and I laughed so hard at just how odd it was that I watched a few more times. Offbeat, and fun
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This was an incredible book I loved every page! I can't wait for the next book to come out!!! Sooo excited!!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I needed to read this for summer reading did no think it would be so amazing I loved loved loved it. It was a great read.
B0084AZXKK|4.0|I loved reading this classic on my Kindle Fire. I could take my time and read out by the pool without any worry that the pages would get damaged. I had forgotten how wonderful a book it is. I found myself reading as if I was a pirate. Loads of fun
B008Y79IUE|4.0|It was hard core  as in not lacking<br />Showing details on<br />what drugs  coukd do yo you<br /><br />Very good movie !
B008133MDK|5.0|Looking forward to Season 3.<br /><br />Great show with great acting. I can see why so many people have been recommending it.
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|Very well written and pieced together beautifully, took my breath away.Ally Condie a must read for middle schoolers or junior highers.
B00D4CH5NG|5.0|I first heard the song ''Down by the river'' in a fly fishing short video. The song stuck with me and I bought the album... I am very surprised that this album has no review yet!<br /><br />It is an awesome mellow and relaxed alternative album. A must in any music aficionado's collection.<br /><br />Great debut album!!
1452126577|5.0|Great book for pet lovers - young and old alike.  My 10 year old daughter loves this book and so do I.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Loved it and this period in history.  Can't wait for season 4 to find out Matthew's fate and see the familiar faces which grace the screen.
B00785P2QC|4.0|I really enjoyed playing this. My only complaint is that the tutorials leave a lot to be desired. I would have built differently knowing the things I do now.
B0089LOG02|5.0|This is easier to read than most books that could be called &#34;historical fiction&#34; because half the book covers the perspective of a girl in foster care in the present. The elderly woman who was on the orphan train at the start of the 20th century is still alive, in her 90s, in the present, and the book links the present with the historical period through her encounters, in the present, with the young girl. Though so much is different - the meaning of &#34;rural&#34; now versus 90 years ago, children's rights and workers rights now versus then, technology - 90 years also seems reduced in time because the character who had those memories is still alive in the present. It makes history seem especially relevant, so that in the scenes that are set entirely in the past, there is no sense of escapism or storytelling for its own sake(not that there's a problem with that, and it's great storytelling, but it's even more powerful because it seems, without straining, to say something broader about the human condition in any time).
B00DW39B2K|1.0|mediocre script and poor dialogues, worn out topic, wander why de niro and travolta embarass themselves in these b movies....
B00CWV8TIU|5.0|This is the first movie that has held me in considerable suspense the whole way through!<br />I loved it. It had elements of foreign awesomeness!
B00821PCJS|5.0|We started watching this series over the summer and have found both the plot lines and the characters to be very interesting and well-done.  The first two seasons are available, and hopefully season three will be on Amazon Prime very soon.
B00EFNXPFK|3.0|Continuum is still my favorite. This album is fine but I miss his old music! Oh Come on Mr. Mayer
B0010X8NF0|5.0|Wes Anderson is an amazing director, this movie, and all his others are classics in my book, quirky, artistic, emotional, and everything with shipping & payment was fine!
B007IK44CK|4.0|It was good. The main villain was not developed enough and Tom Cruise is focusing his career on becoming the new Bruce Willis but not as gritty. I've watched it twice and one of those times was while doing something else. It fills time but not a movie that compares to the original
B0031ES8P6|5.0|It was a gist fro my god daughter, and she absolutely loved it. I love the fact that Hello Kitty things are always cheaper in price with Amazon.
B008JFUQ3O|5.0|This movie is awesome. this is better and funnier than the first film. don't get me wrong the first movie is awesome two. the one thing I love about this movie is that they find more new things for the minions to do and more comedy. I loved the bad guy el macho \\"He Died A Macho Way\\" if you seen the movie you know what i'm talking about if not it is one of the funniest scenes in the film. I thought that the film makers outdid themselves in this movie and lucy was a good addition to the characters. I hope they do another one. and I loved how they kept the original cast and that they made the characters even more loveable. if you have not seen this movie then I recommend you do
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I bought this from Best Buy while browsing around. I had heard about it on the blogs and I saw a whole stand almost cleaned out but 3 left so I figured why not. I thought I would regret it but not only am I impressed but this is probably the best $35 I have ever spent. Google well done I almost bought Apple TV since I am a Mac/iOS user but ill pass on it and stick with this. No wires and very mobile and compact. Works really well with my Macbook and iPad
B004LROUNG|4.0|Kind of rambled on.<br />Not as good a read as some of his others.<br />I did enjoy it though.<br />I will certainly continue to follow his books.
B006XBSAP2|3.0|My goddaughter loves Katy P, I don't see what's so great about her music. Aesthetically she is great, but I have ears and good hearing, so I'm not a fan. Then again the cd isn't for me and I made a child happy, so all is okay in our little world.
B009WUAK2M|2.0|Only real reason to watch the movie is to see all the heroes of yesteryear of screen on more time. The jokes illicit half-smiles at best, and the shoot-out and brawls aren't much better than what you get on youtube. You keep watching just to finish, but you realize you should have stopped after the first 20 minutes.
140006922X|5.0|ANY book that actually gets people thinking about their faith deserves a thumbs up in my opinion!  This book was well-written.  It interspersed story and historical detail which made the book interesting. I finished it quickly in just two days and hope MANY Christians will read it and start talking about their faith.
B0055OK2T0|2.0|Beautifully made, well written, well acted, etc. ... I thought I was in for a treat, a run-from-dangerous-powers-that-no-one-else-understands-are-out-to-kill-you type movie and instead it is a metaphysical romance. I guess that's why I hadn't heard much about it since it came out and looked good. Matt Damon seems to be getting a little long-in-the-tooth for this type of role, too, although I think I would still love him in anything Bourne. He looks great, I'm just not sure his commitment was completely there ... it seemed like it was, which might have been his biggest acting feat. I dunno, maybe this was his project, but I have a feeling he realized this one wasn't going to go over all that well, especially if people were hoping for something Bourne-esque. However, I wasn't a huge fan of other metaphysical romances What Dreams May Come and Meet Joe Black, and parts of those movies linger for me, so maybe only time will tell with this one. It is a Philip K. Dick story, after all ... oh, sacrilege, that I didn't like a Philip Dick story. I guess we can't be right all the time.
B009P5K4HK|5.0|The packaging came shattered and some slight scratches on the disk.  However, the performance is excellent and the DVD about a small intimate concert is very nice.
B000ICXQXI|4.0|Surprise, surprise, what I remembered from this Hitchcock classic, which deviated a great deal from his usual but of course astonishingly good fare, was ... of course ... the shower scene. Along with The Man Who Knew Too Much, actually, according to his resume on IMDB, his second telling of that story, he was ushered into a new era of the 50's and 60's when a lot changed, especially the mores. The Man Who Knew Too Much did not show this, but it was modern Hitchcock, as opposed to his elegant stylings of the 40's. He would go on to make the questionable but thoughtful Marnie and The Birds, and end with the disorganized Frenzy, not something anyone wanted to see but which showed his age. Middle-aged murder victims in their stockings, though preferable because not so tragic, are not anyone anyone wants to see.<br /><br />Perhaps, then, Psycho was Hitchcock's last great movie. Again, what it is known by and how we remember it, is the shower scene, which occurs before half of the movie is done ... and did not feature a middle-aged person in her stockings, although when the movie was made, Janet Leigh's lingerie, in which she did show up, would have been titillating to many, plus, presumably, the idea that she was naked in the shower. But there is so much more to the movie. Hitch often explored the results of a damaged mind in truly Freudian fashion, but this may have been the apex of that; the focal character's acting out was so extreme, and yet in the end we are given such a thorough explanation along psychological lines. The movie is in black and white, which adds to the starkness. It begins on a very modern note of a liason of the type that was to become the norm, premarital bliss. While that has always been with us, in certain upstanding middle class circles it was highly frowned upon right up to that point and a little beyond. Everything changed when The Pill was introduced.<br /><br />As has often been noted, in Psycho, we lose a major star near the beginning. Butthe other actors do an admirable job of carrying the rest of the movie. I was never big on Vera Miles later on tv, but she is a discovery in this movie. The other famous faces in supporting roles are more than adequate; in one of them, the theme of the focal character's disease is continued. I suppose it's silly to try to not give anything away, that's how famous the plot is, but that's why I'm being a little cryptic here. Interestingly, a remake of Psycho 40 years later was amazingly faithful to the original down to the star playing the Janet Leigh role being quite reminiscent of her. It was shot in color and starred Vince Vaughn, which, in retrospect, seems a bit of miscasting as his forte is comedy. The remake added a little depth ... notably, a funereal cast of hands in the mother's bedroom ... but was such a carbon copy and yet somehow ended with less suspense that, while a worthwhile effort and a piece of Americana, I'm not sure it needed to have been made. The fact that the filmmakers couldn't seem to improve on the original is perhaps a testament to Psycho's greatness. It also forever marked its leads, not in a way they would have wanted. It's a lasting impression, which probably also testifies to how real it was, how applicable to the truth of what really happens in a killing by a psychopath. I think it might tend to be remembered more as a stain on experience. But it is one that we occasionally have to look at in society.
B00881VLCE|4.0|I like the space that keeps your pieces out of the way.  I also find it convenient to get just the border pieces, then the others.
B0080SZ0V8|4.0|I love these type of games and this one is no different, just wish it was a bit longer, but it is fun to go back and start from the beginning, the puzzles are switched up each time
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Love this game.  This is not you're typical hidden object game. There are problems and puzzles to solve. There pictures are simple but good.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Fun game.gives you enough energy so you don't have to wait forever to get anywhere and isn't too difficult to figure out.
B00DGN51O8|3.0|This was an ok movie.  I kind of kept waiting for the action scenes to start but they never did.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Love this game just swim around eating stuff so much fun. Plays good on my phone it was free!!! Worth a try for anyone I'M A SHARK!!! This was my first review cause its the best game ever
