1441761268|4.0|The audio is told in alternating voices from the point of view of Lavina, and then Belle.  This made for a delectable story as Lavina was a young white girl who did not always see things as they truly were.  Belle could give a retelling of what was happening from an African American slaves perspective.  By the book bring told in this way, as readers we are allowed to see things unfold from all angles.<br /><br />There is a lot of front information before the book really gets moving.  In the beginning you are witness to the fondness that not only Lavina has for the people of the kitchen house, but the love they have for her as well.  Through Belle's telling, we see some of the white people for who they truly are, in full color descriptions, where Lavina may see things in more gray shades.  As the story gets moving, these shades of gray burst into full color as Lavina grows, marries, and starts to see how things really are.<br /><br />While I found the first half of this audio interesting, it was not until the second half that the story really takes off and you get a full understanding of all the details laid out in the earlier part of the book.  As events began to topple over one another I felt the story click together like a Rubics Cube and I loved the way it did!
0061537969|5.0|It is no secret to anyone who knows me that I am not much of a reader of anything other than mathematical journals.  Me read this book?  A novel?  I almost never even pick one up.  If I do and I read a half dozen pages, that is a lot.  A friend gave me this book for a favor I did for her and her children.  It sat for a few weeks before I decided to read the first page.  Hesitantly I picked it up on evening and started reading it.  It was different!  I was captivated within the first two pages.  This has NEVER happened before in my half century plus of existence.  Being a math teacher I looked at how many pages were in the book and thought about how long I wanted to take to read the entire book.  OK.  Three-hundred-twenty-one pages over a period of lets say two weeks.  That comes to almost twenty-three pages per day.    I cannot say it had me to the point where I could not put the book down but it did hold my interest as no other book ever has.  The first day I read forty-four pages; almost twice the amount I had planned to read per day.  But that was ok because tomorrow something may come up and I may not get a chance to read.  The next evening nothing did come up so I decided to \\"read ahead\\".  I read to page one-hundred-sixteen.  The third day I started reading and kept going to around page two-hundred and put the book away, but later that same evening I picked the book back up and finished it.  Three days for me to read a book?  Incredible!  Never happened before and may never happen again in my lifetime.    This book is so well written and can be related to real life so good (especially for dog owners) that you almost feel like you are Enzo's owner or at very least, you wish you were, or you had a dog like him.  Take it from a person who really does not like to read, this book is worth reading!

B001C4AFOY|5.0|Emily Blunt and Rupert Friend were wonderful in this movie! I never realized how much Queen Victoria went through. It is a beautiful story, with a look into how much responsibility it is to be born into royalty. The day to day workings of her life, the sacrifices she must make, protocol and during all that she falls in love with an amazing man. This was a bit of everything, politics, history, love, drama and it held my interest from start to finish. You must buy it. I have watched it over and over. My husband even liked it!!

B003Y5H57E|4.0|Great movie with a great plot twist at the end, that I never saw coming. Funny lines though out, sometimes a little over the top.  If nothing else, Ryan Gosling without his shirt makes this movie very enjoyable,
B0034G4OVS|1.0|I can't believe I wanted to see this movie; I am glad I waited for Netflix to stream the movie online before I went and spent money on it.<br /><br />The plot is simple enough 3 college age kids are out at a ski resort. Two guys who are best friends and one of their tag-along girlfriends. They don't seem to bring enough money to pay for the ski-lift so the guys convince the girlfriend to flirt with the chair lift guy to give them a free ride. They take one and then convinced the guy to give them one last ride before he shut down for the night. The guy argues with them about it but they eventually change his mind and get on the lift.<br /><br />My thought on this: you get what you pay for...next time listen to the guy who says they're closing up for the night. He may not appear to be the smartest guy on the block but he knows his job enough to keep it.<br /><br />Eventually things lead to them getting stuck on the lift. After sitting there for hours one decides he's going to jump and it doesn't end well for him...breaks both legs, then the wolves' descend. First one and then they scare him off by throwing a ski board at it. It comes back with the pack and down goes the first victim of the movie. I'm not going to sit and debate the likelihood of this happening, I don't know much about wolves so I can't say if they'd attack a human under any circumstance.<br /><br />After that happened, and the hailstorm, the girl (hunter) wakes up to find her uncovered hand is frozen to the metal chair-lift. Shouldn't this have crossed her mind if she had known their faces were already being covered with frost-bite then to lay her frost-bitten hand over the iced pole that it wasn't a smart idea?<br />After the second male wakes up he climbs his way up to the cables and makes his way down. Fights off the wolves and lives Hunter promising to come back for her. She falls asleep for an un-said amount of time and falls off the lift either on purpose or by accident I haven't exactly figured that out yet. She breaks her fall in half by pulling the chair down, still manages to hurt her leg but crawls and falls down the snow filled mountain.<br /><br />The movie is almost over but I still don't have deep seeded care for the characters even after the death of two of them. I'm not a cruel person but I guess I just didn't bond with the characters all that well. At the end of the movie instead of feeling sympathy I more so felt like, who cares...by pulling the chair down, still manages to hurt her leg but crawls and falls down the snow filled mountain.

1439130833|5.0|I read the other reviews prior to purchasing and it seemed like the only negative point was that you had to tear each page out which made it good for only one year.  So I used a clothes pin to hold the previously read pages back so I didnt have to tear them out and throw them away, so far it is working.  And I like that it does not include dates, I was able to buy mid-year and still use it for an entire year.  I love it, I read the messages each morning and it is a great way to start my day.  I just purchased it for a friend for Christmas as well.

B004LWZW4M|5.0|If you haven't seen this movie please continue watching it once the initial credits come on after the \\"ending\\" where the lead ape speaks. I almost missed that FINAL scene first time I saw the movie.  If you know the history of this story, the final scene with the mean neighbor/airline pilot and the implication that a disease he contracted when Caesar bit him during a fight will infect the rest of the world his plane flies do, you'll enjoy it even more. I hate it when movie makers begin the credits when there is still an important scene to show!  A lot of folks had already left the theater and didn't get to see it.  Thank God there was slow moving crowd in front of me...  I saw the original Planet of Apes several years ago and loved it.  I didn't care much for the sequels that followed, especially the remark with Mark Wahlberg.  With the exception of The Godfather, I had not seen ONE sequel of any other movie I liked.  This prequel is outstanding!  I sat through it three times in a row and then returned to various theaters on five other ocassions to see it again.  I can't wait for the DVD to be released!  I loved James Franco, his leading lady, John Lithgow, and the African scientist Steven Jacobs (he was also fantastic as Idi Amin's doctor in Last King of Scotland).  However, if anyone in this movie deserves the oscar or any other award, it's man who played Caeser, the leader of the Apes.  What truly impressed me about this movie was the fact that the apes look so real!  I saw a special documentary on cable where they showed the \\"apes\\" in human form and then how they made them look like real apes through some kind of computer enhancement.  Being a Bay Area resident, the 'Frisco setting--especially all of the action on the Golden Gate Bridge was fantastic.  Once the apes triumphed and the cops on the bridge took off running, everyone in the movie theater, especially me cheered and clapped for the apes!

B0061JPYX2|5.0|Picked this album up tonight after reading mixed reviews on the subject matter. I think Amy Winehouse had brilliant music and it was classic. Having only listened to 3 or 4 songs so far, I really like it. Makes me kind of sad because the Music Industry and people everywhere have lost someone very, very special. Amy was a true artist. Yes, she had her bad times, but she was amazing. She didn't need all the fake background noise to drown out off key singing, or in many cases LIP-SYNCHING, AHEM. Sorry Adele, but Amy was here first!! You will forever be immortalized Amy, people will never forget you. Fantastic final collection from a musical giant. &lt;3 MUAH!!

B005YVTHT0|5.0|If you're a Formula 1 or an Indycar fan then this is definately a wheel to consider.  I'm a big Formula 1 fan and have been looking for a wheel that duplicates the controls of an actual Formula 1 wheel for a while.  Well this is it.<br />The wheel is very sturdilly made and the buttons, dials and controls on the wheel are large enough and spaced far apart enough that you don't mistakenly push a button or turn a dial by mistake.  The sheer number of buttons and settings this wheel has really does make it feel like you are using a Formula 1 wheel and you quickly realize just what a Formula 1 driver has to go through during a race.  You have the pit lane speed limiter button, launch control, request pit in, front brake balance, rear brake balance and on and on.  Then there are the dials allowing you set such things as anti-lock brakes, shift sensitivity, clutch, traction control etc. (I know a lot of these are currently banned on a Formula 1 car but this wheel is not just for Formula 1 racing).<br />The Simraceway SRW-S1 wheel is primarily designed to be used in conjunction with the Simraceway simulator, which is a free download, however you can use the wheel with most other race games (after a little setup). I tried it with Formula 1 2010 and it worked just fine.  A lot of driving games however won't make use of the full array of controls available on the wheel as the wheel was designed to be used primarily with the Simraceway simulator.<br />Although the Simraceway simulator is a free download, there are things you have to pay for like extra cars, tracks etc. The wheel actually comes with a pre-paid card giving you some online currency in order to get you started.  The simulator is primarily designed for online racing although you can race around the tracks in single player mode trying to beat your own track times and practice each track before you go online racing.  The graphics leave much to be desired (it's like taking a step back to the early 2000's) but the car control and handling are top notch so it's not really an arcade driving game but a proper simulator.<br />I normally use a full wheel, pedals and stick shifter kit so it took a little bit getting used to the accelerator and brake on the back of the wheel and also having the wheel not attached to a base, but just freely floating in your hands. This is perhaps the wheels only downside. Giving the price of the wheel, you can buy a rudimentary wheel and pedal system for the same price.<br />Apart from the price there is really nothing I can fault this wheel for, controls are responsive and placed correctly for easy access without having to have huge hands.<br />Recommended especially for anyone who wants to know what a Formula 1 racer actually feels like.handling are top notch so it's not really an arcade driving game but a proper simulator.

B0058VA2U4|5.0|Not ever being a huge fan of Anthrax, owning some albums in the early 90's, I recently dug back into their back catalog, Spreading The Disease and Among The Living in particular.  I'd always been more into Metallica, Megadeth, JP and IM.  I forgot how insane they were and how good they were.  Anyway, it prompted me to give Worship Music a try and I'm glad that I did.  It rocks all the way through and it doesn't just remind me of the good ole days, it's fresh and it breaths new life into the classic thrash metal genre and I can't stop listening to it.

B006ANJ4BW|2.0|SPOILER ALERT:  Evil guy kills boy's father.  Boy grows up and kills evil guy.  That's it in a nutshell.  Even at $0.99 for rental, it felt like a rip-off.

B005HS00ZU|5.0|Peter Gabriel: New Blood-Live in London 3D Blu Ray is one of the best 3D discs I have purchased.  Peter Gabriel has made this concert to be watched in three dimensions and the concert, the 3D effects, and the music are excellent. Paul Simon once wrote \\"These are the days of miracles and wonder\\" this Blu Ray will confirm his declaration.  They used numerous 3D cameras to record this disc and you actually feel that you are there and you will see infinite varieties of depth in the orchestra and the audience.  The special effects are there too so you will have stuff popping out of the screen as well as feeling as if the performers were in your living room.  Peter Gabriel has aged but his skills as a performer have not diminished although he looks like a fat old guy. That is a bit disconcerting if you have been a fan since the days of his historic rock group Genesis.  The \\"New Blood\\" of the title refers to The New Blood Orchestra which admirably accompanies him. This concert was recorded in London in March 2011.  There are many songs on the disc and the only fault I could find is that I wasn't familiar with the new material from his album \\"Scratch My Back\\".  There is plenty of his older music too and the new stuff is great I just was not familiar with it.  You do not need liner notes to know what the lyrics are.  Peter Gabriel and his backup singers enunciate so the words are clear as a bell.  If you are a fan of Peter Gabriel you should purchase this disc in 3D.  It is 3D for adults and not just another animated piece of 3D schlock. Watch it on a large 3D screen if you can.  If you are going to buy a new TV buy the largest you can afford.  Whatever brand of television, whether 3D or not, nobody was ever sorry that they didn't buy a smaller TV.

0307887898|3.0|I found some ideas in the book very valuable. For example setting milestones by validated learning was new to me. So I enjoyed the anecdotes and a couple of other ideas, but you cannot help telling yourself \\"OK, get to the point\\" while reading. The problem is the book itself is not lean. I think it could have been much concise thus shorter.  My suggestion is that irrespective of your level on startups, read it very fast on the first go. If you are novice, you'll know where to come back and read more carefully, slowly. If you are a seasoned startup guru, you'll probably get what you want and be happy with the anecdotes and maybe a couple fresh ideas.  In both cases, I think there is value in the book, but you have to look for it.

B00009Z576|4.0|In the Fall of 1979, Yes went into the studio but during the sessions, Jon Anderson and Rick Wakeman became discouraged left the band. Yes manager Brian Laine also managed a group called The Buggles (Trevor Horn and Geoff Downes) who had just had a hit with a song called Video Killed The Radio Star. The Buggles were working in a studio down the hall from Yes and, being fans, went over to say hi. Chris Squire liked their album and before long, Yes was reborn. Drama was released in the Summer of 1980. Unfortunately, the album wasn't well received with a lot of fans at the time which is too bad because most of it is quite good. I still remember a lot of people giving me a bit of a hard time for listening to it and \\"Are YOU a camera?\\" jokes were everywhere. After the tour, Trevor quit and the band folded.<br /><br />The album is actually pretty strong and opens with a hard edge called Machine Messiah that clocks in at just over 10 minutes and features cool songs like Into The Lens, Tempest Fugit, and Run Through The Light. In fact, I don't think any of the original Drama songs are actually bad. This remaster also features several bonus songs including the single versions of songs from the album mixed in with studio outtakes. Some of the studio outtakes even feature Jon before he left. While this isn't the band's best, in my opinion, it isn't their worst either.
1451648537|3.0|One of the things I love about Amazon is reading the reviews. The author is certainly up to the task of writing this. I am about the same age as Jobs, have made a career of the industry and have seen the many freak facets of it (A LOT has NOT been achieved). Personally, I was never enamored with the Apple platform (as originally conceived, MAC included). Jobs in my mind was a brilliant marketer foremost and an above average designer second. Wozniak was really the circuit guy and interior founder. Jobs would have been \\"Nowhere\\" without him.  Fast forward to the I-phone. The use of semi-slave labor in China is inexcusable. The company is really not a computer company anymore, but a highly sophisticated movie/music jukebox client/server host. My verdict on Steve? Brilliant, BUT I think his lack of compassion and philanthropy are major black marks on his record. I will get around to reading it eventually.
B004EPYZSU|4.0|It captured the essence of being a Western.  It would be really easy for the whole SciFi/alien angle to overpower the western aspect and get stupid but it never did.  It's a movie that isn't supposed to work but did anyways.<br /><br />The acting was great, if Tron Legacy didn't do it for me already now I really have the hots for Olivia Wilde.<br /><br />The only thing I have trouble with in the entire movie is how few people recognized the main character.  If you have any idea how rural small communities work you would know at one or two people in town at the least would recognize the main character as soon as he walked in.  This is true of anyone with a house within one and maybe even two days riding distance, and this character's house was obviously within a days ride.  The lack of character recognition was a major plot point, but it really didn't work with him having a home close by.<br /><br />Now, for the Ultra Violet Digital copy aspect so many of you are interested in since it's new.<br /><br />It worked.<br /><br />There was some murky directions and uncertainty in my initial setup.  Let me clarify, you have to go to the Ultra Violet site to setup an account THEN you have to do the whole URL and number thing from the provided coupon.  One does link to the other, but it's not really clear.  After you register at the Ultra Violet site, then you register/redeem at Universals, THEN you log into a content providers site with a coupon code.  I chose Amazon because it's the only one I use.  I recall Vudu, iTunes and one other I don't recall being on the list.  I now have this movie not only on BluRay and DVD, but I also have it in my Amazon collection which is great, even if a meteorite strikes my apartment while I'm out I'll at least still have the digital copy.<br /><br />I'm a Linux user, I'm generally against DRM, but the whole store it on Amazon watch it online aspect isn't so bad, partially because it's OS agnostic.  Except for Android.  I can't play it on Android right now to save my soul.  There's a nifty PocketBlu app that's useless to me because it doesn't like the fact my phone is rooted.  I have a choice, I can have a rooted phone and have two days worth of battery, or I can put the original firmware back on, and have 12 hours worth of battery even if I don't actually use my phone because the spyware my provider installed is constantly transmitting and calling home with all sorts of privacy invasion.  So watching it from my phone is right out.  As for the second screen remote control awesomeness part of the app?  It doesn't work either.

I know my network configuration is just fine because I can remote control my BluRay player with the LG app and I can do nifty DLNA/UPnP things with my player and other software on my phone.<br /><br />I wrote a really long review on the whole Ultra Violet thing on my Live Journal, but Amazon doesn't like for you to put links in reviews.

0345440900|5.0|I started reading this book when our little guy was about 3 weeks old, and I finished it in two days. Tracy is so reassuring, and gives so many great tips for sleep time, play time, and bath time. Since we started using her EASY system, it has become 1,000 times easier to figure out why our little guy is crying. Because of EASY, he is well-fed, well-rested, and I feel confident that he is getting what he needs. I LOVE the chart in the book that details the different reasons why babies cry. It gives you sound and visual cues to look for in your baby, and then effective ways to respond. I have told so many people about this book, and I'm gifting it to all of the soon-to-be mommies I know!  PS: When I was deciding whether or not to get this book, I read a lot of reviews that made it seem like Tracy was anti-breastfeeding. That is not the case at all. I chose to breastfeed, and I thought it was clear that she simply advocated for the moms to make their own choice. Then you could read the section of the book (either breast or formula feeding) that was appropriate for your choice.
B004XGN8W4|2.0|I've recently bought this for gaming on the go, great concept, what i've always wanted, an all in one contain game console device.<br />In actuality the screen is not that great, viewing angles are poor, especially vertical angles and to make it worst there are no mechanical tilt adjustment or lock like on most computer monitor or vesa mounts. You will basically have to lean the back of the screen on a wall or a piece of furniture to get optimal viewing angle.<br /><br />But it get worst, if you use the unit about an arm length away you'll see fine grid lines in the lcd, like a thin window screen on your lcd, but you will not notice if you sit 4-5 ft away, but it will make the screen feel like it's on the small side, sitting at that distance.<br /><br />And Last, the Contrast Ratio is not all that good, my 10 year only 15inch nec lcd monitor has better black levels, when playing dark contrast games like resident evil, gears of war, etc. blacks levels look wash out/grayish.<br /><br />I can only reccommend this to parents who have kids that travel around and need a gaming console to entertain or calm there kids down.<br /><br />For about the same amount of money you can buy a pelican case, a few screws, velcro straps from your local hardware store, and vesa mountable hi quality 17-23in hdmi monitor led,1080p,etc and get better result.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|This case is well constructed, light, and minimalistic. I like that it adds almost no bulk. It acts like a second skin that functions well as a stand and looks good doing it. The corners that hold the fire in place also act as reinforcement. (I found this out after a puppy induced drop.) A week of constant use has left me both happy and impressed with this product. I will be looking to Marware first for future case purchases for all of my devices!
B0063IH60K|4.0|it can be portrait or landscape, which is nice. not crazy about the advertising (yes, i caved and downloaded freecell, too) but at least it's not insane like words with friends. watch out, the number five is hard to read. really like the tap once instead of dragging, and the option to auto complete.
1451627289|4.0|King goes back to what made him great and that's vivid characterization and imagery. He brings to life a simpler era. The novel moves at a fast pace at the beginning, but it drags a little in the middle and gets tied up in small town life and happenings. I, the reader, probably could have done without so much small town life. The ending was a little too over the top for me. It could have ended after he changed history and left it to the readers' imaginations as to what actually changed in the future. I would have given it 5 stars if not for middle and end.
B005NPCJ88|5.0|Awesome Band !  Great album . Excellent musicians / songs .<br />one of the best Modern metal bands out there !<br />Buy / Download this !!!<br />Also seek out the band<br />SADDLEBACK SHARK here on AmazonMP3
B0063IH60K|5.0|Works just great on the Kindle Fire with no issues. Would recommend for anyone, a nice basic game with options for game play.
B0063GORYU|5.0|great app for killing time a++ a plus for the Android market when it comes to simple apps. would be nice to have custom backgrounds but still a great app.
B001UV4XIS|4.0|As with all the movie vs book a general license is granted to incorporate as much of the written plot in to the actual film.  Still, all in all an enjoyable conclusion to the \\"Harry Potter\\" series.  Dark characterization of \\"evil\\" even more so than the previous books.  Well done finale.
B0058VW36U|1.0|where's the tool box update?! I love this game, but no update and it's been weeks since the update came out in the android market! :(
B000FBFN1U|5.0|In science fiction, dan simmons hyperion cantos is the benchmark.  Now in fantasy, martins \\"a song of ice and fire\\" is the benchmark.  Nuff said. Period.  Dont.even.try.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Typically I am not a game player, but this game is addicting.  I love the game and it's a great distraction while waiting at the doctor's office.  Two beaks up!!  Rated 4 stars because sometimes it force close at the most inopportune time.
B006FTCH2E|5.0|So, if you need to see X breathlessly running across a field toward Y (really, how far would x have to run to get to Y, anyway?), see X shoot Y, or are looking for X to blast Y away with special effects, skip this movie.<br /><br />It doesn't require that you carry a Mensa membership card to understand it. But, it does require - at least - the ability to appreciate dialog, expressive features, plotting, and great ideas. While it is excellent on all those points, it is the great ideas that linger after viewing Another Earth, the questions.<br /><br />So, why have some viewers panned this? Sometimes you're just in the mood for entertainment, fun. Sometimes though, you're in the mood for a Citizen Kane. Certainly, Another Earth is not in the company of that great Orson Welles opus. But, it tries. It does tend more toward the art house variety of entertainment. It is obviously not the beneficiary of budgetary largess. But, it is no slouch, either. It held my interest without wavering. Darn' if I don't want to see what happens each time Rhoda knocks on John's door. Will she tell him her secret?<br /><br />In addressing the desire to find some dignified purpose(and, maybe escape) after a tragic choice, Another Earth reflects on fundamental human aspirations: How do I right my wrongs and how do I face myself and my past. Sometimes, we aren't ready to ask those questions. But, in Another Earth, X and Y can't be bothered with lesser things.
B0055SWM08|5.0|For those who like puzzles quell is a must have in your app library, definitely worth buying. I like how the graphics are also high quality.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I just learned how to play solitaire and I think playing it for the frist time on my kindle fire was the best way to learn
B0063IH60K|5.0|Easy to play and fun for all ages with many levels. Fast reactive response to moves. Very addictive!  Best free game app I have so far!
0307891372|5.0|I am not a fan of game guides, usually they have so many errors that they end up feeling like a waste of money. I bought this one because Skyrim is so huge, and there are so many quests that I was a little overwhelmed. Being a the kind of gamer who likes to do as much as possible, I was encouraged by the positive reviews, and they are well deserved. The guide covers so much, dungeons, quest lines (like all the thief guild quests, the civil war quests from both sides), and has maps galore. There are even spoiler alerts at the beginning of every quest line. If you are looking for a lot of information, or just a little, this guide is well worth the money. It almost restores my faith in printed game guides!
B001GKJ2E8|4.0|Really like the special effects and style of this movie.  Cast is very good.  Amazon.com has good prices and fast delivery.  Good place to shop when a department/specialty store is 20 miles away or more.
B00509ODFO|5.0|Best show ever! It's a shame that it was canceled prematurely. Hoping that another network will pick it up where it was left off.
B00003CXA6|5.0|In my humble opinion the best civil war movie ever.  All star cast, who don't get in each other's way.  nice to finally have it on DVD (have had the VHS forever)
B005UBNKZG|4.0|the fan is noisy with the stock cooler. i recommend to get a better cooler for this thing. it generates alot of heat.
B005N95JA4|3.0|Why didn't the Rolling Stones include the over 9 minute 12\\" disco single of 'Miss You'?  It was huge back in the days of discotheques.  There is plenty of room on the CD as the original album is only about 45 minutes long.  That would have been a real coup.
B005OCFHHK|4.0|I choose blu ray format because it has such great graphics. The picture was very crisp, clean.I was very happy when all 7 movies came out together and buying them in the box set saved money and space. Very happy with my purchase.
B004CIIXC8|3.0|Don`t think there was much point to this movie besides to show how far Hip Hop culture has penetrated European youth. There is a scene of inappropriateness with an underage female but no real story or consequence to it.
B004EPYZT4|5.0|Super entertaining. Thoroughly enjoyed it, and thought that it was better than the other era pieces. (i.e. Clash of the Titans) I was enthralled throughout, and it held my attention the whole time.
B002ECJZ76|5.0|This was an excelant movie for the whole family. I highly recommend this DVD for all ages. Very easy to understand the true meaning of Christmas for children.
B004GYY714|5.0|I have a 7 inch tablet just wifi and this baby has all my favorite local radio stations , is fast loading, sounds great and when i tire of them i can search the world market for something else.If you like talk radio it has all the different political preferences,and categories like religeon, etc. .If you just like comercial free oldies or classical or lite rock, what ever trips your trigger you can find it.If you see a news story say in Alaska and want to find what the locals are realy saying you can find it easily with this Tune In radio app.    BTW I would like to thank AMAZON for providing the public with an astounding amount of \\"FREE\\" apps. Also my tablet uses FROYO kinda old now but still is able to play and use thousands of apps..
B004EPYZSU|4.0|Great flick, but Universal Studios has included a Ultraviolet/Flixster copy in the Digital Copy insert.  Thankfully they did include a real iTunes redemption code is included.  Warner Bros. I can understand going to the evil side of UV streaming copies, hell they own the company.  But Universal et tu?  This is a bad bad sign.
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|this game is a retooled version of various games such as crush the castle and conquer the kingdom. its a terrible game
B0053O89KG|5.0|Typical Castle..... If you like the show you will like this \\"Castle: the Complete Fourth Season\\".  Film is of good quality.
B005K17RU0|1.0|Doesn't work on my Kindle Fire.  Asks for my location, finds it, displays the city name, but nothing else, just a black screen. If I hit the back button, I get a weather report but no indication of where it's for (somewhere in PA, I think).  Won't save a location.  Crashed once.  Easy to uninstall.
B004089HZ2|5.0|Boomsday took on what to do with the elderly and the rising cost of healthcare (SPOILER: kill them).  Now Buckley takes on the Tobacco Lobby in Thank You for Smoking about a lovable anti-hero who has the despicable job of convincing the world that smoking is fun and harmless.  Tons of laughs!<br /><br />~ Ken Baumbach, author of Mayageddon 2012
0618001905|5.0|This book is absolutely fantastic, There is no a single line is this book that is boring. The author is an awesome storyteller and covers this part of the history from all perspectives. Read it as a fiction but it  is actually factual. Great BOOK!
B004RJMUJO|4.0|I've only played this game 8-10 times since I downloaded it and it doesn't seem like there's a whole lot of game play (different levels) but it really is fun.  If you're stuck with nothing to do for a few minutes, this is a great way to fill that time.  Easy controls so anyone from a young child to a senior citizen could get the hang of it.  No issues at all playing it on an HTC Thunderbolt.
B004QK5N5W|5.0|Adorei comprar pelo Amazon.com. Super rápido e o preço muito bom. Fácil e ágil. Entrega no prazo esperado com todo o conforto de não precisar sair de casa.
B004EPZ0BG|3.0|I liked this movie, i liked Mila in it, but i thought Justin needs to practice more of his acting skills, i just think he could have been better in this movie.  It was sweet and funny. I just find it interesting that both Mila Kunis and Natalie Portman were in movies that dealt with the same storyline and they were both in Black Swan together. Maybe the writers in hollywood should start thinking of different stories and not recycle the same thing. (Example: Chasing Liberty and First Daughter)  I liked No Strings Attached more than i liked this movie, but i will probably watch this movie again
0061900656|4.0|This book is a cute story but mostly I like that it realistically portrays a baby (can't eat ice cream, pizza, sleeps a lot, etc) and plays up the pro's of being a big kid (get's to do all the fun things a baby can't do yet!). I bought it for my 2yr old son since were expecting his little brother and he really likes the pictures and pointing out the baby. I think these type of books are a good way to expose him a little to the idea that there's going to be someone new in the house while also not overwhelming him with baby information that would be over his head.
B006DHAT5K|3.0|I liked both of the characters, i really didn't see 20 guys such a bad thing since i know plenty of women who say they've slept with very few guys and i know for a fact that they've slept with more. I think it's more of quality not quantity that should matter the most any ways.   It's basically a story I've seen before where the girl is looking for Mr. Right and she doesn't see him right in front of her. Chris Evans is hot, especially coming out of his apartment in only a small towel ;)  The movie wasn't the best romantic comedy I've seen, but it wasn't the worst. It was funny at times and sweet the next, and it was slow in certain parts, but other than that i thought it was worth seeing, i wouldn't mind watching it again.
B00008GKEG|4.0|For a Beatle fan (like me) this 10 hour documentary was both thrilling<br />and just a little disappointing.<br /><br />Thrilling because all the music has been re-mixed, re-mastered and<br />sounds great, because there are lots of details that, even as I fan, I<br />didn't know, because there's more insight than offered elsewhere into<br />their breakup, and more important, into what held them together.<br /><br />A good job is done of combining new interviews with the then 3 living<br />Beatles, and recorded interviews with John from many sources, so his<br />views and insights aren't missing.<br /><br />The last couple of hours go deeper than I suspected, and were quite<br />moving.<br /><br />On the disappointment side there are a few issues. First, at least for<br />me, much of the first half got repetitive. Not much new insight into<br />the birth or meaning of Beatlemania, just lots (and lots and lots) of<br />concert and TV footage, often of them playing the same songs, sometimes<br />obviously just lip-syncing to records.<br /><br />Also, their personal lives are left out entirely. I understand not<br />focusing on relationships, etc, but there's virtually no mention of<br />wives, divorces, affairs, children, or how any of that intersected with<br />their music and work.<br /><br />Last, I was sorry it didn't go deeper into the creation of the music<br />itself. While there are lot of great tidbits from the group and George<br />Martin about specific songs, considering there was 10 hours of program,<br />I didn't get enough of how they worked, how they wrote, how they<br />influenced each other. Nor do we get much of their personal views of<br />the world, politics, etc. And somehow the sense of how much their brief<br />7 years meant to music and to world culture seems missing, or at least<br />not really explored.<br /><br />Yet, whatever was missing, I tore through the 10 hours in 2 nights, and<br />would have happily seen more.

B001F12J3Y|1.0|The film is 1950's 3D vintage.  I thought that it was a real 3D movie to view on my 3D Samsung Television.  Made me nautious in trying to watch the amatuer 3D.

0521673763|2.0|Categorizes ME (\\"CFS\\") and Fibromyalgia as 'functional somatic syndromes', a type of mental disorder.  For example. the book asks \\"Is it possible that Fibromyalgia has been as neglected as many other women's mental health issues?\\" (p.808).  There are over 5,000 articles in peer reviewed journals proving frank physical pathology in ME according to Harvard Med School Prof. Anthony Komaroff.<br /><br />It may seem harsh to rate the book only two stars.  However, the type of misinformation on ME it contains causes so much iatrogenic morbidity and even mortality, that I feel a two star review is merited.  I understand if you disagree.<br /><br />Pls correct these errors. Pls see the 2011 ME International Consensus Criteria for accurate info.  The authors may also contact me for free expert help.  Looking forward to giving the book five stars when this is corrected, since I have had a copy for years and have found it is generally excellent.  Thank you for your consideration!
B004B32500|5.0|If you love the trilogy Jodorowsky made(Fando y Lis, El Topo, Holy Mountain) then you'll definitely love Santa Sangre. Same vibe, similar atmosphere, and bizarre surrealism. It's a great follow up to his trilogy, and especially with his 20 years of absence in cinema. Five thumbs up.
140053271X|5.0|I have had my nook simple touch for a few weeks now- I previously owned a Sony Reader pocket edition, and I own a iPad. This device fills a niche- if you want to annotate pdf documents or watch movies or any of those other things, get a tablet or the iPad or the kindle fire. This device is designed to read books, and it does a beautiful job at it. I purchased my Sony reader expecting to be able to add comments in it, but it was way too difficult, and ultimately I decided to purchase an iPad. Like the Sony reader, the nook can take notes but wouldn't be a great device to purchase for that purpose.   It was pretty easy to set up- I didn't read the instruction manual, but I usually don't. I just followed the on screen instructions to connect it with my internet, my barnes and noble account, and then plugged it into my computer to sync it with library books. I had a bit of trouble connecting it with my internet, but that has happened with every new device I've purchased, so I think its my internet's fault, not the nook. I went through the steps a few times and then it started worked.   I really like holding it to read- I generally read ridiculously thick books, so its nice to have something small and light to hold instead of a massive book that I have to prop up (and its so much nicer to read from than an iPad- the iPad is fine to read from, and i never seemed to feel screen fatigue, but it is way too heavy to hold with one hand). Initially I didn't realize that the two buttons on either side of the screen move the page forward or back, so I was touching the screen each time- the delay time is a bit longer that way, and it was annoying to have to use both hands. As soon as I realized that the buttons existed, the experience got even better.   The battery life seems great- I charged it all the way up using my usb-to-outlet power adapter that I have for my iphone/ipad, and it worked great. I haven't had to charge it again, and I've been reading for about an hour each day.The one thing that surprised me and was frustrating for a few minutes was when I realized that I couldn't load my other epub books onto the nook because there wasn't enough room. The advertised size of the nook is 2gb, which is a ton of books, but it wasn't enough room for the books I've acquired through other sources- like google book downloads. A quick google search solved this problem- barnes and noble appropriates the majority of this space for content you purchase directly from barnes and noble. Fortunately there is an easy solution- there is a slot for a microSD card, and I happened to have a 2gb one lying around- plus they only cost about $5, if that. I popped it in, turned the device off and on, and I was ready to go again. Not a deal-killer by any means, but something to consider if you're planning to add your own epub library to your nook.   Kindle vs. Nook- I haven't owned a kindle, only used it for a few minutes, but my personal opinion as I decided which to purchase was this: price was important (and I got a great black friday deal on the nook), and since they were about the same price I wanted to support the more open epub format, since you can load books from other sources. Yes, its possible to convert epub to kindle format but its an extra step that many people won't be interested in. I would have purchased the kindle with special offers, and hadn't thought much about it, but I've enjoyed the pictures of authors that show up on my nook screen, and would probably get annoyed by the commercials/make a point to put my nook in a case so I didn't have to see them.  Durability- I haven't abused it by any stretch of the imagination- yet- but it did take a fall off a coffee table and didn't crack/break/show any sort of damage  I'll update my review as I have more time to play with it in the next few months
B0063IH60K|5.0|As easy as it needs to be and exactly what i want, nothing special.  Works well and some customization as well.
B002VPE1B6|3.0|First time I saw this was a favorable view on this movie by James Cameron, but when he annouced a 2nd verison of this movie, I said \\"yeah, I'm not going to spend another $80 for the special edition of the same movie!\\", \\"enough is enough\\" they pushed my luck after even purchasing this as I was skeptical (just seeing in the movie once is enough for me as if the movies are just favorable but not the BEST)  Good movie just to watch once or twice and it becomes dust in your blu-ray collection, just like my dvd collection as well :)
B005XN0SGU|5.0|I've tried all the major comic readers on Android Market and I have to say that aside from ACR, Perfect Viewer is the next best app. Comicat though somewhat promising is much less polished than this app. Everything just works here: zooming, scrolling, page turning, everything.<br /><br />The only thing I'd change would be to remove the action bar or at a full screen mode. Leave the interface gui's to desktop.

098357670X|5.0|This book is hands down one of the best art instruction books that I have seen, and should remain a classic for years to come. While it's focus is caricature, it is also a terrific resource for anyone learning to draw the head, face, hair and hands.  Tom is one of the best illustration practitioners out there. He also writes and presents well. His presentation style is detailed and analytical, yet clean and concise. All this while maintaining a light, humorous style. The book is self published, yet trumps the major publishing houses in terms of design, polish, and professionalism.   Chock full of information and highly recommended.
B005KDWUFA|5.0|Absolutely fantastic CD from four fantastic men!  All the songs on this are well worth the price paid for the CD.
1401324517|1.0|I expect this is a great book, I am a Rafa fan. But I bought it as new to be a gift. With its used appearance and dirty dust jacket, there is no way I would consider giving it as a gift.
B004EPYZSU|4.0|I really liked this film a whole lot better than I thought I would.....the western aspects of the movie were fun, well acted, and directed.  I thought much of it played as an homage to the Searchers.  Craig was really good, and I would love to see him in this genre again.  The sci-fi part was ok but I think the script never really came together.....I would have much preferred to see these characters continue in a classic western story.  What is great and 5 stars easily is the blu-ray itself..............the sound design and its reproduction on the DTS Masteraudio track is reference quality for both the loud battle sequences and the quieter moments in the film.  I was blown away....you have to hear it on a good system to get the impact.....This may be one of the best sound tracks I have ever heard.  Highly recommended for audiophiles and fans of the western....alien invasion fans should stick with Earth vs Flying Saucers:)
B0068RHSCW|3.0|\\"You've been living here and you don't know about the murders?\\" Will (Craig) and his family have found the perfect house in the perfect neighborhood to move into. When a local teenager is caught in their house she tells him about a murder that happened in the house 5 years ago. Will starts to investigate what happened and his neighbor Ann (Watts) helps. Will finds out a horrifying secret that may change the life of him and his family forever. This is a very strange movie in a couple ways. First, the acting and idea are great. All the main actors do a great job. The main problem with this movie to me is that nothing seems to happen. The acting keeps you watching and interested enough, but eventually you grow board with the lack of anything. For a horror movie this is very slow and drawn out. This is not a bad movie, and the last maybe 15 minutes is exciting, but as a horror movie it is very weak. Overall, a very slow and drawn out movie with great acting. I have seen worse though. I give it a B- (because of the acting)
B0068TJLSY|1.0|I wander who's the target audience for this flick. The pickup ramming and destroying a million ton   train. ET running around killing killing everybody. Looks more like a spielburg movie than JJ Abrams.
B004RKXNDU|5.0|Definitely a slow-burn psychological thriller, more than a James Bond gadget-fest where the spy is the dashing fellow who seduces plenty of ladies along the way in the services of HRH the Queen. As per the upcoming film, I was picturing Gary Oldman as George Smiley (despite le Carr&eacute;'s description of Smiley as an overweight, unsexy middle-aged man; Oldman could never NOT be sexy), and enjoyed following him in his quest to unravel the mystery of the mole within the Circus.<br /><br />This is a great spy book because of its decidedly psychological aspects, without psychoanalyzing the characters. While we may never be secret agents living double lives, le Carr&eacute; assumes we've all got secrets of our own, and therefore intrinsically understand the nature of double dealing, on some level. More interesting is the way that these men lead quiet lives of desperation, each struggling with their own versions of official history, particularly after many of them have been thrown out of the service to which they've dedicated their lives.<br /><br />A compelling read, and highly recommended for those interested in the spy/thriller genre. I look forward to reading more of le Carr&eacute;'s work in the future, along with a Graham Greene novel of the same ilk (The Human Factor) recommended to me by a colleague.<br /><br />(As reviewed on GoodReads)

B003Y5H4Y8|1.0|very disappointing movie throughout.  reasons;<br /><br />1. casting.<br />the movie has a dream team cast but failed due to poor casting.<br />the plot calls for casting two actors for the 3 title roles, covering the \\"young\\" period to the \\"old\\" period.<br />however, the actors playing the \\"young\\" role has zero (no, nada, zippo) resemblance to the older roles. indeed, as people age, they can get wrinkles, pot belly, obese... but the general form would still be there.  the movie instead cast Jessica Chastin to play the \\"young\\" role which was played by Helen Mirren in the \\"old\\" role, Sam Worthing to Ciaran Hinds, Martan Csokas to Tom Wilkinson. this is along the same model like the old days when they had white actors and paint their faces black to play black roles or made slant eyes out of white actor to play asian roles. the \\"make believe\\" element is totally absent especially when the plot morphed back and forth from the present time (\\"old\\" roles) to past time (\\"young\\" roles).  exactly for this reason, many viewers complained they had difficult to connect the scenes and who's who as the story switching back and forth from the character's present time to character past time.  this is a movie particularly depends on seamless casting, it failed. movie is about telling a story. when the dots don't connect, you don't tell the story.  a better option would be the Benjamin Butt model, using make up and computer graphics to age the character.  poor casting kills this movie.<br /><br />2. plot.<br />the story is about three Mossad agents tasking to bring a nazi war criminal back to Israel for trial.  after they captured the bad guy, he escaped.  so the agents concocted a lie amongst themselves and told the world that they killed the bad guy. they then returned to Israel to live the lives of hero, adored, admired and worshiped by all.  however, all three were remorseful, experienced great cognitive dissonance feeling they were living a life of lies.  Worthing's character committed suicide by jumping in front of a on coming truck, and the other two hated each other and failed marriage. later in life, by random chance, Helen Mirren's character spotted the bad guy who escaped and after multiple cat and mouse schemes, proceeded to eliminate the bad guy.  the job they failed when they were young finally got done. interesting concept, problem is, it is too SLOW.  this is like a latin american novella where a simple plot takes forever to unravel. if ONLY they made this into an \\"Mission Impossible\\", get the Brothers Yuan to put in kung fu designs, more the EFX. but NO. so the movie degenerated to become a philosophical debate about right/wrong, moral/ethics.  all delivered in darkness, sad, heavy ambiance. end result is a no fun, self important, pseudo thriller movie.<br /><br />i demand my $7 back!!!!nt of a on coming truck, and the other two hated each other and failed marriage. later in life, by random chance, Helen Mirren's character spotted the bad guy who escaped and after multiple cat and mouse schemes, proceeded to eliminate the bad guy.  the job they failed when they were young finally got done. interesting concept, problem is, it is too SLOW.  this is like a latin american novella where a simple plot takes forever to unravel. if ONLY they made this into an \\"Mission Impossible\\", get the Brothers Yuan to put in kung fu designs, more the EFX. but NO. so the movie degenerated to become a philosophical debate about right/wrong, moral/ethics.  all delivered in darkness, sad, heavy ambiance. end result is a no fun, self important, pseudo thriller movie.    i demand my $7 back!!!!

B005JLN9ZI|5.0|Drake seems to have a balance of singing to rapping.  It usually goes sing a little and then rap a alot.  This album is NO different to that balance.  Drake's lyrics sound fresh, original, and something different from your average \\"radio\\" music these days.  The deluxe edition featured 17 of his music.  He also put different musicians with him too.  (Ribhanna, Lil Wayne, Etc...)  Overall, this no different from any other Drake album.  If you hate Drake, this album will NOT change your mind.  If you have always been a fan of Drake, you will love this album.  Recommend it to any Drake fan.
B003K025TQ|5.0|As a long time fan of Lee Ritenour I would have bought this just because of him. The good news here is the Mr. Ritenour has provided a forum for some great players to come together and showcase not only their respective talents but also a great mix of styles. This collaborative effort is reminiscent of the Drum Nation recordings assembled by Modern Drummer magazine in which some of the very best players working today get a chance to strut their stuff. This recording is not only top notch for the quality of the players themselves but a terrific mix of musical styles from blues, jazz, rock and classical. I have been very pleased with this and listen to it often. The important thing to see here is that Lee Ritenour is very respectful and considerate of not only his peers but of the young talent still blossoming in their own careers. Lee is a truly humble gentleman and by far one of the finest players ever to walk this earth. If you buy this you will not be disappointed.

B005NPLXJ4|4.0|Just got my copy of Lulu by Lou Reed and Metallica. I have been a Lou Reed fan for like twenty years and was into Metallica for a little bit too. There are a lot of \\"metallica fans\\" who come on here and just put this release \\"on blast\\" cos they want Metallica to keep making St. Anger or Black Album over and over again, or maybe Ride the Lightning? Lou should'nt have given metallica equal billing because all this fm friendly radio rock metallica fans are getting their underoos all up in a tizzy about this collaboration. First and foremost, this is Lou's album one hundred percent. Metallica are just his backing group (and they do a heck of a job too!). Also, a lot of these know it all amazon reviewers coming on here and giving the one star reviews also claim to know of Lou's music. Well, I doubt those making these claims and simultaneously dismissing this record as a piece of s***e have ever heard more than maybe three songs by LR, so shut yer trap! So far, I like what I hear and give big kudos to both Lou and Metallica for having balls big enough to step out of the \\"formula FM rock\\" sound(ie a la Nickelback, The Fray, Daughtry and whatever top 40 rock radio caca that is deffecated on the fm airwaves these days) on the flip side of the argument,  there are some reasons i revised the rating down from four star to three stars. The main reason for this being that this isn't an album i listen to every day or anything like that. there are a few tracks that just sort of meander and have a hard time maintaining my interest, \\"pumping blood\\" and \\"little dog\\" fit into this category. there are plenty of great songs: the view, iced honey, dragon, junior dad,and frustration~all awesome tracks. there are other lou reed albums that i like more than 'lulu', so a four star rating would be hypocritical if there's lr albums out there which i like better such as Set the Twilight Reeling from 1994, Magic and Loss from 1992, Songs for Drella from 1990, Ecstasy from '98 and my favorite lr live album, Perfect Night from '96. Also, if you do not get this, at least the the song on here called \\"The View\\". killer song.ive album, Perfect Night from '96. Also, if you do not get this, at least the the song on here called \\"The View\\". killer song.

B00464CU7M|5.0|EXCELLENT dvd of the Believe Concert at the O2. Of course, the performer Katherine Jenkins rates 10++ as a mezzo-soprano who is bridging the gap between the classical and pop genres.<br /><br />It doesn't hurt that she is a gorgeous lady as well......
B0034DGPEU|4.0|Killer novel - total page turner. It had me hooked from the beginning, but the ending was literally summed up in less than two short sentences. I feel so robbed!!! I couldn't believe the author chose to end such an amazing work so abruptly. I felt like I had been slapped in the face :( I can only presume the editor/publisher bullied the author into shortening the ending. I sincerely thought someone would find happiness in the end. I couldn't have been more mistaken. Depressing ending. Everyone likes happy endings - heck, give me a bittersweet ending! So disapointed for the characters. I so wanted them to find happiness.

B002AS463W|1.0|I was very disappointed with this release of 9 1/2 Weeks. Just to be clear, ny beef is mainly with the this edition, not with the movie itself.<br />This 2009 release is the same one that was released in 2002. It doesn't add absolutely anything. No extras except for the trailer. The DVD is one of those Double Sided DVD's (single layer) that has a Full-Screen and a Widescreen side (this really sucks as double sided disks are very inconvenient because you have to be extra careful not to scratch the surfaces). Also the transfer is terrible. The image is grainy and dirty. You might as well be watching a VHS.<br />Also, the widescreen version is one of the earlier formats that doesn't even adjust to fit the screen. That means that you are left with a tiny rectangle in the middle of you TV. You can adjust this by zooming in on the image (some TVs as well as DVD players have this option on the remote), but this only exacerbates the grain problem (as you are zooming into a poor image) and the picture looks worse.<br />Very sad to see a good movie get such a poor release after all these years.<br /><br />Languages: English & French<br />Subtitles: Engliish, French, Spanish<br />Extras: Trailer

B005RYF5JA|5.0|I've watched the latest Celtic Woman special \\"Believe\\" the last two nights in a row and actually believe it to be the most entertaining one yet.  I've watched \\"A New Journey\\" and \\"Songs from the Heart\\" probably hundreds of times and, despite that, there are usually some songs that do not appeal to me and I jump over.  I absolutely loved every song from this latest show.  Lisa is spectacular as usual, (I will miss her during her upcoming maternity leave,) Chloe has never been better and the enthusiasm of Lisa Lambe is starting to grow on me, I just love the way she dances around the stage.  What can you say about Mairead other than that she is incredible as usual.  My question is about what they will do with the DVD release?  (Why they cannot release these on blu-ray I do not know.)  On the PBS showing of \\"Songs from the Heart,\\" one of the highlights was Alex Sharpe's \\"You'll Be In My Heart.\\"  When the DVD was released this song was gone and replaced with Alex's \\"True Colors\\" which, while good, was not as good as the other one.  It was even worse with Lynn Hillary's \\"Carolina Rua\\" which was neither on the PBS special or the DVD.  The only place I was able to see it was on the Amazon Celtic Woman store and it was spectacularly enjoyable.  I firmly believe that the cancellation of this song was the beginning of the road for Lynn's departure from Celtic Woman.  (I met her in person at a Celtic Woman appearance and told her how much I enjoyed the song, she seemed genuinely appreciative.)  I see only ten songs listed in the Amazon ad for the DVD.  Is this possible?  There were more songs on the PBS special and I'm sure there were several cut out of that.  I just wish they would rerelease all of the concerts on blu-ray and add back all of the songs taken out.  Anyway I'll buy the DVD when it comes out, not only for the music but the special features. (I can never watch enough of Lisa Kelly.)  But I will keep my copy of the PBS special on DVR as well, just in case.

I now use it with my ipod,  cellphone, and this other mp3 player - better appreciation of your music collection.  Highly recommended for portable use. I also purchased the E9 and E11 (got carried away) for my laptop and it still gives a great performance for my Bose Quiet Comfort15's but I prefer this E11. Better bass!
B002ZG97EC|5.0|I love this movie.  Bought it right after the first time I saw it.  It's my \\"go-to\\" movie for being on in the background when I'm going to sleep.  This is one both I and my fiance really enjoy, and can easily be shown to kids (who won't get many of the \\"adult\\" jokes).<br /><br />Great movie, 100% recommended!

B0001ARCFA|5.0|These are my first pair of AKGs and let me tell you, I'm super impressed. These are by far the most enjoyable headphones to listen to. If you're looking for crazy bumping bass, go somewhere else. These, when properly amped, are incredible, and for 100 bucks, you cant go wrong. The only issue is I have a hard seeing myself using these at school or out of the home. They are quite big, but sound awesome. Very clear, defined bass, mids and trebs are near perfect. My music is very expansive all the way from indie, to dubstep, to big band. These are perfect for me! Definitely  recommend.

B002TVQ4GW|3.0|Triangle is about a group of people going out for a day of sailing, suddenly they are surprised by a storm which leaves them shipwrecked, the group think they are saved when they are picked up by a passing ship, but it turns out they have ended up in a nightmare. On the ship there is no one around and the group soon find itself stalked by a relentless killer. Now first let me say that this sound like the start of another Bermuda triangle movie, but it is the sail boat which is called Triangle, now for all I know the abandoned ship that pick the group up might be in the Bermuda Triangle but this is never mentioned in the movie. What movie is are a time loop movie, it is Groundhog Day with blood and guts and it do a pretty good job at it.<br /><br />The music of this movie is forgettable but fit the film, the actors do a good job but the characters they portray are pretty cookie cutter but they work for the story. Triangle mange to build up an uneasy atmosphere and it do keep the audience guessing about what will happen next. Visually I think this movie is very good and the camera work do the movie credit.<br /><br />The story of Triangle is quite good, in had a very interesting concept and as a time loop story it is well put together. I do however think that at time the phasing of the movie is a bit off, it get boring in some sections and I was left with the feeling of this being a very interesting story but that it was a bit poorly executed.<br /><br />I recommend Triangle, it is a good movie, I would however recommend that you either rent it or wait until you can get it on sale as it is not quite good enough to warrant a full price purchase. There are great movie who are every film lover's treat, and then there are the good but not great movies that keep us going as we wait for the next gem to pass our way, and Triangle is one of those tide you through movies, it is enjoyable but have some issues, still this movie get my recommendation, especially if you like moody time loop story lines.
B005GVW05Q|3.0|I am a huge Ryan Adams fan and have loved everything he has done from JCN to Rock n Roll. What so attracts me to his music is the realness, the starkness, the description of the simple, the heartbreaking facets of life; a life which is hardly ever bubbling with sappy optimism. But this album, as i feared first glancing at the cover, is an unprecedented Ryan Adams. He's happy, optimistic, loving his super-duper wife Mandy Moore, and life is no longer hard. Love has been found. No pain, no sadness. This has resulted in a new man. This album feels so utterly different to me i don't even believe it's the same person. If you've always wanted Ryan Adams to cheer you up and tell you it's all going to be OK, this one's for you. Me? I'm hoping for a divorce and a whiskey and cigarette infused, lovesick follow up. 3 stars because I know it's Ryan Adams by the sound of his voice and he's done too much good in the past for me to totally loose faith.
B005G4TJI4|3.0|First of all this is a bare bones release, there is no extras here, none, not even a trailer, nothing, it is the movie on blu ray and on DVD and that is it. There will be more deluxe releases later so you might want to wait for those if you are interested in special features.<br /><br />Now as for the movie itself it has it's good points and it's bad points. If you have seen the first two films, and you really should do that before watching this one then you already know the premise, a few yeas have passed since Revenge of the Fallen, Optimus Prime and his gang is helping the USA military keep law and order all over the world, a bit of an odd concept for those of us viewers who are not American, and Sam has graduated collage, got a new girlfriend and is trying to get a job while missing the adventures he used to have with his giant robot friends. Things get complicated quickly as it is discovered that Cybertronian artifacts where found on the Moon decades ago during the space race and now both sides of the Transformers want them.<br /><br />Let me start with the good sides to this movie. The special effects are amazing, the robots are more fluid than ever before and fit seamlessly in with the real life actors in the finished product, those that made this movie know their computer graphics. We get to see more of the robots in this movie than the two preceding it, there is still to much focus on Sam and the other human characters but at least now the robots get enough screen time to develop their personalities a bit more. The twins are gone, yes you know the annoying, racist, hillbilly robots from the the second movie, yes they are gone, instead the two small Decepticon turncoats also encountered in Revenge of the Fallen are the new comic relief characters and they are actually funny and allot less annoying than the twins. The storyline in this movie is decent and is actually rather fun to watch.<br /><br />The bad about this movie, well where do I begin, first off all it begins well but after a while the action get ridiculous, there is never a quit moment in this film, even when something is not blowing up and no one is fighting people are screaming, the little turncoats are up to their antics, and generally I found the movie tiering to watch as while I do appreciate some good action, without some quiet moments to digest it all it can get rather tiering and confusing. It is as if Michael Bay where afraid his head would implode if there where not action, screaming and frantic behavior in every single scene of this movie. I also think that many of the characters are under used, especially on the Decepticon side. Also as a life long Transformers fan I am still not to fond of the visual design of the robots and what Bay have chosen to do with the setting. Michael Bay have said that he disliked allot of the original Transformers setting as it shows, generally I think that someone who do not fondly remember Transformers from their childhood would enjoy this movie, and the others in the series, allot more than those of us that do.<br /><br />All in all Transformers Dark of the Moon is a decent film, it have good action, an interesting story and good characters. I think the movie have some rather large flaws, and the lack of special effects on the blu ray set is disappointing but I still recommend this movie, I would however recommend that you wait with buying it until the more deluxe sets is released, and I also recommend that if you are a G1 Transformers fan that you banish the idea of this movie having anything to do with your childhood heroes before you see it, that way you will not ask why Ratchet is candy green, why Soundwave is a sports car and speaks in a warm, animated tone of voice and why Megatron transformers into a rusty lorry that look like it belong on a hillbilly farm.hile the action get ridiculous, there is never a quit moment in this film, even when something is not blowing up and no one is fighting people are screaming, the little turncoats are up to their antics, and generally I found the movie tiering to watch as while I do appreciate some good action, without some quiet moments to digest it all it can get rather tiering and confusing.

B005OGYH90|3.0|I originally purchased this version (2CD/DVD0 thinking it contained the full filmed concert on the DVD that Slash was talking about on his website. Turns out, due to copyright issues with several of the songs featured on the DVD, they could only release the five tracks that are included here. The full DVD and Blu-Ray is available in the UK. I actually ordered the standard single DVD from Amazon UK. In case you're concerned, the disc is NTSC, Region 0, so it should play in most North American players. From what Eagle Entertainment told me, the Blu-Ray should also be Region-free. At least you know the full concert DVD is out there...just not in the format that we expected.
B005K2XM94|5.0|I own other Timbuk2 products and have nothing but good to say about them all, including this one.  Extremely practical and durable - no prissy bells and whistles and they do the job for which they are made remarkably well.  It has a snug fit and has already saved my kindle fire a couple of times.  That is what I purchased it for and that's what it has done.  The color choices are not the most desirable a lot of the times in my opinion, so I always go for the basic black.  You can't go wrong with basic black as far as I am concerned and the gray trim is a nice accent.

1451627289|5.0|This is the first time I have read a Stephen King novel.  The reason for this is that I have never been a fan of horror books and films.  I also have seen some of the movies based on his books like The Shining, Cujo, and Christine and they scared the hell out of me so much that I never wanted to read his books.  However it would have been impossible for me not to read 11/22/63 because of the subject matter.  I grew up in the forties and fifties and was at the University of Michigan in October of 1960 when Kennedy gave his speech about the Peace Corps at one in the morning.  I also worked as a summer student intern in Washington in 1961 and 1962 and went to the White House those two years to hear and see Kennedy.  On the day Kennedy was killed I had just finished my Peace Corps training and was in Detroit getting ready to go to Colombia.  On November 25th the day Kennedy was buried, I was on a plane going from New York to Colombia and saw part of the funeral on television in the Miami Airport.  I have often wished that the world would have stayed like it was before 11/22/63 and am sure that we would have not have had to go through the pain of the Johnson and Nixon Vietnam years.  Stephen King has done a fantastic job of creating a detailed what if scenario, and I can easily put myself in the place of George Amberson and I can imagine myself in the same frame of mind to prevent the greatest disaster of the twentieth century.  The only place I do not agree with Stephen King is when he projects a worse world if Kennedy had lived.  I believe the world would have been infinitely better today if Kennedy had lived.  I believe we would not have dug ourselves deeper into Vietnam but would have gotten out.  I believe the Cold War would have ended sooner and we would not have had the other assassinations, race riots etc. etc.  I think instead that those wasted resources would have been used to improve the situation of the world and that we would now have mankinds first base onthe moon.  In any case, thank you Mr. King for using your skills to give us a tremendous what if book.  I would love it if you would to an additional rewrite of the last part to show us a positive quality world if Kennedy had lived.
0316174483|5.0|This is an amazing book.  My 4-year old daughter had so much fun with it.  She's not a great artist, but she loves arts and craft.  This book boosted her confidence in her ability to create all kind of pictures with just ovals and lines (or finger and paint if you have those handy).
0439023513|4.0|This book will leave you with so many emotions.  Angry, sad, happy, wishing for so many things.  I was a little nervous about reading this book after reading some of the reviews.  I must admit that it was really hard to read.  The first several chapters seem to just be Katniss meandering through District 13 trying to find her purpose again.  When the book does finally pick up the pace, it's a thrilling ride.   The ending is definitely not your typical touch-feely warm fuzzies.  However with the type of series this is, how can anyone expect that Katniss would go back to being the 16-year-old girl she was before she went into the arena?  It's naive to think she wouldn't have scars, both emotional and physical.      I do wish that the author would give us a little more closure on some other characters from the book.  Many of the characters had pretty prominent roles, yet they're left unmentioned at the end.  After spending 3 books getting to know these characters, it's hard to just leave them without knowing their fate.    If you're looking for an easy read leaving you with a happy feeling, this is not the book or series for you.  But if you want a good book which takes a realistic approach to war and how it affects us all, this is a great read.

B000TLMWMY|3.0|I can't say anything about the music, with Bob Dylan and Louis Armstrong and Ray Charles and so many legends... And although I find it equally great to have memories from former Tenessee Two and Kris Kristofferson (yet another legend), I would have appreciate to be able to jump to performances without having the big speeches... Especially when you buy that kind of DVD knowing it will always be near your  player.   It would have been greatly appreciated to have the performances and the banters on differents chapters.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|Updated 12/31/11:  Although I like the case as explained below, I had had some trouble finding something that cleaned the felt on the inside cover.  I have 3 cats, and cat hair as well as just debris was driving me crazy, as felt just loves cat hair.  I have found that ArmorAll Glass Wipes, available at my local grocery store, works well at not only cleaning the kindle fire itself, but the flelt, the rubberized front, and even the elastic.  Not the best on the polycarbonate back, but that doesn't matter to me.  It's cheap too.  Give it a try.  __________________________________________________________________________      I held off buying a cover for my kindle fire because I wasn't sure what I was going to want in a cover and wanted to read other customer reviews.  I had got my kindle fire right off the bat and spent a week with it traveling, and during that time came to know what I wanted in a cover.  I needed a thin, protective cover that did not add any bulk to the device itself.    My wife also got a kindle fire and had gotten the jumi by Marware, and although I like the protection it provides, it is not thin enough for me.  I travel by airlines and I need a really thin cover.  I read the negative review on this cover and had decided this was not for me.  I also read about the rooCase and the Case Logic hard case (reportedly cheaper at Wal-Mart).    I went to Wal-Mart, and they did not have the case for the Fire, but did for the iPad2, but after looking at it for 30 seconds, this was not what I needed either.  Going back to Amazon.com to look again, I found that by now, Marware had added video presentations of their product (which were not initially there) and I got to see this product in action.  That really made a difference for me, as I was having trouble visualizing how that elastic strap worked in my mind.    After seeing the video and re-reading the positive review, I bought one .  It came in one day, and I've had it for one day, so haven't travelled withit yet.  But I agree with the positive reviewer.    For me, it is:       Thin. I have limited room in my computer backpack to place it and want something no larger really that the device is.  This is perfect fitted and adds no bulk.    Protective.  It will prevent scratches and bumps from harming the Fire.    Feels good.  This is a personal requirement for me, and what feels good for others doesn't to me.  I like the feel of a Casio plastic watch over the metal of a more expensive one.  The rubberized feel of this cover has a very nice feel to it to me.      Light.  The product as mentioned weighs maybe 3 oz.  It's very light.    This is just what I was looking for, and it is exactly as advertised.  The hinge for propping I could care less about, and the elastic strap in a nice simple way to close it that works as advertised.  I'm happy with it.   My wife has since said she prefers it over her jumi cover.    The one Con:  It is not the easiest thing to remove the kindle fire from once installed.  EASY to install.  But if you watch the video of the Marware guy trying to remove it, he has a little problem with it too.  I would not want to try to remove the kindle while on a plane, it can be that tight of a deal.  With practice, I'm sure it gets easier, but it is NOT a simple deal.  ON THE OTHER HAND, I don't find myself wanting to remove it.  It looks and feels good in the case, and I want the protection.  The case in no way stops me from using the Fire, so I leave it in all the time.

B004TJ1H3C|5.0|I missed being able to watch this while it was still on air. Being a truck driver, I watched this show when I could. The DVD set has all the episodes of this seaon in one package. Not like the first season where you had to buy them seperately.
B002JCSWV6|5.0|Invictus is an excellent tutorial for anyone encountering bias in the community.  Mr Damon was an excellent star for the portrayal.  Morgan Freeman was excellent as another star of the movie.

B004EPYZSU|4.0|Just about every Friday night, my husband and I have a movie night.  Actually, it would probably be more accurate to say that we have a movie night at least three times a week.  Tonight's movie choice was Cowboys and Aliens.  I remember seeing previews and thought that it looked like a cool film with some pretty good special effects.  I really enjoyed the action, characters and plot.  It was definitely worth seeing.  As far as adding it to my collection, I'm not so sure it's a necessity.

032147404X|5.0|First of all, I have most of the books that Scott Kelby has written on digital photography and Photoshop. They're all first rate, and his books make up a substantial portion of my digital photography library.<br /><br />The Digital Photography Book has hundreds of practical ideas about improving your photography and making it look more professional. The book is organized into eleven chapters, plus an index.<br /><br />The chapter titles are as follows:<br /><br />Chapter One: Pro Tips For Getting Really Sharp Photos<br />Chapter Two: Shooting Flowers Like a Pro<br />Chapter Three: Shooting Weddings Like a Pro<br />Chapter Four: Shooting Landscapes Like a Pro<br />Chapter Five: Shooting Sports Like a Pro<br />Chapter Six: Shooting People Like A Pro<br />Chapter Seven: Avoiding Problems Like a Pro<br />Chapter Eight:  Taking Advantage of Digital Like a Pro<br />Chapter Nine: Taking Travel & City Life Shots Like a Pro<br />Chapter Ten: How to Print Like a Pro and Other Cool Stuff<br />Chapter Eleven: Photo Recipes to Help You Get \\"The Shot\\"<br /><br />In each chapter, Kelby goes over equipment and techniques required for different types of photography. These are not intended to be in-depth coverage of any topic. Chapters average about twenty pages each, giving a brief overview of the topic, followed by some practical tips.<br /><br />The last chapter, \\"Photo Recipes,\\" shows a number of real-world example images, with \\"recipes\\" for getting your own version of the shot. The recipes include elements such as equipment, lenses, lighting (natural and artificial), camera settings, composition, and Photoshop enhancements.<br /><br />The book is a superb resource for amateur photographers who are serious about their photography and want to step up their game. Many other books cover each of the \\"Shooting Like...\\" chapters in much greater depth, but The Digital Photography Book is one of the best books that I've read for taking a vast amount of information and distilling it down and organizing it into a single book of only about two hundred pages.
1250006341|5.0|This book was released in the US earlier this week; I received my copy today and spent a couple of hours this afternoon looking through it. I wanted to review it right away in case anyone is considering buying it as a present for a Downton Abbey fan. It's a beautiful book and one that I'd have been thrilled to get as a gift. It's printed on thick, high quality paper and the photography is stunning. I would note that as Series 2 has not yet aired in the US, if you want to see the show without knowing anything in advance, some of the text is spoilerish here and there. The first instance that I found came at the end of Chapter 2, \\"Society.\\" The photos are from both Series 1 and 2. There are also a number of \\"behind the scenes\\" photos. There are no extensive profiles of or interviews with the principal actors, if you are particularly interested in that, just short (1-2 sentence) snippets, and quotes now and again. There is some history to provide context for the fictional world of Downton (American heiresses marrying into the aristocracy, including Julian Fellow's inspiration for Cora, for example) as well as some information related to the series' production and filming. I did learn things from this that I hadn't heard before, and particularly enjoyed Julian Fellow's stories about ancestors of his who (unknowingly) inspired or gave him ideas for scenes and characters. Fans who have researched and read a lot about the Edwardian era will not likely learn anything new from the text, but I bought the book mainly for the photographs and information about the series, particularly so was not disappointed at all. In summary, I can't imagine any Downton fan not liking this book! The suggestions for further reading are good, though the section on life below stairs could be more extensive. I would second the recommendation of Juliet Gardiner's [[ASIN:1579590829 Manor House: Life in an Edwardian Country House]] (listed as The Edwardian Country House, its UK title) for anyone interested in the era's country house life - likewise very beautifully done.ested in the era's country house life - likewise very beautifully done.

B001R4MEUM|2.0|I debated for almost thirty years, on whether to buy this albaum.  Back in 2009 I decided to buy some \\"early Genesis\\" albaums on CD, since my originals were gone.  After buying Nursery Crime and Foxtrot due to Amazon's great price.  I remembered how much I love those albaums upon hearing them.  So 2 weeks later...Lamb was offered at a great price, most of the reviews were outstanding and I decided thirty years was too long a wait.  Well unfortunately I can not agreed with anyone's reviews.  Yes Title cut and Carpet Crawlers are Genesis classics.  So that is two cuts everyone should know and love.  And Counting out time is good also. But the masterpiece cut..alias long cut for a progressive group \\"In the Cage\\" is a missed.....Gabriel is crying or screeching in pain for the character...makes it hard on your ears, some of the guitar \\"sound effects\\" are noise, and the keyboard work becomed too repetitive and all togreher it is a hard to like.  Since he is \\"teling a story\\"  most of the vocals are NOT sung but just spoken or again screcching out in pain.  All in all again maybe 4 songs are listenable and you will come to love.  Summarize: A concerpt albausm that does not work.  Sorry.. But to be fair Who's \\"Tommy\\" does not work either.  \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" is better. and  \\"The Wall is better\\"  Even Yes's Topagraphic Oceans is better by just a ltttle bit.  As for the story, it apperas must reviewers don't understand it and I also do not.

0312576463|5.0|This one is 5 stars for the simple fact that I really enjoyed it and I didn't expect to. It was obvious that the author intended to make a statement of some sort about the last decade. In my opinion, he didn't do that too well, and I didn't care. I loved the family drama, the angst, all the weird characters - Walter, Patty, the strange family next door with the strange daughter, the brassy mom and the obsession with the great room.  There were so many hilariously witty and wise spot on observations by Franzen that were dropped as asides that I couldn't put it down. Here's one I particularly enjoyed about Patty's favorite son Joey,<br /><br />\\" He was known by his friends to be bizarrely and militantly opposed to masterbation, the mere mention of which never failed to elicit a condescending smile from him, he claimed it was an ambition of his to go through life without resorting to it\\".  Later in the same chapter - \\"From the annoying way he smiled at his schoolmates enthusiasm for Al Gore and Senator Wellstone, as if liberalism were a weakness on a par with self-abuse\\". To me that's funny.<br /><br />I've know people like almost all of the characters in this book and it rang true. It took me through the wringer and ended with some resolution - the mark of a good story. That said - this book got an awful lot of hype, and the arms deal stuff, and the Nature Conservancy politics - booooooring.<br /><br />Overall - I loved this book.
B006INDMEE|3.0|This film has good moments but I just can't get past two key things:  1) You should be over people you fell for in your 20s by the time you're in your 50s.  2) Anybody can beat up an old dude with scissors.  So, watch it if you want but odds are you'll be ambivalent about your experience at best.
B005D0RDIE|4.0|I didn't really need another RUSH concert dvd, as there are plenty to go around, but since we are RUSH fans, we must have it right?  Well, as expected, it is great as usual (except there is no sound unless you have your player on 2.0 stereo for some reason).  I was pleased to hear the whole Moving Pictures, Witchhunt & Camera Eye sounded great. Presto & Time Stand Still were also nice to hear. They played enough odd songs to make you happy.  Otherwise, it is mostly the usual stuff you already have on the other concert DVDs.  But again, we are RUSH fans and love it nonetheless.

B005J6LKVI|4.0|This is a rather captivating, feel-good movie that reveals an ugly part of Southern history albeit not with sublime historical accuracy.  The blu-ray image is excellent as is the sound, although this isn't an action film so don't expect your subwoofers to leap off the floor.  I was troubled by the film's portrayal of Southern women.  While filmdom long ago - and gratefully - set aside the Willie Best/Stepenfetchit stereotypes, it has no problem stereotyping women of the era as empty-headed, evil creatures whose entire life centered around making everyone with black skin feel insignificant.  Stereotyping is wrong; I don't care who the target is.  I do not argue the historical validity of the film's view of the Southern racial system.  Neither do I deny that it existed or even suggest that there was anything good about it.  But I am a descendant of Southerners on my mother's side and actually lived through that era and can tell you that just ain't the way the good old gals behaved back then.  They actually had brains, which no one in this film has other than Skeeter Phelan and, at the end, her mother (who, as an aside, had an awful lot of energy for a women with cancer).  Women of that period weren't the cruel bitches this film portrays, although the real women of the era were themselves locked into a racial caste system that, as individuals, they were powerless to change, nor did they then have any impetus to do so.  I know all you liberals out there will howl \\"racist!\\" and/or \\"insensitive\\" at that comment because the usual liberal knee-jerk reaction is to scream without engaging brain.  Too bad.  It is always difficult to portray a previous era accurately because we naturally view an earlier period of history through a modern lens.  Neither Kathryn Stockett nor director Tate Taylor lived through the period, and they just didn't it quite get those Southern ladies right.
B00005JM02|5.0|I love doing business with Amazon, their process is so easy and you don't have to worry about a screwup on your order.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Wow. Just wow. Where do I begin? It's a good story with characters that I cared about, but it's also a homage to some many things that I enjoyed, either in the past or even still to this day.<br /><br />With some minor exceptions, mainly a lot of the Japanese anime references that I didn't get into much in my youth, I could relate to just about all of the references that the author put in this story. D&D? Video games? Movies? Music? Check to all. It was like taking a time warp to my youth, even though the story takes place 30 years in the future. The fact that these references were an important part of the story made it all the sweeter, particularly the fact that a couple of my favorites were so important to the overall quest.<br /><br />This novel gets 5 stars, but just barely. This review is based on my personal experience with the novel, and the nostalgia trip it put me on, but I have a feeling that there might be a point of dimmishing returns for someone that was born a decade or more before or after the early 70's. I could be wrong, of course, there could be many folks half my age that pick up on these references or at the very least have a desire to get into it.<br /><br />Regardless, I loved this book. Certainly one of my favorites published this year.

B003ZZAXFO|5.0|This album is so full of hidden details it is easy to dismiss it if you are not paying attention. It is readily enjoyable but idiosyncratic at the same time. The drums have no crashes or cymbals. The guitar is played by Fripp but not in his usual sound...sounds as if he is playing an electric outlet more than a guitar. Many chorus voices have the same electrical treatment. The bass is not a bass but a stick played by none other than Tony Levin from King Crimson. The percussions are all exquisitely recorded and include marimba (a favorite of mine) an many other 'strange' ones. And the recording studio is used as an instrument with all it's reverb and other other-wordily effects.  Truly an album that has to be heard to be believed. Gabriel really walks the thin line between avant garde and pop rock with this one. And the 2010 remastering job is an absolute wonder. You will be thinking that your home stereo just got extra vitamins when listening to this. Recommended!
B000WAEK0E|5.0|This is just an incredible collection of Van Morrison songs.  If you're a Van fan you should most definitely have Still On Top. Make sure you get the 3-disc copy.
B004MRB2FO|5.0|I couldn't believe how much I loved this book.  It grabbed me within the first chapter and I was on a 3 day speed read to finish the novel.  I even facebooked the author and waiting impatiently for the sequel. what a must read.
1439152799|5.0|I loved this book so much I just had to show it on my first review ever. I loved the Forgotten Garden and so I kwnew I was not gonna be dissapointed by this other book by Kate Morton, but The Distant Hours has been well beyond my expectations.   I´m not a native english-speaker, so I surely sometimes can´t appreciate how a book is beutifully written, but even though I just loved the way this book is written, the choose of words sounds almost magical, the pace of the story is so enjoyable and engaging ... I just couldn´t put it down, but at the same time I was trying to read it slowly, to savour every chapter so the book will last.   Many things reminded me of The Forgotten Garden while reading The Distant Hours: The plot and the way the story is told going back and forth on time, the way there is a main voice telling the story (a young woman with a difficult relation to her mother, ...), how different characters lead the narration sometimes, the aim being to unravel a mistery from a loved-one´s past.   As other people have already said, this a perfect book for reading by the fire, while raining outside. Take it on a holiday to some cold place and you will love it, or read it at home... you will love it anyway!.
B004LROMSO|1.0|I really anticipated watching this show and remained hopeful through the first few episodes.  However, after about five episodes I stopped watching it and would have rather watched the nature channel.  Pretty much everything is poorly done - the writing, the plot/direction of the show, and the acting which all come off as cheesy and sloppy.  In my opinion it was hard to make this show \\"not\\" work because who doesn't want to watch a show about Camelot, but somehow they managed to do that.  There are other good shows during this period like \\"Pillars of the Earth\\" and \\"Game of thrones\\" worthy of your time...
B0032FPVKE|5.0|I recently purchase a camcorder for my father and this was a perfect bag for it. Sometimes when I borrow it I put my camera inside and it holds up nicely. There are many pockets for chargers and cords and they have turned out to be very useful. The inside is so soft that it really makes me feel like my camcorder/camera is safe inside. I was definitely impressed with the quality of the bag since it was so cheap compared to other products I was looking at. If I ever have to buy a new bag I will definitely buy this one again.
B004ZN9W5M|4.0|Just wanted to add to the other reviews that this SOUNDS GREAT!! If you are looking for a great remastered version of this album (as i was) this is it! I admit i have not heard the past digitized ones as i only had the vinyl version previous to this cd but it sounds just amazing. i don't think you can improve any more (unless you go with Audio dvd or Blue ray). Of course, the music is great from the last classic Pink Floyd formation.
B004SD5GZ4|3.0|like another reviewer said, the fire already supports Pdt and seems to work fine. i downloaded this hoping that i would be able to &quot;unlock&quot; my password protected college text. unfortunately this was not the case. it gets 3 stars until adobe adds that feature in.

0307959856|4.0|Having been a Jane Austen and P.D. James fan for more years than I care to admit, the news that Ms James had written a Pride & Prejudice sequel brought mixed emotions--would this prove to be a wonder of the \\"you got your chocolate into my peanut butter\\" caliber or another of the low quality sequels so many lesser known authors had produced previously?  Reader reviews, the source that usually aids my final purchase decisions, were mixed in this first week after publication--with the evaluations generally tending to the extremes.  No matter.  I yielded to what was basically a desire to see the future Ms James had created for my old friends, and bought the book.  I enjoyed this sequel very much; couldn't refrain from tearing right through it, but still wanting it not to end.  Another reader pointed out that this sequel contains bits of information inconsistent with the original, but I found these to be minimal and not of sufficient nature to interfere with overall enjoyment of the new novel.  Reading this was a return to old friends, and I was eager to see what changes had occurred while I'd been away.  There was an acknowledgement of the political changes ongoing in England, but true to the spirit of the original, the plot and focus are confined to the matters ongoing with our main people.  It was fun seeing how characters had evolved as well as how they hadn't:  Initially, Lydia's attitude and expressions surprised me, but after thinking it over, I found them to be consistent with the original Lydia.  I also enjoyed the allusions to Persuasion and Emma.  Additional detail might be plot-spoiling, but I was impressed with insights Ms James had drawn from the original novel with regard to character interaction and how she used them to bring new levels of meaning to the sequel.    Like most people, I have to watch my budget; even with Kindle pricing's reduction from the standard hardback price, this was a lot for me to spend on a single book.  I bring this up only because I want to add that it was worth it.  Like the original on which it's based, this book is one I'll want to read again.  Thank you, P. D. James, for giving us the best Pride and Prejudice sequel to date.
B004LWZW7Y|4.0|This movie is a fun mix of various fairy tale references and the Zorre-esque Puss In Boots character from the Shrek films.  We basically get here the origins of the Puss character and an early adventure of his.  It has the general fun and atmosphere of the Shrek movies while having its own identity - it's full of lots of humor, but with a good adventure story to keep the plot moving.    There are several things that this movie could've totally blown but got spot-on right.  The creators made the right move in focusing on one character from the Shrek movies in his own feature, and they definitely made the right choice of characters - Puss is likeable and amusing and has enough substance to pull of the lead role.  As a music lover, I was particularly pleased with the flamenco-ish soundtrack (featuring Rodrigo & Gabriela) that added to the overal cultural flavor, as opposed to the modern pop music of Shrek.  Similarly, the \\"Zorro\\" similarities with the title character was matched with a Mexican setting and appropriate accents (except by the annoying  American accent of Humpty Dumpty, which dind't fit in at all, and I don't remember any explanation in the movie of why someone raised from a small child in an orphanage would not have the same accent as those he grew up around).  The movie didn't try to fit in innapropriate references to characters that didn't belong (as in, for example, \\"Muppet Babies\\", where a bunch of characters we'd seen meet for the first time as adults are now seen hanging out as children).  So, you won't see Shrek or Donkey, but Puss does just fine on his own (and the movie maybe flows a little better without the increasingly over-the-top slapstick of the later Shrek films).  In fact, this movie definitely has a different feel than Shrek, with a little less of a focus on mixing modern pop-culture references with a fantasy setting, although those elements are still there.    Definitely worth watching and I hope it spawns a series of films of its own.
B005PTQPU0|5.0|Initially, I purchased four songs, based solely on the free previews.  I eventually downloaded the entire album.  Personally, I'm not a fan of Wild Man or Lake Tahoe, but it was worth it for Misty.  And the duet with what's-his-name.  And piano work and song structure that reminds me of Janis Ian, and vocals much more matured than you're probably expecting.  If you're a Kate Bush fan, this album is worth it.
B000JML7YC|2.0|I've been working on reading all of Ms. Austen's oeuvre, and all I have left is Persuasion. Reading Northanger Abbey was a miserable experience. The heroine is so insipid, and I could care less about the parody of the gothic novel. I'm reading Austen for her character-building abilities, not for her making fun of old novels I haven't read.   The other characters were abominable too--Mr. and Ms. Thorpe, the Allens, the whole lot of them, Catherine as a child. And I thought for so long that the widower General was hitting on Catherine himself.   I even had to listen to the audio version to try and move things along but it still made me grit my teeth and at times bored me to the end of my nerves.  Well, if you only have one Austen to skip, skip this one. Or read it only if you're a diehard fan, which I am not.
B004G7FFF8|5.0|The reviews of this I read, one in particular, do a great job of describing what's in the set and how it's arranged.  I will only add that the discs are in color-coded light carboard envelopes that correspond to colors on the box, a color for each \\"kind\\" of music (eg Schubert transcriptions, opera transcriptions, Beehoven).  This is very nice.  I'm listening to it now, and it is wonderfully played, and (needless to say) things you just won't hear played anywhere else, plus of course things you hear played constantly.  Played beautifully.  Have heard nearly all of them at least once now.  Ones that I wanted to hear, that is.  Can't imagine Cziffra, Hamelin, Wild, Ashkenazy, anyone playing them better.  A suggestion.  I spent a night and a day and recorded these CDs (all that I wanted of them - no orchestras, no Wagner, had already bought some singly before this set came out) onto CD-Rs and have them now in plastic jewel cases. These are the ones I play.  This set is too nice to wear out the cardboard sleeves or risk damaging an original CD.  Plus the CDs are simply easier to get to when they're in jewel cases.   Howard is apparently a brilliant musicologist. In the section of new discoveries, fragments - things like that - there are many notes of his putting things together and making them playable.  Some time ago I bought Cziffra's boxed set of EMI recordings (40 discs).  The Liszt is every bit as wonderful.  (Transferred those CDs to CD-Rs and plastic jewel cases too.)

B004ZBFRTY|5.0|I picked this up on Blu-ray as I felt I needed to replace my old DVD.  If you have not seen this before I really don't know why you would be reading this or even looking at this movie.  However, if that is the case, I have to say you will have one of two reactions; this is one of the best movies of the last 20 years or these people are nuts and it should have gone (and basically did) straight to DVD.    I fall in the first camp though I know that the film has weaknesses.  I know it had some cheap corners cut, that some of the otherwise strong actors (Drew I mean you) were just off, but something about it just works.  And no, I won't pull the ultimate prententious statement and say that anyone who dislikes it \\"just must not get it\\", it is a little complex but it is no Momento.  You do need to carefully watch some parts to see how it all fits together and at the end, you will be faces with putting the pieces in back, but it is not crazy complex.  Perhaps it is the music...as a child of the 80's it was spot on.  Maybe it was the perfect casting...everyone of the younger actors shines.  And maybe I just got caught up in Sparkle Nation (sorry you'll have to see it if that does not register).  Overall, somehow, this crazy cheap, oddball movie is firmly in my top 10 of all time and I just can't explain it.

B003Y5H5AG|1.0|Throwbacks to bygone eras are nothing new in Hollywood, and for the past few years, it seems the 1980s have been the decade of choice to reference and mimic, with '80s themes appearing in both live action and animated fare. Enter The Smurfs, based on those lovable little blue creatures who kept children entertained for years on Saturday mornings. In this film adaptation, a handful of Smurfs are chased through a portal by the evil wizard Gargamel, only to end up in the real world of Manhattan. There, they befriend a sympathetic couple who help them find a way back home. I found almost nothing to like about the movie, which makes sense on some level: The Smurfs was clearly crafted to appeal to the lowest common denominator, and by \\"lowest\\" I mean \\"shortest\\"... you know, kids. With broad, slapsticky humor and \\"Smurf\\"-heavy dialogue, this movie probably won't do anything for you if you're over the age of 5, but if you want your little ones to learn in the simplest way what \\"Greedy\\" and \\"Vain\\" mean, you could possibly do worse.

0439023521|5.0|i think my title explains it all. the words take you in and you are hungry for more. you can see the world of panem throught katniss eyes and see how ugly it is.
B004QZ9PLU|4.0|I really liked this book. I know some say it was predictable, but I disagree.  It had me guessing and making predictions the entire book, up until the end when I started to piece together what may happen. I would recommend reading this if you like Nicholas Sparks.
0307891372|5.0|Originally posted negative review (which didn't post) but after using this book for a month while playing Skyrim I have to say it's INVALUABLE! MUST HAVE if you play the game!!! Saves time, frustration, and that aimless running around looking for stuff typical with RPG's - It's like GPS for Skyrim. How can you put a price on time and overall game enjoyment? This is priceless. The guide has helped me prepare to solve various quests - I read it before doing any quest. It has tips for enchanting armor and weapons, recipes for food, beast and human rankings. Locations to mines for ore to make and improve weapons and armor. Where to find people for quests, maps and detailed info for the stages and locations,  including where to find all special weapons and collectable items. Pre-reqs for various quests. Had Skyrim about a month and I'm about 115 hours into it. Level 32, Redguard Battlemage. Finishing up the Thieves guild quests. Just handily defeated Mercer Frey (didn't die once using the Fireball staff and Staff of Gaulderson) and obtained the Skeleton Key. Now I can pick ANY lock in Skyrim. Figured I use the key first to solve ALL 20 Thieves guild Radiant Quests then return it to the Nightingales to finally take my rightful place as a Thieves Guild Master. Made over 30,000 gold doing just the Thieves Guild Quests with the help of this book. Not sure what quests to do after - Daedric, Companions, Dark Brotherhood, Dragon - so many choices! My only gripe - NO TIPS AT ALL FOR DEFEATING CERTAIN HIGH RANKING BOSSES. That's a real bummer as have to do the trial and error method to beat certain enemies. Overall AWESOME GUIDE! If you play the game - GET THE BOOK!
B005KJZDXK|3.0|Purchased this because I really love Zoe but the him part does not add anything to the music and I'm not real thrilled with their rendition of \\"Baby, It's Cold Outside\\" which is the main reason for my purchase - Zoe sings the male part??? I hope she makes a solo Christmas album some day.
B005LZW8FO|2.0|You probably won't be in the middle on Another Earth; either you'll find it to be a hypnotic meditation on fate and circumstance or a pretentious, self-serious snoozer. Regardless, few would call it conventional. It's the tale of an aspiring astrophysicist whose carelessness changes the life of a brilliant composer forever; now that a new planet exactly like ours has been discovered, can our heroine get a second chance to make everything right? Brit Marling stars and co-wrote the screenplay for Another Earth, and the film offers proof of her unique talent -- just don't expect a typical sci-fi story.
0452295548|4.0|This book was easy to understand and insightful.  I had an AVM once but it did not rupture.  Until I read this book I had no idea how lucky I was.  My AVM was taken care of with gamma knife radiation.  Anyone having symptoms described in this book should see a dr. or call for help immediately.
B0036TGT3E|5.0|I remember when The Lion King first came out, I was in Kindergarten and I went to the drive-in with my family to see it.  I loved how fun it was, but didn't yet realize how emotional it was.  Now that we got it on Blu-Ray for the 20th anniversary, I really appreciate the production as a whole.  The music, the characters, the emotions, friendship, pride, etc.  Everything about this movie is top-notch.  Now, my two kids enjoy it too.  Maybe one day, they'll enjoy it as much as me.  :)  Also, I got this delivery WAY sooner than I expected.  I ordered a CD from someone else online 3 weeks before I ordered The Lion King and I got The Lion King a week before the CD.  Very pleased with delivery.  5 Stars for Delivery, 4 stars for the movie.
B000AJIF4E|3.0|As a college student that doesn't particularly care for other students, my headphones are my best friend. Since Christmas 2010, when I got them as a gift, there has not been a day where I did not use my headphones. The bass was well balanced, the volume levels were moderate, and I took great care of my favorite headphones. Very comfortable, great sound, easily stored, portable, and now unfortunately unreliable. Sadly, about two weeks ago, the left ear buzzed, and there's been no sound in it since them. The right ear is fine, but it's kind of weird listening to music in studio headphones with only one ear. I'm hoping I just got a lemon and need to purchase more. Not everyone has the money to buy Beats headphones; frankly, for the money, these are better quality anyway (Beats plastic material is easily breakable). I'd recommend this product to anyone, but with caution...

B004UXUUDA|3.0|The first thing one might be inclined to say about Sarah's Key after hearing its premise is, \\"Oh, another Holocaust movie?\\" While this is true, I will tell you that this one is certainly worth watching. Somewhat of a two-part film, the first half of Sarah's Key focuses on the titular Sarah, a young Jewish girl living in France who falls victim to the Vel' d'Hiv Roundup in 1942, wherein French police in German-occupied Paris rounded up Jewish families to be shipped off to Auschwitz; Sarah is able to escape, but not in time to save her little brother, and this haunts her until her death as an adult. In the present day, an American journalist learns that her French husband has inherited the same apartment where young Sarah once lived, and she begins an investigation into the apartment's past that uncovers Sarah's history. I found the film absorbing and impeccably acted all around, even if it had a few minor plot issues. Sarah's Key may not be the definitive Holocaust film, but it's one that will engage you until the credits roll.
0439813786|5.0|This book is visually spectacular.  I bought it for my son who is studying art.  The story is wonderful as well.  Suitable for non-readers since the picutres tell the story.

1451627289|5.0|This is the first Stephen King book I have read in over 20 years and I am not sure why I waited so long.........This book is great. I have read at least a dozen of his books back when I was in High School/ College. 11/22/63 has all of Stephen King's twisted passions and talents......and great fun with time travel and \\"butterfly effect\\". Do not miss this one.
B005NQ94KS|1.0|Blossoming superstar Anne Hathaway put on her sometimes iffy British accent once again for this romantic drama based on one of my favorite recent novels of the same name. The film follows friends Emma and Dexter over the course of 20 years, beginning with the day they meet and checking in on the same date every year. As the years pass, the pair naturally come to realize they may have been perfect for each other all along. Despite a solid cast, good source material to draw from, some interesting narrative elements, and the fact that director Lone Scherfig's last effort was the multiple Oscar-nominated An Education, One Day failed to resonate with me. I simply felt the film lacked the emotion, depth, and insight that made the book such a hit. This is a risky venture, possibly suitable only for the most diehard of romantics.
B0051QK87S|5.0|First, let me start off by saying that I'm a metal guy (I've played drums in metal bands for years). Never been into pop until I saw Gaga's Bad Romance video a few years back. It was the first time I thought of a pop song as a true artistic vision. I've been a Gaga fan ever since. With the release of Born This Way, I think Gaga has really shown true growth as an artist, pushing new boundries in artistic expression and really just being herself. For me, metal has always been about being rebellious, doing your own thing, and having your own artistic views. I've come to realize that Gaga is pops metal equivalent, and I love her for it. Paws up!
B000ELJBAK|5.0|This album has some really great songs. Gilmour's voice is amazing because he was so young when this album as recorded. This is a must have album for any pink Floyd fan.
B001HNE3NO|4.0|I bought both the book and the DVD on the same day. I just fnished reading the book and am sad that the story is over. It was done in such a wonderful way that the reader does not get at all lost between Cultures and Timelines. The flow between history and present was both fluid and traveling. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because, as with many books, I find myself wishing the Author would get to the point and skip a few sentences here and there, as if it were being \\"over\\" explained. And then there were areas where I felt as if the author herself was getting bored with \\"this part,\\" and moved on too quickly, leaving me feeling as if there were something missing. (Perhaps a bit of Reader's ADHD?..LOL!) I loved the story. I could see, feel, and smell the air of every Counrty and State she would describe. It had me wishing that my own Mother was still around to ask her if she heard or knew anything about this History.  I was disappointed to read the reviews of her 2 books that followed \\"Sarah's Key\\", but as with all things, I will still have to find out for myself. A read I highly recommend.
0743297334|4.0|fantastic book if you are an 'active participant'.<br /><br />Aside from a great portrait of the lost generation I think that Ernest Hemingway did a great job in exploring concepts such as life, love, nature, frienship and masculinity. So if you are an 'active participant' you will love this book.
B005HI4LMS|4.0|Horror-comedies are difficult to pull off effectively; these days, the go-to example of a good one is Shaun of the Dead, which was constantly hilarious, but also managed to get in a few decent thrills. As it turns out, Tucker & Dale vs. Evil does a pretty darn good job of it too. Accomplished character actor Alan Tudyk and Tyler Labine are Tucker and Dale, respectively, a couple of everyday hillbillies who are on vacation in the woods. When they rescue an attractive teen from drowning and take her back to their cabin to nurse her back to health, her group of friends believe they've kidnapped her for nefarious purposes, and a hilarious tragedy of misunderstandings ensues. I found Tucker & Dale an effective mix of scares, laughs, and heart, and though the movie's central joke is replayed to death, I say it actually works. Tucker & Dale has actually been available through On Demand for a while now, but if you want a physical copy, now's the time to pick one up.
B000803PKY|5.0|This is the album that was my introduction to Jackson Browne back in 1977 and listening to it now in beautifully mixed  5.1 surround I am hearing details in the music I had never noticed before.This is a live album though some of it was recorded in non conventional settings like on a tour bus or backstage but every song fits together so seamlessly that even those who don't like live recordings would have no problems here.  Other reviewers have covered the finer details so for those that are wondering whether it is worth getting this DVD Audio version I can only say yes do it while it is still available.For me it is a huge improvement on the standard  stereo mix in not only musical detail but also in how `big' it sounds.It really is an immersive experience.
B0019HQIFE|5.0|Wasn't a john Mayer before..but I saw this performance in a home theater store..ordered it and became a big fan. This blueray has a long list of songs, he performs with his band and solo.  The recording quality is absolutely amazing allows you to set stereo or 5.1 Dolby.

B005HP2J66|5.0|The Chauvet-Pont-d'Arc Cave in southern France contains the oldest known cave paintings -- works of remarkable beauty and detail that are all the more amazing for being more than 30,000 years old. Since access to the cave is highly restricted, Werner Herzog's Cave of Forgotten Dreams 3D is the next best thing to being there, and what a delightful, awe-inspiring tour it is. The 3D is used to terrific effect here -- you can practically smell the dankness of the caves, and you'll constantly feel the urge to duck stalactites -- and the paintings are gobsmackingly beautiful and haunting -- \\"the birth of the modern human soul,\\" as Herzog describes it. If you don't have a 3D TV, the Cave Blu-ray/3D Blu-ray combo still allows you to check out the movie, but be aware: this is one movie that really does look better in all three dimensions.

0517548232|5.0|This is not a new book;perhaps that's why it is so useful.  There is no gobblygook, no arcane economic theories with fancy lables.  What there are in this book are many examples of - - if the government takes this action to make this or that happen, the unintended consequences have proven to be and will probably be again something quite different, and usually not positive.    Sound experiential economics in my view, clearly written; and a tremendous help to understanding what will probably happen if the nation takes on more debt, subsidizes this or that interest, taxes one interest at the expense of another, etc.   I liked it; I could read and understand it.

B004EPZ0BG|3.0|Some fuss was made earlier this year when the two stars of Darren Aronofsky's acclaimed Black Swan separately appeared in two films with identical themes and equally obvious titles: first, Natalie Portman starred in No Strings Attached, and a few months later, Mila Kunis starred in Friends with Benefits. Both explored the inevitable complications that arise in sex-only relationships, but while the former was not very good, Friends with Benefits impressed me to the tune of 3 stars. Here, Kunis plays a corporate headhunter who recruits a hotshot art director from California for a job at GQ magazine in New York. The two immediately hit it off and agree to engage in a no-strings-attached relationship of pure sex until they begin to realize they're both falling for each other. So what made this film so much better than the Natalie Portman flick? The chemistry between Kunis and Timberlake is natural and immensely effective, almost carrying the movie by itself. You won't find anything new to the rom-com formula here, but it sort of works anyway.
B001UV4XIS|4.0|I am an avid Harry Potter fan and I love the books.  But this final movie, while quite good and will be watched over and over again just like the others, is so dark that it's hard to see.  I was disappointed.
0545265355|1.0|THERE IS NO HAPPY ENDING! PLEASE, PLEASE, SAVE YOURSELF FROM A HORRIFIC EVIL SADISTIC STORY THAT WILL LEAVE YOU FEELING LIKE THE WORLD IS AN EVIL PLACE AND WE ARE ALL GONE DIE HORRIBLE DEATHS!!  Please do not read these horrifying books!  The first book sucks you into thinking this will be a great series but they are not.   This sadistic woman(who needs to be locked up in a mental institution) destroys everyone and everything with pathetic reasoning after thought notations.   You think all the people in these books are dying to protect this main character and they are brave and their sacrifice will save the day. Get that thought out of your head now none of them die for a good cause they all die in vain.  Here is a brief description of her happy ending.   Everyone the main character loves is dead or has become evil. But the main character lives happily ever after half her body burnt to a crisp, with the man of her last option, while the people she fought for hate her but its okay cause the children she never wanted melt her heart in the last paragraph. Her kids don't even have a name. Oh and in the last chapter just to throw another nail in your heart she makes sure you know the only person the main character wasn't sure lived or died is found dead. No really reason for the added death didn't move the story along at all. Just a quick, \\"ohh by the way shes dead.\\"    Katniss is not a martyr to be thankful for she was a pawn that everyone used to greedily get what they want in a world that really didn't change.  WHAT KIND OF A SCREWED UP STORY IS THIS!!!!  This book made me hope Suzanne Collins dies before she can infect more anguish and hatefulness into the world.
B005CMSDKA|3.0|Honestly, the best scenes in the movie are in the trailers.  I found the story pretty dull the rest of the time, and the story only implies what happens to the family that Hanna befriends along the way.  Further, for the so-called genetic engineering of a soldier, she's remarkably bad at handling bad people.
B004EPZ06G|1.0|Back in 2009, Warner Bros. had a surprise hit with the raucous bromantic comedy The Hangover, and it was immediately expected that a sequel would follow. Sure enough, two years later, audiences were treated to a second outing with the \\"Wolf Pack,\\" namely Phil, Stu, Alan, and Doug. If you've heard or read anything about the movie, you know that the typical summary offered is \\"It's pretty much the same as the first one, except that it takes place in Thailand.\\" This time around, it's Stu who's getting married, so the gang travels back to his fiancee's homeland for the festivities, and again, it's Alan who inadvertently brings about another forgotten night of mayhem that the fellas must piece together the day after. What the first movie had going for it -- namely, the element of surprise and a sense of joyful mayhem -- is largely missing from this sequel, which sports raunchier jokes and a much darker tone. If you don't mind a sense of déjà vu, feel free to dive right in.
0321704452|4.0|This book is a great book and very entertaining. If you stop taking yourself so seriously, you present better. That's basically what this book talks about. The normal cliché is to imagine the audience in the underwear to make you as the presenterfeel more comfortable, but this book explains a different approach. The author says for the presenter to become naked. Not literally but figuratively. Getting naked, as a presenter. just means to become transparent and to deliver your message in more of a conversational manner than in an uptight presentation manner. The book explains that if you have transform presentations into honest free flowing of ideas discussions you must remove all barriers and become genuine with the audience. This is a good book for beginning presenters as well as vets for a different perspective.
B005AUWXZ0|5.0|I thought the premise was very clever and the cars were terrific.  I am an adult but I enjoyed this movie immensely and thought the animation and the story were wonderful.  Children will find the cars and the story entertaining as well.  A nice family film.

B004EPYZPS|4.0|J.J. Abrams has been known to keep his projects super secret, whether it was a major plot point in his hit television show LOST or the unveiling of the monster in Cloverfield, which he produced. It was no different with his latest directorial effort, Super 8; the first trailer released thrillingly depicted a collision between a pickup truck and a freight train carrying something ominously powerful, but not much else. As it turned out, the film follows a group of kids making a home movie with a super 8 camera who happen to be present when the aforementioned collision takes place, and their camera inadvertently captures something they never expected to film. When strange things begin occurring in town, the children take it upon themselves to solve the mystery. Super 8 is an earnest throwback to the kid-friendly sci-fi adventures of the 1980s, and with Steven Spielberg producing, it's no wonder. With plenty of thrills, visual dazzle, and emotional depth, Super 8 a pretty good choice if you're looking for some good, old-fashioned, nostalgic fun.
B0063IH60K|3.0|The game itself is great. But every time you deal the cards to start a new game you get a pop up ad for other aps. I don't mind ads at the bottom if the screen or while loading, but pop up in an ap are just too far.

B004EPYZT4|1.0|It's been almost three decades since the last big screen portrayal of Robert E. Howard's Conan the Barbarian, and most will remember that he was famously played by Arnold Schwarzenegger. How, then, would a remake fare, with a new story and a new Conan? Not very well, actually. This time around, Jason Momoa plays the titular warrior, who is born in the heat of battle and trained as a warrior until his entire family is slaughtered by an evil warlord named Khalar Zym in search of pieces to a mystical mask. Conan escapes the onslaught and lives on as a pirate until a chance meeting provides him with a new lead to seek vengeance for his clan's extermination. Co-starring Rose Mcgowan, Rachel Nichols, and Ron Perlman in small role as Conan's father, Conan the Barbarian failed to impress. I felt the film lacked any good characterization, worthy dialogue, or competent acting. It's gory and over the top, so if you're looking for a mindless action flick with those credentials, have at it; if you're looking for anything more, search elsewhere.
B003L77GH4|5.0|I am a huge fan of the show, but I especially loved Season's 2 \\"Year of Kat\\". Katherine is the best villain yet. She is devious, scheming, selfish, and has no compulsions about breaking some eggs to make omelette. Yet Katherine is such a delicious villain that you love to hate her and want to keep her around nevertheless. You sometimes forget that the same actress is playing Elena. I also grew much more attached to characters that I had simply assigned to as backround plotlines. The Caroline scenes sometimes steal the entire episode and we get new faces with the werewolves (like Mason! *swoon*). I absolutely recommend this show, especially this season. I bought this during the black friday week bonanza and got a price that that left me and my bank account gleeful. Amazon is the place to order especially during their specials. The only reservations I hold regarding this set is about the extras. There's not much of them. I would have loved an extended blooper reel. Season 1's blooper reel was significatly longer.   Happy Shopping. :)

B004EPYZSK|1.0|Tell anyone you've got an alien invasion movie set in the old west, starring Harrison Ford, Daniel Craig, and Olivia Wilde, and directed by Jon Favreau, and chances are that you'll have the listener's full attention. Too bad, then, that the actual film this describes turned out to be a flop. Based on the graphic novel of the same name, Cowboys & Aliens is exactly the kind of genre mash-up that contemporary audiences eat up heartily; 007 himself plays a wandering stranger with no memory who stumbles into the New Mexico town of Absolution, only to find that the town's residents don't take too kindly to strangers. However, when a mysterious otherworldly menace begins an assault on the town, the stranger must team up with the local lawman to battle for humankind's survival. So what was the major problem here? I felt that, despite appealing performances from Craig and Ford, the film simply shifted its tone too abruptly and too often, never quite settling into a comfortable and effective groove. Cowboys & Aliens isn't the awesome genre action flick it could have been, but it may still satisfy those in dire need of a fix.

B004A8ZWVK|4.0|What seemed on its surface to be another schmaltzy, pandering examination of race relations turned out to be one of the surprise hits of the year, thanks mostly to the efforts of its terrific cast. Based on the novel of the same name by Kathryn Stockett, The Help stars Emma Stone as Eugenia \\"Skeeter\\" Phelan, an intrepid young journalist during Civil Rights era America who decides to write a surely controversial novel about the experiences of black maids from the maids' perspectives. During the course of her interviews, Skeeter befriends her subjects and an unlikely bond develops, lending Skeeter's project a new sense of import and purpose. Though I felt the film somewhat glossed over its racial themes, the power of the performances, including superb turns by co-stars Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer, helped to elevate the picture to 3 stars. The Help may not quite be the grand lesson in race relations some might want it to be, but it's a moving look at the era and a worthy adaptation of its source material.

B005OOSPZO|3.0|A troubled production and a flop at the box office, Tora! Tora! Tora! certainly can't count lack of ambition as one of its faults. A history lesson come to life, the film dramatized the attack on Pearl Harbor from both the American and Japanese perspectives; while I like its commitment to historical accuracy, I feel the film lacked dramatic heft. The American scenes were directed by Hollywood pro Richard Fleischer, but it was the Japanese scenes that caused headaches for the producers; originally, Akira Kurosawa was to direct, but he backed out, only to be replaced by action director Toshio Masuda and future Battle Royale helmer Kinji Fukasaku. With a cast that includes Martin Balsam, Joseph Cotten, and Jason Robards, as well as Kurosawa and Ozu players So Yamamura and Eijiro Tono, the new Tora! Tora! Tora! Blu-ray is a great stocking stuffer for military buffs on your holiday shopping list.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|Having read Kathryn Stockett's [[ASIN:0399157913 The Help Deluxe Edition]] first I was concerned that I had a made a terrible mistake, as the movie could how vivid the book had become to me while reading it.  The characters Stockett creates were so alive and so true to the era that I was convinced Hollywood would interfere or meddle with the world that Stockett creates, but the movie instead hews quite faithfully to the book, retaining all of its resonance and emotional punch.  That's truly a rarity in movie adaptations and what gives \\"The Help\\" its punch is the stellar ensemble cast as much as the taut screenplay.  The plot should be fairly well known by now; an aspiring author (Skeeter Phelan, played pluckily by Emma Stone) determines to chronicle life from the perspective of American-American maids in the Kennedy-era Jim Crow South.  The maids (led by Abileen Clark, played to stoic perfection by Viola Davis) are understandably skeptical of this interloper and the potential danger cooperating with her endeavor brings. As the movie unfolds it gives viewers a sense of the tensions of that era as Jim Crow was slowly being beaten down and the nascent Civil Rights movement was taking form. Usually filmmakers' approaches to this era aren't well done, lacking in nuance and depth but that isn't the case here as \\"The Help\\" accurately captures the dynamics in both the black and white communities and between the two in a fundamentally honest and accurate way. And while there is understandable tension in the movie it is leavened by the performances of Alison Janey (as Skeeter's mother) and Octavia Spencer (in an Oscar worthy role as the outspoken, scene stealing Minny Jackson).<br /><br />There are obvious concerns about a movie touching on this era devolving into minstrelry or perpetuating tired stereotypes and thankfully \\"The Help\\" avoids those traps. Some may worry that it plays into the trope that only white people could \\"save\\" African-Americans in this era, but the truth is both were working together to the same goal and \\"The Help\\", like [[ASIN:B00008W2RD The Long Walk Home]] and wonderful PBS series \\"I'll Fly Away\\" hint at that.  Indeed, \\"The Help\\" follows in the same vein as both of those and the truly phenomenal [[ASIN:B0031WNYHK Eyes on The Prize: America's Civil Rights Years 1954-1965]] series.  More than anything I came away touched by the bravery and courage that each individual must have possessed during that era if they believed in social justice and racial equality.  It was not an easy path to take, and looking at those who opposed it now one can only laugh at how narrow minded they were.  But it was no laughing matter at the time.  No one then could have known the outcome and many lives and careers were destroyed for being outspoken on either side.  Ultimately \\"The Help\\" is a glimpse into our nation's soul, where we were as a people, and how far we've come.  That is ultimately validating and life affirming that we are on the path to becoming a better people and a better nation.ere working together to the same goal and \\"The Help\\", like [[ASIN:B00008W2RD The Long Walk Home]] and wonderful PBS series \\"I'll Fly Away\\" hint at that.

B003JTHWJQ|5.0|I was blown away many years ago when I read The Selfish Gene and have read just about everything Richard Dawkins has written since then.  What a brilliant mind and what a wonderful writer.  Makes one feel quite inadequate.

B003Y5H4Y8|3.0|Have room for one more unoriginal story? A remake of the 2007 Israeli film of the same name, The Debt at least does a good job of adapting the original for a new audience. Flashing back and forth between two eras, The Debt tells the story of three Mossad agents who, in 1966, undertook a mission that made them national heroes... But did they really complete their mission, or is there more to the story? Three decades later, having enjoyed a life of some notoriety, the agents must decide whether or not to follow up on their original task, and as more details are revealed, the path becomes more treacherous for all involved. Though the shifts in time may be a little problematic for some at first, I found much to like in The Debt's smartly executed script and impressive acting. With stars like Tom Wilkinson, Helen Mirren, Jessica Chastain, Sam Worthington, Ciaran Hinds, and Marton Csokas filling out the bill, you can be assured this is one thriller that will engage you from start to finish.
B000002OHF|5.0|I had never heard of Wishbone Ash until a friend introduced me to \\"Wishbone Ash Four\\" in the early 70's. Every song on this album seemed to click with me; especially, \\"Ballad of the Beacon\\", \\"Everybody Needs a Friend\\", and \\"Rock 'N Roll Widow.\\"<br /><br />Ash is definitely an \\"acquired taste;\\" but then again, I never cared about \\"popularity\\" in the music I listened to. I recommend this album in combination with \\"Argus.\\" And, if you like 'em both, then \\"Live Dates\\" would be a nice addition to your collection.

B005GVW05Q|2.0|I am a big Ryan Adams fan, and have been awaiting his return, but this is a weak album full of dragging, completely forgettable songs. I kept hoping to hear some classic Ryan Adams shine through, but there's no trace of him.
B003Y5H5C4|1.0|Back in 2009, director Ruben Fleischer burst onto the scene with a bona fide hit in Zombieland, an uproarious take on the zombie flick genre that won both critical acclaim and big box office receipts and marked Fleischer as one to keep an eye on. 30 Minutes or Less, Fleischer's second feature, was therefore something of a disappointment for many. Loosely based on a true story, 30 Minutes or Less was marred by some controversy over the fact that it made light of events that, in reality, ended in tragedy, but that was only part of the reason I was left a bit unimpressed. Despite a talented cast, the narrative -- about a typical pizza delivery guy who's forced by dimwitted crooks to rob a bank with a bomb strapped to his chest -- is disjointed, and makes the mistake of substituting crude gags for true lowbrow humor; I therefore award it a mere one star. The film is funny in spots, and the actors certainly know how to pull their weight, so you may get some mileage out of the film, but don't expect anything on the level of Zombieland.
B005URRCUY|3.0|I have listened to this a few times.  I am glad to see they are evolving  and trying to push.  I like them.  They are certainly a lot better than most \\"big\\" bands.  If you go listen to the band SWEET (seventies UK glam  power pop band) you will totally see where they got this sound.  I know they say they have been listening to them and it clearly shows much more than the Clash or the Cars.  I like the Sweet so I don't mind and maybe it will get them more credit in the US.  I hear Zep too.  If anything, this record is a little too derivative but I think they know it was time to do something different.  I did not think the last record was much of a progression.
0763644765|4.0|This is a cute book. Simple; yet gives kids the picture that this kid is *anticipating* having to go to potty. This is a great concept that this book is helping me get across to our almost-2-year-old. It's a good way to show her that we need to realize when we *have to go*.....I would highly recommend this book.
0375842381|5.0|My daughter and I read these together this summer and we both loved them. Adventure, excitement, beauty, philosophy, and just the right amount of fear/danger for a middle schooler.
B0000024YL|4.0|I like this compilation, even though there are bigger and better ones out there. This is an earlier CD, and the sound quality isn't the best I've ever heard, but I still enjoy the CD.<br />Many of my favorite S&G tracks are among the songs here. I think the duo recorded some of the best and most beautiful songs of the '60s (and 1970). Strangely, though, a few of the songs here are not the studio recordings originally released, but live versions, which I don't think have appeared on any other CDs (except \\"For Emily...\\"). I don't mind the live versions of \\"For Emily...,\\" \\"Kathy's Song,\\" or \\"Feelin' Groovy\\" so much, but I don't like that \\"Homeward Bound\\" is also live. The live performance of that song is O.K., but it's not nearly as good as the \\"studio\\" version, in my opinion.<br />And, the audience applause at the end of that track spills over well into the beginning of \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water\\" (covering up the piano intro), which I find irritating.<br />The applause at the end of \\"Feelin' Groovy\\" spills over into \\"Sound Of Silence\\" (no, the songs are not in chronological sequence) and covers up the guitar opening, but that doesn't bother me so much.<br />Also, the inclusion of the brief \\"Bookends\\" doesn't really do much for the comp, at least not to me.<br />Still, despite this CD's flaws, I think it's a very good collection, although I think the later, like-titled collection is a better single-CD comp.

B004EPZ0BG|5.0|I thought this would be a chick flick but I watched it with my wife to be nice. I loved it! It is a sexy and funny story with a life lesson from dad included. The lead actress, Mila Kunis, is a cute doll and plays the role to perfection. Justin Timberlake does his usual great job playing the funny guy. It is like one of his Saturday Night Live skits but it is the length of a movie.<br /><br />This is a really good movie and a good love story about finding the right one. Did I say funny? I laughed throughout the entire movie. It even has touching moments regarding family love and caring for an elder father. Watch it, you will enjoy it!

B001TH16DS|3.0|This version of Season I is excellent. The quality and options are very impressive. The condition of the item that I received was very poor though. The seller said the product was \\"Like New\\" or Very good but the case for the discs was badly damaged, obviously before it was shipped to me. So overall I was very impressed with the viewing experience, but not the seller.

B004EPYZSK|4.0|There were a couple of things that made me groan a little about this movie, but not enough to make it lose its enjoyability. The ending was a little cliche, but I suppose you could expect that with a summer western/sci-fi mash-up. The only other thing that made me groan was the fact that, like most films, they cast Hispanics as Native Americans in many cases. I'll give them credit, though. They did at least have some Native Americans portraying Native American characters. That's more than can be said for a lot of movies. The effects were pretty good and the film was well-paced with bursts of action and little spaces to let you catch your breath. There were even a few sprinkles of humor in there if you paid attention. I liked it enough to want to add it to my collection. That's actually pretty high praise coming from me because I'm rather picky about my movies. So, onto the wish list it went.
B005P89F1C|5.0|Item came quick and was what I expected. I would purchase from this buyer again. Item was what I expected.
B0061JPYX2|4.0|Amy Winehouse had the goods. Talent. This CD has all variations of Winehouse. The good, the bad and the ugly. Her dreadful take of a \\"A Song For You\\" is all things ugly. Her duet with Tony Bennett is up for a Grammy. Why? Winehouse sounds drunk and out of it. The good on this is \\"Our Day Will Come\\",\\"Between The Cheats\\", \\"Valerie\\" and \\"Half Time\\". Winehouse worked the often covered \\"Girl From Ipanema\\" with her signature soul renderings! Sad how it took her to die to finally get NEW product out. \\"Que Sera, Sera\\".
B005K0HDGE|5.0|The only disappointment in this book is that it had to end.  I usually finish one book on my Kindle & immediately start another...but this one just left me wanting more of the same.

B0000A02TZ|1.0|Here it is, Friday night, finally, after a long, hard week at the office. Would love nothing more than to watch one of my favorite movies with my girlfriend...but no, I'm forced to sit through an unbearable onslaught of ads, each and every time I click the \\"stop\\" button. After 30 minutes, I'm still unable to watch Animal House and my beloved Flounder. For shame! A pox on all of the houses of the corporate overloads who saw fit to cram these awful ads down our throats. 0 stars, if possible.

1439192812|1.0|Buyer beware!  Dawkins intention with this book is to introduce children to Atheism.  His belief in Neo-Darwinism has led him to claim that all religious belief is tantamount to a virus.  The irony, of his effort, is that Neo-Darwinism is, itself, no more that a secular religion.  Empirical science has dispelled the notion that the \\"simple cell\\" through random chance and natural selection is capable of creating new species.  If Darwinian evolution was a \\"fact,\\" one would expect that \\"fact\\" to be represented in the fossil record.  Instead we find, what is described by Stephen J. Gould, the eminent Harvard paleontologist, as the sudden \\"emergence\\" of entirely new species.  This emergence happens on a large scale throughout the fossil record.  Neo-Darwinian evolution is accepted as fact despite massive evidence to the contrary.  The primary reason for this blind faith in Darwinism is metaphysical naturalism, the faith that only what can be observed through man's senses is real.  So what is the big deal?  It's a big deal to introduce children to a religion that is devoid of moral value.
B004ZN9RWK|5.0|What can I say that hasn't been said already about this album.  It's just incredible.  A song for nearly any mood. I find \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" to be great for reading, relaxing, or 'getting in the mood' for more romantic purposes.  I won't say it is the best Pink Floyd album, because to do so would detract from their other albums like \\"Wish You Were Here\\" that I find equally good.  However, it is one of the greatest albums in rock history.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|This movie was awesome.  The dvd is great. I was amazed by how quick the dvd came.  It arrived on the day it was released.  I will always pre-order my videos I want right away.
B000ATQYT2|4.0|I love the movie. The only reason I did not give this five stars was because when I opened the box it didn't have any Disney movie rewards code in it. I was told that this specific movie would have it.
B005HSG3TC|4.0|I pre-ordered this case before there were any reviews for it, and I started getting buyer's remorse before it ever arrived, just by reading the reviews of the people who got theirs earlier.  I was thinking I was going to have to send it back.  But, now that I have it, I'm happy with it.  As advertised, it's lightweight, fits well, and it protects the Kindle well.  It can be a bit touchy when getting it to stand, but once standing it's fine.  I like to set it on my kitchen counter and watch Arrested Development while I'm making dinner.  It only stands in landscape view, but I basically only use the Kindle in portrait view for reading anyhow, and for that, I prefer to be holding it.  And that's one of its advantages - the back of the Kindle itself is slippery, which makes it hard to hold unless you have a finger on the bottom edge (and now you might bump the on/off button).  With this shell, I can hold it easily just by gripping the long sides.  My only issue - the inside face is a magnet for cat hair!  Overall, a decent shell - much better for me than the early review led me to believe.
B000AAF1U4|5.0|This is one of our all time favorite movies.  The first time we watched it was when a friend  let us borrow her DVD....in 2009....and we have watched it at least fifty times.  The first 10 times I watched it I caught something new I had missed the time before.  I am now buying another one for my friend to replace hers.    I would unreservedly reccommend this movie.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|I first started George RR Martin's ambitious series when only the first three books were out. If you are investigating a feast for crows I'll assume you've already been convinced that this series is a masterpiece.   I stopped reading the series during the gap between finishing a storm of swords and Martin finally finishing a feast for crows. At the time we'd all been waiting for A Dance with Dragons and when that didn't come out I was disappointed and didn't really feel like investing in the next book. Martin's books are long and while amazing do NOT make for light reading so you really have to make the investment for each new book.  So now many years after I started reading Martin's work and he has finally released a Dance with Dragons. I wanted to try it but to prepare myself I wanted to reread the entire series including feast for crows so that all the details (THERE ARE SO MANY DETAILS!!!) would be fresh in my mind when starting a Dance with dragons.  So unlike most readers who picked up a feast for crows when it was first published and then had to wait quite a while to get to many of the main character's and plot points that were left out of this book i had the luxury of A) finally understanding some of the complicated underlying histories that Martin weaves through his story because I reread the first three books and B) knowing once I finished with this book I would have immediate access to Dance of Dragons...I can say I whole-heartedly loved this book. Couldn't put it down!  It was actually a breath of fresh air to have Martin choose just a few stories and really invest in each of them. Most things center around Cersei (she is really flying off the deep end in this book). But the book is by no means limited to king's landing (which I had expected based on other reviews). I especially enjoyed the way in this book, unlike the others, Martin would sometimes introduce a minor character for a single chapter or two. This gave the reader an important insight into apart of the plot we needed to know about without forcing us to then follow a character who would be meaningless and boring if brought up several more times just to satisfy the requirements of being a POV character. We get to learn more about Dorne in this book and I felt that in this book Martin took a bit more time to flesh out the characters because he was taking his time with the plot.   Anyway I won't include any spoilers here but I just wanted to say that if you are on the fence about this book because of the negative reviews don't be. It is different from the first three books but it is not inferior!
1451627289|5.0|I have read every book Mr King has ever published. That has taken quite a few years. He continues his great style in this latest book. From the \\"cocked head\\" what's this? to the \\"Oh ho!\\" answers, he leads you down another prickly path. For those who contemplate the \\"what if\\" of time travel this is for you. A five star read. Enjoy!
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|I find this light weight case works very well to protect the Kindle Fire.  The only thing I would like is the ability to prop up the device in portrait mode.
B004EPYZSK|3.0|I have to admit I was intrigued by the concept. I'm not a huge fan of either westerns or Sci-Fi, but a Western Sci-Fi? Hmm... maybe. When you add the star power of Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford it becomes something you want to see.<br /><br />The movie starts out well. The sets look authentic. The clothes are plain, but nice. Daniel Craig plays the steely man's man to perfection. Harrison Ford growls as a semi-evil cattle baron. There's some cool fight sequences. You're really interested... then the aliens show up and ruin everything that was interesting. Character development gets thrown to the wind in favor of cheesy action sequences.<br /><br />Mind you, it will keep you entertained up until it's illogical final battle sequence. It's worth a watch, but the lost potential is a little depressing.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Loved it! Great progression of a story that is so unique. A lot of people are disappointed with this book, but I think it is the perfect ending for this tragic story.
B001AGXEAG|5.0|This is a great movie.  I watched it when I was a kid and now watch it with my kids.  It's even entertaining to my 2 year-old.  I would definitely recommend this movie.
B0051CSIKQ|4.0|Not a huge Vamp fan, but went into this with low expectations and was surprised. The movie is far from perfect, some bad dialogue, some bad acting etc but overall a good movie considering all the crap that's out there now. If your a zombie fan this movie also works on that same level.
B000I0QK74|5.0|This is my favorite holiday cd, offering plenty of traditional charm, great arrangements and a nod to contempporary sensibilities with this comfortable collection.  Whenever I have played it at a holiday gathering at least one or two of the guests ask me the name of the cd.  At the terrific price, this cd also makes a lovely small remembrance for many on my gift list, as well as an additional gift for others. This is a terrefic cd, don't miss it!
B005B19UPE|5.0|This is a fabulous book about the French's participation in the Jewish round up and needs be praised. Not only did the author do a fantastic job filling in the blanks and bouncing back and forth between then and now, but made it exciting to learn more.
B000H4QD1O|5.0|I watched all episodes of the first and only season (on Netflix) and the follow up movie \\"Serenity\\".  I enjoyed all and wish the series had not been cancelled.  It's not for kids as the captain's love interest is a \\"companion\\", i.e. a high class prostitute/geisha/tantric priestess or something or other.
B0055Q5F36|5.0|This case works and fits perfectly on my new ATT SGII. After reading the reviews I did end up purchasing a different screen protector because the one that comes with is made for the international model. I used to own an Iphone with the defender case and it was an amazing series, so naturally I wanted to stick with Otterbox. I was hesitant about the commuter series, but after having used it for awhile its more than adequate to protect my new hardware.
1419702238|5.0|Again, our son loves this collection, he now has the complete set. I enjoy watching him read this set, hearing him laugh and showing the animated pictures.
0385737955|5.0|Can someone tell me why it took so long to read this book??? Seriously, I have been missing out!!! The Maze Runner was seriously amazing, and I'm really disappointed in myself for wasting so much time NOT reading it!! The end of every chapter is like a mini-cliff hanger that had me up way too late at night reading so I could find out what was happening!<br /><br />The characters are all pretty hilarious. Thomas, the protagonist, is definitely a go-getter. Although he doesn't know what's going on, he won't take no for an answer. He breaks all the right rules and doesn't waste time thinking, he just does. Minho and Newt are great characters as well. They're both really sarcastic and pretty funny, but they definitely realize what they have in Thomas.<br /><br />The story is AWESOME. Seriously, I don't have a single negative thing to say about it!! I couldn't stop reading, and although I was constantly thinking, \\"WTF is going on here?!\\" I had permanent goosebumps while I was reading! There are so many things going on, and Dashner is always throwing in different twists and turns to keep you on the edge of your seat! I'm really impressed with the way he writes, and although it took a little bit to get used to the weird language the Gladers use, like shuck-face and shank, I actually started using the words with my friend who has also read the books!<br /><br />I definitely recommend The Maze Runner to anyone and everyone!! I think anyone who likes action, adventure, dystopian, mysteries, hell anything! If you like ANYTHING you will like this book!! I have to admit though, I was bawling like a baby by the end! Some seriously sad stuff happens, but I'll leave you with that... I recommend EVERYONE should read this book, literally everyone. Even boys who don't like to read much will love this one!! And yes, I say boys because most of the boys I know don't read. So go pick up a copy of this one NOW!
B005KN5AES|4.0|This indeed is a solid effort from a much underratted band that has mangaed to stand the test of time. When you mention the name Riot, you quickly think of those classic gems, \\"Narita\\" and \\"Fire Down Under\\". Many people have overlooked 3 other Riot gems that may be just as good as the afore mentioned, \\"Born In America\\", \\"Thundersteel\\" and \\"Army of of One\\" (my personal favorite). I picked up \\"Army of One\\" as a Japanese import but it was worth every penny!!! I highly recommended it! While the new album rocks, I found the vocals to be slighly different than those on \\"Sons of Society\\" and \\"Army of One\\". I'm glad to see that Riot is still around and continuing to put out some first-rate rock! I can't wait for the next album!

B004G5ZY7E|5.0|\\"The Snowman\\" by Jo Nesbo is -- in a word -- excellent. This story is, fellow readers, as good as a modern day police detective story can possibly get.  You don't even have to like police detective stories to enjoy this tale, provided you can forgive the slightly over-the top gruesome aspects of the murders and the rather persistently psychologically self-absorbed Harry Hole (the very human hero, an Oslo police inspector). Then you'll enjoy it as much as I did.<br /><br />Yes, there are a few too many characters to keep track of, all with names that are difficult for an American to remember, a little too much detail about the weather and the various districts of Oslo, and a somewhat over-complicated plot. These are minor criticisms. I found this book a genuine \\"page turner\\", or in the electronic world of my Kindle, a \\"page-up clicker.\\"  (Yes, we need a new modern-day gizmo replacement phrase for \\"page turner.\\")<br /><br />\\"Snowman\\" is the 7th in the Harry Hole series and the 5th translated to English. I must say that the translations get better and better.  I thought the first translated books were poorly done, and I wished back then that I could have read them in the original Norwegian. No longer have that feeling.<br /><br />What was great about the story was that I thought I had it all figured out - early even, but I was wrong time after time. Early in the story, you meet and conclude things about all those who would become \\"suspects,\\" and Nesbo plays with your (my) tendency to jump to conclusions, as much as he did with his fellow officers' similar tendency.<br /><br />Harry's love interest Rakel is a primary character in this story, a feature about which I was pleased. But when her and her son Oleg's lives were endangered, her involvement got dicey. With some losses, injuries and new awareness, though, the ending was reasonably satisfying.  It wasn't as if the cavalry rode in to save the (or most of the) good guys. Nope, here Harry Hole actually solves the case with his own brains and brawn - even if some of it was a bit phantasmagorical - including some almost physical magic, one might say, during the denouement. But at least circumstances or miracles don't win the day. Harry does. Kudos to Nesbo for making his flawed hero actually solve the case.<br /><br />It's a 4.7 on Amazon's scale, upgraded to 5 for the thrill factor and for its being simply very well written.with his own brains and brawn - even if some of it was a bit phantasmagorical - including some almost physical magic, one might say, during the denouement.

1597801585|3.0|Book Review of Windup Girl    Wind-up girl is a creative book which talks about a disaster happens in the future world. The setting of that story is in Bangkok, Thailand. At that time, all the food is contaminated, and people use calorie as their energy to survive. Bioengineers created new species as Cheshire and Wind-up people, and countries are destroyed by environmental problems. As most lands were submerged by the sea because of the Global Warming, based on this idea Bacigalupi makes his story happen in one remote and unfamiliar country, Thailand. Readers' attention and interest are highly attracted when the world seems to become one part, which makes all conflicts are zoomed in. I feel this book tells a trend of the world development. Countries are delocalized and become one part. Corporations compete with each other in order to derive more profits from this chaos period. This book is definitely an award winning piece, because it combines many unique elements of 21st century science fiction, and the imagination of the future is attractive, and it is also a kind of warning for all the humans.    Windup Girl has many obvious features as a 21st Century science fiction. First, this novel is a female centered novel. Emiko, a windup girl, is the main character who plays a connecting role for all the main characters in this novel. In the current century, woman's status is much higher than before, and stories no longer develope only based on male characters. Emiko is depicted as a new person who owns super powers, such as she has great hearing ability, and she can run very fast than all the normal people.    Second, it cares more about humankind's emotions rather than advanced techniques. It becomes more a vessel for imagination than for social commentary. Science fictions used to express a kind of fear of unknowns, but now we can tell from this novel people do not have that fear but try to retain what we already have. Novels no longer express the fear of death thatmuch, but try to warn people what they are doing will influence their future.    Third, there are no traditional heroes in this book. Science fiction used to have characters clearly defined as good and bad people. In Windup Girl, however, everyone is narrated very real with both positive and negative personalities. Hock Seng was originally a bad guy, but the way he treated Mai, a homeless girl, could also reflect he has a positive or humane side. Hock Seng was just forced by his destiny to do bad things. Jaidee could be regarded as the best person in this novel, because what he did to Thailand people was heroic, and people call him the tiger of Bangkok. In my opinion, his heroic behavior is only positive toward Thailand people, for people in other countries he might become a negative character. By which I mean there is no clear boundary between right and wrong, because everyone has his or her own standpoint.    The history of Science fictions seems like the history of the world. In 40's-60's, science fiction was based on the \\"WOW\\" of technology. People imagined how the world could be changed and what their future could be. Then in the next 10 years, topics like how technology affected people's lives was popular, and one representative of those books is \\"Good News from the Vatican\\". In the 80's science fiction was earth-based and talked appearance of choices we must take. Many books talked our community life, and reminded people of the importance of family. When advanced technology becomes more and more involved in our daily life, people began to centralize morality as the main topic in books from the 90's.   In Windup Girl, we can still find the trend of 90's, such the vagueness and very self-referential writing style, and the concealment of information. Books used to have clear introduction about all the setting and background, however, in this book everything was described, but not explained. The inter-culture communication is also a very clear feature of this book, as there is an increase in real world globalization. Windup Girl relates to real and current world issues, but it is extrapolated. As a Chinese, I have the same experience as Bacigalupi in China, 2001. One of my friends was contaminated by SARS virus, and I was also kept apart by Chinese government. The author imagine people wearing antiseptic white coats as \\"White Shirts\\", and in the hot weather his skin excreted a lot of sweat, this is depicted as one of the feature of Windup people. All these information are very easy for me to understand, and I do feel his ability of imagination is powerful. Moreover, Thailand lady boys are mentioned in this novel, which is a cultural feature in Thailand.    This book is very successful as the author combined many interesting and mysterious cultural elements and real world issue. Furthermore, his imagination is very audacious and different from traditional science fiction novel. It also reminds people of the importance of environment and nature. I personally don't like this book, because the paragraphs don't have any continuity. Many editors may think this is successful, but it is difficult to read. Besides that, English is my second language, so it was a hard time when I combine all the information together.
0375842209|5.0|It was hard for me to believe that this is a Young Adult novel.  The idea of having \\"Death\\" as narrator was at first confusing and then fascinating.  The foretelling comments by \\"Death\\" gave the story a mesmerizing twist.  I have recommended this book to everyone who would listen.

1451627289|5.0|Yet again, another fabulous book by Mr. King. Of course he ties it to his other books, which makes it fabulous. Between Derry, Pennywise, and many other tidbits I find it truly enjoyable and suspenseful.      As for Amazon, I love you! Truly exceptional service always! Thank you.
B005OLF6BI|5.0|I got to see one of the Speak Now concerts live back in June, and it was one of the best experiences of my entire life! I was so happy to finally receive this DVD/CD in the mail, and it was SOOOO worth the wait! This DVD/CD is great and is almost as good as actually sitting in an arena seeing it live. Taylor is a very talented young woman, and it's absolutely amazing the way she connects with the audience. This isn't an average concert where a girl is sitting on stage playing her guitar, this is a full on Broadway production! If you've ever seen Taylor Swift: Journey to Fearless, you'll know that Taylor is an extremely hard-working, talented, caring person, and the same is shown in this DVD. I really used to dislike Taylor, but I've been totally obsessed for the past couple years, and now I don't know where I'd be without her! Her music is so inspiring, and teens everywhere can easily relate to it. Her songs aren't just about love and boys, they are about real life experiences that many kids go through every day. This DVD/CD is definitely worth buying for yourself or for the Taylor fan in your life!:)  P.S. Ignore the bad reviews of this product, as they were written by people who don't even like Taylor and clearly had nothing else better to do with their time than sit here and make a bad review of this. If you or whoever you are buying this for is a Taylor fan, you'll love it!
B0064J6OMO|1.0|This would have been a great movie; however, the filthy language and overuse of nudity was disgusting.  It has a great plot, but the language and sexual content did nothing but ruin the film.  It was a total waste of money!

B00275EHJG|5.0|How does Pixar do it? Sure, Disney movies have set a high standard for decades (I loved \\"Little Mermaid,\\" my mom still raves about \\"Jungle Book\\" and my grandma, bless her heart, will get feisty defending \\"Snow White\\") but these days Pixar is blowing its parent company right out of the water. I'm sure my boy will be watching this film for decades, getting more and more out of it as he matures. In fact, you could say the sentimental, poignant \\"Toy Story 3\\" is more for adults than kids, as it recalls the transitional nature of childhood in a way only a handful of movies ever have. To be sure \\"Toy Story 3\\" is a comedy (the sight gags, one liners and running jokes are the reasons my little guy loves it so now, after all), but it really will tug at your heart strings. And the story really is for all ages. After watching it I'm still debating with my husband which is funnier: Barbie meets Ken or Jessie meets Buzz the Flamenco dancer.

B0000009N1|5.0|Frank Zappa/ Hot Rats (RYCO version):  \\"Peaches en Regalia\\" may be the only Zappa song the radio plays anymore.  \\"Willie The Pimp\\" has the only vocals on the album.  While I have never been a Captain Beefheart fan (Beefheart is the `singer' here) Zappa uses him to the best effect.  The rest of the album contains more of Zappa's brilliant instrumental orchestrations.  Hot Rats is a great album.
B004529NLG|5.0|Very good use of 3D, the dance moves were outstand and the AAA+ 3D made you feel like you are in the middle of it all. Outstanding depth thruout the movie.
B00006AW2G|5.0|The Rolling Stones/ Let it Bleed (1986 remaster CD):  The fact that Brian Jones did play on a couple of the tracks showed that, when he wasn't stoned, he was still an artist but when he was stoned, he became a drag on the music.  The firing of Brian Jones (and his subsequent tragic death) strangely enough brought in the `new blood' that the band needed to rejuvenate their approach towards the music and allowed them to create this Masterpiece album.  It has been said that `nothing new comes about without blood', \\"Let it Bleed\\" brought about `The World's Greatest Rock N Roll Band'.
B006JIVRYA|5.0|This show is so good its like true blood but ghosts......this episode was one my favs!!!!! This show has never had had a bad episode love love love it.
B0000067L4|4.0|Cream/ Goodbye:  Cream created this odds and sods album to satisfy a contractual obligation which explains its severely disjointed nature.  We have heard \\"I'm so Glad\\", \\"Politician\\" and \\"Sitting on Top of The World\\" before, but these are good alternative live versions.  Here we get the studio version of \\"Badge\\".  Then we get \\"Doing that Scrapyard Thing\\" which sounds like the kind of pop single we would become used to from other groups in the mid 1970's.  \\"What a Bringdown\\" ends the regular album nicely.  The old CD I have (which may not be available anymore) added a seventh cut of \\"Anyone for Tennis\\".<br /><br />This is a frustrating album in many ways.  We expected more than this, however, what is actually ON the album isn't bad.  It (barely) rates four stars.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|More than &quot;just another alarm app&quot;, this app is fully customizable for each alarm you set, which is helpful for multiple daily alarms you can set each one to behave differently, letting you know, without looking,.what the alarm is for. I also like that you can set an unlimited number of alarms, essential for my busy day. I'm sure I'll upgrade to ad free version.
B000002UB3|5.0|The Beatles/ Abby Road (1990 CD):  This was the last Beatles album (though not the last to be released) and it shows that The Beatles talent was even greater than their following.  You don't have a music collection if you don't have Abbey Road.
0141439513|5.0|It seems almost pointless to write a simple review on this book, but I'm going to anyway.  I had to read this for my Women in Literature and Visual Arts class, and it was enjoyable.  The characters are well developed, and the plot is simple enough to understand.  Overall the book was a bit dry for my personal taste, but it was still good.  Jane Austen is a superb author, so it is certainly worth reading.
B000002J03|5.0|Led Zeppelin/ II : The second Masterpiece album from Led Zeppelin.  If you don't have it, you ought to get it.
B0013ND30W|5.0|This is difficult to find now, since it's back in the vault, but it is certainly worth owning.  The Blu-ray version is simply amazing, as it always is for Disney films.  Sadly, it is not set to release again until 2013-2015.  The story of Sleeping Beauty is excellent.  Certainly worth buying if you can find it.
B004Q7CIFI|4.0|Very political slanted to Liberals.  I doubt the conservatives will enjoy it much.  Bogs down in middle a bit and can't give it a 5 because of lack of video which was promised in price.  But if you enjoy the Kennedys and believe in the \\"right wing conspiracy\\" you won't be dissapointed.
B00271DNP4|5.0|I haven't read any of the books, and I saw this movie years ago when it came out, but recently watched it again with the family.  It was better than I remembered.  The story, acting, scenery, special effects, etc. are all quite good, so we all enjoyed the movie.  I just don't care for the darker mood of the movie as compared to the brighter original, and there's nothing particularly \\"deep\\" here.  There's also a time travel aspect of the story which generates the usual logical contradictions, but it's handled smoothly enough that the contradictions can be ignored.  So I'll go with 4 stars rather 5, though I can still recommend it to people interested in a fantasy action movie which has some scary elements.
0230759637|5.0|A red rose means love, everyone knows that. How about Canterbury Bells or Mistletoe then? Most people know that flowers convey certain feelings and while we still revert to a floral language by giving flower bouquets on special occasions, much of the meaning behind the individual flowers has been reduced to a very limited and generalized one since Victorian times.  Mandy Kirkby presents a wonderful book with The Language Of Flowers: A Miscellany, the official companion to the novel of the same title by Vanessa Diffenbaugh. Enveloped with beautiful illustrations and poetry, you learn about the meaning and history of fifty different flowers. Short and crisp the author introduces each flower in a perfect blend of information and fascinating references of how a certain flower makes an appearance in certain books, poems, or even paintings. An emotional dictionary and the suggestions on composing posies for specific occasions such as courtship, births, or funerals round off this miscellany.  Just like similar books were meant for the coffee table, to be studied and indulged in, in Victorian times, this adorable book has invited me more than once to browse in it since first reading it. If you've ever been fascinated by flowers and their meaning, I can only recommend this lovely compendium. It goes without saying it also makes for a lovely gift to a good friend. Just don't forget to include a freesia when you present it!  In short: A gorgeous gift book in best Victorian tradition!

B005X7HAAS|2.0|A fair amount of well executed (so to speak) violence in a well made but routine yakuza film. Takeshi Kitano makes so many movies they can't all be great. This one isn't - but it's not terribly bad, either.
B005Y423ZC|5.0|Everyone should own this. Adele is a Goddess. This is THE BEST concert DVD I have ever seen. She is charming as ever and sounds fantastic.
0374275637|5.0|The book is a bit of a slow burner, gradually building up until you start to understand the material as a whole instead of little pieces of data and information. By the last page I could actually feel my thinking changed, and I can't remember the last time a book has done that to the same degree.   In a nutshell, life is (often) counterintuitive, our reasoning is biased and when presented with a tough question we'll often simply substitute it for an easier one believing it to be the same thing, and what is most interesting is that the author readily admits to succumbing to the same biases which he illustrates in his prose, even though he is aware of it in the first place - such is the dominance of the 'fast' thinking side of the brain.  I found all of it fascinating.

I purchased this thinking \\"yea!  my daughter doesn't have to stare at my backside when we go on bike outings!\\"....yeah...I'd rather have her in the backside view than have this thing on my bike.  Stick to a back seat attachment or a bike trailer than this.

0060934700|5.0|I bought this book because I am an avid Neil Gaiman fan. The short stories are nice, because I'm in college right now, and I only have time for about 3 or 4 pages at a time. Each story is a gem in itself, I've even read a few more than once. I would recommend this book for anyone who has little time, but still wants to read beautiful writing.

B005IML464|5.0|I have only had this collection for a few days. So I have only managed to sample a fraction of the music herein. But everything I have listened-to (the Missa Solemnis is playing, as I type these words) has been superlative, both sonically and in the performance.  There is mercifully little \\"filler\\" in this collection and, at the price ($32.41, as a pre-order; currently $40.15), it is an incredible bargain.  Finally, unlike the first reviewer, I had no problem ripping the CDs to audio files on my computer.
B0061JPYX2|5.0|i luved this cd even if the version of valarie is a bit different i would've better the version from mark ronson's cd or the version from the brit awards but still it was beautiful just to have one last cd from amy even if some material is old or half finished.
0307593312|1.0|I admit to being more than a little mystified at all of the reviews with 4 and 5 stars until it came to me:  I was reading an entirely different book!  Obviously I and other 1 and 2 star reviewers live in an alternate universe, and instead of receiving the wonderful, magical, breathtaking creation got the plotfree, boring, lifeless tome.  No wonder the characters in my version of IQ84 seem two-dimensional:  they ARE two-dimensional, which makes perfect sense since they live in..another...dimension.  OK.  So much for trying to be cute about this.  IQ84 is easily the worst book I have picked up in some time.  The 'plot' is infantile, the sex scenes adolescent and the premise simply doesn't work.  This book can't decide if it wants to be a pretentious  literary work or a science fiction potboiler.  In the end it fails on both counts.  No, I take that back:  I didn't get to the end.  After 600 or so pages my eyes glazed over and I quit.  Fortunately, I was reading this thing on a cruise, and, as we all know, reading is a major part of cruising - right up there with dining. Resisting the urge to hurl IQ84 over the side, I padded off to the ship's library and traded it in for, not one, but two books in Martha Grimes \\"Emma Graham\\" series.  I think that was a pretty good deal.
B005JLN9ZI|5.0|The Cd is great, he really has outdone himself. Each song was a reflection of his talent, and his collabo's were a smart choice. Get it before its gone!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was a great read! I wasn't sure I would like it but once I got started I couldn't put it down. I read it in a matter of days which is highly unusual for me. The character development is excellent and makes you really care about Katniss, Gale and Peeta. I was hooked and immediately started the next in the series after reading this one. I'm looking forward to the movie next year and hope they do a good job of adapting it.
B000002NJM|5.0|If you love oldies from the 70's you will jove this soundtrack. The move was great and so is the soundtrack. The songs from this move take me back to the go old days.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I couldn't wait to read this one after finishing Hunger Games. This is a wonderful series and keeps you wanting more.

0345529057|4.0|The content of the books is great. I love the story that Martin tells. The quality of these paperbacks is lacking. After a single readthrough, there is significant noticeable wear on the cover and the pages. I haven't run into any unreadable pages or binding falling apart, but they look like crap after you read them.
0061980269|5.0|I read this book years ago. My 14 year old granddaughter will be required to read this in her second semester of her freshman year in HS. The teacher had enough to provide all the kids with a copy but I decided to get her her own copy. I am sure it is the same as when I was a child. I would recommend To Kill a Mockingbird to anyone. The movie was terrific but the book is always better.
B004W4N55C|3.0|I really love the website ultimate-guitar.com, so I figured I'd give this app a shot (especially since it was free). The app has good intentions, but it doesn't really follow through with something that is easy and nice to use. The auto text scroll isn't well designed, and the tuner doesn't work very well at all. I think with a few improvements, this can be a really nice app.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I'm not a fan of fantasy stories and my heart sank when, after a great beginning, I realized that's what this was going to be. However, if I had known, I never would've bought this and would've missed out on one of the best of the 50+ books I've read this year. Like other reviewers, I was watching the bar of my Kindle rapidly approaching the end when it still seemed impossible for matters to be resolved in such a short time. As much as I wanted the story to go on, books have to end, and this one did so not with a conclusion, but with the ending of an era and the beginning of a new adventure. After feeling a little disappointed at things not being wrapped up neatly, I realized there is no other way to end a book like this. To continue to a more conclusive ending, or for that matter to write a sequel, would only be to repeat the last 1/4 of the story over and over again until all the enemies the world over were gone. If you've read The Talisman by Stephen King, then you know how monotonous and irritating that would become.
0385344325|1.0|I have not, and will not read this book, because of the price--the Kindle edition costs more than the hardcover.  I have purchased previous books in this Reacher series when they were $9.99 and less. Am I in the twilight zone?  What are these publishers thinking?  I refuse to pay over $9.99 for a Kindle book.  I know there are probably tens of thousands of other Kindle owners who have done the same.  I bet these higher prices do not make up for the lost sales.
0946535256|4.0|This is a great book for those who used to play trumpet and want to get back in it after a long break, or for beginners who want to learn jazz trumpet right away. The book is easy to understand and teaches the basics of trumpet in a very clear fashion.  You will learn the basic scale and note on trumpet, finger positioning and most importantly, how to breathe (this cannot be understated).  But what really makes the book worth it is the tutorial CD. There are dozens of songs which you can play along with that start of with very, very simple notes to much more complex trumpet solos. It's really like playing with a Jazz band in your own home. And playing just the trumpet part of the song makes you feel like you are on stage every lessons. It's fun and a great motivational tool to get better and start playing more complex parts and solos.   If you are a beginning just looking to learn and mess around this book is great. I would say that if you are trying to become a serious player, an actual in-person lesson from a trumpet player has no replacement as a teacher can help you avoid bad habits which will hurt your playing in the long term. And also, this book is strictly focused on trumpet from a jazz perspective. But for the trumpet enthusiast, the curious or those who played for years as a kid and just want to belt out some good sounds, this book is a good way to get back in the game.
B005L38QK2|4.0|The SteelSeries Diablo III Gaming mouse is a love/hate relationship. On one hand this mouse is extremely comfortable to use and has great built-in features. On the other hand the mouse buttons on the right side are easily mis-clicked and the ones on the left feel quite soft to me. Either way, this mouse has a lot more positives then it does negatives. Highly recommended to those who love Diablo. I would still recommend to those who don't love Diablo, but they may not care for all the Diablo branding on the mouse.  Pros:    * Extremely comfortable and durable design    * SteelSeries Engine Software is intuitive and hassle-free to use    * The Diablo III branding on the mouse is tastefully done  Cons:    * The side buttons were more trouble then they should be and felt a bit soft when pressed.  This mouse was provided to me free of charge by SteelSeries for the sole purpose of writing an honest and thorough review of this product.

B005HV6Y5W|4.0|Terrence Malick has always made films loaded with gorgeous images, and frail characters. \\"The Tree of Life\\" is no different, with its endless mood shots and accompanying musical score. I can't say I disliked it, since I really didn't understand what was going on. I DO know that its basic message is that life is short.<br /><br />Brad Pitt and Jessica Chastain were good, and the little kids were exceptionally good; Sean Penn did what he could with all 5 of his minutes of screen time.<br /><br />Exquisitely photographed, with a very fine score, I could see watching it again when I had nothing better to do...but there always seems to be something better to do.<br /><br />Not for everyone...
0307477479|4.0|This book takes us on a journey through time to show the effects on a group of individuals related to the punk rock scene on the 80s and details where and how those individuals arrived where they are today.  Time has the effect of a roller coaster with a constantly mutating tracks.  When you get on the ride you don't end up where you think you're going.  That's how this book feels the whole time.  I'm generally not a fan of post modern writing , but I do like Jennifer Egan's work.  Her creativity in the way this story is told makes it engaging, especially the chapter that's written all in PowerPoint.  If you like her other books you will not be disappointed in this one.
B004K4AVAG|1.0|I will never understand the appeal of Lady GaGa.  Now, I am a diva lover, but GaGa is no diva.  The album is nothing but electronic drivel!  And the sad thing is that people call what she does as \\"refreshing\\" \\"new\\" and \\"controversial.\\"  How??!  Madonna did everything and more than GaGa 20 or more years ago!  And with Madonna, the music was good and, at least in the earlier years, focused on the song and not so much of this electronic, vocoder \\"my voice sounds like a computer\\" garbage.  To me, GaGa is talentless.    I used to be a huge Madonna fan/collector until her music started sounding like electronic, recycled drivel.  The problem is that all pop music sounds the same; overloaded with electronic synths.  You want real talent?  Download Adele's new album, or Florence and The Machine.  True pop music is dying, and GaGa isn't helping any.    Listen to \\"Government Hooker\\" for example!  Absolute crap!  I'll admit, there were certain tracks on Fame Monster that I liked, but BTW is a horrid album that sounds like all other recycled, electronic ick!  I understand that this generation needs a new gay icon, I suppose, but GaGa?  Stop capitalizing on the gays, GaGa!  That's all she does!    I know her album will, and has, sold millions.  I guess I'm just sad that pop music has devolved into such garbage!  Sad that we lost Amy Winehouse.  She was another one that made pop music come alive.

B0063IH60K|5.0|Well, I have cancer. Scratch that, HAD cancer, because this awesome little app fixed that problem for me. By playing rounds of cards in it's smooth interface and configuring it's wealth of options, my body took it upon itself to fight off that brain tumor. I had a blast doing it too! Also, I just met a super model and she saves she loves me! A+ will play again.
B004DNWPY4|5.0|It provides irrefutable statistical proof that giving money to your kids does great harm.  The punch line is that they will earn 15% less over their life time.  So if their profession should earn $100,000 a year for 40 years, the $50,000 you give them for a down payment on a house they can't afford will cost them $600,000 in life time earnings.  do you want to take $600,000 away from your kids? Probably not.  this book should be required reading in high school, and before anyone takes out a student loan.

1612130283|5.0|I am Fifty Shades of obsessed with Christian Grey...This book is amazing...it's a shame there are only 5 stars to allocate, I'd gladly give it 50 (pun intended).  This book was an excursion into an arena that many people fear to enter, but E.L. James conquered it with style and flair.  The story was deep, with rich character development that many books containing 'BDSM' leave out.  I will say that the ending left me in such an emotional state that a hang nail would've sent me over the edge...(not that I wouldn't have done EXACTLY what Ana did), but thankfully, the next book is readily available, so I made it through to the other side :)  I think it would be my goal as an author to have some things my readers could carry away with them, hold close, and use in their daily lives...so, some quotes/phrases I will be taking with me are:  \\"Laters baby\\", \\"SHOUTY CAPS\\" (although I've used them, I didn't have such a cute name for them), \\"inner goddess\\", and \\"Fifty Shades of ______\\" (whatever fits, LOL), \\"mean machine\\", and last but not least, \\"twitchy palms\\".  Also, I will never see lip biting, eye rolls, or Ipods in the same way again, and I'm really happy about that :)  I think I will go have some English Twinings Breakfast Tea now, read Fifty Shades Darker, and hope that a passing control freak with twitchy palms like Christian Grey finds me soon, LOL.  Thanks, Ms. James, for giving us this great piece of literature to devour.
1451648537|4.0|I found \\"Steve Jobs\\" the biography to be a fascinating read. It put Steve Jobs into a spotlight that I was not expecting.<br /><br />I had seen the author interviewed on numerous TV shows about the same time as the book was released. I'd also seen the 60-minutes interview which was quite revelatory in its own right. I had read and heard so much about the biography that I was fearful that I already knew most of what would be in the book. While it is true that parts were already \\"out of the bag\\" there was much that was still exciting to discover.<br /><br />The beginning of the personal computer revolution was an exciting time and Jobs was at the forefront of this. Learning all about the humble beginnings of Apple Computer was incredibly interesting, Yet, I feel that the author hardly scratched the surface of the more technological side of things. He emphasized more of the sociological side of the story. That side of the story was written well but I just feel there was more nuts and bolts stuff that was not brought into play in the biography. I did read with interest however how Jobs coped with the knowledge that he had cancer and its relentless progression.<br /><br />I wouldn't say that this will be the definitive biography of Steve Jobs. I'd be quite surprised if there weren't others either in the works right now, or soon to be in the works. Already there are many people opening up and speaking  about what it was really like dealing and interacting with Steve Jobs.<br /><br />Whether or not you are an Apple customer or fan, this is a great glimpse into the life of a man who had a huge impact in how we view and interact with technology. His vision has turned entire industries upside down. He truly was a visionary and his legacy will live on for quite some time.<br /><br />I don't know if I'll live long enough to see where Steve Jobs will ultimately be placed in the list of geniuses... Einstein, Edison, etc,  but he certainly belongs on that list somewhere. The world has lost a great thinker and tinkerer. The loss of such a great mind like that is sad... his contributions were significant. We'll never know what the next \\"one more thing\\" could have been.of such a great mind like that is sad... his contributions were significant.

B0000E6XH3|5.0|If you're a fan of Daft Punk's Discovery and you like good animation with a good story line, then this is the movie for you.  The fact that there is no real dialog in the film and still is able to tell a wonderful story of love and corruption is simply amazing.
B005J29HCQ|2.0|Much has been written about this alleged masterpiece - I don't get it. If Pet Sounds inspired Sgt. Pepper, and Sgt. Pepper inspired Smile then I think it is safe to say that the Beatles won. This might have been OK if it would have just been the Smile tracks as listed on the first CD sleeve along with some exceptional liner notes. But no, this is everything and the kitchen sink.  My daughter is a big Beach Boys fan and as were listening to this in the car she said, \\"Dad, what is this crap?\\" I told her to be patient and give it a chance and after about ten more minutes she said, \\"Dad, this is really bad can we put something else on?\\" She is, of course, referring to the numerous throw-away songs included on Smile and I have to agree with her. Vegetables? Really?  Maybe some great liner notes will make up for the throw-away songs and 'Heroes and Villains' overkill? Sorry, not with this package. Want to know what was wrong with Brian during this period (although he sounds just fine during the studio takes)? Want to know why this album was never completed? Want to know why Van Dyke Parks was brought in rather than writing with the group? Want to know what 'Heroes and Villains' is about? Want to know what \\"Surfs Up' is about? Want to know who the musicians were on each track? Want to know if the Beach Boys played any of the instruments? Want to know who sang lead on each song? Want to know about Bruce Johnston's growing presence in the Beach Boys? You'll learn none of this with these paltry liner notes.  A missed opportunity and a huge disappointment.

1451648537|5.0|My first ebook and I am glad I chose Steve Jobs Biography. It seemed very appropriate reading it on my iPad. As I read about the products that Steve imagined and made come to life, I was able to touch and feel his passion. I have a new appreciation os Steve and what he brought to the world. Now that I have finished reading I have 2 recommendations. Read this book and also use Steve's legacy to read books.  I was amazed how easy the iPad was to read on.

B004R13U6Y|5.0|Works great on the Kindle Fire.  I haven't really found a flaw with this app. I have some poorly OCRed scans that are unreadable on the built in Kindle Fire reader, but look good on ezPDF.  It has the page turn animation, if you are into that. It can also be disabled.  The turns are smooth, and the next page loads quick. even with large (50mb) PDFs. Highlighting,  underlining, making notes, and writing freehand are all easy to do.  This app has so many features, I only use maybe 1/10 of them. I think the app is worth much more than they are asking.

B005PTQPU0|2.0|I am so disappointed.  Kate, as an artist myself I know what it feels like to fill in the dry spells by flogging an old idea to a bloody pulp.  I try not to do it and yet, sometimes I will wake up and see that I am doing it again!  All production by an established and talented artist is NOT necessarily presentable to the world at large!<br />This is one of the most irritating albums I have heard in a long time.<br />I loved Ariel, and I've been a fan ever since RollInTheBall as seen on Saturday Night Live in the late seventies. Even the packaging on this one set my teeth on edge.  (Slick, but if you are going to create the appearance of snow bas-relief, why not do it in real snow and not Photoshop?)  But my main gripe is that I do not appreciate hearing the same two chord progressions for 40 minutes.  Only one who can pull that off, to my mind, is Robert Fripp.  Boring boring!!  The first minute, two minutes, three minutes are just fantastic.  And then....I don't like the Joni Mitchell sound, although I also know that in our fifties the voice can change.  Musically, this recording is just empty.  I can't even listen to the words because I am so irritated by the repeating sound of it.<br />Should have stayed on the shelf in Kate's private folder of ideas not-fleshed-out.<br />I will buy the next one, however, with HOPE.

If you are thinking about buying this book just wait and it should be available at the library for free.
B005IS565S|3.0|I love Ivan Moody's voice, unfortunately his lyrics range from pretty good to kind of predictable, but at least they're normally tolerable. On this album, the lyrics are what make me skip the song. They have that bland kindergarten rhyming gimmick of other FFDP albums, but here they are even cornier and even more laughable. Besides that, the music is what you'd expect from a FFDP album, and Ivan Moody does manage to have some fairly memorable vocal melodies for the choruses, so the album isn't a total loss. It's just really nothing new or innovative, and to me not one song sticks out from the others.
B005H0IW6W|1.0|I thought I loved Michael but not so happy with this music - just an average Christmas product - price was good
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I am about the same age as Steve Jobs and I am in the software business, so much of this story was enjoyable because I lived through many of the events in the book.  I understand the generation that Steve came out of and the culture he grew up in.  That made this a great history book as well as a great biography.  The book is long, but it's a fast read.  The story is fast moving and never gets dull.  As a person, Steve Jobs was very complex, which makes him interesting.  As a designer and businessman, he had a very big role in the history of the late twentieth century.<br /><br />This book tells a story, not only of Steve Jobs, which is fascinating on its own, but also a story of the technology revolution that occurred in the last 40 years.  The cultural and historical shifts from this revolution are still being experienced.<br /><br />I want my grandkids to read this book when they are older. I hope they look past many of Steve Job's quirks and see what it was like to live during the times when innovation was so fast and exiting that we couldn't predict what would happen next.
B002GZQY6Q|5.0|This is a fantastic album. As you probably gathered from other reviews and critic's descriptions, it's on 2 discs: the first having the body of the album in what Steve Wilson called an hour-long song cycle and the second disc containing four strange yet beautiful songs.  It's kind of like one big song divided up into smaller sections, and then four bonus tracks.  Some claim the album is not stellar or just doesn't have the same magic as its predecessor, \\"Fear of a Blank Planet\\".  Comparisons aside, it's still a great album.  You really get the idea that Steve and the band really put forth effort to make a great album, taking risks and giving it their all.  It's silly to think it should've been better than their last, but how often can you strike lightning?  Also, not many people seem to note that they had a LONG career before they made \\"In Absentia\\".  That's often the gateway album for newcomer Porcupine Tree fans, but it's also their sixth or seventh album.  The albums that preceded \\"In Absentia\\" have more of a softer, atmospheric, Pink Floyd's \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\"-in-its-entirety kind of feel.  To summarize, this album incorporates some of the older elements of Porcupine Tree and blends them with their more recent habits.  Even considering that, this is still its own album not trying to sound like anything else.

And \\"Lonely Days Lonely Nights\\" is an awesome blues guitar effort with some damn fine lead work. \\"Come 'An Get It\\",\\"Girl\\",\\"Would I Lie To You\\",and \\"Hit And Run\\" should be textbook examples as to how simple, straight-forward, rock and roll should be played!!!

0143034901|4.0|A river of descriptive and adulant sentences has already filled the critical reviews here and elsewhere.  This is an exceptional book.  But it is compared in early reviews--are most newspaper/on-line book reviews now \\"for pay\\"?--to a variety of great authors and works with which it cannot actually share authentic, sanguine company.  While Zafon's book deserves much praise for many reasons, it is not in the class of Borges, Umberto Eco, much less Marquez.  Besides Marquez, the single comparison that best demonstrates this sort of egregious overreaching is to A. S. Byatt's amazing \\"Possession,\\" a masterpiece of knowledge of Victorian high culture, of academic (self-serving) critical obsessions, of extraordinarily brilliant writing, of a part of the history of feminism, and of the vast realms of the hidden human heart.<br /><br />I personally most enjoyed this fine book for the story that it provides of the daunting, often horrifying, life in Barcelona under Franco's murderous dictatorship after 1945, before the city eventually became famous for the Olympics and as a contemporary tourist destination.  Zafon's story showed me all that I only vaguely knew about this city before Spain was liberated from the systematic tortures imposed by the fascists.
B005URRCNQ|1.0|Sorry...I love the Keys.....but this album sounds like a bunch of overproduced,leftovers that couldn't make it on the \\"Brothers\\" album.Which i do like some songs from,but was there worst album before \\"El Crappo\\".....what makes this a bigger travesty,is that if these songs were stripped down and raw like vintage keys,i know i would love it.We get a 2 minute glimpse of what could have been at the beginning of \\"Little Black Submarines\\".But this album mostly sounds like a Gary Glitter \\"rock & roll pt 2\\" compilation.Please don't be offended....save all the \\"Bands need to evolve...go listen to acdc\\"comments.Another one of my favorites has been \\"The rolling stones and beatles changed their sound man!\\"...I love those comparisions...maybe if the Keys are still selling records 40 years from now you can start that argument...it is just one mans opinion.Like my opinion on the stones is i think their best music was 68 -72..i know someone else who wont listen to anything brian jones isn't on.So should i get mad and call him an idiot because thats what he likes?.To me,it looks like the keys best days are behind them.I could be wrong.But if they keep putting out stuff like this?......just my opinion...so go huff and puff on someone elses review
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I watched this a few years ago when it came out on PBS. It was magical and I was transfixed. I loved Ruth Wilson's portrayal of Jane Eyre, without sentimentality or self pity. Jane is simply a wonderful character. And her chemistry with Rochester was fun to watch. I kept thinking about the movie so I finally bought it and I've watched it twice since purchasing it. I highly recommend this version. It just flies by and you'll want to watch it again and again.
1451627289|5.0|This was my first e-book, on my new kindle fire, and one of my first Stephen King novels. and I am pretty well sold on both. As soon as my kindle was out of the box, I decided to order this because reading thick heavy books in bed can be a pain in the wrist. I wondered if an e-reader would change the experience of reading, and I think it does to an extent, but not in necessarily bad way.<br /><br />The whole experience felt sort of dream-like to me. I couldn't be sure how far I was into the book and how long till the end (well, there were percents, but it felt intangible). It wasn't as easy to flip back to an earlier section to re-read something, so I just kept going. The sense of recursion, of things repeating, same but different, is part of the plot structure, so it was all just a bit weird.<br /><br />King has a relaxed, confident style, as befits a guy who has done so well for so long, and it worked well for this story. As soon as we stepped into 1958, I felt I was there. I was born in 1952, so I do remember what 1958 and 1963 felt like. The pollution, the smoking, the attitudes, all felt right to me, as well as the sense of innocence. The book is an odd amalgam of alternative history, science fiction, romance, and post-apocalypse. Yes, there were parts in the middle that were not really necessary to the plot, but by then King had me and I would have followed him down any rabbit hole. I also felt that his descriptions of physical pain, and the agonies of re-building a destroyed body, were made particularly credible by the fact that he himself was almost killed in a car accident.<br /><br />As for the premise that changing one thing in the past would have had the repercussion it did, well that wasn't particularly believable to me, but it was certainly interesting to contemplate. If the book had focused exclusively on the Kennedy assassination, if the rabbit hole had come out in 1963 rather than 1958 and the many sub-plots had been eliminated, maybe it would have been a tighter, more intense novel. But I enjoyed the whole ride. And in the end, the concept of strings made more sense than most time-travel explanations, and has the advantage of being what physicists now actually think is going on.e novel.

B005ELZKWS|5.0|Saw \\"the Foot\\" early last November, about a month after III was released. The concert was at Webster Hall in the East Village, NYC. There are no seats, so everyone stands from the git go. I was ten feet from the stage in the center, packed in tight with several hundred new friends.  I was expecting Hager-fueled good time hard rock with Sensei Satriani showing all how its done. But I hadn't bought III yet, so this was my first time hearing the tunes. So, I wasn't expecting Three and a Half Letters. If you haven't already, check out the sample for a taste.  Long story short, it brought me right back to my youth in the Sixties and the MC5, founders of punk rock and their classic tune, \\"Up Against the Wall Mother<EXPLETIVE DELETED>\\" Three and a Half Letters is a anthem for today's broken world.  Right On, and Rock On Chickenfoot!
B006GKHE6G|3.0|It seems like a game showcased primarily for flaunting the graphical abilities of the tegra chipset. The graphics are gorgeous, and the water physics are realistic, but that is about it. The gameplay itself is challenging, but scratch below the surface and there's not much to keep you interested. The racing is fun, and exhilarating for a few minutes, but then it settles into tedium. This is a great game for 99c but not for $2 or $3 or $4.<br /><br />The different jetskis, and arenas are meant to keep things fresh, but to be honest, they dont influence gameplay in the slightest, no matter which jet ski you pick or which arena, it's all more of the same. You can do stunts and tricks in mid-air but they have absolutely no effect on the game at all, aside from giving you a minimal boost, you dont get extra points for doing these stunts, there's no pay off. so why would anyone do it?<br /><br />but this entire game is less than 50mb download, and i suspect most of that is in the textures and models, leaving not much room for the game itself. which would explain why it is the way it is.
B005JABSB6|5.0|I ordered 4 Sharp AN3DG20B 3D Glasses from amazon for my Sharp LC70LE735U and LOVE them. Lightweight and comfortable. I don't know what the more expensive ones feel like but these are Excellent. I would say don't waste the extra $75 on them just buy these. Plus if you scratch or break these lenses it's only $75 to replace rather than $150.    The only thing I wish I could do is have the option to replace the battery easier if I ran out of juice. But what the hay who watches more than 9 hours of 3D right? Well maybe my son playing the PS3.    I didn't have a 3D disc but my son had a Ratchet and Clank 3D PS3 game so we loaded the newest firmware on it which supports 3D and WOW WOW WOW. Insane to play this game in 3D. I can't play but my son is an expert (what 14 yr old isn't) and watching him play this game was like watching a movie in 3D. Things were just flying at us and it seemed like we could see behind the people and objects.  Can't wait to get Avatar 3D.
0425241505|5.0|I really enjoyed this book and found it a total page turner.  The story was interesting, great descriptive action, and the characters well defined.  My only slight criticism (spoiler coming) was toward the end of the book when the heroine Pia runs away wily nily, knowing bad guys are out there and putting herself and everyone else in danger.  I always hate it when the woman does that because it makes her look weak and stupid. But I still enjoyed reading this and thought Dragos and Pia were a great couple.  I would have liked it to have gone on a bit more.
0316017930|2.0|This book looked interesting, but well, you know.  I was intersted to see that the author writes for New Yorker.  The book reads like a standard length New Yorker article, padded to make it book length.  He frequently tells us what he is going to cover several chapters hence, but doesn't seem to get there.  I confess that I have not finished the book yet, and I may not if something better gets here first.
B00080ZG10|4.0|A good piece of story telling. Using TV footage, radio commentary, the film moves fast - a technique reminds 'Raging Bull'.<br />Change of shot and sequence between different endeavors and whims of Hughes is swift and smooth.<br />The usage of color is of particular interest - a rare hue has been used in the entire film to underline a bygone era story.<br />DiCaprio is impressive - acting for a crazy man marching towards madness runs with risk. He manages it well.<br />The other actors who personify many well known Hollywood figures may not have similarity to the actual persons, still they build the characters well enough.<br />Some scenes are real good - designing and testing of new planes, the crash landing, Spruce Goose and the Senate hearing. We can almost hear Mr. Hughes's inner soul and character during the design processes and especially in the hearing.<br />Only I feel the film has dwelt a but much on Hughes's extravaganza - material beneath the surface could have been better.

1401216676|1.0|This tome is for Alan Moore completists only. This certainly pales in comparison to \\"  V for Vendetta\\", \\" From Hell\\" and \\" The Watchmen\\". There isn't much in the way of character development, though Moore did take the liberty of providing an interesting origin for the Joker. The interplay between Batman and the Joker is rushed and not well thought out. Certainly one of the worst works of Alan Moore. If you are interested in Batman look towards Arkham Asylum and The Dark Knight Returns. The \\"Killing Joke\\" is lame.
B004LWZW4W|4.0|This was the only Apes movie I saw in the series, and fittingly this is meant to happen first.  I don't have the other movies to reference, and I also don't have them to nitpick about something that may be missing, if there even is.  Since I am basing my review on this movie alone as a stand alone movie, and not a prequel or sequel, it may be a little different otherwise.  Graphics  I was so amazed at the CGI used in the movie.  At times, I was forgetting that I was looking at a computer image, rather than a real chimp.  The actor here, Mr. Serkis, is an amazingly talented individual when it comes to facial features, and being able to make computer generated characters seem more realistic than the human characters in the movies he is in.  Gollom, King Kong, and now this one really makes him a bona fide celebrity in my eye, though most people wouldn't recognize him if they saw him anywhere.  Not only Caesar, but the other CGI monkeys and other apes are perfectly executed.  Though I liked the human characters as well, the CGI definitely overshadowed their performances hands down.  Plot  The plot was so enthralling.  Delving into themes in the same facet of Frankenstein, where trying to use genetics and science to play some sort of God, really resonated with me.  I went with my cousin, and he wasn't able to get past the hokey parts or seeing the apes talk.  I was in complete rapture at the transformation of Caesar, and just like the Joker character in Dark Knight left me begging for more, though he was in it a heck of a lot more than Joker was.  It was interesting to see him shun his friends to team up with previous enemies in order to take control of the situation.  The movie seemed long in the theaters, and I don't know if it was because I was simply tired before going to it, or if it truly was a long movie.  It took quite a bit of time to build up to the climax, and not all of it was tedious, though some of it surely was.  I was not lacking, I do not believe, because I had not seen the previous installments and was able to keep up with the plot simply enough without it.  Because this was meant to be the origin, I think that definitely helped in that aspect.  It did, however, make me want to see the others to see if anything would be cleared up in any way.    All in all, this is a great movie experience.  If you like a good story, it's there.  If you like good action, It's there. If you like enhancing graphics, it's definitely there.    This movie seemed to have something for every movie lover out there, so grab the popcorn and enjoy the ride.

B0038W0OIK|3.0|I've had this headset for about 6 months and I've loved it.  But now the cable seems to have problems.  Sound will go to pure mono and I can get stereo back only if I wiggle the cable just right.  I thought these cables were supposed to be durable!!!!!!  There is an entry on the steelseries FAQ ([...]) saying they know about this problem and will replace your cables.  I just submitted a ticket, so I hope it works out.  But just be aware that this problem is quite likely!  If they send me the cable fast and it works for a long time, I'll still be happy with the purchase.  Even if they have to send me a new cable every 6 months, I would still prefer to use this headset.  I'm just afraid they will eventually stop supporting this product.

B002ZG981E|5.0|If any of you have ever watch Inception, you know how intricate the movie is and the enjoyment you'll get trying to understand everything, and the confusion. For the current sale's price on this movie is amazing. I don't know about all the other buyers out there, but I bought the movie for around 8 bucks on amazon when it was on sale. But when I opened the movie case I was surprised to see this wasn't the 2 disc Blu-ray pack, but instead it was the 2 disc blu-ray with a regular dvd movie and a digital copy. Don't know if it was a mistake, but happy with that purchase.

038572179X|4.0|The book is divided into three parts -- four, if you count the little meta coda at the end.  The first part, a hot summer night, is terrific, once you get into the slow rhythm of it, the Rashomon-like shifting of viewpoints.  What I expected, I think, was that we would then be shifted years into the future and we would get another immersion into stream of consciousness.  The themes would be there, the story and the characters, but they wouldn't be spelled out.    Instead, the author seemed to lose focus.  There was a different narrative tone.  Even, ugh, foreshadowing.    And the meta-messages.  OK, the characters aren't real and the plot is made up.  You're just messing with me, making me care.  I get it.  That's why they call it fiction.  And critiquing your own work, in the work itself -- mmmph.  Don't protect yourself with all these layers of self-consciousness.  Just ... do it.  That said, it remains a powerful book -- very funny in places, and shot through with little eye-opening observations and twists.  For my money, you should see the movie they made of it.  Not instead of.  First read the book.  But the movie is amazingly faithful.    And a certain actress comes in for a cameo at the end and it's like, \\"OK, this is how it's done.\\"  All the intellectual message, all the bite -- but she also brings the feeling.  Honest feeling.  Takes an ending that felt like something of a cheat, frankly, when I read it.  And makes it make sense.

157421327X|4.0|This a new type of art to try and I have started to collect this series of Zentangle books. I believe this the first in the series and it was so interesting. I had never tried anything quite like this and it is so easy. It offered many \\"tangle\\" patterns and I just think it is so much fun to mix up the patterns into a new \\"Zentangle\\" Image. It is very meditative and can be very beautiful when completed. I have framed some of my Zentangles and given as gifts. The person was so pleased with the gift. I was proud of what I had done, with the help of instructions from this book. It is well written and the instructions are clear. Anyone who can control a pen on paper, will not have a problem, so pretty much anyone can do this. I've never met anyone who did not love the look and wanted to know about it. Give it a try and Enjoy!
B001UV4XJ2|1.0|Digital copies, even Ultraviolet Digital Copies (like that in Cowboys & Aliens) used to mean you could download it to your iPad, which is my exact use case for digital copies. Why would I want to watch a Digital Copy at my computer, when I've got the DVD and Blu-Ray??? And if I'm watching on the move, do I want to use 10% of my entire month's bandwidth over 3G? Will it even look good that way? No, I want a copy in iTunes so I can transfer it over a wire, and let my girls watch it in the van. Like the dozens of other movies I do this with.  Be very careful of the Digital Copy brand, and especially this silly Ultraviolet version. To watch two movies this way I had to create THREE different accounts (one with Flixster, one with Ultraviolet, and one with Universal). And in the shuffle I seem to have lost the promised free one.  Definitely avoid this. Buy a version without digital copy, the movie's good, but this flavor of Digital Copy is terrible.  And I mean that in a nice way. :)

B0068TJLSY|1.0|They focus way to much on making us try to care about the characters, and fail. First 20 minutes of the movie could be deleted. The movie is 80% about some kids making a movie and the romantic connection between two of the kids. When E.T. goes home in the end, we're supposed to care and be happy for it. Fail. Very slow moving movie.
1455816795|4.0|Bought this for a long cross country trip for my husband and I to break up the driving.  It was very entertaining and the fact that it used a whole radio troupe and orchestra added to the interest.  It is probably geared to a more youthful adience but we had both enjoyed the book when we were young and enjoyed the cd.  It wasn't as long as some audio tapes but still worth the money.

Open your eyes people, it is wise to accept the life as it is, with its bad and good sides, and idiotic to live in your ideal puritan bubble. Life is not only black and white.  And not every show, movie, documentary, book, song, .... is for kids.   Sit back, relax and enjoy it for what it is. Don't like it? Move on.
0307591549|5.0|Shawn Achor brings together a lot of recent research on the relationship between happiness and success to make the case that happiness comes first and then success.  The earlier convention was that you became happy after achieving something - a career goal, owning a home or some other objective.  But people are often not happy after these achievements, or only momentarily happy.  It's people who are happy to begin with, argues Achor, that then achieve the successes they seek, and, if they are already happy, maintain that happiness and move on to other goals and objectives.  The research out there bears all this out - increases in income only provide significant happiness boosts up to a point, humans are very bad at predicting how happy or sad they will be after an event, etc.  Achor provides a helpful list of strategies to get happy first, like maintaining a social network, looking for the positive (and avoiding learned helplessness), and maintaining an attitude of gratitude.  Achor builds on the work from the maturing field of positive psychology and uses the tenets from that discipline to bolster his advice.  Achor is a also a very funny writer and self-deprecating, and I found myself laughing out loud on more than one occasion. I was also impressed by Achor's courage as he embarked on consulting businesses in the happiness principles right after the financial collapse of 2008.  He seemed to be always dealing with clients who had just learned of major losses and firings, and he managed to present his material with good success.  This is a great book for anyone who wants to build their success from the proper foundation of happiness.

0670022411|3.0|There were so many enthusiastic reviews of this book, and so much press and buzz that I was ecstatic to get my hands on an advanced copy of this book.  It's nothing special. It's way too long, as a matter of fact I did something I have never done, I put the book aside somewhere around page 200 and read another book. I eventually came back to it, and somewhere around page 300 it became somewhat captivating so I finished it. I skimmed the last 75-100 pages because it unfortunately became banal, again.  The story involves a witch, though she is somewhat of a closet witch, who while researching in Oxford comes across a book that is of great interest to all sorts of creatures. She at the same time comes into contact with a very handsome and old vampire.  THe problem with this book is that the story is all over the place. I still don't know why anyone would want Ashmole 782, why we must sit through pages of descriptions of yoga ( I have nothing against yoga) or pages and pages describing tea making or Matthew's hair. This books seems written by a high school student not a supposedly respected historian. In her afterward the author says \\"this is a book about books..\\" what books? THis is a copy of Ann Rice, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and harlequin romances. The middle part, which involves some historical characters, some nicely written characters (like Matthew's mother) and quite a bit of action and suspense, and a bit of romance, are quite readable, but I still don't know why this story took 600 pages to tell.  The other problem I have is the gratuitous historical references, none of which lead to anything, they are just thrown in to remind us the author is a historian.  It's a nice love story, and there are some interestingly written characters, but the story goes absolutely nowhere, and the writing is not captivating enough to make the trip worthwhile.

B002ZG99G8|1.0|The Loser is absolute garbage as far as I'm concerned.    The beginning will have you convinced you're about to see a spectacular action flick when you see a jeep carrying children *barely* avoid a huge explosion and come crashing down a cliff, and as soon as the helicopter lifts the kids up in the air and explodes (which actually offers fairly emotional writing much to my surprise) you're probably thinking \\"Okay, this is SURELY going to be awesome\\" but... the excitement ends there and you have 90 more minutes of crappy writing left.  First of all none of the main characters are remotely interesting.  They try to be funny.  They're not.  They try to be smooth talkers.  They're not.  They try to be tough guys.  They're not.  They're nothing but major annoyances the entire time.  They're also incredibly generic and forgettable.  The writing is absolutely horrid.  I realize the Losers is intended to be a campy action film so I shouldn't take the writing seriously, but when it gets to the point that nothing on screen offers anything in the way of interest and that it's impossible to care about any of the fighting or plotline building segments, it's time to shut this film off.  I can't watch movies like these that offer nothing at all.  A movie that never should have been made, period.  I'm sorry.

B002I0J5FG|5.0|Synopsis-  The opening story is somewhat obscure in terms of location, time period, and some other small things. You have a cloud of wonder throughout the game, but one solid goal you are fully aware of. In the first opening minutes of gameplay you take an unconcious maiden who has been cursed to an alter in the middle of nowhere. After revealing his ancient sword a booming voice tells the man that he has the ability to unlock the power to possibly to save the maiden. He must simply destory the 16 statues found in the temple. Ah, but the catch is one cannot simply walk into mord---, one cannot simply break the statues by mortal means; only by slaying the guardian of the land it represents. The voice tells the man that the cost of saving this woman may be of great value. \\"Anything to save her,\\" like a true hero, well spoken in his demeanor. The voice tells him to go east and after traversing the terrain and getting used to the controls, you reach an open field, and slowly walking by is what obviously the game revolves around; a colossus. You whip out your bow and get his attention as he slowly turns around, a health bar appears that you barely even scratch, and he walks towards you while raising his club - and this is where you know this is going to be an epic adventure.    More found here!  [...]/ - Bert's Chronicles of Obsessive Gaming = BCOOG  No ads! Clean simple review.
B005HXGE9G|5.0|I have always been a Peter Gabriel fan, to the point of really only appreciating his participation in Genesis' pushing the limits; his departure was missed but his solo career clearly expresses how creatively stiffled he apparently was with Genesis. I saw him perform this past week on David Letterman and before the show was over had ordered the double CD and am so glad I did! I am an electronic musician as well and will be the first to state how much I love technology, synths, and the evolution of analog to digital and now the digital trying to emulate the analog--indeed interesting times; however, Peter Gabriel's \\"New Blood\\" is a beautifully orchestrated (real instruments here), that actually emphasize how Peter Gabriel's voice is an instrument full of so much expression--even shedding new light on the lyrics with \\"New Blood\\". This is NOT an \\"unplugged-type\\" production as you can tell Gabriel has meticulousy worked with this orchestra and am so glad opted to purchase the two CD with the second CD being ONLY the \\"New Blood Orchestra\\" in exact order the vocal CD plays. Simply a beautiful CD and a must-have for Peter Gabriel fans and certainly hope I can catch this tour! Buy this!

B005DMNS4A|5.0|This rock opera blows Tommy away.  If I owned only one album this would be it.  Pete Townsend's masterpiece runs the full gamut of emotions.  Though this album does have many memorable songs, this is a complete work that takes the listener on a journey and begs to be listen to from start to finish.  Pete Townsend's work explores a young british man's disillussionment and disenfranchisement as well as his isolation and despair on his path of self discovery before it ultimately explodes into the best example of The Who's raw power.  Everything there is to love about The Who is on full display in this recording whether it's Daltry's booming vocals, Entwhistle's driving bass, Moon's frantic pounding drums or Townsend's song writting genius.
0525423656|4.0|If I could I would have given this book 4.5 stars. Didn't quite love it, but enjoyed it more than \\"like.\\" It is true that Condie waxes poetic through her characters more in this book than in Matched, which tends to slow down the plot; however, the plot was still good. If you are one who enjoys peeling back the layers of meaning and symbolism in a story or one who likes to just sit back and enjoy a story without being hit over the head with metaphors then you'll enjoy this series. Condie definitely has metaphors woven into Cassia's tale, yet I don't feel like she blatantly forces her metaphorical dilemma.   I would have liked more adventure, and felt more empathy for the characters when they experienced tragedies. I also missed Xander's presence in this book. He made one appearance, then the rest was a mentioning of him through Cassia's and Ky's memories. I did enjoy getting to know Ky more in this book. Though still a mystery, I understand his behavior and his love for Cassia better, but I didn't feel the compassion for him that I did in Matched. Consequently, I empathize with Xander much more even though he has now become the mysterious one. I hope Condie reveals more of him in the the next book. Cassia has grown stronger during her search for Ky. She has learned more about herself that she would have if she hadn't gone searching for him. While still naive she is discovering her strength which I like. Hopefully she does not fall apart in the next book when the heat turns up. I want her to be strong yet feminine, determined yet sympathetic, decisive yet compassionate.  With all that said, the book is really good. I can't wait for the next one!
B00003CXC7|5.0|I rank this among some of the best Hitchcock films (Vertigo, Lady Vanishes, Rebecca), though it's a slightly different feel than many of his other films.<br /><br />Basically Jimmy Stewart is holed up in his apartment with a broken leg.  He is a professional photographer, so he likes to look at things.  In the course of staring out at the neighbors from his window, he believes he witnesses a murder.  He enlists the help of a detective friend, his visiting nurse, and his girlfriend.<br /><br />Like Lady Vanishes, the viewer is not really given any real clues if there was even a crime, or what happened.  So the viewer is not really given any privy information.  We follow along as a casual observer, given only the same amount of information as Jimmy Stewart has.<br /><br />It's an interesting film that is not only about a possible homicide, but it's about the neighbors and their seemingly ordinary lives.  Though we don't really see any interaction between the main characters and the neighbors, we get to know the neighbors, as Jimmy Stewart does, by viewing them through their windows.<br /><br />It's a wonderful and original film that is beautifully shot and well acted.  Jimmy Stewart is amazing as usual and Grace Kelly lives up to her name (Grace-fully).<br /><br />A great film, top notch!  The restoration is good, but I would have liked some more extra features.  Perhaps one day Criterion will get their hands on this film and do a really A+ restoration with oodles of extras.  Until then, this is about the best you can find, and it's a solid release of a wonderful film.

082300659X|5.0|For anyone who got their degree in the 90's when art schools were pushing abstract as its premier genre; and had wanted dared to pursue realism - this is the book to go for.  The author keeps one engaged with informative yet lively dialogue of classical terms and forms.  If you were to have one book and one book only on classical realism, this is the one to go for.  Included is a DVD meant to supplement the information in this book.  Excellent read, wonderful descriptive lessons!

And can think like a logician. And practice legerdemain like a magician.<br /><br />In \\"11/22/63\\" King is and does all that and proves again he's above all a master storyteller. His new thousand-page alternate time story plays around with reality with as much ease and skill as a spider spins a web.<br /><br />Jake Epping is a high school teacher in a Maine backwater who's introduced to a \\"rabbit hole,\\" a time portal entered through a storeroom in the town diner that transports him back to 1958 and a mission to prevent JFK's assassination five years hence.<br /><br />Epping takes a new name and as George Amberson experiences life differently and finds love all over again in mid-century America in the time of Kresge's, Aqua-Velva, Burma Shave and a place with the Lindy Hop, hot rods and soda fountains - and don't forget the menace and things supernatural that you'd expect of King.<br /><br />Traveling to what Epping calls the \\"Land of Ago\\" has rules. A few nifty literary devices give King the ability to manipulate the story like a puppet master.<br /><br />Epping can travel back and forth through the rabbit hole but each time he goes back he's transported to Sept. 9, 1958 at exactly 11:58 a.m. Whenever he returns to 1958, anything that had been altered the previous trip back is reset, and anything that had been changed needs to be redone.<br /><br />No matter how long Epping had been gone, days, months, years, only two minutes have elapsed when he returns to the present.<br /><br />Time in this alternate-time universe is \\"obdurate.\\" The past doesn't like to be changed and it resists attempts to alter events. The resistance to change is proportionate to how much the future might be altered. Time's stubborn resistance to change in alt-time can be gruesome, even catastrophic.<br /><br />The rules of traveling to the \\"Land of Ago\\" give King freedom to explore some important aspects of living. He takes on the permanence of love, destiny and the pure randomness of the universe. Our hero can't complete his quest and confront evil until he discovers what really happened on Nov. 22, 1963 and then figure out what might today be like if history is reset.<br /><br />If you're hesitant to pick up the book because time travel to you means a lot of mumbo-jumbo, that's reason enough to read what King has accomplished. The book is epic in scope, genre-bending in approach and story telling at its best. I opened it hoping to be entertained.

It's still low-resolution 16 bit old technology.<br />I don't see why they don't release a TRUE \\"Deluxe Edition\\" and give us an SACD (and not the over-priced BS SHM-SACDs... what a gimmick) as they did with the release of Emerson, Lake, and Palmer's Brain Salad Surgery. It's phenomenal and a TRUE \\"Deluxe Edition\\".
B004RSCWZ2|5.0|Revelator is a great album. I've had this album for almost six months, and still look forward to listening to it.<br /><br />Susan Tedeschi has the most beautiful soulful voice. I love her midrange tone and how her voice flows so perfectly with Derek Truck's slide guitar.<br /><br />There is some amazing guitar playing on this disc. Trucks is a master at the slide guitar. The rest of the band fills in perfectly.<br /><br />The album is a mix of styles, blues, rock, funk, and ballads. Some of the songs are a bit over produced or too smooth, these are deep multi track recordings. Some of the tracks would be better with some rough more live performance edges.<br /><br />My only complaint about the album, I like my music with a little angst. Tedeschi is very happy right now; she and Trucks have a great relationship and have found a comfortable groove. To me, if there's blues in the music, well it shouldn't be that happy. For a few of the songs I can picture Tedeschi gazing lovingly at Trucks and him back at her. The picture is a little too sweet.<br /><br />I think Susan Tedeshi's 2008 album, Back To The River, is a better album. It is darker, and her voice shines much better than in Revelator. I love the struggle in her voice on Back To The River. ([[ASIN:B001HADFHW Back to the River [Vinyl]]])<br /><br />I do enjoy Revelator. Tedeschi and Trucks are fantastic musicians.
0395925037|3.0|The time is 11:11pm, and right now, as it is pitch black and cold out, the time to review this book feels just right....    First off, I am going to make a category as to weather or not I recommend you read this book, please identify which category you best fit in.    YOU SHOULD/CAN READ THIS BOOK IF YOU:    - Have a basic understanding and basic, no lie complete truth education as to what really happened in the second World War. If you studied World War Two even briefly and your parents taught you right from wrong, you should have no problems reading this book.    YOU SHOULD NOT READ THIS BOOK IF:    -You are the faint of heart and cannot tolerate any forms of racial remarks or profiling.    -You DON'T know a thing about World War II, because at times if you read this and feel like you are siding with Hitler, I would recommend you place the book down immediately and watch the History Channel or the Military Channel.    As stated above, if you feel like after you read some of Hitler's remarks and say \\"Jeez, this guy is starting to make me side with him\\". Please place the book down and continue on to something else. Also, if you find yourself in that category, you can stop reading this review now. Thanks, and happy trails.    Now, to the people who fit in the first category and want to read this book, please make note before reading:    Technically, this is not Hitler's autobiography. While at some parts he does mention his past, family, upbringing and so on and so forth, the book and whole is his thoughts on politics and how Germany essentially got \\"screwed over\\" after the First World War. The book contains rants, political thoughts, autobiographical pieces, and a few others, but in whole, the book is rantings and political thoughts of a mad man. If you are studying Hitler, there are hundreds of biographies on the man. I would recommend reading one of those and then reading this to get the whole picture if you will.    Also, this book was written in the mid to late 1920's, before any of the terrible events unfolded in World War II, so no, while Hitler clearly expresses his hate of the Jewish people, it does not mention the Holocaust or anything as the event had yet to begin. Hitler wrote this while in prison for his \\"political\\" beliefs (and I use the term \\"political beliefs\\" very sparingly considering the horrendous and inexcusable acts that occurred in Nazi Germany.    Now, on to the review:    First off, I would probably recommend a different version of Mein Kampf. While the Ralph Manheim translation which I own is okay, there are noticeable spelling errors in parts that could confuse the reader. I bought this copy because it was all they had at Border's when they were closing.     Hitler was not a genius, contrary to popular belief of some. He did seem genius at times, but in all of the wrong places, like convincing a people of a religion to come to Germany to find work and instead they were killed. Not cool. Hitler rose to power because in the post-war Wiemar Republic, the economy was in absolute shambles (The Mark, the currency of Germany, worthless. And no, not like a penny worthless, it was literally sold as wastepaper rather than used as money.) The Treaty of Versailles bankrupted Germany and unemployment was rampant. According to many, Hitler was a great speaker, although I am sure if a lab mouse went up to the podium before Hitler and said \\"employment opportunities for all!\\" The people of Germany probably would have followed the mouse. Not that they are stupid in the least, but at a time when turmoil was the only thing around, if anybody had a plan, they were essentially tricked into following them, like they followed Hitler.    Essentially, the book is just one big rambling of a mad man. Clocking in at about 380 pages, it is not very long, but literally if someone went on a big rant and wrote it all down, their rant would be like this book. Since you are reading this review because you have basic knowledge of theSecond World War, you know what Hitler hated and his political views, and really they are all gathered in one place.    I would not recommend reading this book in public, like the train station, airport, park, etc. as you are sure to get a look, even if you were just reading it to see how long one man's hate and sideways political views could go on. Read it in your study, with a nice pipe and a roaring fire, then maybe throw it in the fire afterwords.    On a final note, it is not really that bad of a book if you have the basic knowledge to understand Hitler, but at times it is certainly stodgy, dull and generally outright boring. Read at your own risk.    S.O.
B005STGJEO|5.0|Chulahoma is The Black Keys take on songs by the blues genius Junior Kimbrough. This 180 gram vinyl picture album is really sweet.<br /><br />The vinyl is a perfect pressing. Fat Possum is spotty with their vinyl pressings, sometimes they are perfection, and other times there are silly flaws. In this case, they did a stellar job. The album is perfectly flat and centered, and free of any pops or background noise. The artwork in the vinyl is just the coolest darn thing in the world - its psychedelic watching the thing spin on the turntable.<br /><br />This is a simple album, a clear plastic envelope with stickers and the album. There is no cardboard, no inner sleeves, no paper inserts. Given that the plastic sticks so tightly to the album (the envelope just looks toxic), I'm going to store the album in an archival sleeve.<br /><br />I've owned this album on CD for four years; I love the music and am very familiar with the CD sound. The vinyl is a whole new world of sound on this album, I've gotten so used to the CD sound, and this just opened up my eyes a ton.<br /><br />The music is a bit debatable; do true blues fans find it offensive that Patrick and Dan have switched up Kimbrough's melodies and instrumentation? Or is this a fresh take on American roots music? I fall squarely in the latter camp. I like what The Black Keys have done to this music. I find it interesting that this deep blues influence is so apparent in the other albums The Black Keys have done (even though the thread is getting thin, there is still a hint of blues in El Camino).<br /><br />The real validation for me is the voice mail from Kimbrough's wife, saying Junior would have been proud to hear them do this music. Thankfully, they included that recording as the last song on the second side of the album. If I'm quick, I can get up and stop the album before I have to listen to that track over and over (it was long ago deleted from my digital library).<br /><br />I've started listening to the original blues albums by Kimbrough, David Honeyboy Edwards, and RL Burnside. I think The Black Keys have paid a great homage to those amazing musicians. The blues lives on and moves forward with what they are doing.al blues albums by Kimbrough, David Honeyboy Edwards, and RL Burnside.

B005H0IW6W|5.0|It's nice to hear someone perform songs in the classic style, not try to overly vocalize or 'pop' them up. Some songs are meant to be sung as they were intended.   I don't understand the reviewers who are upset because this isn't Michael Buble's 'sound'.    I don't understand the reviewers who feel that he's 'sold out'.  Has anyone heard him talk about this album? He recorded it the way he did because he wanted to make a holiday album like those that so many of us grew up with (himself included). What's wrong with that? Absolutely nothing.   The entire album is good, some songs better than others, but all good. My husband and I think that Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas is one of the best versions we've ever heard.  Usually I don't care for Feliz Navidad, but I actually like the version on this cd. As for Shania Twain, well, you can't win them all. I'd prefer to hear White Christmas without her added vocalizations.  If you want popped up versions of holiday songs, go look some place else. This isn't the cd for you. If you want old style with a Michael Buble twist, look right here.
B004EPZ08E|2.0|Quick review of the movie - my wife and I loved it, absolutely hillarious!  We bought this addition because the packaging clearly says Digital Copy.  A digital copy it is not!  You can stream it to a computer, iPhone, etc. after a laborious process, but you have to have WIFI or cell coverage.  So much for watching a movie on the plane!  As this was the first Ultraviolet movie we purchased, I consider it false advertising.  At least more recent releases now display Ultraviolet instead of Digital Copy on the top bar of the packaging.  A type of packaging I will avoid from now on!

B000ATQYT2|5.0|Michael Caine plays the best Scrooge I've ever seen.  Others make Scrooge seem mean.  Michael makes him seem more sad and regretful, and I can more easily relate to that character.  You almost feel a sympathy for Scrooge, which I feel is more true to life.  Also, as with everything Muppets, they bring an element of humor into this version, while still keeping very close to the original script.  The emotional range of this movie is quite captivating and enjoyable.  The scenery and soundtrack are beautiful, the acting brilliant, and the choices of actors excellent (yes, there are real people involved here, not just Muppets).  Our family has watched this every year for over a decade now.  A classic.
B001E75QH0|5.0|painless purchase and a quick ship. I have no complaints at all! I have waisted alot of gas driving to the mall and the \\"superstores\\" to find this item with no luck. I found this purchase online and saved alot of money compared to what I would have spent at a regular store.

B005D9B26E|3.0|Alright then. This isn't actually a review as such. I haven't and will not buy this. Reason being very simple. Pete, Rog, MCA and everyone involved, have been gouging people like me for years, and I'm done. Full disclosure: I didn't buy \\"Leeds\\" with the suddenly (LOL) discovered Hull set, either.<br />I'll tell you all why. I have owned everything these guys have done multiple times. Vinyl, cassette, CD, and remastered CD's. I paid for all of them with my, at the time, meager earnings. Way back in the 90's, when the remasters started to emerge, I sold my entire catalogue to help finance spending 20 bucks apiece for the whole damned history yet again. And while I was happy with the 'extras', it was not announced that some of the material was 'remixed' as well as 'remastered', so some familiar (to me) vocal/guitar lines were now jarring against my memory of them.<br />But, OK, maybe they just felt like improving them, to their tastes.<br />The bit by bit re-releases of new 'completist' versions of \\"Who's Next\\" and \\"Leeds\\" started to piss me off. How many times was I going to have to pony up 20-40 bucks more for what was left off of the last 'Complete' version I bought 5 years prior?<br />Which brings us to the $140.00 \\"Quadrophenia\\".<br />Since I've gone on long enough, I'll keep it simple, but all true Who diehards will know exactly what I'm talking about.<br />For $140, you aren't going to include the sessions outtakes/nonreleases that appeared on the 1979 soundtrack disc? You know, The Who's recordings of \\"Joker James/Get out\\", whatever else they did, etc, etc.<br />FAIL.<br />Three stars because I love the material, always have.<br />I'm not spending $140.00 on what is an OBVIOUSLY incomplete 'package' of Quadrophenia.<br />We don't get fooled again!

B005ZCXFD2|1.0|Sorry but like others I found none of the characters likable in this movie. A bunch of thug kids mug a girl and then get attacked by aliens. Bad writing, bad acting, ... There are movies where you root for the bad guys. This wasn't one of them.  I almost get the impression this was made by some thug kids for the rest of their thug friends. I'm sure in that case it's an awesome movie but not for the rest of us.
0793573742|5.0|I got this book basically because I love Micheal Bloomfield and his 59 Les Paul. I wanted to know more about the amazing tone he had. I really had no idea that the 59 Bursts were so diverse. Not like these days where you can see a rack of ten matching guitars at the store. Each one of these has its own distinct personality, its own face and no doubt, its own voice. This book captures the uniqueness that is the 59 Burst, explains them in great, but not overwhelming detail. Excellent detail and explaination of the construction process. The photography is amazing. I meant to buy this in hard cover, and after seeing the photos, I will. I know that my friends (who aren't into music and guitars like I am) will pick up this book and look through it just as they would any art book on my coffee table. Well worth the money.   One problem - It makes me want a 59 so much more now!
0385341008|1.0|I was really looking forward to reading this book, after hearing all the rave reviews. Plus I love books about wartime Britain and especially, books about books. I was hoping for a fictional \\"84 Charing Cross Road.\\" But I found this book to be exceptionally dull and trite with very wooden characters. The authors were  trying to have them  sound like chipper PG Wodehouse types, but they were unsuccessful.  Even though there are many different letter writers, which was confusing enough, all of them wrote with the same voice. They were all very glib, even the \\"simple Guernsey folk.\\" I gather it was supposed to be amusing, but the story came across as silly. I just didn't care about any of these characters or the \\"hilarious\\" stories they were telling.  I almost didn't finish it, but I had to read it for my book group. Very disappointing.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|It is a good bargain and will watch the movie during the Xmas holiday during a break.  Supposed to be a Christmas present.  Guess what?  Hubby found it and what is it doing tthere.  He want to watch it and told him - wait for after Christmas Day!<br /><br />Merry Christmas!!
B005IZLPKQ|5.0|This is the best movie I've seen in a long time. Amazing. Hollywood finally gets it right. No swearing. No gore. No sex. No drugs.

B000YAA68C|5.0|Cleverly written and beautifully acted, this movie would appeal to just about anyone, I think.  I give it 4 stars instead of 5 because of the Yankee stadium scene.  There are a couple of scenes that were deleted that I think would have made it a better film if they had been included instead of the Yankee stadium scene.  Hillary Swank is great in this movie and she's not alone.  The entire cast was fantastic.  This movie runs the gamut of emotional highs and lows.  It is funny and tragic, devastating and hopeful.  You will not go wrong by deciding to watch this one.  On second thought, I'm gonna five it 5 stars because I enjoyed it so much.  Even with the scene I think could have been done much better.  :)
B006C5FWH8|4.0|Old school turn-based rpg. I like it a lot and the last update brought more missions... it has a lot of potential. I hope to see more campaigns, more varied graphics, more equipment (with a way to sell used equipment) and more variety of enemies in the future. In short, I want more!
B006BXT4TI|5.0|I am not prone to writing reviews. And I'll admit that my experience with the Black Keys started with their last effort, \\"Brothers\\". Whatever your experience level with the band, this album is a must for your collection. It's a rare, rare thing when you buy an album that doesn't have at least 2 or 3 clunkers on it. And more often than not, albums have a few good songs and everything else is a clunker. Just to listen to Mayer Hawthorne's most recent release to experience the perfect example of an album that has a couple good songs and bunch that barely qualify as filler. El Camino will rock you from start to finish. Just jump in the car and crank this thing up. If you don't find your hands drumming along on the steering wheel to Patrick Carney's rhythms on Lonely Boy,Gold on the Ceiling, Sister, & Stop Stop, you're beyond help. In fact, check your pulse because you may be dead. Top to bottom, there are no bad tracks on this record. It's definitely my favorite release this year.

B005MYEQ9U|5.0|Aristotle wrote that Tragedy is about a great mind living a reversal of fortune, because an inner drive (not external events) drives him/her towards self-knowledge and death: the performance must offer aesthetic pleasure. Anna Bolena fits the definition as few other operas can ever hope to (except of course when they are transcriptions of Sophocles, Shakespeare, Racine, and a very few others). No weepy drama, no red eyes when Bolena is judicially murdered. Felice Romano is a great poet! I am not a native speaker of Italian, but I do have the privilege of speaking a Latin Language. If you can, learn Italian, the payoff is huge. The plot is reasonably faithful to history, but that is irrelevant: it unveils a totally different, totally convincing vista: the hypothetical face-to-face conflict between Boleyn on her way to the scaffold and Seymour on hers to the throne. In real life it probably never happened; actually the real Jane Seymour was a simple lowly educated country girl. Giovanna Seumour is a Felice Romano character. But if you enjoy a truly mega-conflict of noble minds seek no further! Then there is the music. At his best, Donizetti is one to beat and here he is at his absolute peak best. The Wiener Statsoper, under Maestro Pidò has been lavishly praised by others and I remember no other performance as good as this one. This is a brave new world of sound, the rendering of a complex elegant score, at one time dark and brilliant. Anna Netrebko remarked during a recent interview that Boleyn must have been quite a lady to make a king change the religion of an entire country \\"simply\\" to be able to marry her. So, said Netrebko, Bolena must die gloriously as the great Queen she was. Her madness is not lunacy like Lucia's, because it has method in it: she simply wonders back to her happy days, before walking to the scaffold. It is a historical fact that Boleyn died greatly. Anna's Bolena dies tragically and magnificently. I was not privileged to witnes La Callas, butI have her CD. She is definitive, but Anna is another of the wonders of the world. She may not have the coloratura agility but this is really immaterial. Here is Her Majesty, a Tragedy, as great as they come. When she solemnly declares  \\"Cessa! A questa iniqua accusa mia dignità riprendo!\\" you feel instinctively you should kneel. The voice is velvety dark (when was it anything else?) and how wonderfully does this reflect the great mind experiencing reversal of fortune. Then of course, there is Elina Regina Seymour. Whenever on stage, in farce, comedy or drama, Elina is never less than phenomenal. We have Roberto Alagna's word that she is the most complete Carmen. Her Giovanna Seymour is definitive. Her Majesty is exquisite, her acting brilliant but her timbre is out of this world. The legendary Bolena / Seymour duet, possibly one of the greatest moments in the history of music, is sung and acted but two very different, contrasting voices and actresses: verdict has to be, it has never been done this way before. Bravo to Donizetti and Romano who created this textual and musical marvel, bravissimo for Pidó and his Wienners, but on you knees for Anna and Elina. Elizabeth Kulman is a great Smeton: first time I heard or saw her: she raises it to the higher level, sings and acts beautifully, and completes the ladies' dominant role in this production. The trouble in the plot (and in history) is how to believe that even a young Flemish musician could have been duped to confess what he did. The gentlemen are variable. Archangelo's Enrico is not sufficiently villainous. But everyone must make way for their Majesties. Not having a Callas video is as sad as all the lost Greek tragedies, but this DVD is way ahead of everything else so far! I saw (and loved) the Met production live: Netrebko may have surpassed herself (is that really possible?), Elina and Pidò are head and shoulders higher, the Vienna gentlemen not as good, but I would like to have the Met DVD to compare. Let's hope it can match this Viennese glory. Not an easy order. If you like bel canto you must have this. A gripping story that runs before your eyes before you can take yourself away from it. Three hours in a few minutes.

I've always been a fan of Lost, but this episode didn't seem to have a ton of direction nor entertainment. It gets better in the next couple episodes...  Hurley and Jack in the lighthouse? I'd like those 5 minutes of my life back. I'm sorry if that seems harsh, still a fan, Jack just gets a little annoying.

0062060554|4.0|If this is this author's debut novel then I am excited for what comes next from S.J. Watson. Before I Go to Sleep is a quick and fast paced read and very hard to put down.  Christine Lucas suffers from amnesia and wakes every morning with no memory of anything that has happened to her previously. Each night as she sleeps she loses all of her memories, and with them her sense of self. Also, complicating things is the presence of Ben, whom Christine must be told is her husband each morning after waking in an unfamiliar bed, in an unfamiliar house, and in a much older body that she does not recognize as her own. From these tiny details Christine begins to work to reconstruct her past and make sense of how she ended up in her present condition.  The brilliance of Before I Go to Sleep is that the reader gets to follow along with Christine as she rediscovers her old and new self. With the help of Dr. Nash, who works to help Christine recover her memory in their secret meetings, while simultaneously conducting his own research on the effects of amnesia, Christine takes his advice and starts to record her thoughts and daily events in a journal. It is this journal which Christine reads every morning that becomes a living record of her past, and allows her to know certain truths about herself. However, once she begins keeping the journal Christine notices discrepancies between what her husband Ben tells her, and what she writes herself which includes information discussed with Dr. Nash. Thus, someone is lying, or simply telling their version of the truth, which leaves Christine in a difficult spot and unsure of who to trust.  Memory and its place in the lives of individuals can be sometimes overlooked and not given a high place of importance. But after reading this novel there is no question about the importance of one's memory, and that the ability to remember the past is integral to being a fully present and functioning person.
1577314808|5.0|I started reading this book nearly a year ago. It took me 1 week to read and I never felt bored which is a good thing as I don't finish most of the books I start reading. It's written in a crystal clear style and I found some of the passages quite difficult to digest and often had to start over on certain paragraphs and read very carefully in order to get the idea he was trying to convey.<br /><br />Some of the time I found myself totally mesmerized with the ideas Tolle puts forth, such as that time and death are both illusions. As I slowly read the book all these new ideas started to make some kind of vague sense to me. In one chapter entitled \\"The Inner Body\\" Tolle explains that our body (or what we think is our body) isn't real; \\"It isn't you\\" he explains. I never really understood this line until about 2 days ago I was having a shower and I suddenly had a revelation and I instantly knew what he meant by this. It was one of those fleeting moments and right now as I type this review this \\"knowing\\" that I felt at that time has gone. But even if I still had it, it would be impossible to put into words.<br /><br />Tolle also doesn't put too high a value on words or language as they are only \\"signposts\\" and don't represent the essence of what they point to. He doesn't use the word \\"God\\" very often because of the many preconceived images people have when they hear that word. He prefers to use more neutral words like \\"being\\" and \\"consciousness\\". The ultimate purpose of the book is moving into a permanent state of \\"being\\", which is achieved by focusing only on the present moment and giving it your full attention. He repeats this idea again and again and again throughout all the chapters and it really is the crux of the entire book. The recurring theme is to \\"stay present\\" .<br /><br />I deliberately didn't use any superlatives in this review because I feel it cheapens the value of \\"The Power Of Now\\", because it is the most valuable book anyone can own. It's written in away that is accessible, draws you in, then somehow taps into, and opens up, an undiscovered dimension to your life. I could literally feel this happening as I read it in silence and I felt the peace within.

B005IGVYUG|5.0|This is a really good record. The fans have to love it and it is easier on the ears for the \\"nonbelievers\\". I would say that the songs contain melodies more \\"understandable\\" for the general public. ¿Could this record be the \\"Raindogs\\" of this decade? It has beautiful songs.
B004EPYZQ2|5.0|When I told my mom about Super 8, I mentioned it was probably one of my favorite movies of the past several years. Then, I had her watch it. Her reaction was particularly funny, because she was thinking period drama, and Super 8 may be a period piece (1979) and it may be a drama (if a Science Fiction one), but it was certainly not what she meant...   Super 8 was a huge dose of nostalgia for the great movies I grew up with. Child actors who engage on a journey of excitement and growth - much like Goonies or ET.   In 1979 in a small town, there's a horrifying train crash. The train appears to have had something large and scary aboard!  Our heroes are a young filmmaker and his friends who are working on a zombie movie.   Like all sci-fi films, a suspension of one's disbelief is necessary - the train crash scene, while exciting and done really well, was so unrealistic in cause and effect, that one has to view it through a child's eyes.  Super 8 has some action, several scares, impressive special effects, a little bit of pre-teen romance, and some fabulous one-liners.   Written and directed by J J Abrams and Produced by Stephen Spielberg, I was expecting greatness, and I was not disappointed.  Oh, and if you're wondering, my mom thought the movie was really good, too.

B0061JPYX2|5.0|I love this CD by Amy Winehouse. \\"A Song For You\\" has been covered by some many artists, but Amy makes this song her own with her soulful vocals.  This is my favorite track.  \\"I Love You More Than You'll Ever Know\\" is such a good love song.  Amy's vocals are so sensual.  \\"Body and Soul\\" is the perfect song to listen to and relax to after a long stressful day.  This is a romantic duet with Tony Bennett.  Their voices sound great together.  \\"Before The Cheats\\" is a song about a wife telling her husband what she would do if he ever cheat on her. This song has a retro sound that I love.  \\"Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow\\" is a classic song.  I love the acoustic guitar playing arrangement here.  I have never heard this song performed like this.  It sounds beautiful.  \\"The Girl From Ipanema\\" has a smooth bossa nova tone.  This song gets me moving.  \\"Our Day Will Come\\" is a song that makes me believe that I will find that special woman to share my life with.  \\"Tears Dry\\" is another song about the difficulties in a  relationship between two people.  There is a wisdom and honesty in Amy's voice that sounds appealing. \\"Lioness\\" is Amy's finest work.

B001UV4XI8|5.0|This movie is fantastic and is a must-have for all Harry Potter fans. The Blu Ray graphics are great and I bought this for a very cheap price which made it even better. This movie is just the first part of the last installment of the Harry Potter movie series. I would say this movie is very dark compared to the others and so please be warned about small children watching this movie. However, it is a great movie for the family and a must-have for movie collectors who are into the Harry Potter series!
B004HO6I2E|5.0|Not too often do I see a movie twice in the theaters, but this is an exception.  This movie took me through just about all possible emotions.  Laughing my butt off in the first 40 seconds is a whole new record!  It's on my son's Christmas list this year!  (he's 18 y/o)
1451648537|4.0|Kudos to the author for covering the life of Steve Jobs in such a \\"short\\" space. Although I felt like I already knew Steve personally, through my use of Apple products and following his career through the years, this book rounded out my understanding. I'm hoping the \\"official\\" movie version of his life completes the picture for readers of this book.  One puzzling thing about this biography: It makes very little mention of the OS X operating system, which drastically changed the user experience when it was introduced a few years ago. Microsoft is still trying to copy it, to no avail.

014241493X|5.0|John Green is an amazing author. Once again he has written a book that is impossible to put down. He does an outstanding job of making his stories feel real. One moment you love the characters and the next you hate them. He humanizes his characters instead of making them into completely false and unobtainable characters.  If theses are attributes of a book you want to read, read this book! I fell in love with John Green while reading An Abundance of Katherines, my favorite, and was hooked with Looking for Alaska. I cannot wait for his newest installment coming in January.

B005K0HDGE|5.0|I haven't read anything by Stephen King since shortly after I graduated High School.  I enjoyed his writing back then, but I've since moved on to other things.  I read this book on the recommendation of a website I frequent and I have to say that I loved it.  Describing the book, however, is another matter.  It's not horror, but it is at times creepy.  It's not a love story, but then again... It's not science fiction, but it does involve time travel. It's not a political thriller, but then again it is - in a way.  All I can come up with is that it's a wonderful book.  Mr. King obviously put a lot of work into making the late 50s/early 60s feel real to the reader.  It's full of detail and that contributes to the realism.    It's an absolute page turner and a pleasure to read, but it defies classification.

B005OP71SK|4.0|This is a female Count of Monte Cristo plot. I believe the quote \\"Before you embark on a journey of revenge, dig two graves\\" and philosophically, I think revenge is bad for the heart. I'll guiltily admit I love watching revenge plots vicariously.    I am a fan of Madeleine Stowe; I am becoming a fan of Emily Van Camp.  Henry Czerny also makes a great bad guy a la Clear and Present Danger,  MI and now this show.   I started watching for the fun (Hamptons lifestyle & revenge) story, but I definitely keep watching for the clothes and the decor. As I mentioned in the title, I've looked for Emily's casual clothes online, but can't find them. They're beautiful.

B005HSG3TC|4.0|I do really like this case because of its compact size and durable protection, and I use the fold back feature to read all the time.  My only concern is since that part is a rubberized plastic and I don't know how well it will hold up to prolonged bending back and forth on a daily basis.  Overall the case is good, slim and can slide right into my purse with ease!  The price dropped $10 right after I ordered it and Amazon gave me a credit for that amount as well.  I love this site!

We have tried them on both of our HD sets and they they look really bad.  We even compared to an episode that was running at the same time on Directtv.   I would not purchase these again.  Not sure what is going on but the ones we got were terrible.  sorry.  I really Love NCIS.  Maybe someone knows where I might get them in Blueray.  I have looked but have  been unable to find a blue ray version.

B005HP2JAM|1.0|I didn't think anything could be very wrong when it said \\"Blu-ray 3D and Blu-ray in one disk\\". I was wrong. After starting and seeing the very long ads the movie started and 3 minutes in the sound stopped. Nothing could get it started. I put in another disk and everthing o.k., there is nothing on setup about selecting 3-D or plain 2-D just for subtitles. It may be my blu-ray player is to old, Samsung aged 3 years. I can't see any scratches or blemishes on the disk. I will not buy any 3-D combo disk until I am assured they will work in a 2-D player. It may be a bad disk or it may be the newest combo disk can't format on 3 year old dvd's. Be careful.

1577314808|2.0|Is it socially or personally advantageous to live exclusively in the NOW, as Tolle advocates? If farmers lived exclusively in the NOW, fields wouldn't get ploughed and crops wouldn't get planted. If cavemen lived exclusively in the NOW... we'd still be cavemen. Tolle purportedly sat on a park bench for two years after his \\"enlightenment.\\" That's nice I suppose, but living on the charity of others hardly strikes me as the pinnacle of human potential.<br /><br />What is Tolle's modus operandi for achieving NOWed-out bliss? Eliminate \\"dualistic\\" (whatever that means) thinking. As far as we know, it's taken the universe 4.5 billion years to evolve to a level where it can experience conscious thought... and all we want to do is turn it off?<br /><br />Two stars, because unlike some of the one star reviewers, I think Tolle is sincere; I don't think he's an outright charlatan. And this book may be helpful for someone who, like Tolle, experiences chronic psychological pain. Living in the NOW may be better than jumping off a bridge, but that hardly makes it the ideal state of affairs

B004Q7CIFI|5.0|One question...how do I access the video on my kindle fire?  As for a review...I loved this book.  It was detailed and expertly woven in a way I doubt anyone but King could do.  If you loved or even just LIKED his books you'll love this one.    I love that King finds a way to tie in other books that he's written like he's created a community you'd expect to find in your own real life.  I found two ties at least.  See if you can find them.  One will be very obvious if you're a fan and the other is subtle enough that you'll miss it if you're not looking for it.  A MUST READ'!!  :)
1451627289|2.0|When I heard about this book, the first thing I thought of was Ken Grimwood's [[ASIN:068816112X Replay]], which is one of my favorite novels.  I went to my bookshelf, read \\"Replay\\" again for at least the 5th time in the last 23 years and enjoyed it immensely.  The protagonist of that book is someone who returns to the past - his OWN past - and tried to stop Oswald from killing Kennedy.  The twist is certainly more interesting than that portrayed in King's novel.  That being said, there is definitely a story within Stephen King's behemoth of a tome.  Yet it is buried within a lot of detritus.  As someone who teaches children, I found the references to \\"Yellow Card Man\\" strange -- that kind of name sounds more like something that should be lodged in a Dr. Seuss book, not one by the horror master (whose books I read frequently 30 years ago as a teenager) Stephen King. And I was also interested in the passages about whether \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" belonged in the school library.  However, this book really needed some editing.  In the end, my own local library required that I return the book within a week.  As the story wasn't worth dropping everything to rush through it, I had to skip a good portion of the vast middle.  I read a large amount of literature for both professional and personal reasons.  And King's \\"Apt Pupil\\" short story (from his book [[ASIN:0451167538 Different Seasons (Signet)]] as well as his novel [[ASIN:0451161343 Thinner (Signet)]] would probably still scare me if I took the time to think about them.  King can certainly write.  However, I wonder if a lot of other readers will do the same that I did. To just eschew the detritus and just flip to the ending to see if King's hero gets Oswald and the world -- or at least America -- becomes a utopia (or not).    If you do like this story, I highly recommend Grimwood's \\"Replay.\\"  Unlike King's tale, the former's protagonist physically becomes a teenager again and realizes that he has the chance to \\"replay\\"his life.  The way he makes money is similar to Stephen King's character - and there is a love story as well.  And Grimwood manages to do this in a little more than 300 pages.  I wonder what Grimwood would think of \\"11/22/63.\\"  Unfortunately, he passed away awhile ago.
B0050QV0RQ|5.0|Even if I hadn't got this as a free app of the day I'd still rate it 5 out of 5.  I love the Final Fantasy-like nature of it.  I also love how the autosave occurs every time the screen changes; saved me a time or two when I got in over my head in a boss fight.  The only thing I don't like is not having some way to track the current quest(s) you're on at the time with little things like where you need to go next.  And maybe some side quests while you're running around to help you earn extra XP. Even with that you can re-explore areas you've already been to to get into fights but a side quest would be more entertaining.
0307279189|5.0|This is a great story about people, camaraderie, psychology and running!  It delves into lost cultures, people from different walks of life and ties them all together into a fascinating tale.  It is predominantly about the Tamahumara people and a guy called 'Caballo', however it weaves in an out of the ultrarunning culture as well as the Ancient Indian Tribe and ties it all together.  Great science, great story, great read.  Get it, you'll love it!  Very highly recommended (especially if you are a runner yourself. Guaranteed to inspire you to run if you aren't!!).  May your running be light and long....  :-)
B004VBAHG6|5.0|This is a fantastic album and a great example of his solo work. His haunting voice is still amazingly strong and the melodies are as thoughtful as they had been on past solo albums. I thought that \\"Unshattered\\" was going to be his last album as \\"Dust\\" was just too disappointing, but \\"Ninth\\" proves that he still has a lot of creativity left in him. I downloaded the MP3s and then bought the vinyl, something I only do for albums I think worthy of a warmer and richer sound. This album definitely deserves that.
B004EPYZSU|1.0|Jon Favreau should be put in director hell forever for making this POS movie. It's really only about \\"hey, let's all collect our checks\\" and screw the audience. I was speechless at the bad writing, acting, directing, you name it, a new low for Hollywood horrible! Harrison Ford is so laughable in his performance, might be the only saving grace, for an otherwise worthless effort.

B005UKJX4E|1.0|This movie was a total waste of time. I wanted to turn it off within 15 mins but thought if I only watched a little longer, everything would pull together (Pink Floyd...as a team - Shine On You Crazy Diamond). So...I watched and watched........until the end (Her Majesty's a very nice Girl). Then I'm scratching my head, my balls, my arm pits.....looking for a meaning.....OMG, I don't actually think with my penis 'cause I scratched my head first. What deep meaning! If only I could have felt so much of a religious experience watching this film! My favorite part was the film's ending. Hurrah! Want some advice? Drop some 1960's acid and listen to Pink Floyd, \\"Echoes\\" (Meddle Album), and imagine yourself in the Pompeii ruins, and watch a volcano heat lamp light. You'll be glad you did. We'll leave the light on for ya. ROFL.
B004LWZW4M|5.0|I saw Rise of the Planet of the Apes, on opening day, this past summer (2011). If you like the Planet of the Apes, with Charlie, more than likely you are going to love this DVD! I can't add anything else to what the other 5 Star Raters have said. I would have given it a possible 3.5 Star until the end of the movie. It went straight to a 5 Star! Excellent ending, for a new begining. I will be there for the Sequel!!! I'll have my ticket for \\"Opening Day!\\" 'nuff said!

B000OU5TOS|5.0|Nelson Mandela is one of the greatest political leaders of our time. In his autobiography Long Walk to Freedom, the world for the first time gets to hear in Mandela's own words the events of his life; from childhood, through his 27 year imprisonment, to his triumphant victory over apartheid in South Africa.  Mandela not only led a political campaign but also a moral campaign against white supremacy in South Africa, stating \\"It is an ideal which I hope to live for and achieve. But if needs be, it is an ideal for which I am prepared to die.\\" He rose above all challenges, risking his personal freedom, life and the safety of his family to unite blacks and whites together for his country.  This book is an inspiration to everyone who reads it, embodying the very spirit of hope and triumph.
B001TWT0AE|5.0|Maybe the reason this movie got poor reviews was that it was seen as just another John Wayne movie.  It is actually a great Jimmy Stewart movie with John Wayne as a co-star.  If one watches the movie closely, it shows how the John Wayne type hero was fading from the Western scene in the early 1900s and how law and order were taking the place of the tough guy with a gun.<br /><br />There are seven or eight actors in the movie who can be praised for their performances.  This is not a simple straightforward Western.  The character portrayals are especially good for John Wayne (Who said he couldn't act?), Jimmy Stewart, Vera Miles, Lee Marvin, and Edmond O'Brien.  The movie also provides a look at a young Lee Van Cleef and a younger Strother Martin.<br /><br />This was one of director Ford's last movies in black and white.  It is black and white by choice because color was available at the time it was filmed.  The black and white really heightens some of the night scenes.
B004P7CMDM|2.0|This is a good $5 deal for two mediocre movies!  The Crow: City Of Angels  What I liked about the movie:  1. The coloring of the movie made it very dark and brooding!  2. The criminals in this movie really deserved to be punished!  3. The basic plot was good!  4. The soundtrack was (for the most part) good but not great!  5. Most of the actors tried to do a good job with their parts!  6. The end of the movie had a nice twist to it!  7. The part after the crow kills the character Spider monkey (they play  White Zombie's I'm Your Boogieman) he walks out of the fire! That was my favorite  party of the entire movie!   What I didn't like:  1. The pace was too slow!  2. The plot didn't hold the movie up enough!  3. Vincent Perez was not the best choice for the crow!  4. Mia was not the best choice for a young adult Sarah!  5. They went a little over-board with the drugs!  6. Why is the cocaine black?  7. They were showing the same flashback sequences too many times!  8. There was too much whispering!   Bottom line: They pretty much too the first crow movie's basic ideas and ruined most of them!  My grade: C or two stars!  The Crow: Wicked Prayer  Bad, bad, bad movie!  What I liked:  1. The cast was great!  2. The lighting was good!  What I didn't like:  1. The dialog made no sence!  2. The plot made no sence!  Bottom line: I did not understand anything in this movie! It was bad! I know it was a B-movie, but still The Crow: Salvation was a B-movie but you could still understand what was going on in the movie! Even The Crow: City Of Angels had heart too it! So avoid this piece of crap, hopefully the next one will be better!  One can hope...!  Overall: The Crow: City Of Angels was weird but still watchable! But avoid The Crow: Wicked Prayer!  Overall grade for the package: C- or a-star-and-a-half!

B000059XUO|5.0|The Crow lives true too it's potential!  What I liked about this movie:  1. The soundtrack was excellent!  2. Brandon Lee was spectacular!  3. Micheal Wincott did his best performance ever!  4. Ernie Hudson was a great/goofy cop!  5. The scum-bag thugs that murdered Eric (Lee) and Shelly (his fiance') got what they deserved!  6. The movie had a great, dark tone to it!  7. The shoot out sequence in the club  was hardcore!  8. How Lee defeated Top Dollar (Wincott) had a nice twist too it!  9. The movie made me cry when I first sall it!  10. The giant flaming crow that Lee makes on the ground was awesome!  This is everything you could want from a comic book based movie! It was fun, exciting, spectacular,  and more...  My grade: A or five stars!
1400031354|4.0|I really enjoyed the first book in this series, and this second book doesn't disappoint. It goes into greater depth about the personal relationships in the book, though there are still of course mysteries.  So far I've found the books in this series to be pleasant but interesting reads when I'm not in the mood for something too dark or involved. That's not to say they're dumbed-down or overly simple, just that they're nice comforting reads.

B000NQRR1Q|5.0|I am not usually into movies that have anything to do with the occult, but this is one of my all-time favorite movies when I am in the mood for a curl-up-on-the-couch, eery mystery. Although it does ultimately have an occult theme, it is much more of a &#34;who-done-it&#34; and &#34;why&#34; kind of storyline. It's a little sci-fi and a lot believable.<br /><br />They couldn't have chosen a better actor than Johnny Depp to play the ruthless, money-hungry, rare book dealer Dean Corso. Hired by an extremely wealthy book collector, he travels to Europe to track down the only copies of a very rare and seemingly priceless book...at ANY cost. His motivation is his paycheck; the collector's motivation is where the mystery lies.<br /><br />The other book collectors are an unusual lot. Several murders take place. Little by little you start to realize that there may be more to these books than their collectable value, and Dean Corso realizes he has gotten himself involved in something much more sinister than he had anticipated, namely Satan worshipers who believe that the books were authored by Satan himself.<br /><br />Dean Corso is followed by a beautiful, elusive woman who seems to be helping and protecting him. Maybe she is an angel; maybe exactly the opposite.<br /><br />The settings for this movie are dark, dusty, and mysterious. The cast is excellent, so believable.<br /><br />In the end you are first left thinking that reality won out, but then maybe not. You will have to decide for yourself what really happens. And you will have to watch this intriguing movie for yourself to decide that.

The Kindle fits snugly into the case but can be removed easily also. My only issue is that the velvety flocked flap that folds over the screen picks up every piece of lint or hair within a mile!
B0032KNA4I|4.0|Though I don't believe this world as we know it will end in 2012, I do enjoy a good end-of-the-world disaster movie.  It isn't exactly reality TV, but then I don't watch movies for the realism; I watch them to be entertained...to be swept out of my living room and into a scene that makes a great Sci-Fi adventure.  This movie does that.<br /><br />The story revolves around your average divorced family where the father hasn't had enough time for the kids, and the mother and stepfather are perfect parents.  The tween-age son calls his father by his first name rather than Dad, an effort to show his disconnection and disappointment.  The disaster that ensues gives the real father (John Cusack) the opportunity to be the hero in the story.  So is it just me or is this the exact storyline for War of the Worlds with Tom Cruise?  Couldn't somebody have told the writer that that scenario had already been taken?  Enough said about that.<br /><br />There's a little bit of a science lesson in the movie, not unlike The Day After Tomorrow, and what scientists thought would someday destroy the earth many years from now suddenly fast forwards to a few hours away.  Volcanoes explode, the earth's faults crack wide open, and the oceans stir up tsunamis...you could say in Biblical proportions.  That said, think a Noah's Ark scenario.  I won't tell all and give it away.<br /><br />The thought-provoking part of this movie lies in the who-gets-to-be-saved question.  Have you ever wondered if the rich and important would have an edge up on the rest of us if something like this really did happen?  Is somebody out there preparing a way for a select few to survive?  This movie may stir up some thought on that.<br /><br />I don't think this is a GREAT movie, any more than I thought The Day After Tomorrow or Independence Day were GREAT.  But my husband and I have watched all of these many times because they are action-packed movies with terrific edge-of-your-seat special effects and entertaining actors.
B000QCSA54|5.0|Excellent little book. For me the main message is: aim to become the best in the world, focus on things in which you can achieve that, perseverate on it, and quit the other stuff.
B004SKHJF2|4.0|Would give 5 stars if it had support for Slacker and Google Music. Otherwise works great and as advertised. Rarely do I not get the correct song
B0063IH60K|4.0|Pretty good I like the fact that I can choose a winning deal or a random deal. Not bad at all
B00127RAJY|5.0|This workout does not fail! DO NOT feel rushed to do everything at once. Work you way up to one full session. I started out doing 1 circut a day then all 3 circuts until I felt confident enough to move on too the next level. It's what your willing to put in! I got confident of the results and stop! Gained weight back and rethinking my plan.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|I selected this cooler after reading countless reviews. I was concearned about it being hard to install. After watching several install videos on youtube, I decided to try it. Installation was a breeze, as this was a fresh build. This is cooling a Phenom II 955 3.2 Ghz Black Edition and seems to be working great. I did order a second fan to use in a push\pull configuration. (see my other reviews) This is a tall cooler, I think the specs said it was 6.2\\" tall. Plenty of room in my new Cooler Master Storm Enforcer case. Required a Y connector to run both fans from the CPU Fan Header. (again see other reviews) for the part number of the cable.I would definately buy this again!!
0439023521|5.0|The Hunger Games grips you right from the beginning. It's like your right there the undeveloped feelings that Katniss had for Gale. Katniss has feelings for Gale and thinks that Peeta is playing his feelings for Katniss in order to win and gain sponsers in the game. The tension and the action are throughout the story it is nonstop.   I recommend this book to all of my friends, and this is definatly a book for both boys and girls. The romance in here is not so overwhelming that it makes you gag it is present but it is just enough. And the action is unbelievable throughout the story it's like your right next to them fighting.  I can' wait to read the rest of the series and hope that everyone else reads it to!!!!
B004Z29X3E|3.0|*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />  Martha Marcy May Marlene is by newcomer director, Sean Durkin, who admitted during an interview that he has always been fascinated by Charles Manson and his followers, and that's why he decided to fashion his own story about a young woman who flees a fictional, upstate New York cult. Since I had a hard time believing in quite a bit of Durkin's tale, I found myself emotionally detached from his sketchy characters; ultimately, however, I found a good part of the film to be entertaining--'good, clean, creepy fun', if you will.<br /><br />  The protagonist is Martha, played with a nice intensity by the sister of the Olsen twins, Elizabeth Olsen. When we first meet Martha, she's on the phone with her older sister, Lucy, who she hasn't talked to in two years. It seems that Martha wants out of an abusive cult who she's been living with on a run-down farm. Lucy picks Martha up and brings her to a summer house in Connecticut where we're also introduced to Lucy's husband, Ted, a rather cold architect, who hails from Britain.<br /><br />  The film keeps flipping back and forth between the present time at the summer house and flashbacks to Martha's time as a member of the unnamed cult. In the present, Martha's behavior slowly becomes more and more weird. For example, she takes off her clothes to go swimming in full view of both her sister and brother-in-law and later crawls into their bed as the two are engaged in steamy lovemaking. Those red flags aren't enough for Lucy to get some professional help for her sister and we must wait until three quarters into the film when Martha has a complete meltdown during a party Lucy is throwing at the house, before her sister finally concludes that Martha needs to be in a psychiatric facility. It's also interesting that Lucy has no friends that she consults with about Martha and appears to rely completely on Ted, her wholly unsympathetic husband. I suppose there are some cold fish like Ted who believe in 'tough love' but at least wouldn't there have been speculation on both the sister and brother-in-law's part EARLIER in the film, that Martha may have been in a cult and needed some kind of professional help?<br /><br />  Until the unconvincing denouement, Durkin serves up a generic, cookie cutter cult, for our enjoyment. Like the Manson family, the majority of the participants are women who are mesmerized by a Svengali-like cult leader, Patrick (played by John Hawkes, who also had a similar role as the menacing, creepy uncle 'Teardrop' in 'Winter's Bone'). Everything you would expect to happen to the female followers in the cult, does. Initially, they're fed pills so they'll be half-asleep when they're led into Patrick's bedroom, where they're raped. Later, after being brainwashed, they appear to willingly engage in sex with the male 'leaders'. There's other creepy stuff including a scene where a cat is killed while the women are engaging in target practice with guns in the forest. It would have been more compelling if the cult members' personalities had been more fleshed out, but Durkin seems content to serve up the basics.<br /><br />  The story goes in the wrong direction when Durkin suddenly turns his rather docile cult into a bunch of Manson-like murderers. Initially, the cult is seen committing burglaries in expensive homes, presumably to keep the group financially afloat. But when the cult members are surprised by a homeowner they didn't anticipate being there during one of these burglaries, one of the female crazies, stabs him to death. The main thing about these cults is that they're quite secretive and don't like outsiders. Committing a murder is the last thing a cult leader would encourage, unless you're a borderline schizophrenic like Manson. Otherwise, the whole idea is to make sure your group doesn't call attention to itself. It's interesting that no police investigation is depicted following the stabbing in the home. Of course, in reality, there would have been one, and indubitably your dirty-looking cultists would probably have ended up as number one suspects.<br /><br />  Durkin was quoted as saying that he left the film's ending intentionally ambiguous. A friend of mine who saw the film with me, insisted that Martha, her sister and brother-in-law were dead meat: convinced that one of the cult members was following them in his car while Martha was being driven to the psychiatric facility, and just on the verge of doing them in. I prefer to believe in the more likely scenario, that what Martha saw were actually hallucinations, part of the paranoid frame of mind she was in (that includes the man she saw sitting on the rocks while she was swimming in the lake). One additional thought did come to mind: if the cult member actually succeeded in hunting down Martha and family, the police would have little trouble in drawing a connection between the two, since a cult member did return Martha's call to the summer house, which could have been easily traced.<br /><br />  Is Durkin morally repulsed by the machinations of these cultists or is he titillated by all the sexual hi-jinx? The fixation on Ms. Olsen's breasts, throughout the film, might suggest the latter. The more likely interpretation is Durkin has mixed feelings about his subject. After all, Lucy and Ted hardly come off as very sympathetic (in other words, Mother Theresas they are not!).<br /><br />  I hardly wish to rain on the parade of a first-time director, so let us acknowledge that Martha Marcy May Marlene does manage to entertain, despite a few unpleasant (and sometimes implausible) twists and turns. And what about the neat title? For those who missed it, 'Martha' is the protagonist's real name, 'Marcy May' is Svengali Patrick's pet name for her and 'Marlene' is the pseudonym, given by each female cult member, whenever they answer the phone. Cult members sure don't have it easy!your dirty-looking cultists would probably have ended up as number one suspects.

B000ZM1FXO|1.0|[[ASIN:B000ZM1FXO Caligula: R-Rated Edition]]I'm not in the habit of writing reviews but, THIS MOVIE WAS PISS.  It made some of the best actors/actresses out there look like crap.  It's as if this movie was thrown together like some last minute party from hell.  I've never in my life felt like I wasted money but the $2.99 I spent to rent this could've been better spent on an order of gummy bears from yummy.com.  I had heard so much about this film, how great it was and, I really wanted to like it.  A complete waste of time and money.
B004WR125O|1.0|Note: This was used with TX-NR509.  While the Onkyo is a great brand, supplemented with great sound, there is an issue when trying to access wi-fi. The wi-fi signal dropped randomly, and eventually lost the Access point completely. This is a known issue with Onkyo. Calling customer support, they ensured the firmware was up to date, and reset the receiver. Despite all this, the wi-fi dropped again. I consider myself a savvy tech user and know there are no router issues and there are also several wi-fi devices working just fine in the nearby proximity.   A 2nd wi-fi dongle was ordered in case there was an issue with the lan adapter. Same issue persisted. I ended up replacing the receiver with a new one. Same issue, again!   So, having received 2 receivers, with 2 wi-fi dongles, I was extremely disappointed. I would have the readers consider the TX-NR609 or another brand, as I have seen this in use at someone else's home theater system.   This review will also be copy+pasted for the Onkyo wi-fi lan adapter.
B004XDYJRU|4.0|After I originally downloaded and installed this application in May of 2011, I was impressed with the user interface.  Unfortunately that is about all about this application that impressed me.  From the beginning, this application would inexplicably stop playing after about 10 or 20 minutes and would refuse to re-start until I shut down and re-booted my Droid X phone.  The repeated shutdowns made this application useless.  Recently I was offered an update.<br /><br />Hoping that the update would resolve the shut-down problems, I authorized it.  Screen instructions said that the old app installation would need to be removed before the new version could be installed.  The update removed the old version, downloaded the new version, but then failed to install it on my phone.  Since I had paid for this application but could not install the new version on my phone, and my correspondence with the app's developer had gone unanswered, I contacted Amazon.<br /><br />With prompt phone help from a courteous Amazon representative, I finally got this application to install and work properly on my Droid X.  What a difference!  The helpful and easy-to-use interface was retained, but the shut-down problem appears to have been resolved, which was my main complaint.  As long as I have a decent Internet connection either via 3G or Wi-Fi I now have excellent audio performance and much more reliable performance.<br /><br />Whereas the previous version of this app frustrated me, this new version is a joy to use.  If you download this app, make sure that you install version 5.2 or higher, and I believe that you'll be pleased with it.
B002JVWQT6|5.0|Season 1 of Modern Family is outstanding.  The show is very funny and the cast works well together.  They play off each other's strengths.  The show is well written and well directed.  I think Phil is my favorite character.  One of the features I like about this show is the \\"audience laughter track\\" is not put into the show.  Instead it is left up to you to enjoy and laugh when appropriate and not be distracted by the audience laugh track.  I am looking forward to watching Season 2 soon on blu-ray as well.
B0052TDGQO|5.0|It is a great CD.  I love country music and this one is right up there headed to be a top 10 in my books.  I expect to see Scotty getting recognition on the Country Music Awards show next year.  Josh Turner move over you have some serious competition.
B0050SYS5A|5.0|You shouldn't always read what people are saying about the zoom. When I first bought it I was skeptical as well. It took a couple of tries but I got it figured out and since then have had no issues with it. It only takes a few minutes so those of you giving it a negative review might want to give it a better try because I live in a small apartment with barely anyspace to play with it at all and there have been no issues since I bought it. using at least 3 games and a demo .
1451648537|5.0|I am not a fast reader, but I read this one in a matter of days. Isaacson does a masterful job of telling the story of Mr. Jobs's life, as well as the obsessive traits that made his creations wonderful, and clearly made his personal relationships sometimes very difficult. Isaacon does not hold anything back: there are plenty of unflattering moments, but what emerges is a man determined to make the best products possible at virtually any cost, and clearly he did.   Next time you're on a train, or waiting at the airport, look around you and count how many people are listening to an IPod, making a call on their IPhone, or using an IPad. The obituaries that said he \\"Changed the world\\" were not exaggerating.
B003W5C0VW|5.0|I well remember the night in Philly when I stepped into the theater to see this for the 1st time; there was a life-size (plaster?) model of a cow in the lobby painted in wild day-glo, psychedelic colors. Can't recall if there was a sign next to it which read \\"sacred cow\\", or if that was simply my own conclusion...Anyway, I actually REELED when leaving the theater, the whole experience hit me that hard; over the years if you were lucky you could catch it @ a University showing or @ one of those great \\"alternative\\" second run movie houses. GREAT hard-hitting rock n'roll, mellow times: a communal joint would usually work its way down down the row of seats, total strangers united in their appreciation of the world's greatest rock n'roll band.    So catching it in a 1 night only showing last year was a blast...just wanna counter those nay-sayers who have reservations about \\"primitive recording quality\\" or think the DVD is somehow akin to a \\"poor quality bootleg\\". Not a bit of it, pay 'em no mind: this is hot, sweaty, PRIMAL R & R, you're right THERE w/ Mick & Keith when they share a mike & rip the Hell outta \\"Happy\\", & as others have said, \\"Love in Vain\\" is achingly beautiful, when it starts its \\"slow roll\\", the rhythms are not just sensual, but sexual, & \\"Midnite Rambler\\" is a workout, easily the finest version I've seen. And yes, Mick Taylor gives his all, & Charlie anchors the whole damn thing like he always does. As for any quibbles about \\"costume continuity\\", SAY WHAT ?? Can't BELIEVE that's even a minor issue for anyone, if so, yer hangin' w/ the wrong Band, dude. So buy it !! We shall not see their like again...

0140120416|5.0|This book is the one for beginners. Everything is explained well to the point. It covered a lot of material, but you can always adjust your leanning pace. To people like me that really need to understand/apprehend before being to remember things, this is definitely the book. The progress might be slow at the beginning, but I feel I can retain the knowledge better.  Of course you will need to have another audio product to help with pronunciation.   I just wish the book to be a litter bigger in size. I know a lot of people like its portable size, but the fonts can be a little difficult. And it does not stay in place if you want to put it on the table and write/copy stuff from it. and YES the cover already got worn out very quickly.
B004J1DBJI|5.0|It's the full thing, adapted from the web version, and no loss of features (that I've found yet). It's snappy and works great.  -LG G2X
B0043GAZYS|5.0|Okay, so the girl in the movie isn't really my girlfriend, but she is awesome.  The quality of the bluray is excellent.  The story is entertaining... and the 8 bit music is funny... oh wait, some are 16 bit music like zelda for snes.

0060873027|1.0|This novel does not do justice to the memory of Michael Crichton. It has  inept storyline, very predictable, and even dull. Whoever actually wrote the novel apparently thought it would help it would help to move the story along by giving us a lesson on the native and introduced fauna of Oahu (which I frankly found boring)and how said creatures are able to consume little people in increasingly grisly ways. By the end of the novel I was begging for the end, of the novel,  to be quick, like maybe be eaten by a Pheidole megacephala. But it was more like having wasp larvae crawl out of my arm-incredibly slow and painful. I really cannot recommend this novel. I was very disappointed.
B004VSTP4Y|5.0|Maggie deffinatly leaves you to make up your own mind on this one.. I love the entire series and Maggie made me fall in love with her writing the first chapter of the first book in this trilogy.
0321146530|4.0|A good starting point for TDD. Kent starts with a fairly simple example, that is useful to start learning the red/green/refactor paradigm. I would put more accuracy to the pattern chapter.
B005LJITS0|4.0|I loved this movie. I've read poor movie reviews before only to discover after viewing the movie myself that it was entertaining. I took that into consideration after seeing numerous mediocre reviews about Green Lantern. Wow, was I ever happily surprised. It was a fun movie. I hope there's a sequel.
B004I8WD6E|5.0|I bought this accessory set in July for my iPhone 4.  It is absolutely great for the price.  It is December and I'm not lying-I still have the same screen protector!!!!!  No bubbles.  Nada.  I can't believe how much money I blew on other protectors and this one was the cheapest and the best.  About the cover, it is durable.  Thanks to it, it has survived a few falls.  I dont like the amazon logo on the back but other than that, good buy.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|I started reading the Harry Potter books when I was just seven years old, and today I am still just as addicted to Harry as ever. I bought this the day it came out and I have watched it every single night since then. No words will ever be enough to express how incredible this movie is. If you are a true Potterhead, don't even hesitate just buy it!!  The words 'Thank You' would never be enough to express my gratitude towards this woman. She gave me a childhood, a home, a family, a place to go when I felt that the world didn't want me. She gave me a fandom to take part in, and one I will gladly serve in for the rest of my life. She gave me advice, and she gave me bravery and hope. She changed my life more than anyone else in the world, and if I ever have the honor of meeting her, I won't even know what to say because no words will ever amount to what I have to say. She changed my life in a way that no one else ever has.  BUY THIS MOVIE, YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT!! IT IS THE LAST MOVIE TO THE WORLDWIDE PHENOMENON!!!
B005HV6Y84|5.0|Since I love anything Twilight!  Of course I love this calendar,  It is done beautifully.  The pictures are so nice that you could  frame them if you wanted to.  I hope they have another one for Breaking Dawn Part II.
B005UT29Z0|1.0|What a boring movie! Impressive cast all gone to waste. Too much time spent belaboring how sorry the characters' situation was. And I couldn't bring myself to care even slightly, except for the Kevin Spacey character perhaps. The pace is so slow I fell asleep during the building steps scene toward the end (yes, I managed to stay awake up to that point), and woke up to the same scene. I dicovered the guy 1 row behind was doing the same so I felt vindicated. Why did this movie even get made?  Was this a lame attempt of some Wall St. producer to show they too are having a bad time? So sad I forgot to cry.
B00009YOQW|5.0|Finally- a noisy toy that sounds nice!<br /><br />This drum is well-made, beautiful, and sized perfectly for little hands. It is also designed with \\"cut outs\\" that allow for sound variation across the drum, which is a nice surprise for little ones.<br /><br />The only tip is to be sure you are buying this for the right age. Due to the size, it is ideal for the 12-18 month range. Plan Toys has a larger drum set that may be more appropriate for older toddlers.
B003VANOFY|3.0|As probably everyone has said these are great comfortable, headphones with awesome sound but they are not good for wireless. Once you disconnect from the USB cord you will get drop outs in the sound which is really annoying. Not just playing games but movies and music as well.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Very good app very useful. I travel a lot and this app allows me to always be prepared. I know how to pack, etc....<br /><br />My only issue is that it doesn't always update, it will lag by hours.
B004JRVQX0|3.0|ok, by now u already know all the complaints against an ilok.<br />personally, i didnt find it too difficult to register & use my software.<br />i know it hurts when u pay $1000 for a software & they make u pay additional<br />$50 just to use what u've legally purchased, but i understand the rampant<br />software piracy on torrents.<br />i was able to easily authorize my east west libraries with this ilok.<br />m running it on a usb hub without any problems. of course, a pen drive<br />is very easy to lose & i shudder when i hear stories of people losing<br />their iloks & going thru all kinds of s%&^ to get a replacement, but i hope<br />that never happens to me. apparently, thats when u run into the nasty side<br />of ilok support. i truly hate the fact u've to pay additional money even<br />for downtime protection. if i've paid for something, even if i lose it,<br />i should get a free replacement. apparently, the people at ilok dont understand<br />this at all. they charge u extra money for a replacement. clearly, an ilok<br />is nothing more than a cheap pen drive, $50 for this is ridiculous but i grumbled<br />& had no other way to use the east west library.

B005K2Z2O2|5.0|Love this! Must have. Feels safe from inside and outside. I bought this on Amazon and simply love this case!
B003Y5H5AG|4.0|Appropriate and interesting script, humor and skits for all ages. No adult allusions to concern a parent about. Animation detail and motion was good, but not great. Certainly not as varied or refined as what was found at, for example, the \\"Rango\\" level. A bit of unique personality came through for each Smurf character although some Disney dwarfs style stereotyping was present. Quite good acting from our human characters especially Azaria as Gargamel. Storyline was just unique enough to hold your attention although the idea of mythical creatures coming through some sort of space/time warp into our world, humorously trying to acclimate themselves and then trying to find their way back, has been done often enough.   Summary: Good entertainment value for this genre for all ages.
1451627289|5.0|I was 15 and living in the South when JFK ran for President, during the Civil Rights struggles (a participant, albeit Caucasian), during the Cold War.  This book has the writing, the scenes, the music and ambiance that had me reliving my early and mid-teens, hearing the music, riding in and driving the cars, eating the food.  Stephan King's Jake Ebbing felt my well remembered sense of bafflement over how nice people could have such evil beliefs and attitudes, and how evil people can be nice one-on-one.<br /><br />I would have never believed that a non-Southerner (King is a Mainer) would have so completely captured the existential bizarre-ness of that space-time; which I have often thought is the reason it continued.  Questioning it, or trying to connect dots that simply would not be connectable in a sane framework, was just either to hard or too frightening.  King had me again looking in the mirror, and being outside and inside at the same time<br /><br />I read the Kindle edition on my new Fire so I don't know how long it is in pages, but it isn't long enough.  Like Jake/George, I wanted to stay in that world before it turned upside down for me - before the assassinations of JFK, MLK, RFK aborted my coming to terms with it, forcing us all into what became embittered symbol clashes with human bodies paying the price.<br /><br />Thank-you, Mr. King, for a rare and delightful, and deliberately lingering read.

B002ZG9846|2.0|When I started watching this movie I expected a movie that's not trying to say anything about superheroes and how they relate to society. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the movie seemed to be smarter than it's promise at the beginning, but when you really read into the film you'll find just how shallow it really is.   As the movie starts out it seems to be a realistic commentary on what it would be like for a high-schooler to become a superhero, asking questions like \\"Why hasn't anybody tried it yet?\\" a statement which is flawed, considering that people HAVE tried it. The main character also states \\"X-Men, Fantastic Four, they got it all wrong, it's not the superpower that makes a superhero.\\" another flaw, considering that X-men and Fantastic Four have NEVER said that the hero is defined by his power. The movie gets REALLY lame when Big Daddy and Hit-girl come in, two very unrealistic superheroes who kill every drug dealer/thug they come into contact with. It's hard to answer why so few are willing to take the mantle of a superhero for the main character when a ten year old girl is stabbing bad guys left and right. As for the main character(kick-bum), he's a teenage boy who is a terrible superhero whose biggest contribution to crime-fighting is taking out a bunch of thugs with a gatling gun on a jetpack. At least the movie has a good musical score.   In summary, It's not the superpower that makes the superhero, it's the gatling gun jetpack.

B005C7MVC6|2.0|Let me preface this by saying I absolutely love Bon Iver's previous album and EP, For Emma Forever Ago and Blood Bank, respectively.  This, however, does not belong in the same group.  The frustrating thing is, this album would be great if it just didn't have all the horns and whatnot going on in most of the songs.  What made his previous work so good was the natural, haunting sound created by the fact that he made it by himself sitting in a cabin in the woods.  This, on the other hand, just sounds over-produced.  I wish he would do a re-release without the horns because I honestly think it would be excellent.  If you're interested in Bon Iver at all, I highly recommend you skip this one and pick up Blood Bank and For Emma Forever Ago instead.

B000TEPLFQ|4.0|Once upon a time, Blue Lines was praised for launching the \\"[[ASIN:B000003TSP trip-hop]]\\" style. I think it's more meaningful to think of it as a slightly modernized soul album. It has one straightforward, faithful cover of a [[ASIN:B0000008OF soul classic]] (\\"Be Thankful For What You've Got\\"). Other songs incorporate hip-hop and electronica, but retain the same basic tone: romantic, sensual, overtly emotional. Only \\"Five Man Army\\" exhibits the slow, dank clatter of \\"trip-hop\\" (see also \\"Inertia Creeps\\" on [[ASIN:B000T00PE2 Mezzanine]]), but it's really yet another classicist song, drawing heavily from dub reggae. If you're looking for startling, original musical ideas, they are not here -- you might try Tricky's [[ASIN:B000001E7V Maxinquaye]] instead.  Perhaps the one innovation that should be credited to this album is the concept of a band as a rotating, anonymized collective. That's much more common these days, thanks to [[ASIN:B005SMGRH0 Gorillaz]], which is why [[ASIN:B002ZPIC1M Heligoland]] made less of a splash than I think it should have. But the first side of Blue Lines still seems diverse and creative, with a new lead vocalist on each of the first five songs. \\"Safe From Harm\\" gains such epochal, menacing drive from its monstrous bassline (probably the best in all of electronica, and imitated for years afterward by such artists as [[ASIN:B000002NET Primal Scream]] and [[ASIN:B000002HH2 Bjork]]), and the histrionic dramatism of Shara Nelson's vocal, that it's somehow possible to ignore the very awkward lyrics (\\"you can free the world, you can free my mind\\" does not connote peril).  But then, Blue Lines has to be more than the sum of its parts, since none of the individual parts explains what makes the album special. The music sounds simple -- a few synth-chords here, an echo there, or a piano loop thrown in. The second side repeats the blueprint of the first, almost sounding like take two of the same thing, \\"Unfinished Sympathy\\" as a reprise/counterpart to \\"Safe From Harm,\\" \\"Daydreaming\\" repeating the rap dialogue of \\"Blue Lines.\\" This became a standard technique for Massive Attack: both [[ASIN:B000000W6X Protection]] and Mezzanine have the same structure, with all the surprise and stylistic novelty presented immediately in the first few songs. Lastly, among the vocalists, Robert Del Naja is a noticeably better rapper than the other two guys. Tricky's heavily accented delivery is a little sluggish, Del Naja runs circles around him. In Tricky's defense, though, his moody self-absorption is effective here as a dark contrast to the other vocalists.  The secret ingredient is the ethereal, gentle production: the soft synth background in \\"Safe From Harm\\" (a powerful contrast to the bassline) and the title track, the slight tonal shift around 1:45 of \\"Blue Lines,\\" right on Del Naja's cute \\"on my toes / comatose\\" rhyme, subtly lifting the song from the murk. The title track is a real gem, even more than \\"Safe From Harm.\\" The fast rap cadences and the gravelly voices of Tricky and Del Naja suggest some lingering darkness, but their voices are hushed low in the mix, and don't break the fragile mood set by the synths. It's the dreamiest rap song ever written. Elsewhere, Jamaican crooner [[ASIN:B000003MK5 Horace Andy]] gets a late-career revival by dressing up old standards (\\"One Love\\" and the quotes from his old songs on \\"Five Man Army\\") with newer, darker production. On \\"One Love,\\" he miraculously rescues another clunky lyric by delivering it with as much straightforward, unironic conviction as possible, so that it sounds like a proud declaration of principle.  All the success of Blue Lines comes from its direct emotional appeal combined with its humble tone. The title track would never have worked as a blustering rap battle with boasting and threats. \\"Safe From Harm\\" threatens retaliation, but in context, that sounds more like a desperate bluff. Del Naja asserts his street smarts, but that just involves being \\"on my toes\\" rather than expressing aggression. The characters depicted in the songs are very ordinary. This somehow makes all the sentimental, heart-on-sleeve appeals to love and devotion sound stronger. This is a very uplifting album. Without patronizing the listener, it makes being a good person seem desirable and natural.  From a musical standpoint, I prefer Protection, which takes the same basic ideas (multiple contrasting vocalists, romantic atmosphere) and develops them with much better and more modern production. Parts of Blue Lines do sound dated (or maybe they were just never that great to begin with), mostly in the second half. But the first half, up to at least \\"Five Man Army,\\" remains moving and engaging, like all the best soul albums.
B004LWZW9C|5.0|I Loved Valentine's Day and so when I heard about this one I was very excited to go see it and it has some of my favorite actresses and actors in it. Of course people will call this film predictable and cheesy just like all the romantic built movies, but honestly there is not one romantic type of movie that is not predictable. Of course you know what's going to happen at the end since it's called a romantic movie. I personally loved this movie, it had a lot of laughs and a couple parts where I got teary eyed. The movie has well put together characters and a very good plot. The ending just like Valentine's Day where it brought characters throughout the movie together some predictable and some were the complete opposite of predictable. I Love this movie and recommend it to anyone who likes romantic comedies or likes Valentine's Day. Who cares what the critics say they are wrong most of the time. Go to enjoy the movie, not to critique it.
B000062XGG|5.0|However you look at it, this is filled with the usual accouterments of films about Alien attacks. Nevertheless, the film is much more than the sum of its parts. It does give you two hours of entertainment and something of the same kind of feeling that watching and  hearing the spectacular 3000 person band play at University of Michigan's stadium  in football Season (as it did, at least once, some sixty odd years ago). Clearly Judd Hirsch, Jeff Goldblum and Will Smith carry away acting honors, presumably because their hallmarked styles could not be repressed entirely by their stereotyped roles. The stunts, impressive on normal TV must be  pretty spectacular on updated equipment. The score does an excellent job of reinforcing and enhancing the plot, and the supporting actors do a good job in roles that were well delineated from early in the life of films. As for depth of thought, enlightenment on the problems of mankind, the dilemmas inherent in weapons of mass destruction already available to us, forget it, this was not a vehicle for initiating thoughtful deliberation about them. To get relief from such speculations during the Presidential election year (or two), to escape all the dreary political news, this movie is recommended.

B001UV4XI8|5.0|The movie for the first half of the last Harry Potter book was excellent and I felt it ended at the appropriate place.  It made me look forward to the next movie.  The blu-ray was awesome as usual, the best format to see these movies in, imo.
1609611543|4.0|A much better introduction to the subject would be Gary Taubes' \\"Why We Get Fat.\\"  This book makes a valuable contribution to the field by helping people understand the dangers of refined grain. Its weakness is implying that wheat is the bogeyman when there's an army of bogeymen.  For people who are prone to overweight and blood sugar problems (i.e. most middle aged Americans), the only way out is to focus on foods that do not raise blood sugar and produce an insulin reaction.  That means avoiding wheat, yes, but it also means avoiding corn and rice, potatoes and other starches, and sugar in all forms. It means understanding that sugar-bomb fruit like bananas, grapes and oranges is quite bad for you.  This is why escaping obesity is so difficult in our society. You basically have to live on protein, fat, oils nuts and seeds, leafy greens and low-carbohydrate vegetables. It can be done (I and my wife eat this way every day) but it is an adjustment. Avoiding wheat is probably a good start, but it is just the start.

B001ECDVKE|4.0|Released in Christmas 1996, Tim Burton directed this just after doing the successful biop with Johnny Depp, \\"Ed Wood.\\"  Another film based on the nostalgia Burton had for the old 1950s film and the short-lived gum card set by Topps, \\"Mars Attacks,\\" the film is overblown, corny and an all-star cast!  Loved it.<br /><br />Burton has often been a hit or miss director for me - from the great Ed Wood and the awful remake Planet of the Apes, and so I was happy to review this one.<br /><br />Storyline and plots:  The film has lots of subplots with different people dealing with their own worlds as the planet is invaded by saucers from Mars - ships that look just like the 50s invasion film \\"Earth versus The Flying Saucers.\\"<br /><br />Jack Nicholson plays a dual role - the President of the USA who wants to put a positive spin on everything, and a wild Vegas investor who is a sketchy guy running The Galaxy Hotel.  Jack is funny as he overacts and really has fun with the script.  Fun to see Pierce \\"Bond\\" Brosnan and Sarah Jessica Parker as they lose their heads over the Martians.<br /><br />What can stop the impossible, invincible Martians?  How about a country-western record?  Ha!<br /><br />Bottom Line:  As a lover of the old classic science fiction films, it was great seeing a well-made parody of those old films, with some digs regarding the military (kill! kill!) the government (\\"We still have two out of three branches of government operating and that's not bad!\\") and the Kennedy room!  Great to see early appearances of Natalie Portman, Jack Black and of course the Twin Towers.
B005SJIP2S|1.0|I'll agree with the other one-star reviewers, not from hearing the album, but from seeing Yes live in 2011. The band were inexplicably sluggish. The songs had no fire, no spark. Yes are normally so tight and energetic. It seemed like a lot of the time, the other band members were watching Alan White out of the corner of their eyes to make sure they all stayed together. The playing was very measured and tentative. I was disappointed.

B005ELQVGW|1.0|As with every musical genre, there are good and bad aspects of it. To do something experimentally musically \\"proper\\" does not always mean to make it more diffictult and more abstract. Unfortunately, Bjorks' Biophilia fails on both ends and ceases to impress while also leaving the listener in an empty void. The people and hardcore fans that gave this album a 5-star rating are only tricking themselves in buying into this album. But let's face it, it is not that good - at most it's a 2-star for it's effort, I gave it a 1-star because simply it does not meet my expectations and I will not waste my time wrapping my mind around these meaningless works. To me, Bjorks albums have been gradually getting worse and worse over time, with the exeception of Vespertine, but this just hits rock bottom. By the looks of it, her next album will probably just feature her vocals alone, which gets old very quick. Furthermore, there is no art here, its just mindless babble, hitting around the notes and calling it good and slapping it done with some string attatchments in the background. There is no value here or anything to hold onto. Maybe I'm just not seeing it, but as a music connoisseur I like a lot of weird and abstract stuff out there thats done properly amd frankly this just doesn't cut it for me.   In the end, save your hard earned dollars and if you truly want something artistically and abstract thats done \\"properly\\" get Portishead - Third.   Treat it don't beat it.
044024238X|4.0|I've never written a review and I thought I would write one for \\"the Undomestic Goddess\\" by Sophie Kinsella.  I just finished reading Can You Keep a Secret? and I decided to find another one of Kinsella's novels to read and this one sounded really interesting. And it was. I fell in love with the characters and the story. I love Sophie Kinsella's writing. It is just a fun chick-lit read.  The ONLY problem I had with this book was that fact that it should have ended sooner than it did. It seemed to drag on at the end and I just felt like the character was struggling TOO much. I found myself just wanting to be able to put the book away and have it be done, when at the beginning I did not want to put it down because I loved it so much.  In the end, it was still a really good read and I'm glad I purchased it.

1553655427|4.0|Former consultant to the World Bank, Dambisa Moyo, releases her first book about how foreign aid has not been successful for African development and how foreign direct investment is a better way forward. This relatively short book contains two parts. The first part examines the history of foreign aid and the myth of its effectiveness in economic and political development. The second part is her explanation of possible solutions to African underdevelopment. Four chapters break up part one of the book. Chapter one introduces two concepts, first is the lack of development in Africa and the second concept is a description of what is foreign aid. Chapter two gives a relatively brief examination of the history of institutions such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, that are the main institutions who distribute foreign aid and to Africa. This flows into the next chapter, which deals with the overall ineffectiveness of foreign aid and comparing it to the effectiveness it is considered to have in post-World War Two Europe. This ultimately leads to chapter four, which describes the economic destruction and corruption nature of foreign aid. Vast majority of the chapter involves the examinations of the different ways foreign aid corrupts the economy, government, growth, and social welfare of the receiving state. It also introduces the dependency of foreign aid by African Governments. Moyo then presents the readers a possible option for Africa's future, a world without foreign aid.   In part two of her book, she presents the hypothetical African state of Dongo and presents how Western assistance in the form of foreign direct investment could replace the model of ineffective foreign aid. Chapter five introduces a new approach to foreign assistance in the form of weaning off dependency of developing countries from western foreign aid. In replace of foreign aid would be in the form of foreign direct investment and capital movements. She writes about how government bonds, similar to the Global Emerging Markets Local Currency Bond Program, which would bring in the necessary capital for developing countries, but it forces the country to eventually pay back the money it accepts with interest. She then tests this concept on her fictional Dongo state. The following chapter, Moyo introduces the Chinese structure of foreign aid to Africa and states how much more effective it is compared to the traditional style of foreign aid. In particular, she stresses how China distributes foreign loans and how it is Chinese labor that constructs the infrastructure projects in Africa. This prevents African Governments wasting World Bank grants and loans in the construction of infrastructure projection. Once again, Moyo changes directions in chapter eight from that of Chinese foreign aid towards how free trade can bring economic growth. She does write about how Chinese need for natural resources will increase the opportunities of free trade even though it has its negative effects. By the end of the chapter, she once again examines how her fictional states can benefit from trade through its comparative advantage. Chapter nine returns to the need for developing states to attract capital through international banking, domestic savings, and remittances. Before the next chapter, Moyo depicts how her fictional state would look like to the political economist if all her policy prescriptions were followed. Thus, she concludes at chapter ten of how her policy prescriptions would benefit African development.  Overall, the short book, only 154 pages of text, Moyo does articulate very well her understanding of the structure and effectiveness of foreign aid and a possible new approach to aid developing countries. However, the book is often too simple for academics, by her lack of empirical evidence as well as how she describes current African development. Throughout the book, she presents one-sided quantitative figures without properly explain their overallinterpretation. She limits it to her interpretation and does not present all the data for the reader to decide. Also, many negative aspects of foreign aid seem to have been exaggerated such as the correlation she attempts to make between foreign aid and increases of civil conflict on page fifty-nine to sixty. There are also problems of the ethical foreign aid policies of China, which she exits from in a one-paragraph description. Economic questions arise when making assumptions that state's economies can be so cut and dry when comparative advantage in the global economy. Even with the flaws and lack of empirical evidence, the book provides another option for African development than the traditional foreign aid by the Western powers.

B005DF2QMC|4.0|This device does a fairly good job. However, this device needs improvement, such as having an automatic shutoff after rewinding the tape, otherwise the reel continues to tighten the tape. Afterwards, on playback, the sound from the tape is distorted. It is recommended to shutoff the device immediately after the rewind reel stops, that way the sound from the tape on playback is better.

030788743X|5.0|Wade - known in the OASIS as Parzival - like many of the people in his future society, spends most of his time immersed in the virtual-reality, on-line world known as the OASIS.  Created by a brilliant but eccentric man, who was obsessed with the culture of the 1980s (as well as the 1970s and 1990s) named James Halliday, OASIS helps modern people forget the misery of their poverty-stricken lives in a world where energy sources are so rare and expensive that many people can't even afford to go to a job if they are lucky enough to have one.  When Halliday dies and wills his entire fortune, and the control of the OASIS, to whomever manages to find a hidden Easter Egg inside OASIS, a fierce competition arises, leading to dangers that Wade couldn't possibly have imagined.  Will he be able to solve the puzzles to find the clues to reach the end?  Will he even manage to survive that long?<br /><br />I was about half afraid that this book would be so full of obscure, 1980s pop culture references that the average person wouldn't have a clue - being a child of the 80s myself, I wasn't too worried about it, personally, but I could see where it could be a problem.  While it is true that there are some rather obscure references, for the most part they are explained enough so that pretty much anyone can enjoy and understand them.  The evolution of Wade and his budding friendships with Art3mis and Aech made for fascinating reading, as did the intricate puzzles that were created to stump the players.  I can definitely recommend this book for almost anyone.
B005VR9328|5.0|The Roots do it again ladies and gentlemen !! Their 13th album Undun is a creative musical masterpiece. I can't stop listening to it. Black Thought is on point with the lyrics as usual. Dice Raw and the guest appearances are also off the chain. On the music side, ?uestlove and crew outdid themselves once again. I bob continuously when this album is playing. My two favorite tracks on the album are 'One Time' and 'The Other Side'. The last four tracks (which are orchestral) are smooth too especially while kicking back after a hard day's work sipping some wine with dinner while listening to them along with the rest of the album. Another thing about this album and one reason why I love The Roots in the first place (like I mentioned in a review for How I Got Over last year), The Roots still didn't lose their originality like 95% of Hip Hop has over decades. With only one sample on the whole album (Kool) which is still a great, great track, The Roots are still creative by making their own beats and they pull it off well once again on this album. I'm okay with samples, remakes, and cover songs I just like to see how much people can create music on their own. The only bone I have to pick with The Roots in general (now don't get me wrong but I love Owen Biddle and Mark Kelley) but it seems like since Hub retired, the band haven't really been comimg with any tracks with the smooth, groovy, riffy, eighth-noted basslines such as 'Dynamite' and 'Ain't Saying Nothing New' and they haven't been performing those songs in concert since Hub retired. True Hip Hop heads should definitely go buy Undun because it's an indication that The Roots are far from finished !!

(And that was reinforced after watching That Metal Show tonight in which Biff was a guest and said as such). The first two tracks rock, and I really love the track Chasing the Bullit. Sounds like AC/DC could have done it. Title track really good too. All in all, a very solid Saxon album.

1451648537|5.0|I finished the last few pages of this biography in the following environment: My Apple TV played Cars streamed from my Mac that I controlled with my iPhone. All that was missing was an afternoon trip to an Apple Store somewhere. This illustrates not my dependence on technology (a topic that was addressed several other times in my reviews), but on the influence Steve Jobs has in my life. In many ways, Apple's history is my history. Since I'm only a little older than Apple, I can connect aspects of my life with its.<br /><br />I bought my first Mac in 1998 and lived in an Apple-exclusive home every since. The history of Apple and the computer industry has been a favorite topic of study over the years, and I've read and watched many books and movies. I have been an Apple enthusiast/evangelist for over a decade. I, like many, fell into Steve's charismatic spell. Because of this, reading the new biography about Steve Jobs was not an option; it was an edict from within. The author, Walter Isaacson, chronicled the lives of Benjamin Franklin, Albert Einstein, and now, Steve Jobs.<br /><br />Steve Jobs was a many of contradictions.<br /><br />He was a billionaire, and he was a Zen Buddhist.<br />He created beautiful products, but he lived as a minimalist.<br />He was a charismatic man, but he was a complete jerk everyone around him.<br />He talked about passion in life, but he largely ignored his family.<br />He believed in design and beauty, but he ignored a Creator or Architect.<br />He believed in eschewing the trappings of the world, but he created the prettiest ones.<br /><br />Isaacson gives a multi-faceted picture of the man who popularized geek, both the good and the ugly. And there is lots of ugly. The book is fast-paced and thoroughly enjoyable, even if you were not interested in computer history. Steve Jobs is as tormented of a man as any character is a Dostoevsky novel. He wants to build great things, but he gets in his own way. He died with few close friends, but changed the technology world for the good. On one side he inspired engineers and designers under his leadership to create products that couldn't be done, but he did this with berating, insulting, and, at times, crying. Most leaders use encouraging phrases like \\"Good job!\\" and \\"Impressive!\\" to help build up employees. Steve Jobs's favorite line when he is shown a new design or feature is, \\"This is s&*@!\\" To Steve, this isn't an insult; rather, it is a motivational tool.<br /><br />What makes this book rich and deep is not just the computer history narrative, but it is also the subplots that run through the story: adoption, Steve's estranged daughter that he denied for years, his romantic life, Bob Dylan, and Steve's cancer. These secondary stories make Jobs more human and relatable to use non-billionaire geniuses.<br /><br />While I learned much more about Apple, the one aspect that I was more surprised to discover is how much Steve Jobs really did at Apple, even in the final days. He micromanaged design, usability, packaging, commercials, color of walls, construction of new buildings and campuses, tile in Apple stores, the \\"floating\\" staircase in the stores, and even the dinner menu at events. Before I read the book, I thought that Apple would continue just fine without him. Now, after reading how he made all the decisions, I'm not so sure.<br /><br />There's so much more I want to say in praise of this book and for Steve Jobs and Apple, but I'll save those for conversations with my geeky friends. I wish I could have it with Steve himself. Steve Jobs was one man I wanted to have dinner with someday. (Sidenote: I did have coffee with Apple's other co-founder, Steve Wozniak. It was a great conversation with a slightly odd fellow. Read about it here). I'd love to talk about how his quest for design, order, and beauty springs from something within us, something built by an ultimate Designer. There was an interesting spiritual comment from Jobs as Yo-Yo Ma was playinghis cello for an event. \\"You playing is the best argument I've ever heard for the existence of God, because I don't really believe a human alone can do this.\\" After this, Jobs made Yo-Yo Ma commit to playing the cello at his funeral. Fittingly, I am listening to Ma's Bach Cello Suites as I type this.tence of God, because I don't really believe a human alone can do this.\\" After this, Jobs made Yo-Yo Ma commit to playing the cello at his funeral.

B000056TKC|5.0|This 1958 recording is the first version of a stereo recording of the Beethoven's 9th. This reading by Fricsay has spatial separation between the instruments and precision in keeping the notes different - no acoustic smudging. This is a cool and objective reading of the music which leads to dramatic moments without over-dramatization. The recording quality is decent enough for a 1958 recording - that too being the first stereo recording of this work. There is delicateness where we hear individual instruments or groups of instruments.  There is orchestral oneness when the orchestra and chorus play in unison in the last movement. In both cases, there is a briskness, and non-vulgar excitement. There is no over-excitement for the sake of instant gratification of the listener - no erratic    temperamental dramatization. All the dramatization is happening from the score on the page with a metronomic precision that I have not heard in any other recording. Fricsay evokes rigorous muscular playing in the strings in the passages that need it; he employs delicate distinctness in tone across woodwinds and strings wherever needed; the timpani beats with atomic precision; the pizzicato is spot on. The energy and heat of the first two movements is inspirational. I can hear the lyrical beauty of the 3rd movement like I've never heard in other recordings. The dramatic impetus, rhythmic drive and orgasmic intensity of the chorus and orchestra in the last movement is breathtaking.   Over the past few weeks I had been doing a Beethoven symphony referesher - listening to all the 9 Beethoven cycles and assorted individual Beethoven symphony CD recordings I own and I have to say that at the end of my refresher, I found a number of Beethoven 9ths that I treasure in my collection as being superlative (George Szell, Karl Bohm, Haitink, Giuilini, Zinman) - each bringing their own flair and vision to the work; but this one by Eric Fricsay has got to be the best 9th ever put to disc hands down.
B001NFTZPM|5.0|Comes with the movie and the \\"Psychology of the Bat\\" documentary about the psychological aspects of Batman and various villains. The documentary is wonderful and is the highlight of the product. It is very interesting and provides an in-depth look at the characters of Gotham City. The movie is also an incredible work of cinematic art and both of them combined make for an outstanding experience.

And then I read the next two books in the trilogy.  All in one weekend.  I loved these books. Really, really loved them.  I am not sure if it's the characters, especially Katniss, or the way it made me think about violence, goodness, evil, children and war, or if it was just the great storytelling.  But who cares.  These are immensely readable and thoughtful books for kids and for adults.

B004A8ZWVK|5.0|I just received the movie on Friday and watched it immediately.  I read the book last year so I usually don't like to see the movie afterwards.  I have to say, the movie was so perfect that I felt like I was reading the book all over again.  Of course, you will never get as much information into a movie but it was real close.  Love it.
0439023513|1.0|I really enjoyed the first book.  I was afraid the second book couldn't compare to the first and it didn't, but it was still pretty good.  The third book was just awful - hollow and depressing.  I forced myself to get through it in hopes that it would get better, but it just got worse.  Unfortunately this book ruined the entire story for me.
B004DI7HZ6|2.0|To be fair, I didn't finish the book. Shoot, I didn't even finish the first 1/4 of it. But be fair to me, Deborah Harkness! You've gotta give me something.

B005HSG3TC|3.0|The Kindle needs a cover, and this one is okay, but the fold up \\"stand\\" feature doesn't really work.  Its a bit expensive for what you get, and glad they brought it down in price as a result.   I'd say its just okay, but so far I  haven't seen anything better.
B005QUQP76|5.0|For the little time I've used it, I Love it, I didn't install any software, just installed and it works, the 2 side buttons fit my hand just right, they are default to forward and back buttons, the scroll wheel is excellent, I like the way it has a detent (I think thats the word I want) for scrolling that you feel. the 2 buttons below the scroll wheel are for increasing or decreasing DPI, the default has three different settings (for me the middle setting is fine) the Sniper button is the slowest DPI setting from what I can tell, push it and hold it and your cursor barely moves, let go of the Sniper button then your back to what ever DPI you had set. The cable is at least 7 ft with a nice covering, not very stiff and looks good. I'm using a piece of black plastic which is the same material has a Rats Pad, I got it at Tap Plastic and it covers my whole desk where my keyboard and mouse is, the feet are very good and tracking on this surface is Great. The Corsair software seems a little buggy from what I read over at there forums. Great price right now at Amazon $59 for this mouse is a steal!

B005FLX2WC|5.0|To first display my ignorance, I'd never heard of Beth Hart and have obviously been missing something - an incredible force of nature who can sing a wide variety of music; she just might have displaced Etta James in my pantheon of greats for blues & R&B. I think this is the best guitar playing by Joe B. available. Whilst I've alway been in awe of his technical ability, can't say I've cottoned much to his songs that I've found to be a bit too heavy and turgid - so shoot me! Here he plays a wide variety of styles with great imagination and dead-perfect precision, and we even have something that sounds like a tip of the hat to Jeff Beck in the last track. The sign of a great guitarist isn't just tearing off mind boggling riffs but making other people sound good, and Joe really carries it off here. A great combinaton of artists, and the album very well produced with excellent sound.

B003LZ5B7S|5.0|My son is 16.  All of his high school friends were always talking about \\"the doctor\\" and quoting obscure lines from this show.  He asked if we could watch this british series together.  I must admit that I was not really looking forward to it, as it seemed so campy and silly.  Okay - it is.  But, boy was I wrong about not wanting to watch.  We are now finishing season 3 (we have one episode left) and he asks me every night if we will have time to watch \\"a Doctor Who.\\"  Who would expect a teenage boy to want to watch a show with his parent?  They are great fun, family friendly, no nudity and very creative (and yes, silly, funny, campy and entertaining).  Now he can join in with the other juniors in high school and talk about their favorite \\"doctor.\\"  Especially if you have PRIME (like we do) and it's free.  What's to lose?  Give it a try!

B0034G4OVS|5.0|The setup for \\"Frozen\\" was fairly straight forward.  Three friends were winding down from a day of skiing on the slopes.  They decided to make one last run.  Through a series of miscommunications, the chairlift they were riding was shut down while they were still in the air.  The resort went dark, everyone went home, and the three skiers were forgotten.  To make matters worse, it was Sunday night and the ski resort wasn't scheduled to open again for five days.  As this story unfolded, I found myself imagining how I would respond if it happened to me.  What would I do?  Would I remain calm and try to wait for help to arrive, or would I panic and try something desperate like jumping?  My reaction surprised me, as I imagined myself jumping even though this went against my sense of reason!  Perhaps this was the main reason I liked \\"Frozen.\\"  It tapped into two of my biggest phobias (the fear of heights and the fear of being trapped) and it forced me to think about how I would respond.  I almost quit watching it after the first half hour because it was too intense!  Some people have challenged the believability of \\"Frozen.\\"  Could this story really happen?  I'll leave that question for others to debate.  I, however, enjoyed \\"Frozen\\" because it showed how easy it could be to throw reason to the wind when you are in a desperate circumstance.

0307959856|4.0|This merging of two of fiction's most beloved genres by the great British detective novelist P. D. James  promises to be a treat for readers who are addicted to both the novels of  Jane Austen and British mysteries. As a huge fan of both, I had a marvelous time and would love to see both a movie version and a sequel.<br /><br />But what if you're only addicted to one of those genres?  Here's what to expect:<br /><br />AUSTEN FANS  should know up front that Lady Catherine, Mr. Collins and Mrs. Bennet do not make personal appearances in this book, although we're briefed a bit on their their views on the subject at hand.  I think the author was wise to do this for a couple of reasons (1) there isn't anything silly about murder, so comic relief appearances from  Austen's most deliciously ridiculous characters wouldn't have easily fit  in such a  setting and (2) While James is a very good writer, she probably couldn't have equaled Austen's gifts for creating (or re-creating, as she'd have had to do here) those three famous fools. The main characters here are the Darcys, the Bingleys, the Wickhams, Georgiana,  Colonel Fitzwilliam and, of course, Pemberley itself. There are guest appearances by Mr. Bennet, Mrs. Reynolds and Mrs. Younge, along with the corpse in question, who was one of P&P's minor characters.  All of these updated characterizations rang true to me.  Austen fans will  also be treated  to some gossipy whatever-happened-to updates about  Mary and Kitty Bennet,  Anne de Bourgh and the key characters in  Austen's  \\"Persuasion.\\"<br /><br />WHODUNIT FANS will get a pretty good backgrounder on the leading characters and  their history and will likely find fascinating James's looks into the workings of 19th Century British jurisprudence. But will that be enough for most non-Austenites to get involved in this story? I kind of doubt it, but I hope I'm wrong.  The world of books could certainly use a few more double-genre readers.

I love Merry Christmas Baby with I think Doctor John joining Xtina, my favorite version is by Charles Brown and Bonnie Raitt, but this rendition is on par.  This CD is pop so if you are looking for a classic Christmas CD pass this one by, but if you want some fun, slinky as well as touching Christmas music then I think you would enjoy this - give it a try.

B0000C8AW7|5.0|-Written as Newspaper review in 2001 while the album was brand new (released on Amazon.co.uk in 2007).  For whatever reason I never released this on the main Amazon site.  Bob Dylan, one of rock's most revered and legendary songwriters, proves himself one more time with his 43rd album, Love and Theft.  This album, released when manufactured teeny bop music and heavy metal are the dominant forces in music, proves one thing: never count Dylan out.  Dylan not only releases the best album of the year, but accomplishes bringing us back to rock's roots with gusto, humanity, humour, and just pure fun. Dylan gives us a journey into American's long, rich, musical history.    The fact is, our musical culture has been wasting away, which is the main reasons for people suddenly becoming interested in rock's roots.  These roots are more interesting than rock itself these days.  Anymore everything's so commercial and has such a manufactured feel, people are looking for quality music and there's just not a lot out there being recorded.    The genius of Love and Theft is it forces us to examine what rock used to be about.  The rock machine in general has lost its impetus and now is a manufactured, image-driven parody of what it once was. Love and Theft illustrates the power of older musical traditions and what rock can return too.  The songs range from blues to 1950s rock to crooning to Depression era music to lounge music while retaining that distinctly Dylanesque style.  Anyone familiar with Dylan knows he has a whole ensemble of characters in his music, and they're back and bigger than ever.  The world of Love and Theft is where gamblers, con men, town sheriffs, and old, gnarled blues men carry out their lifestyles, floating in and out of our mind's eye as Dylan effortlessly recounts their lives.  Let's hope we'll listen to Dylan and rock will redeem its tarnished and shaky credibility.  Then rock will transform into a potent, cultural and artistic force.   Not enough good things can be said about Dylan's backup band.  His touring band for four years, these guys are his best band since, well, The Band.  Including Augie Myers, legendary Texas organist who has known Dylan since the 1960s, they sound like they're having just as much fun as Dylan with the music and I don't think Dylan could have found a better backup band.  His previous release, 1997's Time Out of Mind, Dylan put his depressed, broken heart on display for the whole world to see.  Time's mood was dark, pessimesitic, and convinced the world had gone to hell in a handbasket.  Love and Theft, however, not only approaches life with dignity but also   Love and Theft walks all over Time's depression.  In \\"Cry a While,\\" he says \\"I feel light a fighting rooster, feel better than I ever felt,\\" and later in that same song \\"I'll buy me a barrel of whiskey, I'll die before I go senile.\\"  While Time seems like Dylan was searching for a place to display his misery, Love and Theft has Dylan cracking jokes, singing music he loves, and obviously having a grand time.

B002NPY7FE|5.0|Wow! I haven't seen this in a long time... It was fun! But I'm not a critic so whatever. The Blu Ray quality was pretty awesome for a $5 bin movie at Target! Watched on a 160 inch projector screen.... The special effects on the dog are awesome. Snot, gross green slime, blood, everything really shined through in the transfer. If you are a fan of this movie and you find it for $5 it's definitely worth it!
B00003CX9Q|4.0|In 1982 the original version of Spielberg's E. T., The Extra Terrestrial to hit the theatres and became one of the biggest hits in movie history.  Spielberg and his crew had created an international phenomena which has gone into cinema history as one of the top twenty highest grossing films this century.  The scene where Eliot and E.T. fly across the moon, now the official logo of Spielberg's Amblin studios, is one of the most recognizable moments in cinema.  To those select few unfamiliar with E.T., the story is both very solid and well-crafted.  An anthropologist race of extraterrestrials are investigating the vegetation on earth, and due to people chasing them, the ship has to go, leaving a lone alien, who promptly has to run for his life.  After a memorable sequence in Eliot's family shed, where E.T. throws a baseball back after Eliot hears a noise and he throws it in, Eliot gets scared.  None of his family believes them, but in the end Eliot finally meets E.T.  From there, E.T. learns to talk, teaches Eliot a thing or two about drinking, and takes him on the most memorable bike-ride in movie history.  Through the course of the movie, the government, whose never fully explained in the film, discover just where E.T. is at, and they try to take him away.  The climax of the film is both harrowing and very emotional.  There are two things to be noted about the film's ending.  One, E.T. was filmed chronologically, a very rare thing in Hollywood.  The emotional response of each of the principals to E.T.'s departure is real.  Another is that E.T. is the only film that Spielberg has reedited to fit the film's score.  The original ending was too short for John Williams' score, and Williams told Spielberg about the problem he had, and Spielberg changed the film's ending to fit his score.     That's the film in all its glory.  The original deserves all the acclaim it got.  So what have they added in the Twentieth Anniversary re-release?  Well, some very interesting changes.  The most noticeable is the opening scenes where E.T. runs away from the humans.  In the original, as Spielberg said in the documentary recently aired on ABC, E.T. looked as if he was on a track, and in the rerelease you can see E.T. actually running.  They added two deleted scenes, one from the Halloween sequence and a bathroom scene with Elliot and E.T.  Why the Halloween scene didn't make it to the original I'm not sure.  The bathroom scene was cut because Spielberg felt the animatronics were too lacking.  They have digitally reanimated many of E.T.'s facial shots, the most noticeable being Elliot's first encounter with E.T. and when Gerty (Barrymore) meets E.T. for the first time.  To the original film's credit, most of E.T. himself goes untouched, and what they do change never feels gratuitous or out of place.  While over 100 shots were redone, they are so seamlessly incorporated into the original that it never occurs to you that this has been redone.  The only time you can really tell it's CGI is the bathroom scene.  George Lucas could learn a few things from Spielberg in this regard.    The most interesting changes occur near the end of the film.  In the original, Elliot's mother tells his brother that he cannot go to Halloween as a terrorist.  In the ending sequence, the agent's guns are changed to walkie-talkies, which Spielberg said he always regretted having in the original film and would be the one guaranteed change if he ever re-released E.T.  One of the rumored changes that did not make the film is Harrison Ford's only scene as Elliot's principal which was cut from the film because Spielberg thought it was to distracting.  (Ford's wife wrote E.T.'s screenplay).  Hopefully, we will see this footage on the DVD.  For those of you who have not seen it, this is a great opportunity to see this remarkable film.  For those of you who know the film, discover E.T.'s magic one more time.  -Written as Newspaper review in 2002 while the movie was in theatres (released on Amazon.co.uk in 2007).  For whatever reason I never released this on the main Amazon site.

B000K7UG34|2.0|We Were Soldiers, a true story, deals with the first contact between the North Vietnamese Army and U. S. soldiers.  The U. S. quickly discover they have underestimated the Vietnamese forces and find themselves vastly outnumbered.  Men are cut off from one another, and under the leadership of Mel Gibson's character they must withstand the modern equivalent of Custer's Last Stand.  Part of the grand tradition of Vietnam war movies is edgy, paranoid atmosphere. When watching Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket, you get the edgy, I'm-going-to-snap-soon feeling.  Another almost necessary feature of Vietnam movies is questioning the war itself.  One of the most poignant and powerful moments in Full Metal Jacket is the very last scene where the soldiers are marching in the dusk singing the theme song to the Mickey Mouse Club.  You can really get into the psyche of that generation and the rage and protest it felt against the war.  We Were Soldiers, on the other hand. does not examine the war or capture that generation's rage against it.  Instead, We Were Soldiers sadly plays like more of a conventional war film.  The movie starts with Gibson training his boys and being a family man.  There is one moment where the men are standing in the woods during training, listening to a radio transmission filled with gunfire.  Gibson comments on the importance of training and that on the battlefield there are no second chances.  The men look appropriately somber.  Then the film moves to Vietnam itself.  The strong points of the film are the battle scenes.  While not wholly accurate (the Vietnamese did not pile up their dead bodies), the battles are realistic, sometimes terribly realistic.  One young soldier gets burnt and his flesh melts.  The rest of the film alternates between the battle and the wives at home getting letters saying their husbands have been killed and how the wives unite together to support those lost.  A reporter comes to the battle and later tells the soldiers' story.  Overall, the film is rather a disappointment.  While I was fairly certain it wouldn't come anywhere near Apocalypse Now, against which all other Vietnam films should be gauged, I was hoping it would capture the uncertainty and constant questioning of why we were in Nam in the first place.  While it is a true story, the  writers could have better captured that generation's attitude toward the war while keeping true to the facts.  Since it details the first encounter, they could have dealt with the soldiers realizing that maybe Vietnam isn't where they're supposed to be at, or get a more accurate shot of trying to figure out just why they're here.    In the end, We Were Soldiers becomes this rather dazzling paradox.  While it remains true to the facts of the story itself, it does not stay true to the political climate of the 1960s, creating this rather bizarre hybrid of accurate journalism as far as the microcosmic level is concerned (the details of the battle itself), but is just flat-out wrong on the macrocosmic level goes (the counterculture's reaction against Vietnam)  In the end, the more patriotism-oriented themes of We Were Soldiers is far better suited to a film dealing with WW II, not Vietnam.    -Written as Newspaper review in 2002 (released on Amazon.co.uk in 2007) and for whatever reason I never released this on the main Amazon site
B006B3975Y|5.0|Beautiful, well crafted. The feel of true hip-hop not that new rap crap. Implementing The Roots ability to play (play meaning actual instruments) real music. If you are musically diverse then this is your album. Of you want this album just know this is not your regular rap album for dummies like like Jay Z and club music. This is a musically intelligent diverse album. If your sitting around smoking weed and drinking everyday and your babies momma is at home with your kids that you haven't seen in a few days or more, or because you have been out making that money on the streets this album is above your intelligence.
B005J29HCQ|5.0|AAt last, we get The Beach Boys' follow up to PET SOUNDS as a cohesive, finished work.  At least, that's what Disk 1 of the set would like you to believe.  Ultimately, however, this set, while precious and invaluable, just shows you how truly unfinished SMiLE always was, although Brian Wilson came tantalizing close to actually pulling the album off.  Ultimately, the 2004 BRIAN WILSON PRESENTS SMiLE remains the definitive word on the album, and I intend to show you what I mean by that.  Before we get into the history and all the tangled details, let me just say this.  Despite the incomplete nature of the recordings, it is truly amazing to hear The Beach Boys' SMiLE and how endlessly inventive and truly daring Wilson had became during the year period of late 1966 into 1967.  The work is amazing, and stands head and shoulders taller than anything has that is currently out there in today's current market.  If you love music and you want to be amazed, you owe it to yourself and to Wilson to hear this material (both the 2011 Beach Boys version and the 2004 solo version).  For the record, I do prefer SMiLE over SGT. PEPPER  As a set, Mark Linette (The Beach Boys' main engineer for the last twenty years and overseeing their archiving project which has been going on for the last twenty years), with the consent of the band, has fully presented the \\"what might have been album\\" and all the various sessions in masterful sonic quality.  Linette and his team really outdid themselves and the `finished' project sounds great.  For casual fans, the two disk set will suffice, as the second disk provides highlights of the various sessions.  For those looking to dive headlong into the lore of the project should opt for the five disk set along with all the packaging and vinyl disks.  However, be aware the four disks of sessions outtakes are exactly that.  Much of the session tapes are Wilson talking to the backing band (Phil Spector's Wrecking Crew) working on getting the right sound.  Incontrast to all the stories and mythology that has grown up around the album, the session tapes reveal Brian in total control, very professional, and tightly focused on getting his vision down in sound, despite all the so called shenanigans that were going on.  A big appeal to SMiLE, and something that would be amiss if not mentioned, is the interactive nature and intellectual space the project has come to occupy.  Just like Charles Dicken's \\"The Mystery of Edwin Drood\\", there have been literally hundreds of fan mixes of SMiLE , attemping to bring order to the fragments left behind.  The most interesting of these are often pre 2004, as after 2004 most of the mixes modeled themselves after the 2004 version. With all the new material and sessions officially released, even with a Beach Boys version now sanctioned and in existence, hopefully the fan community will keep mixing and creating their own versions of SMiLE!  Then there is also the debate on what the 1967 version would actually have been.  Simply put, there is no 1967 version, nor was the track sequence decided until 2004.There have been some voices complaining in the fan community about how the real SMiLE was the notorious 12 track list provided by Capital from an unknown source (thought to be Brian) and used on the 1967 album covers.  However, when shown the list in 2006, Brian said he had never seen the list before.  The chief speculation is the source was either Carl Wilson, or possibly Brian's sister-in-law, Diane Rovell.  Another big issue that has come up with this release has been the \\"three sided\\" SMiLE.  The vinyl version has SMiLE divided into three sides, with the fourth side as bonus tracks, which the detractors say would never have been had the album been released in 1967.  While it's true SMiLE would not have been configured that way back in the 1960s, the detractors are missing a key point - the album as it stands now is only 48 minutes long.  The album could easily have been put on a single vinyl record.  With the exception of Bob Dylan's first album, Dylan's five albums of the early to mid 1960s were all in the forty five to fifty minute range, with HIGHWAY 61 REVISTED clocking in at 51 minutes.  Throughout history, for various reasons (death, lack of interest, external pressure, perfectionism, etc), we have been left with unfinished art.  These include Chaucer's THE CANTERBURY TALES, Dickens' THE MYSTERY OF EDWARD DROOD, Kafka's novels, Virgil's THE ANEID (which is only unfinished in a few minor places), etc.  As far the rock `canon', the most famous case of this is, naturally, The Beach Boys 1967 follow up to PET SOUNDS.  The story is the stuff of legend.  Brian Wilson scores a smash (though not commercially) with PET SOUNDS who influences everyone from The Beatles and George Martin on down.  Where to go from there is the natural question.  The answer:  nowhere but up.  Wilson was going to use the same recording techniques he pioneered with the 1966 single \\"Good Vibrations\\", recording short \\"feels\\" or \\"modules\\", and then literally constructing the album out of these feels with tapes and a razor blade (remember, this is 1966/1967 - no Pro Tools for these guys!)  Over nine months (nice gestation number, that), Wilson does over 80 recording sessions, generally loses grip with reality in a drug fueled haze of LSD and amphetamine's, shelves the entire project and goes on strike, leaving The Beach Boys to issue the bizarre (even by 1967 standards) SMILELY SMILE.  That's the official story anyway.  Like any good myth, it's not quite accurate.  (I have even seen a website that argued SMiLE became SMILY SMILE.  The argument on that website was largely based on the 12 track listing, which when you remove Brian Wilson's name from that list the whole argument on the website crumbles).    Given the unfinished nature of SMiLE, it is, perhaps, enlightening to compare this to another unfinished work,  in this case J. R. R. Tolkien's THE SILMARILLION.  The differencesare more marked than the similarities between SMiLE and THE SILMARILLION; however, we can learn a thing or two by comparing them.  Tolkien began earnestly writing his legendarium in 1917 in the form of THE BOOK OF LOST TALES (though there are some scattered poems dating as early as 1914, and, according to Tolkien's letters, he began creating Arda, of which Middle-earth is a subregion or continent, as early as 1908).  Tolkien worked on THE SILMARILLION his entire adult life, with the exception of a thirteen to fourteen year period between 1938 to 1951 when he was busy writing THE LORD OF THE RINGS.  He died in 1973 at the age of eighty one, leaving behind a massive proliferation of manuscripts, all competing versions, for his son Christopher to sort through.  And that's exactly what Christopher Tolkien did.  He issued THE SILMARILLION in 1977, four years after Tolkien died.    In 1983 (not counting the 1979 book UNFINISHED TALES, whose success largely spurred the subsequent posthumous volumes), Christopher began his twelve volume THE HISTORY OF MIDDLE-EARTH series, which he finished in 1996 with THE PEOPLES OF MIDDLE EARTH.  This is relevant to SMiLE and Brian Wilson in several ways.  The first, and to this listener the most important, is that when THE SILMARILLION was finally published, it was done posthumously, because Tolkien, like Wilson, could not bring his work to completion.  For serious readers, this brings serious questions of the validity of the published text as it relates to Tolkien's work.  There are also serious questions of how canonical and authoritative is the 1977 SILMARILLION, as Tolkien was not alive to make the final decisions.  Personally, I feel the published text would have been quite a bit longer had Tolkien lived to see his work to completion.    THE HISTORY OF MIDDLE EARTH only compounds the problem, as Christopher admits on numerous occasions that what he discerns as his father's most likely last intent on a given subject was not actuallyused in the 1977 text.  For example, Findis and Irimë, who are daughters of King Finwe and sisters to Fingolfin, Finarfin, and half-sister to Feanor, do not appear in the published text, though they probably should have.  Christopher also admits to writing most of Chapter 22 in the book, of which most of the essential features of the story have no real authority in the elder Tolkien's work at all.  SMiLE, on the other hand, has a completely different set of problems due to its' artistic medium - music.  The first, and biggest problem, is that SMiLE, in its original incarnation, simply cannot be finished.    The reason why it cannot be finished? Because it can only be edited and configured, it cannot be added too. And SMiLE  (meaning the 1966-67 Beach Boys sessions) desperately needs to be added too.  Simply listening to the record reveals how truly incomplete and fragmented Brian left the album in late 1967.  The album is entirely too top heavy on instrumental, or primarily instrumental tracks.  For all the love for The Beach Boys' vocals, honestly the vocal parts simply aren't as numerous or as frequent, the reason being much of the vocal work was not recorded nor given a final form.  A major example of this is \\"Do You Like Worms?\\".  The lyrics on the 2004 version are vintage 1966 lines Van Dyke wrote but were not recorded.  Another major example is the key track, \\"Surf's Up\\", was not even given a final edit or even recorded all the way.  \\"Surf's Up\\" was assembled from the pieces available.  They have the piano demo and also the first half of the track.  The second half, which the archivists think was recorded but are uncertain on that point, has gone missing in the intervening forty four years since it was supposedly recorded.  \\"Surf's Up\\" 2011 is not what \\"Surf's Up \\" 1967 would have been simply because Wilson would have recorded the last half and would not have to piecemeal the track from various versions simply because that's all he could do.    And really, that's the heart of the problem with the original 1960s sessions for SMiLE.  Whereas Tolkien worked on his book for most of his life, Wilson only did primary work on SMiLE for a little under a year.  Tolkien worked on THE SILMARILLION for almost all of his adult life.  However, the medium of writing is kinder than the medium of music.  If Tolkien went back to a 1930s text and worked on it in the 1960s, then probably no one would be any the wiser because the medium is so drastically different.  That is another key difference between Tolkien and Wilson.    However, if The Beach Boys of today added vocals to truly finish the album, loads of fans would scream (and rightfully so) foul, because there would be such a disconnect from The Beach Boys' vocal capabilities of 2011 compared to 1966-1967.  The purists were put off when Mick Jagger put on additional vocals to EXILE ON MAINSTREET outtakes in 2010 and Bruce Springsteen did some overdubbing for the release of his album THE PROMISE, comprise of material recorded during DARKNESS ON THE EDGE OF TOWN (they weren't really outtakes, they were just material recorded in congruence with that masterpiece of an album).  Also,  Brian's the only one left of the three Wilson brothers.  Dennis drowned in 1983 and Carl died in 1998.  So what is the solution to this conundrum?  Why, to start fresh, record all the material anew, bring Van Dyke to complete the lyrical work, and actually finish the album.  And that is what Brian Wilson has done . . . all the way back in 2004.  I know there has been been debate that Darian Sahanaja, a leader of Wilson's backing band the Wondermints,, and Domenic Priore, author of LOOK, LISTEN, VIBRATE, SMILE and Smile: The Story of Brian Wilson's Lost Masterpiece were influences on that project, especially in the tracking sequence.  Regardless of there is any validity to these concerns, the fact is Brian Wilson and Van Dyke Parks returned to SMiLE in 2003 and finished it, presenting it as a complete and coherent work.       And what is the main problem with the 2004 SMiLE?  The fact that it is not the vintage tapes and those are not 1960s Beach Boys vocals.  When Wilson released the 2004 SMiLE, a lot of fans were happy but a large faction wanted The Beach Boys' stunning vocals and harmonies, which, as wonderful as The Wondermints are, they are simply no Beach Boys, and 2004 Brian Wilson cannot compare to 1967 Brian Wilson.  Even though Wilson was able to complete the album 37 years later, the completed version of 2004 is not what everyone  wanted.  But if you want to know the final form of SMiLE, and how it should stand as a completed, work, the 2004 SMiLE is the logical conclusion to this famous album's story.    Listening to The Beach Boys' version of SMiLE, as opposed to the 2004 SMiLE, is like sifting through an incomplete manuscript with various lacunas and missing pages when the finished draft is sitting right next to it.  The 2004 album is filled with vocals and overall the work sounds finished.  What were once instrumentals (Holiday, Look) now have lyrics.  There is cohesion and the logical flow.  There simply is not the same narrative sweep to the 1967 SMiLE as there is to the 2004 SMiLE, and that's because the lyrics were either not written or not recorded.  The 2011 SMiLE sounds exactly like what it is - incomplete, but still wonderful.  And also, what the 2004 finished version demonstrated (and the 2011 Sessions explicitly proved) is Wilson was not that far away from completing his work back in 1967, at least musically.  Wilson simply reworked the material already in existence, and added the missing vocals and lyrics.  Although there are new lyrics in the 2004 version, there is no new music that was not already recorded in 1966-1967.  Another piece of evidence that demonstrates the 2004 version is the definitive and finished form is the 2011 version follows the 2004 tracklisting exactly, with one minor exception (placing the linking track \\"I'm In Great Shape\\" to earlier in the album, which sequeways quite nicely into \\"Barnyard\\" and sonically sounds like a match.   So even though we now have an official version of SMiLE from the original tapes, SMiLE still remains an elusive, tantalizing \\"What could have been\\" scenario that will can never be fully answered.  At least, not by the 1966-67 tapes anyway, or even the 2004 version.  Though the 2004 album does present the work as finished, we can never know what would have happened had Wilson finished the project in 1967, nor what a finished 1967 album would have even been or sounded like, as so much of the vocal work was left incomplete and then the months of tape editing required to finish the project never happened.  And it's quite possible the track listing would have been completely different. There were plans [there was talk] about having talking tracks in between the songs (like \\"Brian Fell into a Piano\\" and the Vegetables comedy bit).  We'll never know how a 1967 SMiLE would have completed with SGT. PEPPER or if The Beach Boys' late 1960s career would have differed had SMiLE been critically acclaimed and praised.  Most likely it would have been like PET SOUNDS and not sold that well.  I am glad though Wilson did live to complete his version in 2004, and he oversaw the production and release of the 2011 Sessions box.  That gives both versions of the album an authority the project would never have had if Wilson died before the material was released, like Tolkien.  Had he died we could have had any number of different competing versions, just like Jimi Hendrix's numerous posthumous albums all attempting to approximate what his fourth LP would have been (though reasonable FIRST RAYS OF THE NEW RISING SUN, despite the terrible cover, may very well be a reasonable approximation, despite the presence of the 1968 outtake \\"My Friend\\" which most likely would NOT have been on a fourth LP by Hendrix).  And though we'll never know what a 1967 SMiLE would have been, we can be quite thankful Wilson finished the work in 2004 and (finally!) [even] officially released The Beach Boy's Frankenstein version in 2011!    Ultimately, SMiLE has come to symbolize the unrealized utopian ideals and what if possibilities of the 1960s counter culture.  That was not Wilson's intent when recording, but that is the role the album plays in our culture's history.  The album has always been perfect because it was always on the cusp of becoming, but did not fully arrive.  That is why SMiLE has been such a highly personal record for so many people  - it was never clearly defined what SMiLE actually WAS, so you could make and sequence to your hearts content, and that be just as valid as someone else's attempt to make SMiLE.  I'm just glad Wilson's reconstruction has finally been authorized, and we get a glimpse of what could have been, though not, perhaps, for the last time.  I believe the release of the Sessions has just expanded the mythos behind the album, not settled it.  I feel SMiLE will live far beyond our time, simply because of the great narrative feel of the story and the amazing finish the project got.  It only took us forty four years and a solo version to get there.  There are happy endings (and new beginnings) in this world after all.  Bravo Brian!

The music is so incredibly well suited to Amy's current lyrics and incredible voice.  Amy writes truth.  Her songs are gut level honest.  Nothing is sugar coated unless there is a smirk along with it.  I LOVE this recording.  I so wish she had not left me so soon.  I know that was the true statement of one selfish fan!  It's just that her style and talent were precious.  Alcohol kills as fast as any other drug.  I am sad that it killed her.
0385474547|5.0|Chinua Achebe's first novel, Things Fall Apart, serves as both a fable of Africa before and after its first encounters with Europeans and as an examination of the way many of Achebe's readers still see African colonialism. Okonkwo overcomes his father's legacy, rises to greatness, is defeated by his own hubris and flaws, then is ultimately overcome by the Christian inquest into Africa which is incapable of seeing his life for more than an interesting, though impotent, rebellion against Europe's brand of civilization.  Okonkwo's world is at once accessible and deep, allowing the reader, no matter how different his background might be from that of Achebe or Okonkwo himself, to appreciate the humanity of the Africans who were viewed as primitive savages by European colonizers. It is profoundly important to examine the European abuse of Africans and Africa if one hopes to understand how colonialism and the treatment of Africa by foreign invaders has left Africa in such distress even decades after imperialist powers directed their interest toward Asia and the Middle East. Things Fall Apart offers a heartfelt and tragic story of how the relationship between Africa and Europeans worked.
B002ZG98VO|2.0|I see I'm not the only one that has noticed that the BluRay disc will not resume play after hit the stop button or some 30-sec after hitting pause.  The movie is just OK.  I loved Richard Crowe in some of his other movies but he simply doesn't fit this one well considering the way his role was cast.  The storyline is interesting enough but the title should be \\"The Making of Robin Hood\\" as the movie ends with him becoming that character.  The movie is too dark and doesn't do a good job revealing the visual detail the producers spent so much money on.

B004NSVF7C|3.0|The book begins with the author getting a \\"borrowed\\" copy of a German <<Krautterbuch>> published in 1630. The book was, in effect, stolen from a university library yet she keeps it and seems to have a struggle with that for the entire length of her book. Ostensibly the book is about a pathological book thief but it  has a bit too much of the amateurish psychological intrusions. The author also seems to think that every ABAA member is an honest saint and every non-member is not to be trusted.   All this aside, it's an OK read if one is interested in book collecting, but it could be much shorter. The writing is not so good that one savors the read and I was glad when I finished it.
B005FMZVLQ|4.0|First, these big Invicta watches are things you either like or don't like. I have three of them already and I like them. They're big and a bit clunky, but that's the look and one should expect it. And they are well made.  When reviewing, I generally like to comment on things that aren't obviousy to someone browsing the item, and that's especially true of how something looks. I'm making an exception in this case because while this is sort of a typical Invicta face, the large, almost-Deco numerals and the very chunky ends of the minute and hour hands are different than other Invictas of this type that I've come across. At first I really didn't like the looks of the dial, and felt it was too 'in  your face' (even compared to Invicta's usual stuff) but they grew on me, and it's very very easy to tell the time (despite the chronograph dials making the face busy) without glasses (I'm far-sighted).  IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT BAND MATERIAL: The band is described as being \\"cloth\\" but that's not the whole story. It's cloth on the outside (sort of feels like an upscale canvas) but the cloth is sewn onto a leather strap. It lends the band a nice thickness, but do be aware that what you will feel against your skin is leather and not cloth.  Note that while the title doesn't say so, this is what Invicta calls a \\"lefty\\" because the control dials are on the left rather than the right. I wear my watch on my left wrist, and I find this works fine.  Having worn this watch a bit, one thing that I didn't think I'd even notice, but which I do, and which I don't care for, is the extent to which the second hand stands out. It's red (everything else is white) and large (it's not on a subdial), and I find that it draws the eye enough to be distracting. Objectively speaking, it's not a big thing, but subliminally I seem to notice it and it'll probably result in my wearing the watch less than I otherwise would.
B004H7QICG|4.0|This box is very well made.  There was plenty of room inside even for my after market CPU heatsink (COOLER MASTER Hyper 212).

I say this because this is my second Antec box with sound proof sides and I think this newer model is louder.
030788743X|5.0|The Da Vinci Code.  The Quest for the Grail.  Let's be honest - we love treasure hunt stories.  Ready Player One is a twist on the treasure hunt genre in its linking of two futures (2044/OASIS) to the the decade of the 1980s.<br /><br />I remember Zork!  It was the first and last game I got totally into (so OK, gaming isn't for everyone).  But the lure is real and author Ernest Cline captures the 1980s - the span of text games through stand-alone video games to computer multi-player role playing games as well as the music, the food and so much more - so extraordinarily well, seamlessly blending IRL (In Real Life) with virtual reality of past and future, that you know he's a Master himself.<br /><br />I highly recommend Ready Player One, even if you never were into games or even the 1980s.  But now I gotta go spruce up my avatar.

0553801503|2.0|There is no way to save the series completely at this point (especially after reading A Dance with Dragons reviews). George R.R. Martin is likely not going to be compared to J.K. Rowling or Tolkien 50 years from now (or even Frank Herbert who really only wrote one great book). Even with some amazing concluding books, will people actually be able to just skip the nearly pointless meanderings of A Feast For Crows? On its own this book is boring. Connected to the previously amazing series, its nearly torture.  Let me tell you where I am coming from. I've read all the books this year about 2 months apart so I did not have wait for the last few books to come out 4/5 years apart. Feast of Crows is REALLY that much weaker than the first three books, about 25% into the book I just couldn't resist reading reviews to see if I was not alone in my feeling.  Martin is likely aware of what has happened to the series in his heart, which must make it all that much harder to write more. Its like a band that had an amazing debut album (or 2) but have since lost the magic. I don't wish Martin any harm, but the series would have been better off if he had a heart attack before writing Feast of Crows (and apparently Dance with Dragons...). At this rate, he won't finish the series anyway.  Don't get me wrong, there are handful of good aspects to stories in FFC, but as a whole there is very little suspense, reason to care about the characters, or anticipation of future events. This book really stinks of free writing - absolutely no planing. I am listening to the audio-book and made it about 80% through and realized I didn't care enough anymore to pay attention. I found myself constantly re-listening to parts because I missed what was going on as my mind wandered.  In some ways this whole result is funny in that he managed by starting such a masterpiece to convince thousands of fans to feel compelled to read these last two giant books with the patience and forgiveness of loving children. It's religious in nature. I would say don't read this book but I know that won't help you. That advice would not have helped me. Just be prepared for something less, and maybe you can manage to be disappointed less than you would otherwise have been.  - - - -  Note that 3rd book has a rating of 4.7 (excellence above almost all else) and FFC is 3.7 (good enough for lovers of the genre).

0307277887|2.0|Having watched and enjoyed the first five seasons of the television series, I thought I'd have a crack at the first book. I was hoping it would flesh out the story and the characters. Unfortunately this wasn't the case.   The narrative is in the first person and, like the TV series, you see events from Dexter's point of view. There is nothing wrong with that, of course, but one learns nothing more about the character from the book than is present from the TV series. Whilst the character does have a certain dark humour, this is much better developed on the screen than on the page. If anything, Dexter is a little annoying as he's almost fatalistic, often \\"knowing things\\" without knowing why, talking about auras and other such rubbish. Not what you'd expect of the smart, scientific, blood spatter analyst. All other characters are woefully underdeveloped and one-dimensional. The author seems to have chosen a fast-paced plot in lieu of interesting characters: the book is fairly short and would be easy for a fast reader to finish in a day. I can't say I care for the writing style, either: blandness marked by the heavy-handed use of alliteration, which becomes trite after the first page. Despite this, the book is readable and I imagine it would feel like more of a page-turner were I unfamiliar with the plot. Indeed, the book does pick up at the denouement where it differs substantially from what was screened and, contrary to my expectations, I do feel like blasting through the next one. Still, if you've seen the series on television, you aren't missing much here.

B00127RAJY|4.0|I have to say that I never watched The Biggest Loser, and had minimal exposure to who, exactly, Jillian Michaels was before purchasing this video.  I just knew that I wanted an exercise video that would help whip me into shape and not require all sorts of fitness balls, rubber bands, and clamps on my doorjambs.  So when I read the reviews for this video, I was interested.  A 20 minute workout that I had the possibility of losing a good amount of weight and get in shape???Heck Yeah, that was mine.  I don't do the workout every day, as she wants. I rotate between this video and a popular dance workout every other day.  But on the days that I do this video I feel like I got the most out of my time!  I have worked my way to Level two for now, and admit to a few whimpers by the time we get to the ending plank oblique twists.  But I wouldn't have it any other way.  The workouts are slightly longer than the 20 minutes, but you don't mind the white lie when you see how strong you seem to be getting.  I can't wait to work myself up to Level 3!

The setting, the characters, and the heartbreaks were just as I pictured as I was reading the book. The three characters that were most memorable to me most were, Miss Skeeter, Aibileen, and Minny. Miss Skeeter was so memorable not only because she was a main character, but also because she was doing what she believed in regardless of what other people were saying about her. I loved the character of Aibileen because of how passionate she was about doing her job even though she was a maid. Aibileen was a loyal person and friend throughout the whole movie. Minny added a lot of comedy to the movie. She had a witty personality and stood up for herself against her bosses. You see a lot of these three characters in the movie and I feel like they all make the movie seem so much more real because of the emotions that they have throughout the whole film. I think these characters were very well casted and were captivating throughout the movie from beginning to end.   The plot of the film was extraordinary because it covered a variety of topics. The main topics you see are inequality and racism; these topics are portrayed throughout the whole movie because the book Miss Skeeter is writing to show the hardships that the maids have faced throughout their lives. The film touches upon friendship; the movie shows how strong of a bond the maids have with each other. For example when the maid Yule May gets arrested for stealing Miss Hilly's ring Aibileen tries to help her and again when Minny loses her job Aiblieen puts in a good word for her when Miss Celia calls. They all look out for each other when as if they were a big family because of the bond they have from being maids.    The camera shot that stood out to me more than any other shot is when Aibileen is leaving Miss Leefolts' house at the end of the movie. For me that shot gave so much more meaning to what was going on in the film because it just made it seem more real that Aibileen was finally free from everything. Although it was sad for me to watch Aibileen leave \\"baby girl\\" it was such an uplifting moment to see Aibileen finally freed from her life as a maid.    Another scene that stood out to me was after Yule May was arrested for stealing Miss Hilly's ring; the entire cast of maids gathered at Aibileens house to help Miss Skeeter with the book.  That scene was such a joyful moment in the movie for me, to see that everyone was going to start helping and saying what they have wanted to say all along.  A scene that made the movie realistic to me was when Miss Skeeter was leaving the library and Aibileen was reading out loud the rules for \\"separate but equal\\". This scene gave so much emotion and depth to what was going on during the time period.     I felt that the writing of the movie was extraordinary because of how true it stayed to the book. I was not expecting the film to be almost identical to the book. Although they have left out a few parts that were in the book the film still gave me that heart wrenching and cheerful feeling I had while I was reading the book. I think that the film was just as easy to watch and get captured in as the book was. I wanted to keep watching to find out what was going to happen next. The writing was very simple it was not confusing to follow and it gave the audience the opportunity to focus on their emotions because of how plainly they were described.    The film fits into the 1960's time period it was based on because of the places they used and how the characters dressed. Since they used southern plantation homes it and small town areas the film brought you back to that time period. The actions taking place in the film also brought the viewers back to the time period. They talk about historical events in the film it made me think of how far the American Society has come since those events and howwe are still evolving. With the help of the settings and actors it was not hard for me to go back into that time period.    Overall, the film was just as captivating as the book. Just like the book I could watch the movie a million times and never be disappointed. I think that the characters were casted extremely well; everyone from Miss Skeeter to baby girl, I think that they all depicted who I was imaging in my head as I was reading the book. I was nervous the film would ruin the book for me but I was surprised to see that the film was as amazing as the book was.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I am  not a Stephen King fan.  Apart from \\"The Shining\\" (which remains one of the best modern books I have ever read) I don't typically like King's stuff.  Every now and again, I will try his latest tome and usually find I haven't changed my mind.  That happened with \\"Under the Dome\\", although - like this book - the majority seemed to like it.  I gave this one a shot because the time travel premise was attractive and you don't have to wait long before that kicks in, front & center in the story.  The romance (it IS a love story, primarily... not just with Jake/George & Sadie. but with Jake & the 1950s as well).  The premise of going back and correcting \\"wrongs\\", having to endure a \\"reset\\" and do it all again as the wrongs you need to right pile up, would have made for a faster pace and ultimately a more interesting concept. All that waiting around for 11/22/63, with its subsequent filler, was what a lot of low-star reviewers (justifiably) complained about.  It is King's writing style for the most part that I can't get along with. Gore you expect (after all most of them are horror stories) but too often he includes gross details which seem juvenile and superfluous.  In 11/22/63 there was none of either, if there had been I would have given up just as I have before.   The other thing I don't like about King's books, however, exists in abundance in 11/22/63.  Slangy, adolescent terminology which comes perilously close to lazy writing.  Indeed, the negative reviews cite this time and again as one of the chief complaints.  I will admit several times I almost gave up because of it.  There are sentences you read and think \\"really...  you couldn't put it better than that?\\".  Many detractors of 11/22/63 ask why King doesn't have an editor. As such a mega-star I suppose he isn't forced to have one. Certainly, this book was looong and a little judicious editing might have shortened it somewhat removed some of the more jaring slang into the bargain  OK, all that said...  4 stars?  Despite the wordiness, the preachiness, the slang (all of which is mentioned consistently in the 1 and 2 star reviews) I just couldn't put it down.  I had several nights of reading into the wee small hours with 11/22/63 and it \\"stole\\" my precious Saturday afternoon nap because I just HAD to finish it.  I ended up saying it was one of the best books I had read in a long time. I still think so, despite the fact that I read the one-star reviews and agreed with everything they said about the book's flaws.  Overall, a good - not fast and sometimes irritating - read.  If King's typical writing style doesn't usually bother you, you will likely join the 5 star reviewers.
B0000A98ZP|4.0|thanks for the fast service. dvd arrived on schedule and was new as stated. will look you use you again in the future
B004GYY714|4.0|I love it except the only thing is that sometimes it takes a while to load a station and sometimes it stops in the middle of a song for few seconds but other than that, it's amazing!
0634049011|5.0|Clear and important fundamentals for any one wishing to get some good licks on their guitar!  This book is organized very well and covers much of the stuff that many of us just skip over but live to regret later.
B005HSL626|2.0|There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with the gameplay itself...it's incredibly smooth, with great colors and fun sound effects.  However, there are waaay too many ads, popping up every 90 seconds at least,  and totally blocking the screen.  Spring for the paid version.
0439813786|5.0|I have wanted to read this book for ages: the comic book meets novel concept was immediately appealing.  A little free time this weekend and I finally had the chance to step into this beautiful world of France between the wars.  The illustrations are fantastic, the story line engrossing, the writing enjoyable.  Sure, it's a quick read but the little time you spend with Hugo, Isabelle and Papa Georges will be well worth it.  Can't wait to see if Scorsese did it justice.
B0025UHKNS|2.0|I really like the idea of this GPS but in the end it doesn't deliver. I have had this since May and have used it a fair bit. I also have an edge 705 and 800 that I compared it to.   First off the battery life is not good and seems variable. After a full charge I usually get 4 hours but sometimes less by an hour. Advertised as a 6 hour battery but I have never gotten 6 hours of GPS time out of it.  And mainly it is very likely that it will get turned off during use, probably 50% of the time it gets turned off by my wrist hitting the stop button or when I pull on a jacket and sometimes I just don't know but I get back from a ride or run and it is off. The start/reset buttons should be on the face to eliminate this issue.   I would not recommend this for anyone unless you just run with no gloves or other clothing that would accidently turn it off.
B00007KWHN|4.0|Well, you've read enough about this album to know its historical context, who made it etc. All I can add really is my own journey to Yes ... which started about 30 years ago I guess, when I bought the then, newly-released \\"Classic Yes\\" basically for no reason other than that I liked Roger Dean's cover artwork, and I listened and really hated it - just couldn't get into the singer (Jon Anderson)'s high-pitched voice. Since then I've had a number of people that are \\"serious\\" about music try to get me into this band and I have always resisted, until this year, for some reason I decided to buy \\"Fragile\\" and I told myself it was worth playing it until I \\"Got it\\", so I persevered, and I'm so glad I did.  Yes music is often very immersive - long intricate songs you can listen to on headphones and really lose yourself in. I listen while I'm jogging and have really come to dig them over the past couple of months. Well, I have all the records now from their legendary \\"good run\\", starting with \\"The Yes Album\\" and going through to \\"Going For The One\\". Out of all of them \\"The Yes Album\\" and \\"Fragile\\" are personal favourites, being both imbued with plenty of catchy bits, great riffs and progressions, while developing those amazing arrangements and incredible musicianship the band would become known for. My own personal high point on this album is \\"Wurm\\" - the last part of \\"Starship Trooper\\" - just fantastic. Theres a lot of magic on this record, so if, like me, you are resistant to it because of Anderson's voice, or for whatever other resaon, I encourage you to persevere - you'll probably find it's worth it.
B005P89F1C|5.0|Two things you need to know about me:<br /><br />1) I'm addicted to Christmas music, in every genre, except nasty-sarcastic albums. I have over 100+ Christmas themed music, ranging from classic Old School like The Ray Conniff Singers, Burl Ives, and Bing Crosby to Holly Cole, Noel Lorica and Dixieland Christmas. When no one is around to bother, I listen to Christmas music throughout the year, so a great album receives year 'round air play.<br /><br />2) I'm 60 years young.<br /><br />Unlike many of my contemporaries, I DO know who Justin Bieber is. Although I didn't own any of his albums prior to this one, I enjoyed listening to him on the radio when a song came into play. Because I own a Zune Pass for unlimited downloads, I was able to give a solid listen to his 1st Christmas album, with NO FEAR of wasting a single penny if it sucked.<br /><br />What.A.Surprise! Not only did I end up listening to the entire album THREE TIMES, back to back, but I coughed up the money to actually OWN the album, which is the highest compliment I can pay an artist. I've got to say, that this album is my greatest musical delight of the holiday season! My absolute favourite track is \\"The Drummer Boy\\"---utterly sick!!! A background of a drum corp with tight raps and vocals, it is the BEST and HAPPIEST rendition of a usually sad and weepy song. \\"Home This Christmas\\" has a nice dose of Country twang, and should please any Taylor Swift fans (or Shania Twain). \\"Silent Night\\" just features Justin's voice, which is pure and simple in this classic song. \\"Fa La La\\" has such amazing a cappella vocals that I'd love an entire Christmas music filled with this type of music!<br /><br />There are songs that sound identical to Michael Jackson, when he was young and untainted. Rhythm and Blues? Got that, too! My friends trust my musical tastes so when I've emailed or called each of them and shouted, \\"You've GOT to listen to Bieber's latest album!\\", I received a shocked, \\"Oh-kay? Really? BIEBER? Well, if you say so.\\" 100% of them have come back, as shocked and delighted as I was, saying, \\"I NEVER would have given this album a listen if you hadn't recommended it.\\" This comes from friends who only listen to Michael Buble or Lady Antebellum.<br /><br />Bottom line: Bieber isn't just for Teens/Tweens, any more. Just as kids should give Tony Bennet a listen, then Old Fogy's should give this 17 year old's first Christmas album a serious listen. Based on this sole album, I firmly believe that Bieber will have a long and fruitful career, for decades to come.<br /><br />Merry Christmas, Justin, and Bieber fans, too!ked and delighted as I was, saying, \\"I NEVER would have given this album a listen if you hadn't recommended it.\\" This comes from friends who only listen to Michael Buble or Lady Antebellum.  Bottom line: Bieber isn't just for Teens/Tweens, any more. Just as kids should give Tony Bennet a listen, then Old Fogy's should give this 17 year old's first Christmas album a serious listen.

B0063IH60K|5.0|Works just fine very fun I play it a lot on my kindle fire couldn't get any better I really enjoy playing it
B006JPS1OM|5.0|easy ,fun , light enough to see when looking for objects. will play until solved flashes are easy to see
B0010SKUYM|5.0|There's a lot of long reviews about this book, so I'll keep mine short:<br /><br />Great character, great story.  I enjoyed this book from beginning to end, and definitely recommend it.
B005TBN04S|3.0|If you liked the first movie, you will probably like this one because they are virtually the same.  I knew this going in based on the reviews, and since I knew what to expect I still found most of it hilarious.  However, the vulgarity was beyond extreme.  It did not help the story and was not funny.  In fact it took away from the movie for me. The first one had its moments of raunchiness, but this one took it too far.
B004LWZW7E|2.0|In Time is based on an interesting concept: a dystopic society where everyone is given a preordained life span of 25 years, with the ability to buy, trade, spend, steal, kill, etc., for their allotted time, and then some. Unfortunately, a good concept does not necessarily extend itself to the formation of a well written, finely executed film.<br /><br />It begins interestingly enough, even allowing one to overlook Justin Timeberlake's one note acting skills, but soon becomes one long car chase/run from the bad guys bore-fest.<br /><br />Amanda Seyfried, an actor I usually enjoy, is exceptionally blah, as is Cillian Murphy and the forever smarmy Vincent Kartheiser. I blame the lazy, uninspired, script.<br /><br />There is much to be explored here, in a world where your bank account and lifespan are linked, but the film treads water, and is more concerned with surface than depth.<br /><br />It isn't even entertaining in a brain candy and popcorn B movie fashion; it's just dull, poorly acted, and boring. Save your time and money, and skip this one.<br /><br />Not recommended.
B004EPZ070|5.0|What a great movie!  Nice girls do finish first.  Kate Hudson was great as the obnoxious Darcy.  If you like Romantic comedy, this movie is for you!
B001R60ESE|5.0|Using only one word this BRDVD is \\"Magnificent\\"<br /><br />There are but a handful of living artist that if ever you get a chance to see you should at any cost and this is one.  Several of the others are on this very same disc.<br /><br />There are just a few moments in life where something happens that is larger than life itself. It is even rarer when you can see or hear these things happen.  Sometime we get lucky and put them in a format that we can enjoy forever.  This is one of those times and this is one of those recordings.  This recording is proof of a higher power and that something else other than man exists.<br /><br />Now that you have the blue ray disc player and several hundred dollars' worth of speakers, this is the performance your system has been waiting for. I'm not saying you should listen to this, but that you need to listen to this.  Even if you don't have an overpriced system I have no doubt that the passion of these artist will infuse your heart, body, and soul.<br /><br />Get this BRDVD, and then get the CD for the car, and when he comes to town get TICKETS!
B002PEP4SC|4.0|This is a good book for what it is - B grade crime genre. The thing that lifts it for me is the connection to the TV series which I do enjoy. I love the additional character insights provided  by the written word that cannot be obtained by the visual medium. Also I love that this is the TV series writers impression of what the character Castle might have written. It adds an intriguing insight into the series while at the same time providing us with a readable and enjoyable book. Not great literature but enjoyable and fun.
B005O30Y5Y|1.0|this is  blue ray disc only. UltraViolet Digital Copy is not a copy that will play in a regular DVD player like the Digital Copy. amazon has blue ray disc with dvd disc for 5 dollars less [[ASIN:B001UV4XJ2 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 2 (Three-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo + UltraViolet Digital Copy)]] witch is a much better gift and a better deal. i will be ordering it as a replacement gift and regrettably i will then have purchased both
B004WGGQPQ|4.0|I have this for my HTC EVO and my Nook Color, they're both really fun but my only problem with the app is that I wish I could draw on top of the stickers.  app gets.5 stars from me if that ever changes :)
B005HSG3TC|5.0|when i first read all the bad reviews for this product, i was nervous that it was flimsy. when i got it, i was extremely happy with the case. the cover is pretty strong and the back is durable. i could definitely drop this and nothing would break (perfect for any accident prone people like me)!
B004W2UBYW|3.0|I felt this book focused far too much on the technical details of the products Steve Jobs created, rather than the life of Jobs himself.  The middle third of the book got particularly bogged down in these types of details; eventually I was skimming pages just to get through them. Towards the end of the book the author was repeating himself, as if the reader might have forgotten things they read in previous chapters. Overall I don't regret taking the time to read it, but I wish I had borrowed it rather than purchasing a copy myself.

B003O86FMW|5.0|I first heard of the hunger games series 2 weeks ago and let me tell you i am hooked!!! This is one of the very best series that i have read so far. Normally i wouldnt read something like this but Suzanne Collins has a way of writing things that can really reel someone in! im starting the 3rd book as we speak! I hope that suzanne collins more book! she is a fantastic author and i look foward to reading moe of her novels:)
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Great Movie everybody should see it a think the world around us will chance a lot. Since \\"Honor begins in our home\\"
B005POK858|5.0|I am amazed by this app. details are complex enough that keeping notes, such as where ooparts were found, which towns train for which skills and which towns sell which supplies are really helpful for future needs. In addition, each character has its own strengths and weaknesses. Choice of armor and weapons do matter, as each may have their owm strengths, and skills are limited by number and varients of them! I am not ashamed to say that I restarted the game twice as some of the character specific skills that I chose were not helpful later on, and could not be replaced.  It reminds me of the fun of the old Sega Genesis RPGs, but a lot more complex.
1451627289|5.0|Thank you Mr. King for writing 11.23.63.  The research for this book must have been incredible.  It is easy to suspend disbelief while following Jake through his journey.  It has prompted me to research that dreadful day and the people involved.  Like so many of Mr. Kings's other stories, the writing is well done and the story well crafted.  This book has a permanent place on my bookshelf.
B004P2CQM4|2.0|This is very cool toy, when it works.    Assembly is tedious, like assembling a complex piece of furniture from Ikea..with equally cryptic instructions that don't quite match the part labels.  But the big kicker with this thing is that you need to buy Helium to complete the assembly, so if you have a problem like I did (a defective gear box for the bit that shifts weight fore and aft.), you are screwed..  I am glad I purchased via Amazon, and am returning it, and will probably buy a replacement.  Someone at the office bought one, and we decided it would be much more fun if we could race them. (We have a perfect space for it.)  But all the anticipation was short lived when we carefully assembled it, and it would not work correctly due to the defective gearbox.    Having said that, the one I saw that made me decide to buy this one was working just fine after fixing an initial leak in the balloon. I also got good reports from my nephews who I sent one too.  Once you buy the helium tank, you are kinda committed, so I really didn't want to return mine, but after carefully examining it, I found the gearbox had a gear with a missing tooth - not something I could easily repair myself.  I never got a good flight out of mine due to this problem.  By the way, I did notice also that you can buy replacement balloons from Amazon (though not currently in stock.)  It's a cool, but delicate toy, not well made.  Despite the limitations, when it swims through the air it seems quite magical and life-like.  It's really beautiful and enchanting.  Hope that the maker addresses the quality issues!
B001BTZVFS|3.0|I ordered the Unrated version of the movie with the bonus digital copy. I received the order on time with a few other movies. Watched the movie and it was alright. Got to looking for the special features and realized they weren't there. Come to find out I had gotten a sealed, plastic wrapped double-sided (one for full screen, one for wide) copy of the RATED movie plus a digital copy of the unrated version in a box that said \\"Unrated\\". I was rather upset. I really only wanted to see the gag reel. Now I have to go through the hassle of returning it for the proper thing. Amazon's been pretty good about the return process thus far.  Movie itself was pretty good. Nice mix of raunchy humor, high school mentality and boyish charm. I'd seen it before but wanted the disk for my Tim Olyphant collection.
1451627289|4.0|11/22/63 is one of King's best later books.  What if you could change the past - for the better? Neither straight science fiction nor horror, this is a canny tale that explores complexity, immutability, and choice in our lives. But this never feels heavy or preachy - far from it. The central characters are wonderful, the plot avoids the many paradoxes inherent in a time-travel book, and the period detail feels perfect right.   I personally found the end unsatisfying, but still highly recommend the book.
B0063IH60K|4.0|cards are fairly easy to read and nice sized.  the games are usually winable without being too simple to be interesting.  i appreciate the infinite undo button and the auto move features.  great game, especially for free.  the popup ads are brief and not too intrusive.
B004UXUUDA|5.0|I loved this movie.  I hate to watch a movie before I've read the book it's based but on it was worth breaking that rule for \\"Sarah's Key\\".  An almost middle-aged journalist, Julia Jarmond, becomes interested in the Paris apartment she and her husband have inherited from his family.  As they begin to change it for their own use she begins to wonder about its history.  Who owned it before 1942 which is when her husband's family bought it?  This leads her back to a horrible World War II tragedy when she learns the family who owned it then were Jewish and had been taken prisoner by the Nazi's.  The `key' in the book is at the center of that tragedy.  The more Julia digs the more she begins to understand her family's involvement in what happened.  She almost doesn't want to know the truth but bravely keeps digging anyway.  There's a very satisfying ending (though to be honest, right at the end, it was almost ruined but they made it work).  The people and their situations and emotions ring true without being overdone.<br /><br />The overall theme of the movie seems to be that no one, on any side of the Atlantic, was blameless in this war.  Looking away in order to save yourself and your property implicates you.....it's just a matter of degree and that gray area is where this movie plays out.  Kristin Scott Thomas was superb in this movie as was Frederic Pierrot who played her father-in-law though he has much less screen time.  The cinematographers, set designers and wardrobe did a great job at evoking believable settings.  Be aware that large parts of the French scenes are subtitled.  Thankfully the subtitles are easy to read.  I hope you enjoy \\"Sarah's Key\\" as much as I did.
B0063IH60K|4.0|game is simple, fun and addictive.  works very nice on the Fire.  gameplay is simple and intuitive.  only get ads as. before starting each game.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I can't get enough of this book. Brilliantly written, and it gives you no idea of what's going to happen in the next book (a good thing, because then it would be boring). I would recommend this book to anybody.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|I turned off the fade in on the alarm, it's too quiet on the Kindle Fire. Even with all the volume jacked up...I finally put some loud tones in that worked well on my phone which I had ripped and edited myself for maximum volume and it wouldn't exactly wake you up out of a coma. Still, it has a nice timer too, same problem, couldn't get much volume but works with my own alert tone. Glad to have it now that I can hear it. Good free app.
0393338827|3.0|The story of an alternate universe...  \\"The Big Short\\" has been on my `Vacation Reading' list since I saw Michael Lewis on \\"The Daily Show\\".  Lewis does a superb job of weaving the characters and events of the 2008-2009 financial meltdown into a very readable story.  Lewis is a gifted writer and he draws you in from page one.  That said I have to fault Lewis for presenting the main characters of the book as if they were David taking on the Wall Street Goliaths.  David had a moral compass.  I think that Lewis' Wall Street background predisposed him to being sympathetic with his `good guys'.  As he moves his characters along the timeline he takes the reader along as almost a co-conspirator trying to bring the reader to empathize and cheer for the very smart if somewhat eccentric `good guys'.  I believe that these people were just as dysfunctional and amoral as the guys on the other side of their bets.    In my opinion, these people fully understood the macroeconomic effect of what they were doing.  They understood that the government agencies responsible for policing the financial industry were asleep at the wheel.  Instead of working to correct this, they provided the means to extend the game in order to gain more and more unnecessary wealth (how many billions does one need to be happy?) at the expense of most of the rest of America.  Generations of Americans will suffer for this activity and these guys will probably never assume any responsibility for the pain to which they have contributed.  They could have tried, as Markopolos did, to raise red flags and warn the rest of the country that the financial markets were rigged to fail.  They could have tried to bring the madness to an end sooner, but instead they were hoping that it would go unnoticed for as long as possible so that they would benefit as much as possible.  I was left thinking that none of these people understood the idea of community service or would volunteer to help anyone, but themselves.    Lewis' writing style deserves five stars, but his thesis, \\"These guys are really cool, look what they were able to figure out while the `experts' were looking the other way!\\" deserves one star.  I read this book and then Markopolos' book , \\"No One Would Listen\\".  The characters in Lewis' book left me cold, but Harry Markopolos: he is a role model.
0439023513|2.0|The momentum from the first book propelled me through the two sequels, but it was overall disappointing.  The relationships didn't feel real, and many of the scenes felt forced (Finnick dying, the whole city scene).  And ultimately fruitless...
0307891372|5.0|This book is a god send.  I would recommend that any Skyrim owner buy it. It offers guides for all the faction side quests as well as the main quest lines
0439023521|5.0|Great storytelling.  Very 1984-ish.  Loved the char. development, the poignancy.  Unfortunately suffers some from the environment, where the characters never really achieve redeeming relationships... This didn't bother me too much in this book, but as the series goes on it REALLY drove me nuts.<br /><br />This book def. comes back to me from time, and I picture or have conversations with favorite characters from the book (like Cinna)  There's so much hate, and so much opportunity for a secret love to be shown.  Her indecision kills me, but I guess it's also where a bulk of the power in this piece lies.

Will wait to reorder these Sector Cds till they get all the flawed inventory out of warehouses.My guess is they dont dump all cds even though they know that some are flawed.They will clear inventory out and let the broken ones come back as returns.Most profitable ( non customer friendly lol)way for them to go about it.  Also I noticed( as some other reviewere pointed out) that all the worlds a stage cd cover holder is somehow folded wrong and flawed.Looks like its tri fold( all other cds are bifold)doesnt quite get it done.
B004RSCWZ2|5.0|The much awaited Tedeschi Trucks collaboration that was worth waiting for.  So many great tracks.  Tedeschi's voice is showcased in Midnight in Harlem.  These Walls brings in a world fusion element that was both surprising and extremely well done when compared to other recent fusion attempts.  A must have CD for Tedeschi and Trucks fans alike.
B0063GORYU|5.0|always loved spider and this fits my HTC EVO really well! lots of options and smooth operation, would recommend if you like solitare
B0063IH60K|5.0|After disappointing game play with other solitaire games available from Amazon I gave this on a try. This is by far the best yet. Excellent game play on the Fire with large card faces, smooth play and great graphics. Only down side is pitch for other games between hands but easy to live with.
B001NEK2GE|5.0|I agree with all the positive reviews.  This is a great device for gaming. I got this instead of the Razer Naga specifically because of the joystick.  It takes a bit of getting used to but its definitely worth it.  However, as mentioned in other reviews, the joysticks ergo is not the best.  It's throw is a bit too far and its design could be better.  However, there is an easy way to remedy the some of that.  I had some little rubber feet (little circular rubber nubs with sticky bottoms) that I had from some other purchase (don't remember what).  I just used a scrapper to give the rubber a little more surface texture and stuck it to the top of the joystick.  It makes moving the joystick a lot easier and more confortable because your thumb sticks to the joystick better and is softer than the hard plastic of the stick.  I'm sure you can find similar rubber feet at a hardware store or even an arts and craft shop.
B002UZ5CHO|5.0|Really makes you think about how harmful convenience is. It also opens your eyes to the crazy that goes on in the world!
B001EBWITA|4.0|It's a bit choppy, uneven, but overall it was entertaining. (If I want to be educated, I'll watch a documentary.) I would have preferred 31/2 stars, but can't do it on Amazon. Tilda Swinton is always good, and is good here, if underutilized. Rachel Whatever was overpaid if she made more than $1, the supporting cast was fun, Lucifer is not to be missed.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|My guess is that most people who do not like this book either are myopically dedicated to a JFK Conspiracy theory OR are not fans of Stephen King books.  Certainly Mr. King's conclusion that there is a very high probability that Oswald was a \\"lone nut\\" is reflected in the plot, but it is simply a framework for a novel that is really about time travel.  The key conversation \\"proving\\" there was no conspiracy is even admitted to have only occurred in the author's imagination.  And just remember -- the novel is about time travel, so you can't really put too much credence in any of the \\"historical facts\\" presented.  Heck, even King's wife believes in a JFK conspiracy as he states in the afterword.  As a student of the assassination (and like King, a believer that Oswald definitively killed JFK and almost certainly acted alone), I liked the references to people, places and events from that time.  But no advance knowledge of the JFK murder is really required to enjoy the book -- the protagonist doesn't seem to know much about the assassination or the people involved himself.  For me, the real beauty of the book is an examination of the late 50s and early 60s from the perspective of someone who is living in 2011 and vice versa.  Plus the whole past is obdurate and harmonization themes (even to King's other books) make for pure entertainment.  This is a long book, but well worth your time.  Only minor complaints were two football-related goofs that would have caused problems for a real time traveler:  The Dallas Texans did not become the Dallas Cowbows but instead became the Kansas City Chiefs.  The Cowboys were in the NFL from 1960 on and the Texans were in the AFL from 1960-1962 and won the championship game in 1962 before leaving for KC.  And the Chicago Bears won the NFL title in 1963 -- the NFC did not even exist until 1970 after the AFL-NFL merger was completed.

B0061US58C|3.0|As a movie, you watch Cars 2 because you have young kids and they love it.  I read a review that put it best: \\"Perhaps Pixar simply got tired of turning out one masterpiece after another and decided to glide\\".    In terms of video quality, the HD is very good. The fact that this is all CGI lends itself better to streaming.    My main complaint, and this isn't limited to this movie, is that streaming HD is NOT 5.1 with six channels of audio. This was full PCM that I let my analog Dolby Surround unit distribute. For a movie like this, that's more annoying if only because the web page states that the movie has 5.1 (no such claim is made, wisely, on the connected device when you go to rent).  I wish Amazon would stop making the 5.1 claim on its other content since I have yet to find any that has a digital audio stream.
0307891372|5.0|Its a game guide. Expectations are hard to exceed, however, this game guide exceeded mines. I usually don't buy game guides, because in my opinion they cost too much, most of the info can be found free online, and im pretty good at video games anyways. Skyrim, however, was a game that i knew i had to get a guide for. I haven't played any of the TES games, so i knew nothing about Bethesda's games. That was one of my reasons for purchasing this guide. Also, many dungeons are confusing and you can get lost easily. Another reason to get this guide, is that it provides detailed information on every quest, location, and place. It also provides detail on every item, ingredient, spell, and how to get them.   If you look at the picture, it looks like this guide is about half a foot long, and pretty thin. Don't judge a book by its cover. This book is very large, and very thick. It has more than 600 pages! The book also comes with a big foldout map that is detailed, showing all holds, cities, dragon mounds, roads, and landmarks. I highly recommend this guide to anyone whose never played a Bethesda game before, and even people who have played previous TES games will still find this guide helpful.
B004FOA84A|4.0|Overall, this played very well on my Toshiba Thrive and had excellent graphics and game play. The only downside is it really is pretty short and lacks a huge story line. I hope to see more like this.

B004A8ZWVK|5.0|I thought that this movie was very interesting, and was surprisingly true to the novel.  Purchasing the HD version provided excellent quality.
B002SF9YNO|5.0|Incredible movie.  Poignant and humourous at the same time, lovingly portrays caring for the dead.  I would recommend this movie without reservation.
B002ZG977Y|5.0|I don't know where the bad reviews came from. This movie was awesome! Fight scenes and special effects are great. Loved the story, the action, etc. Would def watch it again. I saw it on cable so it wasnt all 3d but still had great effects. Def recommend. The only gripe I have, is that is exactly like the God Of War game. I was hoping the rumors of a God of War movie were true, but after a movie like this, I dont see it happening. It would be the exact same movie as that one.
B005EVVESM|5.0|This cd is excellent! I was wary when I purchased it, but after I listened to the whole cd I was so happy! I liked every song except maybe one or two that were 'okay'. I definitely suggest that if you like Maroon 5, this is a must have; you won't be disappointed! Awesome songs!!
0439023513|1.0|This book left me feeling empty, depressed and thoroughly unsatisfied. I would not recommend reading this and wish I had stopped at book 2. The book felt rushed and is written without as much thought as the first 2.  *Spoilers ahead* There are so many unnecessary parts (killing off Prim, innocent children and most of the 451 crew), so many questions unanswered (why did Katniss pick Peeta, what happened to the other victors and what became of Panem after Snow died) and so many parts that are totally farfetched (pods releasing toxic chemicals and creatures that somehow did not affect the rest of the Capital?). Hopefully an alternate ending is made when or if the 3rd movie comes out.

0553381709|2.0|If you read the first and last chapters of each character of this book, you'll know enough without having to dredge through tedium and dreadful chauvinism.  Some give credit to his knowledge of middle ages, but I only see a lack of the sociological history.  And his treatment of women...I don't see much insight into women at all.  It's exhausted me to the point of not caring to finish the series.
B005K17RU0|2.0|This is a nice app but it needs screen rotation to work well on the Kindle Fire. I keep the plug end at the top or side. This app currently does not rotate to accommodate different screen orientations.

B001LMU182|5.0|First, I just want to say everyone's reviews helped me a lot, so THANKS! I've been wanting Akira on dvd for awhile now. I had it on vhs and just never got around to the dvd. Anyway, the week of Thanksgiving I decided I was gonna get the blu-ray. I saw that it only had 4 stars and wondered why, so I read the comments. I'm glad I did! People were complaining about how the dialogue and voices were changed from the original dubbed release. I decided to do some research to see if you could even buy a version with the original dialogue and voice actors for the dub. Surprisingly enough my Google search took me to wikipedia! lol.<br /><br />From Wikipedia \\"Akira\\" entry:<br /><br />\\"Madman [Entertainment] has recently released a DVD/Blu-Ray combo which license is separate from the standalone Blu-Ray release because instead of the DVD version being the Manga Video UK version, it uses Madman/Manga's 2001 Special Edition DVD release which is licensed from Manga UK. The Australian Madman/Manga combo is the only Akira release in print that includes the original Streamline dub.\\"<br /><br />I was ecstatic! So I went to Madman Entertainment's website to buy it and couldn't find it anywhere on their page! I then thought that some jerk put in false information on Wikipedia because, of course, that never happens. *smirk* From there I decided to search their forum page and score! I found a thread about how people couldn't find the blu-ray/dvd combo on the Madman site, etc. A Madman rep responded that it was an exclusive that they created for a store called JB Hi-Fi (it's kinda like Best Buy, I guess) and someone else provided a link to said combo. I ordered it! It came in the mail yesterday and it's awesome! The blu-ray is wonderfully done, so crisp and clean, but it's the dvd that has the original dub. Also, it comes in a limited edition steel case cover. I would recommend spending the few extra buck for this. About $44 after shipping fees.<br /><br />Here's the link: [...]<br /><br />Special Features:<br /><br />DVD: Million Dollar Restoration Includes New Film Interpositive, HD-5<br />High-Definition Mastering With Digital Restoration, THX Certification,<br />Re-Mixed Dolby Digital AC3 Surround Sound And Brand New English Dub<br />Akira Production Report<br />Original Japanese and USA Trailers<br />Animated Menu Gallery<br />New AND original version English Dubs<br /><br />BLU-RAY: Fully remastered THX sound in TrueHD 5.1<br />Original theatrical TVC's and trailers<br />Storyboards<br />Color booklet<br /><br />Note: The blu-ray will play on any blu-ray player, but the dvd is Region 4.

B000G75994|5.0|This is a wonderful performance that I very much enjoyed.  However, when you load the 5th disc, tracks 5, 6 & 7 are mislabeled as the Fantasy in C Minor, K. 475.  The tracks actually contain the Piano Sonata #14 in C Minor, K.457.  It is probably the Gracenote Database that is in error as the jacket and program notes have them correctly indicated and I had the same error when I tried a second set that Amazon sent me in place of the first.  I will try to update the Gracenote system via iTunes but so far all I get is a server error when I attempt it.  You can easily correct the problem in iTunes on your computer.
B004RJMUJO|2.0|This game gets old fast. Slicing fruit??! C'mon. Don't waste your money. After ten minutes you'll wish you hadn't bought it.
B000HIVIOW|3.0|It a great, heartwarming DVD, but one would think poor James would have had a name...for his Snowman,<br />as I've only rented the dvd and not bought one from amazon.com was going to, but my grandchildren not<br />quite old enough to understand it yet.
B004SRNH10|4.0|it works fine I'm giving it a review cause it's obvious people didn't review the instructions and warning in the description, I have a lg joints and other phones too test on and like it says it didn't work so don't give bad review cause you don't like too read
B001KX50BK|5.0|Good movie it should be a classic.  What's not to love about a rich man falling for a good bad girl like Julia Roberts.  Hope the Roberts and Richard G.  team up again for another movie.
B006G2124E|5.0|Well since I watch movies for entertainment I thought \\"The Help\\" was a very good movie. I haven't read the book and the only reason I originally went to see the movie was Viola Davis and Sissy Spacek. I like those women as actresses. I wasn't looking for a lesson in race relations I have a life experience of that from living and traveling in America and other places. The actresses in this movie made it good to me. They played their parts very well and to me that's whats movies are about. Good stories and good performances. There are very few movies made now a days that I can watch more than once. I laughed and I have experienced some mean women who even though well educated and supposedly well rounded, who are very bias(racist) and dogmatic when it comes to there views on race relations. It also touched on how mean spirited cliques are. That's why I laughed my heart out at the part about Hilly going to her grave trying to convince everyone the pie story was not true. Though exaggerated in some cases I think the characters reminded me of characters I know or have known in my life. Kudos to the cast, writers and producers.
B000HLDFK4|5.0|As Tim McGraw would say, I liked it I loved it and I would buy more of it.  Great movie. I admire Sandra Bullock.
B003TJR2HS|5.0|I've had an iPhone for more than two years now and can't believe it took me that long to discover this product. It is so nice to be able to dock my phone while keeping it in its OtterBox case. I am super klutzy and drop my phone pretty frequently, so it's key to keep the case on at all times. Plus, the OtterBox cases are a pain to take on and off. This is the perfect solution!
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Simply put, this app does what you want it to. easy to use, no complications and even the ads aren't obtrusive.   Basically, have wifi, have weather.
B0040YFR1Y|4.0|Predators takes the franchise back to its roots in style.  This movie is what \\"Predator 2\\" should have been.  If you enjoyed the first film and lost faith in the franchise after those terrible AVP films.  Give \\"Predators\\" a try.  This film is a good solid sequel in the spirit of the original yet it takes us into some new territory at the same time.
B005V1WZ10|5.0|There's a lot to be said about a band's continuing ability to risk changing their style, yet keep the same positive reaction in the listener's ears.  For me, Korn's newest gives me the same great feeling as their previous stuff when I crank it past the point of damaging my hearing.  It's a weird therapy for me, but whenever something really pisses me off, I can rely on really, really loud Korn.
0307949486|5.0|This book does have flaws. The plot is strange and meandering: it doesn't follow the usual formula at all. Nor are the characters the usual types you run across in thrillers. The pacing is sloooow at times and you feel (a bit too much in parts) as if the author was concerned with other things besides writing a bestseller. But I loved Lisbeth Salander. Not exactly sure why, but she is the reason I read all three books in the trilogy within a couple of weeks. The final book was a bit of a disappointment, but the first is the best of the three.
B002GYS1FO|2.0|The best song by The Heavy is \\"How Do You Like Me Now?\\" which contain a sample of a \\"Let A Woman Be A Woman\\" by Roy Head. Even though \\"Let A Woman Be A Woman\\" is a James Brown rip-off, that song alone is ten times funkier than this whole album. Roy Head's album Same People (1970), which \\"Let A Woman Be A Woman\\" comes from, is an excellent example of blue-eyed soul. The entire Same People album is on the digital download album called Driving Wheel.  Check out the original stuff before getting all excited by a \\"new\\" group.  [DW]
0307474712|5.0|Did I mention that I LOVED this book?  I read about 100 or more books a year, and my biggest objection to so many of them is that most of the main characters are just too, too perfect.  Emma and Dexter both have just enough flaws that you not only engage with them, but root for them as well -- even when you're not liking them too much.  For anyone who has gone through those 20 (or more) years after college, this story of dreams and goals and disappointments and loves and losses and successes and failures and highs and lows and struggles and denials and overindulgences, and growing up, and growing young is immensely believable and touching.  If you think it starts off a bit slow, stick with it.  You will definitely be rewarded.  And, by the way, I really did love this book.  My favorite of the year so far (and the year is almost over).  I wish I could give it a gagillion stars.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|I loved this book, i have everyone one of Nicholas Sparks' books and i think this is one of his best!
B004AKCME8|4.0|It doesn't follow the books, or so my daughter says. I've never read the books and am only judging the movie apart from the books. The movie is amazing to watch. The computer animation is so real, beautiful and at times disturbing. This movie is not just for kids. But, the battle scenes aren't for the young kids. My 11 and 12 year olds watch this. I wouldn't recommend going too much younger unless they're really desensitized to violence already, which isn't recommended because we should protect the minds of the very young so that they're not exposed to ideas that they're not ready to handle. While there was no blood or gore, there are slashing enemies throats, birds falling hard on the ground, one bird falls in the fire and stuff like that. It's done tastefully, but just be warned. War is violent, and it is not sugar coated very much. Evil birds try to take over and their idea is that the strong rule the weak. The theme of the movie is fight evil, mend the broken and strengthen the weak. Overall, a great moral story with fantastic visuals and interesting characters. I'm very impressed.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book.  It kept my attention the entire time. I read it in two days (which meant I didn't do much else but read) but it was totally worth it.  Two thumbs up, can't wait to read the next one!
B004YEZBW0|3.0|My 10 year old son is reading the books.  Our deal is that he can watch easch movie version after he finishes each book.  Thus far (he is currently in the middle of #4), he has liked each movie but agrees with me that the books are far better than the movies.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was so great.  It was suspensful and exciting, with a little bit of romance. If I could sum it up in a few words I would say.. it is a heart renching 'gladiator' game, that challenges your ethics and morals all the while giving you a taste of pure romance-- the type of romance you dream of as a girl. I could not put this down.  My husband said I was like a zombie.
B003NFM3JU|5.0|disney slam dunked this one.....best 3D effects i have seen....movie itself was great also, must have for your 3d collection!!

B004WGGQPQ|5.0|Very cool little app and well worth the two bucks. (full disclosure - I got my copy free from one of Ammy's daily appstore giveaways) Very handy for keeping a child quiet while waiting at the doctor's office or other situation where something to distract and occupy the little darling is required.<br /><br />Nice selection of basic drawing tools - pencils, brushes, crayons.  Tapping the tool brings up a scrolling color palette with a surprising large choice of shades.<br /><br />Yes, it's more of a toy than a useful tool, but whaddaya want for two bucks?  Adobe Illustrator?
0061997811|3.0|I love this book, I just have a few complaints.  First, it was in bad condition. But I could take that, since it got shipped from the US.   Second, it was missing a lot of things inside. I don't know if that was just me, or if it's like that for everyone? The Marauders map, something that was supposed to be on the Yule ball page and the proclamation stuff was gone. There were just empty flaps.   Yet, it was not used and there was plastic around the book. Has this happened to anyone else?
B005HSG3TC|2.0|If I hadn't had this for a couple of weeks I would have returned it.  Honestly, I waited so long to get the Fire that it was more of a hassle to return it.  The biggest challenge with this cover is that it doens't stay propped up like it should.  Either the grove on the back isn't deep enough or the cover isn't firm enough to keep it in place.  Very annoying.  Other wise it is just okay.
B004QPOVE6|5.0|I've been an AC/DC fan for years, and this is by far their best concert blu-ray DVD ever done.<br /><br />Angus, Brian, and the others are in great form, delivering a superb concert to the huge crowd with lots of energy and style... These guys are high-octane rock at it's very best.  Personally I like the active/dynamic camera work, the dp and video editing is great for capturing the energy of the crowd as well as the performance by the entire band.<br /><br />AC/DC sounds better than ever in this one, and the video capture is crystal clear and looks great on blu-ray.  The crowd's energy adds a lot, and their enthusiasm about being part of rock history is great to watch, as is the band.  This one's a winner, one of my favorite new concert DVDs ever - highly recommended.  These guys show how it's done, they're the 'real thing' and capture the spirit and style of genuine rock & roll.<br /><br />Their new songs they perform fit in great with classics like Thunderstruck, Shoot to Thrill, TNT, and Back in Black -- it's all good.  It's great to see a world-class show... thanks guys for rocking it hard, and to the fans.<br /><br />-ken
B004LZRSBY|5.0|Excellent image, sound great, pity that was the last show.  A trip back to the past, songs of high level.  I recommend.

B003XU02QG|3.0|Modern conspiracy theories are common these days, but they've been with us forever, as evidenced by theories about missing Ninth Legion of the Roman Empire. Centurion explains what happened to the Ninth from the point of view of someone who was there.<br /><br />Our hero, Centurion Quintus Dias (Michael Fassbender) becomes part of the Ninth's destiny when Picts overrun his garrison. He escapes, only to discover that Roman governor of Brittania, Julius Agricola (Paul Freeman), has committed the general of the Ninth Legion, Titus Flavius Virilus (Dominic West) to eradicate the Pict threat.  Their secret weapon is Etain (Olga Kurylenko), a mute Bringantian scout.  With his inside knowledge, it's not long before Dias acts as Virilus' right hand man against the Picts. SPOILTURION: If you know your Roman history, you know this isn't going to end well.<br /><br />Legendary Roman discipline fails in the face of the devious Picts and a surprise betrayal leaves just a handful of men alive.  When they discover Virilus has been captured deep in enemy territory, Dias and his ragtag band form a desperate rescue mission. Along the way the men bond and betray one another, as each falls to privation and violence.<br /><br />This is a gritty movie with few likable characters.  Children, prisoners, and even cooks are murdered as a matter of expedience. The main antagonist has no speaking parts, which makes for an unusual villain.  Most of the movie takes place in the sweeping countryside, a character unto itself.<br /><br />Centurion is more interested in legend than fact.  The Picts are a conglomeration of everything Romans ever reported about them - women warriors, lime in the hair, blue battle paint and all.  This at least makes them more interesting than the typical dirty barbarian types that usually act as villains in films of this sort.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Centurion's plot is as serpentine as a Roman column.  There are long stretches of countryside views that, while beautiful, begin to drag. The audio is muffled - I'm starting to think is a problem endemic to outdoor war films, because King Arthur had the same problem. When Dias finally decides to stand and fight, it's an exciting battle...and then the film limps along to resolve two other major plot points.  The script could have used more polishing.<br /><br />What it lacks in plot, Centurion tries to make up with gore. This is a crazy-violent movie, with more gore than most horror films.  One of the first battle scenes has so many limbs chopped off, heads sawed in half, and gurgling throat cuts that it really detracted from the movie as a whole.  The bloody effects -- an artifact of the movie 300, which seems to have made every producer assume they can get away with CGI blood - look cartoony.  At one point, a guy's head explodes when he runs into a tree.<br /><br />All this adds up to an ambitious but uneven movie.  Centurion tries many different things and only succeeds at half of them.  But the half it succeeds at makes for a decent film.'m starting to think is a problem endemic to outdoor war films, because King Arthur had the same problem.

B004EPZ06Q|3.0|Todd Phillips' 2009 comic masterpiece, \\"The Hangover,\\" resurrected the raunchy comedy with its brilliantly demented \\"lost weekend\\" in Vegas. Despite the top-notch work of the ensemble cast, Zach Galifianakis stole the show more completely than any actor since we walked away from \\"High Fidelity\\" raving about Jack Black.   Even before the release of \\"The Hangover,\\" which made a bazillion dollars at the box office, a sequel was in the works. The great news is that almost the entire gang is back from Vegas and now heads to Bangkok in the sequel, \\"The Hangover Part II.\\" Doug (Justin Bartha) is comfortably married and Stu (Ed Helms) is taking the plunge with Lauren (Jamie Chung), whose family still lives in Thailand. Stu wants nothing more than a quiet wedding, and he wisely spends his bachelor party at brunch. Unfortunately, Stu brings Alan (Galifianakis) along for the wedding, against his better instincts. With Alan in tow, one should expect accidental mayhem to follow, and it does.   In spades.   Once again the boys find themselves awakening with blinding hangovers, blank memories, and a missing friend. Once again, they spend the movie resurrecting what went on the night before, and each discovered secret is more deranged than the one before. Dead bodies. Severed fingers. Toking monkeys. Enraged Buddhist monks. The list goes on and on, and the laughs do indeed pile up.   And yet, one cannot escape the fact that the entire movie is a slightly less funny retread of the original. From the narrative structure (both films start with a phone call to a distressed significant other) to the craziness to the jokes, we've heard this song before. Despite the great comic performances -- Galifianakis alone is worth the rental fee -- and clever use of the Bangkok reputation for depravity, the latest \\"Hangover\\" is as original and inspiring as its title.   Here's hoping that the upcoming \\"Hangover Part III\\" takes the boys on an entirely new journey to the wild side.  Review originallypublished on MyDVDInsider.com.

B005N1OUSE|3.0|A lot of people really like this book for its practical, down-to-earth application of basic marketing principals.  I needed this for a marketing course, and it just didn't teach me anything.  While Roam keeps saying that anyone can right up quick, brilliant ideas at cocktail hour, his documentation on methodology leads me to believe he's had a drink of his own cool-aid.  This didn't teach any concrete way to take the basics of a company or item or whatever and find a clever and unusal but effective way to make that idea animated for the viewer, but it was full of anticdotes about how the author had come up with great ideas on the fly.  I didn't learn anything from this book except that Dan Roam is a marketing genious.  Too bad that doesn't seem to rub off on the reader.
B002ZG976U|1.0|Was NOT a fan of this movie at all.  The plot line was barely lukewarm and the acting was *almost* believable.  What normal girl would shack up with a guy that she has known for two days?  Neither my husband or I were a big fan of this, and would get our money back if we could.  Couldn't even stand to finish the darn thing, mind you!
B004Y1USV2|5.0|Okay, so I've been a Yes fan for about 40 years now.  I'm old.  I get it.  But these guys just keep amazing me!  This is a great album of great songs in true Yes style.  I've met the guys in the band and am so pleased they are still experiencing such success.  They really deserve it.  They're great guys.  I miss Jon Anderson, but Benoit is so good on this album, that rather than being sad that Jon is gone, I'm glad that Benoit is here.  When I complemented his voice recently, he replied \\"it's all about the music\\", and he's so right.  What a great talented bunch of musicians.  I recommend this album to everyone, it's a great listen.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|Got to second set of levels and it didn't save that progress.  Besides it not saving the game plays great on Kindle Fire.
B005CW5E3E|5.0|Finally!!!  Finally a fantastic release by an overlooked guitar great!!!  Some of his recent releases gave the impression he was past his prime and then this.  Arthritis may have slowed him a bit but it is more than made up here in soul and talent!!!  This one has been long awaited and way overdue.  Johnny is keeping some good company on this release too.  Best tracks IMO, either Maybellene with Vince Gill, Bright Lights, Big City with Susan Tedeschi, or Come Back Baby with John Medeski.  I've been a Johnny Winter fan since 1971 and this is a top notch release.  If you have too, check it out, you won't be sorry.
0440242401|5.0|Sophie Kinsella is quite the genius. Remember Me? has succeeded at making me even a bigger fan of hers. I think it would be hard to ever top the brilliance of the Shopaholic books, which I adore, but Remember Me? takes a good stab at it. I'm only sorry I didn't manage to get my hands on this book sooner but I'm also sorry that it's finished because I did not want it to end.   Remember Me? contains all the ridiculous, cute and expected humour that I'm used to from Sophie Kinsella yet manages to be a completely unique story. I really grew to like Lexi Smart as a character and felt well connected to her by the end of the book. Her characterization is very realistic and I really felt like I knew her as a person. I wasn't too sold on her for the first 20 pages or so but then it really picked up pace and I literally could not put the book down. I was so drawn into Lexi's world and I just had to know what on earth was going to happen next!   I felt so impatient throughout this whole book but not in a bad way. I was just excited and captivated. I was completely intrigued and dying to know how everything would work out for Lexi. Every interaction with the minor characters held my interest and I seriously enjoyed getting to know Jon- and Eric, actually! I loved how we were given just enough detail to keep us guessing but we weren't told everything right up front. I found my mind working very fast to figure out who was good and who was bad. Just as I'd have it figured out, Kinsella would hit me with another shock!   Remember Me? was just plain fun. I love Kinsella's books because she creates a whole world that I can get lost in. I could not handle setting this book down for one minute and was so sad when it was all over. I loved this book and can't wait to see what else Kinsella can give us.
B004ZQRFGM|5.0|Vocals are outstanding and the guitar is even better.  This is a must have CD if you like guitar blues.  She plays with the best of them.  Among others you can hear definite SRV influences especially in the latter parts of songs like the title track Unconditional.  Stand out songs are Fearless Blues, Count Me In, Unconditional, Your Love Ain't Real, Voodoo Woman, and Soulful Dress.  Best IMO is either Count Me In,  Soulful Dress, or Unconditional.  Not one disappointment.  Fantastic tone with real soul in the playing.  If you were only going to buy 1 new CD you couldn't go wrong with this.  If you like SRV, Buddy Guy, Sass Jordan, Susan Tedeski etc. check it out, you'll be glad you did!  Highest Recommendation!!!!
B003NFM3JK|1.0|Poor Charles must be spinning in his grave. With all due respect to the other reviewers who thought this was faithful to the original story, what Christmas Carol did you read?! I don't recall Ebenezer surfing a rooftop on an icicle or rocketing into the stratosphere after snuffing out Christmas past in the Dickens classic.  This is a prime example of a movie made solely to showcase 3D. Zemeckis has proven with Polar Express that he can make a great movie where the special effects are embellishments to a good story line. Not here. Lest you forget, nearly every scene is designed around showing off just how cool 3D can be, whether it's Marley spitting or an insect sized Scrooge rocketing down a drain pipe (I'm sorry, what page is that on in the book?)   If you want a 3D thrill-ride, where Tiny Tim takes a backseat to the special effects, you'll love this. If you want a heart warming version of a classic tale - Alistair Sims version remains the gold standard.
159562015X|4.0|1. You can use the codes only once.<br />2. I used this book twice in a year (in the beginning and then after 8 months), and the results were somewhat different, so be prepared to buy this book every once in a while to \\"re-assess\\" your strengths<br />3. Many managers tend to use this book to set up teams - this book does not provide an objective assessment of ones true innate strengths, but it offers a glimpse of the test-taker's strength at a given point in time. So managers and leaders, please afford your team members to retain their individuality and do not label them based on this book.

B004EPZ06G|1.0|This movie is so bad that I am actually upset with myself for wasting the money on it. I bought both of the Hangover movies anticipating an enjoyable back to back escape from reality after having surgery and taking my pain meds. While the first one barely passed for humor, this movie actually had very little to do with humor and IMHO the actors should have refused to do the material as it is so stupid. I didn't laugh during the film and I was under medication. The acting/actors in this film are the worst and I'm pretty sure they will not be seen again for even going along with this plot. If you think you want to waste the time to watch either of the Hangover movies wait for a few weeks as these things will be selling for $1.00 in the bargain bins.
B005F3XV62|1.0|There were some big names in this movie and it had such great potential but it was a big let down. They took it way too far in terms of animal and human interaction. I mean, bringing a guerrilla to TGIF and he ends up dancing with a girl and the girl whispers \\"I'm so glad I met you!\\" Come on!  Definitely some funny parts, but overall I would pass on it. I don't know that it would even appeal to the younger crowd. I think Dr. Doolittle was better in terms of the storyline mixing animals and people.
0395389496|5.0|Gift for my grandchild that I was taking on the Polar Express ride.....always a great story for young or old.
B005HI4LMS|4.0|I'm not going to build this up because that's the worst thing you can do for a comedy. It is a comedy. It is hilarious. And it was my saving grace from all the drama's at Sundance. I love it.
B006J38144|5.0|This does not disappoint,the characters all \\"do their thing\\" and I love Tara as the torn and tortured, but loyal wife.
0698116496|5.0|Our son loves this book!  There are so many ways you can read through the book to get a lot of mileage out of it.  Early on we just focused on what the animal names were but as our son progressed we got in to things like finding the balloon and moon on each page or what sounds the animals make or the pictures of the zoo keeper and his wife on the wall.  Sometimes we find ourselves reading this one multiple times a night.  I picked up the full sized board version of the book.  It is nice and big and fun to have your kid turn the pages while he sits in your lap.  I've seen the smaller version and would recommend that, unless you need one for easy travel, buy the full sized version.
0300169787|5.0|I don't know what else to say!  I only got to see two shows of McQueen's, but they made a lasting impact on me... I was so excited and happy and pleased to get this book, and after only a few pages in, I was crying at the imagery!  Honest-to-god tears!  McQueen was a beautiful soul, and getting to see his work in such detailed close-up is breathtaking.  Even putting aside the fact that we will never see what he could have done next, this book is wonderfully laid out and really gives a close inspection of what McQueen's work was and where it came from.  My only regret: I just wish they had some kind of CD with videos of the runway shows... what I'd give to see this art in motion!
B0031RAOVY|5.0|What better to look at than Richard Gere and beautiful dogs?  Makes me happy although it is sad at the end.  Parts of story might be contrived, but without knowing all of the true history, can't tell.  Frankly, I just fast forward through anything but Richard Gere and/or the dogs.  I turn on the subtitles so I don't even have to listen to dialogue (which I found VERY hard to hear anyway) and watch all the beauty.
0882709194|1.0|If indeed their is a hell, Ray Comfort will be among Satan's favorite few. I love life, food, sex, astronomy, and compassion. It's a shame people like Mr. Comfort (and those alike) will never fully understand even the smallest range of these beautiful human (Homo sapien in particular)emotions or interests.
B004LOMB2Q|1.0|I can't figure out what amazing things this is supposed to do -- take notes? I also tried to save a webpage using it.,b ut it only saved the URL. And I can't access it without  wifi access or paying apremium price.  I also can't get rid of the \\"shortcut\\" for it on my Kindle Fire after uninstalling the program.
B002RSQGQK|2.0|OK..Alfred Htchcock is a great director but if he makes this movie...Sorry ..I am not seeing any of his movies.  storyline is neither romantic nor a thriller. The killer is pretty obvious and in the end so much for the thrill, his intentions nor the plot are even mentioned once. Damn ....what a waste.
B0000E1WKE|5.0|If you like Whitney Houston, you will love this CD, it's very energetic and fun.  The last song is great.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I got this as a library book for my kindle. Science Fiction or futuristic books are usually not what I read.  But I got caught up in the story immediately, and downloaded after I read the sample.  I didn't realize it was a series, so when I got to the end I was surprised and a bit disappointed. I doubt I would have gotten it had I known it was to be continued.  However, I bought the second book and am well into that now. It's very visual, and I can actually see a lot of the characters and creatures in my mind's eye, even when not reading, especially the muttants, unfortunately.:)  Stays with a person. Very absorbing book.
0670022411|5.0|This has to be one of the best books I have read, I love the author's ability to build the relationship between the characters and the readers. I have read \\"A Discovery of Witches\\" twice now and every time I do I love it more and more. I am greatly anticipating the release of a sequel, really hope it's soon
B000002952|3.0|The music was very good and had a friend to tell me the words on a train back from Florida.
061891868X|4.0|Lee's book is all about envy. Envy related to his own point of view. Lee is a professional physicist and I can't blame him, revealing his emotions when it comes to string theory. It seems all true- a competition leading only to the Hall Of Fame. I liked his ideas. I love lee's way of grasping the Universe's sicrets through the realm of plain visualization. It is a breath taking testimony of our enigmatic nature, written by a man who kept his way in a humble and discreet way, analizing and rethinking again till his intelectual spirit flies free. The book is a masterpiece deserves a five stars rating but who gets it all?
B004T6IBNY|3.0|I really love Pinball games, so I downloaded this one after reading several reviews of how great it was. I was disappointed and glad I didn't pay for it. The graphics were great and it fit the fires screen perfectly- which is the only reason I gave it 3 stars. On the Kindle Fire it wouldn't always register my touch.  I know that part of this is the Fire's fault, but this game was worse than others. I was constantly losing balls because it wouldn't pick me up- or it would but it would be too late.  I got frustrated and uninstalled it.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I mourned when this triology came to an end! By far the best books I have read in some time.
B004MNVKVO|5.0|A disc set that is produced beautifully!  Disc 2 has 3 videos with a fantastic remaster of their audio and the HD DTS is a fantastic for a surround of an originally produced in stereo that really does it justice.
0307888681|4.0|I enjoyed World War Z--particularly how all phases of the zombie breakout were covered and the fact that it was covered from a global perspective. While I love that it's a collection of short stories--making it an oral history--this also took a little away from the enjoyment. Because it is a history, though a fairly recent one, there is much less urgency and tension. The fact that you don't stay with any one narrator or story for long also takes away from the impact--at least it did for me. While each story is fascinating... I missed attaching to a character and the tension that builds with a continuous story. That said, it's still a great read. Brooks took a unique and very thorough look at this subject. And heck. Zombies are fascinating!
B004EPYZT4|3.0|I liked this new Conan movie for several reasons. The special effects were good and the casting, acting, costumes and story line was OK, but not great! It was bloody and had a lot of swordplay in it. I liked Ron Perlman as Conan's father, (is Ron in every movie I see anymore)? But something was missing?<br /><br />Here it comes; I liked the old version better with Arnold Schwarzenegger and James Earl Jones. Yeah the special effects were not as good and Arnold's kind of a cheesy actor but it was just better. I can still see a young Conan pushing the giant grain mill stone with dozens of other older men and 20 years later he was pushing it by himself and the man ready to become the warrior. Jason Momoa tried his best but he is just not Arnold. Maybe I was younger and more impressionable when I watched Conan the first time. I am spoiled by all of the great special effects in today's movies and so I was looking for something special after waiting for 29 years for the remake. I watched it in 2D and it just was missing the BANG I expected to see.<br /><br />The remake is worth watching but don't expect any revelations in the story line or to be knocked dead. It was just OK and let it go at that.
B001EO2UJK|5.0|Luxury package, astonishing sound quality both in stereo and DTS 5.1. It is like you go through the most famous and amazing Genesis albums for the first time! You discover new sounds n ever heard before, vocal timbers, tones and atmospheres are totally new! Loads of bonuses, even the dvd audio 5.1  tracks are supported by amazing images leading you through the album atmosphere. And more...interviews, live shows and concerts...Must-have!
0060558121|2.0|The premise of this book has been done before.  It's a good premise but Gaiman drew the story out too much.  The beginning kept me interested, but it got real dull and boring.  At times, I kept wondering when things were going to happen.  I know it's an epic story and I should sit back and just enjoy the writing, but I started not caring.  The final 50 pages of the book finally picked up, but I had to trudge through 500 pages to get there.<br /><br />I actually liked some of the side stories more than the main story.<br /><br />First Gaiman book and I don't know if I want to read another if this book is indicative of his other books.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Love all three books. A must read for anyone looking for a book that has it all! I cant recommend it enough
B000GG4Y32|5.0|The kind of film that has sadly just about disappeared - the personal,<br />auteur driven epic.  Very rarely if ever now will a studio give a film<br />maker huge funds to do a risky, personal, not obviously commercial<br />project,  one that could never be made as a `small' film.<br /><br />While critics can nit pick, and a few of their points may be valid (both<br />Beatty and Diane Keaton were at least 10 years older then their real life characters,<br />making some behavior seem overly naive and juvenile instead of understandable<br />for their youth and inexperience), overall this is a masterful combining of the big picture<br />and the personal, and how the two interrelate in life.  How do we deal with emotions that<br />are much messier than our ideals of how to live?<br /><br />It explores the twin faces of revolution - the sometimes desperate need to fight to<br />create a new order, but the danger that the new order may be just as corrupt as the old.<br /><br />Rare is the film that deeply, honestly explores both idealism and the dark realities of<br />political compromise.  Rarer still is the film that explores both in a personal way, without<br />judgment, but with deep insight.<br /><br />Beautifully shot by Vitorio Storraro, wonderful production design.<br /><br />Keaton and Beatty are very good in the leads, and the supporting cast, down to the<br />smallest role, is generally magnificent.  Especially amazing are Maureen Stapleton<br />as Emma Goldman, and Jack Nicholson in one of his very best (and most restrained)<br />performances as Eugene O'Neil.  He may capture the true pain of trying to live through<br />the eyes of an artist as well as anyone I've ever seen.<br /><br />The Blu-ray is particularly beautiful.<br /><br />Thrilling, challenging, gorgeous, emotional and epic.  They don't make 'em<br />like this anymore, and that's our loss.
B003ZSJ212|3.0|I was very eager and excited to purchase this set of \\"STAR WARS:THE COMPLETE SAGA\\" on BLU-RAY,I had even sold my regular DVD SET from 2004 for these.I placed my order early on February 3,2011 in great anticipation  of receiving the BLU-RAY release from 20Th Century-Fox Home Entertainment and Lucasfilm Ltd.I finally received the set in September 2011,but to my surprize and horror,Disc #2-\\"Attack Of The Clones\\" had 2 defect/glitches in it in two differant places during the movie!The first defect happens during the night scene when Anakin frees his mother from the Tuskin Raiders that have kidnapped her,and the second defect happens during the scene where Yoda gets off the transport ship during the battle on Geonosis.I double-checked these scenes to be sure it was not something else,but they were and are genuine defects made during the duplication and or the mastering process at some point,just who is at fault I do not know,but someone is.Amazon sent me 2 sets,and both had the same defects on Disc#2.I also contacted Fox about it,they sent me a replacement for Disc#2 with the same exact defects!I am pleased over-all with Discs#1,#3,#4,#5,#6,#7,#8,and#9,but my problem has not yet been teken care of.Fox and Amazon said they would replace the defective set,or the defective disc,when the set was re-done and re-mastered,but months have passed,and the set has NOT been pulled off Amazon until new sets come in,and Amazon and Fox have yet to contact me,I am still waiting for positive results from them,so let this be a WARNING to all fans and to video collectors too....!

B002ZG98Z0|2.0|I kept hearing bad things about this movie and that is what kept me from seeing it for so long. I was at a Blockbuster kiosk the other day and it was only $1 so I decided to rent it. After all, I loved the series and the first movie. I should have listened to everyone I talked to about this movie.<br /><br />IT WAS HORRIBLE! So bad. Oh, man was it bad. The only thing I found funny was when Charlotte said something about not wanting to lose the nanny.<br /><br />The movie went by so slow and I was thinking \\"when will this be over!?\\" throughout most of the movie.<br /><br />Too many bad puns. Jokes fell flat. And I didn't really like any of them. They weren't themselves. I'm just going to act like this movie never existed.

B004WPYO4C|5.0|My first contact with Mike Leigh's film Naked came with a series of soundbites that DJ's at the University of Maryland's college radio station had sampled and turned into station ID's. These included several monologues by David Thewlis' frustrated and angry protagonist, Johnny, including his rants about the coming apocalypse. This prompted me to seek Naked out on VHS, and I was both troubled and fascinated by Leigh's film.<br /><br />Nearly twenty years later, Criterion has released naked on Blu-Ray, for the first time giving me the chance to see the film as it was intended. I'm struck by the composition and stark cinematography -- both of which hold up remarkably well, whereas many other films from the 1990's do not. And although the film documents a very specific time at the turn of the century in economically-depressed post-Thatcher England, it is still very relavent today.<br /><br />Naked centers around Johnny, a young man from Manchester fleeing the repercussions of an act of brutality that occurs within seconds of the film's opening. He arrives in London, where he calls on his ex-girlfriend and her flatmate, developing a physical relationship with one as he longs for a romantic relationship with the other.<br /><br />We then follow Johnny through the next forty-eight hours of his life, drifting through nighttime London and disrupting the lives of the various people he encounters until he inevitably returns to his ex-girlfriend's flat. Johnny's odyssey is at once satirical, tragic and so unflinchingly brutal that it becomes difficult to watch.<br /><br />There is also a parallel storyline involving the owner of the flat, an affluent sociopath named Jeremy who is perhaps one step away from American Psycho's Patrick Bateman. Both Johnny and Jeremy are brutal to the women they meet, but are fundamentally different. Although the consequences of their behavior on the women they encounter is the same, their motivations are diametrically opposed. Without Jeremy, it would be impossible for the audience to have any compassion for Johnny.<br /><br />Much has been made of Naked's misogyny, but I think it's important to understand the distinction between documenting misogyny and condoning it. Naked doesn't justify such behavior, but lays it bare for the audience to see. It may not be pleasant, but it's a part of human life that should be examined and discussed.<br /><br />The film is in the middle in terms of getting the \\"Criterion treatment\\" -- besides offering up a solid HD transfer, it includes an interview with American director Neil Labute (In the Company of Men) about the film, who has also been charged with misogyny for his own cinematic studies of the dark side of masculinity, a thirty minute interview with Leigh recorded for the BBC, a commentary track featuring the director and some of the actors, and the original theatrical trailer (which makes Naked look like a relationship comedy). The extras all help to enlighten Leigh's motivations for making the film, but lack the \\"film school in a box\\" quality of other Criterion releases.<br /><br />If you're coming to Naked as a fan of Leigh's other films, particularly those centered around family dynamics, I think you should be aware that this film is very different from his other work. It dispenses with his usual ensembles and almost solely focuses on a single character. However, if you're interesting into delving into the psyche of one angry and embittered young man and seeing how he effects the people around him, then Naked is definitely worth your time.ave any compassion for Johnny.

B001GQSY64|5.0|I was very impressed by the BLU-RAY quality of this well made computer animated movie,the transfer is perfect,the video and audio quality is first-rate all the way,and there are plenty of extra bonus features too,a very highly recommended BLU-RAY release!
0142404071|4.0|Just to get this out of the way, I'm a huge fan of anything that has to do with Frankenstein.  Whether it's the novel, memorbilia, the movies, hell, I even own some of the \\"Remco\\" & \\"Sideshow Toy\\" stuff.  With that said,  I enjoyed this despite the simplicity of the interpretation.<br /><br />Granted, I'm very aware that the novel is difficult to adapt properly, as well as it is to make it so younger readers can enjoy, but Gary Reed did an admirable job here.  However, what I really liked was Frazer Irving's interpretation of the monster.  Outside of Berni Wrightson's version, I felt this was spot on.<br /><br />I know nothing's perfect; this version left out some things (like the burning down of the DeLacey cottage) and some of the artwork is a tad too cartoonish (and in some cases just plain odd), but the cavils are minor.  The thing that really impressed me was the cinematic framing of some of the panels.  Some of the drawings had the compositional creativity of the storyboards of a Scorsese or a Peter Jackson picture.<br /><br />Highly recommended for the Frankenstein buff or a younger reader who wants to tackle a dark Gothic operatic tragedy in a version that would be a little easier to understand.  Well, that's my two cents.  Cheers!
B00127RAJY|5.0|I bought this, because I'm a new mom and need a workout that is short (I do it after my baby goes to bed).  I love it! I used to run (and still do, just not as often) and would have hour plus workouts pre-baby, but I just don't have the time anymore. This seems to be just fine in keeping up my fitness and toning without taking forever. Level 1 is moderate for me, but 2 and 3 are tough! I definitely love this DVD.
0061537969|5.0|This is one of the best books I've ever read. It teaches that the canine mind is not just another skull covered with fur.  If we pay attention we can discover  their unique powers and learn that compassion is not only a human trait  You never look at your dog the same way again. It's the kind of book that I will read over and over again.
1594744769|2.0|I bought a hard copy of this book because it had some cool photos. The first two-thirds of the book were good and then it turned out to be not good at all. I was hoping to find something not so fantasy and it felt like there wasn't anything new. I think this book is for younger readers, probably ages 12-14 who haven't read as much as I have.
1451627289|2.0|I love most of SK's books but was very disappointed in this one.  The beginning started out interesting but by mid-book was pretty boring.  It certainly was not terrifying (as was indicated).  If you're looking for a 'typical' King book, this is not it :(
B006C45MRE|5.0|Ignore the movie snobs.  This was a very enjoyable movie with fun characters and great effects.  Just because the plot is simple doesn't make it less enjoyable. (Look at Star Wars, simple plot but one of the biggest films ever made)  For anyone who has an open mind and loves sci-fi...this is a MUST SEE.
B005URRCUY|4.0|Their are quickly turning into two types of keys fans,Pre and post danger mouse fans, are you a thickfreakness/rubberfactory or attack and release/brothers fan. This new album El camino cements danger mouses influence with high production and backup singers etc. This is not in any way a bad record,it has great energy,power and the keys have never sounded tighter as far as playing and vocals.  You just have to ask yourself, how light do you want your black keys ?  If you came in with the danger mouse records you'll have no problems,if your a fan of the original sound of the black keys i suggest you do some pre listening before you buy this album. Once again I state this is in no way a bad album,its fantastic,but how you like your keys is gonna determine how much you dig this record.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This is one of those cases \\"why didn't someone think of this sooner\\"<br /><br />Whenever I see someone enabling notes or e-mail via portable device I mention Evernote for recommendation (no i don't get paid for it) it just makes the day easier, what technology was invented for

B0064X7FVE|1.0|Looking at the Android permissions required for this app, I am very reluctant to install it. I can see why it wants to know where you are, so it can give local weather (Good luck with GPS on the Kindle Fire - I guess the WiFi locator might find you within a zip code).  I can see why it wants to look at calendar and contacts to see where you plan to be.  But why does this thing need to send SMS messages (good luck with that on the Kindle Fire - no 3G) and make phone calls without letting the user know about them (Good luck with that on the Kindle Fire - no 3G)?    It's this sort of thing that makes me think it's rigged to make calls to the author's expensive 900 numbers or premium SMS numbers.  No, I don't have any evidence this app is malware or thiefware, but am having a hard time figuring out an innocent explanation for why it needs those permissions.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Great app, great graphics and radar is seamless. This is the best one for Kindle by far! Continues to be my favorite weather app!!
B005V4FJC4|1.0|I didn't buy this album. I listened to it on a streaming service first. I'm glad I did that, because this is just awful. Have you ever been to a coffee shop where the owner's tone deaf live-in girlfriend (and part time inept barista) forces the owner to host open mics so she can subject the patrons to her \\"talent\\" until she drives all the customers away and the place goes out of business? That's what this album is like.
B004R36QUE|4.0|Going into King's Speech, I was expecting one of two things. Either it would be a ridiculously boring film about snooty royalty giving speeches and doing snooty royalty stuff, or, as I had heard from many others who had seen it, it could be an emotional personal piece that everyone can relate to and enjoy. It ended up being the latter of course, and this worked both to its advantage and disadvantage.  The cinematography was beautiful (if not a little to \\"showey\\"), the characters were relatable, and the acting was superb. Rush is the shining star of all this, as it is he who the audience connects most with and it is he who is the most fun to watch.  Saying all that, the mass appeal of the film does make it hard to enjoy at times. Too many scenes showed the king stuttering as either the characters we are meant to like look down in pain or the characters we are meant to hate smirk. At the same time, there is very little moral ambiguity to any of the main characters. Rush hates cigarets, cause their bad. The king and all his allies hate the nazi's, because they are bad. Making fun of stuttering is bad. Stuttering is sad. I'm not saying I disagree with these things, just that I can easily see the film makers hands at work when they use these conventions to get the audience behind or against certain characters. At the same time, this film is based on history, so I expect there to be bad sides to all the real life characters (No, I don't consider the five seconds of kingly snottiness to be a bad side). Finally, there are more then a few \\"cutesy\\" moments that got on my nerves. By this, I mean moments like when the queen sits on the kings stomach and remarks something to the effect of \\"I quite enjoy this\\". Blah. Probably just my personal taste, but those were annoying.  Still, the film could've been a few hours of boring droning, and it does take place during a very interesting time with interesting characters and themes, so it's still a good film. Just not a great one.
B005ZTFPFQ|3.0|It does have a list of old school atari games (only 3 that I heard of the 15+), but those are not included, only able to purchase from this app via amazon. I do like how the controls can be adjusted for your own liking as per the touchscreen user. I do not like how the screen wont orient.
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|Unable to download free angry birds.  Keeps telling me I have to pay for a free item.  What is up with that?
B004EPYZPS|3.0|I thought Dakota Fanning was to be in this movie. Maybe I am thinking of another movie. While it had a lot of action, it was kind of boring to me. I think teens or 24 year olds will like this, I didn't.[[ASIN:B004EPYZPS Super 8]]
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I never heard about The Hunger Games until I saw a trailer for the movie coming out next year.  I downloaded the books and had them read in less than a week and a half!  The story is easy reading and gripping to say the least.  I tried to put the books down on several occassions when turning into bed.  After laying there tossing and turning, I'd get back up to read more.  They are difficult to put down and can actually get your pulse elevated at times.  It's a good read and I am passing them on to my 11yr old daughter, whom enjoys them as well!
B004YKB52O|5.0|This is definitely one of my favorite albums of 2011. The album is fun and energetic. But there are still some slower songs such as \\"Gone Too Soon\\" and \\"Astronaut.\\" I'll be honest and say I hadn't listened to Simple Plan in years, but this album made me fall in love with their music all over again. Get Your Heart On! is full of great collaborations including Alex Gaskarth from All Time Low, Rivers Cuomo, Natasha Bedingfield, and K'naan.   One of my favorite things about Simple Plan is how much they care about their fans. Once again, they show how much their fans mean to them with the song \\"This Song Saved My Life.\\" Not only was the song written with the help form the fans through Twitter, but the band even had fans come into the studio and sing on the track.   Although I do love their other records, I believe Get Your Heart On! is Simple Plan's best record yet. It was definitely worth every cent and I highly recommend this album to anyone.
0439023513|2.0|Miserable ending. Detail would have been appreciated on how her relationship developed with Peeta, you can't help but become emotionally invested in her characters and its simply disappointing to not have a full ending.
B005OCFHHK|2.0|The UK box set is available on Amazon.co.uk for ~48 bucks (30 GBP)...and it has all 8 movies + 3 bonus discs...dont buy this one...its a ripoff...Also the UK version is Region Free Bluray. So works out to about 6 bucks a movie...thats cheaper than any other deal out there, especially for such high quality Bluray discs.

B000VYX8PE|5.0|ILove this book i read it in my language arts class and we all loved it. it was kind of funny,[ not the part where the parents unfortunately died or when Count Olaf slapped Klaus ] but really an awesome book
B005Z271Y6|3.0|I agree with everything said. I should of gotten the DVD version instead, it's probably better! In the last quarter of the concert, the angles of the camera get better and improved from previous shots. I own a 47\\" LCD 1080p TV with a Sony Ps3 playing the show and the concert image quality is bad, especially when they show the audience shots. I'm also not a fan of widescreen Concerts ( meaning it shows a black line at the bottom and top of the screen, does not fill the screen). Alot of angles are out of focus as well. YOu will see for youself if you decide to purchase this...  As far as the show itself, it's a great concert with Adele's amazing voice being the highlight. She does not need smoke, dancers, or the need to be showing SKIN to put on a great show. And the bad language she uses should of been kept to a minimum.    If you want to see an amazing BLU RAY concert check out- Michael Jackson's this is it or Celine Dion through the eyes of the world or Thalia en primera Fila :)
B005O64VH8|2.0|Each song of this album is somewhat like the re-creation of some old songs from their past albums. From the first piece to the last, if you have listened to their past ones, you will immediately get a feeling like this part is evolved from this song or that song. I can't agree with some of the reviews here noting that this is addition to the white stone. Actually it has no similarities to that album, instead quite a few melodies were inherited from the last album, earth songs. Rolf is definitely running out of his inspiration, and deeply trapped into his own past composition and formulas, that's why this group has gradually added vocals to their old songs to make money. If you never heard their past albums before, you might find this one is good and haunting. But if you compare it to their past classic ones, this one only deserves one-time listening, and 2 stars is the best rating I could give.
B0000DJE9R|5.0|Fast shipment, I listened (rocked out) to this right away.  Great quality I didn't expect anything less so no complaints

B005F6NA56|5.0|The drumming is poor overall and a deeper male voice would improve the girls' chorus on a few songs, and \\"the Circle Married the Line\\" and \\"Bittersweet Melodies\\" at times feel like the same tune, but this is still an inspired work of real beauty, a true masterpiece.  Unlike St. Vincent or Lisa Hannigan in their new albums, as a singer-songwriter Leslie Feist in \\"Metals\\" takes chances and aspires to advance her work to a higher level of greatness.  Her voice is an amazing instrument; it communicates such authenticity and depth of soul in a heartfelt, adventurous, and original way.  I often wonder how she makes those sounds--and how she even thought to make them.  There is genius there.  Tender, powerful, clever, passionate, Feist stands alone above her contemporaries.  Buy this album.
B002QE3CTY|4.0|this is a suspenseful book with twists all through out the book i was alway reading it in all my free time on the edge of my seat. this book is worth reading
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I love how I can make notes on several different devices and be synced on all of them. a must have for anybody.
1451627289|4.0|11.22.63 is a nice thick book, just like King used to produce in the 80s/90s when he was he was well and truly becoming the most famous author of modern times, always thought of when someone uttered the words - I'm looking for a good horror novel, and kids who didn't even read novels, knew his name (and even pretended they read his books by referencing the poor quality straight to video movies that came out at the time when his books came up in conversation).  The thing that made King's books work back then wasn't the actual supernatural creatures, forces or horror scenes, (and for the record 11.22.63 actually isn't a horror novel, more of a sci-fi tale).  What made the great King novels like It and Christine such masterpieces was that he took you into each narrators' mind, and made you feel you were there in whatever era in the past each novel was based in.  That's exactly the case again with Jake Epping who is shown a doorway by his friend that takes him back to 1958.<br /><br />At 740 pages it's great value for money in these days where authors seem to have a word count limit of not much more than 200 words forced on them by publishers.  In fact if this wasn't written by a huge name like King, I think editors would have either separated it into a series of books or just edited out a lot of the side stories.  But I'm glad those side stories weren't given the chop though as I quite enjoyed especially revisiting Derry, and the reference to my favourite King novel It. The Jodie chapters were pleasant reading too, sure the novel would have worked without either of these two journeys, but I'm glad they were there. I must admit I was a little bit bored with the Oswald research years section of the book, I don't know if that was just because we'd already spent so long with the other stories and I was getting a little bit over it and wanting to get to main action or if those chapters just wasn't that interesting.<br /><br />Like any good novel it raises discussion questions such as what would you do if you had this opportunity.  Although granted this isn't a new question, usually it's a certain German (well technically Austrian) man with a moustache that is the one you're asked if you could go back in time and were given the opportunity would you kill them?  In fact the book isn't entirely an original idea, the time travel mechanism is the same as used in a novel Die Damulstur by Akif Pirinicci, which you're more likely to have experienced as the movie version [[ASIN:B003ZXNCHW The Door]]. You can throw in a bit of Groundhog Day, plus the whole profiting from knowing sporting results was obviously made famous by Biff using Marty's Sports Almanac in Back to the Future II.<br /><br />Still original idea or not, King's made it work well when he asks the question, if you could go back and stop JFK's assassination, would you? More importantly should you?would you do if you had this opportunity.

B0064NTZJO|5.0|Ryan Gosling's unnamed hero in DRIVE doesn't speak much. With toothpick in mouth, leather gloves on hands, and a satin jacket emblazoned with a scorpion on back, the Driver lays the stakes down to a client in the opening scene of the film: \\"I don't carry a gun. I drive.\\" Five minutes is all it takes, he says. Gosling's character then winds through the city streets in a Chevy Impala evading police cars and helicopters until he deposits his passengers in a crowded stadium and walks out without breaking a sweat. And ... cue the candy-colored opening credits set to Kavinsky's \\"Nightcall.\\"<br /><br />Nicolas Winding Refn's latest may be minimalist in design, but every shot, every line uttered, every emotion is deliberate. In fact, there's very little dialogue in the film. (Refn's explained in interviews how he and Gosling stripped some lines from Hossein Amini's script to add mystery to the characters.) Gosling's Driver is an alien peculiarity. Stuntman and mechanic by day, getaway-hire by night, his coolness is almost Zen-like. (The \\"My hands are dirty\\" line from the trailer does a sufficient job highlighting the Driver's aloofness.)<br /><br />Drive bears all the marks of a gritty noir story, from a heist gone wrong to a menacing mob boss played brilliantly by Albert Brooks, but it's the tragic romance between the Driver and girl-next-door Irene (a pixie-haired Carey Mulligan) that provides the backbone to the film. Most of the interaction between the two is framed in lengthy, awkward pauses and longing stares. These are two individuals who are emotionally immature and border on adolescent despite being in their mid-to-late 20's, finally commiserating their damaged relationship with a slow-motion kiss set in an elevator. (Favorite film scene of 2011? Yes.)<br /><br />Mind you, this happens before Gosling's character bashes a mobster's head in with his boot until it falls apart like a pumpkin. Like BRONSON and VALHALLA RISING before it, Refn embraces extreme violence toillustrate how unhinged the Driver becomes to protect the one he loves--and unsettle an audience brought up on revenge exploitation films. Compare DRIVE to the recent tone-deaf remake of STRAW DOGS: Refn understands Sam Peckinpah more than Rod Lurie does.<br /><br />Stylistically, this may be the most \\"eighties-esque\\" film of the year. Set in a nocturnal L.A. devoid of the usual sights and sounds, it's the most dreamlike movie Refn has shot. The synth-like soundtrack by Cliff Martinez harkens back to the days of Tangerine Dream and Vangelis, and Refn digs into throwback bands like College and the Chromatics to pepper some of the slicker scenes of DRIVE. (There's one sequence in particular that wouldn't look too out of place as a deleted scene from Carpenter's HALLOWEEN.) But don't call it an homage--DRIVE is very much a modern film, a tuned-up ride built with craft and care and begging to have its pedals pushed hard.
B00364K6YW|5.0|I just saw this for the first time a couple of weeks ago.  I watched it with my sister, who recommended it.  So there we were, glued to the telly for six hours.  The characters are spiffy and the experience smashing, indeed.  This one goes straight to my top 10.  Absolutely loved it! Bravo!
B005I6EU48|4.0|I have my Kindle Fire & Verso Prologue Cover RED almost one month ago (november 18). Now I have an objective appreciation of them, this review is about the cover.  (I also have a Kindle Fire review : 3 stars)  Pro  It is really nice, cute, lovely antique book good looking; friends have almost unanimously like it huge (oK, some have asked me if I am reading my Bible... jejeje, doesn't bother me because yes, sometimes I read the Bible, actually I already downloaded (free)[[ASIN:B001EOCFU4 The Holy Bible, English Standard Version]].  This cover truly resembles an antique book cover. In the front cover it has a low relief figure that is great. I will rate it as superb: 5 stars.    RED color is more burgundy than red, and it is absolutely beautiful.   Inside slim pocket: Nice feature that you will effectively use for carrying a microfiber cleaning cloth ([[ASIN:B004G64X02 Carson Optical super-soft microfiber lens cloth for all Lenses and Eye Glasses]]) because the KF screen is very sensible to fingerprints (almost a nightmare).  Microfiber interior is fine for protecting the screen, altough it take dust easily.  Corner Elastic Straps: Length fit properly and with high tension (vigorously) SO it is designed to keep the Kindle Fire all the time with the cover on. Don't buy it if you like to take off the cover frequently.   Fits properly after a \\"break in\\" period: Be patience, give the cover a couple of weeks and you will love the way it works.  Con  Prologue requires a \\"break in\\" period: Yes, initially front cover doesn't close properly, but after 2-3 weeks the cover fits great over the kindle.   Pricey: Not real leather altough it is really \\"leather alike\\" (\\"animal friendly\\"). I think it price should be around $25 - $28... and I would give 5 stars. Paying $39.99 for a $199 device .... Uhmmm, that is 20% of the KF price ...  Upper Elastic straps pass over the speakers, but I think Kindle Fire is not for \\"high volume\\" use. Usually I am wearing my [[ASIN:B001V9LPT4 Klipsch IMAGE S4 In-Ear Enhanced Bass Noise-Isolating Headphones (Black)]]. I like a lot the elastic straps (very secure) so I forgive this because it is a design issue.  Some of the nice figure painting over the cover probably won't last over time.  I would like a mechanism that holds the case closed.  The case doesn't have a stand up mechanism.  oK, sometimes we wan't every single feature we like .... Sometimes it is not relevant, but we bought the [[ASIN:B004R7A9NU CaseCrown Apple iPad 2 Bold Standby case for iPad 2 (Black)]], ¡ $25 !!, for the iPad2 and it has a back stand that I miss it in my KF cover.  Pictures posted at Amazon are exactly as the cover.

B0030IIZ4M|5.0|This is a great movie to have in your collection. The storyline is wonderful, and the choices of actors to voice the characters are perfect! Great for all ages.
B001993Y3G|2.0|I love the original movie. I dont care about the accent complaint or the inaccuracy.  I Hate this copy of the movie. What bothers me is this blu ray includes the extended version only. The extended version of a movie is not always the best as demonstrated by this blu-ray. I'll explain why. In this extended version the scribe character gets his tongue cut out. Later on in the extended cut you see him using chalk and slate to write messages to the sheriff rather than talking (cause he has no tongue you know.)  But later in the movie in a scene that was in both versions of the film he is talking as if he still had a tongue when Robin asks him where Marian is.  Maybe I'm getting nit-picky but it just really bothers me that they not only would not attempt to fix such a blatant error but also make this the only version available.  Its like the Director could care less.<br /><br />also theres a hole bunch of extra devil worship crap and a annoying sub plot they added that makes the movie even darker.<br />I actually found and watch the horrible DVD version instead. Because even though you have to flip the disk half way through the movie, at least it is the original theatrical cut.

B004SBQAN8|2.0|As I am sure with many reviewers of movies whom have read the book - I was hoping for more along that story line contained in the pages.  The video just didn't drag me in the way the book was able too. Not enough backdrop and the life the \\"aliens\\" had left behind to completely gring the viewer into the picture of just why they were there and what the reasons for same were. The acting is acceptable more focused for the teenage crowd.  I felt that with a little more aged theme the movie could have come across much better. Have read the sequel \\"The Power of Six\\" and enjoyed it as much as the first - but will not be waiting with baited breathed if a movie sequel is made.
B001AQR3JY|5.0|Great movie,makes a great gift. My daughter loved this movie so much she asked for it as a Christmas gift. I also love the movie and am glad it came out in December.
B005IZLPME|4.0|For a Marvel action hero film it was very good, particularly in 3D. 3D does add a dimension to any movie as far as I am concerned (pun intended) that does add to the movie viewing experience. I like 3D movies better at home than I do in the theater except for IMAX viewing, which I find phenomenal. With IMAX you feel like you are right there in the moment.
B004L3AR0K|5.0|Great movie! I honestly thought I would HATE it but ... surprise ... I loved it! Very well done. The love story is honest, heartfelt, and very human. This movie has comedy, romance, and the story keeps you interested. The characters are well portrayed and the emotions are meaningful. The most meaningful thing in the movie is the love story, which tells the tale of two people who struggle to come to accept the fact they're strongly in love with each other. Their story is fantastic! It makes for a great movie! I look forward to watching this many times!
B005VR9328|5.0|Wow! My anticipation for this album was extremely high and I can't say I was disappointed. This album is proof as to just how influential & innovative The Roots can be. They continue to push the boundaries of Hip Hop into something indescribable unless you listen to their music.<br /><br />It starts off with a pitch, just a pitch, which leads to a bit of instrumentation which leads to a heartbeat. And this sets the tone for the entire album. From that moment you know that what you are going to experience is going to be phenomenal.<br /><br />For me this album was amazing after the first listen. Which I can't say the same for \\"How I Got Over\\", which dropped last year. For some reason it didn't click with me right away, but I love it now. Weird. *shrugs* Anyway you'll hear a lot of talk about this being a concept album, and unless you read that it's about a fictional character \\"Redford Stephens\\" then you really would be oblivious as to how. But after I read that I kind of understood it. The themes could be placed into the life of a single person, any person really, so I get it.<br /><br />From start to finish you have these beautiful compositions from The Roots crew. Each song is beautiful and unique in it's own way. And while I'm on this topic I want to touch base on something. I absolutely love that with each album The Roots manage to keep their own diverse sound, but at the same time they are able to make each album sound so unique and different their previous work.<br /><br />Lyrically Black Thought is amazing. He continues to show why he deserves that place in my top ten list. Sad to say many people sleep on him. You always get the same generic top ten list wit 2Pac & The Notorious B.I.G. at the top. And then they throw in some other MC's to please the majority. I've never seen Black Thought in any famous MC's top ten. But I won't get into that right now.<br /><br />Honestly the only fault I have with this album is it's length. It runs at just under 39 min (approximately 38 min 50 seconds). And the last four songs are one minute instrumental pieces. Which all flow together so well that on my first listen I really thought it was all one track until it ended. So I really don't know why they didn't piece it all into one track.<br /><br />Standout Songs: \\"Lighthouse (Feat. Dice Raw)\\" & \\"I Remember\\"<br /><br />Honestly though there's only 9 songs that have lyrics accompanying them so it's kind of hard to chose. But \\"Lighthouse\\" is definitely my favorite off the album. Dice Raw does his thing on that song.<br /><br />Overall Score: 9.5/10 - This album is a beautiful masterpiece from start to finish. I just feel like the length of the album kind of brings it down. And splitting the last four songs up was really unnecessary. Looking at the track list and seeing 14 tracks only to be caught off guard that four of those are barely over a minute, and one doesn't even reach that. But despite that I still highly recommend you check this out.

0893860220|5.0|mind boggling book - only had my copy for a few months and i've already given away 4 copies to friends... the question and answer format is perfect for just picking it up, opening it to any page and letting it tell you what you need to know at that moment - kinda like the I Ching or Tao Te Ching... some of the questions were absurdly idiotic, but Nisargadatta patiently answers them with simple metaphors that even a child might understand - unfortunately i think few of the questioners did... not quite ready yet...  the only thing i can really criticize is he repeatedly refers to God / Supreme in the masculine as \\"he\\" / \\"him\\" / \\"his\\" - perpetuating a deeply conditioned infantile patriarchal delusion of a masculine 'God' that even i saw through as a teenager... but of course he was immersed in a deeply imprinted patriarchal culture that sees the feminine as spiritually inferior to the masculine (Buddhist nuns must STILL stand and bow when a monk enters a room they're in) and apparently he never got that inane patriarchal filter cleaned out...  But don't listen to me - listen to him:  -------------------------------  \\"Ultimately nothing is mine or yours - everything is ours.

Then the all becomes the One and the One is yourself - not to be separate from me. Abandon the idea of a separate 'I' and the question of 'whose experience?' will not arise.\\"  \\"You have created the world's sorrows out of your own desires and fears - you deal with them. Having given 'reality' to the picture on the screen, you 'love' its people and suffer for them and seek to save them. It is just not so. You must begin with yourself - there is no other way.\\"  \\"To take appearance for 'reality' is the cause of all calamities. You are the all-pervading, eternal and infinitely creative Awareness - Consciousness. All else is local and temporary [and illusion]. Don't forget what you are.\\"
B000Z8GZYW|5.0|I love Bill Murray because of this movie, and his ability to portray a man who grows through the experiences of life.  The movie is funny, with a good mix of both high-brow and low-brow humor, but it also allows one to enjoy seeing a man who comes to understand that he has a incredible opportunity to learn and grow and to change himself and the world, and when he finally arrives at the pinnacle of selflessness, he is granted the freedom to move forward at last.  It makes me wonder what I would spend time doing if I had the chance to live a day like that?  I don't know if I'd be able to succeed as well as Phil ends up doing on his last Groundhog's Day, but I hope so.
B001F6ZIXC|2.0|I could see you liking this if you're a Harley dirt-bag (real or imagined)for it's over charged machismo that the lowest common denominator tends to worship. The reality is this is a show with poor dialog, mediocre acting and worst of all it glorifies the idiot bully mentality that is at the heart of a cycle \\"gang\\". These guys should be hung from the highest tree for pure a-holeness, not glorified. It's just too hard to like any of these characters, why would you? Would you want any of these morons as a friend or neighbor? I hardly think so. If you like a criminal show, watch a well written well acted series like \\"Breaking Bad\\".
0385344325|4.0|Seemed to me that this was one of Child's better efforts.  The story was especially interesting, as it seeks to tell how Jack Reacher ended his military career and started out as a loner with a toothbrush.  An unusually brutal ending shakes the reader up a bit, but it may have been the only way to solve the problem of \\"who dunnit\\" and will they get off scott free.  .....  Now to pick a nit.  In ch. 57, Jack is walking through a woods on a small path, and he comes on a railroad track.  OK so far.  But he tells us that the railroad track was running from left to right.  ?  A single railroad track?  Running from left to right?  ....  And then, in ch. 73 Jack shows off his knowledge of Martin Luther King who said that \\"...all that was necessary for evil to succeed was for good people to do nothing.\\"  Great quotation, except that it was Edmund Burke who said it, not MLKing, unless he repeated it sometime.  King had problems with plagiarism in his Boston University days, so maybe he didn't attribute it to Burke.  BUT, all that aside, this is a good story, introducing some characters we run into in later Jack Reacher stories.
0307891372|5.0|Worth every penny of the very reasonable $16-something price! It's huge! It has a giant fold out poster map! You really just have to have this if you're playing this game.  The game is so huge and complex that you really kind of need a guide to navigate it. This guide has every instance with maps, and I really love the lists of artifacts/shouts/quest items/spells/books/what-have-you with a check-box column so you can keep track of what you're missing and where you got to go next. There are walk-throughs of all the quests, all the who, where, and whats, with strategy hints. It also warns you of how spoilery the spoiler they are providing is so you can make those choices to your liking. But lets face it, it's a giant compendium of spoilery goodness.   I've played through the main quest line once, now I'm going to play it again with the guide for a series I'm doing on YouTube. It will be interesting to see what I missed.
B004EPYZSK|5.0|It's a great sci fi movie set in the old west. Great cast, some cool action scenes with D Craig givin what's for to some punks... H Ford is an interesting character, as usual... WAAAY better than the last Indy movie. It is believable visually, good support cast... token lovely lady.... some cool plot twists! It's obviously a tongue in cheek flick to some degree, but you would never know it by the acting. They are in the zone. If you liked firefly you should love this idea. The film is fast paced, holds your interest from the get go... anyone who can't enjoy this ride needs a laxative.
1451627289|4.0|Excellent book, but I only have one quibble: Jake Epping/George Amberson is a cipher. He never once mentions his parents, his own childhood, any background information at all. I understand the use of a cipher - It makes sense to allow your own personality and reasons to merge so that you can make your own conclusions about what he is doing.  However.  In a book like this, where motive is everything, I wanted to know more about Jake/George. I wanted to know why he was compelled, other than curiosity, to continue down the road he was on.  That being said, and that being quite a vast problem, I still enjoyed the hell out of it, so that's saying something.

However not all is lost as I can still chart the current position on the chart by just transferring manually the lat and long values.  I think is an amazing little wonder and with an appropriate electronic laptop based charting software can easily replaced the more expensive packages offered for nautical use.

B000JQUKKU|5.0|\\"No space of regret can make amends for one life's opportunity misused\\"<br /><br />Ebenezzer Scrooge is one of the most miserly, greedy, selfish businessmen, especially at Christmas.  Through the visions of his dead partner, Jacob Marley, and three Ghosts, Scrooge is sent on the learning experience of a life.<br /><br />There is a reason why this book is so prevalent in our (Western) culture, how everyone, even those who've never read the novella/book, know the story so well (which is why this review will not have any spoiler notices).  This story is a story that hits us to the core, that forces us to look outside our selfish lives and to think of others.  And while the characters aren't the most nuanced, it is the story, it is the heart of the book that is most important and most inspiring.<br /><br />The characters are rather one-note, if you think about it.  Scrooge is the only one that undergoes any change (somewhat expected, as it is a novel about his growth), but he starts out as the hideously over-done selfish man and ends up as the happiest, most joyful man in the world.  Seeing his drastic change, however, does make the story more compelling, which is probably why Scrooge was painted so over-the-top in the beginning.  From his little sister to Belle to Bob Crachit and his family, the characters tend to be blindly cheerful and happy despite their conditions.  About the only one I can think of off the top of my head that isn't is Mrs. Crachit, who definitely harbors some resentment to Mr. Scrooge.<br /><br />But the remarkable thing about \\"A Christmas Carol\\" isn't the nuanced, varied characters, but the story, the journey, Scrooge's miraculous change.  Reading it for the second time (I read it once in high school on my own), I was still touched and intrigued.  I discovered more of the humor (the bit about Marley being more of \\"gravy than of grave\\"), the deeper meaning of the story.  A lot of times, it seems that movies take the bits about Scrooge celebrating and honoring Christmas, and while that is an important theme, I thought the more important theme was to look out for your neighbor and open your heart.<br /><br />Scrooge was miserly, giving his employee a crappy wage (something like 15 shillings a week!).  He refused to have anything to do with his nephew, he wouldn't give to the poor, and he had no compassion for beggars.  While he lived in a huge home, he only lit a single candle and lived in a single room.  And as the Ghosts reveal his past, present, and future, he slowly realizes, \\"Hey, I should have been nice to that kid on the street\\", \\"Hey, I wish I had agreed to visit my nephew\\", and \\"Hey, I should do something about my employee's work conditions\\".<br /><br />And that is why this book is so great, in my opinion.  Christmas is one day and not everyone celebrates it the same way (or at all!); but kindness and generosity can be expressed ALL YEAR LONG and EVERYONE can share it.  That is how I interpret it when Scrooge says, near the end: \\"I will honor Christmas in my heart and try to keep it all the year\\".  Christmas isn't the Christian holiday, or the commercialized version that we see all around us; Christmas is the compassion we have to those around us.<br /><br />Brought to you by:<br />*C.S.

B00006JKOM|3.0|Jethro Tull was a very adventurous band in the 70s - they could be heavy like Sabbath, folky like Bert Jansch, folk-rocky like Steeleye Span, or proggy like Van Der Graaf Generator.  And they were brilliant at all of this.  On this album, they go for a more mainstream pop/rock sound, almost Elton John-ish.  There's some good moments here - the first two tracks are pretty good, energetic rock with a touch of Tull's distinctive originality.  Salamander is a fine acoustic number, and Taxi Grab is a bluesy rock number.  But, even the good songs here would only be one of the lesser tracks on any other Tull album of the era.  There are a couple down-beat numbers that don't really have the musical interest of 70s Tull, and then there's \\"From A Dead Beat to An Old Greaser\\", which is probably the only Tull song from the 70s I don't actually like.      Overall, a decent album with some pretty good songs on it, but considering Tull released 9 or 10 albums in a decade that were absolute masterpieces, it certainly seems like a mis-step for this era.
0062068423|4.0|In this novel Inspector Harry Hole begins an effort to trace a deadly sniper rifle, which he fears has been imported to Norway for a high profile assasination. His investigation leads him to encounter Norway's wartime past and its contemporary far-right subculture.<br /><br />Many reviewers have compared this work favourably with some of the great contemporary Scandanivan thriller writers like Larsson and Mankell, and, aside from the setting, in their consideration of neo-nazism and social issues there are important common themes. The hopping time lines of this book, from turn of the 21st century Norway to the Eastern Front of the 1940s, also reminded me of Phillip Kerr's recent book \\"Field Grey\\". Both of these books mix serious consideration of some of history's less well remembered episodes into craftily contrived thriller plots.<br /><br />However if that makes it sound too worthy, don't worry. Its a cracking thriller with some shocking twists and some pitch black humour. Great craic!

B00070DK14|4.0|Throughout their career, Tull was constantly trying new sounds/ideas while generally being rooted in a mix of heavy rock and acoustic folk.  The 80s saw them simplifying from their more complex prog-rock musicality of the 70s, with this album being the first one to replace the virtuoso drumming with more simplified, straight-ahead drumming (although Gerry Conway here does some nice percussion at times - but he's not a complex prog drummer like Barry Barlow or \\"A\\"s Mark Craney).  Martin Barre's guitar is kind of metal-tinged through much of this album, but the mix tends to keep it pretty far back (I was hoping the remaster would change this, but it didn't).  There's enough flute, mandolin, acoustic guitar, and acoustic piano to please fans of older Tull, with a bit of 80s synth to modernize the sound.     This is the early-80s favorite of most Tull fans, due to the more synthy/techno departure of the albums before and after it, but I tend to find it less adventurous and energetic than those two (particularly the preceeding \\"A\\", which still had some folky touches and higher level of musicianship combined with its new \\"modern\\" sound).  This album, I find, tends to drift towards a more mainstream rock feel, although with a distinctively Tullish flavor.  There are some decent songs on it (Pussy Willow, Slow Marching Band, Seal Driver), but not up to the par of classic Tull, and there's a concious effort to make the songwriting and musicianship simpler than 70s Tull.      The sessions for this album were the first time Tull took over a year to produce a new album.  It seems this was due to Ian trying to figure out a new direction of the band, as well as recruit new members after the one-off lineup for the previous \\"A\\" (that replaced the long-time lineups of the 70s) disbanded, leaving half a band.  Anyway, there were enough songs for two or three albums recorded in '81 and '82, of which 10 appeared on the original \\"Broadsword and the Beast\\".  A bunch of them popped up on the 20th Anniversary Box Set, which are now included as bonus tracks here.  For the most part, they are at least as good as the album tracks here, while some of them (\\"Mayhem, Maybe\\" and \\"Jack Frost & The Hooded Cros\\") are actually superior, and seem to be a throwback to the classic late 70s Tull sound Ian was trying to get away from.  If you have the box set, you'll have these songs already (although they're remastered here).  There were also quite a few other songs from this era that popped up on the Nightcap set (released in the early 90s) - these songs weren't as good as the ones included on this remaster, but weren't bad - I was kind of hoping they would've been collected here for completeness.      As far as the remaster goes - it is louder, and there's more bassiness (not more bass guitar), but it still seems to suffer from the muddiness and lack of instrumental clarity of the original CD release, in my opinion.  Honestly, it sounds different, but I don't know if it's an improvement.    The liner notes show Ian's current shying away from the prog-rock greatness of Tull (also seen in the notes to \\"A Passion Play\\"), where he admits to being embarassed by having an unfashionably interesting stage show with a giant ship on stage .  It always saddens me to hear great artists who've been fooled by the B.S. pop trends of punks and critics who think that playing bad music and failing to entertain concert goers is somehow a good thing - funny enough, new-waver Adam Ant at the same time was dragging a giant pirate-ship stage around for his shows.  What was it Ian was trying to tell us with \\"To Old To Rock'n'roll, Too Young To Die\\" - oh yeah, \\"don't bother trying to change to keep up with modern fashion trends, as everything comes back around\\".  Too bad he didn't follow his own advice!    In summation:  this is a pretty good album, with more elements of classic Tull than most post-70s Tull, but lacking the overall richness and musical creativity of their classic era.I don't see the remaster as necesary for those who already have the album and 20th Anniversary set, unless you like that loud, bright modern sound (as it doesn't sound clearer to me than the old CD), but if you don't have the box set, it's worth it for almost an album's worth of quality bonus tracks.

0312641893|5.0|I love fairytale retellings, so I was excited to read Cinder, which is a futuristic retelling of Cinderella. Putting ancient fairytales into modern or future settings doesn't always work, but Cinder is one of the best books I've read this year and one of the best fairytale reimaginings I've ever read.   In this version of the tale, Cinder is a teenage mechanic living in the distant future in New Beijing. Because of a childhood accident she doesn't remember, she has some non-human parts. As a cyborg, she's a second-class citizen who is basically the property of her awful stepmother. Just like in the original, Cinder has two stepsisters, but in this version, one of them is actually nice to her. Cinder toils all day at a stall in the market, repairing anything that needs fixing. One day, the crown prince shows up at Cinder's stall and asks her to fix an old android for him. This meeting sets off a series of events that changes Cinder's life forever.  The world that Marissa Meyer's creates is unique and well developed. Asia is united under an empire ruled by the Crown Prince's father. The empire is threatened by a terrible plague, which spreads like wildfire and kills people in a matter of days, and a scary empire on the moon, ruled by the evil Queen Levana. The Lunars, with their ability to influence everyone around them, are really scary, and the Queen is a great villain. The romance between Cinder and the prince is only in the beginning stages, but it's fraught with tension because he doesn't know that Cinder is a cyborg, and she has no idea how he'll react if he finds out.   I loved Cinder as a character. In some versions of the tale, I find Cinderella a little annoying. Often, she's passive and meek and just takes all the misery that's heaped on her without complaint. Cinder isn't at all like that. She's snarky, she has no problem talking back to her evil stepmother, and she's plotting her escape from the drudgery of her life. She's definitely not a doormat.  The book is the first in a series, and I can't wait to see what happens next. The ending isn't really a cliffhanger, but Meyer has taken the story in a really interesting direction. I'll be anxiously awaiting the next book in the series.

B004DLPXAO|1.0|The \\"Privacy Inspector\\" app reports that the Kindle App accesses the following information.    Unique SIM ID  Unique IMSI  Phone Number  Unique Device ID  Perhaps it accesses several different unique codes as a fail-safe for rights management, or perhaps it is to support more devices.  The possibility for tracking, for example for marketing, bothers me a little. The phone number bothers me a lot.  The excuse seems weak, and the risk to privacy seems high, so I am looking into getting my eBooks from somewhere else.

1455816795|5.0|Unlike the BBC production which takes liberties with the original story and a Jim Hawkins who sounds about 25 years old, this production by Colonial Radio is faithful to the story. The music is as usual fantastic, and reminds you of those great swashbuckling adventures from the 40's. The actor playing Jim has great energy and I totally believed I was there with him on this perilous voyage. Long John Silver is great, and the on again / off again friendship, or \\"trust\\" ship with Jim is spot on. The supporting cast is also excellent, and I think this is a magnificent audio production of a great classic.
B000IZ6URY|5.0|There's a reason why this DVD version of \\"Team America: World Police\\" is unrated by the MPAA. If you don't think that a movie where the characters are marionettes can be sexually explicit-really explicit-think again. Having read about the movie, my wife refused to watch it until I had prescreened it and knew where to jump over the most explicit scenes.<br /><br />But I have to say that the movie is laugh-out-loud hysterically funny, from the opening scene where Paris's famous landmarks are demolished, to the finale, where Team America wipes out liberal Hollywood actors like Alec Baldwin, Susan Sarandon, and Tim Robbins, and skewers North Korean maniac leader Kim Jong-il. Oh, and the demise of the overstuffed Michael Moore, that was really satisfying. I think the movie works because it never takes itself seriously, it just rolls along quickly from one absurd scene to the next.<br /><br />The sex scenes were too frequent and too explicit for my tastes, though. Somewhere I read that an R-rated video was also released, and I'm guessing that it would be much less explicit.<br /><br />My bottom line for the movie is this: Would I watch this movie with my mom? And the answer is: Not in a million years!

Great music, excellent acting, a fantastic plotline that keeps you guessing, dark humor...and it's creepy. When I found I could purchase the season here at Amazon I wasted no time in so doing. All of the characters are great, but if Jessica Lange doesn't win an Emmy and a Golden Globe for her role as Constance, somebody's not paying attention. I'm possessed by this show. BEWARE...it's more addictive than any other series I've ever seen.
B0068TJLSY|3.0|I was thrilled by the trailer for this film with the truck racing head-on to derail the US Air Force freight train and the awesome collision that appears to release some creature within one of its cars.  Alas, that amazing footage is nowhere to be found in the film itself.  The film has such a Spielbergian feel to it, it becomes sport to find which camera shot was from E.T. and which one was from Close Encounters of the Third Kind.  JJ Abrams is likely the most talented filmmaker around (LOST, and reboots of Mission: Impossible as well as Star Trek).  The 1979 setting in Ohio provides a great authenticity; you feel you know everything about this town -- and the atmosphere is spot-on.  The acting is terrific as well.  The mysterious premise draws you in as well.    But the film tests your patience midway through.  The film relies substantially on what you don't see off-screen -- think BLAIR WITCH PROJECT kind of off-screen.  After awhile, the creature seems to be just a cousin of that unseen force that terrorized characters on the island in LOST.  It also makes a weird noise like the creature in James Cameron's \\"Aliens.\\".  God, there's several scenes that look like they were digitally \\"borrowed\\" from that film.  And the ending, meant to be as emotionally evocative as a blend of ET and Close Encounters, was oddly unsatisfying.  Yeah, it's digitally spectacular -- how could it not be -- and how those mysterious cubes came into play was a stroke of genius.  Still, the wide-eyed awed expressions of the actors that so many on this comment stream complained about, is tiresome.  Oh, and by the way, the driver of the pick-up truck would be strawberry jelly after the head-on impact with the train.  I'll leave it at that.  JJ, it was a gorgeous film, but it was a bit too much of an homage to 1970s Spielberg.  The creature we're meant to care about was bizarre and menancing.  No wide-eyed E.T., that one.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Stephen King writes about and conveys the emotion of the past better than anyone I have ever read. Once again we get a glimpse of what it was like to be in Maine in 1958. King's readers have been there before but now can see it through the eyes of an outsider. (This sounds more like a tease instead of a review, doesn't it?)<br /><br />King takes the simple premise of going back in time to stop Lee Harvey Oswald from killing President Kennedy and turns it into a deep insight of how the world, indeed, moves on. The main character, Jake Epping, is convinced to go through a time portal to try and stop the assassination but finds that the past does not want to be changed and will create situations to prevent it. It is obdurate. I really enjoyed the brief glimpse into the world of [[ASIN:B002SR2PKG It]] and how Derry, Maine and Dallas, Texas are somewhat interchangeable in the world of our past that King portrays here. Jake Epping has several conflicts to resolve throughout the book such as: can a simple school teacher kill a man in cold blood even if he knows that he may represent evil, and how risky is it to fall in love with someone in your past that want to change anyway?<br /><br />In the end, King gives us plenty to think about and also plenty of suspense as Jake Epping hurls towards his date with history. As another reviewer wrote, the end is bittersweet, but the at the same time leaves us wanting to hear more. This book is not obvious and gives us convincing evidence that Stephen King is the Master of Fiction.

B0002VFXFE|3.0|I have used better over the years so I was extremely surprised by all the recommendations toward this product.<br /><br />1)  What I received in the mail was a single vial of thermal grease, in a syringe.  No instructions, no packaging.  So maybe that was a seller issue but to recive 0 documentation with it was a surprise.<br /><br />2)  On their website, the instructions are very specific on how to apply depending on your cpu.  However, for ridged or non-flat heatsinks, the painfully (no joke, over 12 pages) instructions become plain dumb (involving a credit card, razor and coffee filter).  Look, I get where they were going but they don't have a sperate pdf for non-flat heatsinks if the new instructions boil down to \\"fill the gaps\\".<br /><br />Hopefully the actual product will be stellar over the long run but the everything including the installation has left a lot to be desired.
0439023521|5.0|The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins<br />'''''<br />Every year the Hunger Games are held and it was time for them to begin again. There are twelve districts and each district has to have a boy and a girl between the ages of twelve and eighteen entered into the games. The children are put into an arena and have a fight to the death. There can only be one survivor. The odds were high for Katniss and her friend Gale to get picked because it is done by a lottery system. Once you turn twelve your name went into it once each year and if you needed help with food for survival you could get some by entering your name more times. Katniss and Gale did this a lot. Even though the odds were high for them, Katniss's younger sister Prim who only had her name entered once, got picked. Katniss Volunteered to save her sister and with that decision began the fight for her life.<br /><br />I finally sat down and read this book now that the movie is coming out in March. I had heard great things about it and had it highly recommended to me many times. I was not disappointed. I absolutely loved the story. The adventure was always exciting and I was continually wondering what would happen next, which kept me turning the pages.<br /><br />The characters seemed very real and I found myself cheering for them.  This book had heart also. It wasn't just a cut-throat adventure, there was more to it. There was love, friendship and heart breaking moments. I was not only cheering for the main character Katniss. I wanted her to kick butt and win but I also couldn't help loving some of the other characters (i.e. Rue).  I've been completely drawn into this world and I can't wait to read the rest of the series.<br />It is definitely a bit of a dark book considering twenty four children are having a fight to the death. This is the first time I have read about this kind of thing. I think part of the reason I waited so long to read this book is because of the subject matter. It was a hard thing to wrap my head around.
1451648537|5.0|Steve Jobs was a creative visionary but a very flawed person. I really appreciate the fact that the author didn't shy away from how terribly Jobs has treated some of the most important people in his life. This book is well-researched and well-written. Anyone interested in technology will find this immensely interesting but more importantly anyone interested in human story will find this a insightful study of a person that changed the way we all live.

0545265355|1.0|Let me start by saying that this series is well written and a fast read.  Beyond that, I am utterly shocked that the content has been written for children.  My 7th grade daughter came home months ago, completely obsessed about this series and I looked at many of the reviews on Amazon.  I was not impressed and refused to purchase the books.  She promptly went to the school library and read them anyway.  Then, my 5th grade son came home with a \\"challenge\\" from his teacher to read a certain number of points by the end of the school year.  A list of books were given with points alotted for each; this series ranked with the highest points of anything save Harry Potter.  I was upset at first but then, after reading the author's own interview on the Hunger Games website about the age group this series is meant for, I was furious.  Neither of my children qualify for the age requirement Mrs. Collins recommended yet, this series is being pushed, recommended, praised and given to everyone with no regard for the scars it will leave.  Then the trailers came out.  With my daughter's obsession growing ever larger, I decided I needed to read the books for myself and know fully what I was up against.  I have just spent the last three days reading the entire trilogy and I can honestly say I have never been more disturbed about anything she has read than I am about this series.  Yes, I could go on and on about the horrible things that happen in the books; murdering children, governmental control, starvation, genocide, etc.  There are more than enough reviews giving a great view of what's in store for the reader.  The most disturbing thing to me is that children are finding something familiar in the the main character, Katniss, and want to pretend to be like her.  In my opinion, there is nothing redeeming about this character.  I understand that the society she lives in has drained her of all emotion but the author clearly wants you to believe there is still a sense of right and wrongin her.  If you buy that, then Katniss is the most selfish, unfeeling, callous person I can imagine.  She kills with no remorse, no thought to what she is doing other than how it will help her survive.  These are not qualities I want my children to relish having, much less find familiarity in.  I am disturbed this is a popular series with the young reader population and I am even more disturbed that it is being made into movies; movies that my children will not see but would like to.  What is our world coming to when we are so numb to death and murder that we let our babies see this kind of filth in living color?  My daughter actually thinks the trailers look \\"cool\\"!  There is nothing cool about killing each other for sport.  Make your own decision about reading this book but let me leave you with this:  I recently read an article about a woman in Asia who was mauled by a bear and did not die immediately.  She was able to use her cell phone and call her mother on three separate occasions during the attack and state that the bear was leaving and returning to feed on her.  Imagine how that must have felt to know something is eating you and you can feel it but not do anything about it.  There is an eerily similar scene at the end of the first book.  Imagine your child reading that and getting a visual in their mind.  Those are images you can't unread.  Now, imagine your child seeing that on a big screen in a theater.  Imagine the blood spatter, the moaning of the victim, the hopelessness of the situation, the endless torture of it all as it continues for hours.  This is not meant for children.
B003YVCJQ0|5.0|Its a good movie to sit back and  watch while the world is saved for the American Way!  And they didn't even try a sequel(Yet)

B0013D8LCW|5.0|A love story that just happens to be gay. No tragic AIDS victims, no bashings, no nc-17 rated sex scenes just for the shock value. There are sex and love-making scenes but the camera view stays above the waist. Let's be honest...Trevor Wright and Brad Rowe are easy to look at from any view.<br /><br />A great *feel good* film about NORMAL people, some of them just so happen to be gay. And the gay characters live *happy ever after*.<br /><br />I've rented it so many times that the rental fees would have purchased three or five copies. It is now part of my private library.
B002KS1IJC|5.0|I am a GREAT fan of Jim Caviezel, so I admit to my prejudice in advance.  But he did an excellent job in this movie, as did pretty much everyone in the cast.  As a story and as entertainment, this was a wonderful 2 hours.  As a movie in all its computer-generated glory, this was incredible.  I rented it, and enjoyed it so much I purchased it.<br /><br />Caviezel is from another planet, much advanced over 9th Century Norseland.  His ship crashes on Earth, killing all aboard  except Caviezel and the Beast.  He joins forces with a local tribe and sets about hunting the Beast.  Or is the Beast hunting them?  Along the way, of course, he picks up a woman who is a warrior to match his own heart and skills.<br /><br />The monster is similar in so many ways with all the other outer space monsters, but with a few twists that made this monster an awesome adversary.  Caviezel is similar in so many ways with all the other heros, but with a few twists that made him more believable and more enjoyable.<br /><br />I have no idea why I never heard of this movie, or why it never made a serious release in the theaters.  All I know is that I am going to watch it many times more.
B00656C6KK|5.0|If you grew up watching her movies and listening to her songs, it is inevitable that a  new release from Doris Day is a celebration to rejoice.I have my British version and have ordered my American version of this CD earlier this month with the extra bonus song.Why Doris?Just listening to her voice makes you so feel you know her,like a friend ,you would love to welcome  her in your home.I hope her new CD will get an excellent response from the American public.She is a gem  worldwide and while she is still with us,let's help  her raise more funds for her animal welfare homes by buying her CD and either keeping it as  your personal copy or buying an extra copy as a gift for someone.It will be a lovely present.

B005URRCUY|4.0|Is it more refined than their previous albums? Yes. Does that mean that it isn't any good? Hell no! Bands music and sound evolve! People need to get over the fact that the songs sound different from the past and actually learn to appreciate new music.
1400069181|4.0|My little sister was the first person that I knew to own a pair of TOMS shoes.  I thought were cute, but not cute enough to warrant a $40+ pricetag.  So for several years I haven't really paid any attention to the company.  But then I read Blake Mycoskie's book, Start Something That Matters.  Now, I have completely bought into the TOMS vision.  Start Something That Matters is Mycoskie's way of helping to inspire others to do something great.  Whether that be through starting a new company, a non-profit, or just revolutionizing your existing workplace, it doesn't really matter---the insight that he offers pretty much applies across the board.  And while I'm not looking to start a new company or non-profit, I do want to change my workplace for the better.  My favorite chapter in this book was the \\"Build Trust\\" chapter.  Mycoskie included in it some great ways to inspire trust in your employees as well as with your customers, and some of these things are definitely implementable on my unit. Though I'm not the boss (nor do I ever want to be!), it only takes one person to make a difference and to be a catalyst for positive change, so I'm going to keep some of his ideas stored up and ready to go.  Start Something That Matters probably won't revolutionize your life, but hopefully it will inspire you to create positive change around you.  I know that it helped me when I was feeling frustrated.  I received this book (and the book I'm giving away) for free as a part of the Books for Bloggers Program, all opinions are 100% mine.
B005CM9DX6|4.0|I wasn't going to buy Heritage out of my respect and devotion to Blackwater Park and Ghost Reveries....and all releases prior. I struggled with and finally gave up on Watershed.  Lately I have been more receptive to Progressive Metal which isn't as heavy such as Riverside so I thought I'd give Heritage a try since it was commented on as very progressive.  I have only listened to this CD twice and I am shocked that I think it is outstanding. The track Folklore in particular is the most creative and progressive song I've heard in a long time and I'm just still...shocked. I can actually share this with my Wife and friends who can't get past the death metal vocals on prior releases which I do love and certainly still do miss.
B004ZNACA6|5.0|bought this for my British hubby, and he loves it. Nothing too fancy, mostly just the remastered music and a little bit of extras. Way more worth the money than the immersion sets, in my opinion. Artwork isn't original, but not bad. Personally I wouldn't have bought the actual product but just the MP3 set, but he likes the tangible stuff, and he wasn't disappointed, which is what matters.
B003Y74KCK|2.0|This case is really loose on the iPhone 4S. It adds the required \\"grippiness\\" but doesn't really keep much junk from getting to the phone. The port and button cut-outs do work for the Verizon 4S model.
B002PNAY9C|2.0|The only things that happens in this book is a lot of talking a ton of walking and so much camping I now have a serious aversion to the word. I love big books but i cant stand books that are big for no reason at all I beleive Christopher Paolini could have easily made this book the final one but he realized how much more money he could make if he split them and added a ton of useless fillers! Did we really need 10 chapters on dwarf politics that will in no way benefit the series! we all knew who was gonna be the new king the dwarves could have simply shown up at the camp proclaiming whom there new king is and saved a lot of time wasted on boring, dragging explanations of every little thing!  Another thing that really irritates me is the few intresting characters are barely diven any developement or time such as Angela. She obviously has a serious backstory but will he bother to flesh her out? NO! He would much rather wastetime on one-sided conversations with boring, uninteresting, generic characters! I mean Roran and Katrina are some of the most gag-worthy characters I have ever read. I liked the character of Nasuada but most of her side story was really quit boring and unessecary and added absolutely nothing to her characters background and very little to her characters personality. One character I would liked to have had their own narative would be Murtaugh so we can truly get another side of an intresting truly tormented character. He also changed the thing that made Aragorn, oops I mean Eragon an dynamic character he changed in an more obvious move (maybe the creators of Star Wars threatned to sue if he didnt change something).   Another incredably annoying thing is how Eragon has trouble killing animals nowadays but killing humans he doesnt even blink an eye he even murders one of Galbatorix begging servants that he forced to serve him but no not a bit of sympathy. And the constant conversations about whether or not its wrong to kill but yet it doesnt seem to bother him nore Roran the slighest bit! (if you truly want characters that truly think about whether killing is wrong I highly recomend the beautifully written Chaos Walking trilogy 15+).  now for the few upsides Eragon and Saphiras relationship is touching Arya is still a strong female exaple that are not usually in fantasy and the author at times can still have a few surprises. But sadly thats about all i can come up with but i could go on a couple paragraphs about what annoyed andf i think that in itself speaks volumes about this book.
0439023491|1.0|A friend loaned me a copy of Hunger Games and I devoured it in a couple of hours.  I found it to be an incredibly quick and engaging read.<br /><br />And then I started Catching Fire ...<br /><br />I don't even know where to start.  Katniss definitely came off a bit harsh (understandably so) in Hunger Games, but in the first couple chapters of Catching Fire it was just too much to take.  I couldn't read another paragraph about how she was sacrificing herself for those she loved because they weren't strong enough to handle the truth and she had to shield them.  It got to the point where I absolutely didn't care about her anymore.  She was just such an insufferable pain in the ass.<br /><br />I understand that as an author it's a fine line to walk between having a believably wounded character and a relateable character.  Collins did a great job of fleshing out Katniss's backstory.  I had no trouble believing that she had sufficient trauma in her life to give her a shell of armor.  But at the end of the day, she was just too hard, too martyred.  I stopped caring.

B0000013GT|5.0|Andre' Benjamin and Antwan Andre Patton (yes both share a name in common somewhere with me haha) are probably along with Mystikal two people who helped make Southern hip-hop a serious household name outside being novelty tunes for a few one hit wonders. And of course they're known for putting Georgia on the map the way...well Mystikal did the Crescent City. And of course when your dealing with the south and midwest,funk is just naturally going to flow in a certain sense naturally in cross sections of the culture. And that's about where this pair comes in. Both have very distinct personalities-both of which are on display on this second album. They always had a thing going. But their identity wasn't as heavily established until this album.  Featuring a modern day P-Funk style \\"cosmic\\" type concept illustrated comic form in the liner notes (worth reading) this album also lays down something of a concept musically. But there are also two halves of a whole to deal with her and that's important.<br /><br />  Opening up with the dramatic orchestration \\"You May Die\\",they next tune is...you guessed it: both these guys boasting about Cadillacs on \\"Two Dope Boyz\\". This does lay out the basic flavor for this album musically. Across numbers such as the title cut,the sexy \\"Jazzy Belle\\",\\"Elevators (Me & You)\\",\\"Babylon\\" and \\"Mainstream\\" Organized Noize have created a sleek bed of music with multiple flowing basslines,the funkiest keyboard loops possible that kind of amounts up to a kind of G-funk with a bit more of a twang to it. It flows but it also grooves hard a lot of the times. And identity is important because \\"Dre\\" (as Andre was calling himself than before Andre 3000 became his moniker) and Big Boi are kind of going about the same mission in different ways. Both are lightening speed rhymers with a heavy rhythmic sense-almost vocal even here. Sometimes even a bit hard to follow. But Dre at this point was with Erykah Badu,starting to play the guitar and developing interests in spiritualism of different sorts. And that effect his lyrical outlook.<br /><br />  Big Boi too is clearly not interested in being any conformist. But he where's his \\"hood cred\\" very proudly. So his approach is more aggressive and prone to a good deal of the same kind of sexist,violent and sometimes mildly childish posturing that is somewhat stereotypical of some hip-hoppers. It's not intended as mean spirited. But for those looking for something new in hip-hop and finding it here,his approach might serve to remind them of the very things in other hip-hop they're rejecting. And that duel nature but singular course became part of the whole OutKast attitude after this album. As the two developed somewhat more divergent courses creatively,the contrasts of style became harder to ignore. And eventually it got to the point where people were playing favorites between them and they just opted for separate projects. But at this point they were really playing up their whole \\"two heads on the same body\\" type of relationship. And continued to develop a broader interest in just about any music that was in the groove.ualism of different sorts. And that effect his lyrical outlook.

B0068TJLSY|1.0|I would seriously like to slap the snot out of whoever did the sound on this film. We rented this from Amazon. We have a home theatre system. The quiet conversations interspersed with frequent DEAFENING crashes, explosions, screams, etc. make it nearly unwatchable! I rode the remote the ENTIRE time, which is absolutely no fun, and my upstairs neighbors actually stomped on their livingroom floor at least 3 times because some of the scenes were so suddenly loud I couldn't possibly keep the volume at one steady level and still hear what the actors were saying.   Why do filmmakers do this? It's obnoxious. And this film is one of the worst offenders. I guess if we'd gone to see this in a theatre, we'd have come home with blood streaming from our ears. I'd really like to watch it again because the cast was uniformly great and the story attention-grabbing -- but I won't, because of this one issue. Had it not been a streaming rental and a DVD instead, I might have watched it again -- with English captioning and NO sound.

The legs did start to come off but it became her \\"bedtime baby\\" and I bought her a new one. It has ever lost its \\"new baby\\" smell even after all the countless washes and drying. I recommended this doll for every little girl. This will be one toy I put away and save for when she's older.

0756404746|1.0|I picked this book up because it had great reviews here on Amazon - and this experience has taught me to pay more attention to the poor reviews, and not just the good ones. I forced my way to the halfway point of this book, and then gave up. My biggest issue? I could never give a rat's tail about the main character. He'd have made a better \\"bad guy\\" you could at least hope would be killed off by book's end. Bleh. I recommend this book only for those who like big fantasy about self-absorbed, barely-drawn out characters. I'm donating my copy to the local library, so hopefully some others are spared having to *buy* this book to figure out it's not worth their time.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I decided to buy the book after seeing the theatrical trailer for the movie. Now I'm not sure if I'll even go see it in the cinema. Don't get me wrong - the book is amazing - but I'm afraid whatever they put on screen won't be able to measure up to it.   The storyline is amazing, but I'm not sure if the pacing would translate well into a movie. The same goes for the in-depth character development. How can you really communicate the background story of the main characters in some trailer-driven 90 minutes?  Suzanne Collins is without doubt a unique and talented writer, bringing some fresh wind through the genre with the start of this trilogy. If there's one thing to criticize though it's the naming choices. Minor point though.

0312641893|5.0|Where do I even begin with this book? I went in a little skeptical, unsure if I would really enjoy it or not. Quickly, though, I was sucked in. The first chapter kept me interested and each chapter urged me into the next. It was ridiculously difficult to convince myself to set it down long enough to do anything else. Needless to say, I finished the novel very quickly.<br /><br />I loved the characters. Cinder was convincing and real. She reacted the way I would have in most situations with which she faced. The choices she had to make were sometimes completely heart-wrenching, but it only enhanced the story. The fact that she is a cyborg really enhanced the story. It was very fun to read and such a fascinating, strange concept that I believed every single word of it. I loved the little descriptions of how she could feel the technology working in her body, sometimes against her human flesh. Another thing I loved about her was the fact that she works hard. This is sometimes hard to find in YA novels, but Cinder really works for what she gets. She doesn't just sit back and complain because her stepmother hates her and makes her work. She's good at what she does and she is just all around awesome.<br /><br />Cinder's stepsisters and stepmother were, of course, necessary characters, and I think they were done quite well. It was nice to see one of the stepsisters in a kinder light and to see the other stepsister and stepmother both had a degree of humanity in them. They are not one-dimensional, flat, lifeless characters who just hate Cinder for the sake of hatred. While yes, their motives behind the hatred may not be spot on, they are somewhat realistic and understandable. It will be interesting to see how these relationships develop in further stories.<br /><br />I thought Prince Kai was a great hero. I noticed several other reviewers did not agree with his ability to be so distracted by Cinder despite the utter pandemonium happening in his life, but I do not find myself agreeing at all. I think that even if your life is going crazy and you're unhappy and trying to figure out how to make it to the next day without going insane, you still need something to keep you afloat. For Prince Kai, this something was Cinder. The romance was also believable. I believed every word they said, every hope they dared dream, and every possibility of their togetherness.<br /><br />I also loved most of the miscellaneous minor plot quirks and secondary characters. I thought that restoring the car was fun, but I did wonder how she managed to learn to drive it. I loved Iko and I hope to see her again (a lot!) in future books. I loved the doctor and Cinder's storage compartment located in her leg and the descriptions of the city. The entire world was really beautiful and alive in my head, which always makes for a pleasant reading experience.<br /><br />The plot kept me completely entertained the entire time. While the story with the Lunar Queen was a little farfetched and, at times, almost a little silly and unbelievable, it was still interesting. I look forward to seeing how this particular plotline continues in future novels. Queen Levana is quite the formidable foe and I'm excited to see how Cinder knocks her down and picks up the pieces.<br /><br />To everyone who complained the questions were not answered: This is the first in a four book series! Of course not all the questions were answered! I'm sure questions will be answered later on and, if they are not, then you can go ahead and complain about it.<br /><br />My best advice? Just read the book! It was great! I can't wait to get my hands on the next novels in the Lunar Chronicles.even if your life is going crazy and you're unhappy and trying to figure out how to make it to the next day without going insane, you still need something to keep you afloat.

B000VE439Y|5.0|People who call Life of Brian a \\"heretical\\" or \\"blasphemous\\" movie must have been the same people who thought the Martians were really invading Earth when Orson Wells' War of the Worlds was broadcasted. They just weren't paying attention. Not to spoil the movie for those who haven't seen it, let's just say that if you're paying attention you will know that the movie is not about, nor does it mock, Jesus the person, the moral or religious leader, or the Chritian message.<br /><br />It DOES mock, though, authoritarian mentalities, political and religious, and organized religion. It DOES mock fractured, narrow-minded political oppositions, more interested in protocol than in political action, which was MP's commentary on the ineffectual British left in the late 70's. It DOES mock fanaticism. The movie shows how the quest for personal fulfillment can often lead to absurd results, MP's commentary no doubt to the human potential movement which was thriving at that time. Anybody who can recall an initiate of EST or who knows a Scientologist will know what I mean. And it DOES mock -- in a commentary more relevant to England than in the United States, but which is increasing becoming relevant here -- the effete nature of the Ruling Class. If you tend to be in favor of or gravitate to any of the above, you're probably going to be offended and not like the movie.<br /><br />What Life of Brian does NOT mock is the Chritian message. The only character in the movie who is presented in a respectful light is the person of Jesus Christ who is seen giving his sermon on the mount.
B002KSPKRS|5.0|I got this on Amazon for $99, and after a week with these headphones I am truly impressed. Surround sound on a wireless headset for this price is unbeatable. The sound is awesome and plugged my dr dre Beats studio in to see if the surround works and yes it does. I have it hooked into my 360, games and netflix sound great! I find that you get occasional pop noise on the wireless but it happens rarely. I will buy another for my surround sound in the bedroom because it works that good and will let me watch movies at night without waking my baby.
B004J4WKTW|3.0|I had mixed feelings about this book. I think Howard's idea was good but I kept waiting for an intense plot but nothing came. It could get boring at times and a little confusing. I think she did a wonderful job describing everything and she really showed you the magnifgance of the circus. I have to say I had mixed feelings about the book. In some ways it was worth reading
