B0061S073A|5.0|Excellent app.  Easy to set up.  Now I can let my preschooler play games on my phone and tablet without worrying about him opening other apps or changing anything.  Love the timer option too.
B00821OX98|5.0|I really enjoy the concept of the show, it's a simple plot - survival in a post apocalyptic alien invaded earth. Many of the characters have some good depth and a lot of room to explore. And the action is a lot of fun!
B000W94FE6|4.0|Some really good insights to make/ take the most of every single situation. Find a way to be in the flow
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I thought wonder was a great book and would recommend it to anyone. It was heart touching. I loved reading it.
B003VANOFY|5.0|I've owned this headset for about 7 months now and it's worked great.  The battery life has been impressive (about 8 hours on a full charge) and most importantly they can be used while charging so when the battery gets low they just become a normal headset.  Although the leather is quite comfortable, I've found my ears hurting a bit when I wear then for more than a few hours (3-5).  Nothing too bad, it usually means its break time.<br /><br />The range is more limited than I expected, but it hasn't impacted my usage at all.  They work anywhere in the room, but not really outside the room.  The other negative was that the software that comes with the headset isn't very good.  Logitech actually produces  a much better control panel that will let you bind any of the side buttons to any key you want.  The packaged software really limited me in what I could bind.<br /><br />Overall the voice quality is fantastic for sending and receiving, they are reasonably comfortable, and aren't too heavy.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Comfortable (for a few hours)<br />-Great sound quality (both sending and receiving)<br />-Long charge (8 hours)<br />-Can use while charging (BIG plus)<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Range is limited but works fine in the same room.  Range is drastically limited and even unusable if you place the receiver in a bad location.  Move it around to find the best spot and it's great.<br />-The packaged software will give you basic options but leaves you unable to do any exciting.  &#34;Logitech Gaming Software&#34; is freely available on the Logitech site and will let you bind any button on the headset to any key.  It took me a while to find this as I don't own any other Logitech devices with hotkeys.<br /><br />Other:<br />The headset fits me a little loosely even when adjusted as small as it can go.  The earpieces are designed to move to so that it fits better, which it does.  However, sometimes I find that becomes the earpeices move the headset doesn't fit as snugly as my old gaming headset used to.  This isn't really a pro or con but I imagine if your head is smaller or bigger than it's designed for this might be uncomfortable.
B00AFPVPDG|5.0|The concept is powerful and seemingly easy to implement... I am going to use this to MAKE the time to learn...
B0089LOG02|5.0|I was afraid this was going to be depressing, but i was surprised. It provided details on a time and process I had not known. Loved...loved the ending.
0525478817|5.0|I really loved it, and enjoyed every chapter of the book. It is kind of sad but it is an ugly truth
B009UX2YAC|4.0|There is a problem with my tablet I do no know how I suddenly start the game all over again like literally from tutorials and all that I don't even have coco anymore or the amount of Eiffel towers this is not fair!
B008G3N71W|3.0|Strange , steamy and erotic.....but it was very weird to me. Not sure if it is totally believable. Just different....
1609611543|5.0|Once I picked up this book, I didn't put it down until I was thru.  Very interesting and smart reading.  I realized various issues I have been having and very quickly learned how all of them could and would be reversed.  In just a matter of days, I started to lose weight and feeling better.  I am over 55 woman, and pre-diabetic, but thanks to this book, I will never be on insulin and know I will be healthy once again.  I don't use &#34;traditional&#34; medicine but prefer a holistic approach so this works in quite nicely with my lifestyle.  Have not missed not eating wheat and all the other stuff at all!  I have also gotten the WB cookbook - fantastic recipes!  My friends all know of this journey and they are already considering changing their eating habits as well.  Thank you, Dr. Davis!!
B007L5LD9O|3.0|I watched this movie for a class as it is based off the Jane Austen book.<br /><br />It was pretty tedious
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|It's not as hard as I thought it would be once I got used to steering, but my wife says I look like an idiot playing it because I lean into the curves & hop up when the dune buggy jumps.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Held me the entire time. Well written and all the ingredients of Mistery. Would recommend as follow-up. Very good day.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Well written, with twists! Fun to read. Relatable. Hard to put down. Thriller, love story and murder type mystery. I'd be interested in more by this author.
B005C8ENI0|4.0|Acting and writing were top notch. Great story but could have used a little more action. Very enjoyable.I would recommend!
B001EBWITA|5.0|I like the whole concept of good versus evil. Keanu and Rachel are two of my favorite actors. The special effects are excellent in this movie. The price was amazing as well!
B004SRPXWQ|5.0|this app is good for kids and easy to use by them to play with tom. i wish it had more features and options for free.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This started out as my favorite and finishes the same. Thank you so much for this game. I am grateful!!
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|Exceptional writing, vivid action scenes, unparalleled world building. This is a work that I will read again and again in anticipation of the sequel. Mr. Ryan has created a whole new world and given my new friends in which to journey with in Blood Song. I only stopped my reading of this book to charge the battery in my kindle.
B001ANYDAO|5.0|As a public school teacher for almost 40 years, I read this book with a jaundiced eye. How many dozens of books have I read that purport to have the answers to what is wrong with American public schools? In a sentence, Gladwell' s book can be summarized by the aphorism, \\"Practice makes perfect.\\" However, the role of luck in being successful is frequently ignored, but Gladwell explores all of the cultural and historical advantages that others miss. The one advantage I wish he had explored in more depth is being born into a family that values education and teaches its members to value it, too.  The one thing I feel that I struggle against  daily is a lack of interest in learning on the part of students and their families. The average parent who fills out a questionnaire that I send home at the beginning of the school year  chooses a HALF HOUR of homework as the maximum amount per night they want their child to have for math and science. Gladwell talks about the value of allowing a student to spend 20 minutes on one problem! I totally agree with the premise that children from lower socioeconomic classes need more time in school to be successful, but his statistics show that children from more affluent families learn more during their enriched summer vacation experiences than they do in school. It appears that one type of public school experience does not meet the needs of all students. What a shock.<br />The book is not about just education, though. Each chapter explores success and failure--as in airline crashes-- within the complicated contexts in which they occur. Yet the explanations are anything but complicated. The book is humorous and a quick read.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Great puzzles and story line.  I finished  it in one sitting because I couldn't put it down.  Good for my kids too!
B0095MVOMC|1.0|I was really excited about this game because I like the \\"Hidden\\" games. However when my anti virus program pop up suggesting there might be something harmful in there. I had to delete it. That is the reason I gave it one star.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I really like the Fallout games so I am somewhat biased toward post-apocalyptic stories. I read the omnibus edition of this, and went through quickly. It was hard to put aside and do work and such and that is rare in a book for me. The setting, the characters and the slowly evolving picture of the world was all great.
B000I8G5B2|5.0|Great DVD, excellent movie for education and pleasure.<br />I view this movie with my Biology students after completion of the genetics unit.
B000EZ7ZZE|1.0|Wow, the first Resident Evil movie was nothing amazing or original but it was a decent, competently made little sci-fi/action/horror flick but this sequel manages to be worse in just about every possible way. Visually the movie looks terrible and shockingly it had a bigger budget than the first movie, never would've guessed that looking at the movie, many times when the zombies appear on screen the picture gets all distorted and the framerate becomes almost like a slideshow, if this was a really low budget movie I would say it was a technical issue but seeing as how it wasn't this was clearly deliberate and why any director would go out of their way to make their movie look as awful as possible is just beyond any logic or coherence. Aside from the that it's also filled with lots of extreme quick cutting, cheap post production looking slow mo, and the action scenes filmed mainly in close ups with quick cutting and shakiness make em utterly unwatchable.<br /><br />Music wise it's very bland forgettable techno-ish stuff that lacks the memorable factor of Manson's music from the first movie. For an R rated zombie movie there's not really any blood or gore at all, aside from some F bombs and a few boob shots it feels much more like a PG-13. Aside from Oded Fehr none of the acting is particularily good, even Jovovich is off but I blame the director more than her. Also the big giant monster in the movie suddenly turns good and almost cries, yeah really lame. Easily the worst of the Resident Evil movies and one of the worst mainstream movies of the past decade, it's honestly right up or should I say below there with the average Uwe Boll movie.
B00DBSZJRM|2.0|I am a sci-fi freak and loved the weapons that obvious did not fit the time period. It had the potential to be a real non-stop romp of violence. So why my problem with the f-bomb? It didn't work that's all. When it came out of their mouths, it was like...REALLY? They weren't edgy enough already? I guess throwing that into a fun movie seems like they're thumbing their noses at someone who doesn't really care. Just sayin'.
B009MO5960|5.0|5th installment in the Resident Evil series and by this point you should basically know what to expect. Of all the big action movies to come out in 2012 this was easily my favorite. It's not heavy on plot or characters but if you're willing to relax and enjoy some mindless action for 90 minutes while enjoying some very eye pleasing ladies along with a great soundtrack by TomandAndy then you'll get some fun out of this. This along with Expendables 2 were easily the most fun movies of 2012.
B006FO3ERQ|3.0|Great read about how life can take some strange turns and the impact that decisions of adults make can have on the lives of those who depend upon them.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Best series on PBS. I Highly recommend al 3 seasons. Don't want to spoil the season but it is a must watch TV.
B008JGSM6G|1.0|When a gameoes not move, no matter what you click on, and there are NO instructions, I don't want it.  This is not the first and I suppect won't be the last.  Sorry, most of the games I have, I really, really like.  Thank you.  Dorothy
B00CH26TL8|5.0|This is a match three game that all would love. Young and old. I have shared it with all my friends and family.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|For being a free games it's the best one I've played. However the pay to be epic power is annoying. maybe if it weren't so darn expensive people would pay for it.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|My 4 year old loves playing this with me. It's a fun non-violent game. Can be addictive. It's hard to put down.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I like this game it's very fun for everyone not just little kids I play this game with my brother
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Hill climb racing is a really great game and its really enjoyable. I play this game everyday and never get tired of it
B009LMTDL0|5.0|I enjoyed this book very much.  She has a fresh way of looking at women's issues which are perfect for our time.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|my husbend playes the temple run and is addicted to it I never played and thought it was dumb but then I found this App and tried it!! I love it thanks
B005BRS8Z6|4.0|Seems like common sense.  I related with some of your book. I think there is daily struggle with good and bad, fear and strength, success and failure. The dilemma is, which side of the fence are you going to fall on that day.
B00CHSPB8Y|1.0|The game is very repetitive and frankly the graphics suck from gameloft I would have expected better dont waste your space get a good game not this one.
B00BB8SKPW|1.0|Very disappointing that the first minutes of this movie are borderline porn! I finally stopped it! I have no idea if the movie is good or not. I just know that if you like porn, you'll love it. If you don't..beware!!!!!
B000002KGT|5.0|Ageless Fleetwood Mac. Timeless classics every collection should contain. Not a poor song on the disc, one of the best albums of all time.
B00COGXX7A|5.0|Is there anything Julianne Hough can't do? Very good movie! Decent enough.. for adults only though. One kind of steamy scene. Otherwise only a little violence.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|Loved the book and loved the movie.  Definitely one I will watch over and over again.  Shows that sticking to &#34;doing the right thing&#34; pays off in the end.
B002SRQ214|5.0|no flaws here - runs great - stock fan keeps it cool.. great price for a quad core, did have to add a case fan on older model tower ...
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Great program! You can't just start at season3, you need to know what happens from seasons 1 & 2. My wife and  i enjoys this program immensely.
B007DIQC90|5.0|I first this band on our eclectic radio station and was immediately wowed by their sound and energy, look for more from this band in the coming future, worth the listen....
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I am so hooked on Downton Abbey that I am spacing the series out.  Love it well worth the price.
0545265355|5.0|My grand daughter was thrilled with this, she had already read \\"The Hunger Games\\" she thoughtfully gave it to a good friend, and is now well into \\"Catching Fire\\" .. :) very, very happy!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|it it it was was was awesome cool great but it needs more levels and more tricks and stuff<br />bye
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I was hooked from the very beginning. Some parts I really had to think about it. I wasn't quite sure of what I was looking for. I can't Waite for the additional rooms.
B00AYM6JFO|3.0|Somewhat disappointed. The content could have been better, maybe with more performers singing with him. I have other cd's by him and really like them.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is a awsome free game keep up the good work<br />Plus with this game I hope u put skins in it
B00CF34B2I|5.0|This app gives you a real chance to try out the game before purchasing the whole game. Definitely worth the time to try out!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|as always, George RR Martin has written an excellent book. The ending is a hell of a cliff hanger, and I can't wait for the next volume to come out to clear up some things!
B008LY9AWG|2.0|The stories were simply not that engaging. Don't waste your money. I love the Michael Connelly's Lincoln Lawyer books, but not Mulholland Dive. Disappointing purchase.
193700788X|4.0|Story line was back into her creative bent.  I wish the ending was different.  The author has lost her love of the characters in her story.
B00992CF6W|5.0|WThis is a great game I built my best world on here I am pleased by this game hee her
B000TM1CKQ|3.0|I started out liking this series but as episodes passed I became disenchanted. It became predictable and I really began to detest Lilly's meat stick.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|Loved this game from start to finish.  Well, I didn't fully finish it yet.  Game was pretty simple until waves 40 and up.  After you beat me level 50, you may replay past levels that you previously beat, or play as zombies instead.  Only problem is you need gold to level up your gear and soldiers, but it's still beatable anyway.
B000HT3P7E|4.0|This first season was funny as it progressed I began liking it less and less. The interaction between the main characters began to get predictable and I thought insipid.
B00CHSPB8Y|3.0|Pretty fun game.  Awesome story based missions and graphics.  The bad part is the game is pretty darn hard if you don&acute;t buy the in game currency.  Everything looks as if it can become unlocked by playing free, but it will take a very long time of heavy gameplay to achieve it.  I like it, I just think it pushes players to buy to much.
B0000AQS6R|5.0|I watch this movie every year at Christmas time. I love it that much. It is sooo funny and well done. The nuances are so well done and understated and I love the cat scene!!!
B005544TRQ|5.0|The writers of Suits have struck a fine balance between character development and plot twists that make the show interesting every step of the way.
0345529057|5.0|Just finishing up the second book in the series - A Clash of Kings.  Needless to say, very hard to put down and since I read every night before bedtime, I have to push myself to close the book since I want to find out what happens next.  I love this series.
B006LMMN8I|5.0|Gregory Porter is the person to watch. It is refreshing to hear a new, and excellent voice with some good old school lyrical foundation. He will be a person to watch as he move forward. Great production.
B00AVFO41K|4.0|The colors are pretty, the game is simple enough to learn and play.  It occasionally has a small glitch and won't let me move a piece to the spot where I want to put it, but not enough of a problem to hamper the fun.
B002ZTQVGQ|5.0|Watched it on TV and recently purchased it for my granddaughter<br />Such a good movie.  My granddaughter loves it too
B00BC24NT4|3.0|John Le Carre has done much better in previous novels--no comparison.  This just doesn't measure up to any of the others.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|This is a great game. I really enjoy playing this as an alternative solitaire  game then free cell and spider. It also has great commentary and the gofer is really cute.
B0026QC0TA|4.0|OK movie, good lessons regarding insurance, tobacco use, peoples inability to fight big corporations, etc.  Good characters and good acting
B0020BUWX2|5.0|I read this book while on vacation in very quick order!  The author does a wonderful job with the flow of the story that really covers only one day in the main character's life.  The weaving of past and present was excellent, and I couldn't wait to find out what happened in the next book.  I picked it up immediately following the last page of this one.  I feel like I know the main character inside and out!  She and her family, her boyfriend and her friend will stay with me for a long time.
0307742539|5.0|This was a great book- I read it a while ago, so details are a bit foggy- but I loved all the books in this series. The finale was everything I hoped it would be. I highly recommend these books!
B004H4XDBI|5.0|It's very hard to decide which story I liked better---this one or the first book, If I Stay.  I read both of them very quickly while on vacation, and they did not disappoint!  The rocker boyfriend angle in this one got me thinking about how all the choices we make in life affect others.  Every single choice affects another---sometimes the choices are good and sometimes they just leave things unfinished.  This story will leave you wrestling with your own unfinished relationships and the need for closure.  I would recommend these two books to any of my friends!
B00BWBHIUG|1.0|When I started out playing this game it was very fun.  Then Disney made you download a new version (you were given no choice) and things changed.  It's all about spending your bubbles.  The magic chests for the most part want you to open for 6 bubbles and you get a pitiful amount of sand dollars in return.<br /><br />The quests are all about opening the chests so I can't see how children can fulfill their \\"homework assignments\\" without getting their parents to spend money on bubbles.  They just had a promotion this weekend where you virtually had to spend 80 bubbles in order to get a stingray to magically appear in your reef. They sucked the fun right out of the game.  Nemo used to talk about the plants and as the levels progress there is no dialogue.<br />I'm really colossally disappointed in Disney!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|The author of this book draws you in immediately, and his ability to paint pictures with words is magnificent!  It's even hard to describe how he does it, but he does!  It has a creepy, loving, realistic, sad, intense tone.  The way he describes things come to life from the pages with full color. (You'll understand more when you get reading!)  I love books that give you history and story in one, and this one fits the bill.  It stirred my soul and I would recommend this read to my friends.  I would love a follow up book to see where Liesel goes in life after Himmel Street.  Just a wonderfully well-written book that does not disappoint!
B0095MVOMC|5.0|The first free app of the day for July Thirteen, Two Thousand And Thirteen, is Hidden Numbers from Agile Fusion Studios.<br /><br />Here is an example where the game publisher takes the Hidden concept to a new level.  Not only do you get to look for hidden numbers in this app, you also get the opportunity to look for hidden ads.<br /><br />Running this app you will find ads hidden in at least three places.  HINT: Two of the hidden places are on the main menu and one of those two is actually in plain sight for a find the hidden items app!<br /><br />Everything you would typically expect to find in a hidden number game is here.  There are hints, a zooming feature, a countdown clock, etc.  One major drawback with this app is that the numbers are often so large in each scene that there isn't much point to implement a zoom in feature.  If you are going to implement a zoom in feature, try to make it so it is required to find several of the numbers.  Another problem was that some numbers were a little bit cut off the screen.  But the biggest problem with this app is that it has very little replay value unless you have a kid who doesn't care about doing the same scenes over again with the numbers in the exact same places each time.<br /><br />Even though I heard several reports of a virus in this app, I am going to give this app a higher rating for now unless I discover these problems myself.  My rating is hidden in this review.  So here is your important hint to finding my real rating for this app (assuming I don't lower my rating later which might happen like it did the other day on the Skating app):  Take the first letters of certain sentences in this review and it will spell a number between one and five.
B0074VTHKM|5.0|This is a very refreshing book and I hope John Grisham writes more on Theodore Boone and his character grows up and does get his law degree.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|What is not to like?  It is a black cable with molded connects.  Of course, the durability will depend on the users environment and usage.
B009ZQC7MY|3.0|The broadcast version from PBS had much better quality video.<br />Also this version had some scenes missing or cut short
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|I had wanted to watch this series for awhile now. I had no idea I would get so addicted. Phenomenal show in every way
B0084IHVC0|5.0|We had watched &#34;Lady and The Tramp&#34; so this was a logical addition to the afternoon &#34;quiet time&#34; viewing.<br />He really enjoyed the story.
B00D6BN9NK|2.0|Car chase, shoot a bunch of crap, throw in Bruce Willis.... and you've got this version of Die Hard.  Terrible. There's no intro, no plot, no plot twists, no funny one liners.  I loved all the other diehards.  This one shouldn't be called Die Hard.  Maybe they were introducing a new main character... Bruce Willis looked old and tired.
B004KBSQBA|3.0|I was hoping for stronger back up from African musicians. It was typical Paul Simon. Not my cup of tea.
B00DGNOMB6|5.0|This is the best movie I have seen in months.  We loved everything about it and have watched it twice already.
B000KJZWMW|5.0|A classic of its type - and not for everyone, but for those who like Mel Gibson and his adventures in the down under, it is fun to watch.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|This Kindle USB cable is exactly as expected. Came new in pristine condition... Great shipping... Box didn't have a single crush mark.
B00B37RYMQ|5.0|The  difficulty with the multitude of Kindle formats is finding one you like.  The 200th Anniversary Edition, with period illustrations, is delightful.
B0007TKNII|5.0|I love this movie!  I know it didn't do well at the box office, but I think that was out of anger from hardcore fans that wanted Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman in the lead roles.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Enjoy app , but to advance for my children and can become pricey. Good rating overall. Would like gems easier to obtain.
B006GHA9QQ|4.0|This is a good story and follow up to &#34;Phantom&#34;, a lot of people will not be happy with the story end and how it does not coincide with the Phantom movie, but I like it and recommend it.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|What a fun game.  Big fish did it again!  I could play for hours and still enjoy the game.  When I see a game made by Big Fish, then it is sure to be a winner.  Thank you, Big Fish!!<br /><br />countrygal7775@aol.com
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I like the improvements,it is easier to use. I liked it before but I like it so much better now!
B005ERYEGU|5.0|We had been doing some similar things in years past but this really brought it all together for our company. This guy is a visionary. I was skeptical initially until we put together a campaign exactly as directed and got $3500 in business from it within 24 hours. Good stuff. Highly recommended for small companies and startups. Reduces the learning curve.
B00COGY2P2|5.0|Great tom cruise film! All about the action without the oh-so-predictable budding love story behind it.  Rosamumd Pike was wonderful too.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|The game was interesting enough but went by much too quickly. The puzzles were far too easy. With that said, this would be great for an 8 to 10 year old to play.
B0083ZRAJS|4.0|I really enjoyed reading The Wonderful Wizard of Oz! I have only watched the film's and it was so much different then what I had thought it to be. I look forward to reading . Again with my children.
B00A77II0U|5.0|I highly recommend Dollhouse Story. This had a great story line, lots of twists and turns with a good variety of puzzles. Buy it, play it, love it.
B008Y7N7JW|1.0|Typical love triangle with the heroine in the middle. The story has merits but the execution of portraying that story fell short. If your over 15 I don't recommend. So many better options out there for your time.
B0043JDUNS|5.0|Great sequal to the original movie.....Robert Downey Jr delivers again with more smart narrative and lots of action too!  Im a bit behind on my movie watching so i cant wait to see Iron Man 3 now!
B005544TRQ|5.0|Great chemistry between the main characters and fun comedy. There's always something happening that will entice you to watch the next episode until... you're done them all! Looking forward to the next season!
B001KZG99A|5.0|Love Robert Downey Jr in this movie! Great action, plot and actors. ..... Also great movie for nearly all ages.
B009X010RU|5.0|easy to store, easy to wipe off if something gets on it.  I seldom stand it, but is fine when I do
B0031YJFCQ|2.0|I liked the first book the best.  The second one was ok but this one just stretched it all too far.  Too much statistics and pages of asides re government policy etc.  I skipped over most of that.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I really like this game but I am stuck on level 10.  There are three circles with numbers in the CENTER and I can't figure out the combination.  I have done fine up until now.  I have kept going back to it for a few days and just can't figure it out.  Help!
B0065GC0BA|4.0|Wonderfully written, visually expressive, I felt like I was part of the novel. Jojo is a brilliant author you won't ever be disappointed in any of the novels. Just brilliant. W
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Just started it and I find it interesting and challenging.  A different way to think and play.  No real idea of where I will end up.
1452113432|5.0|I have not seen the cooking show but found this little gem of a cookbook on an amazon recommendation.  This book is so wonderful, it doesn't leave my kitchen and I have a huge library of cookbooks.  Every recipe I have tried, which have been several have been fairly easy and turned out flawless.  I will be using some of these recipes for entertaining because I know that they taste great and are easy enough that I will be able to enjoy preparing for company and not be in the kitchen for days ahead of time without sacrificing quality :)  Buy this book it is a keeper!
B005544TRQ|4.0|Suits is a smart and funny show, a different tone than the usual law firm type shows. It's a lot more clever with better written characters you'll fund elsewhere. Plus Rachel is Hot.
B008JOLG7U|4.0|Downloaded MP3, music plays really well, another great album from Jennifer Lopez. She always seems to be able to originate<br />dance songs for all age groups.

B009GX69RK|5.0|I watched the first season on Netflix & fell in love with it!! I had to watch more of it & this is where I came to purchase more episodes. It's funny & the characters are awesome & funny!
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|Downloaded for my daughter, problem is she doesn't read yet so hard for her to do by herself. The bigger problem I play it now.
0064400018|5.0|Excellent book-  needed it to complete my set. I am reading it to my 3 year old- she loves! Thank so much!
B00DC7N9NS|1.0|This movie was awful. Very disappointing after being excited to see it. It was frenetic, seemed to be poorly done and the plot was odd. I didn't even make it through to the end. Save your money.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|I have used the Weather Channel app for my iPhone and Kindle Fire for awhile now and this recent makeover they've done has me looking for another weather app.  Between the ads and the sensational non-existent stories cluttering up the page, I have a much more difficult time navigating the app to find relevant weather stats and forecasts than I ever did on their previous, cleaner looking app.  Overall, while I like the more specific forecast information, I hate using an app that requires extremely precise finger taps if you don't want to accidentally leave the app and open a new Safari tab.  Two stars instead of one because I appreciate the new and improved information.
B005544TRQ|5.0|5 Stars! Love it! Outstanding repartee. My husband is a lawyer and finds this stimulating entertainment. I am eagerly anticipating Season 4.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Great read. Thoroughly enjoyable. Kept my interest going page after page. Recommended to all my book club friends and they agreed.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Khaled Hosseini delivers another masterpiece. While very ambitious with its many characters and plots, he still delivers a solid story of love, loss, culture, and the undying ties of family. Beautifully written.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|it is great for the kids its just like temple run but better u will love it too please get it will be a blast
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a ridiculous, fun, and absolutely addictive game. I have not been able to stop. Fun for all ages, even us parents. :)
B007REV4YI|5.0|Excellent installment of the Bond franchise...addded to my collection.Can't wait for the next Bond film to come out to add it on.
B00CFNUMD0|4.0|Shaun is back for more adventure. My five year old really enjoys him for some reason, even if Shaun doesn't talk. The body language transcends as humor is any format.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Movie is awesome !  Great entertainment. This is our 2nd viewing and it is really a great movie.Highly recommended.<br />May watch again.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Awesome game my child loves it<br />And in all honesty so do I. The minions are adorable must see the second movie.
B0051ANPZQ|4.0|This book is very entertaining but I gave it 4 stars because it did get a little annoying at some point's. And some grammar was  wrong, but overall I would suggest this book  to anybody!
078322737X|5.0|Hubby asked for this for Father's Day and found it on Amazon!  If you have the soundtrack you have to have the movie too.
0893860468|5.0|My husband has been reading this book and really enjoys it.  I will be reading it as soon as he is finished with it.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|I give this movie a five star rating because I really liked it! The acting was great; the story was intense; and the ending was happy. The only thing I did not like about the movie was that the German bounty hunter died but such is life. I would recommend this movie to everyone. Why not? It was very entertaining.
B00BNGFGIQ|2.0|Well, this game was kind of fun for about 10 minutes, until the game froze up and the monkey wouldn't move.  Even pressing the restart button and the menu button didn't help either.  They should really test these things before they release them to the public.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I had to start with the first Jack Reacher Novel, after seeing the movie....i have enjoyed both...and love the parts where he is just &#34;thinking&#34;, before the action takes place
B0055PGUYU|5.0|A phenomenal book to better understand habits. Educational and entertaining. Difficult to put it down. Highly recommend for business and casual readers.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Good game to kill an hour until the end level. Basic app and interface. Can be easy at times. Appreciate different methods to unlock hidden treasures
B005544V6A|5.0|Lots of twists and turns. Great show about loyalty, trust, and law. Great cast with unbelievable chemistry. Can't wait for season three.
B00459EZLW|5.0|I really liked this series. For me, they were just getting into the story when the series ended. This season was even better then the 1st one and definitely worth watching.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|This latest version of the Weather channel app is terrible.  It constantly freezes on me.  When I open the app it goes directly to &#34;my locations&#34; an stays there.  I end up having to remove the app and then download it again.  Then of course I have to put in all my locations again.  I don't know if this is just happening on the kindle version or all versions.
B009VSW15Y|3.0|it would work great if it had 2 cameras as it stands wright now you take pictures of your self and that's no fun.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Gr 8  (great) little app.  Does all the basics without confusion.  Even has a memory. Not for Einstein  but excellent for shopping, checking percentages on sales., figuring  overtime, and more. I use it almost everyday!
B004P1JDJO|5.0|This book shows why much of the work force is set up incorrectly. Motivation must be nurtured not forced. This is a good book for educators as they try to motivate students.
B00CTKHXFO|1.0|I've read online for years about how great these games were so when I saw \\"The Legacy Collection\\", I thought this would be a great chance to play some of the best games ever made.  I played some of Metal Gear, Metal Gear 2, Metal Gear Solid 1, and Metal Gear Solid 4 and have now given up on the series.  I know I'm going to get slammed for giving this game a poor review (look at how many comments the other 1 star reviews got) by people that are fanatical about this VIDEO GAME for no apparent reason.<br /><br />So what do I think of these games?  Metal Gear 1 and 2 are really old as expected but frankly they're just too hard - even on easy.  It's nothing but trial and error.  This is most definitely NOT fun.<br /><br />So I skipped to MGS1 thinking surely a PS1 game wouldn't be so bad, I was wrong.  It's the same as the old games except \\"better\\" (still ugly) graphics.  It took me half an hour to figure out how to get into the elevator at the very start of the game and once I got into a hanger full of tanks, I wandered around and couldn't figure out what to do.  The alarm kept getting turned on until I figured out that you're supposed to look at this small box on the top right corner, \\"the radar\\" (people radar that shows where they're looking).  So now I'm able to avoid getting spotted by the enemies but the moment I watch my character I get caught again.  In other words, you have this large TV screen and all you're really able to look at is this ugly box on the top right corner.  That's terrible game design if I've ever seen it.  Why create all these art assets then force the player to look at some ugly radar the whole time?  Anyway, the \\"tank hanger\\" is a room with a bunch of locked doors that I can't open.  Finally I realize there's a vent on the floor.  I crawl into the vent and BOOM the graphics went from bad to worse.  You've got a first person perspective but everything is super pixelated.  I realize that this game was made for standard definition TV's but I wasn't expecting it to look so bad on an HDTV that I couldn't tell where I was going.  To make matters worse, it's dark so I had to crawl backwards to be able to tell if I was moving.  Eventually I got to a dead end and had to exit the vent.  I have no idea if there was a way out that I missed but considering I moved around in the vent for an hour and didn't find the exit, I really doubt it.  I spent a total of 3 hours on this game and frankly, it's the same trial and error type of game that the regular Metal Gear games were.<br /><br />So I popped in MGS4.  By this point I've already realized that these games are not for me but I figured I should take a look at the most modern version.  The game is nothing but cut scenes.  If you're going to have your character walk 2 feet then have a cut scene then walk 2 feet more then have another cut scene, why even bother with the walking?  I have no problem with cut scenes in games though I do have a problem with this game's implementation of them.  To make matters worse, the gameplay is really just more of the same.<br /><br />To sum all of this up, from the perspective of a newcomer to the series, I would not recommend you listen to or read reviews by fans of the series.  It's mostly nostalgia talking.  If you like playing games to relax and have fun then this game is most definitely not for you.  This game series consists of a bunch of what people call \\"stealth\\" sequences but what really amount to really annoying puzzles where you watch a guard walk back and forth then RUN when he's got his back turned.  If you want to play games that have annoying \\"stealth\\" puzzles, are stressful, and are downright brutal to the player - even on easy, then this set is for you.  If you've never played these games before, you need to ask yourself if you play games to have fun and if the answer is yes you play games for fun then stay away from this these games.
B000FCKPHG|5.0|This is a wonderful book that has changed how I teach. I never cared about &#34;grades&#34; as a teacher just learning and now I have some validation to this idea.

B007I2BZIE|4.0|I was looking for a good drummer, so that I could buy CDs for my grandson who is learning the drums and plays in his school band. I found that the drumming is great on this album and I enjoyed the music as well. I'm not normally into rock music, but I do enjoy listening to this CD.

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It's a basic calculator that has a simple sleek display.  The number keys and displayed information are large  enough that you don't have to strain your eyes.  Simple app that's user friendly for all ages.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I love this game  I played it multiple times. Canter enough. I want the second one . It's too good to pass up.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Best game app I've played. Reminded me a lot of the old Myst computer games.  Hope to see more in the series soon.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I'm about 5 days from finishing the 30 day shred and am very happy I made this purchase.  My top two abdominal muscles are starting to come in and I'm looking forward to seeing more progress :)
B000FCKGPC|3.0|If you are into the series this is OK, but definitely the weakest of all to date.  This is interesting in regard to story, but the writing is weaker and it's peopled with characters that Martin has not done as well, either before or during this book, in painting for his audience.  So it just doesn't have the grip that others have.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Very fun game lots of detail and real life horse routines and is good game to pass time with!!!!!!!!!!!! We . Love this game

B000P407K4|5.0|Not your typical end of the world movie.  Peter Sellers is outstanding in several roles.  George C. Scott is tremendous.  Very tense, scary, but at the same time outrageously funny.  I will watch this movie again.
B0058SNI94|4.0|I've always hated the croc clogs, everyone wearing them states yeah they're ugly but soo comfortable! I saw these by accident, and was surprised that they were croc shoes, theyre just so cute... I love them!! they are my new work shoes...

B00CDV6WDS|5.0|three words: choices, choices, and more choices!! different boards to master and different backgrounds to use during play keeps me coming back! Awesome that I got the game free, but for 99&cent; this game is a steal for mahjong lover's like me.
B00008QSA5|5.0|I have been a fan of Al Kooper since his brief stint with Blood, Sweat & Tears.<br />In my opinion, BST's first album. &#34;Child is Father to the Man&#34; is one of the finest rock albums ever.<br />Primarily due to Al Kooper.  If you haven't listened to it, you should
B009IJJB8G|2.0|I don't find this show interesting at all.  It is just like all of the other crime shows.  Sherlock is just another kind of Mentalist or Castle.  I don't like the characters and the plots are predictable.  I really wanted to like this show,  but I can't get into it. Sigh.
B000NOKA0S|5.0|I first bought the LP in 1968.  Lost it many years ago.<br />Great lyrics.  Very glad to now have the CD

B003M6FGTE|4.0|If you like musicals. I think you will enjoy this. The show has a story line and you want to see how things turn out.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Emotionally compelling.  Enjoyable read.  A bit far fetched, but very amusing if not taken too seriously.  Sad it's finished. Good book.
0345529057|5.0|Love the show, the books are opening up new understanding.  Great reading and looking forward continuation of the saga.  Will get the next book in series as soon as available in paperback.

B0050DIWFC|5.0|This is a great story. I couldn't wait to see what would happen next.  The ending will surprise you and made the story.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game. The minions are sooooo cute. And graphics are great. This game is much better then temple run and subway surfers.
B006Y5H74W|5.0|I love the music and dance. Very realistic, not too much soap opera.<br />The cast is wonderful and very talented.
B00BZODDYU|3.0|Predictable, typical 'gotcha' moments but a reasonably considered plot if poorly executed. The audience has little invested in the focal characters so the impact of the haunting is really minimal. The little girls are excellent actors.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. If you don't like your books to be on the realistic side, I wouldn't recommend this book.
B0092SQ5EG|3.0|An interesting look at a current pop star and an overall good PR piece to help spur her career. Got it for lack of anything more interesting and left oddly satisfied.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Excellent ending that reinvents the novel from the first word.  Vivid storytelling and fascinating narrative find amazing meaning in the conclusion.
B00CL50LEC|1.0|Really, zombies that cure themselves? They might have been going for something deeper but for entertainment value; pathetic and disappointing.

B0035S996U|4.0|Had to illustrate a 'classic' movie to my kids. It was hilarious seeing all the 'gangs' and watching the less than choreographed fight scenes. What a great waste of an afternoon :)
B0046B8GEQ|1.0|After hearing friends comment on how funny the sequel to this movie was, we decided to check out the original and see if we would like to go the the theater and watch Despicable Me 2.  We suffered through about 30 minutes of this movie and turned it off.  It was truly despicable and I can not imagine showing this to a child.  I am angry that we wasted our time and money on this frenetic and confusing mess. The characters were predictable and I wonder why we have to show evil to children?  The world is confusing and violent enough...I feel sad that so much money and time and talent was wasted on this soulless movie.
034580709X|1.0|Have always liked Nesbo but this book was maudlin, melancholy and the mystery was not very engaging.save your money. Sorry to disappoint.
B005HEPN06|5.0|Love this show from my childhood. They just don't make Shows like this any more. I love the adventures and the character interactions
1781162646|5.0|I enjoyed this book. I finished it in a day. Not so much on the blood and gore nor the creepy sex that he usually adds. I enjoyed the book and would recommend it to even the younger crowd. Think 'Eyes of the Dragon' which had been on my kids high school summer reading list. i have already lent it to someone else.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|I have watched it 3 times already! A great series, can't wait for the next season.I found it searching on Amazon TV, thank uou!
B0091QSNEE|5.0|My 3-year-old loves this game! He has fun making all of the foods for the animals, and there's a nice variety!
B0010SKUYM|3.0|Rothfuss and Abercrombie are both authors who fall in this category these days for me. And both for the same reason. Rothfuss' debut novel is daring, unique, a distinct take on Epic Fantasy that deserves to be praised. His prose is lucid and yet lyrical. His eye for detail superb. The plot is one you've seen before, but it's done in a way that makes it seem fresh, proving the difference between trope and cliche is how it's delivered. There is nothing cliche about Name of the Wind, even if you've seen it before.<br /><br />So why only three stars? Because quite simply, I can't stand Kvothe. He's arrogant, abrasive, too all-knowing, and comes across as someone who wouldn't give you the time of day if you met him. If the chronicler didn't have one over on him, HE wouldn't get this story either. This is the danger of the 1st Person Narrative. You have to make the reader LIKE the Protagonist. Or the story becomes a trial to read. I don't like him. I don't WANT to know him. I want to see the Academy, be in the places he's gone. Walk the journey. But with anyone but him. In a 3rd person story, with multiple characters, you can get away with this kind of character. Even as a central one. Because all the reader needs is 'one' person to latch onto to buy in. But in a 1st person story, if it isn't the narrator, it isn't going to happen.<br /><br />So this becomes a like it/hate it book. Read a couple chapters. If you decide you like Kvothe. Buy it. You'll love it. If you feel yourself looking at him like I do, then you're probably going to like a lot ABOUT the book. But not like reading it.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|This is one of those series you want to put in your pocket and keep with you. Weird, sorry. The characters are so wonderfully quirky they make me miss living in New York with all my heart. Probably not for everyone, just those of us who fall in love with character-driven story lines, set in NYC, with a bit of murderous mayhem thrown in. Aidan Quinn strikes a perfect note as the police captain who manages to not be Holmes's foil, but his at-a-distance admirer. Probably an incredibly difficult part to play without being either sappy or bland, but he pulls it off. Lucy Liu as the female Dr. Watson takes blending professionalism with friendship to a new level, making her being a woman make total sense. And Jonny Lee Miller carries the show wonderfully. He is the little boy wearing PJ's with built-in feet while being brilliant. I love this series because they so deftly cover what a great job they are doing. AND THE SET IS GORGEOUS.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so addicting and more fun then temple run! It has awesome powerus and definitely is a rated 5 game
0345472322|5.0|This book has been helpful for me as an employer, as a Dad and has been helpful for my children as well.  There are good examples that are relevant to life in general and are able to be generalized through different age groups.  It is thought provoking and can be life changing.
B00DIJ49UW|5.0|I knew going into Pacific Rim that Guillermo del Toro was given free reign to explore his inner \\"Godzilla.\\" Unlike the B level Godzilla franchise, Pacific Rim delivers every bit the punch one expects. While I do not often recommend the 3D, owing to the weak economy, this film should be seen in the best theater with 3D. I have seen both, and the 3D does add an extra kick.<br /><br />The score is sweeping, and classic. While it does lack an extremely distinctive tune, like the Lord of the Rings suite; the music matches the epic. Heart pounding and determined, the score from the trailer and film make one want to fight legions of monstrous creatures, known as Kaiju. Also, The German word \\"Jaeger,\\" is finally known to the masses as \\"Hunter.\\" So, for the bar flies, Enjoy your Jägermeister with exuberance from now on.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book is a thriller ! Once you start reading you cannot stop!!!!<br />I suggest this book for adult readers and young adult readers.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|We love this game. It is similar to temple run. The minions are funny and cute. My kids have fun with this game.
B00CEQ1HQE|5.0|such an awesome doll i should of got 2 one to keep in the box<br />i havent even seen them in the stores yet so glad i got her<br />monster high dolls were there best idea next to barbie
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|Another excellent read by Khaled Housseni - loved this and will re-read it again.  Probably not as good as the Kite Runner which still remains my favourite book of all time however like the two previous books it draws you in right from the start and you can imagine each scene in your head. One of the best authors I've ever read hopefully he brings out many many more books.
B008CPZNL6|4.0|Nice to be able to get to everything, anytime, with news as well. Some times a bot confusing to set up a new book though

B000077VR3|5.0|First off I watched this when I was just 17 and I loved it right away as a wannabe singer myself I found myself attracted to this movie...I watched it came out and then a few years later after I got out of the Army I saw this movie with Romeo and Juliet (Updated version) put together for $5 at Wal-Mart I Had to have it....I watched it over and over again... singing along to the songs and felling sad about the lovely Satine in the end but loving every min of it till the end...My two fave songs turned out to be Roxanne and Your Song... The beautiful Satine also known as the Sparkling Diamond is casted by the talented Nicole Kidman one of my faves she is the best actress in the world I wish I could be just like her... I love her voice... and not to mention Ewan McGregor (Known as Obi-Wan from the new star wars) He has a very remarkable talent.... This keeps me on tip top shape with my voice so I can match these two stars in the singing bis...=) This story is about LOVE!!! As Ewan says in the beginning The greatest thing you'll ever know is just to love and be loved in return!!! This is a great movie I give it a ten stars!!! I just wish there was a better ending!!! Oh by the way Im a female so Im in love with this movie because of the music>.... &lt;3 If you like the movie get the soundtrack 1 don't bother with part two its not as good as the first soundtrack....<br />Jin
B00C0W08XK|5.0|A friend of mine got mentioned on this game.  Am really happy about it being on my Kindle. It will be used a lot.  Love this keeps your mind going.
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|This is a fun little game.  The graphics are very nice, the characters are 3D objects.  The gems, bananas and some of the scenery objects appear to be also.  That's why the game is 77+ megabytes.  The game play is very family friendly, something everyone can enjoy.  It's a logic game, so it does get progressively more difficult.<br /><br />To clear up a few misconceptions in earlier reviews:<br /><br />1. The game is NOT buggy or glitchy.  If people are having issues, it's on their end.  This game runs flawlessly on my Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 tablet.<br /><br />2.  This game doesn't require WIFI or internet connnectivity to play.  It does to download, but not to play.  I played for a while in airplane mode.  I got one brief message about not being able to connect to something (probably Facebook or a leader board) but it didn't even interrupt my playing.<br /><br />3.  It says in the product details that the game is 77+ megabytes.  This information isn't hidden, so don't act surprised.  If you don't have room for it on your device's internal memory, don't download it.  Certainly don't try to get it and then fail and then come here whining about the app.  It's not the app's fault that you don't know how  to check whether or not you have room for it.<br /><br />Bottom line:  This is a fun, somewhat challenging game that can be fun for both children and adults.  It's a solid 4/5 for me, but I gave it an extra star because so many people have given it 1star due to issues that are probably their own fault.
B008MEM24S|3.0|its not a bad app. its just the same concept through out the entire app. not that exciting. wouldn't buy it again.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|I like the show. It is well done. I think I have watched all the seasons. Not sure when the next season starts again. I plan on watching it when it does.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I started watching this series with friends while on vacation and got totally hooked! After seeing Season 1, I watched Season 2 on  Amazon Prime and now watching Season 3. I'm not a big TV person but this series has certainly captured my attention. I can't wait to continue with the series in the fall!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|well first of all I love how it is free. you get to do jumps and barrels and you get a free horse in the game. I own a real horse and it is just like owning a horse. love it
B0089LOG02|5.0|The Orphan Train is a very engaging and well written story about a chapter of American history that I'd never heard of before. Definitely worth the read!
0061928356|4.0|Secret Daughter is well written novel written by an Indian American author Shilpi Gowda, that has a heartbreaking storyline that tugs on one's emotions. Gowda is a great story teller and one can easily get caught up in the story, which at times feels like watching a soap opera.<br /><br />The book highlights cultural differences between India and America using adoption as a central theme. It also takes on social issue of female child foeticide in India contrasting that against the desire of infertile, childless couple to adopt one.  The story explores emotions of motherhood, loss, identity, and love through the experiences of two families--one Indian, one American--and the child that binds them together.<br /><br />The only negative: The plot is good but at times the characters feel weak, like the narrative of Asha's paternal grandmother's stories.  At times it felt like the author was stretching the story more than required just to fill additional pages.<br /><br />A great read for those who enjoy genera of multi cultural writing.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|In the 60's and 70's George Harrison and friends taught us how to have fun.  Now in our 60's and 70's they're teaching us how to grieve.  It's worth remembering that some of the performances that seem \\"muted\\" were done by close friends whose hearts were breaking.  How many of us could get a coherent sentence out in the midst of such loss?  Thanks to George, Eric, Ringo, Paul and their friends.  It's good to feel once again that the deep music of our lives has become audible, however briefly.<br /><br />After 30 years in ministry, I've never been to a better memorial service than this one.

B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Was a great read but was too great of a distance of a read from the previous book.  I was alson upset it wasn't the final book to the story.  It is enough of the series with the same two characters.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Had a lot of fun solving the puzzles. It was challenging but not impossible.<br />The final room was the most difficult..

0812550706|5.0|I like sci-fi. But space fiction is usually something I do not really enjoy - be it movies, books, video games. I have never quite figured this strange dislike, considering I love reading non-fiction science books related to astro-physics (Geek alert!)<br /><br />However, the blurb of the book promised far more than random space travel and its like. As it turned out, Ender's Game touches several themes - survival, war, existentialism without the religious aspects, child psychology, politics and leadership come out strongly. You might be excused if you forget that this book is really a sci-fi story at its core.<br /><br />So the premise is Earth is at war with an alien species. And Earth very quickly needs a commander to lead its troops. There is a program initiated by the military leaders to dig out the most brilliant children and develop them into leaders by the time they are adults. Ender, however, demonstrates all the traits they need at an age of 13. Now, the book starts out when Ender is 6. You remember what kids sound like when they are 6? Some of them are really intelligent. This book gets into the head of a true 6-year-old-prodigy. It's unnerving to go through his chain of thoughts. But at no point did I think of it as outrageous. And anyone who's found himself startled by insightful things a 3 or a 4 or a 8 year old toddler has said to them, will grit his teeth together in acceptance of Ender's worldliness. Because, if you really think about it, logic of a child, which is free of the weight of political correctness, is the purest form of logic and thought that you will find. And to hear conversations in the book which think like that, and then factor in how the world would react to that thought is really thought provoking.<br /><br />Also to note is that fact that Ender Wiggin is not the only brilliant kid in this book. His brother, sister, classmates are all a congregation of the most intelligent children across the world. Yet, they are all as different aschildren, or people, might be. That is brilliant characterization.<br /><br />The book is largely about Ender's preparation for the war - a set of classroom coaching, war simulation games, battle room fights and all the interactions in between. This of course leads to a conclusion - a very satisfying one at that. And it sets up a very strong base for the rest of the stories in the this series. The whole journey of Ender Wiggin is a very intense ride. It really leaves no room for the author to indulge in literary inanities. There are no redundant, descriptive pages to \\"build\\" an atmosphere for the characters to play a part in. That atmosphere is simply there for the whole of the book.<br /><br />Coming back to the title of the title of the review - I really see no way in which this can be adapted to a successful screenplay. And given the propensity of film makers to making sci-fi movies with more explosions and action than actual story - I am concerned about the level of dumbing down this book will suffer. Worse than a forgetful movie, however, will be a commercially successful movie that totally twists and perverts the characters in this book.<br /><br />Well, here's hoping for the best.
B005UKJX4E|5.0|Great movie, it's a mist see, although not for everyone. Critics either find it one of the best movies others the worst, so average reviews put it as average, which is completely wrong.

B002PQ7JQK|5.0|I grew up watching this classic show like many. I have fond memories of my brother and sisters watching this together and I bought the model kit that featured all the phasers, tricorder too, In fact I think i bought it twice as a kid and used to pretend I was traveling to distant planets in my imagination.<br /><br />The transfers are good and the added enhancements can be toggled off. I personally see no value it the newer graphics at all. My only complaint is that unless I'm blind and can't figure out the main menu, there is apparently no ability to PLAY ALL? i just want to pop in the discs and watch all the episodes per disc in a row and I can't do that?
B0051ANPZQ|4.0|I enjoyed this book but at some parts it was so sad I cried and could not stop. Other than that I found that this book was perfect for me and I'm only12.
B003VS0CYC|5.0|This is a fun series of movies with only the last film being a major let down because the original lead character is different. If you like Robocop this is a must have and one can only imagine there will be yet another reboot.

0312427999|5.0|\\"Shock Doctrine\\" is a voluminously sourced catalog of the dastardly deeds the U.S. military-industrial-capitalist complex commits worldwide. I thought I was pretty hardened to the reality of our nefarious influence around the world but this book offered many new things to be appalled about. Financial and military hegemony are the prime directives, and anyone or anything that gets in the way are ruthlessly rooted out. Spreading torture, promoting dictators and military coups, exploiting natural disasters, quashing dissent, and dispossessing millions to advance corporate and military domination make the pledge \\"with liberty and justice for all\\" a perverse joke.<br /><br />This is a very dense book, full of almost mind-numbing detail. It took me several weeks to read thoroughly. I began with some skepticism. The first chapter's focus on a Montreal woman who survived CIA-sponsored electroshock and torture techniques left me adrift for awhile. It seemed like a stretch in terms of connecting it to Klein's larger metaphor and thesis about \\"shock doctrine,\\" but as I plowed on its relevance became clear.<br /><br />I was most impressed at the vast number and variety of sources the author cites (the Notes cover 60 pages in small print in the hardcover). Many of these sources are government cables, military orders, U.S. torture manuals and corporate correspondence, all of which provide vivid evidence of American collusion in brutality, deceit, corruption and injustice. Reading again about the malicious steps our government took to overthrow Chile's democratically elected president in 1973, ushering in decades of dictatorship, renewed my fury and shame. Chile's tragedy is just one tale in this long, sordid history. Read it and weep.
B008GJV4F2|5.0|A movie that requires attention; like unwrapping individually wrapped chocolates.  Also very satisfying as I watched the main characters being developed and woven into this magical story.  This is not a &#34;romance,&#34; it is about intolerance and how it affects the people and the community.
0399162097|5.0|Karen Joy Fowler has shared a wonderful, deep, thought-provoking story with We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves.  I finished a week ago but I still am thinking about and envisioning the characters as I go about my days.  This story lingers with you.  On the surface it's a novel idea, something creative to share and construct a plot about (sorry for the general description but it's hard to review this book without spoilers!).  But Fowler goes much deeper into love, relationships, family dynamics.  The main plot point is just a catalyst for the deeper story.  The family dynamics and struggles are probably not that different than many, there is a story here that resonates for many reasons.  The narrator and narration is honest and refreshing.
B008Q0AJA2|5.0|This was a great movie when it was made, and watching it again years later, I found it even more compelling because our 24/7 media madness has caught up with the movie concept.  Layers and layers of voyeurism in the movie, and the same in our own lives, every time we tune in to the &#34;news.&#34;
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|lots of fun to play great sound effects I enjoy the graphics all in all a rather fun game to waste time too
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I liked the story but the names were a bit confusing and trying to remember who was who<br />was disturbing!
B00821OX98|4.0|A great action show, with a touch of moral situations that make you think, \\"what would I do?\\". Great show.
B006GECE9Y|4.0|don't really notice any differences, but it is a cool name and icon.  I wish I could figure out how to actually close the application
B008JFUR10|5.0|Ok guys, seriously, this movie is incredible, intense, insane, and just SO. MUCH. FUN. I have never left a theater feeling this physically exhausted. I had to constantly take deep breaths. Let me try to explain the Greatest B-Movie Ever Made:<br />(SPOILERS AHOY!)<br />So there's these giant monsters, the Kaiju. \\"Kaiju\\" is Japanese for \\"strange creature,\\" or so I heard. They're spawning every so often from the Pacific Ocean. After the first one takes out half of San Francisco (by attacking the Golden Gate Bridge first), the U.N. gets together and says \\"HAI GUIZE, LETS MAEK GAINT ROBOTS\\" so they build these 500-foot tall guys called Jaegers (German for \\"Hunters\\"). AND THEY ARE AWESOME. They're stationed in Alaska, Hong Kong, Honlulu and other places around the ... PACIFIC RIM. Within a couple of years, the robots (sorry, JAEGERS) are easily defeating the monsters, and the Jaeger co-pilots are treated as superheroes.<br />BUT then the two greatest pilots come across one near Alaska that rips through the robot, eating one of the pilots, forcing his co-pilot BROTHER (now referred to as HeroGuy) out of comission. I forgot something: In order to pilot a Jaeger, you have to be DRIFT COMPATIBLE(TM) with someone. That's because the robots are too intense for one person to pilot. The program uses some sort of mind-melding thing called DRIFTING to link the brains and movements. Person 1 controls the right side, person 2 the left, and they treadmill along while fighting the Kaiju.<br />A couple years after his brother died, HeroGuy is building a WALL to protect people from the Kaiju (SPOILER ALERT: it's not gonna work) when Captain Chief comes down and tells HeroGuy to come with him to Hong Kong for one last stand. It's in Hong Kong where we meet Dr. Charlie Day, the real human star of the show.<br />Dr. Charlie Day is trying to get inside the brain of a Kaiju while his buddy Dr. Britishpants is trying to use math to predict the next attacks. We also meet Japanese girl Mori (Moki? maybe it was Moki. Not sure) who HeroGuy can tell RIGHT AWAY is going to make an excellent pilot. One problem: Her mind is not strong enough because when she was about 7 she was chased by Kaiju that was eventually killed by..... CAPTAIN CHIEF. Captain Chief has since refused to give her proper training to make her a pilot because she can't get that day out of her head. HeroGuy demands that she be his co-pilot, but after she nearly destroys THE WHOLE FRIGGIN JAEGER PLANT DURING HER TEST RUN Captain Chief says no.<br />Fast-forwarding now, there are some awesome fights, Dr. Charlie Day is sent to meet blonde Ron Pearlman who runs the underground dead-Kaiju body-part trade (favorite line: \\"A cubic meter of Kaiju crap could fertilize a whole field\\") because Dr. Day wants to DRIFT with a Kaiju, a couple of other Jaeger crews are destroyed because the Kaiju are evolving and are now Stage 4, and we come to THE GRAND FINALE.<br />The pathetic weak humans plan to drop a nuke in to the middle of the Earth under the Pacific Ocean because WHY NOT? EXPLOSIONS! So, HeroGuy teams up with Mori in Gipsy Danger(TM) while Captain Chief teams up with Admiral ForgettableDude in the only other robot left. Maybe it was called Striker. I'm not sure. They swim down to the ocean floor because WHY NOT? and it's there that they encounter... oh my God... a STAGE FIVE KAIJU. They know it's Stage 5 because they still have perfect radio communications with base in Hong Kong even though they ARE ON THE OCEAN FLOOR. Fight, fight, pew, pew, bang boom zap, and the world is saved. Dr. Charlie Day was right, because he is awesome. HeroGuy and Mori live happily ever after.<br />Now, as to why I was exhausted: Look, maybe it's the IMAX or maybe it comes across the same in a normal theater, but this is the most immersive move I've been to in a long time. I haven't had this much fun since The Avengers, sorry, MARVEL'S THE AVENGERS(tm). My heart was POUNDING during the very first fight. The 3D effect ishardly noticeable. But the visuals and sound and pacing are just spectacular. This is the very definition of a Summer Blockbuster. If you have any interest in fun, go see this movie right now.<br />I score it 10 out of 10 gigantic swords.hardly noticeable. But the visuals and sound and pacing are just spectacular.

B008ADSDHQ|5.0|It was great to see Harry earlier in his career - to better understand the darkness he carries with him.  He will always have that human, fragile side that makes him so endearing.  I guess it is true, ladies always want to fix what is broken, and Harry is soooo broken.  Loved it - cannot wait for The Cockroaches, and The Police [first and latest] in this series.  Long Live HARRY HOLE.
B007BWUIHA|5.0|Great item and fast shipping thank you very much
B005EGXSWW|5.0|This is another great Harry Hole story.  However, you have to read the previous books to understand the complex relationships in Harry's life.  As a stand alone book it is good - as the 7th [I think] in the series it is great.  Lots of speculation and &#34;wow, did not see that coming&#34; moments.  Just as good in the second reading.

It was also interesting to see Malcolm from Rebus' perspective - having read the books on him.  Eagerly anticipating the next Rebus novel out this fall.  Thanks Ian for giving him a bit more life.

B000JMKTLO|2.0|I paid full price for this kindle book, based on good reviews, and wish I could get a refund.  It was very disturbing.  The review says \\"a hypochondriac mother\\" - wrong diagnosis!  These are really sick people, and everything is written about as though it is commonplace. Could not relate to any of the characters.  I pretty much knew the ending early on but kept reading, hoping for some positive note somewhere.  That didn't happen. I don't mind reading dark material, but this book left me with a scowl inside.  I will not recommend this book for general reading.  The author may be a talented writer, but not sure I will read any more of her books.

B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Oh Man..I am only on the second room but this game is the best. It's one long puzzle and you sure feel great when you figure it out. I recommend this for anyone who wants a good brainteaser.  UPDATE- It's a great price but was surprised there are only two rooms. I certainly will buy any and all games that are like this one.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|Just like when you read too many positive reviews for a movie before you see it, this novel has been the subject of high praise and so my expectations may have created too much weight for the work to bear.  I thought it was imaginative and fun but not a great, hard to put down kind of book.  Good fun summer read but cannot give it my highest recommendation.

B0064X7FVE|3.0|It's still a handy app, but I'm not crazy about the changes they recently made. They should go back to the previous one before the current one.

B000PMG16U|5.0|I've always been a fan of the Star Wars franchise, so I really enjoyed these. I forgot how cheesey and unexcited the first episode is, but overall still a great buy.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I'm 73, yet I know all my grand kids would love this.  What I loved the most from this remarkable book was the imaginative vision the author had.  It stretched my imagination every which way as the story evolved.  Who could think up such a world?  Many book reviews say a book is hard to put down.  Few in my years of reading have been so compelling.  This one caused serious sleep deprivation because I really didn't want to put it down.  Finally my curious and patient husband can have his turn.  I will follow your writing for sure.
B0002TJGQS|5.0|This was a great package deal for Maxell batteries. Currently using the batteries in remotes and in the bathroom scale. I don't have any problem with the batteries and they have been working for over 6 months now. Would definitely buy this again.
B009YU62H2|5.0|This album rocks all the way through. Soundgarden has always been one of my favorite bands and they did not disappoint with this. It's not as crazy, hard, or loud as Badmotorfinger or Louder Than Love but fits closer to their Superunknown sounds. Even then, I'd say it's more refined but not as soft as Down on the Upside. This album brings everything that's great about Soundgarden into the 21st century and I can't recommend an album more emphatically than this one. My favorites from the album include 'Worse Dreams', 'Bones of Birds', and 'By Crooked Steps' but there's not a bad song here.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|The Good Wife has a little family, legal action, and is well cast. It keeps you guessing to the end.
B000S5C6BI|5.0|While Surfer Rosa is probably their most 'well-known' and Doolittle regarded as one of their best pieces, I find Bossanova to keep up with both of those albums in nearly every way. Cecilia Ann is a fun instrumental that always gets my hyped up, Rock Music is a hard-rocking and energetic screamer, Velouria is a classic made known by Weezer, Is She Weird is a fun song, but my favorite part of the album are the melodies wrapped up in the songs Alison, Havalina, Stormy Weather, and Down to the Well.<br /><br />This album is cleaner and more produced than their prior albums, which might make it a better stepping stone for someone new to the Pixies, but doesn't make it any less of an awesome Pixies album than the others.
B007BVMVDU|5.0|Game of thrones is a good film rendition of the books.  That being said, this series is not for the faint of heart.  Great series.
B004HX0P2Y|5.0|If you enjoy action movies for the sake of being an action movie that doesn't ever take itself seriously but is still a good movie then this is for you. Bruce Willis is a retired CIA agent that is ripping up his pension checks for an excuse to chat with a woman at the department when he's visited by a hit squad. From there, the old guy surprises his flirtatious friend before meeting up with his other retired buddies and they proceed to just do tons of silly, ridiculous and awesome stuff.

B00005UKKF|5.0|Last time I saw her in concert was in early november 2001 during her 3rd album came out that week.<br />2 weeks before doing the special for HBO. This concert is exactly just as I remember it.<br />Just not in las vegas , there moments with the troops and on have it aired on cable tv.<br />Still one of best shows Britney has ever done.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Never heard of this show until recently. Wow! So glad I don't have to wait each week for an episode. The writing and characters are amazing. Love, love the humor, especially Maggie Smith. Can't wait for season four.
B0084I9QIW|4.0|Great concert on dvd but I would be happy if they released it as cd / dvd set instead.<br />Minus one star for that sony! Its so timeless and also way overdue finally putting this out.<br />Nice way to celebrate bad 25 with this amazing show.
B006N0YWGY|4.0|Kind of a fun &#34;pick it up while waiting&#34; type game. As others have mentioned, it would be SO NICE if the developer would add speed control to the game. Too often, you are unable to steer the fast boat to obtain the various goals along the way.<br />I enjoy it, and am not deleting it.
B005EHQGTS|1.0|On my Asus Transformer Infinity the app works fine until I connect to my PC. At that point the app disappears. The regular Splashtop App works fine, but I would like the HD version to work.
B00821OX98|5.0|Always a fan of dystopic portrayals; man vs calamity.  'Falling Skies' serves the dish just right with a great balance of story and action if your imagination will allow.  Graphically it can be tacky, but let's face it, we aren't going to see the kind of big screen effects budget without the show going 'Terra Nova.'  Definitely great fun to follow.  Hope you enjoy it as much as I do.
B00AWJYJVA|4.0|Harpers Magazine had a teaser in some of the Spring 2013 issues. After reading the first chapter from the magazine I had to buy this book, and it was as good as le Carré books always are.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this game. I did not have any problems with this app. I like how challenging this game is.
B0054SMID0|4.0|This movie seemed to be like many others with a lawyer, Matthew McConaughey, defebding scumbag clients. When a wealthy man is accused of assault and seeks him out to defend him, the story gets really good.
B007SGM084|5.0|When I started the trilogy I was expecting one thing...<br />What it turned out to be was a well written, endearing story that I truly loved. This was a great birthday present from my husband!!
B00BNGFGIQ|4.0|\\"Chimpact\\" is an enjoyable app full of simply delightful monkey business. :)  The graphics are incredible and very colorful, and the jungle is simply a huge playground.  The sling action is fun, and the player can see the path of the previous attempt so that adjustments can be made more easily.  The monkey rolls up into a ball when he falls, and stays curled up until he lands safely, so there isn't a lot of violence or death in this game.<br /><br />Jumping and sailing through the air as my monkey climbs higher and higher in the trees, and picking up bananas along the way, tickles my funny bone.  Picking up gems and racing against alarm clocks, etc., are somewhat strange goals that don't seem to fit in with the jungle theme, but they provided a challenge and helped to keep my monkey from falling asleep.<br /><br />The default settings on the music and sounds are too loud.  However, they are adjustable, and the music volume can be adjusted separately from the other sound effects, which was a nice touch.
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|It kept me hooked, as all Jodi Picoult books do. Well I highly recommend this book. Well Done an WELL written.
B004ZRV3AU|5.0|I love it, and am cutting sooo many bottles for art projects. it was a great buy, thank you for the quick shipping too!
0307346609|5.0|I hear they're making this into a movie. That's going to be difficult, since WWZ is a collection of human interest stories loosely tied together by a pretty impressive zombie apocalypse. It's a great read, but I can't see it translating well to the big screen. This is definitely one of those you'll want to read before you see the film.
B004V71CYQ|4.0|Great movie to bring back memories. I hadn't seen it since about 1987, so it was fun to see again with actual knowledge of computers and programming.<br /><br />With that being said - my wife who had never seen it before was unimpressed. Look at it as a movie to watch, it leaves a bit to be desired.
0375703764|5.0|Other people have put a lot of time and effort into decoding, explaining and exploring House of Leaves, and I'll leave it to them. This is like nothing else I've ever read.  It's not a book everyone will enjoy... it's arguably not even a book (it occasionally feels more like performance art than literature). But it's definitely an experience I think people should try, especially if they're prone to fits of philosophy and enjoy arguing about archetypes and monomyths.<br /><br />Get a color edition if you can - not that it makes any more sense but the colors add another layer of &#34;meaning&#34; to the text.
B00821OX98|5.0|Noah Wylie is at his best in this show, in fact all the main actors on the show are just fantastic.. Awesome storyline with constant suspense. Really great cinematography.  Anyone with the slightest interest in any kind of Sci-Fi will love this show. If you are just beginning to watch this series be sure to start with Season 1 to get the most out of it.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love this app!  Play it on my kindle fire hd and it works great!!  Graphics are clear and the sound of the cards shuffling sounds so real!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I can't wait to see what happens next!<br />Gideon and Eva have so much going on, I want to see them happy.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|A pretty good thriller, although I didn't care much for the format. It's a series of interviews with survivors of the conflict. The amount of detail the author presented and his understanding of the way the military, politicians and individuals respond to crisis situations made it feel very real. He must have done a lot of research. The book explores the response of cities and countries around the globe to the rising of the dead.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|Grabbed me right from the start, I cant wait for season 4. The lives of the family and staff and the way things were in the era are so cool to watch. The pomp and circumstance is so evident, the struggles to change.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Would have like a little more explanation on the different functions of the game, but is super fun once I figured it all out.
B00BNGFGIQ|1.0|Something is not right here.<br /><br />It says no permissions, but after I downloaded it I put my phone in airplane mode and tried to play. After 4 seconds it stopped and said something was wrong and to re-download the game.<br /><br />I checked the play store and here's what I found:<br /><br />The play store game is on version 1.6 and it's only 48MB<br /><br />The amazon one is on version 1.4 and it's 77.9MB<br />So their lying about no permissions! Plus on the home screen of the game they have  twitter and Facebook icons so obviously they need internet connections!<br /><br />So try for yourself..<br />Turn off your Wi-Fi or internet connection and try and play the game and see what happens.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really enjoyed learning how to work through these room-riddles. My only complaint is that there are too few of them!
0307476464|5.0|This was my 3rd Murakami, and though I didn't like it quite as much as The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle, 1Q84 kept me locked in and wanting to pick it up as often as possible. The fact that a 1,157 page book (my edition) could keep me riveted throughout is the primary reason I decided to give it 5 stars instead of 4, as I did feel it had its share of holes, repetitiveness, and eventual predictability. In other words, in spite of the 5 star ranking I'm giving it, I can understand why other reviewers were frustrated by it, especially in comparison to some of his shorter works. But I was literally pretending I had to use the bathroom at times just so I could sit on the seat and finish a chapter, and I don't think it would be fair for me to give it any less than 5 stars when it had me doing stuff like that.<br /><br />What impressed me most about 1Q84 was the book within the book, Air Chrysalis, everything from its mysterious first draft author, Fuka-Eri, to its eventual involvement in the lives of Tengo, Aomame, Komatsu, and even ancillary characters like Kumi Adachi. The way in which Murakami tells the story of Air Chrysalis and intertwines it with that of 1Q84 is masterful, even if I still have no idea of what exactly the Little People represent. Even Murakami's discussion of the critical response to Air Chrysalis was interesting to me - it seemed as if he was defending what he thought might be the response of Japanese critics to 1Q84 itself (or perhaps, since 1Q84 was released as a trilogy in Japan, he was responding to what critics wrote and said about part I, I don't know).<br /><br />One of my favorite quotes comes from the thoughts of Ushikawa, the slovenly sleuth of misshapen head fame: \\"Nobody's easier to fool ... than the person who is convinced that he is right.\\" (p 793)<br /><br />Another comes from Aomame's thoughts: \\"When granted hope, a person uses it as fuel, as a guidepost to life. It is impossible to live without hope.\\" (p 800)<br /><br />Considering the amount of deception employed by Ushikawa and others throughout the novel, I love the first quote above for its applicability to multiple scenarios. In fact, it could be argued that Ushikawa's fate stems from his own stubbornness, so his thoughts above serve as a kind of warning he should've heeded himself. We can compare Ushikawa to Tengo, who is rarely, if ever, convinced that he's entirely right, and then compare their fates and see that Murakami's characters' destinies are consistent with this Ushikawa quote.<br /><br />Turning to the Aomame quote above, hope is what kept me reading for all 1,157 pages: hope that Murakami would treat Tengo and Aomame fairly in the end. And I think, as Aomame did above, that hope keeps most of us going in this world on a daily basis.<br /><br />For all of the impossibility of this 1Q84 world Murakami's created, the book, to me, is just a big, fat, hyperbolic romantic novel. A love story. Tengo and Aomame experience a lot apart from one another and struggle to find themselves and find each other, and they're both less than perfect people. The question that presents itself by the end is whether they could've been together at a younger age, whether they both wasted a lot of time. It's nothing like Love in the Time of Cholera, no, not nearly that long, and I'm sure most readers will be left thinking that Tengo and Aomame's stories couldn't have gone any other way, that they needed their adventures with the Little People and Komatsu and Tamaru and the dowager and everyone else to become who they are by the book's end.<br /><br />I'll be reading more from Murakami. I've never read any author who blends the surreal and the real quite like he does.ount of deception employed by Ushikawa and others throughout the novel, I love the first quote above for its applicability to multiple scenarios.

B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Game play fanciful; characters interesting; tests your ingenuity. Enough additions to town settlement to choose from.  Just need patience to expand.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|This movie is truly one for all ages.  Steve Carell is absolutely amazing!  There are so many &#34;little&#34; things that are going on that one would think the movie would become confusing but they all are masterfully intertwined to create a true masterpiece.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is cute yes its probably similar to other games but its despicable me and it keeps my kids busy when they are not reading or doing puzzles or watching mickey mouse!
0316069884|5.0|This was an excellent, thought provoking book on the issue of eating animals, factory farms, and its alternatives.  What I especially appreciated was the author's attempts to challenge his readers into taking an active position on the issue of eating meat or at least, eating meats produced by a factory farm--his point being that silence would serve to signal support for the factory farm system.  I also appreciated the author's discussions on the importance and value of communal eating--breaking bread with others--and the author's personal recollections on the meaning and importance of food, particularly as it related to his grandmother. At times (which describing the horrors of industrial farming) the book was difficult to read (I admit to skipping a few pages in the slaughterhouse), but nonetheless, I feel it is an ethical duty of any human being to understand the suffering that potentially flows from the food decisions that we all make every day.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Love to play this game. Great for horse lovers, children and adults alike. I am very pleased with this game.
B004SIP71M|5.0|I ordered this movie in 2011, and have watched it at least 4 times a year. Awesome acting, and story. Love the symbolism especially; this movie leaves the viewer sometimes choosing a side. However it left me in complete doubt which I believe is the point! Highly recommend this movie!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I don't want the story to end!!!! I feel in love with the entire story. I laughed, cried, was mad as he'll. This is the ultimate tragic love story.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|I love this on my kindle fire. Very easy to use and no technical problems, issues, or bugs so far.
B005K0HDGE|3.0|If only...but the consequences are dire. The book makes you think of what might have happened if things could have been changed. I enjoyed the suspense. It was free. Worth it.
B00CL50LEC|4.0|I had never read the book before I purchased this movie but desided to buy it anyway. Was not sure what to expect with a zombie movie (seeing as how I have never seen one or had a desire to see one before) but was pleasantly surprised. Although I wish there was more to the actual movie it was still pretty good. The actor that played the lead zombie male (sorry I do not know his name) did a good job.
B00AXVIHBU|5.0|The characters ring true, without traces of unbelievable aspects or scenarios of their lives. I am drawn into their world, finding myself wanting more and anxious for the next season. I revel their moments of happiness, understand their frustrations, and feel the pain of their losses. I have enjoyed each season and look forward to many more to come.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Great movie...very funny and quite touching! It was good for kids and adults! Worth watching a second time! Must see!
B0063IH60K|4.0|I like this app a lot, in spite of the annoying ads.  Not liking to pay for apps, I'll deal with it though.  :)

B00BEPVAV8|4.0|It is very fun but I am not a fan of the time that makes it down to 4 stars not 5 to me, but is a very fun and a good challenge :)

1442359315|5.0|I purchased both the Audio CD's and Book about a month after my husband passed away from battling heart disease for over 30 years. I wanted the family to be introduced to a more substantial look at the near death experience and since Eben Alexander was a neurosurgeon, from a scientist's background, I found that his views might be the best of the best.<br /><br />In 1974, I myself had a near death experience which was very powerful and very spiritual, which I have detailed in my personal website.<br />[...]<br /><br />Like Eben Alexander, following my own NDE, I started reading everything I could find on this very mystical experience.  In 1975 our family purchased an already existing Christian Book Shop which was in the Catholic tradition.  Our clientele was very progressive and I was introduced to many authors and was able to search out and get more comfortable with my own experiences.  I will give you a listing at the end of my review.<br /><br />Dr. Alexander early in his book gives us the most important message of his experience.  That we are all loved unconditionally.  This is very hard for him to put into words and also very hard for most of us to accept.  Not many of us have had the opportunity to experience this overwhelming love that seeps deeply into one's soul.  This is why it is almost impossible to put into words, it loses it's potency.  Thomas Aquinas on his death bed experienced the beatific vision (God/Om).  He told his contemporaries that all that he had written before this vision was all straw. (Summa Theologiae).<br /><br />Dr. Alexander, being a scientist and trying to meld the spiritual in his life was very difficult for him before he experienced his NDE.  After his NDE, trying to explain this to his colleagues.<br /><br />His son Eben IV, suggested that he not read any books until he wrote his own observations.  This was very wise advice.  One does not want to mix other people's, thoughts, beliefs,  experiences with his/hers.  I myself, did the same.<br /><br />But reading we must because this confirms and explains the phenomenon of the experience(s).  From Buddha to Jesus to our contemporaries, we find meaning and the reason for our being,<br /><br />Other books for your consideration:<br /><br />[[ASIN:0809119560 The Other Side of Silence: A Guide to Christian Meditation]] by Morton Kelsey<br />[[ASIN:1564149773 The Way of the Explorer: An Apollo Astronaut's Journey Through the Material and Mystical Worlds, Revised Edition]]  by Edgar D.

B0085YOD1A|5.0|I have two kindled and an android tablet. As someone who travels and is an avid user of devices, I like to know at a glance the charge level and how much time I have left to use the devices.

B000JIN3J8|5.0|Elizabeth Bennett is just as saucy as she should be and certainly has fine eyes.  Mr. And Mrs. Bennett are both irritating and endearing, also as they should be.  I think this is a very accurate and enjoyable portrayal of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice.

1400067936|5.0|In this book Nassim Nicholas Taleb shows us how a person can appear the picture of success but their life path came about from pure randomness not a skill set or great choices. He does not deny that there are people who dramatically increase their odds of success through intelligent decisions and social skills but also points out that much of success is just random. Based on probabilities of 50% if there was a coin flipping contest of 100 people then 50 would be right, of those 50, 25 would then be right twice in a row, then 12 or 13 followed by 6 coin flippers right 4 times in a row, then 3 that were right 5 times and finally maybe 1 right 6 times in a row. This exercise is pure randomness, no skill is involved. Journalists would then write about how this coin flipper used his method to be right 6 times in a row, his thought process and skill set on coin flipping, and they would all be wrong it was just luck the coin flipper has no edge or advantage in future coin flips.<br /><br />The author explains how jobs like a dentist are not as vulnerable to randomness due to the skills that must be resent to perform dentistry while a stock trader's or CEO's success rate is primarily based on random events outside of their own control. Trader's that are naturally bullish and like to buy growth stocks may look like geniuses in a bull market but then have no idea what to do in a plunging bear market taking back all their gains and falling day after day. A CEO may just be at the right company at the right time with his decisions making little impact on the business environment he is in. The closer the person is to the ground level of accomplishing specific tasks the more skill required the farther away form customers and tasks the more levels of protection from actually having to show real skills as others take care of the details while the CEO just makes the big decisions insulated from much of the battleground reality.<br /><br />This is a great book I highly recommend.
B00821OX98|4.0|Really enjoying this series. I am looking forward to watching more episodes when I can find the time, and am glad there are more seasons to watch.

B00CMEQD30|2.0|I'm sorry but the extreme misuse of the semi-colon is driving me absolutely crazy! Too many fragmented sentences, too many grammatical errors and odd random thoughts make this a difficult read.

B007URVZJ6|5.0|As I start to publish books to Kindle, this reference guide helped me get through some of the formatting issues I was having. For the price, it's great; and for the value of the information, also great!
B00A6RCSKC|5.0|Funny, challenging and well made. A MUST for anyone looking for an addicting tablet adventure! Buy it. Don't think about it. Just buy it!
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Funny, smart and always entertaining.  At the end of each one, I can't wait to start the next.  Well scripted, cast and acted.
B009AMANBA|5.0|A friend of mind told me that this was a great movie but very long, so I bought it because I know how I watch movies and being so long I knew that it was not something that I could rent.
B001XUH69Y|5.0|I had seen bits and pieces but never the entire movie before.  Although the technology was primitive the characters and their portrayal by the actors was brilliant.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|The story line keeps you wanting to read more and find out what happens around the next page.  It doesn't disappoint.
B00D6BU8GG|1.0|I liked the others, but this one was ridiculous.  Sequels usually decline in quality since the makers are trying to hit the quick buck and capitalize on the success of the first of the series.  This movie has one good twist in it but otherwise it's a series of explosions.  If you watch the trailer you've seen the movie.
B0046B1KHG|5.0|Wonderful, already have watched it 4 times! Hilarious! Can't wait to see the second one!<br />Thank-you! Had a Great experience!
B003H06TNC|5.0|Ok, this movie was ridiculous as far as people breaking into singing which I don't see too often but is well done and fun to watch.
B005IQZB14|5.0|I'm getting interested in the plot and I can't seem to put the book down. I'll review again when I'm done!!
B008133MDK|5.0|Really enjoyed the first season but I think it has gotten even better in the second. Looking forward to season 3!
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|Well done film for fans of Marvel and The Avengers. The use of the characters from the individual movies adds to the experience. A little tough to follow at times for someone who hasn't seen the other films.
B00DGMVC4C|5.0|Absolutely love this game.It is well worth the money it cost .My husband saw this on my kindle then downloaded it to his .We now are racing around trying to out do each other.Love the challenge games within the game. Thanks can't wait to see what's next
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|this game is fun!! good for a time waster:) the only problem I have had is that sometimes it takes a while for the app to load, that's why I cant give it 5 stars.
B000059HB7|5.0|Looks great after all these years. I don't even know if they could improve on it. I have just an ordinary 720 Plasma, and it looks great.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Ice Age Village is a great game. Both my 8 year old granddaughter and I enjoy playing it. It's fun and keeps her occupied. Love it!!<br /> Keep up the good work..
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I picked up this book because the movie was so well received. I read the whole thing in one night and I really enjoyed the story. Very compelling characters and quick pacing. Would definitely recommend.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|fun and challenging but over too quickly...better than a lot of the others.  would recommend but it will leave you wanting more
B004JN1D2I|5.0|My husband loves these books!:) he wasn't a reader before and now he is a book worm! It is very nice to see him reading and actually enjoying it! I love it:)
B000JMLFLW|5.0|This is easily my favorite book of all time. If anyone enjoys romance and a little intrigue this is a must read.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|But a bit too much tragedy. The death in the last episode of season three seemed contrived to me. Otherwise, the show is very captivating.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this app is great fun for everyone! it is almost the same as temple run but you have cool achievements to accomplish as well as ur playing a cute minion! you can buy costoms for you minion and race them!
B000FC130E|5.0|Gaiman weaves a brilliant tale of the intersection between normality and the fantastic. Great price as well. A must read.
B0002DB0FO|5.0|I enjoyed this series a lot when it was on television and have enjoyed seeing all these episodes over again.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|My husband and I watched the first three seasons back to back; we were hooked.  I can't wait for season 4.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|It was a great price and the movie is super cute.  Although, I may love it more than my 5-year old son.
B004YW4L5K|4.0|Very informative, but it seemed to ramble in places and I was tempted to put it down.  I am glad that I didn't.
1439130833|5.0|It's great learning! I like the positive way of looking at things and the visualization to achieve them,  Highly recommend it.
B00DC7N9NS|5.0|We were hesitant to watch it based on the 3 star review until obe of our children said, \\"that's what they think, but we might think differently\\". He was absolutely right! A great family family movie.
B001GAPC1K|5.0|The real success here is in the bold move of casting an actor over-40 to be a superhero. This takes guts, because no matter how appropriate it is, most studios would have said, &#34;no, change the story and make him younger so we can churn out as many of these babies as we can.&#34; I don't know how he did it, but Favreau got Marvel to get Robert Downey Jr. to play Stark, a sarcastic Lothario with the brain capacity of Einstein. I truly can't think of anyone better suited to the role and he proves it by nailing every single scene. I'm sure there was some ad-libbing, but even if not, his comic delivery and ability to switch on a dime to a sincere seriousness at will shows his masterful craft.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun and keeps me thinking yet isn't frustrating.  Very clever game with fun puzzles to solve.  Lots of fun.  Very enjoyable.
B009P5K4HK|5.0|I love that this music is not overproduced so the sound is more pure. I have had the set for a few weeks and really enjoy playing it. What an honest modern talent, singing out of an old soul.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|This calculator is perfect for mathematical problems. This app is fast to load. I haven't had any problems with it so far. Only had this app approximately 1 week.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Read this twenty years ago. Since the movie is coming out, I decided to read it again. Just simply a great book.
B006WZLCZ4|5.0|I ordered this set to go with the play kitchen from Hape.  It matches perfectly, is durable and well made.  S&P shakers make sounds.  Cute!
B00340ESIS|4.0|I was always interested in film business, how great films are made. How people are moved by some of the best movies, especially Bollywood. While going through all aspects of film making I realize &#34;scriptwriting&#34; is a soul of good movie and decided that's what I am going to do. While searching books on scriptwriting this was the first book came up. Title seemed little out of subject but looking at number and quality of reviews, I decided to go with it. After reading this in one and half month, I can say this book is great, tells you about structure of movies and details of each section of movie. It's my first scriptwriting book though. After reading this book I can say I started analyzing each movie I have seen and started collecting ideas for my own..!!! Hopefully I will have my own one day. To many aspiring ones like me, who do not have any background or formal education of film business, this book is a great start and worth reading.. Good luck..!!!
B00B5AP7NY|5.0|My kids age 7 & 5 love this movie.  They watched it four times this week on a trip.  The mini-figure is a nice bonus.  A must have for the little super hero/Lego fan in your life.  There are a few words (&#34;idiot&#34;) that aren't the best choice for youngers but it creates a good learning opportunity as a parent to talk about appropriate language.  It also reflects violence similar to the Wii game.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|I wasn't sure I would enjoy a book on a NDE. I expected to be indoctrinated into some sort  of dogma. I actually enjoyed it and feel it has added to my life in a beautiful way.
B003Y5H5AQ|5.0|She loves the smurfs, and was thrilled when she opened this Christmas morning.<br />She has watched it numerous times since!
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|I watched the first 45 minutes of movie which was full of bond action up to a certain point,but something was missing in the way of new tech., great acting drama but i fell asleep.
B0097C8XL0|5.0|This is a game for people who like Temple Run, but it's 1000x cuter because it involves adorable penguins! Plus, It's free, so if you want a game to just waste some time with cuteness, this is for you
B001EC2J20|5.0|GREAT MOVIE ... is a classic... must be seen... and the info contained is very useful, if you understand it...
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I loved the last version of this app. Information was clean crisp and easy to find, compared to this jumbled mess on the new version. Information is lost on busy backgrounds and hard to maneuver through. Please bring back the last version. I found some suggestions for an alternative weather app by reading through reviews. I will be checking them out. Though I would rather just have the old version of this app back :(
B000HAB4KS|5.0|GREAT MOVIE ... is a classic... must be seen... and the info contained is very useful, if you understand it...
B0095P31L6|3.0|This is a light entertainment animated movie appropriate for all ages.  We are a retired couple, and we both enjoyed it.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I choose it cause i thought it was interesting, but the info it contains and the way it ps explain is really AWESOME, interesting and entertained.
B003CH9PTU|5.0|I am required to writ e something , so here it is .WOW just a really great story line with wonferful Actors . Nothing more need be said.
B0014C0BMU|5.0|GREAT MOVIE ... is a classic... must be seen... and the info contained is very useful, if you understand it...
B00CL68BK2|5.0|Really did not have any expections  before watching this movie . I was very surprized and pleased that the actors and writters are doing a humorous ,yet touching movie . The Director has done a wonderful job moving the Actor into this story and leting the Audience share in there changes.
B009MYAQK4|5.0|As always pc puts together a group of quotes and positive thoughts to love by- very similar to warrior of the light and the Aa/ na hand books
B008IJTFYW|3.0|Have tried this using my Kindle Fire and it is fun but not all that practical for sleeping.  Can't speak to meditation or yoga, but since it was free it was worth a try.
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|This is a really good game to get. I got it for free app of the day. It is $0.99 but it should be $3.00. Get the app. It is so fun. You will love this game. My sister plays it all the time and then my brother has to play it. It is a great game to get. Little kids will love it also. You must get.
0062059963|5.0|I really enjoyed this second installment, I just refused to put it down. I found myself shaking my head and bashing my head in frustration at the antics America kept pulling, but I couldn't stop reading! I really hope she gets it together in the end and finally decides between those two....
B006X5L6VS|2.0|Product doesn't say you need a gps in your Kindle.  Since Kindle doesn't have that I was very disappointed.  Wish had more info before I bought product
B000SEFCD8|3.0|I really enjoyed the insights of how our actions are interpreted by dogs, and how we can communicate with them better, but after the first few chapters, there was no more useful information This is not a training guide, and not a reference book.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|I love these kind of games but I am kind of particular about them so I really pay attention to reviews before I buy one b/c  I don't want to waste my time or money on a game that will not interest me... in the past I only left a review if I had a major problem with an app but maybe those of us that love these games can get more attention from the developers if we always leave reviews. This app worked well on my kindle fire the story line of the game was o.k at best...the way the game is set up and plays goes smoothly..I don't want to sit down and get stressed out by a game game and this one does not do that. I gave four stars because I have come across across some horrible h.o adventure games lately lately and it was nice to find a &quot;normal&quot;  game in the mix
B005QYKD4I|4.0|Movie could have been better but the quality on Amazon Prime rivals Bluray. Worth a look if your a fan of the series.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Not to much to say it's only a calculator what could be so great about it? But if I have to say something I'll say It comes in handy at times and yeah that's about it!!! Great calculator!!!!!
B005Z271Y6|5.0|This obviously is great because it's Adele.  There are plenty of songs, she sings beautifully, and her comments in between songs is hilarious.  Also, the dvd comes with a music cd of the live performance! I love that, I put it in my car.
B00D6BQPMM|3.0|I didn't think it was possible to make a zombie movie a chick flick. Thought it would be a comedy, but was a weird live story type music.
B00499QUK2|3.0|Of the three episodes, the 1st is ok, the second is really terrible and the third is really pretty good. I would suggest just skipping the second one, watch the third and then move on to season 2, which is awesome!
B000IZ6URY|1.0|One of the most ridiculous movies I've watched. Mad I spent money to watch it. This movie should be used as punishment.
B008133MDK|5.0|This season (unlike season 1) left me waiting for season 3 to be released on Amazon. Very clever twists and exciting drama. Must watch!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Anyone who enjoyed Downton Abbey Season 1 will enjoy Episode 1 of Season 2.  The stage has been set for another adventure with the Crawleys.
B00CQGU9GG|5.0|I will be honest, I never gave ZZ Top their proper due.  Most of my exposure came from radio, where the 80's synthesizer hits ruled.  Now, that is not to say I did not/do not like these songs.  Rather, I looked at them as good background music....something one is indifferent to.  But I have been on a kick picking up a lot of older music I liked but never had bought.  So I saw this box set was up for pre order and on impulse got it.  I am ever so glad I did!  While &#34;La Grange&#34; and &#34;Cheap Sunglasses&#34; should have proven to me what kind of great sound was there I was quite surprised at their oldest offerings.  Truly great blues rock!  I am now a steadfast &#34;early Top&#34; fan.  And this box set got me into this great period for dirt cheap money!  Some may see the packaging as a con.  I don't.  I would rather have this kind of packaging at this price rather than the addition of liner notes and an extra $20.  Let's be honest, in today's internet frenzied world who really needs liner notes?  Need lyrics? They are a Google search away.  Want to know who wrote or produced a song, or similar information.  Google.  I don't think I have ever bought a CD and looked at the liner notes more than once since the year 2000.  If I need that info I just jump on the internet.  Now I will grant one thing.  The cardboard sleeve may not be the best for long term playing, taking it out and putting it in over and over again.  But I load everything into my iTunes player so for me it is not a big deal.  The only reason I still buy CD's is because I am a bit neurotic and like having physical hardcopies just in case (a lesson learned after a hard drive crash that left me re burning my whole collection for 3 weeks straight).  Plus you can find some amazing used CD's in great condition for a fraction of the price of buying the MP3 or as a new CD.  But I digress...<br /><br />Overall it is hard to hold any negatives against this box set.  You get every penny you pay for from it.As others mention it's mastering is spot on (I think too many arm-chair Mac Book users with fancy sound processing programs that are griping about &#34;brickwalling&#34; need to calm down and take a step back).  So it sounds nice and rich.  If you are a new ZZ Top fan you get the first 10 albums for a great price.  If you are an old ZZ Top fan you apparently get a better sounding set of copies (though since I have not heard of any of the &#34;6 pack&#34; &#34;Smoke, Chrome..&#34; and so on I have to take their word for it).  Either way this is a winning combination!
B00BVMXBVG|5.0|I came to the BD version of this series, which aired on BBC America because it was recommended to me as something \\"different\\" with great acting. Well, it's certainly that. I warn you in advance that you won't learn much about the plot from my review because I'm not an advocate of \\"spoilers\\" and - honestly - the best way to approach this series is to go in knowing as little as possible, the way I did.<br /><br />As the first episode (pilot?) appeared on my screen - and I heard the title character's British accent, I thought - since this was a BBC series - it would take place in the UK. But it doesn't (not a spoiler here in my opinion). It takes place in America and the series was produced by a Canadian company, if I'm correct. It's got a science fiction twist to it, but there are no aliens here. I'm not a science fiction fan but this one grabbed me in the first 10 minutes. If you aren't sure if you will want the whole DVD or BD set, and can watch Amazon Instant (I can't because my ISP only offers slow DSL) then I'll suggest you watch the firsr episode on Amazon Instant and see if it doesn't grab you and encourage you to see \\"what happens next?\\".  Then go for the \\"hard copy\\" because you may want to reply a few of the scenes. Also there are the three \\"bonus features\\"  (mostly behind the scenes featurettes and interviews) - which you should not watch until you have watched all the episodes (unless, again, you like \\"spoilers\\")<br /><br />The cast is great - especially lead actress Tatinia Maslany (an actress new to me).<br /><br />You should also know - if reading the reviews of this title on Amazon - that Amazon groups ALL reviews of a show in ALL formats. So if you are looking for a DVD or Bluray you should note the format the reviewe r is referring to and you might want to sort by \\"Newest First\\".<br /><br />If you like something \\"out of the ordinary\\" this series should interest you. It did me.<br /><br />I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.<br /><br />Steve Ramm<br />\\"Anything Phonographic\\"<br />Steve Ramm<br />\\"Anything Phonographic\\"
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I really do love this app. I find myself playing it a lot more than I thought I would. Get this app if you like puzzles that challenge your mind.
B0089PWU2E|5.0|I have a box set on Buddy and most of the albums on CD, but this is a great set six early albums and hits. Some rare tracks with Buddy singing with other artists. The production is great and a must for any Buddy Holly fan even if you have most of his albums. This box set is worth every cent...a must for any collector of early rock or someone who is discovering Buddy for the first time. He was a genius
B00BR4QNJ0|4.0|This is honestly a really great game, however it needs a way to exchange your coins for glu credits so you can buy upgrades and charms when you have maxed out things to buy with coins
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this app it is so fun as a time waster and better than temple run. I cant stop playing
B004SUWR2C|3.0|Uno is just an ok game it could be better... But is still is a food game 8 9 10
B002FOQY2M|4.0|It arrived very quickly and in good condition. The mp3 version of the cd that came with it was nice to have as well.
B0097C8XL0|2.0|This app has malaware that can take you personal information and send it to the persons who made this game this can lead to pop up notifications in your email and in the notification box PLEASE be aware that you might want to download a security app before you get this game!!!!!!!!
B00DGMVJAO|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised. It was very entertaining. Great visual effects. Giants are scary. Adults and kids will enjoy. Good version of old fairy tale.
0345529057|5.0|I was going to order this for Kindle but the paperback price was a better deal.  Can't wait to start reading this series.
081299471X|5.0|This was, for me, one of those cases that after seeing the movie, reading the book was a most. How the characters travel across time and how the grow and develop is intriguing and captivating. the book is not about karma and reincarnation, but you cannot stop going back to that line of thinking. At the end who we are and what we become is in our hands.
B000FC1JAI|5.0|I was quite enjoying Meditations on my new Kindle Paper White -- but then, at about 11% through, instead of moving one page forward, it jumped nearly to the end of the book.  I found my way back to where I was, and after a few more pages, it jumped ahead again to 59%.  This grew tiresome, to say the least.  I tried resetting the Kindle; I deleted the book and re-uploaded.  But it didn't help.<br /><br />The folks at Amazon customer service were very kind and informative -- after some trouble-shooting, we determined that the problem wasn't with the Kindle device, but with this particular book.  Last I heard, Amazon was going to remove this particular edition until they were able to make corrections.<br /><br />So maybe it's fine now; but I thought I'd offer this caution in case it happens to anyone else.  My solution was to get another edition, as much as I was enjoying this one...
B00992CF6W|5.0|this app it the best app eva i love it its so much fun really u hav to get it iys the best app evar
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Took my grandson and we laughed the entire time.  Very clever and I think the Minions stole the show.  So good.
B00BNGFGIQ|2.0|This is a fun app,  but it is also large,  and surprisingly does not support moving to external storage (SD card)  Please add this in the next update.
0792839749|5.0|They don't make them like that anymore. A real double feature with intermission music and exit music, the first part ending in some catastrophe and the second part starting with the same catastrophe that turns upside down into a miracle. But it is a lot more than that.<br /><br />This musical is for children and it has all the characteristics that were considered normal in those days, I mean some forty years ago or so. Music of course, nice songs of course, but also the myth of the car, paid for the Ford Corporation or company, and the perfect family with a boy, a girl and a dog, with a grandfather and an unmarried father and of course a beautiful young lady near by.<br /><br />But the story goes far beyond and during a trip to the beach, the father starts telling a fantastic story that unveils itself as if it were true in the main story. It will be called a dream, it will be called some kind of a tale, fairy tale maybe, and that sounds a lot better than the \\"mise en abyme\\" of the Hollywood effete snobs. And it is a lot better for children who love stories within stories within stories, and in this case there are probably four or five, one inside the other, that come out like Jacks in the box and open up like Russian dollies, some Matryoshka full of surprise and the whole Bulgarian situation to which the children are captured, the grandfather is deported and the father and his young lady friend are baited and attracted is such a Russian dolly with the village and then the castle and in between several layers of prisons, dungeons and underground inescapable labyrinths.<br /><br />At each corner of these tunnels and corridors you have more dangers and dangerous soldiers or wardens than you may even count. It is a country where children are forbidden and when there is one or more, they are captured and deported to some concentration camp where they grow away from the sun and adults till they die.<br /><br />So from pirates we jump to a barbarous king who is a child who has never matured and only wants toys to play with and real soldiers to play war as if they were some tin soldiers. Then the main objective becomes the liberation of the children, of the village and the getting rid of this immature king who should have been institutionalized a long time ago. But in a way, in his own perverse way, he is funny and the tale will catch him up and send him back to real life under the identity of some Wall Street entrepreneur or speculator.<br /><br />We even forget the whole thing is a love story with the two children choosing their future mother and manipulating their father into marrying her. But do they know what they are doing? They seem to live on what was a norm in those days that a son and a daughter could not grow up if they did not have a father and a mother, without forgetting a dog and a house with a garden. And I forgot: they have to be poor at first and become rich in the end.<br /><br />It is definitely a precursor or pioneer of both Indian Jones and Back to the Future, though watching it in our modern world is like going back to the past when the dream was a real dream and the fun of the cinema was not competing with the humdrum never ending fun of TV and of course the even worse virtual bath in which we are soaking if not drowning all the time, the Internet and the Cloud. As for flying in the clouds, this car is sure good, as good at least as the car of the Crazy mad scientist of Back to the Future.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAUhas never matured and only wants toys to play with and real soldiers to play war as if they were some tin soldiers.

B00DJFIMW6|3.0|this app was a great game for the day I was able to play it. on the second day it kept shutting me out. I have this on my iphone and it works great. even called amazon and nothing helped. please fix!!
0064431789|5.0|Hard to remember that the original critics had strong reservations in their reviewing of Sendak's &#34;Where the wild things are&#34;:  it was thought by many to be a terrifying story for small children: the pictures horrible.<br />Then the children seized on it with delight!<br />And so do I:  and every time I give a copy away I have to buy another one....<br />The most reassuring page sees Maurice back where &#34;someone loved him best of all&#34;,  and he finds his supper still hot.
076790382X|3.0|I actually havent finished reading this yet but so far so good.  Its a light funny read for the beach
B007MNV5WU|1.0|this game sucks I got it came out on the same date as COMICON. so I was walking down the rows of booths of cool action figures and collectibles comic books while I was rocking my SWEET forest elf stume (COSTUME for those lame losers who don't attend comicon yearly and don't know the cool comicon slingo) . so as I strutted at exactly 2.0 miles per hour, not 1.9, not 2.1,  2.0!!! he came out of nowhere DONALD his Stume was far superior to mine. everything was getting blurry the room was spinning, Donald was doing his diabolical laugh. but the battle wasn't over for &quot;I HAD MY SATCHEL FILLED WITH A POTIONS&quot;! so as I reached for my smoke bomb potion when suddenly chippy the squirm came fatted on me, ripped my thong, and threw nuts at me. I lost the comicon L.A.R.P. tournament that day..... to Donald. and it was the same day as this lame angry birds space, and although I am a fan of science fiction it had many errors of astro phisics that bother me greatly. so.......uhm ................ LAME!!!
B0012YYZYK|3.0|Although it looks great and what is there sounds great, Someone,I assume Jimmy Page, has made sweeping audio edits throughout the concert, jarringly restructuring some of the guitar work and \\"fixing\\" some of the \\"mistakes.\\" The good thing is that if you are not a dyed-in-the-wool Zeppelin fan--or just a casual one--you may not notice the copious alterations; however, if you've been rocking out to this show for years and know it inside and out, it is hard not to lament the changes when they, in most cases, neuter, or remove altogether, some of the swagger and spontaneity that crept into the original mix.<br /><br />I will keep my VHS, laserdisc, and original DVD release of this film and will retire this blu-ray and its revisionist audio mix to the forgotten dustbins of my garage.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|This app is amazing, I mean before they created a new version which I hate .why I hate it: 1. No refresh button 2. It's definitely hard to work with.But there is something I really enjoyed I can look at the 10 day forecast for the next day and it gives me the hour with the temp. Where you couldn't do that in the old version . So that's why I  gave it 3 stars.
B005MYEPXC|4.0|This movie tied the best of Old Paris with the struggles of a writer a drift without create exchange. Under line the sterility of our world with it demand of time consumption when we are involve with people who care litte for us and less about us. The time leap back in the golden era of Paris when Writers, and painters were forcing a change in the social fabric of life, created new and wonderful ways to view the world. The movie clearly makes you think about what the golden age is and how it will be defined by those who come after us. What life means to the individual as well as the group you align yourself with
B00CRWJ7VC|1.0|Best part of the movie was the trailer - a nice mix of Matrix meets Inception.  First 20 min were so painfully slow, there is no way I could have stomached the entire 3hrs. I had to turn it off!
B00821OX98|5.0|Very enjoyable post alien invasion program. A must see for any Sci-Fi enthusiast. Just got through season 1 & 2, can't wait to begin season 3.
B00CW665VI|4.0|This book is funny, sexy, crude and interesting. I loved having the story told from the perspective of a guy sitting at a bar having a drink with me. It was a conversation-like piece. Drew is conceited, obnoxious, rich and later king a filter! A very funny read that didn't want to put down.
B0053TMP24|5.0|This book is a great continuation of the Percy Jackson series. The new characters are just as intriguing and powerful as all the originals. I would recommend this to anyone that loved the original series.
B005D4YHP2|4.0|Second pair of these I've bought. Great quality, comfort. The first pair lasted a bit more than two years before the stitching in the rear started to become undone. That seems like a reasonable lifespan for a frequently worn sandle.
0375869026|5.0|loved this book on so many levels, it's an easy read, but deep emotionally. Perfect for my ten year old.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Recommended by a friend; well worth the read. I love the way it was written, great verbage and dialogue. Characters are interesting and very likable.
B00BN3DPQ4|4.0|Sure, the premise of this movie is absurd, and it's full of things that just don't make any sense. BUT! Despite all of that, it was a lot of fun. It had just the right amount of humor and tongue-in-cheek lines from Arnold to make it more than enjoyable.
038532653X|4.0|bought the book to read to my science class as part of our unit on change over time/evolution.  Students did enjoy it
B000OIZUW6|2.0|Absolutely unbelievable! Reads like a screen play for a B movie with unbelievable characters and plots. I was very disappointed because some of his recent work has been good.
B00DIMXTBO|5.0|Talk about a story thickening! OUTIN takes on the current state of the world's affairs in a mystical thriller that is a page turner. The second book in the Nathan Ryder series, where past, present, and future collide into an inter dimensional wonderland. A very enjoyable read. The first book in the series, OUTVIEW, is a great set up, but this is a more satisfying adventure. A superb sequel.
B005K17RU0|3.0|Having tried several weather apps, I will give this one some time. Another weather application was excellent and easy to use before it was &#34;updated&#34;. I gave up after trying the new version.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|Love this app, easy to use and very minimalist, awesome app for the note taking purposes. I use this for a variety of tasks while travelling and prepping for travel.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|Thirteen picked up where the original Black Sabbath left off.  Great songs, great lyrics and just strong music that gets your inter power going!
B000HSKUBE|5.0|Ian Richard was a combination of charming and treacherous.  He was an excellent villain to the very end. Supporting cast were  equally talented especially Suzannah Harken.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I loved the storyline. I just found it a little confusing because the story jumped around. Sometimes it took me a few pages into a chapter to figure out how it fit into the story.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|The game makes you think!  The first few levels were pretty straightforward, but it gets tricky!  It is difficult to stop playing as you want to figure out the puzzles!!!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Occasionally there's almost a glitchy jump that stops the game for a few seconds and then continues. Otherwise this game is brilliant. Great way to spend a train journey.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Great book !!!!!!!!!!<br />Never a dull moment,kept you captivated.  I actually felt I was right in dome with each character
B000W7JWUA|5.0|Wonderful game.  Finally opened it up after sitting in the closet for seven years and it has lived up to the hype.  S of C will be a regular on our table.
B00ABLJ5NQ|1.0|What a waste of time and money.  Save yourself some $$$'s and buy something else.  I want my money back :-(
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|These books are not only addictive, but carefully planned out in a way that seems effortless. I like how Katniss isn't a typical hero, but more of like a Dark Knight. I've reread this series twice and can never seem to get enough. If you're looking for a series you'll love years from now the Hunger Games are for you.
B00BDAP66E|4.0|I have 8 Facebook pages that I run, and this app has been a huge help! There were some glitches at first, but they write fixed really quickly! I love this app!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|A challenging game but not too hard where you would get frustrated with it. My 6 year old and I played it together, though I had to help him with it. He still enjoyed playing. I would definitely buy full version of this game.
B004ZRV3AU|3.0|Scored 30 bottles before needing to change blade but the wing nuts used to adjust for height and width of bottle lost ability to be tightened by hand after about 20 bottles. Lost two bottles to uneven scoring  before I realized this was the problem. Used a pliers to help tighten the wing nuts and the uneven scoring problem was solved.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I use this while playing meditation music to fall asleep. It works just fine. I'm satisfied with my purchase. Thanks.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Truly impressive at the depth of descriptions of the characters in the book. The Audio book as a perfect way to understand the entire story.
B0002X314C|5.0|I have not stopped playing this album since I purchased it. Don't skip any songs, the album has such a great flow to it!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I am hooked!!  Need more levels as soon as possible.  Good for relieving stress and the family plays this together. ok
0230757650|5.0|lovely book for a toddler. my daughter likes pressing the animal noises, and lifting the flaps to reveal the animals. would recommend it.
B00138H3OE|5.0|Still some of his very best work. We wore out the vinyl LP and still loveit. Deceptively simple but very moving.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great fun.  The minion antics keep me chuckling.  They are just so cute - hard to resist.  Challenging game play .  only issue I have is thrhakets who get unbelievably high scores who can compet with those types.  If you can overcome disappointment over never being able ( or even remotely possible) to get a high score on the week challenges, this is a great game
B00CM9JL4S|4.0|What is it about almost all of my favorite bands that they feel the need to royally **** their formula? Wait, I'm sorry, let me start at the beginning. Orphaned Land is a Middle-Eastern progressive folk/death metal band - or, at least, they were - that is known for taking an excessive amount of time to release albums. Like, a six to eight year wait per album. However, it's a justified wait, because this time is dedicated into forging an utterly legendary album. Their previous efforts Mabool and The Never Ending Way of ORwarriOR are flawless masterpieces. So naturally, when they're coming out with something after only three years, one might be a little concerned. The likely scenario is they're releasing half-assed, undeveloped material. Still, being this is Orphaned Land we're talking about, I had faith in them. Even when Kobi Farhi announced there wouldn't be growling on All Is One, I wasn't worried. The growls were never a deciding factor of their music, anyway.<br /><br />I believe an album's introductory track should set a mood for the album or show right off what to expect, and \\"All Is One\\" does exactly that. There are two initial things the song shows off: new symphonic textures used to an extent less emphasized in the past, and you'll be hearing these symphonies all over the album. The next is a complete eschewing of the previous Orphaned Land progressive song format.<br /><br />What we're instead exposed to is a simplified groove spiced with aforementioned symphonies (which do the album great justice) and a reliance on slick, catchy folk hooks. We'll be repeatedly treated to variations on this formula through the album - this song is an enjoyable experience and successful at what it does, but within this formula lies the problem. Orphaned Land isn't about to be called the \\"Middle-Eastern Opeth\\" with this album as they have been in the past, because the progressiveness of their music has been radically toned down. One of the things that made their music so great was the journey-like flow of their songs, conjoining a variety of riffs, melodies, and styles without overly relying on one element - and All Is One isn't just over relying, it's out right abusing them at times. There are only two or three songs here I'd dare label as progressive - one of which being \\"Fail,\\" the only song on the album to contain growls and something more reminiscent of their past efforts. The rest have varying levels of progressive tendencies at best and are straight up commercialized folk rock at worst.<br /><br />So with the death metal essentially gone and the progressiveness so drastically reduced, what's left is some really played up Middle-Eastern folk heavily accented by the aforementioned symphonies; these add a certain drama at times, such as in \\"Brother,\\" which works as an open letter from Isaac to Ishmael - there's a humble poignancy when realizing this is being sung by an Israeli. The symphonies and piano are woven together and emphasize the oriental atmosphere, producing a tremendous, sobering, and moving ballad.<br /><br />The folk has been emphasized in other ways as well; most notably the back-to-back \\"foreign\\" songs - that is, sung in Hebrew and Arabic - \\"Shama'im\\" and \\"Ya Benaye,\\" which are borderline boring. Orphaned Land isn't foreign (pun unintended) to the highly oriental use of Hebrew and Arabic languages in their music, but their past albums generally used them as interludes (see: \\"A'salk,\\" \\"Olat Ha'tamid\\") or tastefully interwove it into their songs (see: \\"Disciples of the Sacred Oath II\\") rather than making it such a major element. This wouldn't be a complaint in and of itself were it not for the fact that it sounds, honestly, like a gimmick. I want to say that over in the Middle-East, these songs could be entirely radio friendly.<br /><br />Between these radio friendly \\"oriental\\" songs and the massively reduced progressiveness in most the rest of the songs, this is their most accessible album by a mile, and one gets thefeeling that was the entire intention of this album, especially considering they threw out the concept of a concept album and gave us eleven individual songs pleading for peace in the Middle-East. I will openly admit this isn't entirely a negative, because the songs do have some really catchy hooks that are likely to please the lover of the Oriental folk sound for which they're known (\\"All Is One,\\" \\"The Simple Man\\"). With simplification of music comes simplified enjoyment; while these songs aren't likely to hold up as long, they might strike you as more initially pleasing without requiring a lot of \\"growth.\\" None of the tracks are \\"bad\\" and most are quite good, despite everything.<br /><br />In fact, All Is One is very good to great, and I'm simply more-or-less angry that this album isn't what I wanted out of it. It's full of great songs - \\"Brother\\" and \\"Fail,\\" representing the two polars of the album, standing out the most. \\"Let the Truce Be Known\\" and \\"Our Own Messiah\\" sit in the middle stylistically bringing out the progressive side just a bit more and are excellent, as well as \\"Through Fire and Water\\" employing the highly exotic flair more impressively. The problem is that the album seems undeveloped - most of their great ideas have been watered down by being simplified, forced, or gimmicky. There's wasn't a long enough gestation period, and this means what could've been another legendary entry in their catalog just comes out \\"an enjoyable experience.\\"<br /><br />When a band like Orphaned Land manages to ensnare listeners with a formula that's successfully and groundbreakingly diverse and eclectic, altering this formula at all seems like a foolish move - simplifying it is almost downright ignorant. I wouldn't care about them screwing around so much if they managed to succeed in the end results the way they have in the past, but they didn't. ORwarriOR, which unashamedly sits as my all time favorite album, was significantly longer at 78 minutes, but it's the archetype by which I hold all long albums to. It was incredibly diverse, hitting many different styles and themes, and never once became boring through the entire album. All Is One is shorter, yet less diverse or creative and because of this feels longer than its predecessors. Just once I'd like a band to come out and say, \\"You know, our new album really isn't as good as our previous stuff. We just weren't really feeling it this time. But we have our label on our collective ass to not take another six years releasing an album, so you're stuck with this I guess.\\" I have good enough reason to think this album is a labor of label pressure, and they sure as hell weren't feeling it this time. That said, only Orphaned Land could release an album that feels so rushed yet still sounds better than almost anything else released yet this year. Not like that's saying much though, cause 2013 has sucked so far.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Definitely one of the best movies made from comics I have ever seen. Action packed with a side of comedy... a perfect recipe for a good time.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Very entertaining and well done in keeping with the time period. Love the costumes and the grandure displayed in every scene
0743244257|1.0|I can't for the life of me figure out what this book was.  I've read different theories, but they don't make sense either.  The movie was interesting; Robert Pattinson made it so.  I just can't recommend it.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Season 3 is probably one of the best seasons I've seen on tv in a very long time!  Excitement and intrigue at every turn!
0060537639|5.0|Just the tremendous amount of research that went into this book is reason enough to read it.  After reading it, anyone who refuses to entertain the theory that the Chinese were here early on, would have to be extremely close-minded.
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|I have played many of these types of games and found it too short, some of the hidden objects practically impossible to find, and the zoom is so small, it may as well not even be there. The graphics are nice and the story line okay.
B005LAIISA|2.0|I have all the Ice Age movies but this one fell a good bit short on creativity and originality.  I guess you can only make so many jokes on a subject until it gets to be &#34;old hat&#34;.  This will probably be the last one I buy -
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This book was very enjoyable.  Chris Kyle was an outstanding sailor, SEAL and sniper.  Its hard to put into words.
B001NEK2GE|5.0|This is a great gameboard for playing World of Warcraft. I have just started playing, and this gameboard makes playing easier.
B001OGWY1W|3.0|I'm not a Batman fanatic.  The movie was OK.  I actually didn't mean to rent this thing.  I was trying to rent the newest release.  That makes me a little stupid.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|Good intermission.  Laid out the setting for what is coming  next.  Some great new characters , which all intermingled with where book 3 left off.<br /><br />.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|My kids love the challenge of figuring out the patterns required to win.  They try to beat each other to the answer.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|Read this book to see if it was something my students could read. I'm sure there will be a lot of students requesting this book. (As a caution there are some &#34;words&#34; that scattered throughout the book)  The story itself is very interesting and keeps you engaged in wanting to keep reading!
B0094M4R3Q|5.0|This had a good message.  Was also very funny. My daughter watched at least 4 times and I myself enjoyed it twice.
1878424319|4.0|THIS PRODUCT MORE THAN MET MY EXPECTATIONS AS I AM FAMILIAR WITH THE MATERIAL CONTAIN THEREIN. THE PRICING WAS EXCELLENT.
B0054R6BFM|3.0|This book is definitely meant to be read by 16 year olds or high school teachers who plan on adding this book to their scheduled reading. It does give teens on the brink of adulthood an idea of how seemingly innocent teasing, selfish and thoughtless acts can have profound and devastating effects on their peers. At 16, you're a time bomb, a perfect storm of emotions combined in a glass bottle. However, I did find the story at times to be overly dramatic (when describing the listener's reactions) and the young girl's sarcasm better fitting an adult rather than a sixteen year old. The writing is ordinary, nothing very literary, but it does get the message across. If I were 16, I would love it.
B00CH26TL8|2.0|The graphics are pretty good.  The basic game play is fine, and plays well on my Kindle Fire.  It's a very traditional 'shoot the bubbles out and match existing bubbles' game.  The extra challenges are interesting, with a variety of evil bubbles or challenges to overcome.  The problem is that it is well-nigh impossible to excel on any given level past the first 15-20 without having to spend money to buy their powerups.  You can grind out some 1-star wins with patience, yet only having 5 lives before having to wait some time to try again is tediously unnecessary.  Want more tries?  Pay.  Want powerups to overcome the ridiculously stacked daily challenge for more powerups?  Pay.  Want to be able to do better than a 1-in-100 chance of victory thanks to dumb luck?  Pay.  and pay.  and pay.  I get games with the expectation that with time and effort I can beat them, and beat them to the best degree the designers made the game for.  Having to essentially cheat with powerups and having to pay for the right to use most of those repeatedly isn't a challenge - it's an exercise in bank account balancing.  No thanks.  Deleted.
B0053Q9DHW|4.0|How may versions of Jane Austin and the Bronte sisters have we seen in hopes of finding satisfaction at last?  None more so than Jane Eyre.  A few have come close but, still, no cigar.  I saw this production not expecting much just because of the two-hours or so constriction of modern movies.<br /><br />It starts out well.  I like the flash back approach to a story we all know.  Mia Wasikowska is just right as Jane and Michael Fassbender's Rochester, too, is believable and refreshingly not dour.  I always enjoy seeing Jamie Bell in anything and his dour St. John Rivers is fine.  Add in Dame Judi Dench, a lush Victorian setting and an eerie, mysterious presence in the gothic Thornfield Manor and you should have everything you want in a new Jane Eyre.<br /><br />You can see what went wrong by viewing the deleted scenes, especially two which are critical to the story.  One depository scene explains Adele's presence and the other is the scene in which the madwoman creeps into Jane's bedroom and tears her wedding veil!  The inclusion of those scenes plus extending the very abrupt ending just a little bit would have left me with &#34;wow&#34; instead of &#34;that's it?&#34; and I would have rated it as five stars.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I look forward to checking the weather everyday with just a tap on my kindle, Do not always like what it is but it's there thanks
B000UPSKO8|5.0|Almost every aria and orchestral piece were among my all-time favorites (and eye candy, too).  Concert left me awash with happiness!
B0064X7FVE|1.0|It was very easy and practical to use before the update. Now is confusing and waist of time trying to find the info you need.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|This is my second book from this author and i must tell you: she's a GENIUS!!!!! her characters are so rotten in one way or another that it keeps you guessing about them; the heroine here is not the typical girl that gets the guy and solves the mystery, no this one is just so twisted in every imaginable way...... i wont say more i don't wanna spoil your reading, but buy the book you wont regret it....
B001NLL93W|5.0|This is a great series. Really enjoyed reading it. Great characters and I highly recommend it to others. Very enjoyable.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I enjoy all the patterns of the game and the fact that you can shuffle if you get stuck thanks. If you could change the<br />tiles look to see better and stand out that would be great!
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Really great book. Can't put it down. Love the series. Highly recommend this to anyone looking for a good series to read.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|So fun!! My only complaint is that its too short. I want more levels. It's challenging enough to be fun but its easy enough to be fun and not give up on.  Simply delightful!
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Really great book. Highly recommend this to anyone looking for a good series. Couldn't put it down. Looking forward to the movie coming out this summer.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Really enjoyed the book had me reading every second I could.  Can't wait for the next book!  Would recommend to read to all my friends.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Fab app! wouldn't use any other weather app easy to use and navigate! Keep up the good work accu weather
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Absolutely awesome game. Felt like I was solving the healthiest cube in the movie national treasure. Too short but worth the $2.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I could not put these books down until I finished all three, and I'm not an avid reader!!!  You will not be disappointed in reading the trilogy of these books; I can't wait until the author continues the story in her next set of books in 2014.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Fun, like all the different accents for each country. Don't want to buy bucks, just win them. Keeps me interested.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I have enjoyed watching all 3 seasons of Downton Abbey on Amazon Prime.  It was a great way for a &#34;Yank&#34; like me to get a better understanding of Great Britain in the early 20th century: the rituals, social structure, attention to detail, and of course the drama of a lord opening his castle to wounded soldiers during World War I.  The love stories and women's rights issues kept it entertaining, so much so that I usually watched several episodes at a time, one after another.  Thanks, Amazon!
B009R659L8|4.0|A lot of characters were involved. Would recommend to friends who like Mary Higgins Clark's books. Good for beach reading.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game is the new standard for puzzles.  Anything else would be unsatisfying.  The 3D is great, but so are the new puzzle tricks.
B007SGM084|5.0|It it a very good series and captivating reading.Once I started I couldn't stop.... Kept my interest thru the entire series.
B0052REUW0|5.0|THIS IS AN EXCELLENT BOOK FOR EVERYONE WHO WATCHES TOO MUCH TELEVISION AND HAS THE GENERAL IMPRESSION THAT THINGS ARE BAD AND GETTING WORSE.  THE AUTHOR REVEALS THAT THIS IS NOT AT ALL TRUE AND WE SHOULD FEEL BETTER ABOUT THE STATE OF THE WORLD WE ARE LIVING IN AND THE TIME WE ARE FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO HAVE BEEN BORN.  YOU WILL FEEL MUCH BETTER ABOUT OUR FELLOW MAN AND OUR TIMES AFTER YOU READ THIS BOOK.
B008BQ8VOC|4.0|I never watched an episode as it aired on USA as it just didn't look like something I'd enjoy - and frankly I tend to watch too much tv as it is. However I decided to give the pilot a watch seeing it was available on my Kindle Fire - and that induced a Suits marathon. Couldn't get enough,now anxiously awaiting the third season.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game. I can't wait for more rooms to be added. This game really makes you think. Very addictive. .
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|I got it for my kindle fire and the first time I played it it was awesome then it messed up my kindle and didn't let me play
B003R0MEZ4|5.0|I love Criminal Minds and it's a great season. Now to fill enough words for review. You should know by season six if you like this show.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Enjoyed it while it lasted. Wish there were more levels. Nice graphics with just enough puzzles to keep it interesting. Hope to see more floors soon.
B003VIWO9I|5.0|Yet another entrancing story from Sir Terry Pratchett. It's laugh-out-loud funny, but strong with a story of courage and integrity in the face of hatred and prejudice. AND you get the Feegles in the bargain !
B001EC0OMM|5.0|A fun romp through the social scene -- 3 of the greats -- a great flick. A great way to spend Saturday evening while hubby watched baseball.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|I recommend this book, but one of that kind of book is enough for me, not  a language that I enjoy.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love the series! Watched each episoed with Amazon Prime, and couldn't stop watching till I had seen all 3 seasons! Now I can't wait to see Season 4. Unfortunately the new episodes don't start till January on PBS. I might just have to watch them all over again! Love it and recommend it to others! I am truly a Downton Abbey Fan!!!!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This app is indispensable!!! It is so responsive and easy to use. I have not found that it eats up the battery in my Fire HD. I'm a weather freak and would not be without it. Get it - you need it!
B003UESJHE|5.0|The King's Speech is a wonderful film.  Extremely well acted and beautifully filmed. Sooooooo much better than \\"The Iron Lady\\". I mean, I love Meryl Streep, and she gave a wonderful performance in \\"The Iron Lady\\", but the film itself was awful!!!  You will not be disappointed with \\"The King's Speech\\"!!!
B005PK57IK|5.0|Took my a few shows to get hooked. Michael Fox was surprisingly entertaining throughout. Come on season 4, become free. I can't see paying for these shows as there is so much other content.
B00A9T1HUO|4.0|:<br /><br />Yes another Josh winner, wish he would do more tracks with the Gospel singers though, a great combination. Some tracks sound similar, maybe they will grow in time.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Interesting point of view although he did seem somewhat egotistical at times. It is a difficult subject, if you have not gone through a similar experience, but I know one person who was comforted by the book as she has a love one with a terminal disease.
1452113432|5.0|Clear & beautifully presented book, simple recipes to use as well as more complicated ones, very pleased I bought this to follow the TV series.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|not a new type of game, but bringing new elements and work from a lot of obvious hard work. like the movies, original and fun and especially for a free game very good
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|What a cast of extreme talent. Just one piece I was unhappy with concerning the angry comments to the French member of staff but apart from that, a feel good Movie.
B005544TRQ|4.0|plays on the desire we all feel to be speical in the best ways even when we find ourselves not being the best humanity has to offer.
B00BIVN82M|3.0|Not so good as previous albums from Michael. The final track is the best one for me, the rest I could do without.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|The battery life on the Note 2 is fantastic out of the box. After about 8 months, I'd installed enough CrApps to notice a decrease in battery life. At the end of the day, I'd reach 20% or less regularly. Not at all the case for the first 6 to 7 months. Installed this app and calibrated. First few days, no major difference and I suspected this was more of a reporting tool. A week or so later, I'm starting to see a return to the life it had brand new.  Psychological? Maybe. Download and see. You know your want to.
B00AZNEW5G|3.0|Did not want to miss this & felt the tension & pain all the way through. Well presented & documented.
B005FLX2WC|5.0|Beth hart blows you away with her voice! Joe Bonanassa rocks and some covers but some good originals too;)! Very soulful good music!
B0044IABFS|5.0|Keeps you wondering what's going to happen next. Also keeps your attention the whole time and makes you want more like the AT&T commercial.
B00000DQSV|5.0|I still have the vinyl pressing of this album!  I have no intention of getting rid of the record, I still am grateful that this cd has arrived as it is the way in which I can actually play this particular recording.  Thank you for prompt and efficient service and high quality and good condition in which the cd actually arrived. Thanks a bunch Suzette!
B003L77GRO|5.0|This series gets better and better as the seasons go on.  Michael C. Hall is pure magic in this role.
B00009W8N2|4.0|This is Opeth's debut album and it shows. The songs are sometimes not thought-out well or lack direction, there are awkward pauses occasionally from heavy guitar to acoustic medleys, and for someone who appreciates lo-fi production, the sound is very raw and unpolished.<br /><br />Aside from that though, there is excellent musicianship all around and Mikael is great with his vocals both growling and clean. I can't give this 5 stars because this is Opeth developing their sound and trying to figure out what direction they want to go in. It practically sounds like the blueprint for \\"Morningrise\\".<br /><br />The bonus track on here has terrible production quality and sounds like a straight up hardcore metal song; it's not exactly noteworthy in my opinion.<br /><br />For big Opeth fans, definitely buy this because there is some great music here.<br /><br />For people starting out with Opeth, get either \\"Blackwater Park\\" or \\"Deliverance\\" so you understand the band better and aren't turned off.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|well I really like horses cause my dad had a couple it makes me want to get one myself it's great.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I love temple run 2 because there's many types of new elements added to the game that the first one didn't have so that's really fun and nice to have.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|Loved this book.  Well developed characters and a interesting story = a great book.  I am sorry that I have to find something else to read.  Enjoy!
B00CH26TL8|5.0|I love this game. Each time I think I will try something new, I keep coming back to Bubble Witch! You have to plan your moves carefully so that you can not only burst enough bubbles but also collect stars. So much fun!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This is a fun game.  I only just started it, but I'm having fun.  I like how realistic this game is, graphics wise.
B0016YBFZ8|4.0|You can't beat the combination of Robert Deniro and Joe Pesci. The 3rd star, Ray Liotta also did a great job on this film. I watched this movie through Amazon Instant and quality was just okay, of course the movie is not in HD quality.  This is a classic well worth owning in blu-ray!
B004SUWR2C|3.0|I enjoy playing UNO with I'm together with friends and I live being able to play it on my Kindle.  You can play it by yourself or join others online.
B00821OX98|5.0|A good scifi series. Full of action and adventure. Im curious what will happen in the next season. Cannot wait till the next season.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|Subway suffers is a good game, but some of the challenges are a little too hard. Try making it a little bit harder, and that's when you'll get at least a 4 star review from me.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|Very creative, full of imagination and intrigue! Fun suspenseful live story! A unique love story. While reading this I wanted to be part of the night circus. I wanted to venture into the wishing tree room and add a wish. I wanted to jump around on the clouds. I wanted to be dressed in black and white and have my imaginations come to life...
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Fun similar to temple run with mini games. My daughter loves it. Great buy for the price. :0 :) :D
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|\\"I do not miss childhood, but I do miss the way I took pleasure in small things, even as greater things crumbled. I could not control the world I was in, could not walk away from the things or people or moments that hurt, but I took joy in the things that made me happy.\\"<br />― Neil Gaiman, The Ocean at the End of the Lane<br /><br />This was a well written story by Neil Gainman. I enjoyed the story line, the lessons of life, friendship and monsters. It is truly an adult fairy tale. How do you remember your child hood? Do you think you change things? Do you forget some of the negative and turn it to be more positive, or just easier to deal with?
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|its very cool and creative i plsy all the time!!!!!!!!!!! get it now and u will have so much fun
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I'm an avid fan - Have read all his books.....and happy to say this is more like his older novels..  It's a easy read and going back and forth in time I realize how our world has changed and sorry to say not for the better.  If only the book was fact!  Our President Kennedy would not have been assinated...My grandson is reading it and learning quite a bit about how are world was compared to how it is now.  I highly recommend it for young and old...
0439023521|1.0|This is by Nathan Sterken, not Katherine.<br /><br />How can humans give this satanic crap rave reviews? Do you idiots know that millions upon millions have been forced to do this throughout the history of the world?  And you find this entertaining?  Do you not realize what kind of a monster that makes you, by liking this garbage?  I would pray but the only thing I can pray is that the Lord ends this world ASAP because this race has become so demonic that there is no longer hope for humanity.
B0019IB0II|5.0|Very helpful and useful to a post-stroke patient!! What to look for and how to react to people after the stroke!
B00C33M2EE|3.0|I was disappointed.  Not nearly as good as the first album! I hope they will do other albums with more appeal.
B00A8MGLAI|1.0|This movie was the biggest waste of time I have ever encountered. I recommend not wasting your time on this movie. I would rather watch flies land on dog poop for two hours than watch this. Please take my advice and don't watch this movie. If amazon wouldn't have givin me this movie for free I would demand my money back. I wish I could demand the two hours of my life back that I lost watching this garbage!
0061433063|5.0|Tiffany grows up in this novel, and brings us a few surprises.  First she befriends an old friend of Pratchett readers--no, I won't spoil your fun by telling who it is, but you must remember that Tiffany's already become acquainted with Granny Weatherwax and Nanny Ogg, so it ain't them!  I was delighted by this person's reappearance.<br /><br />Like Nanny, although not THAT interested(!), Tiffany seems too interested in the opposite sex to remain an unmarried witch like Granny Weatherwax, and at the novel's conclusion she may have found a life partner.  There are the expected humorous comments, rural customs, the endless hard work of being a \\"witch\\" (mostly performing as a rural nurse-midwife), help from the Wee Free Men, especially Rob Anybody and the Kelda.  Tiffany's family is no longer central to her--she's grown up now.  The demise of adolescence is marked by her choice to wear black, as the title implies.  No longer bound by rebellion for the sake of it, Tiffany is now able to make her own rational choices.  It all meshes together beautifully, making this the best in a fine 4-book Tiffany \\"miniseries\\" within the Witches series, within the Discworld novels.  That's a nice place to be.  I liked all the Tiffany novels, but I think you will share my opinion of this one.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book.  My dad had an afterlife experience and this went along with what he reported about it.  Well documented and written.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I LOVE this game, even though it's very addictive. My sister's ' play my friends play it and even my friends moms play it! It's awesome.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I gave this game five stars - This is a game that has you thinking, searching and putting clues together-enabling you to<br />proceed to the next level. This game is worth the download. I am waiting for more to come.
B0012HF5NC|5.0|Love this movie.  I watch it every Fourth of July.  It will now be part of my collection of favorites.
B0092S4WLY|5.0|I downloaded this game, played and liked it. Could not put it down until it was finished. Waiting for more floors to come.<br />I like that you have to figure the sequence and solve the puzzle in order to continue. I would recommend this download.
B000063Y8F|5.0|I have strong memories of getting handed the chore of cleaning the garlic press when I was a kid.  We had to use a toothpick to get all of the stuck garlic out of the holes and it was a bear!  Even though I love garlic, I didn't use it much and when I did I opted for a knife over a press.  I didn't even own a press anymore.  Of course, my hands smelled like garlic for 2 days but that was ok because, well, I didn't have to clean a press.<br /><br />Eventually the frequency of chopping garlic (and smelling like garlic) were enough to convince me to look again for a new tool.  I initally looked at this press and thought it would be only serious foodies that would pay this much for a kitchen tool.  But me and my smelly hands kept coming back and the reviews of this tool and of this company convinced me to finally take the plunge several months ago.  Can I say what an idiot I was?  I should have bought this tool a looong time ago.  Pop in the garlic, an easy squeeze, and presto!  Mix into your cooking and get on with it. And, Brain flash!  No toothpicks required for cleaning!  Open it all up and it's easy peasy to clean it with some rinsing and maybe a light wash.  I don't even bother tossing it in the dishwasher.  I'm now a happy and less smelly garlic user.
0345803507|5.0|Finally a read for women! I decided to get the trilogy and not a disappointment! It's been borrowed out and have to hunt down my friend to get them back.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|Big Bang never jumps the shark.  I love how they are able to keep everything so fresh, even after 6 seasons.
0446569895|5.0|Well this book did not disappoint. I received it in the time frame I expected and I just couldn't put it down. Borrowed it out and haven't seen it since, it's been passed around I suppose.
B0011UGLK6|5.0|Outstanding writing and the development of complext characters in each story make this an excellent choice.  The last three stories are intertwined and I couldn't put them down - had to find out what happens.
B0031RS4V6|5.0|A real pageturner! Lee Child delivers as always in this book about Jack Reacher.<br />I look forward to read the next.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game really had me thinking on some of the levels.  I can't wait for the developers to add more levels!
B005LAJ1PE|5.0|Came on time and not a bad price.  Highly recommend.  Great show horror is my favorite so this feeds the need for it and a great story line.
1451627297|5.0|This book kept me wanting more. It was not a typical book about going back in time. You think you know what will happen but then a twist will happen every time. Loved this book. I even bought my dad a copy!
B006LXQID8|1.0|This movie I watched for a few minutes and well, the unexpected plot, strange characters, I was sort of caught off guard. From the start I found the Amelie character, in some ways criminal. I didn't find the movie appealing at all, it was extremely boring and also strange. I even tried to watch a second time just figure out why so much appeal and the same conclusion. Maybe I need to move the time bar way up and watch the porn scenes (excuse me, soft porn scenes).
B006MHWXMS|5.0|Exactly what I was looking for.Glad it was free.Didn't have to pay for it and find I didn't like it. New to kindle Fire and still finding my way around.Downloaded the camera do not know how to use. Thanks Joan
B006BDHAX0|5.0|I have always enjoyed Mahjong and this game has so many levels. You never get tired of playing it. Anyone who orders it will never regret it.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Never thought I would like Downton Abbey but I am hooked. Season was great and cannot wait for season four!
B00DNLXDUW|1.0|By far and away, the worst app I have ever been unfortunate enough to purchase.  It's a regurgitation of the web app, but worse.  Save yourself the 99 cents, but more importantly, save yourself the wasted time of downloading and deleting this garbage.
B00ABLJ5NQ|5.0|I have to admit I'm completely biased for Gaiman's work. I love this man's writing. This book is gorgeous, painful and exquisitely crafted. I loved it.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Loved the way he flows from one tale to the next and how they Alps fit into each other beautifully
B00004XQ83|4.0|This was just what we ordered and I really like it. It was shipped out and everything was alright It's good
B00470TOV0|5.0|Very interesting  and well done. The action never stops and special effects are amazing it's Rome be prepared to see people kill each other with what I call hardware store tools and swords and expect blood no shortage of that.
B0002IU988|4.0|One Day Remains is the first effort by Alter Bridge.  This premier perfomance should have had more &#34;Air Time&#34; by the so called &#34;Rock Stations.&#34;  So many great tacks on this C.D. you will not be disappointed.  Although One Day Remains. was recorded in 2004, it stands side by side with any other great &#34;True Rock&#34; C.D.'s  of its time and now!
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Very funny! I really enjoyed this book & loved Tina's honesty. She is awesome & love her writing so much!
B00957T6X6|5.0|A Song of Ice and Fire is an intricate story in a rich, mid evil world. With a unique narrating style, it is a refreshing read. Never before have I read a story with such realistic characters with believable motivations and interactions! A fantastic read, and highly recommended.
B003U4UPHG|5.0|Love this program, I am trying to watch as much as possible. Characters are really intriguing, and you never know what is coming next.
B002GSXKN8|5.0|I've been looking for one of these sets for a long time, I'm glad I finally found one. I always loved the batman movies.
0670026557|5.0|Yes. Read the sample of \\"Give and Take: A Revolutionary Approach to Success\\" by Adam Grant if you are on Kindle and read the book itself. It is heartening, informative and thought provoking. There are good stories and analysis. You are likely to feel better as you read it and you are likely to learn some strategies for applying in life and work. Grant has done a good job of bringing together research, anecdotes, case studies and what might have been common sense to craft a very readable and valuable book.
B0036EH3U2|5.0|The Silver Box set most definitely has both The Plan and Razor. The Plan is in its own case and Razor is in the case with season 4. The miniseries is also included in the season 1 case. It all comes packaged together in the silver box that you see in the picture.<br /><br />This series is amazing and the picture quality is great on the blu ray. (Side note-  some episodes appear grainy at times, however, the show was filmed this way on purpose to give it an antiquated look).
B0087GJ8KM|5.0|This book uses existing research to prove a point that selling is part of our humanity and reverse the stigma that we have put it on sales. We all now live in a connected world and selling is not necessarily limited to transaction of money and goods, but with ideas and propositions as well to make things better for the world around us.
1401938906|5.0|Just beautiful. Without dogma or tenet.  Fun and easy and joyous. Takes away fear, sadness and allow the reader fun options.
B005I735F2|3.0|For those who might be a little confused, there are two versions of The Essential Electric Light Orchestra. One was a single disc released in 2003 while a two cd version was released in 2011. The Import version of the 2011 has a slightly different cover. The songs picked are good ones but but some are single edits and I have to wonder how many ELO \\"hits\\" packages we need? Both [[ASIN:B0009YNSJW All Over the World: The Very Best of Electric Light Orchestra [ORIGINAL RECORDING REMASTERED]]] and [[ASIN:B001110QHE Very Best of Electric Light Orchestra 2]] were released only a couple of years before this and with [[ASIN:B000002735 Afterglow]], [[ASIN:B000002A2V Strange Magic: The Best of Electric Light Orchestra]] and [[ASIN:B000051XZH Flashback]] already out there (not to mention rip off comps like Burning Bright, ELO Classics and Playlist Plus). The artwork isn't all that great and many are the single edits even though there's leftover room on the disc. There are zero rarities like Matter Of Fact and Buildings Have Eyes. The only plus that this one offers is that I'm Alive and Don't Walk Away from Xanadu are included here. If you're interested in an ELO hits package Strange Magic, All Over The World and Ticket To The Moon are recommended over this.
B00632HWOG|1.0|Yahoo stopped recognizing my mobile devices.  Finally loaded this app to access my email without having to go to the Yahoo page. Hate the format.  No satisfaction from Yahoo to resolve the issue with my mobile devices. Had to correspond with &#34;Mr. Customer Service&#34; who had a difficult time with English reading comprehension.  Ended up opening a Gmail account and ditching Yahoo.  Don't know why I haven't done this years ago.  Thank you Yahoo for your non-existent customer service, without which, I would have perhaps not have discovered email without continual glitches, and pop-up ads advertising &#34;hotties looking for me&#34;, and &#34;testosterone treatments&#34;.<br />If you're looking for an email app, then first find a legitimate email provider and look for their app.  If you're still struggling with Yahoo junk, then go ahead with this app, it won't much matter what you use.  Oh, and one star because ZERO stars wasn't an option.
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|this game is great..the grafics are good and the games are challenging! i highly recommend this game to everyone who loves mahjong!!
B00D2K40WY|1.0|My daughter was so disappointed because you have to buy the full version to pretty much do anything in the app (and also be ad-free).  I'm uninstalling it!
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|It says I need to watch a tutorial to expand.... what tutorial?! Someone fix this, I want to expand. Please
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|We love the rapport between the characters and the feel of the show overall. Highly recommend!  Can't wait for season 3
B0054JZC6E|3.0|It's ok but I have played better games<br />I guess I would like it better if it had more match three
B00CH26TL8|1.0|I can't even get to the game, it keeps taking me to another screen.  Can't figure out how to make this one work.
0156027321|3.0|I kept thinking I should like this book more given all the good things I've heard about it, but it wasn't really my thing. Some of the descriptions were too drawn out, and I didn't like the ambiguous ending. Others loved it, probably because it fuels debate, and for that, I give the author credit. I'm sure it's a great book for book clubs.
0792839749|5.0|this movie is such a classic. I loved watching it as a kid and now my 2 yr old son loves it too! such a wholesome and good family story and movie. dick van dyke is wonderful. I couldnt recommend another movie over this if you're looking for a good family movie.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love this show so much. The details of life back then and the characters are amazing. Wish they wouldn't keep killing off family members though!
B008SGMPVU|1.0|What a piece of crap. This movie looks like someone made it in there garage on a budget of $5.00 or less. Trust me and spend your money on a Big Mac and you will get more satisfaction. I could not stand to watch more than 4 min. of this joke and don't see how someone took the time to make this. At least I put it in the recycle bin so maybe it will reappear as a plastic bag or 6 pack retainer.
B0096HFOZO|4.0|The Twits is a great book. So if you are looking for a quick and fun read, this is the book. It is a silly, but interesting book. I even wrote a book reporet for school on this book.
B005LAIIQC|5.0|I find it rare that each new Borne movie can be as good or better than the original. This is no exception and by far the best Borne yet.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|A great escape.  I wish the episodes were three times as long.  Great actors, such a brilliant re-creation of a more civilized time.
B0051ANPZQ|2.0|A predictable feel-good story best for 4th and 5th graders.  The author really \\"spells out\\" the themes so it's good only for independent reader rather than discussion.
0596009208|4.0|Somehow I got confused when ordering this. I was trying to learn visual basic but got a book on java instead. I ended up giving it to a friend, but it seemed like a helpful resource for learning java
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|very fun game, great graphics. i love the animations, they run very smooth on my lg moto. sound effects make you seem like you are really in the jungle. i would recommend this game to anyone.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It shows my kids there is a lot more to having a horse than just riding &amp; feeding them.  Lots fun for myself &amp; my daughter.
B0047Y0FGY|1.0|I was bitterly disappointed in her so-called memoirs.  None of her stories grabbed or captivated my attention. I wouldn't waste my money on this book, if I were given a second chance!
B0079XPUOW|1.0|Let me start by saying I had read his earlier books & very much enjoyed them. Based on that I had preordered this book. I am not sure what to add on top of the previous reviews except to say that it is a different approach from his earlier books.I kept waiting and waiting for an interesting twist that I could enjoy. But the only thing that struck me was that out of all the other science fiction books out there that I had read in baen library to independent books on amazon, this was the only one that I had bought that I wish I could throw back. I do realize he took a risk in this particular approach. But all I could think of when I read this when I was overseas was what a waste of time this was for me. After reading this, equating it to any star trek stories is like comparing 'The Expance'(in star trek- Enterprise) to normal space & time.( I had to look it up about the expance as I am not a trekkie). Overall the story was a disappointment to me. After that didn't have the patience to read the codas.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|The Eye of God makes unfathomable real world information a necessary component of the adventure.  The characters of Sigma novels have become comfortable companions through the years and I always enjoy spending more time with them.
B008Y2X78S|4.0|Excellent series with many twists and turns. Love Steve B in this role as it fits him perfectly. Sorry, we will miss you Jimmy.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|It now has become as commercialised as the tv version. Complete with adds and we lost the I witness why would I have to create a account separate  just for that?  I got the app for simplicity. I can watch television for all the other stuff. Maybe make the older version as. Basic ?
1419702238|5.0|My niece absolutely loves these books and this was the only one she couldn't find. Very happy that I found it on here for such a great price!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is the best app ever with the newest update and the next update will for sure have Redstone so stop saying why should I get this?and just get this app!(;
0767903862|5.0|Bill Bryson is someone who I've read before, so I was already aware I'd be encountering another truly wonderful report; so no hesitation there.  However, can a travelogue written before the rise of a pervasive Internet and economic globalization enlighten the contemporaneous reader in 2013 and beyond?  I say yes, unequivocally yes.<br /><br />Bryson is one of the greats given his rare ability to make his craft look easy.  But don't be fooled into thinking the casual conversational style presents no meat here; enjoy the read while Bryson's observations and insight into a unique country seep into your psyche.<br /><br />Australia is big country and therefore an accurate description demands someone who can handle broad topics.  Mr. Bryson's, [[ASIN:B00817QG7U A Short History of Nearly Everything]] illustrates he was up for such a broad task.  This is further buttressed within the confines of a travelogue on a far narrower topic, Bryson's [[ASIN:0307279464 A Walk in the Woods: Rediscovering America on the Appalachian Trail]].<br /><br />I suggest one way to validate Mr. Bryson's insight still holds is to set-up RSS feeds to present yourself with various Australia media reports to purview as you simultaneously read \\"Sunburned\\".  You'll find Bryson's ability to capture an understanding of place and people rivals; yes I dare assert it, Alexis de Tocqueville's insight into the U.S.  Not that \\"Sunburned\\" is as ambitious or broad-ranging as [[ASIN:0226805360 Democracy in America]], it's not close; nor did Bryson even attempt such a massive undertaking here.  But the observational and analysis skills displayed by Bryson meet de Tocqueville's standard; therefore the reader and Australia wins.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a awsome game! Its addictin! Just cant ever seem to find the exact same one! There is to many different ones, but its still fun!
B00BP4ZNFM|5.0|My son, his son and myself love this movie! That makes 3 generations it has encouraged to think \\"what if...\\"
B0063M22QO|4.0|Relaxing and enjoyable. The games increased in difficulty as I went along. The timed version would be more challenging than the classic if you want that.
B009YP9L7U|2.0|Very &#34;meh&#34; storyline.<br /><br />The hero comes on super strong in trying to persuade the heroine to give their &#34;marriage&#34; a chance and then cools off and claims he only wants a marriage of friendship and convenience, not love. Seemed totally incompatible with his previous behaviour.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|The first time I played this game I love it its like temple run but better and fun for all
0321647440|5.0|Within 2 days of not only reading but reworking some of my photos with using each step in this book my photos have shown a  fantastic improvement.  If your looking for a book to guide you through making your photos look professional this is the book for you.  This book has worked so well for me i have open up old photos that I thought were beyond help and they look awesome, i could not believe the quality of some of those images after processing using this book.  It's a must buy if you use Aperture.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|The book offered great story telling, light humor, astonishing history, insight into old unique cultures living in modern day Mexico, insight into a world ever-growing sport which is ultra running, and extremely interesting anatomical conversation.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Bring back the old app - this is cumbersome, slow, and I can't navigate easily.  I'm ready to remove the Weather Channel from my tablet completely.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game I wish a lot more people played (realms -multiplayer ) I wish I could somun heroine I tried every thing.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I recommend this app to anyone. It is a very fun app! This app has more creative puzzles. I hope it has many levels.
0062059963|5.0|What a great sequel. I was not expecting it to be this good. It was exciting, romantic, and it kept me turning the pages saying just one more. I am so glad she got to stay. They have to end up together. When does book 3 come out? I can't wait!!!
B005QMOZOO|1.0|Unfortunately Ms James is definitely past her sell-by date. The book's language, plot and characters lack any substance, depth and dimension. The dialogue - what very little there is - is hopelessly wooden and unbelievable. Darcy, Elizabeth et al. have absolutely nothing in common with Austen's immortal and brilliant characters. By the end of the book (and it was a real struggle to finish it) I was feeling embarrassed on behalf of the author, and wondering why this book was ever allowed to be published as it can only damage James's sterling reputation. And what a shame that is.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This is a fun game to revisit a few times a day to play until your coins run out, and then come back again when they've replenished. Love it!
B00CLT31D6|3.0|The author devotes the entire book  &#34;documenting&#34; one simple idea.  The idea is logical, (spend less than you earn) but certainly not new.
0385737955|5.0|This book was absolutely amazing. It's a worthy read, and it is certainly worth the money.<br /><br />I'm not going to summarize the story, many other reviewers have already done that.<br /><br />--------my opinions--------<br /><br />This book was definitely a page-turner. It kept me up thinking about it, and what would happen next. The descriptions in this book are great. Dashner uses gripping words and vocabulary just ready to glue your eyes to the book. The plot of the book was probably the main reason I loved this book. Although the book may contain some violence (e.g. executions, deaths, murders), I am guessing that's all part of the making of the extraordinary superglue that Dashner has developed to glue your eyes to the book. And if I'm right, Dashner has certainly done a good job on it.<br /><br />Overall, amazing read, and you will not regret it. It is 100% worth your money, and I highly recommend this book to readers of 10 years+. A suspenseful cliffhanger at the end makes sure that you will be buying the rest of the trilogy ASAP!<br /><br />K.W.<br /><br />**recommend this book for lovers of Harry Potter and The Hunger Games**
B0027Z837S|5.0|This movie is cult classic material.  Has a lot of slapstick humor, martial arts, and the villains are quite villainous!  Beware the Axe Gang!!
1451695195|3.0|Saw all the reviews prior to purchase, and thought it might be a worthwhile read, but was disappointed in the story.  Seemed to have read similar stories from combat or other stressful situations.  Best wishes for a healthy life for the neurosurgeon.
B008Y72BD0|2.0|It was somewhat entertaining.  Has a political agenda, I'm sure. The artsiness of it was ok, and the plot was easy to follow.
B0011ZNAIC|1.0|Sorry, but this movie didn't make any sense. And it wasn't that it didn't make any sense in a funny way; it was just dumb. The plot was way all over the place and in the parts it did try to stick to one story line the results were not, even a little, funny or entertaining. The whole concept of humans being evil for imprisoning, robbing and exploiting bees I think came directly out of the PETA manifesto. Usually I wouldn't take a cartoon seriously when it tries to be a little preachy, but this movie takes it too far, then tries to put a band aide over it by claiming to be a comedy. I was happy when the movie finally ended, though I may petition Jerry Seinfeld for my hour and a half back.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|really fun game.  I love it.  not too easy n not too hard. not a kiddies game.  a free  object search that keeps you thinking. love it.
B003477DVK|5.0|It's a laugh and cry and then be happy after it over movie.  Watch it with grandchildren 6 and up.  Language is not bad enough to stop it from being seen.  Dog movies are always good.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Fun game and the minions are very funny I love the minions, I have been waiting for a minion game.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|I hadn't even started playing and it was looking for money to continue.  Removed it right away.  Sometimes free isn't really free!
B00CPTUNBK|1.0|I thought the movie was a complete flop it was way off from the cartoon storys.Whoever wrote the movie never saw the cartoon and only wanted to make a movie.I beleve kids could have done better or those who have grown up around my little pony friend ship is magic sinse it came out in 2010.They could have made a better movie where twilight has to searsh all over the land of equestria in towns and citys.Citys like Mainhatin,phlydelphia,trotingham.hoofington,ponyvile,and canterlot to name a few from the cartoon.IF you chose to buy this dvd it's not what you'd expect.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun game to play! Addicting in a good way! Would have given 5 stars but some of the times the hints get stuck
B004259BMM|4.0|This is a very good CD musically, with the best part being the guitar work. Keith Urban has surprised me with how good a guitarist that he is, and I'm usually a person who mainly likes listening to good lyrics. Buy it, listen to it, and mainly enjoy it.
B00AMBLDEE|4.0|this movie is good.  there is action, adventure, love, and even some pill popping.  my favorite part is when the bad guy dies.
B00BPWDMP2|3.0|Lady Antebellum is a great group, and wonderful to listen to. However, compared to other CDs that they have put out, this one is not as good. Some of the songs I have to fast forward through, since they were \\"too\\" country for my taste. If you're a true Lady Antebellum follower, you might like this CD.
B006O5XYWG|3.0|this movie has apes.  they are intelligent to a certain point.  they end up living in san francisco or something... but anyway, check it out.  caromellow.
B003L77GRO|2.0|While this product came in a timely manner the first disk had an issue where one of the episodes would continually skip, there were no scratches on the disk which made it impossible to find the malfunction, however the vendor agreed to send a new copy which was great.
B003FM1MNO|4.0|i like when the trees smash up the bad guy factory and when the helms deep goes all deep and helmy on the bad guys.  it's very lordy and ringy all up in this piece.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I thought this show would be stuffy and boring(even though I love gothic lit). I was SO wrong!! It has it all, love, tragedy, humor, mystery and scandal. I love how they explore what we think are modern issues(infertility, homosexuality). I'm only sad I have to wait till jan to see what happens next.
B0063M22QO|4.0|This game is Great, keeps my mind alert n the symbols can get a little tricky sometimes.  This is a Great game to keep u alert n observant.<br />I would recommend this game to everyone who likes any kind o matching game.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|A real page turner. Could hardly put it down.  Definitely among his best work and I've read most of his wok over the years.
B001KP2J3U|5.0|I'm a huge fan of bothPeter Ustinov and Agatha Christi.  This is one of the best in the series that was done at the time.  I play the DVD all the time.
0545425115|5.0|I watched the movie when it came out in theatres without having read the book and thought the movie was ok.  Friends that did read the book told me the movie did not do the book justice.  So, after seeing a great deal on Amazon for the book, (less than 2 bucks, I think!), thought I'd check it out.  If you liked the movie AT ALL..you will LOVE the book.  Or, if you are like some of my friends and hated the movie (they were kind of right)...there is still a pretty good chance you will LOVE the book. :)
B00CBKLO52|4.0|it is not so bad but could be better by giving at least a couple more places that you could launch you aircraft or boat from but all in all its not a bad practice app for flying your helicopter
8361421475|5.0|Very Good, Outstanding Copy,shipped in a timely matter. condition was in very good to Ex.cond.so I rated this Book very high, a must for all aircraft lovers.....Thanks
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Nice variation of the run and jump.  As others have said - an expanded &quot;Subway Surfer&quot;.  Good goals and story.  Good graphics and controls.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I cant wait tell 0.8.1 comes out thanks for making a awesome game. I play everyday .and have fun playing with my little sister
B00D6OV57O|5.0|This is a GREAT soundtrack!!! Hans Zimmer did an amazing job. A must have for all soundtrack junkies like myself!
B00BSWMITK|2.0|Comparisons are inevitable. Clearly, Joe can not compete with John in virtuosity. But it also crystal clear that Joe could compete with John in clarity.  And this is the only argument Joe can have against John. Unfortunately, Joe has not used it for this disk. Too much of unneeded texture overshadows the guitar line. There is too little cantilena  and a  lot of naked drums fetched from the background. Overall, all compositions are bit dated in terms of perception and delivery. Time to rest, Joe?
B000NTHT6G|4.0|As a writer this one touched me. I love the concept that someone else can write the events of a man's life and the man lrarns to take back that control.  Best thing Will Ferrell ever did.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|A bit difficult for a computer newbie and it could use more complete instructions, but on the whole quite a cute little learning game.
B007UK83S4|5.0|Bloody good read, been a Who fan for decades and loved Pete`s explanation of his fantastic life from cover to cover.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|So I watched this movie and I read the book. I hate to say this, but I might just prefer the movie. I never do, but in this case I think the movie shows a bit more of an adult relationship between the characters. Overall it's just a very sweet movie, without falling into the same annoying romantic movie mold. I'm not always the biggest fan of chick flicks because they are so predictable and often so cutsey that my teeth heart. This one had some good comedic moments in it to lighten it up, and had a pretty good plot too!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|While I didn't like the ending of Season 3 (I won't spoil anything) Downton Abbey still remains one of my favorite shows of all time.  The actors are wonderful and complement the writing perfectly.  I like how some of the characters have evolved greatly since Season 1 and will continue to watch this series just to see what happens next.
B00ALYY6ZA|3.0|I like the thought behind this, but after 2 months of strict adherence I had only shed 2 pounds.  Not enough reward for the effort!  One month on Medifast and I have lost 20 pounds!  This might be a good maintenance program after a successful diet but doesn't seem to work for me as the ONLY diet.
B00DGNO3WE|5.0|Mr. Hoffman's first directing  job, step one, find the best people you can. From here, they make it look easy. Great job !!!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Heard a funny statement on NPR radio about how all Americans think England is like &#34;Downton Abbey&#34; and all English think American is like &#34;Breaking Bad.&#34;  Well I want to live at Downton Abbey, for sure, and not in the Breaking Bad world, but don't miss that show either!  Wonderful examples of TV well done!
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Up dating Holmes, seemed a stretch. The show is well written, the characters multi-dimensional, in general, it has been a pleasant surprise.
B001NA6096|1.0|Why did critics like this?  I have never been more bored by banal conversation!  Tried the next one in the trilogy just to be fair and shut it down after 10 minutes.  More of the same drivel!  To be honest, I find Ethan Hawke kind of repulsive.  What did Uma ever see in this cad?
1476733953|5.0|Moments ago, an unlikely event happened.  I finished a book.  Not just any book, but this book.  It has been an embarrassingly long literary dry spell, brought on by lack of time and lack of attention span.  Neither sufficient reasonings in hindsight.  However, I tried to invest my time wisely to read more, but the books I picked up, I soon put down.  In short, they didn't grab me.<br /><br />This one, however, grabbed me and shook me back to life.  I picked it up and didn't want to put it down, but when I did put it down, it was to pace myself and reflect on the literary goodness I had just experienced.<br /><br />Hugh Howey, have a forever fan in me, friend.<br /><br />If you're thinking about the book, and reading this review, just buy it.  You will be happy you did.
B00BXUG0KU|4.0|Eliane has a very smooth voice and lovely delivery.  Only the tiniest hint of an accent.  Lovely background music for cocktail hour.
B00C3UUZVE|4.0|No patience required for this game. It is cute and little ones will like the adorableness of the characters and the ease of play.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|I think this is the best one yet. But I think they should make a star wars cut the rope.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book, easy to read, great story that gets you ready for the next book. 100% recommended, I can't wait to read the next one.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love the this app. But I love the computer version, I just wish they had the same updates.That would  make it  the best app ever.
B00992CF6W|5.0|it is just a great game for everyone who loves mojangs games and if you love survival games but get the demo to see if you like it
B0083SBJXS|5.0|This is a great movie! If you're a fan of anything in the Marvel universe, go for it. Tony Stark is hilarious and interacts well with the other Avengers.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Good drama and so well written that it could almost be real.<br />Enjoyed the setting and personalities of each character.
B00BDZV9M4|4.0|product as described. it was a gift for a friend and they enjoy it. no complaints about the cd so far
B00CNGA1PS|2.0|I found it confusing to use. Didn't really get the point of it. Ended up removing it because it was not of any real use to me.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I've never played this kind of game before. The rules aren't helpful when starting the game. With that being said,  I still enjoyed the game. After you've opened a few doors it becomes easier to locate clues since you can anticipate what needs to be completed before the door will open. Definitely a game I'll want to continue when the next level is complete.
B000IZ8SD8|5.0|Love the Borg on tv series...this continues the story.  Like the interaction between the queen, the captain picard and data.
B0083Z614S|5.0|I just read this book and I smiled the entire time! Such a happy great book. I've never cried tears of<br />happiness and beauty before but this did it. Seriously fills you with the Magic! Love love loved it.
B006Z7XNVK|2.0|There are two other movies of cult indoctrination that I know of.  The best is called &#34;Ticket to Heaven&#34; and the other is called &#34;Split Image.&#34;  Both are very good.<br /><br />I am interested in how cults convince people that its a great idea to shave their heads, eat tofu, beg for money, and spout nonsense.  This movie gave me no insights.  It confused me because it intercut scenes of the protagonist in the cult and also at home with her family after her indoctrination and decision to leave the cult.  I couldn't tell that was what was going on.  Plus, it was really boring.  The characters displayed all the emotion of a socket wrench.  Was that the point?  Who cares?
B0094BB4TW|5.0|downloaded to my new kindle fire HD, so I could check it on the go if I am at a wifi hotspot.  I would recommend this app for anyone who is signed up on facebook.
B000I8G5NU|2.0|Where's the action, you know?  Also, I don't care about antelopes.  I only watched about half of this movie, and it was boring.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|When I was playing with the game it is awesome but I can't get rainbow dash and rarity sweetie . Belle
B00CL68NOG|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. It was nice to see a movie that did not need profanity or violence to be entertaining.
B0012GTZC0|3.0|Follett's habit of writing in the present perfect tense is disconcerting. He's a wonderful storyteller in need of an editor.
B003F44QRQ|4.0|Watched this movie at home. Remember watching this when it was new and still liked it after all of this time.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|THIS IS THE BEST FREE APP DICTIONARY AVAILIABLE BAR NONE.  EASY TO USE AND MAKE OTHER APPS APPEAR AS A ONE STAR RATING.  i LOVE IT.
B000FC1AGG|4.0|A fun book, EASY to read and enjoyable. This would be a great take on vacation book. All the characters were fun EASY to know and believable.  This would probably be a good Life Time movie.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|The Weather Channel has always been great, but with this new format, it is AWESOME. The updated look is cool and easy to follow and to find different info. Only now, a person can earn points every time they log in towards meaningful rewards. Gotta love that.
B004JN1D2I|4.0|Great story! The writer doesn't follow Normal story telling techniques. It gets rough at points, and you'll hate it at times,  but it's worth the read.
0425263924|5.0|Third book in the Crossfire series! Again, I loved it! I am an avid reader of serial killer fiction & for me to read something other than my norm, it has to be good. This series took me away from the craziness of my day & made me feel like a hopeless romantic. My poor husband couldn't speak to me until I finished the book-in one sitting! I hope there is one more story in this series. I truly enjoyed it.
B005TBN3EU|3.0|Kept attention due to stressful senerios, however it lacked the true laugh out loud comedy that the original delivered in the first Hangover.
0425263916|5.0|This is the second book in the Crossfire series! Its very enjoyable like the first book in the series. As the story progressed, I found myself more invested in the characters & falling in that deep romantic love we all dream of. I read this book in one day & had to wait months for the 3rd book. Do yourself a favor, buy the whole series @ once. You won't be able to put them down.
B0017KIBAI|5.0|It's a game cube controller, made by Nintendo, and it's new, and not that expensive, and it's cord is longer. I would go on, but in the end, it's exactly what you would expect, and I love it.
0425263908|5.0|This book & it successors are a much more believable & a better read than 50 Shades of Boredom. The characters were relatable & the erotic components were not thrown in your face or overwhelming. Some components were erotic while others were romantic. I felt for Gideon & the pain & abuse he suffered as well as Eva. Crank up your AC! Shut your phones off! & lose yourself in Eva & Gideon's story! Christian Gray, watch out! Gideon Cross is more of a man than you-LOL!
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|riveting, kept going,  wanting to keep watching next episode...but bed time called, but can't wait to finish and catch Season 2
B004DLPXAO|5.0|It was great to discover that I could download a Kindle app for my notepad - I only learnt of this recently after my kindle reader was stolen and I still wanted to use the extensive library I was beginning to build up through Amazon. This has made a huge difference to my reading and I am now a very happy reader once more!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Just when I wonder how they will create even more drama and interest, Downton Abbey comes through.  Amazing season 3.  Looking forward to season 4 and hopefully many more.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|I hardly knew my Saturday was gone.  A very enjoyable read.  I can't wait for the next book in the series.
B0052UYJDC|5.0|This was a very interesting book. I learned a lot and can't wait to try decluttering and simplifying my life.
B009P0U7H2|5.0|Down to earth explanation of science.  It is one thing to have knowledge, it is another to be able to readily communicate this knowledge to the public at large.
B00A6RCSKC|5.0|A lot of fun. I highly recommend this game to everyone.You don't need money to play which is great. Enjoy!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this is a fantastic game I'm hooked already. my three year wld love it also cnt wait too show him
076532413X|2.0|I wasn't expecting it to be anything like the tv series, and it's not. The story line is interesting, but the author tries too much to be smart and philosophical about time and other stuff. It makes the book a pain to read, I didn't even read the end. I read until very close to it because I was intrigued by what was going to happen, but nothing very smart...
0544139453|3.0|I was disappointed by this book. I agree with a reviewer I read somewhere who said the pacing of this novel feels like a rushed MFA novel thesis; Hamid builds the exposition and background of this story at quite a leisurely pace only to quite awkwardly and sloppily rush its ending to the point of absurdity.<br /><br />There is one thing I loved about this book and three which caused its failure.<br /><br />Let's start positive---the psychological ground explored here is deeply interesting to me. We're often beguiled by the \\"banality of evil\\" and wonder how seemingly decent people can commit indecent acts. So that curiosity kept me turning the pages.<br /><br />Hamid's manner of writing was off putting on two levels. One, as this book takes the form of a monologue, Hamid attempts to work in the dialogue from the narrator's dinner partner so awkwardly it's often downright laughable. Granted, the form Hamid chose is a difficult one into which another character can express himself, but Hamid relies on an increasingly irritating and lazy trick of having the narrator REPEAT everything his dinner guest supposedly says so that we can \\"hear\\" it. This leads to sophomoric dialogue writing along the lines of \\"Oh, you say you wonder if it was difficult for me to continue to ignore my homeland? and \\"Ah, I too am wondering what those suspicious men are looking at\\" and \\"Ah yes, go ahead, type out a response to that phone call on your peculiar looking mobile phone.\\" This gets incredibly tiresome.<br /><br />The writing also suffers from robotic formality. It's clear that Hamid is working his way up to the \\"surprise\\" ending throughout because he does so with such a heavy hand.<br /><br />Finally, I simply don't buy the psychological transformation Hamid is selling. Perhaps it's due to the uneven pacing, but the speaker goes from Princeton graduate/Manhattan financier to Anti-American activist in so little time and in far too easy a trite a manner. It's simply unbelievable that the character Hamid spends the first 85% of the book developing would end up doing what he does in the last 15%.
B006MPKAOI|5.0|I could not put this book down despite it making me so tense. I felt like I didn't breathe for chapters! A chilling story that you just can't turn away from.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|this is a great app to manage your social life and keepnin touch with old friends or even stalk the biggest. celebs
B0079TQHDO|4.0|I jumped straight into this book after finishing the first one. It was a really good read that leaves you on a cliff hanger, just like the first one. I felt the first one packed more into the story than this one, but I liked the setting of New York which added something new to the story. I will definitely be reading number 3 to find out how the story ends.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|it is fun I love it it a hole lot of fun you should get it you do not need to do enything
B00DI75SWM|3.0|Cute app but closes out every time I try to save the wallpaper. Maybe can be fixed by a n update?
B001L5YW9I|5.0|Loved it when it was released and typically watch it once a year. A classic story. Great acting all around.
B00881PTRC|5.0|This is a really good game for all ages, keeps me entertain for a while and helps on spelling :-) .
B000VHXBIU|5.0|It's definitely a comedy for those who appreciate dry humor it's the kind of comedy flick you need to &#34;get&#34; kinda like Spinal Tap.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|It really works as a flashlight. I like it very much. They require 9 more words to end this review but how much can you say of a flashlight other than it works great. Silly really.
B0032KLAKE|5.0|Richard Gere was the draw.  Ed Norton made what was a typical &#34;star&#34; picture into something special. This one you need to watch from beginning to final credits.  Amazing performance by Norton.
B000W4D94I|5.0|I love this movie. I had the DVD but of course I had to buy the BluRay when I found a chance.
B009DJB8I2|5.0|I love Mike Morasky's work on this soundtrack, and it includes music from the first Portal game, too! Also, if you have Team Fortress 2, it gives you a Genuine-quality Ap-Sap, which is a building sapper for the Spy, but it looks like Wheatley and talks just like him, too (complete with Stephen Merchant's acting).
B0091VTISO|2.0|I found this movie a bit slow. Giving it two stars as there was a great deal of blood but not a lot of substance.
B009G7ZYPY|4.0|Susan Boyle has a consistently good tone and very good pitch. I enjoy her emotional interpretation of each song. This is a very good album. I have been able to see consistent growth in her work.
B00138F8UU|5.0|another album i owned on cd years ago. loved it then, i love it now. very happy with my purchase.
B007JOM0GC|4.0|I love this song, but I wish Amazon hadn't charged me TWICE for it!!!  I mean, how many times do they think I need to buy the same song?  And when you send an email to C/S, they don't seem to see it.
B004EPZ0H0|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book, the history of the Lacks family along side the development of cell science over the decades was fascinating.  I do not have a medical background but I found the science/ethics side of the story very interesting.  It is a tragedy that the the Lacks family were not able to benefit in any way from the use of Henrietta's cells in the development of  medical advances.
B007XGJK4G|5.0|This is an in depth portrayal of Marley's life and it provides a better understanding of the basis for his songs and many of the choices he made. It helped me view him with more compassion.  Great and unvarnished interviews that show his strengths and weaknesses and reveal the depth of his soulfulness.  And of course, there is the music!!
B005K17RU0|3.0|I like the hourly and 10 day forecast with the radar maps.<br />I don't t like how it loads each time I want to look at it.<br />kit it better than the New format from the weather channel,  which I realliy liked before they changed the format.<br />Nana
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Nice graphics, great puzzles.  Will recommend this to all my puzzle addicted friends.  Please make more.  In the meantime I am going to play it again. Thanks

B0063GORYU|5.0|i love this game, play it on the computer all the time. works great on my phone when there's nothing else to do lol.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is tuff. I'm so enjoying it right now. The graphics are great. Way better then temple run or  angry gran
B008FYZIVY|5.0|We had heard from so many people about this program and had missed it on tv.  We also wanted to start from the beginning and catch up to the present show.  My husband is enjoying it as much as me.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|This is a very good just need to say you have to have a open wallet for this game. You are also going to need patients because to level up you need to buy things.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Great book and series, I could not put it down, I think it was a great love story, where both empowered the other.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Woah. That was an epic book. I was captivated by it the whole time I was reading this amazing book.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Great book and series, I could not put it down, I think it was a great love story, where both empowered the other.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|For everyone cool cool cool loved it it's fun and my hole family loves y'all should play this game just fun
B009NY43NY|3.0|I was a huge fan of this series but this last book lacked passion . I was always disappointed in the True Blood series,for not following the books . BUT now I hope they continue on that path.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|TEC on tv was great - weather, forecasts, smart people giving you great information. Then they changed the over-the-air product and I quit watching them. When I got my kindle, TEC was one of the first apps I installed. It was marvelous. Then came the July 2013 update, and now this app is unusable and useless. The really sad thing about this change is that it shows that upper management at TWC has forgotten their own name - the WEATHER channel. Read all the 1 star reviews and you'll get the idea-bad interface, bad graphics, hidden info, missing functions, new purpose (what, I don't know), and a generally horrible experience all the way around. From first to worst in one 30 second update. Someone should lose their job over this, but they will probably get a huge bonus instead.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I always wanted to read this story and after reading Wicked, I am not disappointed. I could see how the stories weave together
B00C81AVNU|4.0|very interesting cd.  some good songs, look forward to it being produced in Australia in the near future.  quite enjoyable.
B00ADS98FC|3.0|enjoyed the movie, thought it was ok after wifes urging to watch I found myself enjoying it<br />That about it
B007VUCAVO|5.0|For the last six months I have been relying on this app for detailed information on my energy use for those need to know situations.  Great app, no complaints.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|By about half way through, I realized the author must have been as bored with the story as I was.
0553386816|5.0|I hadn't gotten the chance to read in a while! This book was really good. I liked the short stories. All of them were well written and kept me interested. I really enjoyed the Casino Story and Lawyer's Divorce stories. If you're a fan of grisham, you're really going to like this story.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The whole 3 seasons are outstanding! I loved every minute. Wish there was a fourth & fifth season. Thank you for having it on Amazon Prime!
0307949508|5.0|I thought The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo was one of the most clever books I had read in years and this sequel comes very close to matching it.  From the little I saw of the movies I was expecting endless and mindless mayhem, but that is not the case. Stieg Larsson has given us some very complex characters in a story that is still only partially revealed. There are a few untidy loose ends (why all these detectives, policemen, and lawyers) but maybe we need those characters down the road.<br /><br />We meet Salander again a year or so after the conclusion of the first book. She has been enjoying her ill-begotten money, vacationing on the islands, reading very advanced mathematics texts, drinking, smoking, and tutoring young men. Next thing she is back in Sweden, accused of homocide, and the subject of a national search.  Fortunately she managed her money and affairs in typical Salander double-secret style so no one finds her for some time and she starts to work on solving the murder case, even bringing Blomkvist back onto her team, albeit with great trepidation and more secrecy.<br /><br />Eventually the tide turns and it becomes clear that Salander did not commit the murders even though she had links to all the victims.  Then for fun, we have some great fight scenes involving retired boxers, a giant who does not feel pain, and some motorcycle riding hoodlums with slow wits and reflexes.<br /><br />The theme in this book is the sex trade and those who participate in it, profit from it, and are hypocritical about their roles. The slain journalists and Bloomkvist were close to blowing the lid on illegal activities over decades, involving everyone in government and industry. Finally we learn more about Salander's youth, family, and fire-starting activities.
B008LFY6NI|5.0|My grand kids ask me to get this for my Kindle Fire so they could use it to make pretty designs. There are several different shapes to choose from in which you can color many different ways. There is a button that when touched starts the shape spinning so when you start to add color, it makes a spinning wheel affect. This will let a child spend hours changing shapes and colors with no two ever looking the same. This is for both boy or girl. Well worth putting it on your device.
B000JMKQX0|3.0|The book manages to build excitement many times, but then dilutes it by switching characters and effectively starting over.  Action and the expected narrative energy are defeated by the narrative structure.  Many evocative scenes and characterizations make the book a worthwhile read.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|This review contains no spoilers.<br /><br />Ethan Burke is in a world of trouble. From the moment he wakes up he and the reader are on a journey of immense discovery to find out exactly what is going on.<br /><br />The author does a fantastic job of building suspense, mystery, and chest tightening fear. As the book moves forward the reader can't help but feel for this lone man through what he is fighting for and has been through.<br /><br />At times I did feel as though Ethan was more than human and this did detract from the story somewhat but never did it make me want to put the book down. I wanted to keep moving forward and figure out what was going  on almost as much as the main character.<br /><br />Near the end I thought I had the mystery solved but was pleasantly surprised to find I was incorrect. This book will keep most readers guessing and turning the page just as a good mystery should. If you are looking for a great mystery with elements of horror I would say give this book a shot. I know I didn't regret it.
B00D6BN9NK|4.0|Willis' character has has gone from an unassuming victim caught in extreme circumstances to a wild near super hero in the various iterations of the die hard saga. It's Bruce being Bruce; no acting involved. It's all a Bruce Willis movie should be with plenty of action, lots of effects and plenty of smirks.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game , very challenging. I like all the levels and the new rooms to try and get out very fun can't wait for more levels.
B00CH26TL8|4.0|I really like this game. But it gets really hard in the upper levels and you can't complete a level without buying the extra's to help you.
B005FMZX9Q|5.0|I really luv my watch I get lots of compliment from others and for the price it's a steal looks expensive.
B00881VLCE|2.0|i don't like this app because it is very hard to move the pieces of the puzzle to connect them.
B006LSZECO|3.0|A little hard to follow but stay with it.  You really learn your characters before you get into the meat of th story, so you are strung along with those in the book.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Great app to keep you updated on weather in your area. You can also add several locations to see what the weather  is doing there. I Love it because it has hour to hour updates and great radar pics in real time!!!!

B009ZM74F8|5.0|Some previous reviewers liken this movie to the Matrix, but this is comparison is less accurate than it might be.  Fahrenheit 451 take place in a distopic future where books (paper ignites at 451 F), music<br />all things that might give you emotion are forbidden. The protagonist here is a \\"fireman\\" in charge of burning this type of contraband...well if I keep going I will just spoil this movie with Christian Bale playing a similar role as did Oskar Werner in 1966.
B0010VHXOE|5.0|Ok well, I'll start by saying \\"just slide the cd in your car radio\\" because of all the bad reviews here on Amazon I passed on it a few months ago but I recently purchased this cd used in new condition at a goodwill store, all I can say is that this cd is still in my car radio for a week now, this man is a great music artist and this record is awesome, whenever a song stands out on the first listen (in this case track #2) of a record but then with every listen from 1 to 10 the rest of the songs and I mean every song on the record end up being better than the stand out song, guess I won't attempt to play it on my computer but who cares because I'll just go out to my car and push play and ride on...
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|This band is incredible and look forward to seeing them when they make to our neck of the woods! Fantastic!
B001NLL93W|5.0|I love the world this book creates. My fellow readers and I agree that this book is really hard to put down. If you want to read something that is ten times better then twilight this is a good choice :). There is a strong female lead which is a nice change.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|An awesome book written to portray a brilliant man. A totally unbiased depiction of Jobs. I almost gave up reading at the start because of Jobs personality in his early days. But thank God I went on to complete it, because that justified everything he did. I know there will be someone else who will lead us into the tech future. But it will be hard to get another JOBS. RIP Mr. JOBS.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is GREAT. I've been playing temple run for a while, but I like this much better. (That might have something to do with the minion sound effects)
B002ZG975Q|4.0|I read Beastly in almost one sitting. It was a very fast, sweet read and I love the tale of Beauty & The Beast. Alex Flinn nailed it when adapting this tale into a modern day retelling. As with all movie adaptations I was a little worried that the movie would spoil the sweet story I had envisioned as I read the book. My initial concerns were only face value:<br /><br />1.) Vanessa Hudgens did not physically fit the character of Lindy.<br />2.) Kyle wasn't a &#34;Beast&#34; he was more of a victim of an angry tattoo artist<br />3.) The standard plea...&#34;Oh please stay true to the book&#34;<br /><br />I am very happy to report that I (and Kelli) truly enjoyed this movie! I loved all the changes that were made for the big screen. Alex Pettyfer is on FIRE! And he did great portraying Kyle/Grant/Adrian. I actually think that Kyle was more disturbing in the movie and a true modern day beast. I really liked the tree tattoo that kept track of the passing year & Mary Kate Olsen really pulled off Kendra the Witch. And how funny was Neil Patrick Harris?! I loved him as Will. He really gave the movie the comic relief that was needed just at the right moments.<br /><br />Right after watching the movie my little sister immediately went and bought the book and read it straight through... who says movies can't motivate the youth to read :)<br /><br />This is a great book and movie for tweens and up!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|i like it! makes you think and have a lot of pressure. its so a different game and its fun to expend the time.
B004LQI0HE|3.0|I saw the trailer for Never Let Me Go and it reminded me of one of my favorite books: Neal Shusterman's Unwind.  The concepts of &#34;donations&#34; and &#34;completion&#34; were similar to the &#34;unwinding&#34; in Unwind, and since I loved that concept in Unwind, I decided to watch Never Let Me Go.<br /><br />I know that Never Let Me Go is based on a book of the same name; however, I have not read the book.  I almost always prefer to read the book before seeing the movie, but in this case, due to lack of reading time, I made an exception.<br /><br />My first problem with Never Let Me Go was that I had a really hard time understanding the dialogue.  All of the characters have British accents (something I usually enjoy), but they spoke very quickly and were all &#34;low talkers.&#34;  I couldn't turn the volume up high enough to hear everything properly without blasting my husband and baby out of the house, so, about 15 minutes in, I ended up turning on the subtitles.<br />So, subtitles on, I settled in to watch the rest of the movie.  I will admit that I knew the premise of the story because I read the plot on IMDB.  I know, I know, I broke all of my rules with this movie!  I don't think I would have known what was going on had I not read the plot, though, so I'm glad I did.<br /><br />Never Let Me Go is an emotional thriller.  There is not a lot of excitement, just sadness.  The characters are steeped in a pervasive desperation, enveloped in quiet despair.  One thing that bothered me was how skinny the characters are.  You'd think that a boarding school devoted to keeping its students in perfect health would have fed them more!<br /><br />The entire movie mad me so sad that when the credits started rolling I told my husband I would have been better off watching Parks and Recreation (which was my other available choice).  Never Let Me Go had the emotional impact of Unwind, but without the hopeful ending.  I would recommend it for people looking for a movie that makes you think.  If you want to be entertained and uplifted (like me), then try something else.kes you think.  If you want to be entertained and uplifted (like me), then try something else.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love Minions! This game is so much fun to play. Very addicting. Great graphics. So happy to have found this app.
1620404869|3.0|3.5 stars<br /><br />This was a fun, light-hearted read.  I almost gave up on it about half-way through it, but right when I was about to give up the story got really interesting.  The last 75 pages saved the book for me.<br /><br />Jane is a graphic designer who has been unlucky in love.  She longs for a romance similar to Elizabeth Bennett and Mr. Darcy in Pride and Prejudice.  As a huge Pride and Prejudice fan (the book and the movie starring Keira Knightley) I was excited to read Austenland (which to me, was a retelling of Pride and Prejudice).  Jane's aunt sends her on a three-week vacation to Pemberly Park, which is basically a bunch of adults pretending that they live in 1816, complete with full Regency dress, food, restrictions on modern conveniences (cell phones, etc), and scripted romances.  Guests of Pemberly Park play Regency women, and paid actors play the men.  The actors are charged with providing the guests with a falling in love Regency-style experience, complete with a proposal at the end of the stay.  They couples have to follow the Regency rules (no walking alone together, no touching, no kissing, etc).<br /><br />The Regency dialogue felt tedious and forced at times.  This is what was making me want to give up on the book.  I'm glad I didn't though, because I really enjoyed the conclusion.  I would recommend Austenland for a chick-lit summer read and for Jane Austen fans.<br /><br />Just One Gripe:<br />The stilted Regency dialogue grated on my nerves.  It's much more tolerable when you're watching the movie and you can enjoy Mr. Darcy's accent. Now that I think of that, this would probably be a great audiobook.<br /><br />The Best Thing About This Book:<br />The conclusion and Jane's character growth.
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|it is a great game with lots of characters and nice people to play with. I deeply love this game because its online and its a little addicting.
B006TLFPKO|5.0|I saw Breaking Dawn: Part 1 at the theater but never got down to writing a review for it.  After finally receiving my Blu-Ray version from Amazon (I'm not going to forget my disappointment when they didn't pre-ship for a LONG time), I decided a review was overdue.<br /><br />I have loved all of the Twilight movies, despite the criticism they have received.  I think that Breaking Dawn: Part 1 was the best one so far, although there is a special place in my heart for the first movie.  Seeing the characters I loved so much come to life for the first time was so special.  I'll never forget how I felt the first time I saw Rob Pattinson as Edward!<br /><br />I thought that this movie could have felt slow, but the director managed to keep it exciting and full of action (even though some of that action was not found in the original story, grrr).  I was so happy that there was not part of the movie narrated from Jacob's perspective, like there is in the book.  I think it would have really slowed the movie down and changed the tone of it completely.<br /><br />My favorite part of the movie was the wedding: Bella and Edward have been heading towards that wedding since Edward walked into the cafeteria in Twilight.  Didn't Bella look so beautiful?  Although I did enjoy the honeymoon too...<br /><br />I loved the special effects, especially the way Bella looked while pregnant.  She was scary!  And I loved the way they handled her transformation.  She looked like Snow White: so beautiful!  But one question---has Kristen Stewart always been this tiny?  She is so, so small.  I could not believe how thin she looked in her wedding dress and in her swimsuit on the honeymoon.<br /><br />Overall, I loved Breaking Dawn: Part 1.  I can't wait for part two---just the flash-forwards we got of Renesmee were tantalizing and I want to see more of her, and Bella as a vampire!
0399230033|5.0|This is a family favorite. Mischievous gorilla upends security at the zoo with hilarious results and a happy ending. No words, but it really gets its humorous point across splendidly without them. Although it may seem like a book only for pre-readers, it will tickle people of every age. Don't miss it!
193700788X|3.0|I've been a long-time fan of the Sookie Stackhouse series.  I've been following the series for about six years now, and love it when May finally arrives, along with the latest Sookie book.  So, I was really excited to read the latest and final installment.<br /><br />I have been saying for a long time that I thought Sookie would end up with Sam or another human.  I think that Sookie wants a family and that she wants to eventually distance herself from the vampire world.  After seeing her sweet interactions and caring for her cousin and fellow telepath Hunter, I knew that there was no way Sookie would end up without kids.  So, I was very invested in seeing how her love life concluded.  I was happy with Harris' treatment of that part of the story.<br /><br />I have loved this series as a whole, especially the nuanced characters and detailed storyline, but the books have been hit and miss for me.  I loved the last book, Deadlocked, but thought Dead Ever After was a low point for the series.<br /><br />The writing style was completely different from the previous books.  Instead of a sole first-person narrative, Dead Ever After jumps from Sookie's point of view to a third-person POV, mostly involving interactions with \\"the devil.\\"  I hate it when books jump around like that!  There are demons in this series, yes, and I'm okay with that, but the inclusion of the real devil was out of the blue.  And it did not feel true to the tone of the rest of the series.<br /><br />I enjoyed getting to read about each of my favorite characters from the series one last time.  Just about every character shows up to help Sookie in her latest time of need (Sookie getting in trouble/death threats is a common plot device in this series).  It was fun to watch everyone help Sookie out one last time.<br /><br />Overall, I liked this book but was disappointed: I thought Harris could have done a better job and at times I even thought to myself, \\"she's phoning it in here.\\"
B003LQ3YXU|4.0|Season 1 did a good job of going new places while still connecting to the established Doctor background and Mythos.
B008602KQI|4.0|Overall, I thought it was a really great film.  I loved the acting and thought the casting was perfect.  I was not sure about Josh Hutcherson as Peeta but ending up thinking he made a great Peeta.  I am still Team Gale---is it just me or did they downplay they Gale scenes?---but am slightly more open to the idea of Peeta and Katniss together now that I've seen the movie.<br /><br />As with any book to movie adaptation, I missed the parts that were cut from the book.  The bit about the Mockingjay pin bothered me, I wanted to see more of Katniss's life before the Reaping, and I wanted to see the victory tour after the Games.  I also wanted to see Katniss break Peeta's heart at the end of the movie, like she does in the book.  Oh, burn, Peeta, burn!  I have a feeling these movies are going to be very pro-Peeta.  And I'll just have to learn to live with that.<br /><br />I loved the special effects as well as the costume design.  Those two elements really made the movie for me.  I also loved getting to see the Games through the Gamemaker's perspective.  I enjoyed seeing them manipulating the environment, and thought it added another layer of depth to the movie.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed The Hunger Games.  I can't say that it will be a movie that I buy and watch over and over again, like, say, Twilight or any of my Jane Austen films, but it was very well done and I will definitely keep watching the series.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This series is so engaging. I have watched series 1 - 3 a million times and never tire of it.  Cannot wait for series 4.
B005BGBPBG|4.0|3.5 stars<br /><br />I loved Emily Giffin's Something Borrowed (read my review here), so I was really looking forward to watching the movie adaptation.  I was most excited about John Krasinski, and when I saw that he was one of the main characters, I knew the $6.99 Video On Demand rental fee would be worth it.<br /><br />After watching the movie, I noticed on IMDB that Something Borrowed got poor ratings.  It may not have received critical acclaim, but I still enjoyed the movie.  I don't know if I'd ever want to watch it again (primarily because I just don't like Kate Hudson), but I did enjoy it and thought it was a good adaptation of an excellent book.<br /><br />Now let's talk casting for a minute.  I think that Ginnifer Goodwin was a perfect Rachel.  Kate Hudson embodied the selfish, flighty Darcy well, even though Darcy is a brunette in the book.  For some reason, that really bothered me...I felt like they should have darkened her hair for the movie.  Which makes me wonder, have you ever seen Kate Hudson as anything other than a blonde?  I haven't.  Colin Egglesfield was the perfect Dex.  He looks exactly how I pictured Dex as I read the book.  John Krasinski did a great job as Ethan and I think he was the best actor out of the group.<br /><br />One of my favorite things about book to movie adaptations is noticing differences between the book and the movie.  In fact, my husband recently had to ask me to please stop saying, &#34;That's NOT in the books&#34; when watching True Blood.  This was not a problem with Something Borrowed for two reasons: it stayed fairly true to the book (yay!) and I watched it alone.  My husband came home from work about halfway through, watched about 30 seconds of the movie, and hightailed it out of the room, saying he couldn't stomach any more.  There were definitely elements in the movie that were not in the book, but the main themes were the same and the ending was the same.  I have a really hard time when the ending is totally different between the two versions.<br /><br />Overall, I would recommend Something Borrowed to fans of chick flicks and fans of the book.  The book was definitely better than the movie, but the movie was still good.  If you do watch the movie, make sure to watch the credits all the way through.  There's a great little surprise scene at the end that sets up a &#34;To Be Continued...&#34;.erent between the two versions.<br /><br />Overall, I would recommend Something Borrowed to fans of chick flicks and fans of the book.

B006LSZECO|3.0|This was a fast read, as I was completely intrigued until the last 1/4th of the book. Then it just became too unrealistic, without much explanation about the events on the author's part. It felt like she burnt out, leaving the reader unsatisfied.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|I have been wanting to see The Help for months now but missed it at the movies.  Having absolutely loved the book, I felt sure that the movie adaptation would be just as good.  Read my review of the novel by Kathryn Stockett here.<br /><br />I watched The Help during my 11-month old's naptime, which meant that I watched it with subtitles to keep the volume down.  I think I got more out of the movie that way.  Some of the dialogue was difficult to understand, and watching with subtitles meant that I didn't miss a word.<br /><br />Of course, there were some changes from the book to the movie version, but they did not bother me too much.  I did feel like some of the important scenes were omitted from the movie, especially the part about Minnie and the miscarried baby.<br /><br />The casting was excellent and everyone did such a good job.  I especially loved Viola Davis as Abilene and Octavia Spencer as Minnie.  And Emma Stone is such a good little actress!  I have really enjoyed all of her movies to date.  Allison Janney was a perfect Mrs. Phelan and I thought her scenes were some of the movie's best.<br /><br />The movie adaptation was not as good as the book (which was just outstanding) but it was still a really good movie.  I enjoyed it a lot, and think just about anyone would like it.  It is a powerful movie that really makes you think about what it was like to live through the Civil Rights movement.
B004SIP7AS|3.0|I originally thought that this was a good version...until I read the book. I realized the story line in the movie did a terrible job of reenacting the real story. The acting was mediocre though Jeremy Northam does make a good Mr. Knightley. If you want to watch a really good reproduction of Emma check out the 2009 BBC one with Romola Garai and Johnny Lee Miller. It's pretty much superior in every way. The one thing I will say for this version is that it did have some pretty funny lines in it but I just found that it made the whole movie seem less serious and more silly. And not in a good way. It almost took away from the romance.<br />Please watch the 2009 version. It'll be more worth your while.
B00AHGSVKS|5.0|Just kidding. This is my favorite Clarke book of them all. It's vision was so far ahead of its time considering when it was written.
B00CUB5PNY|5.0|I  love this game! Its so much fun, even if you dont finish within the time limit, you still get to finish the level
B009N4QJ54|5.0|I've seen this movie several times and it's because of the quirky, fast-paced dialogue. It is hard to keep up with at times, but Robbins, Leigh & Newman pull it off in a fantastic way. Robbins' &#34;You know.. for kids !!!&#34; cracks me up every time.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Thanks for bringing this game to Kindle! I've certainly enjoyed it on other platforms and so far there is little discrepancy between versions.

B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Being in the 50+ crowd and reading Heroes, Percy Jackson (and also Harry Potter) may seem weird to some, but I will take these books over the classics any time. When you start these series, you are hooked and can't wait 'til the next one.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|The kids and I had fun finding items and solving the puzzles. Some of the puzzles are more challenging but none are so tough that they become frustrating. Wish this were longer it only took a little while to finish all ten levels.
B00BLGDFH2|5.0|be careful, songs on this disc will grow on you at an alarming rate.  Impressive, it has a varied style of music throughout the disc, but anyone who likes various music styles will enjoy most of the songs.
B00DU74U74|3.0|The book is better, the movie specially since it's hard to tell the characters apart due to the fact that they look a lot alike, leaves much to be desired.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|Never used yet, bought as a 'nice to have if I need it' app. It is the same thought process as having an alarm on your watch, - when do you use it?
B00CRWJ5GO|3.0|It's a long story to try to fit into a single movie, even at more than two hours, it is often confusing, with the flash forwards and backwards in time, it gets really hard to keep up sometimes.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Never used other than a quick test & it works well, I have it as a 'nice to have if needed'
B00CDT41RY|5.0|Absolutely memorable as most Tarantino films are. Often gut wrenching sometimes just nuts, but with situations, characters and dialogue you will not soon forget. I love it.

B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This is a lot of fun.  I would love it if you could get coins a little faster.  I definitely recommend this app.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I loved this book.  The writer kept the story interesting and you felt the true pain and agony of the parents.
B002BI6SMI|5.0|Very good movie. A father kicking ass to save his daughter. What's not to love? Liam Neeson is, of course brilliant. Great Luc Besson script. One of my favorite movies.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I loved this writers first two books.  I could not wait to read this book.  It is very disappointing.  To many characters introduced and to hard to follow how they tied into the story line.
B00DW2PDH8|5.0|First thing I want to comment on is the cover. It is captivating and I am one that a book will grab my attention based on the cover; if I like what I see, I investigate the book further and usually walk out of the bookstore with it. Whoever your designer is did a fabulous job!<br /><br />From start to finish Simon did a wonderful job writing this novel. His writing is sophisticated and descriptive. He truly did paint a picture in my head of the events occurring or the characters in the novel. From the very beginning, Eternal grabbed my attention and I felt happy, sad, scared and anxious with her. There was some momentary confusion in one part of the book that I was truly confused, but since the main character was too, that means this situation was depicted well.<br /><br />I was fascinated by the creativeness of the nurse and the orderly characters (will not give anything further away--don't want any spoilers)! The Count/Lucien's character is well written and developed enough to give you insight into the background of this character and what led him to the evil monstrosities he now deals out.<br /><br />Overall, as a book lover (particularly horror, supernatural, vampires) this was an interesting read and I can't wait to read more! It sure had its uniqueness and spin on vampires and the world in which they exist.
0425267695|5.0|Really enjoyed this read, Blood Songs is the kind of book you can lose yourself in for a day or two.
B004ADF7RO|4.0|I enjoyed the movie as a kid and as an adult.  My kids loved the action-filled flick and enjoyed some of the comical scenes, as well. This is an enjoyable film before the technology of computerized animation dominated the film industry.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|Not enough information on the front page. The map is terrible. The achievement point garbage is annoying. Just the the TV channel weather has become secondary.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Why did the weather channel change their app?  Really liked the old version, this new update is hard to read and confusing to navigate through. Time to uninstall!
B002WV5A9G|5.0|I was very impressed with the actors and how well they looked and acted like the original cast.  The young people really studied them and they were totally a younger version.  Good for them and us.
B00DD49R0E|4.0|When it comes to creating a movie that fits every age group, it is not easy!  \\"Despicable Me 2\\" has the right formula to be successful.<br /><br />Gru, the main character, transforms from the most evil villain to become a loving father of his three adopted daughters, and make a living of making jam.  He is more occupied with birthday parties.  Life is good, but not exciting.<br /><br />In this sequel, he is being recruited to detect the villain who has stolen a devastating toxin from the Arctic research center.  The toxin, if injected, would turn timid species into the most destructive monsters.  Gru now has a beautiful agent Judy as his partner.  The scene, when Judy kidnaps Gru to the underwater agent center, has some reminiscence of James Bond Movie (magic car, chase scene, car turns into water vehicles ...).  Judy is funny and combative, ready to destruct any suspicious items including a bunch of cupcakes.  The two starts with surveillance of the occupants in a shopping mall.  Very quickly, Gru narrows the target (Almacho), but could this be that a bias, as Almacho's son asks Gru's eldest daughter for a date?<br /><br />The three cute daughters add flavors to the movie.  The elder one is old enough to use the internet to look for dating services for Gru; and she herself has been attracted to Almacho's son in an unplanned encounter in the mall.  The youngest, hoping to have a mom, has been thrilled to see Gru's new partner Judy.  His minions continue to serve his master, they are capable, loyal and fun-loving - who doesn't want to have some at home?<br /><br />As the story progresses, the minions were injected the toxins which turned them into purple and ugly minis with spiky hair.  The climax comes as Gru was asked by Almacho to join him to rule the world with the purple monsters?  Would Gru be in?  How could he find the antidote to rescue his minions?  How would the partnership of Gru and Judy end?<br /><br />Gru is likeable, he is not handsome, he is bald, andhe is human - when he is love-struck, he is the best person; when he is disgruntled, his evil side re-appears.  Is it by design that he speaks non-American English - is his accent Russian, French or some middle east?  Even his genius assistant is speaking like British English.  If Superman represents all-perfect hero, Gru is definitely not but it makes an easier formula for plots.<br /><br />The movie is filled with light-hearted humor,good for all ages.  The story is simple, yet has some good surprises.  The characters, all unique, are impeccably designed.<br /><br />If you are looking for a family-friendly movie and heart-warming smile in an afternoon, this will be a very good choice.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|The Alien collection on Blu-ray, best way to get it!  I got a great deal on it.  Can't wait to re-watch all of them.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|wonderful I liked this product. this is a keeper. could watch this for years to come. history repeating itself.  knowledge
B001DM1VXE|1.0|Stupidly shot, stupidly written, I feel stupid for having watched it. Even if you have nothing else to do don't watch this abomination.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Great book.....amazing plot and characters. You think it's going in one direction and then it goes in another!!  Great ending and could have a sequel in the making. I want to know what happens to Camille!
0061950726|5.0|I found this to be a fascinating, well written novel.  The book is entertaining and instructive.  I had never heard of the orphan trains before even though they were a part of our country's social history for 75 years.  The stories of Molly and Vivian are vividly portrayed.  The author brings them to life through their stories.  I believe it to be one of the best books I've read this year and I do read many.
B000PMFTDQ|5.0|Miss Norman is like a 747, all contoll and power that can soars to heaven. When I play this CD, I can do nothing except sit and listen. I feel like God speaks through her stunning soprano voice.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Recommended to me by.a friend who said it was the best book she'd ever read and she was right.  I look forward to reading more books by Jojo Moyes.
B009ZQC7MY|3.0|This is not a &#34;guy&#34; flick.  Good for women who like that kind of thing. The scenery is good but the characters are too much of what they are-Upstairs/Downdstairs.
B001EBYMB2|5.0|Reviews, evidently, need to be 20 words long at least, but I don't feel that this movie needs any pretentiously verbose exposition. This is a movie that should be watched by anyone who appreciates history, sociology, or film making. And even if you don't care about any of those things...you should still watch it.
B0047SIXGE|4.0|I have seen this too many times but I still like to watch some of the scenes.  The Redux is good for the harsh reality of the situation.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This is my Grandsons favorite game(he is eight years old)...He is getting to be a pro at knowing when to push on the gas, let off the gas, or brake...He is also great at rolling over, LOL, but a couple of times he has been going just the right speed to roll all the way over...amazing...and just keeps on going...
B004EPYZQ2|5.0|Later I watched the movie and wondered WHY they wanted this movie!?  Good product.  Good price.  Scary movie.  Maybe the kids wanted it because we used to spend hours making home movies to entertain the kids.  Never again!!!  8-)
B008MIMWOO|5.0|I'm a big fan of Mike Myers and his movies, but never so much as the Austin Powers trilogies.  This is a &#34;timeless&#34; (a-thank you) classic that will always be in my heart.  Saw all 3 in theaters on my birthday (oddly enough when I turned 16,18, & 21) so how could I NOT get the 3 movie set!
0920668364|5.0|Very touching book.  Have read this for years, now buying copies to pass on to kids.  Read this a number of times in front of large groups.  Try this if you are BRAVE enough.  Starts out the crowd is laughing with you as you read it.  Then it gets quiet.  Then all you can hear are sobs and people blubbering.  NOW trying reading it in front of them when YOU know what is going to happen.  I dare ya!  You might find it live changing.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|This was one boring book. Nothing happens and it looks like nothing will. The book should have stopped at the wedding and that would have been that. Something about the way that these characters are written or behave makes me care very little about what happens to them. Its almost as if by throwing all these issues into the book, that you should be forced to like them, but I can't bring myself to care.  It was also repetitive and being that neither of these two Gideon nor Eva have a sense of humour its like going around and around on a very boring ride. The repeated phrases, the calling him ace, really? The I love you's at every other  moment as if it is a switch that must be pressed. I am glad Eva saw all this growth in Gideon's character and his outlook, for the life of me, he was the same supposedly gorgeous block of wood from the first book. So boring. zzzzzzzzzzzz
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|There is no better way to relax than to spend an evening watching back to back episodes of Downdon Abbey.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The show is amazing!!!  The show is perfectly casted and the writing is impeccable.  In my opinion, it is the best series on the tube!!!<br /><br />It is superbly well done!!!
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|All Star Cast from the actors on the screen to the directors, music, scenes, and the tiniest details that brought this magnificant piece of work to the screen.  If I could hand out awards, everybody who worked on this movie would get at least one!  It took a huge number of people with special talents to put this movie together.  It is a fitting tribute to a unique, gifted writer.  It is worth at least two viewings..fast moving and detailed...you could miss a lot with just one watching!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I love it.  Brings you back to simpler times when life snailed along rather than zoomed into infinity.  Definitely recommend this series.
0812984412|5.0|In the throes of whodunit, whereisit, and ohmygod..where are we now...comes a writing style and voice that grabs on and doesn't let go until after the last thought of it clears the reader's mind.  Amazing story-telling with some of the most beautiful language usage avaialbe in modern times.  I loved every minute of it, reading intently wtih one hand on the book, the other on my Webster's.<br />Adventures in consciousness have never been more elegantly shared.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|These lawyers work in one office, in THE city! Elegant, styliish and classy and professional. No swearing at all. Great TV series. Cannot wait for 3rd season to start.<br />Amazon prime HD quality is amazing!
B00BEXB18M|5.0|Happy 30th Megadeth! Even if you are not a Megadeth fan, this is a \\"must have\\" for your music library. Super Collider is pure heavy metal from first track to last. \\"Cold Sweat\\" left me wanting MORE! Kudos to Dave and the guys...
143911000X|3.0|Received book in obvious used state.<br /><br />I am not complaining though due to the great price and the BOOK IS A MUST HAVE. (unless you are a chick, then this book is non-existent)
B00B5ARKDE|5.0|Great package.  Loved the movie and the minifig.  UltraViolet a gamechanger.  With Amazon's great discounted price too!  So glad I got the Blu-Ray+DVD+UV combo.<br /><br />Bought it for my kids but ended up liking the movie myself.<br /><br />Highly Recommended.
1863514201|5.0|The author does a very good job with step by step directions. Also the projects graduate in difficulty a little giving you practice as you go and confidence in your skill developing.
B00CW665VI|5.0|I loved this book. At the beginning I was like :what??? Seriously??? But I loved it. I'm planning on reading it again some time. It is funny and romantic so just my type of book
B0050DIWFC|5.0|The book stays with you after it's completed.  Makes you thoughtful and reflective about how parents might respond in the face of horrendous acts committed by their child.  Also leaves you wondering if Jacob was guilty or if it was simply a string of coincidences.  Loved the book and will definitely read it again.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|for free birds, its great. pop ups are only slightly annoying, but what can you say, after all it's FREE
B006LSZECO|1.0|The ending was suited to the story.  They were both crazy and psychotic.  They deserve each other.  It was all I could do to finish the book and the best part was that it was done.
B009POHHR6|5.0|I loved it, great reading, fun, with a ton of food for thought. A welcome addition to the Superman alternative stories
B007UPNA6Y|5.0|And in just a few months I have read the entire story of the ex-military MP.  I am simply hooked, line, sinker and all...
B000HF6XKO|5.0|Great film. Everyone is at the top of their acting game. Story is tight and engaging-not to mention historical! a slam dunk!
B007TML4EI|5.0|This is a good app for Kindle.  requires lots of skill and it's a strategy game that's amazing for Kindle Fire's and amazon Kindle Fire's.get this app today
B00A0SLTCU|4.0|I've become used to reboots that are better or more relevant to today's sensibilities than the originals, but aside from more, let's call it \\"marketable\\" action, the old  one was better.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|Well written, but skips around and speeds up important events you don't know if &#34;you are coming or going&#34;. This actions prevents from building up character.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this season, I think it's the best yet! Be prepared for a few shocks along the way. As always the acting is supurb.
B000SGGUWS|5.0|Good book. After watching the television show for a while, I decided to check out the books. Couldn't put the book down and I am looking forward to reading the next book.
B005ZCXPP0|1.0|I waited an hour before deciding it wasn't worth another hour. Not a great superhero movie.For diehard superhero or marvel fans it is probably fine but since I don't watch that many, I thought it was pretty bad.(I enjoyed Iron Man movies, for example)
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Actually makes me think...can get frustrating but thts so much better than vein too easy..I like a challenge. So I set it down n come back with a fresh perspective and BAM! Usually get it...it's just stimulating &amp; fun! P.S. I'm a very tough critic...almost never give 5 *'s..this deserves it.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|really hadn't read any reviews of the Innocent before I read it.  I was caught off guard when he became attached to the young gnd ..was surprised when he devoted so much time helping her.  I was really suprised with the ending.  I really love it when I didn&#34;t<br />figure it out.<br />c
B004JZBGWI|5.0|Works well for everything I need in a note pad , shopping lists, to do lists. Love the color coding. Thank for a free and easy clean app.
B002NANLCE|5.0|I got this book because I enjoyed the TV show, but the book was so much better. I know the show was hoping for a longer time playing so lots of room for development and explanation was left, but I liked the way the book approached the story much better.
B00D6SBOWG|2.0|I played this on my daughters ipad and really liked it however when it became available for android and kindle I was disappointed.  I loaded it on my compatible android device and it would lock up my phone and I had to shut it completely down to get out of it.  It would not load on my kindle even though it is advertised for kindle.
B0034G4OYA|5.0|My daughter thinks that this is the greatest movie ever! She watches it non stop back to back! Every time she gets a little tired of being in the car we just put it on and she is great!
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|Really enjoy playing the game . It is fun to play. The different levels are fun. I would recommend it for everyone.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Way too short but definitely interesting.  I had to really think about some of the moves.  Enjoyed this game and it's challenges and just wish there had been more levels.
B0031RS4UM|4.0|Typical of Lee Child this book did not disappoint me. The plot was believable and not exagerated . I always look foreward to Childs new releases.
B00DGNO3WE|5.0|My husband and I loved this movie. It is funny, very well written and contains some great music. I have recommended it to several friends already.
B0044IABFS|4.0|I just discovered this series on Amazon Prime. It is addictive. The fourth season is exciting and my favorite characters return. Redemption and forgiveness run through the season as even the bad guys become valued team members. Heck, even Brad is respected.  Tired of worrying about Michael's headaches. Wondering if his head will explode before he and Sarah are able to live happily ever after.
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|Not for little tots but me and my wife enjoyed it with all the old retro video game characters and such.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Love this app. Very fun to play. The greatest bingo game of all time I believe. Love the bingo blitz and all I've played with.
B00DGMVJAO|3.0|It was an ok movie. I didnt fall asleep so i guess thats something. The movie is pretty unrealistic as it has a mix of cheap animation mixed in as well.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|super well made with a lot of extras to unlock so glad its now on my kindle fire a must have time waster
0307341577|5.0|I was very happy in receiving the book on a timely basis.  The book was absolutely fantastic and I highly recommend you read it.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Love this game.<br />Easy to play. Don't get bored with it. Need more ways to get coins and pearls. Great for kids or adults.
0307341550|5.0|I received this order timely and I look forward to reading it soon.  I read Gillian Flynn's other two books and I am sure that this one will be just as good.  I highly recommend you read her books if you enjoy a great mystery.  In my opinion, she is one of the best writers out there and ranks up there with the best.  I only hope that she starts writing more.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I really love the vidio I lost some wieght Ijust jillian she is awsome, I will be ready for my trip to playacar
B00CB4ET0K|4.0|this game is pretty sweet, it's got pretty good graphics and it's got easy controls, but all of the good guns cost glu points, which you need to pay for, but all in all, a good game!!
B005DF2QMC|4.0|It is okay...Quality was a bit below expectations but for the price, it is okay. Haven't tried it yet but did put a cassette in to play..did fine.
B00881VLCE|3.0|I really liked the color of the pictures but I had a hard time getting the puzzel pieces out of the bar
B008RYN44U|5.0|Love no doubt, need I say more? The beats are great.  Just wish there was a few more faster paced songs
B00AVFO41K|1.0|I did not understand at all how this game worked, very dissapointed How come there are no instructions for these games
B004ADH1RI|5.0|This movie even when it was released was an instant classic, as a child I loved the intrigue and drama of the group of misfit kids searching for one eyed Willy a legendary pirate who supposedly had a buried treasure.  The kids are challenged by a family of killers who are on their tail the whole time.  There is also a good bit of comedy throughout; this really is a film the whole family can enjoy.<br /><br />I shared this favorite with my kids who now love it as well!
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Facebook allows me to keep up with children, grandchildren and friends on a day to day basis. It is also very useful for hooking to other apps such as you tube.
B00000F169|4.0|Dark Star is a scout ship, presumably sent out ahead of Earth colonists in an effort to locate and destroy potentially unstable planets (why the colonists can't pick STABLE planets to live on isn't made clear). Dark Star has been in space for several years (its been 20 on Earth) and its systems are falling part and getting worn out) and its crew of five (counting the frozen commander) are showing signs of fatigue. The computer, with its Marilyn Monroe voice, tries to keep things working during the mission.<br /><br />This is a funny movie and I remember seeing it as a kid. Back then the special effects were impressive but now they're a bit cheesy. The acting isn't the greatest (I still haven't figured out if SGT Pinback wasn't really SGT Pinback, as he claimed, or was it just an effort to start a conversation?) but it's a fun movie. I'd watch it again!
B0044DEAUA|5.0|Needing bluetooth in the car, I followed the recommendations and purchased the SuperTooth. Excellent choice. It took mere moments to connect with the phone and has a clip that securely fits to the visor, while the speaker attaches firmly to the clip with a rather sturdy magnet. A nice added convenience. The phone quality - according to all I have asked - is very good, and I don't need to yell over the car noise. It also has voice dialing so there is no need to even pick up the handset. It's a value at this price, but certainly the features make it worth more than the cost.
B0026772N8|4.0|I haven't read this book for quite sometime, now that I'm older it reads differently, better, I recommend this book, but it is not a light read
B0045HCJQW|5.0|this movie doesn't need any reviews. It's perfection from beginning to end. This is the third time i've purchased it, my others having either worn out or become obsolete (VHS)
193700788X|1.0|&#34;Dead Ever After &#34; is DOA. Save your money.  The book is a very slow, boring read.  Really a disappointment after enjoying the beginning of the series.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|love this gameeeeeeeee it is very very very very cool guys u should get it I think everyone should get it
030789701X|5.0|Longer than Atlas Shrugged, this guide covers absolutely everything you could want in Skyrim. The index makes it easy to navigate and the place-holders are a nice helping touch.
B00594XOZU|5.0|Kik me if you make mermaid tails or if you want to be in my mermaid club on YouTube my kik cottenbluecandy
B000002OTL|4.0|...but, I have missed out on listening to this awesome CD because I didn't want my children to hear the dialogue at the beginning and I didn't want to hear it again, either.  Very seldom do I watch a movie and say \\"that would be a really good soundtrack to listen to\\" and then make it a point to go out and buy it.  I was so disappointed when I put in the CD and had to listen to the language that I overlooked in the movie, but was blatant in audio only. Unfortunately, this one sits on the shelf. :/ I think I'll dust it off and hit skip.
1781162646|5.0|Stephen king does it again! Joyland was one his best i think. He is really good with the mysterious! Always a page turner! I couldn't stop til i was finished! I would recommend this book for anyone who like Stephen king
B0088W7VNG|5.0|Every Stargate series I've watched, and I've watched them all, have become my all time favorites. the only stargate episodes I dont like are season 9 and up from SG1. Ben Browder and Claudia Black from Farscape joined the SGC and  ruined it for me.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Bought the Samsung Galaxy 10 7&#34;, I like the Kindle reader interface better and I  now have linked my account to my new pad device.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I used to play this all the time 15 years ago and I love finding the original version again. Thank you for offering it!
B00518HBD0|5.0|I haven't purchased a 3 Doors Down in a long time.  I am not sure why.  I am so glad I got this one!  I love it!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game is fun yet kind of a challenge too. It is a great way to waste time when you're waiting or just looking to keep busy with something.
B008JFUQZ2|4.0|I just saw this on the big screen in 3-D and was very pleased.  It was much better than I expected and was accompanied by big clanging and banging sounds as the robots fought against the creaming alien creatures.  The movie was pretty much non-stop battle action.<br /><br />The robots and aliens are all massive in size.  The robots are controlled and fought by 2 people, synching up the right and left hemispheres of their brain, suiting up, and moving and smashing.  Of course, there are two analytical scientists in the background and a little bit of personal-life discussions.  But the movie is mostly clang and bang and pretty entertaining, especially on the big screen.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|My toddler loves watching me play this game, it is very fun. I only wish it was a bit more descriptive on how to use weapons and achieve goals.
B0087ZG7UW|5.0|Psycho was the first scary moving that I had seen.  In 1960, I was in the 10th grade and this movie scarred me for life.  I was thrilled to be able to have my own copy of the DVD.  It was in excellent quality and delivered in only two days.  Thanks, for the service.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|It a really good game all around (p.s. a lot of people say there is a money losing glitch, but they lose money from buying supply crates, which cost 5000 gold
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|This game met my expectations.  It has great graphics, an interesting storyline, and is great fun to play. It was very enjoyable. I would recommend it to others.
B001PJRAUS|5.0|I loved this movie! I am a huge Pride and Prejudice fan and wasn't sure I would like a spin-off. I ended up loving it, especially the end!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game so much I play it all the time with my friends. The version I'm playing is 0.7.1 and 0.7.2 just came out. Please update it. Minecraft is very important to me becaise I'm going to make a youtube account called PDM nation and it's going to be all about minecraft.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Finally finished the third book in the trilogy!!! Ecstatic that Peeta survived and disgusted that Prim did not ;0????? Prim is the only reason why Katniss volunteered for the Hunger Games in the first place!!!!!!!  If she was going to die anyway they should of just let  her become a tribute and died  during the Hunger Games. All of the tributes should ''ve refused to participate in the games. That's the way I would have written it......
B0026Q8EWW|4.0|Great cast, great story... if you've been hooked by John Grisham's writing, you'll enjoy this film! His books make for wonderful viewing. Well done!
B0074QGGK6|5.0|This is a nice book about the reality of the creative process. This book will help you relax and realize there is a simple process for creating good content.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|This book brings to life a period in time with which we are familiar, yet which always has had an unreal, almost surreal quality to it.  I'm ready for more!
B007JGAR6U|4.0|Looks great with the X-pro1 and X-E1 (probably the only bodies from a look standpoint with the upcoming X-M1).  Performance is good, recharge speed is snail mail slow if flash is used at max firing (will eat up your AAA rapidly...), otherwise bulb recharge cycle time under fractional firing is fine.  Pricey mostly due to its styling and size.
B00ANA27IU|5.0|Great book if you like action and adventure and through out the whole book you are on the edge of your seat
B005HED11Y|5.0|I first saw this series in syndication back in the 70's, on my old black and white TV, so it is a real treat to see it in color.  Of course, you need some imagination to get past the papier-mache \\"rocks\\" on alien planets.  Special effects weren't too sophisticated in those days!<br /><br />That said, the plots are just as much fun, and sometimes psychologically intense, now as they were then.  My husband, who was too intellectual for this show when it first came out, is really into it now.  I've turned him into a Trekkie!<br /><br />I only wish that, in general, they would get this streaming technology down.  It was worse on Netflix than on Amazon Prime, but it's terrible when the frame freezes right when the alien is emerging from the human!
B0050DZN4K|5.0|I was not a huge fan of Blogger and I was desperate to find a way to keep up with my blogs once google reader was shut down. Feedly is a wonderful way to keep my blogs organized. I love it!

B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|It was spellbinding.  I Loved it.  It is completely engrossing.  I'm ready for the sequel!  Where do I sign up?
B004EBZX6W|3.0|Other than the different views you can see of the wifi signal strengths, I don't understand what else this app does.  That's my review for this app.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Full of fun puzzles that are challenging but not so difficult that you want to rage quit. A nice balance. You just want to solve one more room.
1579124585|5.0|This story easily entered my Top 5 books within the first 2 chapters. It only grew from there. Wolfe's style, pacing, and his narrative voice demonstrate an extraordinary gift of storytelling surpassing many past and present peers.  That narrator voice is pretty unique in writing - conversational and familiar, sharp and analytical, a bit of the South in it...<br /><br />Wolfe was not afraid to let his own opinions show (which I guess was the critical component of \\"New Journalism\\") but he doesn't attempt to pass opinions as facts aka John Reed, et al. You know it's a person telling it as they see it with the resulting knowledge that you know where they're coming from. Additionally, when he's relating how a witness perceived an event, it is still in the narrative voice, rather than adopting the voice of the person who used it. In many ways, this could have been a disastrous approach, but it works. You feel this is a guy telling you a story.<br /><br />There was hilarity on most pages, even in the morbid statistics. I loved the portions on the chimps. You really felt for Ham and Enos and the tortures they endured. The worse the picture became, the more Wolfe ratcheted up the wide-eyed, can-you-believe-this-crap comedy.
0525478817|5.0|One of my high school students suggested this book.  I bought her one for a graduation present and one for myself.  After reading through it in 2 days and left with smiles and tears I have to say it is an outstanding book.  Very well written and a great perspective through the eyes of a child with cancer.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I didn't know there was really a train and program like this.  We drive through Concordia KS at least twice a year and didn't know of the museum there either.  Glad I read the book.

B00CLD65X0|5.0|After hearing from friends about this show, I really wanted to see it and, therefore, was delighted to be able to view it on my Kindle.  I thought the acting was great with a really good story line.  In fact, I couldn't wait to see the next episode.
B004XUMMFE|4.0|I was hesitant to begin this series as it is already off the air, but now as I have, I understand why it was so loved.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I absolutely love this series!  Best show I have watched in a long time. Beats all the reality shows on TV
B002N44XSG|3.0|There were some fun stories and pictures which I enjoyed, but it was pretty short and not worth the money.
B00CXN2JNS|4.0|Regardless of what hot rod thinks he knows, this is one of their better albums in years, as a drummer myself, I can't stand speed drumming, it goes to show that whoever does it doesn't really have the talent for actual rhythm. This latest album doesn't have much of that nonsense.
B002O3Z4Y8|5.0|Omg! I'm so glad I found this movie. I saw it on cable tv once and could not remember the name of it until recently. Great movie about kids being kids playing jokes and games until someone gets hurt and their lives are forever changed. Great movie about the juvenile justice system and the inhumane treatment that can occur,and a great movie about an eye for an eye street justice style. Great actors
B00957T6X6|4.0|The first time I opened up the books it automatically opened to the first chapter of the fifth book. I assumed that it would open up to the first chapter of the first book and began reading. I realized shortly into the first chapter, but I still learned a few things that I shouldn't know yet. Anyway, the books are great, just be sure to double check that you're starting where you want before you begin reading.
B00499QUK2|5.0|A new Sherlock for the times.  Love this guy who texts and uses the internet to help solve the mystery.  The two stars work well together to create that Holmes/Watson pairing.  I am a huge Sherlock Holmes Fan so I'm happy to see him back.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|My wife and have read all of the James Rollins books and especially look forward to any extensions to the Sigma Force adventures.  I guess you can say we have connected with the characters. There's enough romance to keep her happy and plenty of action for me.  We especially like having the adventures tie history and science together.  I also like the what's fact section at the end.  Thanks!
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|Unfortunately this takes so long to load and reload after each run that my grandaughters lose interest.  Plus the continual face book and buy buy buy stuff just ruins it.
0553565915|5.0|This book was such an inspiration to me when I first read it back when it was first published, it led to my redidication of my life to God.  I have &#34;loaned&#34; many, many copies through the years, and some had my permission to keep. I've also given away more than a few.  I have read it over and over again periodically, and continue to be inspired.  My DAILY reading is Scripture, both old and new testaments, along with daily prayer.  But uplifting and inspirational readings also deepen and strengthen my walk with Christ.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Love this game so addicting and fun. can't wait to do more levels. So I am writing this review. See ya.
B00BCK1A5G|5.0|Wow, well what a story! this is such a great read. great story line that resolves some major plot points, an subtly leaves a whole lot more open and we dont hate the author for it at all :) I was prepared not to like Kaleb, but ended up so much in love with him and his quest for his lost and only love. The Psy books just keep getting better and better, which is a very rare thing.
B004EF65QA|5.0|Loved the series but only could find one season on Prime. Would like to see the rest.<br />I would recommend this movie.<br />Keep in mind it's Ireland but very good story.
B00DBSZJRM|3.0|Not bad if you're looking to kill a couple of hours and this is all that you can find to watch.
B007QPFGJW|4.0|I really like Jo Nesbo's thrillers, and 'Phantom' is no exception. The author has a knack for building suspense and limiting unnecessary fluff so that the pace doesn't get bogged down. Harry Hole is about as flawed a character as they come--any more flawed, and I might not care about him. But Nesbo gives the ex-cop enough positive traits to make you root for him, especially his loyalty to his loved ones and his driving need for justice, even at his own peril.<br /><br />Nesbo captures the drug world of Oslo, a world I know nothing about, and yet from his descriptions, I felt as though I were there. He does a great job of planting clues and foreshadowing that you didn't realize were significant until after the fact. The reason I gave the four stars instead of five stars is because at times, the writing seemed choppy--which might have been due to translation problems--and because part of the story is told from the viewpoint of a dead man. That isn't a spoiler since the first chapter is in the voice of this dying character. It seemed a bit of a shortcut to narrate from this perspective, and I found myself not as interested in those passages. I preferred the passages by characters in the here and now.<br /><br />But all in all, a good read. I look forward to going back to the first Harry Hole novel, 'The Bat,' now that it's been translated to English.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|What an entertaining series!<br /><br />If you have an ounce of nerd in you, you will LOVE this show! :-) It is witty, well acted, and so endearing! Each season gets better and better!!
B0092SQ5EG|5.0|I had wanted to see this movie when it first came out, but didn't get the chance. She seems to be a woman with drive and determination! She followed her dreams! She stayed true to Katy! Inspirational to both the young and the young at heart! Keep the fireworks on display!!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Just right for those calculations that do not require a complicated formula. Worth getting. I use it for everyday problems that I can't solve in my head.
B00CWVM1AC|4.0|Yossi painstakingly reveals the depths of emotional attachment,  with a hefty dose of reality.  The content is believable and the acting supurb!  It's somewhat dark and slow starting out, but the sun eventially breaks through the clouds!  Highly recommended film!
1439156816|5.0|I enjoyed learning more about Steven King's personal history, very impressive that he has worked so hard. The guidance is more relevant for me instead of the dry, dull &#34;masters&#34; of the craft. Since King is so successful this book was my first choice.
B001B6PBBK|5.0|Pure entertainment, funny, often silly, touching and perfect for a chick flick night.  Made me wish I were 25 again.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|Love all episodes from the classic especially Daleks!! Some people can't get past traditional SC-FI this actually roots on the cheesy but it has sound research going in to it with great plots within plots.
B008VVT51U|5.0|Funny and whimsical but a &#34;message&#34; underneath it all.  Thoroughly enjoyed it.  Excellent cast of course the scenery is gorgeous.
6305076995|5.0|Excellent product...excellent music! I have had no problems with this item at all! Purchased as a backup to old album from 1970s. Listen to it everyday.
B002BVQU5A|5.0|Cult movie.  Takes me back to when I first saw this.  Very early Depp at this quirkiest.  Worth seeing especially if you're a Depp fan.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Great game and is completely free. Great way to kill time and create something you created yourself. Thanks and will continue playing.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Fun game to waste time....Don't need to pay to play! Not hard to play either. My five year old likes to play this game too!
B00BNGFGIQ|1.0|A game of this type over 50mb? I have an unlimited data plan but can't use it to dl this game because of Amazon's artificial limit. So I can't really review the game. I wish I could.<br /><br />I could use my wifi? Yes i could but why is the game over 50mb?
B008Y6W5SM|5.0|There are so many reasons to love this moving especially if you were young during the 80's! Although very campy, it had very good effects for its time.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I can't express enough how great this book is! There are so many twists and turns. I finished it in less than 10 hours since I couldn't put it down!!
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Works great and I liked the feel of it. The quality of it was great. I'd buy it again. x
B00BH0VSM6|5.0|Couldn't put this book down. Great story and great characters. No one writes suspense as well as Jo Nesbo. I highly recommend this book...
B0060MYM7O|5.0|The second season diverges more from the books than did the first, but stays entirely faithful to the tone.<br /><br />Still the finest fantasy television has ever known, and high on the list regardless of genre.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I'm half way through the 30 day program and have lost 6 pounds. I'm 5'10 and started at 190lbs. The exercises are challenging at first but get easier with time. Its just shy of 28 minutes from start to finish on each level. I think this is the first dvd Jillian Michaels put out. I've seen a few clips of her newer dvds and you can tell the production budgets have grown as well as her head and ego. I recommend this to anyone who hasn't worked out regularly (or at all) for some time. The two other chicks in this one are nice too.
B004U8VWLE|5.0|Aronofsky is not a subtle director. But there were multiple star turns in this gripping movie -- I think Barbara Hershey would have warranted a Supporting nod in any other year -- and it was, simply put, gorgeous. The art direction and cinematography used a very clean palette. Almost everything was black, white, or pink, or green in the background, with the occasional striking red.
B00B0X4PIO|3.0|I was a little disappointed in this book. It was not as good as his other two. I felt it was a bit disjointed and did not flow, it went from one thing to another without explanation..I enjoyed the other two very much and because of this I read the third book.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|I thought this was a fine reboot, story-wise. I think the very different career path and personality for Kirk vs TOS alienates a lot of viewers, and I found it a bit hard to swallow. Otherwise, the updates of the characters generally balance respect versus the original with the new approach. And Karl Urban does a superb job as Bones -- the least changed of the major characters.
B006VJMZXY|3.0|I enjoyed it but not as much as Phillipa Gregorys other books on this subject. I have read most of them and enjoyed a good many of them some more than others. This one did not do it for me.
B000NHPCS0|5.0|Another fine Scorsese entry in crime noir. A cascade from a couple of original flawed decisions. Then blood and death.
B009VIZDLI|3.0|I thought this book a bit silly. Would anyone go looking for a partner like this? I must admit I had a laugh in some parts. I wouldnt really recommend it.
B00ARPMIJE|5.0|A French girl in new York, was an extremely good read.<br />It had a clear and concise plot, which was easy to follow and detailed enough for the reader to imagine them selves into the story. I will personally confess to have fallen in love with Matt my self. It was so well written, I was able to feel all of Maude's emotions as if they were my own, and that is exactly what every writer should always aim for.<br />I highly recommend this book, and look forward to the sequel !
B00CLD65X0|5.0|Such an intriguing time period. Acting is suberb, costuming is wonderful.I cannot wait for Season 4!!.Was so sad to have it end. I will watch Downton Abbey in it'e entirety again!!
B008OOYALE|3.0|I loved this app this and dragon village (this is way better) I checked them 3 times a day but are litterally impossible to get diamond dragons unless u but and the person that they set u up with in the beginning is a computer and if u are a kindle fire player you will never get a good update it ticks me u decide if this is good or not this is onlymy opinion
B00DHKKN6Q|3.0|Hate having to buy coins<br /> But other than that this game is relaxing when I have a lot on my mind.
B004DHUAZQ|4.0|I find the banter between Stallone and Statham very entertaining. To me it really makes the movie! Non=stop action doesn't hurt either...
