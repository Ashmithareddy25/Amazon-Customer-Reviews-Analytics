B000002H97|4.0|History: <br />Metallica's original bassist died when the tour bus crashed sometime in the mid 80's.  His name was Cliff Burton and if you read about him, you will probably conclude that he had crazy ideas like putting melody in music and actually singing (he might have even had an idea to combine a metal band with an orchestra).   <br /> <br />Notes: <br />The sound quality of this album is superior to earlier albums (recorded digitally i suppose).   <br />The band's style changed most drastically on this album (see above). <br />I think people who like this album will like Reload and visa versa.
B000GDH9J6|5.0|My wife and I saw Kekexili at the 2005 Sundance Film Festival, and both loved the movie.  It reminds me of \\"Touching the Void\\", with its real life dramatic story retold on the screen.  It's the true story of a wildlife war on the remote Tibetan highlands, where local villagers mounted their own patrols as game wardens to save the vanishing Tibetan antelope.  In the mid 1990s, the unique species was hunted for its pelts (to be sold to Western furriers) to near extinction, and local patrols fought battles with poachers using automatic rifles in jeeps while dealing with lands devoid of roads, altitudes over 20,000 feet, quicksand, and extremes of weather to save it.  A city reporter goes out to these remote lands to investigate rumors of the antelope wars, and when the story finally gets told in the Beijing papers, it helps spark countrywide interest and support that has led to a turn around in herd numbers in the last 10 years. <br /> <br />The director travelled out to the Tibetan highlands and lived with the local tribesman for a year to gain their trust and learn the story of their battles.  He then used them as actors to tell their story, travelling 4 hours each way every day from the nearest town to filming locations!  The acting was excellent - I have a hard time believing they had no acting experience, but the director cites the Tibetan culture of night-time storytelling as a possible reason why they could act so well their first time on screen.  Anyway, the story is compelling; the scenery unbelievably vast, gorgeous and harsh; and the acting well done. <br /> <br />A wonderful movie I highly recommend.  I've been hoping the DVD would get picked up by an English-language distribitor for over a year so my friends and family can see it!
B0002W18MU|5.0|This is the introspective Johnny Cash work that I love, <br />more than his first popular recordings. <br />Deep, thoughtful, and the book that goes along with the <br />American V is deep, good reading with explanation. <br /> <br />I now have the whole set of American recordings.

B0002OERI0|3.0|I have to admit that I didn't buy this album at all. I actually borrowed it from a friend. She said I might like this album since I like Green Day. So I decided to give it a listen. When I did, I couldn't help to moan and groan because the album was not what I expected. Sure Green Day has 'matured' over the years but not for the best. This album was very terrible and the only songs worth listening to is 'St. Jimmy'. That was probably the only song on this whole album I found decent enough. Maybe that's why I gave this album 3 1/2 stars. The other songs such as 'American Idiot' or 'Holiday' just sicken me to my backbone because of the hype around it. Too much radio play, air play and everything else. Green Day should've just stopped after the album 'Warning' because that's what forced this album to come out. Those of you who are a fan of old Green Day. Re-play the old 'Dookie' album you have in your closet and remember those days when Green Day was good. If you are a fan of this album and like some of the songs on here, just download off Limewire if you already haven't. It's not worth it, to screw off your money on this album
B0002VKZL6|5.0|Mark Knopfler is like a fine wine: Unappreciated by children.   <br /> <br />Mr. Knopfler writes songs that examine the deeper things of life; relationships and character of individuals that are often overlooked by self-seeking people.   <br /> <br />The music that comes out of Mark Knopfler's heart is music that the majority of listeners overlook in their haste for a quick fix, for the instant feel-good rush.  His music is characterized by calm, quiet textures that take time to sink in, but when they do, they touch your soul deeper than almost any other recording artist out there.   <br /> <br />It takes a few listens to begin to gather what he talks about as he sings.  It takes many times through to fully understand what he is saying.  And no matter how many times you hear his words, you learn something new each time. <br /> <br />Music like this is wasted on the shallow and obtuse.  For grown people, Mark Knopfler is like cool water on a hot afternoon in the sun.

It should be interesting having this book in spanish for many people lacking the most elemental knowledge about their own history.<br /><br />It should have been interesting too having the opinion of Orwell himself about his own experience when he wrote \\"1984\\" or \\"Animal Farm\\".

B00000K3CR|5.0|Josh Baskin is a 13 year old boy (David Moscow), suffering from the inequities of being too young and small to have any control in his life. The girl he crushes on is dating a bigger, older boy and he can't even get on a carnival ride because he doesn't reach the minimum required height. He chances upon Zoltar, a spooky fortune telling machine, and impulsively wishes he were big. The wish is granted and Josh wakes up the next morning transformed into a 30 year old man (Tom Hanks).<br /><br />But, to bastardize Stan Lee's famous line, with a \\"big\\" body comes big responsibility. Josh manages to luck into a highly ranked position at a toy company and even cluelessly ends up with a hot girlfriend (the very grown up Elizabeth Perkins). With only his 13 year-old best friend Billy as a confidant, Josh must navigate thru the minefield of burdens and hangups (eking out a livelihood, the pressure and jealousies in the work area, adult relationships, etc) normally associated with growing up. Josh, thru the course of the film, comes to realize he isn't ready to be a grown-up and that being a kid is actually a pretty cool thing to be. Now, if he could only find that dang fortune telling machine.<br /><br />Tom Hanks delightfully channels his inner kid in this modern fairy tale. I really can't think of anyone else who could've been as convincing and charming as Hanks in portraying a grown-up with the mind of an adolescent. Elizabeth Perkins, as the very poised but baffled Susan Lawrence, effectively plays her role as initially calculating but, by the film's closing scenes, she'll end up tugging at your heartstrings. Robert Loggia, as Mr. MacMillan, the elderly but young-at-heart owner and head honcho of the MacMillan Toys Company, is disarming and infectious (in the good sense, not in the sense that he'll give you a disease). Everyone touts the \\"Chopsticks\\" scene with Loggia and Hanks as a classic standout of the film.<br /><br />Big ties with A League of Their Own as Penny Marshall's best directing effort. There's a reason Big made Marshall the first female director to surpass $100 million in the box office. She not only elicits very nice performances from her cast but she also injects into her film wholesome humor and warmth, a tastefully done romantic arc, and an insightful perspective about what it's like to be mired in adulthood and how, sometimes, we grownups are all either just going thru the motions or taking life too seriously.<br /><br />The only thing I found disquieting is the kidnapping subplot, which introduces a jarring element and clashes with the overall gentle tone of the film. The script handles it as discreetly and as \\"kid-gloves\\" as possible, but one can't help but empathize with the mostly off-screen grieving mother. And that's my only quibble.<br /><br />If you enjoy this film, I recommend 13 Going on 30 (Jennifer Garner is almost as good as Hanks), if you haven't seen it yet. And if you like Elizabeth Perkins, check out the romantic comedy He Said, She Said, where Ms. Perkins has never been better.all's best directing effort.

B00005JKHP|5.0|For the first half of this movie, I was so bored that I considered turning it off.  But when the second half rolled around, this quickly became one of the best movies I've ever seen.  Vger is an amazing character, and one of the best villans in the whole franchise.  He can't beat Khan or Nomad, but who can? The only issues I have with this movie are that, for most of the movie, it feels and looks more like Star Wars than Star Trek.  I imagine this is because Gene Rodenberry was jelous of Star Wars.  What he didn't realize was that he didn't need to be.  Star Trek is much better than Star Wars in my humble opinion.  Also, the first time we see McCoy he looks absolutely ridiculous!
B000002U82|5.0|Everyone must at least hear this album once in order to consider themselves a fan of music. Nuff said.
B000002JSN|5.0|Well....I guess everybody DOES have their own opinions----and Lord knows I've \\"smattered\\" enough of mine around within the context of my reviews here at Amazon. I've finally felt compelled to write a review for my personal favorite band, and quite possibly my all-time favorite Album (right next to \\"Abbey Road\\" and \\"Who's Next\\"). However, after reading through more than a few reviews here---- some VERY comprehensive, I decided that most of my comments would end up sounding very redundant. So with that said, maybe I'll throw some of the aforementioned \\"opinions\\" around.... <br /> <br />    To me, this (and every other LZ) release embodies everything I know to be a GREAT Album,...by a GREAT band. When I say GREAT album, I mean a release that has a varied mix of songs...though still remaining cohesive; musicians that play for the songs----songs that play for the musicians; and 'Good Time' music that never becomes \\"dated-sounding\\" for me. Led Zeppelin is among a VERY ELITE crowd as far as I'm concerned....in that, I can't imagine this band with ANY other than these four men----each member as equal as the next. The above said \\"elite\\" would include bands such as The Beatles, The Who, Rush, and possibly KISS and Van Halen as well. And as known,  some of these bands were able to \\"trudge\\" on with different members....however, when it was announced that the Mighty Zep would not continue after the death of the GREAT John Bonham, it was none too shocking for me. That is quite a testament to the \\"Brotherhood\\" of a great band----and in the case of the three remaining members, felt they needed to morally do the right thing and \\"call it a day\\" for their 'Fallen Comrade'.  <br /> <br />     Led Zeppelin WILL be remembered as long as Rock and Roll exsists...and the music heard on \\"Physical Graffiti\\" is a Major reason why. Every song offers the listener something different and special----- My favorites?......that's like picking your favorite Child! However, if pressed I would pick \\"InMy Time of Dying\\", \\"Kashmir\\", \\"Trampled Under Foot\\", \\"Houses of the Holy\\", \\"The Wanton Song\\" and \\"In the Light\\". I would strongly recommend this piece of musical Art to anyone not familiar with this legendary band, as well as any and all releases by them. In conclusion (and at the possible cost of many \\"Not Helpful\\" votes cast against me)..... If ever stranded on a desert island, I would take this over \\"Tommy\\", \\"The Wall\\" and \\"White Album\\" any day of the week....or month.....or YEAR. One of The BEST ever recorded-----BUY NOW!
B000AY807Q|5.0|After listening to this album, one can definitely hear that Neil Young has turned a corner in his life.  Great listening, and the quality of the recording on the dvd is outstanding.
B000002OR4|5.0|Music, where would we be without it?  Honestly, I do not know. I do know that music, for me, succeeds in communicating what words often times fail to express. Music often picks up where words fail, or music at least deepens the meaning of words already used. But can words deepen the meaning of music? Words, I think, can at least illuminate the meaning of music; whether they can deepen the meaning of music, I don't know. I will  simply try to illuminate. <br /> <br />Others have used so many appropriate and excellent words to describe the effect, or meaning, of the  Schindler score. The theme song will immediately intoxicate you with its simplicity and slow repetitiveness. Many of the other songs are alike, specifically \\"Remembrances.\\"  <br /> <br />I cried when, in the movie, Schindler realizes he could have saved more lives. I released many tears when he looks at his gold ring and mutters something about it being worth enough to buy one more life. Nearly every one of these songs has the power to draw such tears. You must understand that playing this music will tug, nay wrench, your inner cords of tenderness and sorrow. <br /> <br />Above all, this music softened my heart and awoke my mind to the brutality and inhumanity suffered by the Jews. This music can  refresh an affection for all the lives lost, especially when time itself inevitably makes our hearts cold to those atrocities that really happened. <br /> <br />
B000F3AAUW|4.0|From start to finish this album is original and should be the best album of 2006. The sad part is the that none of my friend are open minded enough to truly understand the greatness of St. Elsewhere. My favorite track are Who Cares?, Transfomer, And the hidden meaning of Necromancing. So overall the masterful producion of Dangermouse and the smooth, soulful,and sometimes creepy voice of Cee-lo Green come together in near perfect harmony. <br /> <br />Also I have read a review that basiclly bashes the track Necromancing, I wouldn't can it a review. She did make some good points but IT IS ONLY MUSIC!!! If all music was the way the artist feel truly half the artist out now would be in prison. The truth is that the talk of death and suicide in the song are metaphores. The song tells of how the woman in the relationship leaves him ending what once was good ergo Suicide. This is nothing more then a different take on what everyone has gone through a failed relationship, and expressing it differently. <br /> <br />
B0000YEEHG|3.0|This movie represents Bergman's expeimentation with different topics within film making, is an interesting item to have if you are interested in non classic hollywood movies.
B000FS9FCQ|5.0|The most important thing about the movie is that all you need to know is in it.  You just have to be able to sort it out to understand it. <br /> <br />Do we praise the character 'V' for his actions?  Would we cheer for the actions of a real person who takes such measures?  And would our answers be different if our government controlled the media and launched terror against our own citizens?  Would we be willing to stand against our government if it did?  I tend to think these questions are the ones that the movie makers want us to ponder upon.  They've succeeded quite well, from my point of view.  Mind you, its not a direct adaptation from the graphic novel. <br /> <br />The extras are very good on the disks. <br /> <br />All-in-all, well worth owning.  My highest rating for a movie.
B000FVBLEI|5.0|All That Remains previous album, \\"this darkened heart\\" should have unleashed these guys to a larger audience, breaking them out for good, once and for all. But, things dont always go as they should, and that release went over a lot of should-have-been fan's heads. But now, Phil Labonte (ex-Shadows Fall) and the boys are back, with an album that CANNOT be missed <br /> Picking up pretty much where \\"This Darkened Heart\\" left off, this album is as heavy as weapons grade plutonium. Phil sounds in as good as shape as he ever has, and he excerscises his clean vocal abilities a lot more on this album, which I say is a good thing, even though his clean vocals are on a little bit of the whin side for me, but still good. Check this album out instead of his old band's new one. You will enjoy it A LOT more.

B000B8I8X2|3.0|When it comes to heavy metal, no label can hold a candle (or maybe it's a lighter) to Roadrunner Records. One of the few independent labels of any size still left in an increasingly mega-corporate music world, Roadrunner is responsible for bringing the world such genre heavyweights as Fear Factory, Sepultura, King Diamond, Type O Negative, Machine Head, Opeth, Chimaira, Killswitch Engage, and of course Slipknot. In celebration of their 25th anniversary, rather than release a been-there-done-that boxed set, the Roadrunner brass came up with a rather novel idea, one that could only be accomplished in this era of digital recording: select four of Roadrunner's best-known musicians to be \\"Team Captains,\\" ask each to write and produce four or five new songs, and perform them not with their own bands, but with cherry-picked \\"supergroups\\" of musicians, chosen by each captain, from the cabal of Roadrunner artists past and present.      The four chosen captains--Dino Cazares (Fear Factory), Robert Flynn (Machine Head), Matthew Heafy (Trivium), and Joey Jordison (Slipknot)--have produced a total of 18 tracks featuring 55 musicians, and the results are pretty much what you would expect them to be: VERY loud, chaotic, and uneven. Some of the tracks are solid pieces of metal: Team Cazares' \\"The Enemy\\" and \\"Baptized in the Redeption,\\"  and Team Flynn's \\"The Rich Man\\" (anti-war song; you have been warned) and \\"The Dagger\\" (featuring the always superb Howard Jones of Killswitch Engage) are particularly good. But many of the songs sound like the musicians are trying too hard to out-shred each other, while their producers/captains are trying too hard to give each player his day in the sun, and blend the music they wrote with lyrics, penned by the singers who perform them, that don't always mesh. Team Captain Jordison is particularly guilty in this regard, and also of trying to cover too many musical bases, using his five tracks for ventures into death metal (\\"Annihilation by the Handof God\\"), straight-up thrash (\\"Constitution Down\\"), emo punk (\\"No Way Out\\"), melodic hard rock (\\"Tired `N Lonely\\") and goth (\\"Enemy Of The State\\").  Sticking to just one or two styles might have yielded better results.     There are also questions about selection process for the Team Captains. It's been reported that Max Calavera of Sepultura/Soulfly fame and Adam D of Killswitch Engage were asked to be Team Captains, but unfortunately declined. Perhaps that explains why the inexperienced Matt Heafy was thrust into a Team Captain role he clearly wasn't ready for. He may be one of Roadrunner's most promising new talents, but he is only 19 years old, and it shows in the tracks he wrote and produced. All too often, they sound like demos recorded in Mom's basement by a kid with dreams of being a rock star. Heafy has a long way to go before he can consider himself a peer of his fellow team captains.     Overall, Roadrunner United gets points for its original concept, and fans of the label and its bands will likely enjoy banging their heads to this cacophonic mob. If this album is intended to be strictly for the hardcore Roadrunner fan, it succeeds. But it certainly isn't going to win over the uninitiated.

Not to get depressed by what we learn, but take some individual actions, to make things better. We don't want to see our species disappears because of some crazy people thrusting after money.    <br />The style is very pleasant; everything is fully explained for people who are not familiar with these subjects. You just  can't stop reading it.
0375758992|4.0|What a gripping story about a girls hard life in a turbulent African country. It makes you feel desparate for the children of this family, who are moved around by parents who do not seem to be able to offer a protective, caring life that every child deserves. I found this story very sad, primarily due to its hardhitting and honest depiction of what Alexandra ( author) must have gone through while her parents lived in tough African countries with little money, exposing their children to people and violence that makes your skin crawl.
0761944524|3.0|I've read the other reviews and I generally agree: This is a well written stats book, especially if you are trying to learn the underlying theories rather than just randomly banging around on a keyboard.     However, don't expect this book to be a particularly good choice if you need to do anything too elaborate.  Even though this book is 770+ pages long, Field doesn't address realistic scenarios. For example, even though he devotes about 210 pages to all sorts of ANOVA, there is no mention of repeated measures ANCOVA, which is not that unusual. Another example is that while he devotes a whole chapter to exploratory factor analysis, he only briefly mentions confirmatory factor analysis, which is the preferred method in most cases.  In some places, he seems to suggest that something is difficult (e.g., contrasts in repeated measures ANOVA) and then offers only weak examples of what to do about it with no mention of how to report what you've done. In fact, he offers very few examples of how to report results, and in some cases, his running examples are nonsignificant so his reporting examples stop short.      All together, this is a good stats theory book with an intro to SPSS, but it's not the kind of book that is going to get you through many real-world analyses. I would recommend this book to undergraduate and graduate students, but folks hoping to survive the peer-review process should probably supplement this book with others.  I think Field would be better off dividing the book into smaller works (e.g., devote one whole text to analysis of variance) and spending more time on each topic, rather than expanding on this edition.
B00063MBU8|4.0|At first I didn't simple plan but then i listened to the album and i liked it. I like most of the tracks. The one track i really don,t like is \\"Thank You\\" it kind of bores me. But other wise it is a great buy.
B000075BFK|4.0|It's 2pac, he's good at reaching people talking about everyday struggles. I think he's aiming at young black males, black woman, and things in that nature, but he touches everybody. 2pac has been copied by so many other rappers it's sicking's me. The best rapper of all time, died so young but had a mind of somebody alot older than he was. Anyway the album has some songs dissing Biggie and some talking about everyday struggles. It's 2pac no matter who does the beats his album is going to be better than average.  <br /> <br />\\"Expect me n**** expect a n**** like you expect Jesus to come back, expect me n**** I'm coming.\\"  <br />               -2pac  <br /> <br />Thos album gets a 4 out of 5
B0000028VT|5.0|Mariah Carey's Music Box album is by far her masterpiece! This album is hot, hot, hot. This is truly Mariah at her best, what a voice. Standout tracks include: Dreamlover, All I Ever Wanted, Without You, Just to Hold you Once Again, and Now That I Know. The rest of the tracks are gorgeous as well. Beautiful arrangements, catchy fun lyrics, and music that speaks to every young girl in America. Too bad Mariah has completely lost the magic now, her voice is lifeless and thin, her image is so contrived and and her personality just screams pampered diva. But believe me Music Box is pure and utter greatness from once a gifted and beautiful woman. Get this album today, it's a true gem!
B000003TAR|5.0|\\"In Utero\\" is painful to listen to.  The noise hurts my ears.  The \\"music\\" if you can call it music, is pure trash, and yet, this album is my favorite Nirvana album.<br /><br />This album is the best album by one of the best bands in the history of Rock and Roll.  I don't know how \\"In Utero\\" can be the worst sounding album and also the best sounding album at the same time, but the truth remains: this album is here to stay.<br /><br />I hate this album, but I listen to every song almost once every week and I have owned this album for years.  I will never throw this album away because this album defines rock music and further proves that Nirvana was the best (albeit worst) rock band in the history of garbage music.<br /><br />Buy the album (c'mon man, it's only about 10 bucks), and learn to love it.
0783229364|4.0|Very enjoyable movie. One of Michael J. Fox's better movies. Yes, the storyline is rather cliche but the characters and appropriate music at the right moments as well as Fox's talents help to make this a very enjoyable movie.

B000AP04FG|1.0|Well, if one could give a zero to rate a movie, I would on this one. This movie ruins what I thought Brad Pitt could be in his career as an actor. After seeing his acting in Kalifornia, which is excellently acted by Pitt, this movie is horrible, and a total waste of time to watch. It's about a married couple who are hitmen, but both don't know that the other is. Then it comes down to them having a \\"hit\\" on their spouse, (which is each other.) The scene of them trying to kill each other with the shootout at their own home is radiculous. It's the most fake acting I have ever seen before, not to mention drawn out to take forever, leaving their house full of holes and in the shambles, but no one dead is so unreal. Angelina Jolie, who played in \\"Beyond Borders\\", was a well made movie, but this movie of her playing Mrs. Smith ruined her acting career also. I guess everyone has at least one movie that is bad, and this certainly hits the top of the charts when it comes to bad. If you're dying to see this because of who is acting in it, just rent it, you'll be glad you didn't waste your money investing in it for your movie collection.
B000FS9FCG|5.0|I have to agree with a lot of what has been said about the film. The film left me wanting to know more about the man.  Being disfigured beneath the mask; I still wanted to see the face of the man.  What type of life did he lead before this?  What was his job? What made him want to act? These are all unanswered questions that make the movie less.  I didn't read the graphic novel.  I intend to if it answers any questions the film didn't.<br /><br />I would have liked to have seen the Wachovski's first pass at the script.  It might have provided more answers than this final version.  It was a great film but I have to wonder if any of the best parts were left on the cutting room floor.....

Watchmen has stood the test of time for a reason (It's GREAT) and if you enjoy comics but haven't read Watchmen yet you are seriously missing out on one of if not the best comic book works ever. The presentation of Watchmen in the Absolute Edition is the perfect format for such a classic piece of work. If you dont want to spend the extra money then get the trade paperback, if you read comics or graphic novels you owe it to yourself to read Watchmen. Buy it, borrow it or read it at the library but read it now!
B0007X6ST2|5.0|The success of Sting's first solo tour inspired him to turn it into a now-classic documentary, as well as an outstanding live album, both titled BRING ON THE NIGHT.  The album finds Sting and his Blue Turtles Band at their most jazzy, melding Sting's then-few solo compositions with jazzed-up remakes of Police tunes.  Though Sting is great, it's the Blue Turtles Band that steals the show, particularly Branford Marsalis, whose saxophone has a voice all of its own.  The songs are delightful, particularly \\"We Work The Black Seam\\", \\"The Dream Of The Blue Turtles/Demolition Man\\", \\"I Burn For You\\", \\"Another Day\\", and the cover of \\"I've Been Down So Long\\".  Some of the live songs are actually superior to their studio originals, namely \\"Moon Over Bourbon Street\\".  BRING ON THE NIGHT is not just an extraodinary live album - it's one of the best ever recorded.
1563898586|5.0|Really enjoyed this book. The storyline is so very original and the use of the well known characters from literature in a comic book format is great. I enjoyed the movie for what it was but if you've only seen the movie you owe it to yourself to read this. There is so much more detail and character development in this book that is impossible to put in a movie, especially when the book is written by Mr. Moore. If you like comics or read graphic novels this is a \\"must read\\"
0670033375|1.0|In his magnum opus, 1984, George Orwell famously wrote,  \\"Who controls the past, controls the future and who controls the present controls the past\\". This is a lesson that Jared Diamond has obviously learned well. <br /> <br />In his latest book \\"Collapse\\" Jared Diamond\\" continues to push the Europhobic liberal agenda. Hiding behind the facade of environmentalism Diamond crafts a sub-text that calls for Europeans to embrace the values of failed third-world cultures and abandon the pursuit of technological advancement that has created global European cultural hegemony. Unfortunately for Diamond, genuine scientific research is revealing much of his work to be based on nothing more than wishful thinking and an overactive imagination. <br /> <br />Diamond makes the assertion that Easter Island experienced a cultural collapse due to depletion of natural resources and overpopulation. This may conflate well with the tenets of liberalism but unfortunately for Mr Diamond, it does not conflate well with the factual findings of the latest archaeological investigations. Radiocarbon dating of soil samples, by Carl Lipo and Terry Hunt, indicate that Easter Island was not inhabited until two to eight hundred years after the occupation time that Diamond's theory would require. Quite simply, the new evidence uncovered by Lipo and Hunt indicates that the period of human habitation of Easter Island was far too short for Diamond's putative collapse to have been the result of overpopulation. To quote Carl Lipo,  <br /> <br />\\"It fits our 21st century view of us as ecological monsters. There's no doubt that we do terrible things ecologically, but we're passing that on to the past, which may not have been actually the case, to stick our plight on to them is unfair\\" <br /> <br />It is difficult to over-emphasise just how badly compromised Diamond is by this evidence. The Easter Island chapter is a major plank in his argument, the fact that Diamond is rank ignorant of the latest archeological research reveals him to be an amateur polemicist rather than a scientific authority figure. <br /> <br />Those who may think that Diamond's Easter Island fantasy is simply an abberation might want to introduce some hard science into their analysis of Diamond's version of the history of Greenland. The extinction of Greenland's Viking colony is used by Diamond to enforce the ideology of modern liberalism. Diamond claims that the Vikings perished because a racist contempt for the Inuit prevented them from assimilating ideas that would have prevented their slow starvation. A cultural superiority complex caused the Viking colonists to cling to an unviable agricultural lifestyle and, in Diamonds words, \\"The Greenland colonists starved to death surrounded by oceans teeming with fish\\". This is an analysis that neatly dovetails with modern pro-immigrant, liberal cultural relativism and the dogma of multiculturalism. The major flaw in Diamond's argument is that the latest historical research shows that by the time of the colony's extinction the Greenland Vikings had, in point of fact, switched from a diet that was 80% farm food to a diet that was 80% marine food.  In otherwords, the Viking colonists proved to be perfectly capable of adapting to environmental change without having to learn lessons from stone age primitives. To present the Vikings as beloning to a soley agrarian culture in the first place would be the cause for much derisive laughter among genuine historians. The Vikings are well known (unless you are Diamond) to have exploited a rich variety of marine life as a food resource.  <br /> <br />The alternative explanation for the Vikings demise is that the mini-ice age that caused the Vikings to switch diets also witnessed a mass immigration of Alaskan Inuit who competed with the Vikings for food and finally massacred them in an unrecorded genocide. We know about the mini ice-age from the evidence of core samples and tree rings. We know about the Innuit peregrinations through archeology and folk record. In the face of genuine science and history I'm afraid Mr Diamond is left up a certain creek without means of conveyance. Historians tend not to write about evolutionary biology, perhaps evolutionary biologists might in future restrain their urge to embarrass themselves by writing about history?  <br />
0375831002|1.0|I can't help but shake my head at some of the previous reviews of what is ultimately an okay-but-not-great book. My family recently finished Pullman's The Golden Compass and Lewis's Narnia. Now these are great books worthy of claims of 10-star ratings. This one? Not really. My kids and I struggled to get through this and it seemed more like work than fun.
B00008DDRX|5.0|Bought the CD after having the video for years.  This is a great movie if you are a racing fan.  Steve McQueen spent a fortune making the racing movie he wanted to produce.  The photograpy is great - -  the storyline secondary.  All filmed at the LeMans track in the 69-70 era when the 8 mile configuration was at its best.  \\"Grand Prix\\" as a movie was very good - - but clearly a second to Le Mans.
B000EQH2QK|4.0|Colombian rock goddess Shakira's hips may not lie, but her second English language record Oral Fixation Vol. 2 doesn't either.  It's a little suggestive since her mouth is probably the last thing one's going to fixate on, but once you start listening it's hard to stop.  Opener \\"How Do You Do\\" is a strong one and brilliantly tackles the oft-controversial topic of questioning one's religious upbringing.  Global smash single \\"Hips Don't Lie\\" featuring Wyclef Jean is pure indulgent fun and is the album's standout track.  \\"Animal City\\" discusses the downfalls of fame and celebrity, as does a handful of other songs.  \\"Dreams For Plans\\" is beautiful and addictive with each listen.  \\"Timor\\" begins with a children's chorus chanting the title in beautiful harmony before it breaks into a swarm of disco-infused dance musings, and it happens to be one of Oral Fixation's best moments.  Ex-No. 1 \\"La Tortuga\\" is presented here in an alternate version and remains as addictive as the original.  Sure, the album isn't perfect, but with each listen it just gets better and better.
B000GFLKF8|5.0|This film is so good that carries a pearl \\"inside\\" it: Miss Florina Petcu. She's so hot, so exhilarating that I'm amazed that since this movie no one hear about her on a more generous role in another movie (I think she'll be a great Wonder Woman). She's the real deal.
B0002W18MU|5.0|This album reminds me of self portraits painters do later in life revealing their age and all their flaws. I like this album because in spite of Johnny's bad health and the sorrow he was dealing with after loosing his wife June he makes it work and his emotion pours out on every song. <br /> <br />My favorite songs on this album are \\"God's gonna knock you down\\" and \\"like the 309\\". These songs reflect Johnny's great song writing skill and the fact that even though his body was breaking down his mind was still going strong.

B00005JP5J|4.0|Road movies are a particular weakness for me, and this out-of-left-field 2006 movie is no exception. It's a charmer written by first-time screenwriter Michael Arndt about a dysfunctional family that you end up liking in spite of how they often act. Co-directed by the husband and wife team of Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris, this uproarious comedy obviously benefits from both perspectives in balancing the satirical elements with the subtleties of the character arcs in the Hoover family as we follow them in their dilapidated Volkswagen van.<br /><br />The plot revolves around seven-year old Olive, who finds out that she is a finalist in the Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant to be held in Redondo Beach, California in two days. Her father Richard is a motivational speaker who wants the world to think he is the next Tony Robbins. Her grandfather has been thrown out of his retirement home for shouting expletives and snorting heroin. Her brother Dwayne reads Nietzsche and has taken a vow of silence until he gets accepted for flight training into the Air Force Academy. Her Uncle Frank, a gay academic expert at Proust, has just been released from a hospital after trying to commit suicide over his lover's abandonment. Her no-nonsense mother Sheryl tries to hold the family together through sheer will but often finds herself lost under the strained circumstances.<br /><br />Eerie visions of JonBenet Ramsey will come back to you when you see the pageant climax itself but not before the actors inject a great deal of humanity into their performances. Reunited after playing a divorcing couple in 2001's \\"Dinner with Friends\\", Greg Kinnear and Toni Collette show their expertise in portraying a marriage in trouble. With a wariness corrupting his usual preppy veneer, Kinnear brings out the nasty edge of a resentful man unable to fulfill his ambitions. Collette continues to impress with her unique combination of sharp intelligence and visceral emotionalism. As Frank, Steve Carell shows a surprising ability for gravitas that his Frat Pack cronies have not yet exhibited. Veteran actor Alan Arkin is a welcome presence as Grandpa, and looking appropriately Goth-like, Paul Dano is hilariously dead-eyed as Dwayne.<br /><br />Abigail Breslin is an unaffected joy as Olive, and she makes the most of the talent competition in the film's most winning moments. There are also memorable bits from Paula Newsome as a curt grief counselor; Beth Grant as a snippy, bouffant-headed pageant official; and Mary Lynn Rajskub (Chloe from \\"24\\") showing her trademark perturbed look as a contest assistant. There are some contrived moments, for example, the chance encounter between Frank and his lover in the convenience store or the free-wheeling freeway exit contortions, when reality is sacrificed for dramatic effect. On the whole, however, this idiosyncratic road movie is well worth the ride share.l shows a surprising ability for gravitas that his Frat Pack cronies have not yet exhibited.

B000AP04FG|2.0|This clanging, crashing 2005 superstar coupling seems to aspire to be a new millennium retake on John Huston's \\"Prizzi's Honor\\" and Danny DeVito's \\"War of the Roses\\", but it turns out to be a gadget-oriented action flick with grand pretensions about how a seemingly ideal couple handle marital discord.  It certainly helps that director Doug Liman (who did a superb job on the underrated \\"Go\\" in 1999) has cast two ludicrously attractive leads whose intertwining personal lives would eventually overshadow their onscreen shenanigans. Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie star in the title roles, John and Jane Smith, and things start promisingly with Simon Kinberg's scattershot screenplay setting them up as typically upscale married suburbanites who both try to manage professional demands in light of a sagging marriage.<br /><br />As it turns out, they are both highly paid assassins who of course, are hired to rub the other out. This revelation is hardly surprising, but I didn't know it would signal a significant decrease in creativity for the rest of the film even as the fireworks get more explosive. The special effects and swift gunplay can be dazzling but are left on overkill mode, but by far, the worst scene is an overextended fight scene between the two that eschews its black comedy elements in favor of a commercial for domestic violence. But even this would be forgivable if Liman and Kinberg could figure out how to end the story. It seems to breathe on high-octane but strangely remains devoid of any real suspense and then abruptly stops with no real denouement.<br /><br />Pacing is a major problem with the movie as it feels like it goes on for far too long. Luckily, the stars have enough charisma to maintain some interest throughout. Both often lend a nice comic spark to their performances, though neither knows how to convey irony without an irritating wink-wink manner. As Eddie, Mr. Smith's cohort, Vince Vaughan seems to be the only one who seems completely adept at black comedy. Kerry Washington, on the other hand, makes virtually no impression as Mrs. Smith's task force colleague. Even though he shows off an impressive set of six-pack abs, Pitt seems particularly lost at times, but Jolie manages to dominate the pairing with her stunning beauty and take-no-prisoners attitude. It's too bad the story serves merely as a vehicle for their mutual posturing.ington, on the other hand, makes virtually no impression as Mrs. Smith's task force colleague.

B00005MP58|5.0|I've seen this version so many times I can't count them.  Very true to the book.  Well done in every way.  I also love the new version, but this gives the full story which the newer movie has to cut due to time restrictions.
B000089QEN|5.0|Lots of different opinions here, lots of love and a some surprising hate. I can only speak for myself and my wife, but we found this DVD riveting. One of the most absorbing BBC productions we've seen. Andrew Davies here seems to be criticized for straying too far from the text, and in other adaptations of not straying far enough. Well, all I can say is that this tale, and this filming, were perfect. Enjoyed the music, which was beautifully composed and appropriately harsh for a very harsh tale, admired the direction, found the characters compelling and believable, and loved the subtle and deft touches throughout in which character was revealed oh so skillfully. An though the acting was impeccable, three actors deserve special accolades. Tim Woodward, a face I had not seen before, is gripping as John Osborne, the conflicted and tormented father who loves and desires and hopes and fears and bullies. Nathaniel Parker, recently seen in Bleak House as a dim-witted and selfish fool, is exquisite, showing us with eyes and mouth the pains, the torments, and the heartbreak of a man who suddenly realizes he has been sucker-punched. The good-hearted, naive, and silly Joseph Sedley, a character it would be all-too-easy to laugh at, is portrayed without malice by a charming Jeremy Swift. Other wonders abound, from the smallest characters up to Becky herself, the toxic blend of a beauty we want to trust and an evil that is all too painfully exposed.<br /><br />We bought in completely. Compared to the Witherspoon version, far more gorgeous and spectacular, but ultimately lame and vapid, this is astounding. A delight from start to finish. If a novel is filmed, and the result is nearly perfect, even if the original plot was abused, I do not care. Think of David Lean's Great Expectations, related to, but freely adapted from, a sprawling masterpiece, and an absolutely riveting piece of cinema. That was a great film from a glorious book. If the film substantially alters the novel's themes, or pretties up the author's vision, well, that is unpardonable. But no such transformation happens here. To compress 800 pages and a multitude of characters even into 6 hours, well concessions must be made. I cannot help but believe that Thackery would be quite pleased with these choices.pretties up the author's vision, well, that is unpardonable. But no such transformation happens here.

B000E97Y6A|5.0|I remember seeing King Kong as a teenager in the 80s and I was quite impressed by the story, but don't remember having any strong feelings for the mighty Kong. Watching this modern version helps you appreciate the work of animal rights activists- this beast has a soul! Naomi Watts does an amazing job I think getting across a believable performance that she actually cares for this giant beast despite having no spoken dialogue with Kong. Jack Black is also well cast as the funny, but ambitious adventurer that you love and hate at the same time.<br /><br />Brilliant depiction of the other beasts on skull island including the super scary locals, some of the most scary scenes in the film without a doubt. I don't think I will allow my kids to watch this one for a while, but I think there are good lessons there for teenagers and older to see and learn from.<br /><br />I think the people of the world could do with a more daunting feeling about nature and animals- we have controlled and killed most beasts on the planet, dangerous or not- it is a shame there aren't giant killer animals to intimidate us and put us in our place, it might make people respect nature and the environment more. I would prefer to be scared of giant beasts over global warming, terrorist attacks and war anyday.
B000FFJYCU|4.0|Visually stunning, terrfic story, and credible acting.  However, this is a film that lends itself, not only to visual effects, but to awesome sound effects.  The film was released in Super Panavision (CINERAMA) with a six track stereo sound track.  Watching this film through my home theater, all the sound came out of the center speaker.  There were no other front effects, rear effects, and nothing from my subwoofer.  This DVD certainly failed to produce any sound effects in supposedly Dolby 5.1.
B000FS9FCQ|4.0|...I actually liked this movie. There are changes. Changes in comic book story from the original material to movies happen way too much in Hollywood for my tastes but they happen. Why movie execs can't trust the decisions made by writers in other mediums is beyond me...<br /><br />Still, V shines through. I liked the beefed-up character of Evey. Natalie did a great job. Her acting was spot-on! Sometimes the visuals were amazing. Sometimes they were too Matrix for my taste. The acting was great and Hugo Weaving was fantastic, doing more acting even though he wore a mask than most actors do when they aren't wearing a mask. Good performances from two Stephens, Frey and Rea. John Hurt was truly frightening as the Chancellor.<br /><br />There were some things I would like to have seen from Graphic Novel. I would like to have seen the train scene in the beginning and I think it would have been better if they had kept in that a computer was basically running the government. Also, I wish they had gone into Finch's transformation at Larkhill a little more. There was more character development in the graphic novel.<br /><br />Things I'd wish they'd not had in the movie: too much of a love story between V and Evey. The end seen with the Fingermen and V was too Matrix and too Crow! And too gory. Blood was on a minimum through the whole movie (and I'm complaining here because I'm squeamish - far from it) and then you get to the fight between the Fingermen and V and there's blood flying out in great splashes. It was uneven with the rest of the movie.<br /><br />Overall, I liked the movie. It was solid, entertaining, and well executed. It didn't make me think as much as Allan Moore's graphic novel did. But then the day that Hollywood realizes that comic books can be great source material for more than just action/adventure movies... well, that will be a revolution!

B00005UQ9F|5.0|I am a graduate psychology student, and viewed the film as a recommendation by Blockbuster online.  I also enjoy horror movies.  The overall plot is great, and I enjoy the different characters portrayed.  Additionally, it is interesting to see how elements of psychology and actual side effects of treatment were combined within the film.  A side effect of art therapy in the 70's was suicidality and delusions.  Additionally, the ending scene is straight out of the effects of lobotomy as well.  After a lobotomy, some individuals exhibit spasms where the arms and legs flail.  This is not only an eerily creepy film with atmosphere of the daunting Danvers State Hospital, but includes accurate psychological reactions that an individual may experience with the types of therapy and procedures discussed.
B00003CX95|1.0|There are so many historical inaccuracies and outright lies in this movie that it boggles the imagination. This is way beyond the usual Hollywood \\"artistic license\\". The battle of Stirling, as depicted in the film is not even close to the truth other than the fact that the Scots won. King Edward I never through his sons male lover out of the tower window........the list just goes on and on. I am consigning my DVD copy to the trash can where it belongs.
6304936362|2.0|I watched this film with great expectation because I found that it was rated with 4 or 5 stars by many reviewers. After one hour of watching I felt very boring and very disappointed. I intended to throw the DVD immediately to the rubbish bin but I hardly finished it to the end. The B-17 bomber in this film was very poorly artificial computer-made. It looks like the aircraft of an computer war game. I think the B-17 is real in the film only when it is rising and landing. Over 99% of the scenes the B-17 is not real. The air battle is not convincing and the scenes are very poorly made also. In one scene, a German fighter collide with a B-17 and the B-17 was broken instantly into two pieces without any fire or smoke. In another scene, the head of a B-17 is severly damaged and an aircrew is throw and ejected like a plastic toy or doll falling down and again with no smoke, burn or fire. All these scenes cannot convince me that it is an air battle. I felt that I was watching a cartoon film. The sound effects are also very poorly made. When you watch a documentary film, the air battle scene scares and horrifies you because the battle is real, it is very intensive and destructive but this film is not. <br /> <br />For those reviewers who gave this film 4 or 5 stars, I suggest them to compare this film with 1969's film BATTLE OF BRITAIN  (I rated this film with 5 stars). The BATTLE OF BRITAIN is very successful because it is very difficult for you to discriminate  <br />between a real aircraft and an artifical one in all scenes. I guess that over 95% of the scenes, the film is using real aircraft for filming since in 1960's there is no computer-made airplanes. The sound and visual effects of BATTLE OF BRITAIN are also excellent. <br /> <br />Just when I prepare to throw this DVD I found that there are some information and statistics in the DVD's Special Features that attract me so I keep it. I understand that it is very difficult to make a good war movie especially air battle. I know from the Special Features's Behind the Scenes that the director and many actors had worked very hard in the production of this film. I very much appreciate their effort spent. But be honest, I don't enjoy this film and I shall not see it again for second time. I think that the film is only or more suitable for children or schoolboy aged below 10 because they won't care whether the aircraft is real or not. For adult, I recommend BATTLE OF BRITAIN  or  THE MEMPHIS BELLE (60th anniversary collector's edition) because it is a real documentary film.
B000FSME1A|5.0|I'm glad to see the original version has been restored in this box set.  I saw the director's cut when it was released in 2001, and while it fills in some interesting gaps, most notably the plantation scene, it doesn't really add anything to the movie.  It is better in its 1979 format.  I well understand Coppola's desire to tinker with his movie.  What director doesn't want to go back and clean up his movies, add deleted footage and repackage it as a director's cut, but we have seen time and time again that this rarely works.  Here you get both versions so that you can decide for yourself.  Either way, Apocalpse Now remains a classic work, quite arguably the best Vietnam War movie ever made.

B000FT933G|5.0|This is one of the best and most creative films ever made. Totally inventive in concept, the story revolves around an exuberant and romantic Italian man named Guido, who also happens to be Jewish. He sweeps the woman of his dreams, his \\"Principessa\\", off her feet. They marry and have an adorable little boy whom they dearly love. Unfortunately, this all happens during World War II in fascist Italy.<br /><br />Ultimately, Guido and their son are whisked away to a concentration/work camp on their young son's birthday. Meanwhile, his wife and the boy's mother, coming home and expecting to find a birthday celebration in progress, discovers, instead, that the inevitable has occurred. She tracks them down to the train that is taking prisoners to a work camp and, after confirming that they are on board, insists upon boarding the train herself, so that she may remain close to them. They see her board the train and know that she is with them.<br /><br />In order to get his son through this horror as best he can, Guido tells his son that they are involved in a real life game to win a tank, knowing that the boy had wanted a toy tank for his birthday. Talk about a reality survival game! In any case, his son is young enough to fall for it and gets with the program as only the very young can. What follows is a series of inventive scenarios which tells the viewer of the lengths that the father goes in order to keep his son quiet, obedient, entertained, and safe from harm. All along, the father has his son believing in the game and playing to win, to the point that the boy believes that they are actually in first place to win the tank.<br /><br />While this may sound like an odd venue in which to find oneself laughing, that is exactly what the viewer does. At the same time, the film is achingly poignant, and the end is infinitely sad. Guido is played to perfection by comedic star and filmmaker Roberto Benigni, who also directed this masterpiece. His on screen wife and comedic foil is played by his real life main squeeze, Nicoletta Braschi. The son is played with wondrous innocence by the totally adorable Giorgio Cantarini. This is an award caliber film that saw Benigni deservedly capture Oscars for Best Actor and Best Foreign Language Film.<br /><br />All in all, this film will leave the viewer both laughing and crying. It is simply a great movie. Bravo!s played by his real life main squeeze, Nicoletta Braschi. The son is played with wondrous innocence by the totally adorable Giorgio Cantarini.

B000E33VWW|4.0|Philip Seymour Hoffman has played a series of sarcastic buffoons and petty low-lifes (see his turns in \\"The Talented Mr. Ripley,\\" \\"Boogie Nights,\\" and \\"Scent of a Woman\\") and has always been one of those actors whom you really want to see \\"in the margins\\" of a movie.  He was almost always surprisingly good in surprisingly enjoyable films, and his name appearing a few names below the stars' in the cast was almost a validation that the movie was worth your time. <br /> <br />But with \\"Capote,\\" Hoffman cast aside whatever \\"marginal\\" status he may have had and has given one of the best on-screen performances in recent years.  The gifted writer, Truman Capote, was such a caricature of himself that he almost defies an actor's chance to \\"play it straight,\\" but somehow Hoffman manages to do so.  This is a performance for the ages - Hoffman has done something on a par with what Charlize Theron did with her masterful turn as the pathetic serial killer in \\"Monster.\\"   <br /> <br />\\"Capote\\" focuses on the six-year period where Truman Capote researched and wrote \\"In Cold Blood,\\" about the 1959 murder of the Clutter family in Holcolm, Kansas, and the ultimate execution of the two murderers, Dick Hickock and Perry Smith.  Capote was a semi-famous writer, with \\"Breakfast at Tiffany's\\" under his belt, but Capote knew that he had not yet lived up to his own self-image (revealed in a wonderful scene where Nell Harper Lee, Capote's research assistant and future author of \\"To Kill a Mockingbird,\\" deduces that the compliments being paid to Capote by a fan are the result of a Capote pay-off).   <br /> <br />\\"Capote\\" keeps its focus on Truman, which is probably appropriate for an ego-maniac like him, but it comes at a cost to the story.  The only quibble I have is that virtually every supporting character in \\"Capote\\" is entirely static . . . some very talented actors are not given a second note to play, but are solid in their one-note roles. <br /> <br />But in the movie's praise, it getsvirtually everything else right.  Truman was the epitome of the self-centered writer, blissfully content to sip cocktails and be the center of attention in New York and to accept adulation, using his outlandish fashion sense to set himself apart (and, he thinks, above) the plain people of Kansas, and furious with anyone who interferes with his grasp of the spotlight -- as both Lee and Perry Smith learn to their chagrin.   <br /> <br />The movie also captures the torment writing \\"In Cold Blood\\" put Capote through, a uniquely Capote-esque kind of torture.  When Smith and Hickock are sentenced to death, Capote knows that he has an ending to his book. But the two murderers keep getting stays of execution, and Capote starts to whine that \\"they are torturing me\\" because he can't finish his book.  Virtually everyone around him sees this corruption of Capote's soul, but this master of insight can't see it in himself.  He only feels the pain, but cannot recognize its cause. <br /> <br />A wonderful performance in a very good movie, Hoffman has likely done for Capote what George C. Scott did for General Patton - formed the defining image of a noteworthy character starting to get lost in the mists of time.  Check it out.
0452270073|5.0|What a deft, daring and brilliant trilogy this is, an extraordinary product of extensive historical research, deep psychological insight  and the vivid imagination of a gifted writer. Barker ventures into territory --military and sexual -- where few women writers have gone and transforms it for the reader. This is great literature.
1572814349|5.0|This deck is gorgeous and truly gives you the feel of the \\"Old World\\" when you're working with it. Spend some quiet time and study each card's intricate and detailed artwork. The artist gives her sources for each card, and it's informative to go through each one and read the source at the same time. I've already had many successful readings with the Golden Tarot deck. Highly recommended! )O(
B0006L16N8|2.0|<br />Bands don't need to be different for the sake of being different, but I prefer when each CD a band creates is a separate entity from the ones that have come before them. X&Y is basically a clone of RUSH OF BLOOD TO THE HEAD but lacking the few essential differences that would make this something other than a tired retread. The same sound, the ethereal production, but now it's wearing thin because you sit there and say \\"Haven't we heard this before?\\" I don't really dislike the sound, but X&Y is just pleasant background noise. Here's hoping the next time out the band puts a little edge on their music. <br />
B00000DCHI|4.0|This is a good Billy Joel hits collection although there are a few songs not on this album, namely a couple of songs from  <br />'An Innocent man\\" (including the title song- this would later be featured on greatest hits volume 3 along with \\"Keeping the Faith\\") and \\"Honesty\\" from \\"52nd Street\\" (although I have a copy of this album on cassette at home which I bought in about 1988 which includes this song- I'm from down under) <br /> <br />The two additional songs \\"You're only human (second wind) and <br />\\"The night is still young\\" are fabulous songs too. <br /> <br />A good representation of Billy Joel's career from 1974-1985
B00005JP5J|5.0|What a great, great movie \\"Little Miss Sunshine\\" is; it tells a simple yet genuinely effective human story, and it includes characters that are very realistically portrayed. That's a treat from the audience's point of view; no matter how quirky or unconventional the circumstances of the film may be, normal characters have the remarkable ability to connect with viewers. The characters in this film make up the classic dysfunctional family, each member going through their own inner turmoil. They often fight, they regularly swear, and they each have personalities that clash to an incredible degree. How much more real can it get, especially when elements like financial trouble and emotional suffering are thrown into the mix? No one in this film is a rigid caricature, and that made it worthwhile.    It's also a very funny film. But I'm using the word \\"funny\\" in a very different context, almost (but not quite) with an air of sarcasm. For the most part, it's not funny in a laugh-out-loud kind of way; rather, it's funny in an I-know-exactly-how-that-character-feels kind of way, presenting situations that the audience is able to understand and sympathize with. It was an interesting storytelling method, especially since every main character in this film is forced to partake in something they would rather do without. Olive (Abigail Breslin) is a seven-year-old girl who dreams of someday winning a beauty pageant. To say her family life in New Mexico is chaotic would be an understatement; she shares a home with family members that, at first glance, don't seem compatible in any way.     The father, Richard (Greg Kinnear), is a completely misguided motivational speaker-wannabe. The mother, Sheryl (Toni Collette), is a typical caring mom who understands how bad the family's financial situation is. Of course, Richard is certain that his new program--a self-help system that is supposedly completed in just nine steps--will be hailed as the next big thing in striving for excellence. Thebrother, Dwayne (Paul Dano), is an incredibly unhappy teenager who wants to be in the Air Force and has recently taken a vow of silence (he's also taken to reading the works of Frederick Nitzsche). The uncle, Frank (Steve Carell), has recently attempted suicide due to a failed gay relationship, the loss of his job, and the loss of a prestigious teaching award. Finally, there's the grandfather (Alan Arkin), a cantankerous old man who seems to have many regrets in life, most of which involve not having lived fast or died young. For these reasons, he's now snorts heroine on a regular basis.    Apparently, Olive had competed in an Albuquerque child beauty pageant and came in second. But some weeks later, Cheryl's sister calls and tells the family the good news: the first place winner of that contest has been disqualified (\\"Something to do with diet pills!\\"). By default, Olive is now eligible to compete in the national Little Miss Sunshine pageant. As you can probably imagine, this sends Olive into a whirlwind of excitement. But because Cheryl's sister is unable to take Olive, this sends the rest of the family into a whirlwind of doubt, uncertainty, and panic. The pageant is being held in Redondo Beach, California; not only can they not afford to fly there, Richard is also trying to contact marketing exec Stan Grossman (Bryan Cranston) in the hopes of turning the nine-step program into a sellable product. What's worse is that Frank can't be left alone for fear of another suicide attempt. The only viable solution is for the entire family to drive to California.    Thus begins the family's journey across the Southwestern United States, one that will test them in almost every conceivable way. One of the biggest obstacles is their Volkswagen bus; the clutch is completely shot, and since they don't have the time or the money to repair it, they have to physically push the car until it reaches third gear (they also can't rely on the brakes). But more compelling are the emotional obstacles each character will have to clear in their own way. The scenes in the van were probably the most significant in terms of allowing the characters to face their problems. Bickering ensues almost immediately, especially between Grandpa, Richard, and Frank. But it's Richard's dialogue that is the most priceless: he just can't get out of his you-should-only-be-a-winner mode, constantly spewing his self-help banter about how methods like sarcasm and quitting are only used by losers. In fact, he thinks they represent one of the lowest of the nine steps. The only kinds of people who do deserve respect are those who actually have goals and are trying to follow them through.     He praises Olive for this mindset; she wants to be involved in a beauty pageant, and because of consistent practicing and the firm belief that she can win, he's willing to support her. Of course, this makes Olive very concerned. From her point of view, her father hates losers, and if she doesn't win, she fears he'll stop loving her. Ready to reassure her is her grandfather; as crotchety as he is, he's also a caring individual, standing by his granddaughter's side no matter what (there's also a very touching scene in the van when he praises Richard for going after what he believed in). He even goes as far as to teach her some moves (none of which we actually see until the end of the movie; boy, is the audience in for a surprise).    But this kind of character complexity isn't limited to just the grandfather; at one point or another, all the family members display different personality traits, ones that make them impossible to label. Again, I go back to the realism of the story: no one in this film is a flat, undeveloped stereotype, just as no one is completely good or bad. They're just ordinary, everyday, flawed people, and they do everything they can to get Olive to California in time. One gets the sense that no matter how much this family goes through, no matter how many arguments they have, they'll always be together, for better or worse. That's the kind of family we'd all like to have, especially when everyone can learn something valuable.    By the time they reach California, they've gone through enough to last them a lifetime, from emotional breakdowns to malfunctioning van equipment to an escapade with a dead body (whose dead body I dare not say). And yet they're ready to let Olive do what she's always dreamed of doing. This is despite the fact that the world of children's beauty pageants hits them like a ton of bricks. Backstage, we see just how far these little girls go to look beautiful: they don hairpieces and false teeth; they're airbrushed with makeup and sunless tanners; they're dressed in sparkly, provocative dresses. When the contestants are on stage, Olive is the only one that actually looks like a real child (which basically means that she's not beauty pageant material).    The final scenes of \\"Little Miss Sunshine\\" are almost too perfect for words. I won't describe them for want of you going out there and seeing this movie for yourself. I will say that it all comes together in a way that's beautiful, funny, and touching all at the same time. How appropriate for a film about the trials and tribulations of family life. There's quite a bit one can learn from a movie like this, and I'm glad I had the opportunity to experience it. One thing I learned was that this was more than story about a beauty pageant. It's actually much simpler than that; it's a story about life and discovering who you are in this world (and I don't mean that in a hokey way). What a perfect message; there aren't enough of them in movies these days.
B00000DCHD|5.0|I read in a book once that Joel Would find it difficult to come up with a follow up to the breakthrough album \\"The stranger-\\" and what to call it \\"The Stranger 2\\" or maybe \\"Son of the Stranger-\\" nah that would be boring.... <br />Instead Billy gave us analbum totally different in concept to that of its predecessor but with the same energy and purpose. <br />As with \\"The Stranger\\" this album sounds like Billy Joel is really enjoying himself, unlike his first couple of albums. <br /> <br />52nd Street is an even more mature sound than the sound captured on Stranger and demonstrates not just Joel's superb musicianship but his influence all musical genres including Jazz, broadway and The Beatles. <br /> <br />The album kicks off with a bang on \\"Big Shot,\\" probably the rockiest of Billy's numbers, then progresses through arguably the best Mcartney tribute on the beautiful \\"Honesty\\" and on to one of the most well known Joel songs in \\"My Life\\" <br /> <br />From then on, the album takes on a real Jazz feel with plenty of brass and latin percussion, including a guest appearance by jazz legend Freddie Hubbard on \\"Zanzibar\\" <br /> <br />The album's closer and title song is probably the only weak point of the album, sounding like a bit of a filler , although as with \\"keeping the Faith\\" on his 1983 album \\"An Innocent man\\" it's probably provides an explanation of what Joel's intention on this album was - \\"To have a party with the album, create music with more of a Jazz feel and once again to demonstrate his musical abilities and to proove to the critics that he is not a wandering piano balladeer. <br /> <br />This is the best Billy Joel album by far and if any Billy Joel fan hasn't got this in their collection (I would doubt they wouldn't\\" then they should NOW!!!!

B000BBOUU4|2.0|Having read the book and loved it, I couldn't wait to see this film. Unfortunately, I was sadly dissapointed when I finally did. <br />The little boy who played Charlie did a fantastic job, and so did the other children who played the parts of the bratty kids. Unfortunately, I couldn't say as much for the adults. When the kids got into their various predicaments in the factory, their parents just stood passively by while the Oompa-Loompas sang their little ditties. In real life, and even in the book, the parents would be screaming at Mr. Wonka to do something to rescue their kids. <br />I also think the director picked the wrong actor for the role of Mr. Wonka. While Johnny Depp did a wonderful job in movies like Pirates of the Carribean and Finding Neverland, he was a poor choice for the part of Willy Wonka. In the book, Willy Wonka is a lively, energetic, almost hyperactive individual who really does like kids - almost a pied piper sort of figure. Depp's Wonka is an anemic-looking, toned-down, rather bland individual who relies on cue cards to say his greetings, doesn't like kids, and can't bring himself to say the word \\"parents.\\" I also didn't like the little add-on at the end, when Mr. Wonka, instead of instantly agreeing to take the whole family to live at the factory, tries to make Charlie leave them behind and Charlie refuses. While this scene was obviously meant to illustrate Charlie's noble character, it didn't work in this movie. Not only did it make a long movie even longer, it was very out of character for Dahl's Wonka, who was really a rather generous, kindhearted person. <br />The Oompa-Loompa scenes were annoying too. The director's efforts to jazz up the Oompa-Loompa segments went overboard -- at times, the accompanying music and scenes distracted heavily from the words being sung, so unless you had read the book and were familiar with the various ditties, it was hard to know exactly what the Oompa-Loompas were singing about. <br />For a wonderful, uplifting Charlie and the Chocolate Factory experience, read the book. This movie is hardly more than a creepy, and pathetic, imitation of the original story.
1594200823|5.0|This was by far one of the best books I have ever read.  Pollan gives the reader an opportunity to finally \\"see\\" exactly what we consume every day by taking us on an educational, humorous and enlightening journey of 4 meals.  Pollan's unbiased description of each meal's source, from the cornfield, feedlot, family farm and forest allows the reader to decide for themself.  This book is an eye-opener without offering judgement.  This is a must read for everyone!
B00006AVRK|5.0|For those who have just discovered Hugh Laurie as the nasty doc in \\"House\\" and for those who have always loved his comic gems, this is a wonderful series.  Laurie and Stephen Fry were a great comedy team...their timing is priceless.  And the P.G. Wodehouse stories are masterpieces of construction with amazing characters like Gussie Fink-Nottle and Roderick Spode.  A real treat.  I was laughing so hard after watching the first two seasons on dvd that I had to take a break in between.  A real classic set. <br /> <br /> <br />

0553565915|2.0|Embraced By The Light by Betty J. Eadie is actually a pretty good book, well written, and probably well-researched from other people's NDE's.  This book is filled with some great stuff, but also some not so great stuff.  Eventually, no matter how open your mind is, it becomes clearer and clearer that some of these things are either made up or a rip-off from other NDE accounts.<br /><br />The author seems sincere and it is a heartfelt account.  I could actually feel myself in her shoes in each page of the book, and empathize with her.  The book is heart-wrenching at times and I actually sobbed.  Not so much in sorrow, but a sadness mixed with joy.  The book is very bittersweet but filled with hope, and it provides an invaluable message...  That the most important thing in life is to enjoy life and to love each other.  Now what I just wrote would make the book worth 5 stars.<br /><br />However, this is where the scale tips backwards.  The book is biased.  She goes on to say that while she was in \\"heaven\\" in her NDE, she realized that the creator of the Universe and all else is Jesus Christ himself.  Of course the description of Jesus is the typical white man with a beard with a light glowing from within his beard.  That's all fine and good.  BUT, Mrs. Eadie forgets to say that the creator of the Universe presented itself to HER as Jesus Christ.  This is not a Universal Truth, it is the author's truth.<br /><br />Eadie makes a good point that while in \\"heaven,\\" she learned that it is foolish to criticize other people's religious beliefs, or lack of...  Then she ruins this promising statement by indicating that Christianity is at the top rung and that all other religions don't hold the same love and promises as the gospel.  To a Christian or Mormon, this would make sense, but the TRUTH is that all religions or lack of them are EQUAL.  Christianity is no better than Buddhism, Hinduism, Judaism, Wicca, Paganism, Tao, or any others.  To think that one is better, more true, or superior to another (even if the bible says so), is just plain ignorance.<br /><br />The bias on the importance of men is another downfall for the book, going back to women being weaker in nature than men and that it was \\"Eve's impatience\\" or whatever in the \\"garden of eden\\" (a biblical fable no more true than the myth of Pandora's Box) that brought death into the world.<br /><br />Men and women are EQUAL, period.  This book also slams the concept of reincarnation.  Reincarnation can't quite be scientifically proven, but it is on the brink.  Shame on you Mrs. Eadie.  But if that's her perspective and what she thought she learned in \\"heaven,\\" than she is entitled to her \\"conclusion.\\"<br /><br />Remember folks...  There can be as many similarities in many individual's Near-Death Experiences as there are differences.  Something that is important to know is that Jesus or Jehovah or Angels are not any more true, real, living, or righteous than Pan, Dionysus, Horus, Osiris, Isis, Demeter, Diana, Hecate, Buddha, Shiva, Krishna, etc, for representations of the Creator.  People need to decide for themselves which form of God or Goddess (YES, GOD COULD BE FEMALE, it's not impossible, no matter what the bible, the kuran, or the book or mormon says) to believe in and/or worship.<br /><br />Overall, this is a decent book, despite its faults and biases.  To a Christian, Mormon, and/or a New Ager, who is dealing with death and dying, or has someone close to you who is, I highly recommend this book to you.  Even to non-Christians, this isn't an entirely bad read, but there are much better accounts for non-Christians and all are just as valid as Mrs. Eadie's.<br /><br />Remember, the most important thing in life is to enjoy it and to love one another.e true, or superior to another (even if the bible says so), is just plain ignorance. <br /> <br />The bias on the importance of men is another downfall for the book, going back to women being weaker in nature than men and that it was \\"Eve's impatience\\" or whatever in the \\"garden of eden\\" (a biblical fable no more true than the myth of Pandora's Box) that brought death into the world.   <br />Men and women are EQUAL, period.

B0009MDPYW|5.0|Constantine is an excellent and very refreshing movie; the plot is strong and good, the acting is fine, and the atmosphere and special effect done very skillfully. In the flood of recent movie production this title stands out - it doesn't need to catch your attention with streams of blood and gore as it became nearly mandatory and so common these days.  <br /> <br />John Constantine is a full-time exorcist who takes on evil forces with great experience and talent. He was born with skills to be able to see the dark forces; in the childhood he regrettably attempted a suicide - a mortal sin that prevents him to enter heaven when he dies - so he dedicates his life to fight the dark forces, and also hopes that his achievements may help him to reopen his way to heaven. Anyway, during what seems to be a routine \\"service call\\" to treat a possessed girl, he encounters one of the unusual and more dangerous demons that are not supposed to be normally entering our world - and John Constantine senses that something bigger is up... his judgment proves right, and John has full hands to deal with the upcoming and quickly worsening situation... The strong part of this movie is the way how supernatural matters are presented here - sort of everyday' bread, casual stuff, and with certain dark humor underlying it - the exorcist takes himself half seriously, he's a chain smoking guy, he does his job but he's not the real \\"hero\\", he's more of a guy to do the job when needed and as he sees it fit.  The instruments of his trade and tricks he uses in his profession are \\"casual\\" as well and include a cat & bucket of water or an electric chair as travel devices to hell, his weaponry includes custom cast bullets, flamethrower built from crucifix, holy water sprayed directly or dispersed through the fire sprinkler system... I watched this movie twice few months apart and enjoyed it both times while being able to catch more story details during the second viewing.  <br /> <br />I'm not familiar with the comic book Hellblazer, the movie is all I'm reviewing here. Constantine appears to be rated very poorly by many reviewers around here - I think the movie is well underrated, and I'm giving it full 5 stars that it in my opinion deserves. <br />
B000AMWIVM|1.0|(Spoilers) <br /> <br />Oh man, remember that movie Se7en? That was a classic. So good it just cries out for a remake. Only, instead of Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman, let's see if we can't get Cary Elwes and Danny Glover, both of whom are available for a slice of pie. Also, let's take the taut, inexorable logic of the original and turn it on its head... sorry, DROP it on its head, removing all wit and sense. Throw in a puppet and a dirty bathroom and BAM! You got yourself a half-a**'d movie, my friend! <br /> <br />SAW actually starts out promising enough. The director throws you into things in media res with Elwes and Some Dude awakening to their surprise in the aforementioned toilette, chained to some pipes that are probably non-functional, but sufficiently atmospheric in a Godsmack video kind of way. Naturally, questions abound. How did they get here? What diabolical madman would do such a thing? How come there's no toilet paper? You get the idea. <br /> <br />Come to find out, Elwes is an oncologist, and these two clowns are at the mercy of one of his cancer patients. That's right, a guy with Stage IV colorectal cancer arranges to capture, kidnap, and torture able-bodied guys half his age. As someone with Stage III colorectal cancer myself, I gotta say, my man gets around! <br /> <br />Would you like a run-down of SAW's 700 other plot holes? Or a sneak peek of its preposterous 'surprise' ending? I didn't think so. Suffice it to say that you get a couple of Se7en's elaborate death traps, but you don't get the moral irony behind them. You don't even get a lot of scare or even gore for your dough. Your biggest fear is that the film will never end! <br /> <br />Props to the puppet, though.
B00005O5CM|4.0|I've been reviewing items for Amazon for a little over a year and a half, now. One of the things that I still don't quite understand is how Amazon picks its \\"Spotlight Reviews.\\" <br /> <br />Sometimes those Reviews are great. But, sometimes... <br /> <br />Okay. Here are excerpts from the current Spotlight Reviews for this film (though they may be different by the time you read this): <br /> <br />\\"I was disappointed by this film. I was hoping it was going to be a satire, a la 'Clueless'. When I realized in the first 15 minutes or so that it was not, then I at least hoped it would be funny in any kind of way (e.g. dumb funny). Well, it didn't even do that.[...]\\" -- First Spotlight Review <br /> <br />\\"As a blonde myself, I really should have been offended by this feature-length blonde joke, but hey, this flick is first-rate fluff.[...]The script is surprisingly smart for fluff and is a huge reason for the success of this extended blonde joke. For mindless entertainment, you can't beat this film. 'Legally Blonde' is one of those guilty pleasures you might hate to admit having. Remember, you can always watch it in the privacy of your own home[...].\\" -- Second Spotlight Review (from a \\"Top 100 Reviewer\\" no less) <br /> <br />Uh... <br /> <br />Maybe it's me. <br /> <br />But I don't think that either of these two reviewers get this film. Legally Blonde is not a movie trying to make fun of blondes. What would even be the point of that? Nor is it a \\"dumb comedy,\\" nor is it trying to be. It is not an extended blonde joke. It is not mindless. Nor is, as the second above reviewer mentioned in her write-up, the main character (Elle) mindless. <br /> <br />In fact, the point of the film is that she has a mind. The point is that, despite being blonde and pretty, she still has other skills and abilities (and an incredible amount of compassion and kindness) that people unfairly overlook or dismiss. This is a movie with a heart, a mind, and, my friends, a message. The message isn't devastatingly clever or anything like that, but it's a good, solid one, nonetheless. And, it appears to have been too subtle for the reviewers quoted above. <br /> <br />Usually, this kind of movie is about a nerd or other outcast who falls in love with a beauty and gets unfairly discriminated against by the popular kids on account of his appearance, etc. This is the exact same film, except the roles are reversed. In this movie, the beautiful, pampered prima-donna is trying her darndest to fit in with the smart kids (the nerds) but is constantly rejected on the basis of the same sorts of shallow, prejudicial judgements from which they typically suffer. When she competes for an internship, everyone assumes that she won't have the brains to pull it off. When she gets that internship based on her skills, people assume that she must have slept her way to the top. Along the way, she is constantly humiliated and made fun of, on a large part based on the color of her hair and the way she dresses. We're not supposed to be laughing at her, people; we're supposed to be sympathizing with her (unless, like the cruel \\"nerds\\" she encounters, we're too tied up in people's looks). <br /> <br />Whether or not you're particularly receptive to it, this movie is trying to say that we all suffer from rejection, ostracization and prejudice--even the pretty and popular. <br /> <br />Even though the Spotlight Reviews here on Amazon might not reflect the fact, this is not a \\"mindless extended blonde-joke,\\" nor is it a failed Clueless; this is a story about an outsider fighting for love and struggling to fit in, and yes, she happens to be blonde and pretty and wear lots of pink. To understand it, I guess, requires at least as much heart as the film was made with.
B000EULJLU|5.0|If I were to have reviewed this album 3 months ago upon it's release, I most certainly would have given it a lower rating.  So it goes without saying that initially I was very disappointed with 10,000 days.  I have been a Tool fan for many years and through those years, I have listened and seen this complex and talented group of musicians produce intense and inspiring art that has become more profoundly elaborate with each new album.  Which is why at first, I could not understand how lyrically, 10,000 days could be so simplistic in presentation.  But now that I understand the album, it's intentions and it's beauty, I can truely say that it is Tool's most poignant and personal album it has ever produced.  <br /> <br />10,000 days, track and album, refers to roughly how long frontman Maynard James Keenan's mother, Judith Marie was paralyzed before she finally died in 2003.  In essense, the album is in sorts a tribute to his mother and understanding it makes many of the tracks very clear lyrically.  Also becoming even more clear is understanding why Maynard would make those lyrics simple because it comes from a place so personal, honest, and uncomplicated.  The album also shows growth, in that his attitude is very different than that from his A Perfect Circle track \\"Judith\\" in which he basically blames her God and her faith for her tragedy.  With the tracks \\"Wings of Marie\\" and \\"10,000 days\\" he expresses redemption for her suffering and optimism for her fate. <br /> <br />Musically, the sound is very similiar to Lateralus with the exception that Justin definately has more of a presence.  Danny Carey is still one of the best drummers if not the best in all of music, regardless of genre, and Adam still brings his unique sound.  What first was contempt towards Maynard for his lyrics in my original viewpoint, turned out to be the most attractive aspect to me now.  So to those complaining about how simple the album is lyrically, it is.  But understanding it will show you that it couldn't have been any other way.

Perhaps this is an arachaic notion, but the exploitation of another's pain, confession, and art for one's own economic gain is simply unethical--no matter what kind of altruistic spin you put on the endeavor.  <br /> <br />By the way, I just love the legal notice that appears at the bottom of the postsecret website: <br /> <br />     By submitting information to PostSecret, you grant          <br />     PostSecret a perpetual, royalty-free license to use,    <br />     reproduce, modify, publish, distribute, and otherwise  <br />     exercise all copyright and publicity rights with respect to      <br />     that information at its sole discretion, including storing    <br />     it on PostSecret servers and incorporating it in other works <br />     in any media now known or later developed including without  <br />     limitation published books. <br /> <br />Smells a bit sulfurous to me.
B000FS9FCG|5.0|Current special effects and our ability to think permits us virtually unlimited possibilities for movies.  In spite of the possibilities, rarely do film makers take full advantage of what is available to them.  Director James McTeigue and writers Alan Moore (who created \\"V for Vendetta\\" as a comic), Andy Wachowski, and Larry Wachowski have taken a concept never before seen in the movies and created a marvelous, enjoyable and entertaining film.<br /><br />Chancellor Adam Sutler (John Hurt) has used a series of wars to create a fascist government in England.  There is an inside joke in this choice of actors.  John Hurt previously played Winston Smith in the movie \\"1984,\\" and he essentially is Big Brother in this movie.  The movie provides us with the history of Guy Fawkes at the very beginning of the movie.  Guy Fawkes failed in an attempt to blow up Parliament on November 5, 1605.  The character V uses a mask of Guy Fawkes to cover his face from the very beginning of the movie.  It takes little imagination to realize that V has some fireworks of his own planned.  Later we learn that V is mostly likely horribly disfigured and the mask may be to save us from seeing V as he really is.<br /><br />Much of what we learn about V comes from his interaction with Evey Hammond (Natalie Portman), who V rescued from a couple of policemen that were about to rape Evey.  Unfortunately, Evey's life takes a nasty turn when she helps V.  Evey's only choice is to stay with V.<br /><br />Other than the introduction and the distraction provided by Evey, who we need so that the story of V can unfold, the remainder of the movie focuses on V and his escapades.  What wonderful escapades they are, and how bizarrely the conflict between V and Sutler proceeds.  We see little of Sutler except as an image on monitors until the very end of the movie.  The monitor is Sutler's mask.  We never see V's face, and V never directly confronts Sutler until the end of the movie.  Even at the end, the confrontation is indirect.  I dare not say more without spoiling the plot further.<br /><br />The result of the interesting progression of this movie is that of a chess game where we see the result of the moves, but the players are rarely, if ever, present.<br /><br />The selection of John Hurt as Sutler and Hugo Weaving as V was brilliant.  Hurt is absolutely sinister and nearly insane as he feels control slipping away.  Hurt executes his role with perfection, and there are places where I thought he was on the edge of frothing at the mouth.<br /><br />Weaving is casual, with a sonorous voice that borders on sinister, and yet can be incredibly romantic.  Weaving brings sadness to his role that is sensed at first in his voice.  V will do what he has to do, but it does not bring him pleasure.  He is logical in his actions and purposeful, without emotion.  V's actions were set in motion by events that happened to him, and we accept those actions as V has accepted them.  V acts like the steps he is taking are equivalent to taking out the garbage or raking the yard.  He must do what he is doing, regardless of the consequences.  His actions are the only purpose he has in his life.<br /><br />One aspect of this film has generated controversy.  Is it acceptable for someone to violently overthrow a government?  We would say no.  However, in this movie the government is no longer democratic.  Sutler is an absolute dictator.  There is no possibility for the government to be representative.  While terrorism, which is what V does, is abhorrent, a fascist government that will not permit a change in government is also abhorrent.  If there was another way to resolve the problems facing England in this movie, I am unable to see what that way was.<br /><br />If this movie makes people wonder, as it made me wonder, or if it makes people think, as it made me think, then the movie has done a wonderful thing.  This movie is creative, thought-provoking, well-plotted, and entertaining.  While this movie may have flaws, I was so caught up in the story and spent so much time trying to think about the story that I failed to spot any.<br /><br />If you enjoy thought-provoking science fiction, try this movie.  I thought it was wonderful, and look forward to watching it again.  Enjoy!ning.  While this movie may have flaws, I was so caught up in the story and spent so much time trying to think about the story that I failed to spot any. <br /> <br />If you enjoy thought-provoking science fiction, try this movie.

1577314808|5.0|This book changed my life.  I connected to it and it affected me like no other book has.  It opened up parts of my mind and spirit in a way that has brought a new perspective on life.  I know these are strong statements and I don't say them lightly.  I have recommended this book to others, some have the same reaction I have and others agree with some of the opposite reviews that got absolutely nothing from the book.  That's O.K.  It is a very personal and individual reaction people will have to this specific material.  It is certainly worth giving this book a read.  The worst that will happen is that you simply won't be one of the people who this book makes a connection with and you'll wonder what all the great reviews are about.  But if you are one of the people this book makes a connection to it's very real, very powerful, and you will be so glad you picked it up.
B000089RVX|4.0|Although the \\"Daredevil\\" soundtrack obviously bouyed this band's success, it's easy to assume that this alternative (honestly that's the best way I can put it simply) outfit from Little Rock, Arkansas, we're overnight sensations. Coming out of nowhere near the tail end of 2002 with their first single \\"Bring Me to Life\\" (which was briefly played during the \\"Daredevil\\" trailer), it certainly got your head turning. Although for the first few seconds the consistient riff-heavy guitars seems to scream out another \\"I wanna be Mettalica!\\" nu-metal outfit, as soon as Amy Lee's vocals smother the track it's unforgettable. Crooning a darkly ethereal, unabashadly soulful sound to the otherwise perpetually heavy, guitar-driven background music, this amalgam of Sarah McLachlan and Linkin Park formed a remarkably inspired, unorthodox rock-and-not-so-much-roll identity. <br /> <br />\\"Bring Me to Life\\" soon became ubiqitous on rock radio and MTV2, <br />clearly illiciting meomories of past hits that one would never expect to be mentioned in the same breath. All of a sudden, Amy Lee was the new queen of contemporary rock, an extremely frail, vaguely gothic Tori Amos/Sarah McLachlan-like figure with a rougher, more tormented edge.  <br /> <br />Although eventully the single got burned out, their cd \\"Fallen\\" also included \\"My Immortal\\", a divine, fawning showcase for Amy Lee's haunting and lovely pipes, as well as the minor hits \\"Going Under\\" and \\"Everybody's Fool\\" (Amy Lee also dueted with Seether for their 2004 single \\"Broken\\"). With relentless touring and numerous other public appearences (including stints on MTV), it was only a matter of time before they got a little overexposed, and took a prolonged break (their follow-up CD is due early this fall).  <br /> <br />Down to the tracks, although the CD is none too surprisngly over-the-top at points, and perhaps trying to cram too many harmonies, verses and somber solos in it's around-an-hour running time, it's definitely a rich, often haunting yet lively standout. The well-buzzed ambiguities of the music's possible pieties (their albums and merchandise was originally being sold at various Christian shops before they gave a \\"WTF\\"-like response in a 2003 Entertainment Weekly article) are too often prevelant, as songs like \\"Tourniquet\\" and \\"Bring Me to Life\\" lead to more overt religous interpretations, and Amy Lee's voice does have an undeniably spritual aura to it. But often it's just ecletic, intoxicating musical fusion, with a bad-boy metal surface and the ambivilant, tormented soul at the helms that gives Evanescence it's defining substance.  <br /> <br />Songs range from the more personal, melancholy ballads of \\"Taking over Me\\", \\"My Last Breathe\\" and \\"Whisper\\", haunting ecletic-rock anthems like \\"Torniquet\\" and the more conspiciously eerie \\"Haunted\\" with spiritual undertones, riff-driven and radio-friendly metal numbers like \\"Going Under\\" and \\"Everybody's Fool\\", as well as the overwhelming, operatic opus's \\"Bring Me to Life\\" and \\"My Immortal\\" (which not-so-ironically we're the band's biggest hits).  <br /> <br />A certainly passionate, not-quite-perfect but undeniably eye-opening debut for this heavy-breathing but remarkably charismatic band (the core of which is singer Amy Lee and guitarist Ben Moody), still needing to mature but certainly having all the right tools in place to stand out from the current nu-metal wasteland.  <br /> <br />
B000000Y27|3.0|A very good album, but there are others better. If you like Wes you should have this one.
B000002H33|5.0|While \\"And Justice For All\\" may hold a very special place in my heart due to it being the first real metal album I completely worshipped, there can be no denying that \\"Master of Puppets\\" is Metallica's best release. Just as Slayer managed to reach their pinnacle in 1986 with \\"Reign in Blood\\", Metallica were at the top of their game the same year with this gem.    Kirk, Lars, James and Cliff were and always will be the ultimate Metallica line-up and this was the last time they would be in the studio together, with Cliff so tragically killed in a bus accident while on tour for the album. It hasn't aged a day either, 20 years on and this still sounds breath-takingly awesome. The production, the song-writing, the raw talent, they are all just as impressive as ever and even more so when compared to the hugely disappointing modern albums that this once giant band have excreted upon their fans.    If I break it down track by track, it's easy to see why this rocks so hard. It starts and finishes with two of the heaviest and best tracks they'd ever release in \\"Battery\\" and \\"Damage Inc.\\". There are two epic masterpieces at number 2 and 5, being the title track and \\"Disposable Heroes\\". The amazing ballad (that word seriously doesn't do it justice) \\"Sanitarium\\" at 4 and one of the greatest instrumentals ever recorded at number 7 with \\"Orion\\". That leaves only 2 tracks that I consider to be anything less than perfect, and even \\"The Thing That Should Not Be\\" and \\"Leper Messiah\\" are far above decent.    This album holds a place in metal's very elite releases. If you like metal at all, then you probably already own this. If you're new to all this thrashing wonderment and haven't heard Metallica in their prime, well do yourself a favour and put this at the top of your list.
B000003N89|5.0|Another of Diana Kralls wonderful CDs. If you like her, you should have this one. Many hours of enjoyment.
B0006HXXBA|5.0|To me this album showcases how Thrash Metal is one of the best music genres ever created. The depth, precision, aggressiveness and melody expressed on this album is fantastic. Mille Petrozza's demonic fiery rasp could instill fear into anyone who hears it. But Mille also uses some slowly spoken clean vocals on some songs which give a deceiving feeling of calm and solitude. The guitars are raw and melodic at the same time. The drums thud continuously and go at the speed of a chain gun. And the best part is the poignant lyrics and song structuring that goes with the music, making this album all the more brilliant.    Anyway on to the songs. The album is opened with the hate-fueled 'Enemy of God', a perfect song to open an album like this. It gets to the point straight off. There's no little slow acoustic intro, just a plain crushing riff. The song carries on at quite a fast pace but IMO the best part of this song is towards the end just after the solo. The riff that carries the song to a close is a great heavy one and the guitar hook that accompanies it evokes a feeling of melancholy and sadness. The words that go with the end are great to 'Enemy of God! Answer to the world! Breaking walls of heaven! A thousand fires BURN!!!!' just kickass! Next song 'Impossible Brutality' marches on with heavy riffs and slower but more pounding double bass beats. Catchy chorus and licks on this one. 'Suicide Terrorist' is up next, this song starts off with a really groovy and addictive riff and the drums also follow a groovy pattern. The lyrics on this are also quite good and sung wickedly, 'Suicide Terrorist! Random Killing! Cruelty Obssessed!'. Hmm next up 'World Anarchy' this song boasts quite a good thrash progression at the beginning but Mille's scream is a bit flat lol sounds comical. This song has a brief acoustic part in the middle that slows the song quite well without halting it, the lyrics are spoken and this part sounds almost remorseful....until he rasps 'TOTAL CHAOS! TAKES CONTROOOOL!!!' and the guitars and drums pound on. 'Dystopia' is a pretty cool straight out thrasher really. Not too much to say about it except it's a little mid-paced. Up next is 'Voices of the Dead' one of my favs because it boasts the best solo on the album. To tell you the truth this solo has got to be down as one of the best in heavy metal, i absolutely love it and you owe to yourself to check it out if you ever liked metal! The chorus is a bit yeah not good lol but the verses have good lyrical content and the song is well structured, even the metalcore-ish breakdown before the solo works well. Starts out with a bass solo which is different and likeable, the clean guitar that accompanies it is lovely and Mille's vocals are almost 'soothing' lol. The following 3 songs are all pretty much good thrashers with different tunes and strong musicianship throughout. 'Dying Race Apocalypse' follows in different fashion. The brilliantly played acoustic guitar tune used at the beginning is very catchy. The song turns into a good unconventional thrasher and the guitar hooks on this song are again quite catchy. 'Under a Total Blackened Sky' is a good song contrary to what many think. The solo is very good. The chorus will get you singing to. The guitar lick that leads this song out has a very sombre sound to it. And the last track the semi-epic 'The Ancient Plague'. This song is quite grandiose but without losing it's hard edge. The lyrics are fantastic and contain a lot of insight. This song is full of tempo changes, tone changes and contains lots of techniques. The Amazon preview will show you the slow beginning which gives you only half the full picture of this song. The song starts and stops like one of President Bush's speeches, which means frequently lol. The real treat is when the song goes into a slow acoustic breakdown and then the drum propel it into it's ending riff with such a majestic flourish, i know it sounds ridiculous but you gotta hear it. And the solois fantastic great way to end the album. The lyrics as well are great, the last words are 'And through the toxic stench of human tragedy, a saviour appears, in a red mask, in front of me.... AND SATAN IS HIS NAME!!!!' and the solo hits, absolutely kickass brilliant!!    Standout tracks for me: 'Enemy of God', 'Impossible Brutality', 'World Anarchy', 'Dystopia', 'Voices of the Dead', 'Dying Race Apocalypse', 'Under A Total Blackened Sky', 'One Evil Comes, A Million Follow' and the epic 'The Ancient Plague'.    To me this album is a pure thrash masterpiece. It's actually a very intelligent album more so than Slayer. Slayer usually revert to using quite overt anti-religious statements. But Kreator usually use suggestive phrases that give you more insight into the music. The flow of this album is great. The thing about it that works well is how it binds aggression and melody together. And the melody is not uplifting or 'happy' it is quite depressing and melancholic. To be able to balance the two together and maintain that fierce brutality is wonderful. They don't lose any aggression because of the melody, in fact it boosts it! Mille's voice again is the perfect voice to deliver that message of being an 'Enemy of God'. This album is kickass and better than anything you'll hear from the Bay Area for a long time IMO. Long live German Thrash! Ooo if you like this checkout Destruction and Sodom they rock to. My last words are to buy this album you will definetly not regret it! Hope that was helpful to you.    \m/
B0000046KM|5.0|An outstanding album, Shirley at her best. All can enjoy this CD. It's too bad she no longer is with us.
B000E8NRR6|5.0|The bonus DVD that comes with this package is, indeed, playable in a standard DVD player -- I'm listening to it right now. <br /> <br />An \\"Audio Setup\\" menu allows you to select from \\"DTS 5.1 Surround Sound\\", \\"Dolby Digital Stereo\\", and \\"Dolby Digital Surround Sound\\".  I am listening to the DTS version, and it is superb, though not as good as Kamakiriad! <br /> <br />There may be DVD-A material on this disc as well -- I can't say because I do not have a DVD-A player. <br /> <br />One thing the DVD lacks is lyrics, which is a disappointment.  The Kamakiriad DVD (which I highly recommend) has lyrics, along with other bonus material, but you cannot display them while the music is playing -- how dumb is that?
0553573403|4.0|What IS it lately, with the huge epic stories in which there is an overtone of darkness and a completely pessimistic view of the human psyche?<br /><br />I know this book has been out for a long time, and I've seen several people raving about the series. The writing is excellent, and the story flows....no complaints there, but sometimes it's really hard to keep reading, because I just want to go cry. It is definitely a tribute to the writer that he has created characters that are just despicable. They all do horrible things to each other, and even the \\"good\\" guys aren't always all that admirable. Much like real life, actually.<br /><br />The problem is, there never seems to be anything positive that happens to balance out all the negativity. The characters we're rooting for, like Jon Snow, are constantly pushed down and stomped on, until you just want someone to stop being so damn honorable and DO something!<br /><br />I want to keep reading the series to find out what happens to these characters, but I just know it's going to be something awful. Somehow I'm sure that there will not be a happy ending for these books!
B0002DB0FO|5.0|I really loved Everwood and cannot believe they have cancelled the show.  The characters were believable, the storylines, credible.  No show has touched our family so deeply.  I am hoping they will renew the show, but until then I will watch these DVD's and hope they will release the subsequent seasons.   <br /> <br />Our three kids are grown and gone from home, but all three watched Everwood regularly.  It appealed to all ages, not just the older generations.  My son and his wife missed the last episode and were very disappointed that it will not replay on the WB.  He is hoping for the last season on DVD.  <br />
0143034901|5.0|This book falls into a tiny minority among the books I've read.  The category is called:<br /><br />Books that were so absorbing I started them over the moment I finished them.<br /><br />The other books on that list are:  The Sea, The Sea, by Iris Murdoch, The Waterland, by Graham Swift, Oryx and Crake, by Margaret Atwood, and Midnight's Children, by Salman Rushdie.<br /><br />The character development made the difference.  By the end of the book the characters were so well developed that I almost felt like I was in the book, like I was one of their friends.  I simply wasn't able to let them go when the book was over and I had to start again.
B000F7CMRW|5.0|Never saw this in movies, knew I wanted to see it on video. I did and had to have it. Love this movie, its close to whats going on today to a sort. I never looked at the clock once, like I do with some videos wondering when it will end. This keeps you eyes glued to screen, no getting up for a quick sec to get water without pausing. When I bought this on amazon, now whole family wants to borrow it. I recommend it to anyone wanting to watch a movie and not yawning or sleeping. A+
015626224X|5.0|You think you're poor when you must borrow money to pay the rent. But just imagine pawning your last set of clean clothes so you can buy some day-old bread, then when you have  nothing left for the pawn shop, going without food for days. Imagine finally finding work and having to toil in a steamy basement for 18 hours, never getting enough sleep, and making only enough money to live in bug-ridden room you share with someone else.<br /><br />This little book, first published in 1933, is aptly described by its title, as the narrator is \\"down and out in Paris and London.\\" We get an inside look at what it's like to be hungry all the time in the mean streets of Paris and to survive working in the dirty kitchens of its cafes and hotels. The narrator moves to London, thinking he has a job lined up, but finds himself once again \\"down and out.\\" This time he becomes a tramp, moving from one filthy rooming house to another and finally tramping from one \\"spike\\" to another. A spike is a place where tramps can stay overnight, but they are really jails, where two men share a cell that does not even have a bed, just a cold floor and a few dirty blankets. The men are locked in for the night, then given tea and two slices of bread in the morning. They cannot stay two nights in a row in the same spike so they must keep moving to another one.<br /><br />We meet some fascinating characters in London, including a \\"screever,\\" a street artist who draws on the sidewalk, sometimes including political satire. He lives off the coins he gets from passer-bys. We learn of many ways around the \\"no begging\\" law in London as the homeless and hungry use their ingenuity to survive in a society that made little provision for helping the poor.<br /><br />We learn almost nothing about the narrator and the story has no plot, but I found this book a fascinating tale nonetheless. It must be unique in its subject matter because I don't know how else you would get this kind of close-up of life in these conditions of extreme poverty. The narrator does not indulge in self-pity, but rather simply describes his life during this period in Paris and London. I found especially interesting his observation that those times when well-meaning people gave him and his fellow tramps free food (often along with a lecture or religious service) he said he knew they should have been grateful, \\"but we weren't.\\"<br /><br />In the last chapter, we get some suggestions for making life more humane for the poor and we see the seeds of some of Orwell's later work.<br /><br />This book was a reminder for me that there have been worse times to live than the present and that the poor have at times in the past been even poorer than today. Orwell found no soup kitchens, no food stamp programs, no charitable organizations gathering donated food to distribute to the hungry. Old people who were poor had nothing to look forward to but worsening conditions and an early death. While the narrator took it all in stride, I found this an appalling picture of a society that lacked any safety net for working people who could be exploited at will and discarded onto the streets if they could no longer work.

B000BTC5LW|3.0|This DVD had enormous potential, judging by Gilmour's 2002(?)solo DVD release. It came nowhere close to meeting this potential, but it is still a worthy buy for hardcore fans. My first problem with the DVD (and that which I view to be most glaring) is the mix. The sound quality on this DVD is absolutely horrid; at times the sound is literally melded together into an indistinguishable wall of noise. Besides this, the fact it is not in widescreen is lame, especially given Gilmour's reasoing for delaying the release for so long (they were trying to make the film look better on big screen tvs \\"which everyone seems to have these days.\\") And one final, yet still resounding, complaint is the extensive reliance of the Floyd members on backup musicians. Nick Mason hardly does anything; instead all of the most exciting percussion comes from some no-name wearing a headband and an Armani jacket. Simliarly with Gilmour- although Gilmour plays most of the solos, and old man with white hair plays the lead throughout most of the songs. Combine these factors with the (glaring)  lack of Roger Waters and what you have is a Floyd cover band playing all of your favorites, albeit doing a great job.
0596009208|5.0|I like the approach the author has taken to lighten up a potentially heavy subject. I am using a number of texts in an effort to transition from COBOL and Visual Basic to Java in my career. This particular book has been most helpful in presenting the basics and in helping to making my conversion to Java a bit more enjoyable. I look forward to referring to this book often and to benifiting from other Head First titles as well.<br /><br />Thank you, Kathy, for your excellent work.
B00005JLYW|1.0|This film has plenty of mindless action, impossible (to the point of laughable) stunts, and a healthy supply of sexual inuendo. It has all of the ingredients of a large scale \\"jane bond\\" (times three) but the finished product will still leave you feeling like you just ate some really bad fast food. A pounding headache is also quite normal after a viewing since complete suspension of disbelief is required. <br /> <br />The \\"camp\\" level is turned up so high that it doesn't mix well with the seriousness of the violence and action. Or is it the other way around? Something \\"fun\\" could have been done with this material, these actors, and the money spent on FX. But instead we're treated to a collection of loud, mind numbing, rediculous stunts all held together by smirks, quips, winks, and a plot as thick as dental floss. It all comes down to a horrible script lacking any true sense of \\"fun\\". For those who argue that this film actually lives up to every \\"simple\\" thing that it's \\"supposed to be\\" - let me refine my review to just one \\"simple\\" sentence: <br /> <br />This movie is a big piece of crap for really, really stupid people! <br /> <br />-JM
0765342294|5.0|I've read the whole series, and it is definately what i would call some of the best sci-fi i've ever read. i am personally more partial to Bean's side of the story (the Shadow parallel series), but ender is always an entertaining and page-turning read.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I started this search for Firefly after seeing Serenity.  I had no idea this series even existed.  Once the series arrived and I sat down to watch, I told myself \\"Remember this is not a feature and it can't be as good as the movie, so don't be disappointed\\".  I couldn't have been more wrong.  If you liked the movie, you will love the series.  If after watching you are like me and feel wronged by the fact that the series was cancelled than find a fanclub, website, or whatever and voice your opinion.  A strong fanbase is how the movie got made in the first place.  Maybe if we are loud enough the series could be brought back or at least a sequel to Serenity will be made.

I've been moved to do all three.
0425152251|4.0|Truly an excellent and engaging history of philosophy written so as to avoid \\"dry textbook syndrome.\\"  The novel part turns a bit weird toward the end and the treatment of the earlier philosophers is better than the more recent philosophers but, overall, the author does an outstanding job of teaching a beginning history of philosophy course in a highly enjoyable format.
B00000JY1X|5.0|It would be tough to name another indie album that features a more expansive array of musical styles or more ingenious, heartbreaking and funny songs about love.  <br /> <br />Stephen Merritt is the sort of lyricist -- like Leonard Cohen -- who is a poet first and musician second, though it would be possible to tag 20-some songs here that are wonderfully listenable as pure music. <br /> <br />The Magnetic Fields have captured every nuance of courtship and every facet of romantic absurdity as in, eg. \\"The Night You Couldn't Remember (is the Night I'll Never Forget.\\"  <br /> <br />On the other hand, are many songs that will bring tears to your eyes without warning because they are so tender and empathetic. Stephen Merrit is like an alternative, lo-fi therapist who, in 69 totally varied songs, appears to understand anyone -- male or female -- who has ever loved, or tried and failed. <br /> <br />It's also rare to find an album with a playlist so complex that you never tire of it. I've had my copy for over two years and still discover new material to love with each listing: a riff, an arrangement, a phrase, even a title. <br /> <br />In a country where people of all ages are more isolated, I can't think of another album that gives us the courage to connect with other people. These quirky songs honor our tenacious efforts to reach out -- and the rewards and consequences of trying. <br /> <br />While some listeners might be a bit disappointed in the fair dynamic range of the production, that quality is a choice the group made with intent. Love is ultimately rough around the edges, even when it is deep. It is occasionally a complete bore. It embraces routine even as it rebels against it.  It is impossible to perfect because we can't change other people. <br /> <br />At it's core, that's what so many of these wonderful songs address and it is a balm to the ear, the mind and the heart that the Magnetic Fields invested so much in this terrific, well-loved album (now availablein three separate releases as well as the boxed set.) For my money, Volume 1 is the best of the  bunch musically, while the lyrics of Volume three are laugh-out-loud hysterical. <br /> <br />Warts and all -- five strong stars, and a great deal at this price.

B000HBK3MM|4.0|There is nothing like hearing a fresh new artist enter into the music market.  What is more refreshing is a fresh new crossover artist.  Perhaps it is the fact that Corinne Bailey Rae is a crossover artist that is her appeal. R&B artists will want to claim her solely as R&B, but listening to the phenomenal opening track \\"Like A Star\\" proves that Bailey Rae is as much Erykah Badu as she is a classic jazz singer or Norah Jones counterpart.  Her guitar laden debut is exceptional and for the most part it is an enthralling listen.  That isn't to say that it's perfect because it has moments where it isn't particular luring but more so background music.  Despite this minor flaw, what CORINNE BAILEY RAE always does is sooth the listener and draw the listener into Bailey Rae's soothing mix of adult-alt, neo-soul, singer-songwriter, traditional pop/vocal, and whatever else the listener may categorize her style as.<br /><br />As stated previously, \\"Like A Star\\" is an exceptional way to open the album. The track starts with a minimal approach with only Bailey Rae's vocals accompanied by simple guitar work. Simple it may be at the onset, it is pure in every facet. Furthermore, the simplicity of the production from the onset makes the listener listen to Corinne Bailey Rae's self penned lyrics, which are exceptionally penned at that. The track picks up more momentum with the addition of drum programming, bass, keyboards, and strings.  It is definitely a winning performance.<br /><br />From a first listen, \\"Enchantment\\" may seem like a track that is meant more as background music.  After several listens, the track doesn't live up to \\"Like A Star\\" or flagship lead single \\"Put Your Records On\\", but it is very enjoyable and soothing to the soul.  \\"Enchantment's\\" production is very beautiful, subtle, and soulful.  Bailey Rae's tender vocals sit well on this track.  The chorus is very beautiful.<br /><br />\\"Put Your Records On\\" is the easy favorite of Bailey Rae's entire debut.  From the onset, you think you are listening to a mix between Erykah Badu, Sade, and Jack Johnson.  Once Rae finishes the first verse, for the first time on the entire album we hear a bit of grit being asserted by the singer. The track is the perfect track;  it has the sassiness of an R&B singer, the purity of a singer-songwriter, the liveliness of an adult-alt rock song, and the embodiment of a jazz singer.<br /><br />\\"Till It Happens To You\\" sees Bailey Rae play more into her soul facet.  The rhythm of the song sounds like the rhythm supporting any classic soul star.  The chord progression fits this song very well and everything is in the pocket.  \\"Trouble Sleeping\\" returns Rae to more adult-alt rock sounds.  The brass and orchestra featured in the production is very fitting and Rae sounds as strong as ever here.<br /><br />While there is nothing completely droll on this album, there are moments when you don't feel as enthralled or connected at the beginning.  Tracks 6-11 are fine (\\"Call Me When You Get This\\", \\"'Choux Pastry Heart\\", \\"Breathless\\", \\"I'd Like To\\", \\"Butterfly\\", and \\"Seasons Change\\" though maybe not as great as tracks 1-5 (\\"Like A Star\\", \\"Enchantment\\", \\"Put Your Records On\\", \\"Till It Happens To You\\", or \\"Trouble Sleeping\\".  \\"Butterfly\\" of the group is the true stand out, while \\"'Choux Pastry Heart\\" shows a singer-songwriter sounding Corinne Bailey Rae reminiscent of ealier Nelly Furtado among others.  Interesting concerning track 9, \\"I'd Like To\\", however is the hip-hop/funk beat, the first time that occurs on the generally soft-soul, quite-soul of CORINNE BAILEY RAE.<br /><br />Overall, Corinne Bailey Rae has made her mark with CORINNE BAILEY RAE.  It's not the perfect album, but it is pretty good in my opinion and definitely good enough to give the crossover artist the attention she deserves.t.  From the onset, you think you are listening to a mix between Erykah Badu, Sade, and Jack Johnson.

0385504209|3.0|I thought the book read well, and was somewhat interesting but was very contrived and \\"Harry Potter\\" ish for me, although I have to admit that I personally find non-fiction far more interesting and fascinating than a made up story with predictable conclusions.  Not a bad read, but I didn't see what all the fuss was about.
B00005JOX6|4.0|Typically, an Adam Sandler movie combines humor with a subtle lesson on life. Click is a very funny movie that delivers a powerful message. The movie makes you laugh at times and cry at others. The idea of the universal remote controlling life is original and the fact that Sandler gets the remote from the Beyond section of Bed, Bath and Beyond is hilarious (You kind of wonder what the Beyond is for anyway..). To my great surprise, by the end of the movie, I had been left with a deep meaning of \\"family\\" that kept me thinking for days.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|This collection of the four Alien films plus the bonus features really puts you back into the sci-fi, thriller and horror roots that the Alien movies carry.  What was seen through the human eye inside the theater in 1979 will now be known as a sci-fi and horror film icon.  The movie that started it all with a handfull of frightened viewers made this movie what it is today.  A movie icon.  Four different directors showed their Alien visions by directing these movies.  The last three showed their Alien vision to keep the franchise going into what it is known as today.  Unfortunately after the final minutes of Aliens the franchise began to slow down.  It was still okay to watch because once you have seen the first two you would want to know what happens next.  Ridley Scott the director who started this franchise showed his vision for Alien.  Alien is a compelling jaw dropping film that showed its roots for terror.  After the start of franchises such as Friday the 13th or Nightmare on Elm Street comes the sequils.  The sequils following Alien were made continuing such success Alien has made.  Of course Alien is one of the movies that shows sci-fi's darker side.  The story of seven crew members on a space ship heading towards earth who encounter an Alien cast away opening the door to terrifying science fiction shown in four films. <br /> <br />ALIEN-If there wasn't an Aliens this would be the best film in the franchise.  Comes extremely close to being the best one.  What started it all: The Alien, Ripley, and the suberb sci-fi terror.  If you were to see all the other ones first without seeing Alien first you would be lost until you did see this one.  Not criticizing anyone who has seen the others without seeing this one.  As said comes extremely close to being the best.  So close it gets 4.99.9 out of 5.  Just needed another.1 to go. <br /> <br />ALIENS-The best one in the franchise.  Over five decades later Ripley awakes from her sleep since the Alien wrecked havok onthe Nostromo.  There Ripley and a team of marines discover more Aliens and begin to fight to survive.  Not everyone survives of course as known throughout other movies like these.  Ripley protects a girl named Newt through this second round of Alien madness.  More action contained in this movie than Alien in my belief.  James Cameron did a very excellent job directing this and made this sequil as part of what he is known of.  Being a master action and drama director. <br /> <br />ALIEN 3-So obviously what movie script writters, movie producers, and movie directors have on their minds when they make a third sequil in a franchise is to make it as good as the first two.  Obviously it might not be as good as the first two (which Alien 3 wasn't as good as the first two) but mainly the ones making a third sequil want it to just not suck.  Alien 3 did not suck but it was sort of close to not being good at all.  From here they should have stopped the franchise unless they could come up with something better to add onto the franchise.  What the script writter did was just make an excuse to just have Ripley be the only sole survivor of another round of Alien madness.  But there were two others.  Hicks and Newt.  But maybe they were not meant to be in the setting that Alien 3 was in.  Once I heard about this set not seeing the movies I saw the Alien 3 trailer.  Sigourtney goes bald and I was thinking did she shave just because she wanted to?  No.  She shaved because they wanted to (the people behind the story of Alien 3).  Crash an escape pod because of an Alien stowaway if you will but if Ripley survives shouldn't the others survive as well?  The least favorite in the series. <br /> <br />ALIEN: RESSURECTION-After Alien's least successful film comes the second least favorite in the series.  The reason why this was better than Alien 3 was because of its action.  A very big dissapointment was to see Ripley become a clone.  When they should have stopped after Aliens, they continued with the two worst additions in the franchise that were still okay.  But if they were to have a third sequil then they should have stopped there.  This was still better than the third release but a cloned Ripley made me dissapointed.  The end of Alien 3 could have made a good end to the franchise in my opinion.  Here the movie makers of this film semmed like they made the others especially the first one dissapear into the would of classics. <br /> <br />The bonus features help make this box set a must own for any Alien fans and not just the die hards. <br /> <br />The movie ratings: <br />ALIEN-4.99.9/5  The perfect start.  Lives in the world of classics but never dissapeared. <br />ALIENS-5/5  The perfect sequil. <br />ALIEN 3-2.5/5  Not completely bad.  Still okay but my least favorite <br />ALIEN: RESSURECTION-3/5  The second worst in the series.  Still okay. <br /> <br />Overall this is the must have set for the Alien fan.

B00004Y6O9|5.0|I wrote a superb review two days ago, it was posted yesterday and now its gone, so I'll write another review (without insulting more people).:<br /><br />Van Halen, One of the greatest debuts of all time.  Sure, rock was healthy at this time: Ac/Dc had just stepped into the rock circuit and were making a name for themselves, Led Zeppelin's recent album \\"Presence\\" made it to #1 (I think a first for the band), Kissmania was taking over America, and Boston's debut became the fastest selling debut in history.  Also notbale were tour acts like Ted Nugent, Blue Oyster Cult, Nazareth, and the legendary Black Sabbath, who weren't real succesful record wise but had amazing status as touring giants.  But then punk occured and real rock was in jeopardy.  The solution?  These four guys: David Lee Roth(had to put him first to satisfy his big ego), Eddie Van Halen(who in every public poll taken has beaten the likes of Angus Young, Eric Clapton, and yes even your beloved Jimmy Page), Alex Van Halen(who is a pretty sick drummer), and Micheal Anthony(who should be nicknamed the 'god of backup vocals')  Because of these guys rock n' roll was given a second chance to live, and a chance for retard groups like the Clash to shut the hell up.<br /><br />I hate writing debut reviews, because you have to say what the band introduced, which takes friggn forever, so I'm going to write a normal album review:<br /><br />1.Runnin with the Devil (3:32): THE INTRODUCTION OF EXTREMELY LOUD MUSIC!  MY BROTHER WOKE ME UP TO THIS ONCE ON FULL BLAST AND I HAD EAR DAMAGE!  The quality on this is amazing, in sounds like this song was recorded just yesterday.  While Eddie's solo is not his best it still has that trademark wail to it that Eddie is so acclaimed to.<br /><br />2.Eruption (1:42): THE MOST AMAZING STUDIO RECORDED GUITAR SOLO EVER!  All three instruments are featured on here but the most obvious are Eddie and Alex.  Alex drumbeats set the path for Eddie's amazing fingertap solo, much like a metal blitzkreig that kills everything in its path(?)!<br /><br />3.You Really Got Me (2:37): They took a good song and made it better.  Listen to the old one then listen to this, there is a definite improvement in it, it is like the boys recreated the song from scratch.<br /><br />4.Ain't Talkin' 'bout Love (3:37): The most popular song off this album, has a very Kiss-like atmosphere to it with heavier riffs and Dave's trademark falsetto scream.<br /><br />5.I'm the One (3:44): Big band is back again in metal form!!  You see many people complain about Van Halen destroying music, on the contrary: they brought the music back!  This song is a perfect example of how Van Halen resurrected old 50's music to create a unique sound.<br /><br />6.Jamie's Cryin' (3:30): Probably the first hair metal song ever created (a pretty good if it is).<br /><br />7.Atomic Punk (3:00): This song was created to put salt in the wound of punk music.  You see Van Halen created this extremely heavy and virtuosic song to reveal the kindergarten music talent of punk bands to the world by saying \\"we are punk, times 1000000\\").  I got that from Eddie's solo, which not only has 100x the sound of a punk solo, but also 100x the speed.<br /><br />8.Feel Your Love Tonight (3:40): Pop-influenced song, can't think of anything else, it's a good listen.<br /><br />9.Little Dreamer (3:22): Sounds like an Aerosmith influenced sound throughout with a dark atmosphere.  Ironic, considering it is a song about succeeding where others say you will fail.<br /><br />10.Ice Cream Man (3:18): A John Brim cover, though many mistake it for a VH original song.  I think the acoustic intro was done by both David Lee Roth and Eddie, kind of interesting to hear the lighter side of the band after all their electric songs.  Then halfway through the band turns their instruments on to create a great climax to a soulful song.<br /><br />11.On Fire (3:01): An intense closer, not very common on a Van Halen album.  The guitar work onhere is one of the most copied sounds in metal history.<br /><br />Van Halen ranking:<br /><br />1.Fair Warning<br /><br />2.Women and Children First<br /><br />3.Van Halen<br /><br />4.1984<br /><br />5.Van Halen II<br /><br />6.Balance<br /><br />7.5150<br /><br />8.OU812<br /><br />9.Diver Down<br /><br />10.FOr Unlawful Carnal Knowledge<br /><br />11.Live: Right Here, Right Now<br /><br />12.Van Halen 3ory. <br /> <br />Van Halen ranking: <br />1.Fair Warning <br />2.Women and Children First <br />3.Van Halen <br />4.1984 <br />5.Van Halen II <br />6.Balance <br />7.5150 <br />8.OU812 <br />9.Diver Down <br />10.FOr Unlawful Carnal Knowledge <br />11.Live: Right Here, Right Now <br />12.Van Halen 3
0060599847|5.0|This is just full of excellent information and I have listen twice and I still have a lot of information I want to gain from reading it again. I hope I can make at least some of these principles a habit. This would be a great gift to give new people starting out in the business world. I highly recommend it and wish I could have read it years ago.
B000003TA4|1.0|First off, I am glad that someone else besides myself noticed that a bunch of NARROW MINDED LED ZEPPELIN, BEATLES, ROLLING STONERS FANS WHO HAVE NOTHING TO DO IN THEIR SPARE TIME BUT BASH MUSIC BETTER THAN THEIRS FLOODING OTHER BANDS WORK WITH NEGATIVE REVIEWS!!! THIS TICKS US OFF!!<br /><br />Review mode:<br /><br />Unlike all of those queerboes who have mold statues of Jimmy Page and Robert Plant in their gardens, I have an honest reason to not liking this album: It just isn't that good. I usually slander an album to death but after seeing the chaos BEATLEMANIA has caused here I will try to be as nice and inoffensive as possible:<br /><br />Smells Like Teen Spirit was actually a sweet song, for the first 40 times you hear it at least, then it gets old. Come as you are, knowing Kurt Cobain he probably meant that as a sexual reference so no thanks. Lithium sounds like a butthole cracking, Kurt wants to Breed with his cousin Polly In Bloom. 'Territorial Pissings' why don't you name it 'Possessive Urination' for zeus's sake! Listening to this collection of \\"ohh, im a sick dirty little boy who likes singing sick songs that have sucky music in it\\" makes me want to Drain my brain.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I am definitely not one of those metalheads who are like \\"arr, I hate Nirvana, it destroyed metal!\\" Wrong, Kurt Cobain didn't kill metal, Bret Micheals and \\"Every Rose has It's Thorn\\" killed metal! THE PROBLEM I HAVE WITH NIRVANA IS THAT THEY SUCKED IN DOING IT; if Bon Scott came back from the dead and and Ac/Dc killed Glam Metal, I would bring out the champagne on the spot. But Nirvana made extremely crappy music and succeeded(well it is better than glam at least) and not only did they succeed but somehow 15 million retards approve of this album.<br /><br />p.s.:Ten by Pearl Jam sold a million more than Nevermind, so ha!
B0002XL35G|3.0|This is a fine 90 minute movie. Unfortunately it clocks in at around two and a half hours. What starts out as a slow moody pace fairly quickly becomes dull and the dialogue, which in this kind of movie is so important, tends to be a little flat. That said, it's certainly worth watching. Visually it's beautiful, the soundtrack has a nice lazy Texas twang to it, the story is interesting and there are some pretty good performances, though I don't think it's Harry Dean Stanton's best work. So if you haven't seen it go ahead and pick up a copy and watch it.  <br />Just make sure you've had a nap first
B000002JSR|5.0|I just experienced a mindmelding experience, suddenly this album is amazing!  Give it a few listens, it is actually better than some of Led Zeppelin's actual released songs.  Even though it is a rarity album it smokes \\"In Through the Outdoor\\", in my opinion if they put \\"Wearing and Tearing\\", \\"Ozone Baby\\", and \\"Darlene\\" on \\"In Through the Outdoor\\" in place of \\"Carouselramba\\", the album would have been a major success.  But they didn't, and now its too late
0553579908|5.0|This series keeps you on the edge of your seat.  It is not your typical fantasy novel.  I would reccomend this book to anyone and I can't tell you why it isn't typical because it will ruin the surprises for you.
B000F5GNX8|4.0|KKBB is one wild trip of a movie.  Dark, comic and genre satirizing, it takes you over and over again on one crazy trip after another.  Downey is excellent here and his narration is an example of perfect deadpan humor.  I have never been a big fan of Kilmer, but here he is quite funny and a lot less hammy than he has been in the past.  They, along woth Monaghan make a great comic, if bloody, trio.  The film is also gorgeously photographed and beautiful look at.  Great, breezy entertainment!
B0000AUHQT|5.0|I have read Great Gatsby easily 15 times and I think this movie rendition is excellent. What makes it so good is the casting. Redford is perfect as Gatsby as is Farrow as Daisy and Dern as Tom. Waterston is just as I pictured Nick. The music is well chosen and the costuming is superb. The only thing I missed at the end was not hearing the last words of the book \\"so we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.\\" (I did that from memory; if not exact, it should be close)
B000FS9FCG|5.0|This movie is perfect. What can I say? Rarely does a movie based on a comic book get it right on the level that this film does. Usually with movies like X-Men or Fantastic Four, there are so many characters and storylines that certain elements get lost or becoming confusing. That problem doesn't exist in this film. The storyline is just brilliant. It really makes you think about politics and the government that exist in the real world as well as the media. And it makes you question whether or not terrorism can ever be justified.
B000001XN2|5.0|This 1962 Vienna State Opera performance of Trovatore is now a document of a new Golden Age of opera. Price and Corelli had taken the Metropolitan by storm the previous year in the same roles and the vocal beauty, strength and ardor that propelled them to international stardom are much in evidence, particularly in the former's assumption of Leonora--Price even throws in a few extra high Cs in the \\"Miserere\\" for good measure. Her two big arias \\"Tacea la notte\\" and \\"D'amor sull' ali rosee\\" are replete with her characteristic shimmering vibrato and creamy tone. Corelli sings with big, gorgeous tone and with more care in phrasing than in some of his other recorded performances-only his concluding high note at the end of the third act seems somewhat pressed. Azucena and the Conte di Luna are in the more than capable hands of Giulietta Simionato and Ettore Bastianini.<br /><br />Despite the ease with which the dictum that \\"all Trovatore needs is the four greatest singers in the world\\" is met, ultimately the driving force behind this night is Karajan, who gives this fast-moving melodrama exactly the propulsion it needs without slighting the lyrical moments. The Vienna Philharmonic responds with a razor-sharp rendition of the score. Against such virtues the faults of a live recording can easily be forgiven: mono sound and some questionable balances (the \\"offstage\\" harp in Manrico's first solo sounds as if it is about two feet from the microphone). Most of the traditional stage cuts are observed as well: thus the second verses of both Leonora's and Manrico's cabalettas are missing, as well as the whole of Leonora's last-act cabaletta, \\"Tu vedrai.\\" Nevertheless, for opera lovers, this is a Trovatore not to be missed.
1563899426|3.0|i first read this collection a few months ago. i was delighted that willingham had this amazing idea...but the problem seems to be in execution for the first book...the story is kind of like a pulpy detective series...even down to a parlour scene in which the hero explains how he solved the crime...the reason i've only given it 3 stars and that i say it's a good start is because: <br /> <br />a) it is in fact enjoyable... <br />b) i've caught up and read the rest (and they get better each volume) <br />c) i want you to read it. <br /> <br />stepping away from this book for a moment, this series is entirely worthy of your time and money if you ever enjoyed fairy tales...willingham masterfully takes what were once 2 dimensional characters and gives them personality...the problem is that you can't (or shouldn't) read the story without starting here...i highly recommend the series, but this is the worst book in it...
B00006I53S|2.0|Great range and the USM provides quite and fast auto focus. The IS works well. <br /> <br />While the lense takes sharp photos at extreme zoon at all other settings the pictures were fuzzy. Not sure if its bad glass or a problem with auto focusing. <br /> <br />Not worth the money but it may be that I got a bad copy of the lense like so many others here have. <br /> <br />I wanted this lense to work but ended up returning it. <br /> <br />Had some issues returning it but as always Amazon worked with me and the lense is on its way back.
B00000I3JM|5.0|I am not going to go on too much at length about The Blue Nile and A Walk Across the Rooftops other than to say I first heard it in 1984 and to this day I still consider it one of the most brilliant albums I have ever heard.  If you have any musical intelligence, you will recognize it immediately.
0380799006|5.0|After reading this book I realized I was doing it all wrong!  Once I started implementing the authors techniques, it was amazing how quickly the fighting no longer escalated to \\"knock outs\\".  My son and daughter were able to resolve some of their discrepancies on their own with very little involvement on my part!  I truly recommend this book if you've got fighting kids, which is most, if not all of us parents!  Then go on to read by the same authors, \\"How to talk so kids will listen and how to listen so kids will talk\\".  Both of these books made a huge difference in my house!
B0002IQNAG|1.0|My friends and I talked about watching the new version of Dawn of the Dead, but we couldn't get a hold of it, so we ended up with the old version. I click on this site and saw the 4 stars average rating. But unfortunately it wasn't worthy of its rating. I can not believe that anyone would rank this movie higher than maximum 4. It was supposed to be a horror movie, but where was the horror? I only need three words to describe this piece of crap; silly, predictable and funny. These things should not occur in a horror movie, but here they do, and this ruins the movie. The acting is so bad, that I would gladly watch a Steven Seagal movie after watching this. The zombies were so idiotic and not scary at all. The dialogue was even worse, though there are a FEW good quotes. The special effects are the only really good thing about this movie, because they are quite good but not the best. But sadly this doesn't save the movie. <br /> <br />A horror movie without horror has failed, and this sure does. 2/5  <br />
1558908846|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. Stallone does a good job in his role as Dredd, based on the comic book character. All the acting was good, the plot was great and it combined action and humor well. Very entertaining.
B0000C1733|5.0|I wish \\"Around the world\\" and \\"Zephyr Song\\" would have been on it, but other than that I have no problems with this greatest hits compilation. RHCP have produced some mindblowing tunes and most of them are featured on this disc. If you haven't bought any RHCP albums before then go and get this one now!
0783222149|5.0|Great suspense movie with great \\"stars\\".  Kevin Bacon was outstanding as usual.  Definately worth the purchase.
630463949X|3.0|There is some great music here, of course, and with new songs like \\"Sweet Girl,\\" \\"Bleed to Love Her,\\" \\"and \\"My Little Demon,\\" along with terrific renditions of \\"Big Love\\" and \\"Go Insane,\\" Fleetwood Mac proves that it's not just a jukebox. Still, \\"The Dance\\" doesn't feel like a Fleetwood Mac concert; they did a much better job of capturing that atmosphere in 1982's Mirage video and the more recent \\"Live in Boston.\\"  <br /> <br />If you own \\"The Dance\\" CD, though, this DVD does contain a bit more material, including renditions of \\"Gypsy\\" and \\"Go Insane.\\"
B000BB1MI2|2.0|This was one of those movies that I couldn't wait to end...but I went because the kids wanted to see it.  I normally like movies with Johnny Depp, but not this one!  I will give it 2 stars because Johnny Depp's acting was still good (I just did not like the story line...and neither did my kids...they said it was too \\"boring\\").  Maybe younger kids (ages 4-6) might like it better.
B000000W5P|4.0|I think this and Tattoo You are all you need from this hugely overrated band. Some Girls is great and has a few terrific songs in Shattered. Get it, but stay far away from the BIGGER BANG album that sucks big time. <br />
B000F3A7LE|5.0|The sticker on the front of the package that the CD comes in calls this the \\"Sergeant Pepper of avant punk.\\"  I wouldn't go quite that far, but this is surely an overlooked masterpiece.         I had put off buying the old cd version of this album because of warnings that alternate cuts had replaced those appearing on the original vinyl version.  The first disk of this double cd reissue appears to be the same (or close) to the original album.  The version of \\"Here Comes the Flood\\" presented here, much better than the version appearing on the Peter Gabriel cd, makes this worth purchasing.  Several other cuts, most notable \\"You Burn Me Up I'm a Cigarette\\" and \\"Mary\\" are also top rate.  Some of the songs don't work (for me at least) but I prefer a cd that takes chances, even if not everything succeeds, over one that plays it safe with the same old same old.         I haven't yet listened to the second cd but it doesn't matter - disk 1 is sufficient for a 5 star rating.    Buy and enjoy.
B000002J09|1.0|Led Zeppelin are one of the worst bands of the 70's. They only made 1 decent song in Stairway To Heaven, which deserves 2 stars.<br /><br />I can't believe the top sellers of the world are Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, and The Beatles as they all suck. Even Appetite for<br /><br />Destruction by Guns N' Roses is better than this. Go get that.<br /><br />That rocks, this sucks!! Throw is in your trash can immediately.
1932100660|5.0|This is the most important and impactful book I have ever read. The science of it all is incredible and totally makes sense. And it is written so superbly that it reads like a fascinating detective novel!  I was a confused Atkins/South Beach meat eater, but after this book I am a committed vegan. I will no longer put short term weight goals ahead of eating properly. I am down right scared. It may be too late for me, but I feel that giving my daughter the gift of veganism and good health will be one of the best things that I can teach her. Dr. Campbell has passed on a lifetime of good science and ethics, and is not afraid to take on - everyone!! - other scientists, US medicine, media, industry, etc. There is so much confusing information out there, but once you read this book, and all the science behind it, I believe you too will be convinced of the relationship between what you eat and preventable diseases.
B00004Y6NW|1.0|This is probably the worst Dire Straits album of all theirs. Every of their other albums are fine. This is the only bad 1 which contains several of the worst songs they ever recorded. <br />I will have to say that Sultans of Swing is the only decent song on this terrible album. Listen to that, the other songs are terrible. And one more thing, Why is it so popular?????????? <br />
B000059RL3|5.0|For the serious MG fan, this is a must have. Why? Because the additional material is more than a filler used to drive up the profit in the CD. The \\"Original Detroit Mix\\" seems only slightly different than the \\"Original LP\\" release, but after listening a few times, the differences are subtle, but distinct. I like them both, but think I would have also chosen the \\"Original LP\\" release over the original mix. The live material is also nice. The recording is clean and the band tight. Can I get a right on, brother!
B00004XQP4|5.0|To the reviewer below me. <br />What is your big problem? Your opinion about Green Day is not needed. The bands you hate are legends, and the bands you love are really awful.  <br /> <br />Anyway, Warning is great..buy it today.
B000FS9FC6|5.0|V For Vendetta is one of the best movies of our time. I'll admit that I haven't read the graphic novel, but I don't think that should take away from this film. It's simply brilliant. The idea of a totalitarian government controlling every aspect of people's lives really makes one think of what it really means to be free. The acting is wonderful, with Hugo Weaving perfectly portraying the suave yet menacing character of V. His silky voice and charismatic words make one forget that he is, in fact, a terrorist with the intention of carrying out Guy Fawkes' failed attempt to destroy Parliament in the 1600's. Natalie Portman is great in her role of Evey Hammond, evolving from a cautious everyday woman trying to live her life in peace to a strong-willed woman who learns to overcome her fear. She isn't like most of the female leads in movies like this where she's only a victim caught in the middle of everything. And let's not forget Stephen Rea as Inspector Eric Finch, the skeptical yet determined officer trying to follow V before his threatened attack on Parliament on the 5th of November. The side stories are very interesting and piece the whole plot together in a web of illusioned coincidence. Never before has a movie given me chills the way V For Vendetta did at the very end, and I won't spoil it for those who have yet to see it. Overall, it's perfect for those with an open mind who are looking for something very deep, thought-provoking, and moving.
B000000OQF|5.0|Appetite for destruction is a great album. Paradise city could be a bit overplayed, but I don't mind. The best song on it is Sweet Child of Mine. November Rain was the best song GNR recorded. There's also other great songs on this album that I highlight, Welcome to the Jungle, Mr. Brownstone, and Rocket Queen. This is quite good, buy all the GNR albums with Metallica today. 5 STARS.
0385336810|4.0|My summer reading came to a halt mid July, I was not motivated to read any book...until I came across this.  The plot is very simple:  Emma is an average grad trying her best to move up through the ranks of the corporate world.  Her troubles are like those of many college grads; and they include family, work, love, and a crazy roommate.  She stands apart from the average Jane when her secrets are blurted out to a stranger on a flight in the midst of heavy turbulence.  The stranger soon turns up in her corporate world, and this places her in a horrible situation! <br /> <br />Overally, I found this novel very light-hearted, humorous, and shallow (in a good way).  No deep thinking required, which is perfect for the summer or in-between more thought provoking novels.  I was reminded a lot of \\"Bridget Jones Diary\\" throughout.  If you liked that, then you'll love this novel.
B000002H97|5.0|This is the best cd ever! I enjoy listening to all 3 Metallica albums. This is their best one and has a few of the greatest songs including, Wherever I May Roam, and My Friend of Misery. <br />This is a billion times much better than Green Day's American Idiot. I wish I could give this CD a billion stars, I want to buy this again along with Master of Puppets, and Ride the Lightning. Every rock fan needs this CD, it is almost as good as Dire Straits' On Every Street, Brothers in Arms, and Love Over Gold. Definately much much much better than albums by crappy bands like Pink Floyd, AC/DC, Lynyrd Skynyrd, The Beatles, and Queen, and Led Zeppelin. Get this right now, go out and buy it right now!!
0930289528|4.0|Of all the the comics made into movies recently, only V for Vendetta and Sin City sounded interesting. And V was the only I bothered reading the novel for. It was my first graphic novel and I was in for a surprise. It was one of the best books I had ever read. It was a bit tricky for me to start out with, never having read comics, I had to remember not only who each character was, but what they looked like. After an adjustment period, I quickly fell in love with the style and presentation of V. A great read to browse through or to sit and contemplate. Moore does a great job presenting an a story.
B00006J3T4|5.0|I think that Mark Knopfler is one of our best singers, and guitarists that he ranks the top band along with Dire Straits. <br />All his albums are good...The Ragpicker's Dream is good which includes Coyote. And to Trampled Underfoot, your opinion on great bands is not needed. The bands you love are horrible, and the bands you hate are legends. So leave me alone, please!!! <br />Anyway, you need to get this along with every CD from Foreigner, Nirvana, GNR, Green Day, Metallica, and Mark Knopfler with Dire <br />Straits. Do not pay any attention to the 1 star idiot below me and his stupid recommendations.
0385335482|5.0|I loved, loved, loved this book!  This book has made me laugh out loud and giggle with pure delight.  Sophie Kinsella has demonstrated pure fiction writing perfection with this book.<br /><br />If you have ever had shopping compulsions just for the pure thrill of finding a bargin, you will relate to Rebecca like she is your counterpart.<br /><br />Out of all of Sophie Kinsella's books, this one I must say is one that I would recommend to all as the most enjoyable laugh out loud comedy.
B00004Y6NV|5.0|Dire Straits are my favourite band of all time. They produced several great albums and this one is my favorite of all time. Heavy Fuel does not suck at all, it's one of the greatest songs in history! Brothers in Arms is good but weak!! They should keep <br />going after Brothers in Arms. All the greatest albums of all time <br />were recorded in the 80's and 90's. Metallica are great too, get <br />this with Metallica. Don't read the 1 star reviewers for this great album. Buy it now!!!
B000002HMH|5.0|I honestly don't understand why some Metallica fans despise this album.  Do they seriously expect the band to keep cranking out albums that sound like Kill 'em All (which is their worst in my opinion, worst than St. Anger)?  This album has some of the best songs Metallica has ever written, and the performances are superb.  There is not one bad track on this album.  The songs Ain't My Bitch, Hero of the Day, Bleeding Me, and King Nothing are fantastic, and I even like Mama Said.  It's a very powerful song, and Metallica is very convincing doing it (even though its twin on Reload, Low Man's Lyric, is far superior to it and one of the greatest songs Metallica has ever done).  The closer, The Outlaw Torn, is one of those great Metallica epics, like the title track of Justice, Reload's Fixxxer, Disposable Heroes, The Call of Ktulu, Some Kind of Monster, even The Four Horsemen (the only song I really like all of Kill 'em All).  This album, along with Master of Puppets, are my favorite Metallica albums.  Metallica always had a flair for majestic and epic songs, and this album shows how extraordinary and distinctive they are.  Metallica rules...
B000000W5F|3.0|I'm not a Stones fan...I just like this album and Some Girls. <br />Tattoo you is good and has one of their best songs in Start me up. Get it, but avoid the albums A BIGGER BANG, and OUT OF OUR HEADS albums which suck big time.
B000G1ALRK|5.0|This is the best country album in years.  Go buy it and let it play and play and play!!!
B00004Y6NU|5.0|I will have to say that Dire Straits kicked the 80's great along with Metallica, and Foreigner. Love Over Gold is a terrific album <br />and has the best epic in history, Telegraph Road. 14 fine minutes <br />of that includes great guitar work. Buy this album with Movies, and On Every Street and ignore the haters. PS. DIRE STRAITS ARE THE GREATEST BAND IN HISTORY SO BUY ALL THEIR ALBUMS.
B000002PB2|5.0|This is the album that started off Night Ranger's very long and rocky career, I love all of their CD's but this first one will always hold a special place in my heart. <br />IT ROCKS!!!
B00004ZAV3|1.0|Well folks, the Beatles are one of the most overrated bands of all time. They don't make anything melody, or guitar solos..they <br />are only meant for babies!!! This is a pure lousy compilation with lousy songs like I WANT TO HOLD YOUR HAND. Avoid the reviewer SABBATH BLOODY SABBATH and get Dire Straits insted. They are a billion times better!
B000001FA4|4.0|I have always loved U2 both their new stuff and their old stuff. I bought this CD on a friend's recommendation and I have not regretted it at all. Unforgettable Fire is a stunning song but so are all the others. I would highly recommend this CD to any U2 fan. <br />PS I have lent the CD to the friend who recommended I buy the it in the first place.
B0000E1ALR|4.0|The Boss was one of the greatest hard rockers besides Tom petty. <br />He rocks really hard in tracks including Born in the usa, Glory days, and Human touch. Get this with albums from Dire Straits, Metallica, Nirvana, GNR, Green Day, and Foreigner but avoid awful bands like Boston, The Beatles, Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, and Lynyrd Skynyrd who suck big time.
B000AMJDHY|5.0|I bought this CD on the strength of 1 song \\"I Write Sins not Tragedies\\". It is a decision I haven't regretted yet. <br />Brendan Urie has the most gorgeous chocolate brown eyes and a voice like liquid honey.  <br />I love the theatrical nature of most of the songs, the clever wit and repartee. Brendan certainly has a quick and clever voice. I imagine he could talk his way into and out of anything. <br />The music is very catching and grabs your attention. I have everyone at work listening to the CD as well. <br />Panic at the Disco will be touring New Zeland later on this year. Unfortunately they have proved so popular here that the tickets sold out the first day they went on sale. I can only hope I can manage to win a double pass to go and see them otherwise I will be going to Sydney, Australia to see them instead.
B000002H33|5.0|I can't get enough of this legendary metal band, Metallica.  <br />They are one of my all time favourites and have one of my favorite songs in 'Orion'. Get all 3 Metallica albums in this, Ride the Lightning, and Black Album. <br />
B00004ZAV3|5.0|I WANT TO REMIND THE PREVIOUS REVIEWER THAT MUCH OF THE GREAT MUSIC PRODUCED IN THE SEVENTIES WAS DUE TO THE INFLUENCES THAT THE BEATLES HAD ON OTHER BANDS.THEY WERE THE BEST WHICH IS VERY WELL REFLECTED IN THIS GREAT COLLECTION OF 27 SONGS. <br />THE BEATLES ARE THE GREATEST.
B000002H2H|5.0|Ride the Lightning is easily one of Metallica's best albums.  I still like Master of Puppets better, but this album helped get them known before Master of Puppets was released.<br /><br />This has to be one of Metallica's heaviest albums, it might not be as ambitious as Master of Puppets, or as dark as ...And Justice For All, but it's heavy as hell.<br /><br />This album features some fast paced, electrifying thrash masterpieces, and it also features a couple of slower songs that add to the overall feel of the album.<br /><br />The sound on this album is somewhat reminiscent of Ozzy era Black Sabbath.  In fact, the triplet riff in For Whom the Bell Tolls sounds very much like the triplet outro riff in Black Sabbath's \\"Fairies Wear Boots.\\"<br /><br />Two of the songs on here that are most commonly heard on the radio are For Whom the bell Tolls, and one of my favorites, Fade To Black.  The song Fade To Black is a very stark portrayal of suicide.  It starts off kind of slow, almost soft for this album, but it gets heavy towards the end, and it has some excellent guitar work.<br /><br />Some underrated songs on here are Creeping Death, a concert favorite, and Escape, one of the catchier songs on the album.<br /><br />The closing song, Call of the KTULU, is an awesome closer, and an excellent instrumental.  It's long, but it's one of the best instrumentals I've ever heard on a metal album.<br /><br />Ride the Lightning is a raw powered, fast paced, heavy as hell album.  If you a fan of thrash, you'll love this album.
B000002UAX|5.0|WOW,I CANT IMAGINE ANYONE HATING A BAND AS GREAT AS THE BEATLES.THEY ARE SUPERB,TERRIFIC,BRILLIANT,GREAT AND MARVELOUS.THIS IS ONE OF THEIR BEST ALBUMS AFTER ABBEY ROAD.SO MY FRIENDS I WOULD NOT PAY ANY ATTENTION TO THE ONE STAR REVIEWS,I WOULD GO STRAIGHT TO MY RECORD STORE AND BUY IT.  PS:THE BEATLES ARE AS GOOD AS PINK FLOYD AND LYNYRD SKYNYRD.AVOID ALL ALBUMS FROM OVERRATED GROUPS LIKE GREEN DAY,FOREIGNER AND NIRVANA.
B000F7CMRM|4.0|A stylish, sophisticated, complex film. Really almost too complex. Ultimately director Stephan Gaghan is able to tie all the threads together, but that doesn't make the film comprehensible as it's being viewed. Too many unknown thugs run in and out of warehouses and hotel rooms; too many oil rigs and fields migrate on and off the screen; too many random and unidentified telephones ring; who is answering them? Where are they? What does it all mean? To grasp this movie fully, I would have to watch it again, and I don't want to. <br /> <br />Even so, a pudged-up but nonetheless charismatic and intense George Clooney does a great job, as do most all the actors, and it's a distinguished cast -- Matt Damon, Chris Cooper, Amanda Peet, Jeffrey Wright. Fast-paced and accompanied by a subtle, percussion-heavy score by Alexandre Desplat, the film is easy to watch and exciting as long as you're willing to tolerate some confusion and ambiguity . . . and as long as you don't mind the very heavy-handed anti-American message. <br /> <br />On that topic, it's unclear to me how much truth there is in this movie. It's based on a book (and it seems the author collaborated with the film-makers) called \\"See No Evil: The True Story of a Ground Soldier in the CIA's War on Terrorism,\\" but the country at the center of the film, \\"Syriana,\\" is a fictional composite. Also, the message just comes out too neatly that capitalism is hypocritical and that the American democracy has entirely been hijacked by corrupt forces that care only about getting oil and making money. Maybe that's true, but the details here are quite hard to credit. For example, I find it really hard to fathom that the private lawyer Dean Whiting (a symbolic name if I've ever heard one!), played by Christopher Plummer, could really wield such control over the inner reaches of the CIA. The film finally stretches belief in a way that causes one to think it is a bit of propaganda.
B00008BXJG|5.0|I CANT THINK OF A BETTER HARD ROCK ALBUM THAN HIGHWAY TO HELL.I WILL RUN OUT OF SUPERLATIVES IN PRASING THIS WHICH IS AS GOOD AS LED ZEPPELIN'S FOURTH ALBUM.I LIKE ALL THEIR ALBUMS TILL STIFF UPPER LIP SO I RECOMMEND THIS VERY HIGHLY.
0201485672|4.0|a good and clear book for improving your code in small steps. a lot of (not language specific) good examples.
B0000TLA9G|1.0|HEY LOOK KIDS,GUNS N ROSES ARE JUNK JUST LIKE GREEN DAY.THEY HAVE PRODUCED ONLY A FEW NOTEWORTHY SONGS LIKE ESTRANGED AND NOVEMBER RAIN.REST OF THEIR STUFF IS BELOW MEDIOCRE.DONT BUY THIS CD WHEN THERE ARE BETTER ALBUMS LIKE A BIGGER BANG FROM THE ROLLING STONES THERE.GET THE STONES CD INSTEAD.
B00029QWII|5.0|\\"Passion of the Christ\\" is just simply one of the most important films made in the history of film. Jim Caviezel has becom \\"THE\\" cinematic Christ, from now on any actor portraying Jesus will have to study and build upon Caviezel's portrayal. <br />Mel Gibson really put his heart and soul into this film and it's a wonderful and beautiful and forceful film.  <br />I love you Mel! <br />
B0002OERI0|1.0|WOW,I CANT IMAGINE ANYONE PRAISING THIS AWFUL ALBUM.EACH AND EVERY SONG IS A TURD AND I WAS SURPRISED THAT THEY WON A GRAMMY WHEN THEY ARE MORE DESERVING BANDS LIKE THE ROLLING STONES STILL OUT THERE.AVOID THIS AND GET STICKY FINGERS FROM THE ROLLING STONES INSTEAD.  PS:GREEN DAY ARE AS BAD AS FOREIGNER AND NIRVANA.AVOID THEIR ALBUMS AND IGNORE METALLICA ROCKS REALLY HARD.
6305837325|5.0|I love this DVD! The ocean photography is absolutely gorgeous... and the music and natural sounds are so soothing and beautiful. This DVD has two separate soundtracks - one with music and natural sounds... and the other with NATURAL SOUNDS OF THE OCEAN ONLY!(The other reviewer might need to learn how to use his DVD player...it even says so right on the box!) Personally I prefer the beautiful acoustic guitar and piano music mixed with the natural sounds the best. But sometimes, I just play the DVD with the sounds of the ocean only. It's very relaxing that way. I found the vivid color, excellent quality, and gentle slow motion to really add to the overall sensual impression of the Pacific Ocean that this wonderful DVD evokes. The quality of my DVD was superb. ONE OF MY ALL TIME FAVORITES!
B00005K3NY|5.0|Scanners marks the emergence of David Cronenberg from low-budget horror auteur to one of the most unique voices in filmmaking of the last thirty or so years. He first came onto the scene directing such low-budget horror films such as Shivers, Rabid and The Brood. These three films were later said to have had that Cronenberg propensity to show the horror of the body-politic at its most basic. Cronenberg pretty much points out of how true horror might not be lurking on the outside, but within the the human body. Cronenberg makes the human body as forever changing and mutating against the individual person's wants and desire of what was suppose to be the ideal. The horror that we as a people do not and will never have control over our own body was where the true horror lie.<br /><br />In 1981, Cronenberg moves from the purely physical horror to one where the technology man was forever trying to create and achieve perfection would turn on the biological aspect of the human condition. This new form of techno-organic mutation was as terrifying as it was seductive in its potential to those afflicted with it. Cronenberg begins this phase in his filmmaking voice with his excellent, underappreciated and cult-classic Scanners.<br /><br />The premise for Scanners had alot in common with Stephen King's novel Firestarter in the fact that in dealt with an omnipresent and powerful organization: the CIA's shadowy branch that dealt with experimental weapons programs for Firestarter and the ultra-powerful CONSEC multinational corporation in Scanners. These two organizations experiment on random select individuals using experimental drug treatments under the guise of helpful medications. What results from these experiments are more than what was truly expected by their handlers. In Scanners the result comes from mental abilities never seen or documented in the past. CONSEC's experiments have yielded a unique group of individuals, 237 of them, to manifest powers of the mind that make them living weapons of mass destruction. Instead of becoming a new wonder-weapon for CONSEC to sell to their government contacts, these 237 become unstable in personality, some going as far as to develop a God-complex. Others are driven insane by these new abilities and retreat away from the rest of humanity in order to achieve a semblance of mental peace.<br /><br />These two different reactions from the 237 are keenly represented by two of the main character's in Cronenberg's film. There's Cameron Vale (played by Stephen Lack who had an eerie resemblance to the same named character of Stephen in Dawn of the Dead) who we first see as a vagrant who seems to be suffering from some sort of mental problem. This is farther from the truth as Dr. Paul Ruth (father of the CONSEC drug effemerol that causes the mutation and played with eccentric flair by Patrick McGoohan) soon discover that Vale's mental problems is due to him possessing preternatural mental abilities of the highest order. Ruth's guilt over what his experiments have done and created leads him to use Vale to counter the growing underground of those 237 who have seen their newfound abilities as a stepping stone to supplanting the normal status quo with their own in a plan of global domination that would make fans of X-Men very proud.<br /><br />Leader of this underground groups of scanners (as the 237 were called) is one Darryl Revok. A scanner whose abilities rival those of Vale's but whose mental instability for wanting to dominate the normals of the world makes him the most dangerous individual on the face of the planet. Genre veteran Michael Ironside steals the film from everyone else. His grand and classic introduction early in the film has gone down in filmmaking history as one of the most shocking scenes put on film. Ironside's performance as the scanner with the God-complex was truly megalomaniacal and it was easy to root against him, but hard to take one's eyes from the screen when he was on. Revok truly made for one of film history's classic villains.<br /><br />In the middle of Vale and Revok's war for control lies Kim Obrist (played by the beautiful Jennifer O'Neill) who tries to lead those who just want to be left alone from being used by both Revok and CONSEC. O'Neill's performance was the most grounded in reality, as much as a film about people with mental powers could be, and tries to keep the film from getting too fantastic.<br /><br />This I think was what made Scanners such a great film. As ludicrous a premise as the film had to base its sotry on, there was always a sense of realism to keep everything form becoming too much like a comic book. The story paints a story that could happen in reality since similar things have occurred in the past such as the LSD testing on US military personnel during the 50's and 60's. Cronenberg plays on such fears of outside factors introduced by scientists looking to forever improve on what nature took eons to evolve. It's this hubris about man's attempt to dominate his own body which interests Cronenberg and what would happen if he did succeed in doing something nature and humanity wasn't ready for.<br /><br />Scanners marked Cronenberg's interest in examining the effect of man's quest for better and better technology, whether mechanical or biological, on humanity's physical and mental existence. What he brongs forth, first with Scanners then later on with Videodrome and The Fly, was something both horrific and seductive. Who wouldn't want to have such abilities as Vale and Revok had at their command. But by the end of Scanners the film posits the question of how much of one's humanity must be sacrificed for such huge leaps on the evolutionary ladder. Will the resulting amalgamation of nature and technology still leave something human or just something that pretends to look like one.<br /><br />Some have called Scanners a horror movie and some have called it a sci-fi thriller. It's both those and more. It's really hard to pin down just exactly which genre Scanners falls under since Cronenberg never tried to stay within one particular one. The film works as a thriller, as a science-fiction story, a horror flick and a philosophical exercise in examining the human condition. Cronenberg's skill was clearly evident in keeping all these differing themes and genres from becoming out-of-place and bringing the finished product from becoming too flawed. Cronenberg's first foray into this new phase of his filmmaking career ushered in what some have called Cronenberg at his most daring and pure. I wouldn't argue with such an argument. Scanners is a film of great quality that would forever be used as an example of Cronenberg's genius as a filmmaker.y's classic villains.

B000EQ4G5K|3.0|i bought a cd that was said to be new, and great condition, though the cd, was scratched from tracks 11-13, where one of the songs was my favorite.
0783240236|4.0|Fair price for an excellent DVD Movie.  Shipping and Delivery was excellent.
0553802534|1.0|This was quite possibly the most disgusting book I've ever read. <br /> <br />None of the characters were likeable.  I couldn't really root for any of them except maybe Nathan.  Bobby was an idiot, Catherine was too messed up for words and caused her son to be equally messed up, and the grandparents (!). <br /> <br />I picked this book up because I like the Survivor's Club.  That wasn't exactly a children's book but this one was far too dark to be enjoyable.  I finished it not so much to find out what happened as to just get the whole experience over and done.  It's the first book I've ever read that made me want to take a shower after finishing it.   <br /> <br />That having been said, I still have hopes for some of Gardner's other works.
B00006CXXU|4.0|Yes, I like Christina Aguilera. There.<br /><br />Stripped covers a lot of ground in its 20-track span. There's some hip hop flavored tracks, a rock influenced song, a few R & B songs, and of course, some ballads. Variety like that doesn't come around very often in the pop genre, so kudos goes to Christina for that. While Stripped isn't perfect, it is one of the best pop records offered in quite a while.<br /><br />This is where the harsh criticism comes into play. I personally think Christina has a tremendous voice, she just overdoes it sometimes. And it doesn't surprise me one bit that some people despise it. I also think Christina makes quality pop music. Lets look at her pop peers. Britney? Come on, she hasn't made anything 'new' since the debut, all she does is rehash and recycle. Jessica? Don't get me started on her. Really one of the few well known pop artists (I use that term loosely) that even compares is Shakira. Both have strong voices, both make good music, both use their sexuality to their advantage.<br /><br />Stripped was a long time coming. I feel it took way longer than it should've to put this out, but hey, job well done, and I'm not arguing about the loss of her clothes either. The music is uncomparably stronger this time around. The debut was decent for when it came out but didn't hold up for long. I won't talk about the other projects in between. On Stripped however, her vocals are the driving force behind every song, and the lyrics are definitely better (thank you Linda Perry). With half of the songs being in the upper teir of pop music and the others being nice additions, Stripped begs your attention throughout the duration. The emotion in the songs honestly feels real and the delivery is spot on about 93% of the time.<br /><br />Special mention goes to I'm OK. Through and through one of the best and most emotional pop songs I've heard in years. Something I thought I'd never say about Christina Aguilera.<br /><br />My favorite songs are Fighter, Cruz, Soar, The Voice Within, and I'm OK. I figure whether or not you like the image Christina came out with on this CD, if you only listen to the music, you can't help but enjoy at least a few of the songs. So if you like pop and haven't picked up Stripped yet, something must be wrong with you, everything is here that makes a CD memorable.are Fighter, Cruz, Soar, The Voice Within, and I'm OK.

B000ANVPPQ|5.0|Finally a great DVD of this great movie!! The colour and the whole presentation is what is should be.
B00004Y6NU|4.0|Triple H: Love Over Gold was a good album but not the best Dire Straits album. Shawn Michaels: They are good but not as great as Rush or Slayer! Triple H: The best song on this album is not Telegraph Road, whough it is cool, but It Never Rains! Shawn Michaels: I personally like Industrial Disease, Private Investigations and the title track. Triple H: Love Over Gold was good but not as great as Iron Maiden's Number of the Beast album. Shawn Michaels: Or Rush's Signals album. If you are not down with DX, WE GOT TWO WORDS FOR YA(crowd yells \\"S*CK IT!\\")

B00005JOYM|1.0|Oliver Stone has always been a good translator of physical pain, the stages of dying and death to the big screen.  Ever since Midnight Express to Platoon to Born on the Fourth of July he has had the gifts to express to us what it's like to be beaten in a Turkish prison or the brutality of Viet Nam or what it's like to be confined to a wheel chair.<br /><br />So, in his latest effort it's only fitting that he shows us, and makes us feel what it's like to be trapped many yards below at ground zero in the aftermath of one of the worst tragedies in American history.  Stone succeeds at this as we feel the main characters physical pain and brutal injuries, but loses us when he continually goes for the tugging of the heart strings in the domestic scenes with the wives, in-laws, and kids.<br /><br />These scenes have to be some of the most clumsily filmed scenes of Stone's career.  They have no dramatic arc to them and they destroy all the nice continuity of entrapment and claustrophobia our victims experience. Furthermore, they are way over the top.  It's too much manipulation and after a while you will not be able to stand all the nagging melodramatic music. The movie tries too hard to be a crowd pleaser and a \\"no dry eye in the house\\" movie.<br /><br />I liked the flashback scenes of the family lives before 9/11 and they fit well into the movie.  They are good because we can sense the thoughts of what our main protagonists are thinking about.<br /><br />Does the movie succeed?  I don't think so.  Stone has always been a visceral director and that's good, but here there's something missing from all of his other work.  There's no sense of rhythm or flow to this.  It's one montage working against the other (domestic house scenes with wife and kids vs. the victims trapped at ground zero).<br /><br />One other irritating bit...and it's been a problem with Stone's last few films where he tries to slip in symbolism and gets laughter.  For example, what in the world was the symbolism of Christ serving Aquafina to the victim?  And how about Nicolas Cage talking to his wife at the end.  Folks, people were laughing at this bizarre stuff in the theater.  I don't think that was Stone's intention.<br /><br />World Trade Center has some brilliant moments and some really bad moments that take us out of the MOMENT.  It feels like a rough cut of a movie that hasn't been finely tuned or cut right.ld was the symbolism of Christ serving Aquafina to the victim?

0066620996|5.0|I received item in a timely manner and I am very happy with the item.
B000A7Q2DM|5.0|i would have never gotten familiar with 30s2m if they didn't cover björk's fascinating-horrifying song HUNTER. being a huge admirer of Björk's Homogenic-Vespertine-Medúlla era i was quite shocked because i believe that it's almost a blasphemy to do anything with her songs, as they are perfect and impossible to be outdone, and she is the most talented musician ever and does anything better than anyone else anyway. the other shocking information was when i got to know that this band is actually fronted by actor Jared Leto, best known as Harry Goldfarb from Requiem 4 a dream, Angel Face from Fincher's fantastic Fight Club or Jr. from Fincher's disappointing Panic Room. i really loved that guy in these movies, his funny caracter was the only reason i eventually enjoyed Panic Room for example, so i went \\"god! what's he doin'? is he gonna be the male Jennifer Lopez?\\" now, i am glad to admit that my doubts and fears about both the Björk cover and his music-talent proved to be wrong.    i downloaded the untitled debut album and Beautiful lie as well, and i wanted to see where they improve (if) so i listened to the debut first. it was not an overwhelming experience, i will have to admit, it was not bad, but it was far from being called good, it was just decent. there are numerous factors that make their debut easy to be forgotten. they intended to make an experimental heavily concept-oriented album, with a unique sound. i appreciate this intention, however, that is very hard to do, when you want to do something that is meant to be one of a kind, you have to improve your material to perfection. hence Björk's 3 albums mentioned above. the 2 Letos and their then-bandmates didn't manage to do this. they spent all their energies to create their image, which was not very original to begin with. less effort were taken about the music itself. Jared Leto's voice wasn't good enough, either, it was obvious that he had the talent, but also that he didn't use his abilities fully. imissed the real melodies, the real tone instead of screaming, the structures, verses and refrains, and some good memorable vocal lines. all these problems resulted in a shallow and immature debut CD which was very mediocrate IMHO.    guess 30s2m was aware of these matters as well, as 3 yrs later they come out with something different, something much better. all that made debut LP not so good were left behind, and all that was missing now was there. i was really satisfied with that stuff (i bought it immediately in original, of course), i actually listened to it over and over again for weeks which is very unusual when it comes to me, last time it was placebo's sleeping with ghosts that manage to catch that much. why do i love it so much? first of all they dropped their psuedo-experimental style and started something much friendlier, mature and melodic. (for recent reviewers: just because something is radio-capable it doesn't mean that it is a junk, and vica versa non-radio music is not necesserily high-quality) Jared's voice got incredibly better, i almost couldn't believe i am listening to the same guy, he is very emotional, still he screams too much unfortunately and sometimes he sounds he is a little too breathy, but he got real great moments almost in every song. the music is very exciting and enjoyable i really can't say anything wrong about it. however, i also admit that almost every song are remiscent to some other artists, but now i don't mean rock bands of nowadays, but great 90s bands which are not a shame to be inspired by. althogh it's not my style i must write something about each song...    ATTACK is a pretty standard anthemic modern rock song, it's an obvious choice to be the lead single. he shouldn't scream that much  title track A BEAUTIFUL LIE is the first \\"i've heard it somewhere before\\" experience. this time it's remiscent to Placebo's title track of Sleeping with Ghosts (if you heard the live up-beated version of that song titled Soulmates you know what i mean), with its quiet piano-sample and bluesy-atmospheric sound. however nothing will ever sound as good as placebo. i like it though  second single THE KILL is somehow my least favourite track on the CD again mostly because the annoying screaming in the refrains, but the verses and the outro is good  WAS IT A DREAM? is the first \\"i love this song\\" on the CD, and yes, it's very very very Cure-like, i mean it's completely Cure. even the raindrops are stolen from Cure's 1989 tearjerker The same deep water as you. now, i have been a fan of Cure's ever since their album Disintegration, but after their album Bloodflowers i just lost interest in their music, and robert smith's voice begun to annoy me, so i am happy with this borrowing, as it's cool to hear that early 90s Cure-sound again. Leto doesn't scream this time, and watch out... the song is perfect. i love it  THE FANTASY is... simply great, in this song even the screaming is in place the middle of the song is very well-structured it's surprising, i relly enjoy this one  SAVIOUR is a masterpiece again, it's probably my favourite pick, the vocals are well-built and beautiful-sung, the refrain is out of this world, and the sond has a chilling-cold industrial-electronic sound which i am very keen on  FROM YESTERDAY sets off very U2-like, U2 was also one of my love affairs in the 90s, but similar to Cure they lost me after All that you can't leave behind. again the melody keeps resonating in your ears, the refrain makes you wanna fly, it's great again  now come the ballads, STORY is again very Cure-sounding, Leto doesn't scream, so it's beautiful, depressing, i love it  in the verses of R-EVOLVE Jared sound much like daniel jones of silverchair (used to love them as well), no screaming, great song, kind of an ars poetica  MODERN MYTH is my other favourite track, Leto's vocals, the way she sings \\"the secret is out\\" and says \\"goodbye\\" for like 20 times in the end, it's a real tearjerker, it's beautiful, after like 10 minutes of silence you will hear a 1 min long hidden track that is nothing special.  there are 2 bonus tracks also included, BATTLE OF ONE is a simple and powerful one and the other one is that cover........    now, i am really surprised to say that i am absolutely satisfied with their treatment of such a perfect but fragile song. this one is actually very similar to the original they kept the powerful beats and thrilling strings of the original, an the other hand they dared to rewrite some lines like replacing \\"scandinavian\\" with \\"american\\" or \\"this is soon\\", it works well, and that's a big deal, because a biased Björk-fan says this. but please! why always writing bjork instead of björk, it' a shame. it's BJÖRK (ÖÖÖÖÖÖÖÖÖÖÖ)    now i have to finish this review as it is already damned too long, the conclusion is that the second installment of 30s2m is way better than their debut    god bless everyone
B00000DG1R|3.0|Had all the favorites I love and remember, but was very dissappointed by the shortened versions of \\"Save A Prayer\\" and \\"Hungry Like the Wolf\\".  Yes, us true Durannies know the difference!
B000G75AE8|4.0|That's right, I said MASTERS, because I beleive that Slayer invented THRASH/DEATH METAL.  Although some claim that Venom did, I would have to dissagree.  This album brings the original members back for the attack and also dips back to the mid 80's/early 90's awesome Slayer sound.  Hell, just by reading the old style, devil-worship lyrics you think that if GOD sees you that you will be struck by lightning! Of course nowadays there are darker, louder, metal bands-but will they stand the test of time like Slayer? I highly doubt it.  This album is only about 38 minutes long but you will not be disappointed.  Just think of it as a quicker way to start back at the beginning and blow your eardrums out all over again! Rock on and keep true metal alive-Just buy it!
B000AMJG4Y|4.0|Has some awesome fight scenes, and a good story.  Has the sense of humor you expect from Final Fantasy, and great imagination.
B000AMJDHY|1.0|This band really sucks, after hearing fall out boy i was like man can music get any worse, then panic came out and now i just dont know what to do. if i could give this negative stars i would, what has happened to the good music, like the smashing pumpkins, nirvana, pearl jam, led zeppelin, weezer, pink floyd, rush, the list goes on. This is a really bad album, i listened to it once and  i sold it right away, so dont make the same mistake i did and go buy it, listen to real music. i know i sound harsh to all you panic fans out there but seriously, come on!!! panic at the disco, what is that??
B000A88F22|1.0|Those were the days when Britney and K-Fed were madly in love, too bad it didn't last but hey these people need professional help. I am glad America didn't buy into the hype, this is a nice little memory of how dumb Britney could be, how sweet right?
B000G75AE8|5.0|Fantastic album ! <br />How any band can come out with stuff like this, after being a band of nearly 25 years is amazing ! <br />They have now left everyone in this catagory of music dead and truly buried. <br />How anyone does'nt give this a five star has'nt played it enough times ! <br />Good to see Dave back on drums,no match anywhere against this bloke! <br />Thats speaks for all band members, TRULY GODS !!!
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|i waited so long to get this movie, it wasn't disappointing. Except for the fact that the game lasted many sleeples night and days of playing and the movie lasted one evening. Also for those who are wondering, yes it's in english.
0061091480|5.0|One of the most impressive message that I could've learnt from the author is that generosity toward other were not merely \\"Right\\" ethical expectation. It was some sort of conventional thought which oppresses sound willingness to have a happy life of an each individual. Thus, this book provided me spiritual emancipation to get free from many undsirable stereotypes. I highly recommend this book to person who just preoccupied with \\"Only for future\\". It will inculcate you that we have great privilige that is \\"Present\\". This book will be great way to edify my personality throughout my life.
B000G75AE8|3.0|First off... yeah, this isn't Seasons in the Abyss or South of Heaven, it's not even Divine Intervention... but its not bad.  Slayer is different, these guys are in their 40's i think, or damn close. In short:  They are old.  Tom's voice is different, and Kerry and Jeff have done it all already.  They are just trying to put out heavy, violent, and angry music.  And in that they have succeeded.  You would have to be a moron to pick up a new Slayer album and expect Seasons in the Abyss or Reign in Blood (I mean, where the hell were you for Diabolus in Musica and God Hates us All... hello!  That's the direction they are going now).  Gone are the scary melodies from their erlier albums (like Dead Skin Mask and South of Heaven) because that doesn't sell as big as the metal-core sounding riffs and screams.  At least they didn't pull a Metallica and gay down their music.
B000002G23|5.0|This is my favorite box set ever since I bought it when it first came out in 1993.  It contains all 5 police albums, with only one disc (regatta de blanc) interrupted between sides one and two.  Once its on your ipod, its complete again.  But here the B-sides are truly great original songs that stand on their own and help to complete the picture.  Songs like Shambelle, Dead End Job and Once upon a daydream reflect the albums they were left off of and are very very good.  Interesting to read in the liner notes that Sting wrote 97% of the music and lyrics.  Booklet is more than a scrapbook, but rather an extensive and informative history of the band.
1571200851|2.0|I love this book to look at.  The flowers are beautiful, and the projects are as well.  However, the instructions and illustrations are poor.  Some of them are photographs using dark fabric, so you cannot see what the directions are describing.  I found it impossible to figure out several of the folded projects.  I have done origami and all sorts of other craft, quilting, and sewing projects, so am not a novice to following directions.  This book has been a disappointment because I can't figure out how to make all the things I see in it.
B000000XB9|5.0|CCR may not have been as innovative or infulential as their peers (Led Zeppelin, The Beatles), but man they knew how to create fast paced, energetic, no holds barred rock and roll.<br /><br />The 1994 compilation \\"Chronicle\\" is one of the rare greatest hits compilations that can hold its own in the artists' catalogue against the original studio albums. Every major hit single CCR ever had is included on this compilation, including \\"Green River\\", \\"Proud Mary\\", \\"Down On The Corner\\", \\"Lookin' Out My Back Door\\" and \\"Have You Ever Seen The Rain\\". The sound quality is very good (not out and out fantastic, but nothing to really complain about), and the liner notes while brief make for a good read.<br /><br />Overall, this is definitely a cd I would recommend you add to your collection.
B000E41MS6|5.0|I loved watching the older Doctor Who series as a kid SO much that even when the picture was not great on our TV because we live out in the boonies where we had no cable, I'd sit through the aggrevation of static just to watch Tom Baker and Peter Davidson.  This new series game me that enjoyment again, without the static, with a well played Doctor and a great supporting cast.   <br /> <br />Christopher Eccleston nails the Doctor perfectly. All of the characters are wonderfully complete, full of humor and seriousness that makes them real to us and set in stories that tickle a Sci-Fi Fan's imagination.  Russell T. Davies had done a fabulous job in regenerating the Doctor and I look forward to more.
B00005KHJM|4.0|The story involves a police officer (Edward Woodward) flying to a Scottish isle to find a missing girl. As a devout Christian he is horrified to learn that the islanders have long ago rejected Christianity in favor of paganism. He starts to suspect that the entire populace is involved with the girl's disappearance.<br /><br />Many people peg \\"The Wicker Man\\" as a horror film, but this is not correct. Yes, it ends as a horror story but the first 85% of the film is a mix of other film genres -- mystery/dectective, musical and erotica.<br /><br />The cast features Christopher Lee as the head pagan Lord Summerisle. Britt Ekland and Ingrid Pitt are also on hand.<br /><br />WHAT WORKS: The picture was filmed on location in Scotland and features some truly breath-taking photography. It'll definitely make you want to visit this magnificent region of the earth.<br /><br />Britt Ekland plays \\"Willow,\\" the hotelkeeper's daughter, and she has an excellent scene trying to lure Woodward out of his room for some late-night amorous activity. Her siren-song \\"How Do\\" is a soothing and moving piece of music. Sometimes I just put on this scene to enjoy (I'm talking musically, of course, but Ekland is pleasing to look at as well). The film is worth getting just for this song.<br /><br />The May-pole song is also a catchy folk ditty.<br /><br />[SPOILER ALERT!]<br /><br />The ending is also a bit unexpected. I kept waiting for Woodward to escape his terrible predicament, but it never happened -- they literally fried his a$$!<br /><br />[END SPOILER ALERT]<br /><br />WHAT DOESN'T WORK: As the mystery progresses and Woodward does his detective work the story fails to capture your undivided attention. In other words, the story has a decidedly lazy vibe to it; your mind may wander at times. Needless to say, if you have a problem with ACDC -- I'm sorry, I mean ADHD -- you probably won't like this picture.<br /><br />THINGS TO KEEP IN MIND: This is an early 70s British film and so naturally has that Hammer film vibe, even though it's not a Hammer film. The folk songs and soundtrack naturally reflect this era. So, if you don't like Hammer films or early 70s folk/hippy music you probably won't appreciate \\"The Wicker Man.\\"<br /><br />Also, there is a lot of nudity, even in the short version, so if nudity offends you skip this one.<br /><br />FINAL ANALYSIS: This is a very original film that successfully mixes various film genres. As far as originality goes \\"The Wicker Man\\" is 5-Stars film all the way. It's worthy of its 'cult film' status. It's dated, however, and therefore screams out for a remake. Hence, although nothing can ever take the place of the original, I'm personally looking forward to the remake.<br /><br />FINAL COMMENT: Did the mainland police officer REALLY lose in this story? Philippians 1:21 states, \\"to live is Christ and to die is gain.\\"nd soundtrack naturally reflect this era.

B00005JKG7|4.0|John Carpenter's \\"The Fog\\" (1980) involves the horrific ghosts of a ship of lepers returning to enact revenge on a Northern California community 100 years after the founders of the village did them wrong.<br /><br />The first time I saw this film I found it kind of boring. Since then, however, I've come to see its numerous positives:<br /><br />- The film has MOOD. Carpenter successfully captured a nice spooky ambiance for his ghost story. The haunting atmosphere is nicely captured in the opening scene where John Houseman shares the ghost tale to a group of kids at a campfire on the coast.<br /><br />- Spectacular locations. The picture was filmed in the beautiful Point Reyers/Bodega Bay region North of San Francisco.<br /><br />- Fabulous Score. Especially the main piano piece that runs during the end credits (a variation of this piece appears only once in the proper film -- when the boy finds the artifact from the Elizabeth Dane). This musical piece actually blows away the more popular main score to Capenter's \\"Halloween\\" and should have been used a couple of more times in the film.<br /><br />- Good Cast, which includes Adrienne Barbeau, Jamie Lee Curtis, Hal Holbrook, Nancy Kyes and Janet Leigh.<br /><br />- An unpredictable finish. I know this is a horror flick and people are supposed to die, but it's nice to see people NOT die for a change. It's refreshing!<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: If you're looking for a fast-paced slasher gorefest, you will not like this film. If, however, you're in the mood for something ghostly atmospheric and aesthetically pleasing, \\"The Fog\\" will likely trip your trigger.<br /><br />PS: Be sure to catch the 2005 remake for a well-done updating of the film (don't listen to the whiners as it's a solid re-imagining).<br /><br />The film runs 90 minutes.<br /><br />GRADE: B
0446577383|1.0|I read this book to the bitter, ridiculous end, but it was an excersise in discipline, patience and self-flagellation.  I wanted to like it, but it was so un-engaging that I couldn't force myself to read more than about 25 pages at a time.  Consequently, it took me about two weeks to make my way through this quagmire.  That said, Bush-hating, blame-America-first Kosputin liberals will love it.  One man's terrorist is another man's noble freedom fighter, you know.    This was my first and last Baldacci book.  I just can't believe that the author of this tripe could write anything worth my time.  Try Vince Flynn, Joel Rosenberg or Oliver North.

B0001ZX0OW|5.0|With a superb plot about the interrelated lives of three childhood friends, this movie has the emotional depth of classic Greek drama. The plot combines story lines over 25 years, of kidnapping and child abuse, armed robberies, betrayal, revenge, jealousy and murder in a completely convincing and thoroughly constructed script. I have watched it three times and am fully convinced that there are absolutely no holes in the story. Every single aspect of it is thought through and in line with the whole.<br />Yes, there is violence in the story, but does that make the movie a violent \\"show\\", as one review claims? Definitely not, much of the violence happens off screen or is not shown in a full and direct way. There is no violence peeping, no gloating in sordid details. Violence here is funtional and not overdone.<br />The actors are top notch, Sean Penn and Tim Robbins fully deserved their acting Oscars. The rest of the cast is on the same level, mainly Kevin Bacon, Lawrence Fishburn, Marcia Gay Harden, Laura Lynney. The directing is superb, Clint E. would have deserved a directing Oscar.<br />The movie, in my view, tells the story better than Dennis Lehane's novel. Apologies to the author, whom I respect a lot for his Boston crime fiction.
B000002AGB|5.0|When i first heard this cd i was shocked on how good the recording sounds. It really captures the band way back in 1970.I dont write many reviews but this is one of those cds that gets better and better even after that first listen and I can remember just thinking wow we are lucky to have this recording. Pete townshend guitar sound is amazing.This is one of those cds that brings you right to the front row. Thats the best way to describe it!I wish more bands had great recordings like this. And its a double cd!! i never realized how great the who was in 1970.
0393327655|5.0|Of the 3000 or so books I have read in the past decade, 750 or so them reviewed here at Amazon (almost all non-fiction) this is perhaps the single most important work that declares, and then documents, the \\"naked Emperor\\" of religion.<br /><br />While I agree with the reviewer that sums it up as saying that religion in the form of blind faith does more harm than good, I would hasten to add that faith is an essential part of the American value system, and can do a great deal of good when channeled in partnership with a tolerant secular state.  See my reviews of \\"The Left Hand of God,\\" \\"Faith-Based Diplomacy,\\" and \\"American Gospel.\\"<br /><br />The alternative sub-title of this book could be \\"The Cost of Intolerance.\\"  However--and I strongly recommend this book to the Information Operations and Public Diplomacy or Strategic Communication professionals--the author is brilliantly on point when he suggests that the third world war now happening is about beliefs--about good beliefs versus bad beliefs, about a need for a morality order of battle.  As Robert Garigue sums up in his own original work offered as a technical preface to my book on Information Operations, war has moved to the semantic level, and we have to focus on identifying, containing, and then eradicating belief systems that are totally set against our once-balanced (not now) combination of secular state and diversity of belief.<br /><br />It merits comment, as discussed in Howard Bloom's \\"Global Brain,\\" that belief systems, once embedded in a person older than 30, are not changeable.  World War III is a war for the minds of those in elementary and secondary school.  We have to contain or kill the adults who believe that martyrdom awaits those who kill \\"unbelievers.\\"  On a positive note, the disciplines of psychology and neuroscience are now coming together (see my review of \\"Psychiatry, Psychoanalysis, and the New Biology of the Mind\\" by Eric Kandel).  At the same time, the discipline of Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) is finally about to be funded properly, and we are within arms reach of being able to make sense of all information in all languages all the time.<br /><br />Over-all the author agrees with those who say we are engaged in a clash of ideologies rather than civilizations.  He notes that democracy can NOT be seen as a precursor to changing beliefs, for as we have found in Iraq, given a vote, most rabid Muslims would vote to give up their public liberties in favor of their blind and intolerant faith.<br /><br />The author is compelling in also noting that poverty, among other high-level threats, is not the source of the conflicts that should frighten us with the prospect of being wiped out.  It is about belief systems.  He suggests that energy independence is actually a pre-requisite to gaining the economic leverage we need, while depriving the radical Muslim states of oil revenues they have consistently used to finance Al Qaeda and Hezbollah, among others.<br /><br />Among the varied insights offered by the author I especially appreciated these:<br /><br />1)  Discussion of how evangelical Christians are penetrating the federal and state governments and subverting secular policy to fight \\"reasoned policy\\" and channel tax-payer funds to specific evangelical missions and churches.<br /><br />2)  A fascinating review of our skewed priorities, where we spend $4 billion annually to eradicate marijuana, which kills no one, while refusing to spend $2 billion one time to secure our ports, meanwhile ignoring the fact that alcohol kills hundreds of thousands.<br /><br />3)  Priceless quote, on page 165: \\"And yet, religious faith obscures uncertainty where uncertainty manifestly exists, allowing the unknown, the implausible, and the patently false to achieve primacy over facts.\\"<br /><br />4)  The author provides a very comprehensive review of both the Koran and the Bible, citing many specific passages, and concludes that even \\"moderate\\" Muslims are inherently trained to believe that \\"unbelievers\\" are to be converted or killed.  This is, incidentally, the first stage of genocide, where the one to be killed is put into a class with vermin to set the stage for acceptable massacres.<br /><br />The book concludes with a brilliant and provocative call for a science of good and evil, an ethics and science of the mind.  The author states that truth is NOT just a matter of consensus or belief, and that some truths, in a human or reality sense, must be absolute.  He calls for common sense and a sensibility of tolerance for others, while stating quite clearly that we must identify and kill those who threaten us \\"blindly.\\"  He concludes that both torture and pacifism are wrong, and that principled moral engagement, one for all and all for one, is what is right.  He supports non-violence where it works, but force is still needed for the greater evils that will respond to no other means.<br /><br />The author documents the origin of the yellow star to \\"mark\\" Jews as having been in Baghdad, and only much later adopted by the Nazis.<br /><br />The paperback version has a Question & Answer section that is not in the hardback original.<br /><br />This is an extraordinary book, and should be--but of course is not--influencing those who would lead their Nation into a future of peace and prosperity.

B000058983|2.0|This album is not bad but it is no masterpiece. The songs sound old, very garage-rock. Some of it is unlistenable. Its pretty tough to listen to the whole thing at once.<br /><br />\\"Alone again or\\" however is an incredible and unique song. UFO does a cool version of this song.

1582432678|2.0|Overly long (who edited it?), pretenious (Eva's language/voice was more akin to that of a university english professor than that of a writer of budget travel guides), contrived, unrealistic and under-developed plot all led to me being very disappointed with this book which I am surprised won the Orange Prize for Fiction. <br /> <br />The detailed descriptions of similar massacres were pointless and in my view sensationalist.  The whole premise of the book was that Kevin was born evil and yet at no point in time did the book delve into an exploration or explanation of Kevin's psychiatric profile - which might have added more value and insight into the issue of school massacres. <br /> <br />Eve was unlikeable and her cynicism and superior rants were hard to take.  I struggled through to the end which was weak indeed.

B00005JOQS|1.0|SUPERMAN REPEATS<br /><br />Scene stealing is the highlight of this lackluster blockbuster.<br /><br />I mean literally lines lifted from the original don't make it as good, but make it cheating, and like they can't think of ORIGINAL scenes or WIT.<br /><br />  It makes you wonder are they doing a remake? Or a recape? And a reboot - with that new costume. Or a rape? But even worse, Big Bird's half a remake. And every stolen take is half-baked. The copycakes.<br /><br />  It got embaressing when they start to duplicate a scene, and you think well at least they don't do that completely - and then they do later, like with the music.<br /><br />  Oh yeh, and the music not by John Williams stands out like a - another person! It falls flat like Supe without his powers. Why didn't they at least get him? Who shot JW? And then when William's music comes in again it sticks out like a soar-ing man!<br /><br />It makes me sore they can't find an original script writer.<br /><br />  At a million a minute, it amazed me what they film.<br /><br />  Doing a sequal 25 years later is bad enough and doesn't work, but make it half the same makes less sense!<br /><br />  25 years later the new Bluebird has to be as better as the first was then to what was before. But one can achieve only one's goal.<br /><br />  I usually hate costume dramas, but usually love this one with one, but the whole film becomes a piece of cape, to boot. In fact, more: it's a cape caper to two boots. But that is entirely inconsequal, like half the film.<br /><br />____________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br /><br />2 MAJOR FLAWS<br /><br />  And yes, it's insane to have Lex Luther AGAIN. (Imagine if the Batman movies only had the joker.)<br /><br />  But more insane is his scheme - in the wrong way. And it all amounts to a huge piece Kraptonite. And as bland as big.<br /><br />  I return to The Bird with the Primary Plumage's absence for it must have affected his judgement. In the jet save (yes, not the bat cave), he ignored the most urgent situation to keep on with a finished task. Bizarre. That was doubly odd because he didn't need to do that for the plot, as normally happens.<br /><br />  Yet to mention the horrendous injuries the people would have from G-forces all the way in that jet scene, even just the bit viewed in the preview.<br /><br />  To say again what I haven't said: This film needs to be remade. Now! Or at least unmade.<br /><br />____________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br /><br />TO REPEAT...<br /><br /> There were a few fleeting times when Supe-baby was magic - such as in silent unexpected flight. But not only does the film seem the hotch potch result of all the past troubles, doubts, and revisions in getting it done, but mainly amounts to consistant pale, weak reminders of the first successful film where they did the work - properly! And if you think it's annoying how often I'm repeating that, you get the picture of the film.<br /><br />To reiterate, I regurgitate again what I repeated before on this floor<br /><br />____________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br /><br />SMALLBITSVILLE<br /><br />  One small note. I'd like to know where Superman got the plastic for his insigna. Was it part of the spaceship, or did he get it from a plastics shop? I like it though.<br /><br />  And, did S have brown eyes in the beginning, but in every other scene his eyes are blue?<br /><br />And why is his cape and boots mauve? Mauve (n): A moderate grayish violet to moderate reddish purple.<br /><br />  Finally, firstly, I want to see a SuperMAN like the comics - with the build of Mr UNIVERSE.<br /><br />THEN he'd look right, instead of annorexic or mere mortal.<br /><br />  God knows what the sequal to this one will be - a remake of this one? I mean, it takes remakes onestep further, doesn't it, taking Hollywood's entropy further - into insanity?<br /><br />  I am over the age of 1300.her, doesn't it, taking Hollywood's entropy further - into insanity? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />  I am over the age of 1300.  <br /> <br /> <br />

B00006AG5N|5.0|As well as being the most successful performer of all time ,Elvis Presley is also the most ridiculed.In the end though, all that will matter is the musical legacy  he left behind. Of all the 800+ songs that he recorded there are only a handful that could be considered trash. As well as the standard hits which are found on this album , there is a abundance of rarer tracks to be found on box sets and the \\"Follow That Dream \\" BMG label which caters to the fans who have to have everything!. Elvis was probably the most versatile singer of all time and because of his willingness to try styles that other singers wouldnt even attempt , we are left with magical music to satisfy us for a long time to come.Long Live The King!!.
B000AP04EW|1.0|I suspect my 1 star rating is the exception but this movie was simply awful.  Had it been a total spoof like Airplane, it may have been okay.  But since the movie had a dumb story and way too much violence, it was more like a Saturday morning cartoon with bad acting.  I am sure glad the rental fee was only one dollar.  It was worth less than a buck, unfortunately.

1932100660|5.0|Howard Jacobson's review is right on. I have a Cultural Anthropology degree from UOA which doesn't mean much these days but I have to comment on this book. My interest in the foods we consume is strictly from a nutritional standpoint and stopped eating 'red' meat in college. Sometime around 1976 I had a required reading \\"Diet for Small planet\\" for a class at Stockton State which opened my eyes to the controversy around the science and political aspects of feeding our planet. Great book!  We now get a slew of information brought to us from video, internet and other resources. What is good for us? Really? I think I have a good idea and feel great but if we all read this book 25 years ago - we would all feel a lot better. Anyway, Look around you. We are a \\"BIG\\" planet especially in the US. I know people with cancer, diabetes, high cholesterol, people who can't loose weight, can't sleep people at 50 who loose their breath walking up stairs. I know a guy who has problems with his intestinal track and the internist never asked him what he eats! Sadly many doctors don't have time to get into nutritional counseling but IMHO, they should. If this is your first book on nutrition, don't take pieces from chapters out of context. Be sure to read the whole chapter and how he's gathered data. The pages turn fast and his writing style makes it very easy to read. I love the chapter which covers the food pyramid. I've never trusted the many food pyramids over the years and still don't. I'm comparing topics in his book to other nutrition books, along with a many googled links. This is great place to start if you are concerned about your health or a loved one who is ill. Like it or not, we are what you eat. Thank you Colin Campbell for a great book-you are awesome! I like many others would be so proud to make a contribution to society that ultimately has an impact on the people in our lives and the families we love.
B000G75AE8|3.0|Much better than the last, you can tell that Dave is back - but not a whole lot of hooks in it. It also seems they are lyrically trying too hard to be anti-religion to the point where they parody themselves. The new Majur Bludd album is gonna blow this one away!
B000002U8G|4.0|Meddle was released in 1971 and was Pink Floyd's sixth studio album, following The Piper at the Gates of Dawn, A Saucerful of Secrets, Music From the Film More, Ummagumma, and Atom Heart Mother. At this point in time, David Gilmour was the pioneer of the band's sound. Gilmour is also probably one of the best guitarists still living and exemplifies the \\"minimalist\\" style of playing. <br /> <br />The first track, \\"One of These Days\\", is an interesting and skillfully woven instrumental that builds up to the heavily distorted, slowed-down, German-accented, almost Satanic-sounding spoken vocal part provided by drummer Nick Mason, \\"One of these days I'm going to cut you into little pieces!\\" The instrumental \\"rocks out\\" as effectively as Pink Floyd has ever \\"rocked out\\" until fading into the sound of wind, which segues into the next track. <br /> <br />\\"A Pillow of Winds\\" is mostly easy listening. There are a few progressive guitar breaks and key changes here and there, but it doesn't demand the listener's attention nor does it make any attempt to deliberately hook them in. It's not a bad song, but it's not as good as \\"One of These Days\\" and any selection from the masterpiece albums of Wish You Were Here and The Dark Side of the Moon cleanly and clearly outdo it. <br /> <br />The next cut, \\"Fearless\\", features a bit more interesting and rich instrumental work and somewhat more inspired lyrics. Here, Pink Floyd clearly has not lost their psychadelic artsy edge, as it begins with and then fades out to end with a rousing chorus of the traditional English song \\"You'll Never Walk Alone\\" by a full crowd at a stadium game. Definitely an album highlight. <br /> <br />\\"San Tropez\\" is a jazzy number that follows \\"Fearless\\". Now, from almost any other band, it'd sound pleasant and relaxing. From a psychadelic prog-rock band like Pink Floyd, it's highly disconcerting and almost creepy. It leaves me feeling kind of cold, even though the song is supposed to be warm and upbeat. Floyd should definitely stick with the darker material. <br /> <br />This is followed by a barely 2+ minute affair called \\"Seamus\\" after the dog who performs vocals on it. Yeah, that's right. A dog has lead vocals on this song. The band's clearly having some tongue-in-cheek fun here, and it's not a song that's meant to be taken seriously. There's some mellow acoustic-blues stuff going on, but it's nothing to write home about and it feels out of place on a post-Piper Pink Floyd studio album. <br /> <br />Side B is the 23-minute epic piece entitled \\"Echoes\\", and it is...it is quite possibly the best single song that Pink Floyd ever made. It stays refreshing and engaging throughout the full duration of the song, with brilliantly used guitars and sonic textures seldom sounding redundant in the slightest. The lyrics at the beginning and end are also crafted; the song flows like aural poetry, and it's probably the best single reason for anyone to buy Meddle. <br /> <br />As a whole, the album isn't anywhere near as solid as The Dark Side of the Moon, Animals, or Wish You Were Here; it doesn't have as many bright spots as The Wall; still, it remains a worthy album. Multiple listens are key to understanding and fully appreciating the music here, as with other often-overlooked masterpieces as Supertramp's Crisis? What Crisis? and Rush's Grace Under Pressure. <br /> <br />If you're already familiar with some of Pink Floyd's work and you want to explore other elements of the sound, pick this album up and give it a fair listen or two.

B000002Q88|2.0|This album doesn't even merit a full, detailed review. Two songs, \\"Stand Beside Me\\" and \\"I Counted On Love\\" are actually good. \\"Bells Of Saint James\\" is decent as well. The rest is pretty much not good, with some songs being in fact difficult to listen to. <br /> <br />And this is the same Kansas that put out \\"Song for America\\", \\"Dust in the Wind\\", \\"Carry On Wayward Son\\", \\"Point of Know Return\\", and \\"Questions of My Childhood\\"? Seriously? <br /> <br />In fact, a lot of the songs mark a blatant surrender to power balladry. From a band like Kansas, nearly all of these attempts fall flat - this territory's already been covered, and much more effectively, by bands like Journey, REO Speedwagon, Boston, and Styx. The composition of the songs and the instrumentation used on them makes most of the album sound badly dated; the warmth of the violin used so effectively in the '70s and on 2000's Somewhere to Elsewhere is nonpresent. This is, simply put, a different Kansas. <br /> <br />Unless you're either a diehard Kansas fan who worships anything they do or quite the opposite - someone who doesn't care for the classic material of Kansas and prefers bands like Foreigner, Journey, REO Speedwagon, Survivor, Toto, and Air Supply - don't even bother picking this one up.
0440224764|5.0|The Partner has quite an outrageous story line, but the way in which Grisham tells the story is absolutely amazing: starting with the climax, Grisham leaves the reader confused and uncertain on his or her feelings for certain characters; as he works backwards telling the story leading up to the climax through events in the present, all the pieces fall into place and the confusing events and feelings in the beginning now make perfect sense.<br /><br />Yet another great novel from John Grisham.
B000006TRV|4.0|The format of The Wall, a double-album released by Pink Floyd in 1979 under the primary direction of Roger Waters, is surprising - it's not a concept album in the same way that The Dark Side of the Moon and Animals are. It's much more akin to the format and storyline of a rock opera, the likes of which are best represented by the famous Who releases Tommy and Quadrophenia and, more recently, Green Day's American Idiot. <br /> <br />The Wall opens somewhat mildly with \\"In the Flesh?\\" but it explodes into a heavy, pumping Floyd number less than halfway through. From the moment Roger Waters begins to sing, one gets the Tommy-esque feeling of a rock opera. The album follows the story of a rock star, cleverly named Pink, who builds a wall to isolate himself from the soundaholic world. The song ends with the cries of an infant, as the look into Pink's past begins. <br /> <br />\\"The Thin Ice\\" is a nice, typically cynical number warning Pink not to be surprised if the thin ice he walks on cracks beneath him. It's not a standout, but little on this album is - it's a rock opera. What do you expect? <br /> <br />\\"Another Brick in the Wall, Pt. 1\\", however, is a standout. It begins the trilogy of songs based around the same melody and introduces it as a theme, a leitmotif for the increasingly disillusioned Pink and is a very solid, masterful song. <br />It leads into the ironically named \\"The Happiest Days of Our Lives\\", which sounds almost apocalyptic with the sound of propellers, the growling vocals of Waters, and the organ playing some theme of doom. The Wall is rich with these sorts of ominous-sounding numbers. <br /> <br />\\"Another Brick in the Wall, Pt. 2\\" immediately follows, opening with a scream of frustration. This may be one of Pink Floyd's better-known and most often quoted songs, featuring the voices of a children's choir. The song seems to be about the oppressive schooled upbringing of Pink, which tried to blot out his creative expression. The line \\"We don't needno thought control\\" is especially indicative of this concept, and is a theme that Waters seems to revisit frequently in his work after The Wall. <br /> <br />The sounds of a telephone signal come into the next song, \\"Mother\\". It's rather disconcerting, as it takes the image of a loving, nurturing mother and twists it into the image of a mother who is so nurturing that she tries to control everything in Pink's life. It's a soft ballad that forces the listener to pay attention to the meaning, which is prototypical of later Waters works and at the same time reminiscent of the 1971 album Meddle. <br /> <br />\\"Goodbye Blue Sky\\" again returns to the theme suggested in \\"The Happiest Days of Our Lives\\": that of the Luftwaffe bombing of England during the early years of World War II. An innocent English child, over the sound of distant propeller engines, proclaims, \\"Look, mummy, there's an aeroplane up in the sky!\\" before the soft vocals enter to ask the \\"why?\\" questions of the bombs falling on England. It's a beautiful song. <br /> <br />\\"Empty Spaces\\" continues from there, pondering what Pink would have to do to fill the holes in his life. Roger Waters, being a rock star himself, doubtless made The Wall somewhat autobiographical - in fact, his father was killed in World War II - and seems to be writing about how empty a life of fame and adoration can be. <br /> <br />The next song, \\"Young Lust\\", slams into the theme of carnal desire as Pink seeks to fill the emptiness with sex to try to make everything feel better and fuller. It's a pretty good rock number, really, quite atypical of normal Pink Floyd. <br /> <br />\\"One of My Turns\\" preludes the actual sung vocals with the voice of a groupie talking to Pink and trying to get in bed with him, but Pink is unresponsive, eyes glued to the television. Finally, as the actual song begins, the lyrics indicate Pink's devastating rant about how he feels depressed and lifeless and makes allusions to death, then - as the song kicks into overdrive - begins asking what she wants: \\"Would you like to watch T.V.? / Or get between the sheets? / Or contemplate the silent freeway? / Would you like something to eat? / Would you like to learn to fly? /Would'ya? /Would you like to see me try?\\" At the end of the song, the horrified groupie flees from him, and he wonders why she's leaving. <br /> <br />\\"Don't Leave Me Now\\" focuses on Pink's feelings of loneliness and abandonment. It's a soft-spoken piece that, again, requires concentration. The song ends with more voices and chatter. <br /> <br />Again, the scream of Pink - more intense this time - signals the beginning of a new part of \\"Another Brick in the Wall\\", now Pt. 3. Barely over a minute long, this vignette illustrates Pink's belief that everyone is a brick in the wall. <br /> <br />\\"Goodbye Cruel World\\" is also short and difficult to interpret. It sounds as if it could be about suicide, but in the context of the album, it is Pink's farewell to the world as he finishes his wall to shut out reality. <br /> <br />Disc 2 begins with \\"Hey You\\", on which David Gilmour plays bass while Roger Waters takes over lead guitar duty. The song is an increasingly desperate plea to be felt, heard, touched, helped, and above all else, understood. It's an excellent song and a definite highlight of the album. <br /> <br />\\"Is There Anybody Out There?\\" is an inquiring acoustic number as Pink wonders if anyone is left. The wall seems to just make him feel even more lonely and trapped than before. He probably should have taken that into account before building it...but then this album wouldn't ever exist. <br /> <br />\\"Nobody Home\\" contains an allusion back to Animals, with Waters being a \\"dog\\", and juxtaposes everything surrounding him with the overall theme of meaninglessness. Nothing holds any value for him. <br /> <br />It transitions cleanly into \\"Vera\\", about a love that Pink once held who left from his life. He remembers her and wonders what's become of her, endingwith the lines \\"Does anybody else in here / Feel the way I do?\\" <br /> <br />\\"Bring The Boys Back Home\\" is Waters's somewhat obligatory vague political protest statement until entering into the setup for \\"Comfortably Numb\\", with repeated knocking on a door and the call, \\"Time to go-o!\\" <br /> <br />This transitions right into \\"Comfortably Numb\\", inspired by the feeling of numbness that David Gilmour had when he was struck with fever as a child (the reference is even made in the song's lyrics). It's a fairly gentle, flowing song melodically, somewhat recalling the feel of \\"Us and Them\\" from The Dark Side of the Moon. My interpretation of the song is that it's about Pink's disengagement from reality at a concert, echoing Syd Barrett's mental disorder and drug-induced habit of going catatonic, detuning his guitar, and/or playing the wrong song at live shows. <br /> <br />\\"The Show Must Go On\\", in turn, echoes the resigned determination with which the rest of Barrett's band kept on playing despite their leader's incapacitation as Pink relinquishes his hold on reality. But it's from Pink's perspective as he wonders why he can't just go home and if it's too late to get his \\"soul\\" back. <br /> <br />Returning to the theme with which The Wall kicks off, \\"In the Flesh\\" thunders to life as Pink snaps and assumes the role of a Hitler-esque dictator. The song is heavy and dark; the lyrics begin as this caricatured alterego of Pink renounces relation to his true or former self - \\"Pink isn't well he stayed back at the hotel / And they sent us along as a surrogate band\\" - and then begins to insult and deride the minorities in the audience, declaring at last, \\"If I had my way I'd have all of you shot\\" before the song segues into the next. <br /> <br />\\"Run Like Hell\\" begins with funky keyboard effects, then percussion, then the guitar work of Pink Floyd. The band really showcases their brilliance here. Pink breaks down and flees here, but truly the focus of this movement of the album is now on the music. The lyrics are paranoid and manic for Pink's shattered mind, and towards the end of the song the sounds of an angry crowd, squealing brakes, manic laughter, and the scream that opened \\"Another Brick in the Wall, Pt. 2\\" can all be heard. <br /> <br />\\"Waiting For the Worms\\" bizarrely opens with a Doobie-like \\"ooh-ooh-ooh\\" section, briefly. Pink has been caught and jailed, and, as the song's name suggests, he's \\"waiting for the worms\\" (previously alluded to in \\"Hey You\\") to eat through him. The \\"I Am The Walrus\\"-like vocal distortion used in Animals' \\"Pigs (Three Different Ones)\\" is used for Pink's insane monologuing that echoes the concentration camps of the Holocaust. The \\"Another Brick in the Wall\\" leitmotif also makes a reappearance in a few sections. Darkly, the song whispers into Pink's brain, offering him the deluded power that might have taken hold of Adolf Hitler. <br /> <br />\\"Stop\\" lasts only thirty seconds, but is long enough for Pink to break free of this alterego. He cries out, \\"Stop!\\" and the whispers are gone. <br /> <br />\\"The Trial\\" isn't a personal favorite of mine. It sounds like a scene from a musical, with Pink on trial and lawyers with exaggerated English accents sing-songing the court proceedings and their arguments. Interestingly, the judge is referred to as \\"worm\\" along with \\"Your Honor\\". The line, \\"Crazy...he is crazy...\\" repeats again and again, the familiar leitmotif of \\"Another Brick in the Wall\\" appears again, and the voice of the \\"worm\\" judge echoes in a sinister way. The song ends with his demand to tear down the wall, echoed by the people gathered in the courtroom over a full, orchestral performance of the ominous theme. The sound of explosions demolishing the wall ends the song. <br /> <br />With genuine wonderment, The Wall emerges into its closing song, \\"Outside the Wall\\", with Pink narrating the start of his new life outside the wall as the children's choir sings in the background. The song doesn't quite last two minutes, and has no strong musical backing to speak of. <br /> <br />In an interesting note, the words \\"Isn't this where -\\" quickly spoken at the end of \\"Outside the Wall\\" join up with the words that open \\"In the Flesh?\\", \\"We came in?\\" This suggests that the concept behind The Wall is circular and that the story might simply repeat itself again and again, cyclic. <br /> <br />I don't like it as well as The Dark Side of the Moon or Wish You Were Here, or even Animals, and I doubt I ever will...it seems too long, and the whole \\"Hitler\\" thing just seems bizarre to me. But it's still a good album, with an especially strong first disc, and is still worth the buy. The Wall really marks the last strong group effort of Pink Floyd, as The Final Cut is (admittedly) a treatise by Roger Waters performed by Pink Floyd. <br /> <br />If you listen carefully, you can still hear that old connection to Meddle - the whale song from \\"Echoes\\" even makes an appearance. It's a nice throwback and it's good to remember that this is really still the same Pink Floyd, just a few years older and a lifetime more embittered.

B000024D4R|5.0|Animals was Pink Floyd's ninth studio album and came out in 1977 as the somewhat bleaker successor to Wish You Were Here. It is currently certified Quadruple Platinum, though it initially wasn't well-received in the U.S. <br /> <br />The opening track is very reminiscent of earlier Pink Floyd, such as the pastoral second and third tracks of Meddle. It is entitled \\"Pigs On The Wing (Part One)\\" and seems to contain an allusion to 1984 by George Orwell with the line, \\"Wondering which of the brothers to blame\\"; in fact, the entire album concept seems to be inspired by Orwell's other literary classic, Animal Farm. This opener is a bit of a throwaway, really. This sort of album deserves a darker, more experimental, more powerful opening piece. <br /> <br />The next cut, \\"Dogs\\", weighs in at over 17 minutes long. Each of the three extended pieces that are the meat of Animals classifies a group of human beings; the \\"dogs\\" are the businessmen and the bureaucrats, who bully and cheat and derive enjoyment from the suffering of others whom they control to feed their own greed. David Gilmour delivers excellent guitar work here, as through the rest of the album. It's not catchy or immediately gripping, and casual listeners won't find much here to entertain them. Listening more closely reveals the reward of this work. <br /> <br />\\"Pigs (Three Different Ones)\\" was to be the subject of the August 4, 2006 edition of The Word, but...this was sadly not to be. The \\"pigs\\" are the people who cite moral, political, spiritual, and/or religious authority and righteousness as their reason for the masses to obey them. Roger Waters, the lyricist for the band, announces, \\"Ha, ha! Charade, you are...\\" in mockery, claiming to see through their empty veneer to the despicable, power-hungry, manipulating, conniving, personally motivated souls that they are. This song also probably marks Pink Floyd's first use of the infamous F-bomb, in the second verse, allegedly about British politician and formerPrime Minister Margaret Thatcher, a hardline Conservative hated by the band and by Waters especially. This song is catchy and technically very ambitious, but successful in its approach. Probably my favorite Animals cut and one of my new favorite Pink Floyd pieces. <br /> <br />\\"Sheep\\" concludes this trilogy of animalization of human beings, classifying those who aren't on the ill-gotten pedestals of the dogs or pigs as \\"sheep\\". These masses follow the leader blindly unto the slaughter, but towards the end of the song, they rebel and destroy the dogs. The vocals of Waters on this song are blistering and smiting in their style and approach; in terms of sound, this might be the angriest Pink Floyd piece to date. While \\"Pigs (Three Different Ones)\\" sounds bitter, \\"Sheep\\" sounds like a bitter tirade against the human race. And it is. <br /> <br />The album is bookended by \\"Pigs On The Wing (Part Two)\\", which seems to describe Waters as a dog who \\"needs a home / A shelter from pigs on the wing\\", as the pigs even exploit and use their fellow tyrants, the dogs, as in Animal Farm. Despite this, it's an anticlimactic and lackluster beginning and end for such a deep, dark-gloried work of art and something shorter, but more in the vein of Wish You Were Here's two sections of \\"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\\" would seem more fitting here. <br /> <br />It's not quite as incredible as The Dark Side of the Moon - but really, what is? Regardless, the album is excellent. The cynicism may alienate many listeners, but to those who are appreciative of this new point of view and perspective on the human race, at once similar to and divergent from George Orwell's take on things, Animals is a masterpiece. <br /> <br />I think that if the album has one major flaw, it's that Waters and his band don't truly convince. I never, while listening to this album, said to myself, \\"Oh, yeah, this Mary Whitehouse is a real moron!\\" or, \\"Roger Waters is totally right. Everyone is the world is a dog, a pig, ora sheep.\\" It's an interesting perspective, taken in context, but especially on \\"Pigs (Three Different Ones)\\" - even though it's my favorite song on the album - despite there being some good \\"snaps\\" (\\"You radiate cold shafts of broken glass\\" is just a great line), it really just sounds like Waters and whoever else in the band actually contributed to the message of the album...sounds like they're just pissed off and have put their genius to the grinder to put out a well-crafted, masterful album about how mad these people make them. <br /> <br />With that in mind, it's still excellent. Oh, and the musical composition and performances approach perfection, as always.
B0000VAFO0|5.0|One of the best horror films in years.It has great photography, <br />sets,costumes,special effects,and excellent Marco Beltrami music.It also has a good script and solid direction that keep <br />things moving,create a genuinely creepy mood and atmosphere,and <br />really work up quite a head of suspense.The action sequences are <br />top-notch.And the cast is excellent.Derek Jacobi and Bill Nighy <br />are terrific,Scott Speedman is very good,and best of all Kate <br />Beckinsale is a knockout!
B0007Y08QA|3.0|Christian Bale is very impressive in this movie. He became so skinny for this movie that at some camera shots he barely seems to be alive. The Machinist offers you an intriging story about a factory worker who obviously should be able to be in a way better job than he is now. Throughout the movie the answer to this mystery is slowly revealed. Although the plot is satisfactory and the acting is fine, some pieces of the plot are not being explained well enough. However anyone who can still appreciate a movie that doesn't need lots of action to keep the viewers awake, will enjoy The Machinist. (SARR)
B00005JOQS|3.0|I had read a lot of good reviews about this movie, so I was excited to see it. But after watching the movie I was frankly disapointed. The plot is mainley just Superman saving some more people and by the end of the movie he stays a hero. At the end of the movie I thought more would of happened, but really Superman didn't even go on that many exciting adventures. It may be time to give up the Superman sequels, because this movie was a major disapointment.
B00008RH3L|4.0|Because the Coen brothers style was relatively unknown when \\"Miller's Crossing\\" was released back in 1990, most critics and viewers took it to be just another run of the mill gangster thriller; notable only for the complexity of its story elements. The Dashiell Hammett type story is told from the point of view of Tom (Gabriel Byrne), an adviser to a prohibition era Irish crime boss named Leo (Albert Finney).     Although it appears to be a serious (and violent) gangster film with a straightforward story, it is actually a huge inside joke with the Coens showing both reverence and irreverence for their genre. Or more correctly \\"genres\\", as there is mixing of 1920-30's gangster movie elements with the film noir style of the 1940-50's. \\"Miller's Crossing\\" has a very fabricated production design with the stylized dialogue to match; giving it an unreal feel, a bit like the \\"Serenity\\" movie which mixed space and cowboys.     Albert Finney and Jon Polito (as Johnny Caspar) are especially good as rival crime bosses. The film can only be truly appreciated by those well acquainted with the film traditions of its two genres, but it still works on a basic gangster picture level.    The obvious comparison is \\"Reservoir Dogs\\", if only because the Coens and Tarantino are serious students of cinema history and film theory who carefully wove this stuff into their respective films. Yet there is considerable originally within these otherwise derivative works, both self-conscious reverential tributes and biting parodies of film conventions.     Both films fit the writer/director classification, where the director is responsible for translating his own vision to the screen. The Coen vision is translated into an expressionistic world, which is superficially convincing as being real. The pseudo realism is self-sustaining because the characters behave as if they believe in it. The repeated inquiry \\"what's the rumpus\\" works within the film's reality but would be a strange question to hear today on a sixth grade playground.     As the film progresses and these phrases of stylized gangster talk are repeated in service to the plot, the viewer assimilates them and the world of the film becomes increasingly familiar, becoming a world they know.     \\"Miller's Crossing\\" has a more complex story than \\"Reservoir Dogs\\" and more of a comic book quality. Its main exaggeration is the transitional device of having the hero get unrealistically beaten up between virtually every scene change. The sequences with the corrupt mayor and police are also comic book surreal.     At the time of release critics and audiences were not familiar with what would become the Coen's comedy trademark, the disconnection between the way their characters should talk and behave (per film convention) and the way the Coen's actually script them. This was less apparent in \\"Miller's Crossing\\" than in their later films, coming mainly in the discourses by Leo and Casper on ethics and codes of loyalty, and in the caricature of Casper's fat spoiled son.    Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.
B000EHRVP6|4.0|First off - there's quite a bit of Hollywood B.S. used to promote this film, but it's still pretty good in my opinion. Contrary to the promotional copy, there is no \\"shortage\\" of men in Slovakia.  World War II was a LONG time ago. So if there is an ample supply of willing women, that's probably due more to a shortage of hard currency than anything else. Also, there is corruption in all of the former Eastern Bloc countries, but the roving bands of ten-year-old outlaws featured in the film is pure fantasy. I've been to Slovakia. It's a poor country, but the people there are quite civil, I assure you.  <br /> <br />This film isn't nearly as \\"pointless\\" or lacking in a plot as many of the other reviewers claim. I think it's one hell of a great plot idea, actually. Sad to say, I suspect there are people in this world who would run a torture-murder for profit business if they thought they could get away with it. In fact, we've seen that with \\"Murder Incorporated\\" during the Mafia's golden years.  <br /> <br />This film is frightening because human beings who torture and murder others for kicks are REAL, as opposed to space aliens, werewolves, and vampires. I found the storyline, acting, special effects and editing quite good. And most importantly, the film succeeded in scaring me, which is the point of all horror films, after all.  <br /> <br />Yes, it is filled with gratuitous violence and gore. This film is definitely not for the squeamish. It's a film about a TORTURE CHAMBER, folks!!! Blood and gore goes with the territory. \\"Hostel\\" pushes the envelope of gore, so don't watch it if you have a weak stomach. I'm a life-long horror fan, but even I found it hard to watch at times. Most definitely NOT for the kiddies.  <br /> <br />The only fault I would find with this film is with a few scenes that were too gratuitous, even for a splatter film. The \\"eyeball popping out of the head\\" scene, for instance, is the stuff of cheap grade C movies, as is a following scene involvinga decapitation by train.  <br /> <br />But horror films were never intended to be high art. And those few horror films that attempt to be so \\"intellectual\\" usually fail miserably to scare anyone. \\"Interview With A Vampire\\" comes to mind. Slept all the way through that one. You won't sleep through this film, I guarantee you.  <br /> <br />P.S one more comment - \\"Based on a true story\\" is really getting old. Come up with a new B.S. line promote these films, will ya?
B00009V7T2|5.0|The Cd starts with the intro song which begins slow and soft. To start off slow and soft would be have been sort of a bad for Mars Volta if they didn't have a perfectly good reason to do so. What I'm getting at is that track 1 simply preps your mind for the songs afterward to make sure that you're head doesn't explode. <br /> <br />For people that have never listened to Mars Volta before I suggest listening to the Cd track by track in the correct order for saftey purposes (Atleast for the first time) insted of skipping through tracks for a song that can provide quick satisfaction. There is a lot in this Cd that demands to be savored. So if you get this Cd do yourself a favor and try and listen to the whole thing in 1 sitting even know it's a long Cd, you will most likley have gotten a better understanding of it's awsomeness.
B000G75AE8|5.0|i have been a DIE HARD slayer fan since 1990.  they have always been my favorite band.  unlike many people, i loved divine itnervention and it is the most listened to by far out of my slayer collection, although of course reign in blood is still tops on my \\"best\\" list. <br /> <br />diabolus and god hates us all disapointed me a bit, but there were still good songs on both albums.  i just figured they were getting some experimentation out of thier system. <br /> <br />well, christ illusion absolutely SLAYS.  fast, heavy, satanic, violent, everything you want in a slayer album.  many people feel the over the top religion bashing is stupid and played out, not me, i LOVE it.  this album is EXACTLY what i wanted to hear.  every song is good, with \\"cult\\" and \\"jihad\\" being standouts in my opinion. <br /> <br />if you liked old slayer, i do not possibly see how you would dislike this.  its thier fastest and heaviest cd, PERIOD. <br /> <br />slayer are KINGS, PLAIN AND SIMPLE
B000002MY3|4.0|Radio-friendly rock music had a new queen once Alanis Morissette stepped into the picture here.  Her oft-excruciatingly personal lyrics and blazingly unique singing scored her numerous radio smashes and with her first official rock record Jagged Little Pill the Grammy-winning singer-songwriter delivers one of the best albums in music history.  From its first international No. 1 smash \\"You Oughta Know,\\" album Jagged Little Pill's presence became known on the charts with numerous other hit singles like \\"All I Really Want,\\" \\"Hand In My Pocket,\\" \\"You Learn,\\" \\"Head Over Feet\\" and \\"Ironic.\\"  Morissette has a slight misstep here with the cooing sometimes-good-sometimes-just-so-off ballad \\"Perfect\\" and \\"Mary Jane,\\" Pill's most unmemorable moments--but in the end this genuine songstress produces original and unbelievably unique rock music with real hurt and heart.
B000EULJLU|3.0|Ah, the new Tool album is finally out in stores...you hear the first singles \\"Vicarous\\" and \\"The Pot\\" and you rush out to buy the album. You listen to it all the way through and...what's this? You have a 5 minute final track with no audible vocals..and very few even inaudible vocalizations? Then you listen to the sixth track...which is less than a third the length of your average tool song, and is completely gibberish? This is a solid CD, it has great songs like, \\"Vicarious\\", \\"The Pot\\", \\"Right In Two\\", and \\"Jambi\\", but it's basically a 4 track album pretending its got 11 songs on it..all carefully spread apart to keep you listening long after your bored to death by the long, drawn out vocal-less songs.
B00097A5HW|3.0|Colombian rock goddess Shakira is quite the performer.  The talented hip-shaker extraordinaire gives an impassioned performance in her trademark throaty-and-nasal bleat over the course of 12 addictive Spanish language tracks that make up Fijacion Oral Vol. 1.  The standout here is, of course, the No. 1 global smash \\"La Tortura\\" featuring sexy call-and-response dialogue with Latin singer Alejandro Sanz (\\"La Tortura\\" is also presented in a remixed format but sits far below its original mix).  The opener (featured in English on the later English language Oral Fixation Vol. 2) \\"En Tus Pupilas\\" is soft and sensual with its European-influenced mystique and chordal Spanish guitar, but unfortunately it's not one of Fijacion Oral's most memorable moments (aforementioned \\"La Tortura\\" holds that spot deservedly) and could keep listeners from delving deeper into the complex and individual workings of the remainder of the album.  The bleaterrific \\"La Pared\\" showcases Shakira's rich and unique vocals, and is offered up in both original and acoustic versions.  \\"Lo Imprescindible\\" officially closes the record with its thundering drums and incredibly rock-oriented rhythm and beats.  In the end, it's an interesting listen with few highs, but the English language Oral Fixation Vol. 2 is much more consistent and likable.
B00000JQFM|4.0|Not of this Earth was the test run, Flying in a Blue Dream got everyones attention and this, this is the real deal. Not a heapin' number of years after the debut and this is a vastly more mature and more lively release. Gone are the overly mellow tracks to be replaced with a raft of blasting guitar histrionics. And purists can still find plenty to allay their fears that Satriani may of dumbed down for commercial acceptance as there are still plenty of tasteful touches and studio trickery.<br /><br />On this album Satriani throws out two great tracks up front, Surfing w/the Alien and Ice 9 and both are wonderful tunes that swoop and soar. Backed up by Always With Me, Always With You - Joe just about reaches a level of connection with the listener that is the preserve of vocals albums.<br /><br />This release saw Satriani become a bona fide guitar god and had him, like Vai, dabbling with mainstream success which was practically unheard of for instrumental rock music. Ultimately this is the album to buy if you want a Satriani album. It will allow the newcomer to appreciate all his talent and on an album that's not  too dense and it's also a perfect start for anyone wanting some instrumental guitar albums due to Satrianis' easy on the ear playing - whether he's shredding or making his guitar weep all over the backing music. The guy can send piercing wails at you with the bst of them. but chooses to do so only when appropriate as his bag of tricks spans more than just a deft touch with arpeggios and 64th notes. Which sort of explains his sailes figures!
B000A3DFZE|4.0|Ok so I have maybe rated this album higher than I would have had I typed this out last year after having had 1 listen to the album. (I would have ripped the album to shreds quite frankly) but as it turns out, having put it away for many a month and listening to Cream's reunion concert album I kinda like it. <br /> <br />There was never any question about the quality of the album from a production standpoint. It was purely that the song material was a little \\"soft\\". If you are as big a fan of Slowhand as I am (and I know ther are countless thousands of us out there) you'll know that his career is not without a couple of suprises. I guess following up a couple of very solid, vibrant and all out raw (in the case of Songs for Robert J) takes on the blues master's songs a soft rock album with very little in the way of exciting improvised lead lines is just another of those suprises. <br /> <br />I'm not going to sit and pick apart each song on the album. I just want to point out that this album is the ultimate symbol of EC having conquered his demons. Here stands a man who in the last 30 years has nearly killed himself with addiction, lost a child and yet stands on the other side producing an album of such divine contentment. Don't see this album as a weak trade off for what EC is capable of. Rather see it as the album of a happy, contented family man who released the album HE wanted to release.
B000G75AE8|5.0|I've been a Slayer fan from the beginning when Show No Mercy came out originally on vinyl/cassette in 1983.  ;)  (gave away my age there).<br /><br />While I do agree with most fans that Slayer peaked both in terms of commercial and most importantly critically with 1990's Seasons in the Abyss, I feel that their newest release Christ Illusion is the best release the band has done since that album.<br /><br />Now, I should also state that I'm not one of the old school metal fans that expects everything that Slayer puts out to sound like either Reign in Blood or Seasons in the Abyss as well.<br /><br />I thought that Divine Intervention was very good, Diabolous in Musica was good and God Hates Us All was good as well. (The only thing that they've done that I out right hated was their punk covers album Undisputed Attitude but it doesn't really count as it is a covers album.)<br /><br />But I still feel that Slayer had been on a bit of a creative slide during the Paul Bostaph drum era mentioned in the above paragraph.<br /><br />Having original skinsman Dave Lombardo back behind the kit has really lit a fire under the band's collective posteriors as well from how the new album sounds.<br /><br />The album has an energy and a vitality that the band hasn't exhibited since Seasons in the Abyss. The song arrangements are for the most part some of the most well written and intricate of the band's career. Tom Araya's vocals have regained their sense of range and urgency and thankfully avoid the strained sounding style that he was displaying on 2001's God Hates Us All.<br /><br />Kerry King wrote 7 of the 10 tracks all by himself and Tom Araya and Jeff Hanneman collaborated on the remaining 3 tracks.<br /><br />The production is also the best since Seasons, though my only small gripe is that the vocals at a few points could have been a bit higher in the mix.<br /><br />A great album and a great harbinger of what future releases will be like now that the man Lombardo is back behind the kit.Lombardo is back behind the kit.
B0000AUHQT|4.0|Throughout American literature, surely no icons existed more dramatically than F. Scott Fitzgerald and his beautiful wife Zelda Sayre.  Disgustingly self-indulgent as they may appear to modern sensibilities, they were the epitome of youth, celebrity, and \\"modernism\\" to a generation struggling to shed the vestiges of World War I and escape from the reality of agrarian life and work.  As he did with virtually everything he wrote, F. Scott Fitzgerald borrowed generously from his own life and relationships to create The Great Gatsby.  The story has endured countless interpretations by critique and Hollywood, but the Gatsby played by Robert Redford comes as close to presenting the genuine tone of the original book as can be seen.  The performance, at once sensitive and brittle, tells the story, but if viewers take it on face value, it is a mediocre Hollywood attempt at recreating its own shallow values and hidden peversities.  Look closer, and what emerges is a deeply imagined commentary on dissipation and emotional poverty.  So many reviews of this fine movie have overlooked the absolute truth lying hidden beneath.  Performances by the cast seem to be superimposed over the everlasting strength of Fitzgerald's original prose.  It is thrilling to see 1920s frivolity recreated by modern hedenists (movie stars) who certainly could have moved freely in Scott and Zelda's circle, albeit sans literary pretentions. <br /> <br />The art direction is splendid -- tiny details (down to the minutia scattered across Mia Farrow's dressing table) support the lush cinematography of large vistas and even larger luxury.  This combination -- plus exquisite costuming and total absorption of the characters who tell Fitzgerald's story, create an overall effect that either woos audiences completely or leaves them gasping for air.  F. Scott Fitzgerald gives not a moment to the \\"realities\\" of life in the Roaring Twenties -- and the critics who blasted this movie as superficial missed the point entirely.  It was the essense of Gatsby and his story that both glamorized and destroyed the life to which they all clung obsessively.  Zelda's later fall into schizophrenic maddness, the Fitzgerald's constant need of money, and the disappearance of their lifestyle (with the onset of World War II) may have been the consequences of their excesses, but the movie audience's fascination with creatures utterly dedicated to their own pleasures and fantasies continues to keep The Great Gatsby in our collective cultural memory. Would you like to comment on this, Paris Hilton?

B00097A5I6|5.0|i read reviews from other Oasis fans, and i find it hard to believe what some say...i can honestly say that there's something i love about every one of their albums...yes, that includes 'Be Here Now' (\\"the girl in the dirty shirt\\", \\"stand by me\\", \\"magic pie\\", \\"don't go away\\"), 'Standing On The Shoulder Of Giants' (\\"roll it over\\", \\"sunday morning call\\", \\"go let it out!\\") and 'Heathen Chemistry' (\\"the hindu times\\", \\"stop crying your heart out\\", \\"(probably) all in the mind\\", \\"songbird\\"). Oasis are one of the most underrated bands here in america...it seems as though true rock 'n roll tends to be ignored by most here in the states. it's a shame, really. 'Don't Believe The Truth' is an excellent album. i'm not going to say that it's Oasis back in form...because to me, they're just as great as they've always been. it's obvious that this album was influenced by the '60s...but is that bad? i wouldn't say so. we've known from the beginning that they idolized The Beatles. i think that's why i love Oasis, though...The Beatles are my all-time favorite band, and Oasis are my favorite band from my generation...Oasis are the only band that even comes close to resembling The Beatles. for me, that's a great thing. with songs like \\"love like a bomb\\", \\"the importance of being idle\\" and \\"let there be love\\", you can't help but think it's great. liam & noel gallagher's voices are just as great as they've ever been, as well on this album...the duet \\"let there be love\\" is...it's hard to describe. for those who've heard \\"acquiesce\\", you'll know what i mean...whether you think \\"let there be love\\" is better, is entirely up to you. personally, i have my days when i think it is, then there are days when i don't...but, nonetheless, i love the song! liam's songs \\"love like a bomb\\" & \\"guess god thinks i'm abel\\" were favorites of mine right away...his songwriting has really become impressive over the years. if you have the opportunity, check out the song \\"pass me down the wine\\" which is a b-side onthe \\"the importance of being idle\\" single. it's one of liam's best songs to date. if you're just starting to listen to Oasis, well, this is a great album to start with...i can't say anything bad about it. if you've been an Oasis fan from the start, you're bound to love it. <br /> <br />\\"always in it, always on it, always want it...\\" -liam gallagher

B0000CC5CS|3.0|This movie is not as good as the first too,but it wasn't too shabby either.  I thought they could have found a hotter chick to play brewster.  I thought t-x was hot.  Arnold could have looked a little younger. All in all i think this movie was pretty good.
B000H5V8DG|5.0|\\"Alias\\" will always be one of my favorite television shows of all time. For me, it is right up there with shows like \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\" and \\"My So-Called Life\\", which also had strong, charismatic female leads. What makes \\"Alias\\" such a terrific show is not just the concept of Jennifer Garner kicking [...] in flattering disguises. There is also the fact that the storylines are so complex and creative that the show is bordering on science fiction, yet they are interlaced with heartwarming and very real, human moments (which seems to be J.J. Abrams specialty), not to mention the outstanding performances not only by Jennifer Garner herself, but also the show's two extremely talented lead actors, Victor Garber (Jack) and Ron Rifkin (Sloane). You couldn't ask for much more than this wonderful series, which is at times slick and action-packed with shocking revelations and at other times is just as easily light-hearted and endearing.
B000F5GNX8|4.0|it is very rare these days that a movie twists around so many times that my head figuratively twists off. Kiss Kiss Bang Bang didn't even give you a chance to really pay attention to any of the details long enough to really even make them matter. i found the narrative done by Robert Downy Jr added quite a little bit of spice to this movie removing any elements of seriousness this movie could have had.<br /><br />the performances were great for the roles they were supposed to play. the extremely fast pace had just about 0 minutes down time and if you stepped out of the room for a second, you missed quite a bit. i stepped out when the purple haired girl was killed so i had to back track a little. i really don't know who to recommend this to because it really had its own feel to it and most of the people i know don't have long enough attention spans to keep up with what the hell was going on. if you are at all curious though, it is worth checking out.
B000FIHCVC|5.0|This, together with \\"Next Year's Model\\" are my two favourite Elvis albums and this album is probably the best representative of his later works and is a creative highpoint.  This version has been very well remastered for a brilliant sound and the mini-lp sleeve packaging is a work of art in itself with both the Japanese and English lyrics included as an insert.<br /><br />Bearing little resemblence to his early punk days, the tracks here are a lot longer and take more time to develop.  I don't know where Amazon got its track information from but believe me, this album only has the first 15 tracks that they listed.  However, this is still overall a brilliant album with every track worthy of being on a best of compilation album of Elvis Costello.  My favourite track which was also a small hit single is \\"You Little Fool\\" but others like \\"Town Cryer\\" and \\"Man Out of Time\\" are also standout tracks.<br /><br />If you are looking for the best of Elvis' later and earlier works, look no further than this and \\"Next Year's Model\\".<br /><br />Highly recommended.

B00005YU1O|4.0|The ideas presented in this movie definitely don't come up in ordinary daily conversation.  It makes you question your reality in a way that \\"The Matrix\\" and \\"What The Bleep Do We Know?\\" do.  There were several animators working on the film, each working on a different scene, which made it more interesting.  One or two of the animation styles, however, were simplistic to the point that they \\"pulled me out\\" of the movie.  Fans of more \\"traditional\\" Western or Japanese animation, or of comic books, might like Linklater's latest film, A Scanner Darkly, a bit more.
B000F1IQN2|3.0|It is hard to believe that this movie was nominated for an Academy Award.  I know it is a true story, but I didn't find it very good.  It was too Godfatherish for my tastes.  I'm giving it three stars because the acting was very good, especially Eric Bana and Geoffrey Rush.
B000FQJAIW|5.0|The Trilogy released a couple years ago was NOT the original version.  They had to add CGI and Special Effects!  I don't understand how any fan of Star Wars would prefer the newer version over the original!  I've never bought the DVD Trilogy because it wasn't the original.  Now, on September 12, I'll be able to buy the original versions from the Trilogy the way they were intended to be watched!
0156027321|3.0|After a shipwreck, a man is trapped in a lifeboat with a Bengal tiger, fortunately, one that was elevated in a zoo: `if an animal could choose, it would opt for living in a zoo, since the major difference between a zoo and the wild is the absence of parasites and enemies and the abundance of food.' Moreover, `it has its own territory' and `The most dangerous animal in a zoo is Man.' <br /> <br />The miraculous survival should make the reader believe in God. God equals fortune here. The author pokes fun at the bitter religious rivalries for the soul of mankind (hiding mostly fierce power and territory struggles): `There are always those who take it upon themselves to defend God. These people fail to realize that it is on the inside that God must be defended not in the outside. They should direct their anger at themselves. For evil in the open is but evil from within that has been let out.' <br /> <br />This is certainly a very original survival story (`only fear can defeat life'). But it is rather innocent entertainment. <br /> <br />A worth-while read. <br />
B0000025JT|5.0|AS usual, Barbra is excellent! I have one concern. Some of her albums have the same songs on as on other albums.<br /><br />Other than that, you can't beat her. I wish she would come back to recording again.
B000FILW86|5.0|It's hard to believe that after 16 albums spanning a 30 year career, the band that set the blueprint for modern pop-rock is still doing it better than anyone else. Self-produced and released through the band's own Cheap Trick Unlimited label, Rockford (dubbed after the Tricksters northern IL hometown) is a near flawless contemporary classic rock album, brimming with easy going and heavy hitting rock'n'roll melodies. <br /> <br />Fresh and relevant as ever, Robin Zander and co. have crafted one of the best records of their career by doing what they do best: sticking to their guns without compromise while consistently writing the world's greatest rock and roll songs. Every track on Rockford just feels and sounds good, inside and out. The album's unapologetically cheerful verses and choruses exist in a world where life's little hardships cease to be, and contentedness can be found on a front porch beneath a starlit summer sky. <br /> <br />From the hard rock anthem Welcome to the World to the seventies-ish ballad O Claire to the groove-laden, ZZ Top inspired One More, Rockford maintains a consistent, upbeat, and undeniably catchy series of melodies from start to finish. <br /> <br />Cheap Trick are are the anti-Rolling Stones. Somehow they manage to become better and more relevant as they get older.
B000031XCR|5.0|The first time I heard Celine Dion was on the Oprah Winfrey show and I was hooked! <br /> <br />Also a beautiful voice. I thought Barbra Striesand was excellent, I still do, but Celine Dion gives her a run for her money. Her duet with Barbra Striesand was SO GOOD! Not enough adjectives to describe these two gifted singers.
B000FS9FCQ|5.0|It's not often I'm completely blown away by a new film. But at the insistance of a close friend, I watched this with him the night it came out on DVD and I was floored. I can't remember the last time I had such an emotional reaction to a film.<br /><br />Many insightful things have already been said about 'V' by other reviewers, so I will try to keep this brief for the sake of not retreading what they've already said. First, the characterization in this film is nothing short of brilliant. The script is fantastic and they chose the right actors/actresses for the right rolls. You will believe you know these characters yourself when the film is through.<br /><br />The production team pulled no punches on the visuals. Over 80 full-scale sets with minute attention to detail, beautifully realistic model-based special effects as opposed to thinly veiled CGI as is the common practice in hollywood nowadays... it's all there. Not only that, but the soundtrack is gorgeous. The orchestral themes are memorable, the use of secondary tunes appropriate and unobtrusive. The soundtrack goes so far towards moving the plot emotionally.<br /><br />Most importantly, the story is rich and multi-faceted in a way that I was not expecting. There is layer upon layer of storyline elements, points, general brainfood, call them what you will... when you add the superb (and highly emotional) character development as well as its historical allusions to November the fifth and Guy Fawkes, you get a film that is massive in scale.<br /><br />Quickly before I wrap this review up, I would like to address a few specific things. Mainly, I think anyone who complains about the slightly unfaithful adaptation of the graphic novel is missing the point and depriving themselves of some of what this film has to offer as a separate body of work. Given the medium, this adaptation is about as good as it could have been. The changes to the story do not affect the quality at all. The convoluted maze of plot details now native to the graphic novel are beyond the scope of a mere two hour roll of celluloid (not to mention some of them might have dulled the delivery of the film considerably, IE the \\"Fate\\" computer.) Personally I'm relieved they chose overall quality over 100% accuracy.<br /><br />Lastly, I am reviewing the Two-Disc Special Edition DVD because it is the edition I purchased, but it is not really necessary. The special features are interesting but are not very long and you may not find it worth the extra four bucks. I prefer the artwork though and it does come with a hilarious (although hidden) SNL skit featuring Natalie Portman.<br /><br />This movie is worth an immediate purchase. Number one of the year so far and a contender for my personal top five. It's subversive and some people may find it uncomfortable, but it is undoubtedly of the highest quality filmmaking. Completely worth your money and the time you'll spend obsessing about it after you watch it for the first time.tails now native to the graphic novel are beyond the scope of a mere two hour roll of celluloid (not to mention some of them might have dulled the delivery of the film considerably, IE the \\"Fate\\" computer.)

B000ETQRCM|5.0|Is this Ten?  No.  Accept that fact, Generation X, and move on.  See, Pearl Jam is not just about their debut.  Never have been.  I know, I know, we all want to be back in that dorm room, listening to \\"Black\\" while a certain substance is passed around, but we can't.  We've gotten older.  And so have PJ.  Pearl Jam hasn't, since the early to mid-nineties, had the huge popularity they once held at arms length with disdain as they navigated and sparred with Nirvana for the top of the grunge food chain.  Grunge, as some of us older folk recall, was the label that critics and the media used to define the hard-rocking, dirty-chord and distortion sound of bands such as Nirvana, Soundgarden, Pearl Jam, or any band out of Seattle that was signed to anything remotely resembling a record label in the early nineties.  Not that Pearl Jam were really grunge; they were always a rock band first and foremost, but \\"grunge\\" is such a stupid, made-up word anyway.  And almost as soon as tortured and troubled Nirvana front man Kurt Cobain committed suicide, grunge began to die a speedy death.  The icon and leader had taken himself down from the mantle.  And, despite the wishes of fans and the media, (listening to albums of visceral power like the triumvirate of Ten, Vs., and Vitalogy), Pearl Jam would not usurp the throne.  They wanted nothing of it; and they made it plain.  They alienated Ticketmaster, MTV, and the very media that wanted them to rise up and lead.  Nope.  Not gonna happen.  And, with the coming of the Macarena, the final nail was put into the grunge coffin.  We were left with a garden populated by the likes of the Backstreet Boys, N*SYNC, and Britney.  Not to mention a myriad of clones and imitators.  Ironically, as Pearl Jam saw their own record sales diminish, radio was inundated with a cabal of Pearl Jam wannabes, with their lead singers all imitating Eddie Vedder's low, resonating baritone.  Nickelback, Creed, Staind, anyone?  The list is filled with mediocrity.  Sadly, \\"grunge,\\" what had died too quickly to become corporatized, was now becoming a corporate product.  And what did Pearl Jam do?  They watched from the sidelines.  They experimented and branched out musically with CDs like No Code, Yield, Binaural, and Riot Act.  All good in their own right, but what band could live up to the freshman, sophomore, and junior efforts that Pearl Jam had?  And why should they care?  They had lost their relevance and success was waning.  Their time had come and gone, right?  Nope.  They've just got their wanderings out of their system.  Their self-titled eighth studio album (that's Pearl Jam, or \\"the avocado\\" CD, as it's destined to become) finds them almost unselfconsciously stumbling back into being unmistakably relevant.  And it isn't, as some like to dumb down for themselves, only about Bush and politics, it's about America as a canvas.  This is a straight-ahead rock record they haven't put out in twelve years.  The dirty, overlapping guitar work by Mike McCready and Stone Gossard is there, Jeff Ament's bass and Matt Cameron's (possibly one of the best drummers working today) tight drumming thrust each song forward as Eddie's lyrics paint a picture of an American landscape torn apart, not just by war and politics, but by fear and doubt and insecurity about the future.  We all know \\"Life Wasted\\" and World Wide Suicide.\\"  Unless you are under a rock, you've read countless opinions about those songs.  But take a song like \\"Gone.\\"  Where's the blatant political statement in that song?  There is none.  It is a simple lament from someone who feels the only way to start over is to run from what they know...the desolation of a small town.  \\"If nothing is everything, I will have it all.\\"  Taken from \\"Nothing is everything\\" from the Who's \\"Let's see action\\" and saying, \\"If that is true, then I will have everything.\\"  Or, as Janis said, \\"freedom's just another word for nothing left to lose.\\"  Better put, it's about hope.  \\"Inside Job?\\" A man proclaiming that the only faith he needs in within himself.  In fact, the only reference to any particular politics or political person is the word \\"president.\\"  Suffice to say, this is one of the few albums in the last ten years that deserves, no -  demands, to be listened to as a whole.  Do the songs handle being singles?  Sure, of course they do; but this is an album, in the real idea and tradition of what an album is and should be.  It is a collection of songs with a running theme and set of ideas.  Listen to it that way.  Pearl Jam has gone from fighting against the world to fighting for the world.  The rebellion of their famous youth now applies and speaks for the rest of the disenchanted.  They are now, in the maturity of their forties, willing to take the mantle, both (yes, to a degree) politically and musically, and bring some passion and sincerity back to the airwaves.    So let the memories of flannel and Doc Martens go, and join them in adulthood.  Heck, if anything, they put most everything on the radio to bland over-marketed shame.  And yes, they still rock.      Oh, and to one reviewer....  Buckcherry?  You got to be kidding.  Right?
006054094X|2.0|The topic addressed is this book is extremelly interesting. It is inspiring, intriguing, and fascinating. However, speculation is presented as a fact everywhere. Potential possibilities are presented as proven facts. The conclusions are thus misleading. The text is poorly written.
B000G75AE8|5.0|Nu-metal?! If your hearing new metal here stop talking. You know nothing what you speak.<br /><br />  This is SLAYER!! Plain and simple as that. If you are a true Slayer fan you will be more than happy.<br /><br />  To people saying Kerry and Jeff need music lessons: Let's hear your bands music or at least you playing guitar. Then we can talk.<br /><br />  To people bashing Slayer for their subject material I have a question. WHAT DO YOU EXPECT THEM TO WRITE ABOUT!? Is bashing religion getting old? I think not; as long as people keep trying cram their beliefs down society's kneck and tell me and other's how to live our personal lives then let there be a voice of another point of view. If it makes you uncomfortable or you don't like what the band is saying, then don't listen to Slayer. Perhaps the poppy tunes of Motley Crue are more for you.<br /><br />  Again this is SLAYER, as soon as you pop in the CD you will know who you are listening to. If you are a fan you will smile from ear to ear with satisfaction. Enjoy
B0008ENIAC|5.0|I first saw this film on Turner Classic one night a few years ago, shortly into the film as I was skimming through the channels. I saw the murder take place, and I was hooked. I watched the rest of the film, glued to the screen. To say that Joan Crawford ruled this film is a major understatement. She thouroughly dominated the screen from beginning to end. In a way, she WAS Mildred, the story drew strong parallels to her own life. Ann Blyth was PERFECT as the wanna-be rich snob Veda. Eve Arden should have had more time in this film, she was needed relief from the seriousness of the story. All three principle female leads got academy award nominations for this film, Crawford won Best Actress, and there's no arguing she deserved it. As the plot has been dissected and gone over repeatedly before, I'll focus on the DVD release. The film transferred beautifully, with razor-sharp definition and wonderful light and dark areas. This film is true film noir, and the lighting played a major role in the movie. On the disc flip side, there is a wonderful documentary on Crawford's life called \\"Joan Crawford: The Ultimate Movie Star\\". The documentary is well-worth watching on its own, so to have it included is great. All in all, it's easy to see why Crawford was very proud of this film, it represented her commercial comeback after MGM put her out to pasture, saying she was too old, and box office poison. Amazing what the right role, script, and director can do for a strong actor. This film is a true classic, so get this DVD and enjoy!

B000F7CMRM|4.0|George Clooney and Matt Damon would be enough reason for me to see this movie.  I think they're both truly fine actors, and I always take great pleasure in watching them work.  Even though they don't interact directly in this film, their presences and performances add brilliant facets to a gem that's far from a mere bauble.<br /><br />This film wants several consecutive viewings, especially if the viewer tends to blink often, but that may be a strong argument for seeing it the first time.  There is much afoot, and none of it appears connected ... until ...
B00007M5CO|4.0|this is a great CD -- i would rate it 4.5 stars.  i was expecting more upbeat songs like track #2, but it is a great CD to lounge with. <br /> <br />the beats are awesome, and very well put together tracks.
B00003Q43A|4.0|Some films are important because they are original & imaginative. Others are important as they epitomize a culture, an era, etc.  I remember Bob Dole liked this one.  Alien space ships hover. Those stoopid flower children actually try to greet them on the roof.  BLAM!! Ha Ha Ha. Every red state housewife with her apron on would say, \\"Of course aliens would kill us & get what we have to take to their own families!\\" Foreigners! I visualize the American Gothic couple - they hear footsteps approaching - they blast their rifle into the fog.
B000HCO840|4.0|After the undeniable success of X-Men and X-Men: X-Men United, this third movie about the famous mutants, brought all kind of reactions from the hardcore fans to the not so die-hard fans.<br /><br />Director Brett Rattner had very big shoes to fill, becaue Bryan Singer had done so much for X-Men. He gave all of us, a credible movie. He showed that comic-based movies can be movies with meaning and depth, and certainly not cartoon like. Rattner did an acceptable job in my opinion.<br /><br />In this movie we get action as never before in the previous movies, though we lose character content. We have quite a large number of mutants to introduce, along with the already known ones, so it is much more difficult to really build up the character's psychology.<br /><br />The most important part of the movie falls in the hands of Hugh Jackman (Wolverine), Sir Ian McKellen (Magneto) and Famke Janssen (Jean Grey / Dark Phoenix). The rest of the chracaters, Iceman, Mystique, Rogue, Storm, Colossus, etc are quite shadowed.<br /><br />I cannot say I was completely satisfied with The Last Stand, though I recognize it is a very good movie. But definitely I enjoy more X-Men and X-Men 2. Nonetheless, I can't miss having this DVD in my collection.
6304698526|4.0|I rented this movie recently, (I was the only person in 1968 who didn't see it), I was blown away by Steve McQueen's good looks and sharp blue eyes.  Yum!  The movie itself was cop/bad guys drama, excellent car chase!   Honestly, this movie looks like it could have been filmed in the early 90's.  The DVD transfer was crystal clear.  Well done, enjoy!
B000GFLKF8|1.0|Terrible movie. The actors are pretty good but they are just wandering around an incoherent mess of a movie. This film goes nowhere, and is very unsatisfying. Plus, they give away the ending in a way that spoils the movie without adding anything at all. And this is really bad because there isn't a whole lot going on in the first place. <br /> <br />Total waste of time. If you are bored enough to watch this you should probably find some new hobbies.
1559408898|5.0|I usually don't care for this type of movie, and as the sequels went on and on it got worse.  But, I really liked this one a lot, the original is always the best.  Anyway, excellent storyline, very different for the time and holds up well, even with todays CGI audiences.  Enjoy!
B000G75AE8|5.0|In a move almost no one expected, Slayer has released arguably the best metal record of 2006 in Christ Illusion. There is going to be a lot of people who will hear the VERY recognizable elements of Slayer on this and will quickly dismiss this as more \\"same old, same old\\", and in doing so will miss out on what is the best songwriting package Slayer has delivered since \\"Seasons In The Abyss\\" 16 years ago.    This record is the prototypical modern era Slayer record. It has all of the elements that make Slayer, well, Slayer.. the speed, the thrash, the aggression. However, Slayer's core sound has continually expanded as they evolve with the metal scene. There are some black metal influences here, some Nile-like guitar riffing, even some metalcore influences in the heavy double bass beat patterns all over the record. Still, Slayer makes all of these elements their own and successfully incorporates them into their own style - without comprising anything that makes Slayer Slayer. The most important element here is the songwriting.    A key factor is the return of original drummer Dave Lombardo. Since Dave left, he has continued to grow and evolve as a drummer in the many projects he was involved in, and this diversity and experience really comes through here. Dave delivers, in my opinion, his most inspiring and interesting drum performance on Christ Illusion. Paul Bostaph, most agree, is a better pure technical metal drummer. A true machine. Lombardo's style however is KEY to Slayer's sound and his return highlights that. Has his feet ever sounded faster than on \\"Supremist\\"? Is that an actual blastbeat I hear? YES!    This is the first record since Seasons in which I can honestly say that I like every track. The previous few Slayer records \\"God Hates Us All\\", \\"Diabolus in Musica\\" and \\"Divine Intervention\\" all had their good moments and their forgettable moments. Christ Illusion is really a strong record as a whole without any glowing weaknesses.    If there is a weaker track, for me its probably, ironically, the much hyped lead track \\"Cult\\". This has more to do with the over-the-top lyrical content. It's not that I'm offended in the least, it just comes across so overtly as to approach parody. Jesus Christ this Jesus Christ that, \\"I've made my choice! 666!\\". I just feel it detracts slightly from the song. A great song to scare the parents with though.    A note on Slayer lyrical content: Art has a responsibility for each age to document things that don't go into a history book. People's fears, their desires, the mood of the times, the lifestyle, the beliefs, the ugliness, the beauty. This is reflected through song, through sculpture, through paintings, through books. Slayer is a reflection of the darkness of modern society. Violence, warfare, destruction, murder, corruption, genocide, betrayal, slavery, control, fear, punishment, religion. Whether it's recounting the horrors of the Jewish holocaust in \\"Angel of Death\\" or viewing the 9/11 event through the eyes of a terrorist on \\"Jihad\\", Slayer touch upon the dark realities of life that people don't like to think about. They do this without glorifying, without judgment or even condemnation - they merely reflect what \\"Is\\", music being their canvas. If the world ever ends, Slayer will play the soundtrack. Having said that, sometimes Slayer try a bit too hard to be \\"Satanic\\". While no one in the band is a Satanist (vocalist Araya is in fact a practicing Catholic), the lyrics are just Kerry King's way of rejecting organized religion (King writes most Slayer lyrics and music), it can still become near comical if it's used too much. An example is \\"Cult\\". A minor point.     While I genuinely enjoy every song on the record, a few highlights:    \\"Flesh Storm\\" - A great Slayer album opener. Very catchy chorus, the break down near the end has a heavy groove and is classic Slayer.    \\"Jihad\\" - definitely one of Slayer's most controversial songs, lyrically, and musically one of their most unique.Doesn't sound like any other Slayer song and shows off impressive tempo changes and dynamic shifts. Really creepy monologue delivered by Araya at the end.    \\"Skeleton Christ\\" - a medium tempo crushing song. A song that wouldn't seem too out of place on a Chimaira record. Heavy, pounding, mid tempo behemoth of a song. Great Chorus.    \\"Supremist\\" - could be Slayer's fastest song. A true blazer, heavy and relentless. The slow ending with Araya reciting \\"Must maintain control of the weak / must contain the minds of the free\\" is a picture perfect example of a Slayer moment to send a shiver down your spine.    Slayer has returned, and in returning they have ascended back to their throne, and retaken their dominion over all that is metal.

The reason why it takes so long time not to get anything, must be the reason why so many people are dazzeled about his naivite, simplicity and understanding of life. Read this book if you are not fond of reading, it might proppell your reading skills enough to read books worth reading, but often more cumbersome. Or read it if you are into the \\"alternative way\\" of life. Eg. its good to be good , it's bad to be sad.
B0000029AP|5.0|Toys in the Attic was Aerosmith's breakthrough album and one of my absolute favorites. I won't call this album flawless because it isn't but it is a great listen for anyone. This album spawned the hits \\"Walk This Way\\" and \\"Sweet Emotion\\" that turned the band into superstars. You can tell by listening to this album that it is before the drugs had become the priority over the music. It is hard blues-based rock at it's best. <br /> <br />Toys In The Attic- 8/10 great opener <br />Uncle Salty- 5/10 to me the weakest track on the album, it's not without it's charm but doesn't hold up well to the other songs. <br />Adam's Apple- 6/10 love at first bite <br />Walk This Way- 10/10 a classic Aerosmith staple <br />Big Ten Inch- 8/10 a song I'm very partial to, a humorous bluesy cover <br />Sweet Emotion- 10/10 another classic staple, though in my opinion not quite as good as Walk This Way, it still deserves a 10 <br />No More No More- 9.5/10 great riff, chorus, this is an extremely underrated song <br />Round And Round- 8.5/10 this is the heaviest song on the album <br />You See Me Crying- 9/10 this ballad is a nice touch to close off the album, he does a lyric in a scream voice which adds a lot to the song. It does run a little long but all in all it's great. <br /> <br />Toys In The Attic is a must-have. Check out my review on Aerosmith's Rocks. The album that rivals this one.
0375701427|3.0|It's a challenge to know how to rate this novel.  As a work of literature, it's superb - Roth's prose is mesmeric as always and the exposition of a man's mental anguish feels convincing and haunting.  As a novel I read for entertainment, I found it less satisfying, to the extent that I couldn't finish it.   <br /> <br />As Roth as Zuckerman imagines his way inside the Swede's head, the reader spends the majority of the book looking at the world through the Swede's eyes.  Just as the Swede is compelled to revisit time and time again the events that led up to Merry's devastating actions and the subsequent years, so the reader is compelled to share his mental anguish.  Whilst this is powerfully and restrainedly told, it does not make for an easy read emotionally.
B000G75AE8|1.0|This New release is just plain garbage...I agree with you Corpsegrinder. <br /> <br />As a die-hard Slayer fan..The band did die after Seasons..

Everytime I watch it, I hear or see something new. <br />The plots in all three stories are very simple, maybe even thin. But it's not the story that's the masterpiece here, it's the way the story is told.  <br />Ofcourse it's violent, we are talking about Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino afterall, but it delivers. Totally. <br />Buy this dvd, it will continue to entertain you for years.

B000EMGJM2|5.0|Never heard of VH until I saw him back up the Brand New Heavies last month in chicago. From his first appearance onstage with a funky 70's outfit and groove, he was in complete control. The energy that night was amazing and I talked to several people afterward that said they thought his performance was the highlight of the night. After the show he walked through the crowd and chatted with the fans. He just strolled by and I got to shake his hand. Very cool. Well I ordered the CD and have been listening to it ever since. Van Hunt is the real deal and has so much to offer as a singer/songwriter/musician. I hate to compare him to anybody, but during the show I was thinking Curtis Mayfield, Isley Bros. and Prince. The CD is diverse and takes several listens to fully digest. Each time I listen a different cut stands out. Can't wait to hear more from Van Hunt.
B000F3AAUW|5.0|2006 has been a crazy year for music (no pun intended). As opposed to 2005, when there was tons of new music to sample from, 2006 has been characterized mostly by mainstream and already established artists coming back and releasing their first album in X many years. One of the most notable exceptions to this trend has been the debut album of Gnarls Barkley.<br /><br />If you feel the album sounds like Outkast going out for drinks with Gorillaz with a touch of soul and a tad of extra funk, it may be because at its core, \\"St. Elsewhere\\" is the combination of Danger Mouse's music and Cee-Lo's words. The product is a contagious album where \\"Crazy\\" has barely been the lead track to flood the airwaves of America. Along with MF Doom's work, without a doubt this is where some of the most interesting fusion hip-hop can be heard these days.
B000058983|5.0|I loved Forever Changes forty years ago.  Even though it was a little complex for the time.  Recently after buying the CD I played it for my young daughter (21 years old) as an experiment.  I wanted to see her reaction since I knew she had never heard it before.  It blew her away, she said \\"did you listen to that when you were young?\\"  I had to give her my CD to take back to college and I ordered another from Amazon.  Arthur Lee, brilliant. Forever Changes, timeless and compex.  I detect its influence on artists of today.  (Paul Simon for example)  Forever Changes, even has a Rap song.  First Rap song ever? Possible.  Arthur Lee died recently.  God Bless you man!
B000GI3KHQ|5.0|This is more of a review of the DVD than the movie.  As indicated in other reviews, the movie is wonderful and I rate it five stars.<br /><br />The DVD is as basic as it could be.  There are no special features or included material other than the DVD.  The movie looks like it was copied off of an old film real with various streaks and imperfections.  I don't know if the original movie was wide screen, but the DVD is formatted to fit a square TV.<br /><br />It was a long wait to see this on DVD and it is a shame that more wasn't put into the DVD.  Having said that, it was a joy to watch this movie.  God bless Captain Vere.
B000G03RJA|4.0|This is the best branigan collection issued so far. <br />All the hits and the fundamental album tracks (why silent partners instead of heart?!?!) are here and with the remastering they truly have a new life. <br />Still, some songs are missing: <br />for instance Maybe Tonight (from Hold Me) and Cry Wolf (from Touch) were both commercial singles and had videos and together with Hold Me and a couple of tracks from over my heart they deserved inclusion on the collection. <br />But overall this is the best you get, until rhino will decide to put a 2 disc collection (maybe in their wonderful \\"Gold\\" series) with all the singles plus the new songs. Who knows....
B00008PC2O|5.0|When this film was released it blew people away. Without this film and its revolutionary use of CGI, Lord of the Rings et al may never have happened. But it isn't just the effects, it's the story. Cameron excelled with his script here. Not only is there thrills from start to finish, but there is tenderness, thought-provoking vision, and, at the risk of alienating a whole demographic of viewers, social commentary. Everyone who wants to write a movie script should study this film, then we might not be inundated with contrived drivel year after year. It must be getting on for 20 years old now, but you'd never think it. It could have been released yesterday - the sign of a truly great film.
1878424319|1.0|I read this book in one day. It's only 138 pages long, but it could be a lot shorter. The titles of the four agreements (which I'm sure appear elsewhere on this page, so I'll spare you the tedium of reading them again) are pretty much all you need to know. The author elaborates on them in a tone that tries really hard to sound wise, but actually makes him sound phoney.<br /><br />His arguments are not internally consistant. He starts out by saying that we're all exactly what society and our parents wanted us to be, no more no less. You should forgive anyone who's wronged you (good advice) because they're also exactly what society and their parents wanted them to be, so they really couldn't help but wrong you (which completely allieviates everyone in the entire world who ever existed of any responsilibity for anything they ever did, good or bad). But!, he goes on to say, you can change what you are (responsibility exists again!). Although this is true, it completely obliterates his case for forgiveness. If I can change, then why can't the person who wronged me?<br /><br />Even if that made sense, the author's insistence that the reader can't possibly be anything other than what society wanted them to be makes a huge and fairly insulting assumption about them. Agreement three is \\"Don't make assumptions\\".<br /><br />Agreement two basically informs you that people react to their own issues. You can't do anything to make them mad or happy. Although it's probably true enough to apply to your day to day life, it falls apart when taken to extreme cases: If someone stabbed me, I would get angry. By this logic, my anger is not caused by anything the stabber did, but by my own ideas about the world (such as the idea that no one has the right to stab me, and yet I have been stabbed).<br /><br />Crux of the book: Don't put energy into things you don't absolutely, truly believe in. You'll screw up occasionally, but that's ok, because you did your best (as per agreement four - which he totally needed to tell me. I was going around striving for mediocrity. Sure glad he clued me in!) Don't lose sleep over people's reactions to you, because it's their action, not yours. If you want that argument expanded to fill 138 pages, you might like this book. I did not.
B00006F1IJ|5.0|Absolutely love this CD, it has all my favorites from this magnificent duo. They explore many different styles of music while maintaining their identity within the acoustic jazz genre.
B000FS9FCQ|5.0|Any movie with Jan van Eyck's Arnofini Marriage in it has an A in my book, but this film is a truly awe-inspiring combination of creative plot, great casting/characters, and phenomenal special effects.  Very moving yet funny and real.  Watching it puts you in the action and gets your pulse AND your brain going.  The best movie I've seen in years.
B00001SIES|3.0|First of all, I would like to discount any ideas that Muse are a \\"boy band,\\" that is one of the most inncorrect statements I have ever heard. They are noted for their brilliant live preformences.  They are my favorite band, but I do have to bash a little on this album because it their worst. And any idiot that says you have to like all of a band's albums to be a fan is also very stupid.    After the first couple of listens, I was a little too critical of this album because compared to their other albums it was inferior.  This album really shows the true youth of Muse at this point in their career.  It is more emotional and takes a lot from Radiohead. It is amazing to see how much Muse has evolved since this first album.
B00000IL29|5.0|I think Herbie Hancock has been the one of most influential men in jazz scene after Miles. <br /> <br />His music is very variable just like 'Chameleon' one of his hit tracks in another album 'Head Hunter' <br /> <br />May be, you think about the Herbie's Music that is Fusion & Electric Sound. Or his careers with Miles and many more Musicians in the mainstream Jazz. <br /> <br />But Herbie's music is Herbie Hancock himself! <br />It is a Chameleon 'who' can change his colors easily on surrounded environment. <br /> <br />Herbie's music colors were the same things chameleon's  <br /> <br />He has taught us his amazing abilities that were most becoming to all of jazz Genre through many marvelous album & music. <br /> <br />this record Maiden Voyage is also qualified as something else. <br /> <br />The album Genre was called Modal Jazz.  <br />The song - same name of album title - the 1st track \\"Maiden Voyage\\" was typical of Modal Theory. <br /> <br />Just like many men loving Jazz, I don't know Jazz Theory well either. <br /> <br />But a true attraction of this piece is a beautiful melody. <br /> <br />For example, the first and the last track, \\"Maiden Voyage\\" and \\"Dolphin Dance\\" have been most perfomed jazz standard. <br /> <br />Sometimes, Because of its beautiful Melodies this record is more relaxant & easy to appreciate rather than hard bop or funky jazz, etc...  <br /> <br />Though you are not hard Jazz Cat, this \\"Maiden Voyage\\" can bring a great inspiration to you. <br /> <br />If you begin a hearing this music, you might be under a delusion about that you are in a Quiet Sea. <br /> <br />This is a Great & most beautiful album. <br /> <br />Don't hesitate to buy something else.
630522885X|2.0|Okay, it's not that bad, but I've been trying to upgrade the review titles lately and couldn't resist.  Anyway, LOLA MONTES might carry the high cachet of a master's masterpiece, but I could barely keep my eyes on this story of the grand courtesan of Europe, Lola Montes, who left Liszt, loved King Ludwig, and wound up in the middle of a circus with Peter Ustinov wearing the tall silk and cracking a whip, the audience shouting out indelicate questions, and her life being replayed in a series of flashbacks.  The lovely Lola, played by the monotonous Martine Carol, may have led a fascinating and compelling life, but it failed to generate a spark with me.<br /><br /> The thing does look good though, as far as I could tell.  Nice framing, editing, layers of action, that kind of stuff.  When this Fox/Lorber dvd wasn't showing off its scratches and flares it was fluttering across the screen.  Even with a pristine print and a perfect transfer, though, I don't think I'd care to sit through this one again.
B0002IU988|5.0|first off i think creeed was really lacking in vocals their best song my own prison has the chorus sung entirely by tremonti <br /> <br />now to ab: <br />a great band plenty of guitar solos which most guitarists like disturbed and system would never be able to pull off myles voice definitely is better than the baritone idiot known as stapp kennedy has more of a cutting edge feel to the music and i think the ohhhhhhh in myles voice in most the songs is instrumental i enjoy it i mentioned the guitar solos great but is complented with kennedy rhythmn guitars now enough about myles and tremonti <br />phillips drums are definitely underated and hold the band together during meatalingus marshall is the most undrerated bassist of all time ab would not be so good without him my favorite song is watch your words the lyrics are incredible and for everyone who say ab is not christian than explain the line\\"to truly see well you must have faith saving grace that all we know let us pray let us hold on\\" my second favorite is buirn it down a slow song which i didnt like at first but it grows on you the only complaint is the chorus tremontis backing vocals are out of line with myles i think the entire chorus should be sang by mark yes mark he is an incredibly talented and underated vocalist as for the cd only complaint myles doesnt play enough guitar and tremonti doesnt sing enough i hope the next album will have more team work overall the third best band in the world below nickelback whom is number one and nirvana
B000BB1MI2|5.0|I think this movie was the best! And this is coming from a kid who loves Johnny Depp. I really like this movie...but he is much hotter in the Pirates of the Caribbean movies...but hes still awesome!I think he did an awesome job playing Willy Wonka. Oh...and who ever said that his teeth look fake???there MUST be something wrong with you! Well anyways i think he looks awesome! <br />
B0009I7NNA|1.0|[...]The singer tries to sound \\"power metal\\", but ends up sounding like he has a cold(for a good nasal singer, listen to any of Mike Patton's bands). The guitarists still play repetitive riffs, but now they have \\"borrowed\\" solos from better guitarists like Slash or the late Dimebag Darrel. The bass is still undetectable, and the drumming is generic. Don't be fooled into thinking this is metal!
B000G75AE8|4.0|Christ Illusion sounds a bit cool for a new title album for Slayer. All the songs sound great, because of Kerry's and Jeff's guitar parts. The most outstanding song of all is Jihad. It may not be another Reign in Blood, but its worth listening to.
B000G75AE8|5.0|Nu-Metal doesn't have blazing riffs, blistering solos, and killer drumbeats, now does it? Slayer slipped up starting on \\"Diabolus In Musica\\", but now they have put out Christ Illusion, which is a throwback to the good ol' days of Reign in Blood and Seasons in the Abyss. Other than that, my opinion has already been said. This is an awesome album. Now we wait for United Abominations by Megadeth...
B0000AQS0F|5.0|i don't understand why it was cancelled. this show has so much potential! i'm glad amazon is selling the dvd for $25 though. i immediately got my copy when i saw this awesome price =)
B000002JSJ|5.0|I'm happy you sent me a review deliver from this cd<br /><br />thank you<br /><br />Lucin
B000000OU0|4.0|I was a little disappointed because there were two songs that I was expecting to be on this CD and they weren't. I was hoping to see Hole in the World and One Day at a Time instead of some old songs on this cd.
B000F3AAUW|5.0|The best part of this album is that it is different. Really and truly different.  Each song is an individual.  That is not to say that the cd is not cohecive since the album plays through well, however, each song is a surprise.  I bought this cd having only heard the song crazy, which I instantly loved.  I found that this was not, in fact, my favorite song on the cd.  I loved the tracks transformer, smiley faces, and the boogie monster as much or more then the song I bought the disk for.  If you like to listen to different and ecclectic music this is a great cd for you.
0385336691|5.0|Hurrah for lee child and another GREAT page-turner!! thank goodness he hasn't run out of ideas or gone stale like some of my other favorites have!
B000G75AE8|5.0|I went to Ozzfest this year (2006) and I was so disappointed by most of the bands.  I was beginning to feel like everything I had known and loved in metal had died, stomped by nu-metal emo bands and their wacky fans who do flashdance like spin kicks and spazz out in their silly pits.  And then along comes this CD and my faith in metal is renewed.  This is Slayer, back in form, doing what they do best.  I feel this is their best CD since Seasons in the Abyss.  I didn't like Divine Intervention, though I do really like Diabolus.  GHUA is ok, and far better than DI... but this CD is definitely a return to form.  Now if only they could kick some of those bands off Ozzfest and reclaim the stage...
B000HBK3MM|4.0|I like this album and think you will too.<br /><br />Buy it.
B00002E23E|5.0|Can someone say \\"Jimmy Page is a Guitar God\\"? Sure, I knew you could. Even now, with both Page and Plant getting on in years, there is still something 'there' when they merge together. Just listen to their No Quarter versions of old Zep material and their own material: \\"Wonderful One\\" and \\"The Truth Explodes\\", as well as the stuff they wrote with some Moroccan musicians: \\"City Don't Cry\\" and the \\"Wha Wha\\" song.  Tell me there isn't still Page/Plant magick going on within the realm of their music. Some slam \\"Walking Into Clarksdale\\" Page/Plant's project from 1998, but even though I think some of those songs could have had a bit more edge to them, I still enjoy many of the finished products like: \\"Most High\\" \\"Shining Light\\" \\"When The World Was Young\\"-a song, which I believe Robert is speaking about him and Jimmy-and \\"House Of Love\\", the magick remains the same.  (If the two men can just come to some agreement and continue being who they are, I honestly don't think their fans would complain.) I am enjoying my DVD of \\"The Song Remains The Same\\" (haven't seen it since I was a teenager and even then I was seeing it at a Midnight show on Friday's and Saturday's before the God machine of church \\"saved\\" me from my 'sinning' ways and I let go of the one band that I fell in love with at first sight.) And I do mean fell in love with. It wasn't just Jimmy and Robert's physical appearance, although that was nothing to sneer at, it was their amazing confidence when they fell into their music, their sheer charisma with both voice and guitar. John Bonahm, may he rest in peace, was also something of a marvel I'm discovering now in this second go round. I listen to him play on the recordings and his drumming was as smooth as silk, and in concert, he knew how to listen to the lead men and fall into step. John Paul Jones, the quiet one of the quartet, I look at him now and see how amazing he was on stage, being calm, reserved and simply allowing himself to flow with the energy around him from the music created. (Just ignore the wigs, if you can.  The pageboy look just was not him!) Everything about this band was and will continue to be a study in the complexity of confidence and being one with each other as well as one within themselves on an individual level. I noticed right off that all musicians on stage trusted each other to do their part.  There was no one out of 'place'; each had their job to do and the others made space for the individual auras to do their thing.  Jimmy and Robert may have been the 'front men' and  with their flare for charisma they fit that role well. Jonesy and Bonzo were content to stay in the background, offering their strong and smooth backup.  Jimmy's guitar playing is the stuff of legend, and Robert was once quoted as saying that he, \\"Plays a little left of heaven.\\"  Perfect analogy. Jimmy is always in a world of his own making, making him a one-of-a-kind guitarist.  Jimmy loses himself in his music and its very evident on camera.  He knows he's being filmed but doesn't seek the camera out, he lets his music take him where he wills and where he wills to play is to the audience.  The members of the band did not think these nights of concerts were their best...not their worst, but not their best.  I beg to differ.  From a viewer who had never even heard of Zeppelin before seeing this movie (with the exception that they did this song called 'Stairway To Heaven'), I was floored from the first moment I laid eyes (and ears) on what they could do. It's been 30 years since The Song Remains The Same movie was released, and it's still as fresh to me each time I see it as though it were brand new. <br />~White Ravyn~
B000FS9FCG|3.0|The movie could not capture the emotion in the comic, and it rewrote many parts of the story...those stupid brothers.<br /><br />However, the film was quite good, if it weren't for the fact it was supposed to be based off of something as good as the book.
0070511136|5.0|A very good and interesting book and very easy to read. For me this book was very convincing for 2 important reasons: 1. SPIN selling is based upon scientific research of many sales calls for many years. 2. The idea of SPIN selling is about the fact that customers decide whether they buy somehting (or advance the sales call) upon their own ideas, their own beliefs, their own assumptions.  <br /> <br />Neil Reckham offers you a guidline to find out what the assumptions and beliefs of a customer are by using SPIN questions. If you're the one who asks the questions in a salescall, you're in control of the conversation. Basically SPIN selling teaches you how to figure out what customers really need, and how you can emphasize this need so that customers believe that your product or service is worth the money. All of this is done by guiding the conversation in the direction YOU want, just by asking the right kind of questions. <br /> <br />These question-techniques are not just applicable for sales-people. There are many other situations where you want to get things done from people, and SPIN selling really helps you get it done! <br /> <br />I therefor recommend this book not just to salespeople, but in general to people who want to learn how to get things done just by asking the right questions
B00005JOML|2.0|After all of the hype, I did see Miami Vice after work last night, and I have mixed feelings about it. Now, I'm not going to disuade you   from seeing it. However, if you do see it, wait for the DVD, but don't get your hopes up too much. Like the other reviews here, there was just so much missing, and it could have been a great film had more of the minute details been attended to.     There also seemed to be no chemistry between Farrell and Foxx, and if Colin would have projected more energy into his role instead of just trying to be cool, it would have made a slight difference in my opinion.     I also feel not enough of Miami, it's beautiful colors, vibrant people and other aspects of Miami/South Florida life were not shown as in the original TV series. In fact, most of the movie did not even take place in Miami, and to tell you the truth it   could have been filmed in \\"any city\\" USA. I also wish more   familiar characters would have been   included, such as Lt. Castillo and others from the show. And for   heaven's sake, they did not even play the \\"Miami Vice\\" theme!    I will admit though, there were some great action scenes, especially near the end, and Mann, who is still one of the greatest directors around injected some gritty camera work into the movie.  However, I think this was one of his not so great works, and no disrespect towards him whatsoever. Also, as one reveiwer eloquently stated, the middle was sagging with nothing to fill it.     Sadly, I and a few other members in the audience were getting restless and wondering when the movie would end. Frankly, MV was nothing more than a glorified porn flick with drugs, lots of guns and fast cars. Heck, Bad Boys 2 had more substance and action than this film.  Maybe I expected too much from MV, but overall, it was just Ok.
0394800389|4.0|When we first bought this book for my then two-year old daughter, I could barely get through it the first time.  I didn't much like it.  That's probably because I was so busy trying to say the words it, I couldn't pay attention to what was actually happening.  Since then, the book has grown on me, and my now three-year old daughter loves it, as well.  After reading the book aloud a gazillion times, I can now say it almost without getting my tongue twisted, and my favorite part is the ending, where Knox finally gets his \\"revenge\\" for what Fox has put him through. <br /> <br />One minor complaint:  Seuss uses the word \\"dumb,\\" a word I would prefer to keep out of my daughter's vocabulary, and it could easily have been replaced with \\"glum,\\" a change I try to institute when I read the book.
B000FSME1A|3.0|The fact that when AN Redux came out in 2.35:1 in the Theatre <br />and the dvd(the first redux dvd)was still  cropped  <br />made the feature less dvd somewhat  of a let down. <br />Now we get The Complete Dossier which is hardly complete, <br /> Again we get cropped versions!!!!!, <br />The Extras and price make this set a great value,but I would <br />pay twice the price ,just to see the uncropped image I remember <br />from seeing the film many times in the theatre(Both in 2.2:1  <br />and 2.35:1) <br />not only are we missing people and things from the sides of the <br />frame ,we lose much of the nice compostions , <br />This is much more important than the fact that \\"Heart of Darkness\\" <br />which did come out on laser is not in this set,there is no 2.35:1(or 2.2:1) version of this classic film,Maybe the next version? <br />
B00008OE4W|4.0|Robert Redford, Sidney Poitier, River Phoenix, Dan Ackroyd - you can't go wrong!  And this film doesn't!  It's funny and smart filled with great one-liners.  Just thinking of Dan Ackroyd as the paranoid conspiracy theorist makes me smile.  It's lots of fun for both men & women, that's why I got a copy for myself and a copy for my dad.  Put on your comfy slippers and enjoy \\"Sneakers.\\"
B000002KGT|4.0|A great album for anyone and eveyone, which truly captures the essence of not only the 70's but Fleetwood Mac itself falling apart at the seems. Great songs such as \\"Go Your Own Way\\" and \\"The Chain\\" make this a must for any record collection!
B000001FDQ|5.0|This album is undoubtably Yngwie Malmsteen's finest. Though I don't really like most of his other albums, I have to say that this one is an absolute classic. While after this album, all his solos sound the same, and his songs turned user friendly, here he was young, raw, and full of creativeness. The other thing I like about this particular album is that it is mostly instrumental. Rather than writing corny lyrics for the sake of it, his guitar does the singing, playing at light speed, while always maintaining a sense of melody. There are 2 songs with singing, but it is minimal, so in the context of the whole album it is not too bad. The other musicians on this one also do an excellent job, pulling all the songs together brilliantly. Standout songs in my opinion are: 'Far Beyond the Sun', 'Evil Eye', 'Icarus Dream Suite Op1' and 'Little Savage'. Just about any shred guitarist would have to name this album among those that have inspired them over the years, so if you're looking to get into Malmsteen, then don't bother with the rest of his albums, go straight to where he started and get this album. You won't regret it.
B000ANVQ0K|5.0|First off Titanic won 11 acadamy awards and should have won 12 but I'm sure Hollywood jealousy had something to do with it. Hollywoods golden boy, Steven Speilberg did'nt even show up at the Oscars in Mar. 1998 to represent his picture 1997s Amestad. Jealousy probably? Any negative reviews for this movie are just plain jealousy. Especially from our beloved Hollywood bigwigs. From Steven Spielberg to William Friedken all the way down the bigwig directors list all have negative comments about Titanic (1997). Jealousy run rampid, because none of these bigwig directors could have made a film like Titanic. I do recall when Titanics release date was pushed back in June 1997 to Dec.19th 1997. The budget for Titanic was going over $200,000,000, all of Hollywoods bigwig directors and producers were laughing their arses off preying for James Cameron to fall on his face and sink to the bottom of the Hollywood depths with his version of Titanic. The amazing thing about Camerons Titanic is that  from Dec.19, 1997 to Jan.2,1998 the movie only made about or just over $30,000,000 in the USA, reciepts at the box office were low Paramount, 20th Century Fox were very unhappy and wanted Camerons head on a silver platter. Then amazingly word of mouth to ears about Titanic were spoken among the American public, from that point on Titanic 1997 went on to make domestically over $600,000,000 in the USA and a mind boggling $1.8 billion dollars world wide, that is only movie reciepts not merchandise including vhs or dvd release. God only knows with this dvd special edition release Titanic could gross over $2 billion. Spielberg and Friedken have amazing cinema achievments I take nothing away from their work in cinema. Yeah! I know the ticket prices are much higher than when \\"Gone With the Wind\\" came out in 1939 surly if the ticket prices were at 1997 prices in 1939 \\"Gone With The Wind\\" would have earned alot more than Titanic 1997. Yeah right!!!!!! and I can buy Bill Gates out to! \\" Gone WithThe wind \\" is a masterpiece dont get me wrong it is one of my all time favorites. God forbid if a maverick director like James Cameron could make a movie worthy of \\"Gone With The Wind\\". If Speilberg or Friedken or any other bigwig director made Titanic 1997 it would be considered the greatest movie ever made surpassing even \\"Citizen Kane\\". Main charachters Jack and Rose were only a guide to take you the viewer aboard the Titanic. Decaprio was not oscar material but his part as Jack Dawson was played smoothly and realistic forgive Leo if he did not have the looks of a young Tony Curtis, that was not Camerons point in the Jack Dawson charachter. Kate Winslet was splendid as Rose and took talent to speak American in the movie. The real acting credit should have went to Billy Zane as Cal Hockley. Billy was incredible and recieved no mention of any awards at all at the Oscars. Billy did not even attend from what I recall in March 1998. I saw an interview with a bald Billy Zane outside the oscars after they were concluded, Billy knew he would'nt get any awards an chose to skip the oscars. This movie is as close as you could get to authentically reproducing the real events that night in April 1912 with the help of Titanic historians and experts Don Lynch and Ken Marshall. Years from now people will laugh at the love story of Titanic 1997, but Camerons film depicting the events on April 15th 1912 will be watched as the most historic and accurate depiction of that fateful night ever in any movie of Titanic made before or after Camerons version. Each actor(s)playing Captain E.J. Smith to Thomas Andrews the ships desighner to John Jacob Astor to Iwan Murdoch, to Margaret Brown to Lady Duff Gordon to Sir Cosmo were picked to look like the real people aboard the Titanic. Camereon spared no expense for his epic. Cameron had to have the finest effects the biggest budget, the biggest stage set ever created for a motion picture. Many Hollywood bigwig directors Speilberg, Friedken all the way down the list, critized Cameron for his absorbanent needs, hoping James and Titanic would flop. Not!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! the truth be known none of these bigwig bozos could have accomplished what Cameron did with all these lavish resources Cameron had. All or most of the Hollywood bigwig director bozos could not even conceive how Cameron let alone a human being with great directing skills accomplish the awesome, staggering completion of the Titanic 1997 production. How the hell did this  James Cameron, film 12,500 feet under the Atlantic ocean in a mini sub, oh by the way James did use the real Titanic, yeah! The real Titanic! Not a model. Let these Hollywood bigwig directing bozos Spielberg, Friedken etc. go to the bottom of a 12,500 foot ocean and direct a massive piece of rust, not happening!!!!!!!!!!. None of these director bozos have the skill and know how to do what Cameron did with Titanic. Believe me I am sure with all the jealousy from our great Hollywood directors and producers they to this day are shocked and amazed how the hell Cameron pulled this mind boggling production off and be the highest grossing film of all time sorry George Lucas, you brought me alot of joy with the Star Wars saga but the force is not with you or the rest of Hollywoods fine directors, except for James Cameron. You the reader of this review from movie goer to film student to director, sit back back and watch the Fox special \\"Breaking New Ground\\" on this dvd set and realize what Cameron accomplished with Titanic. \\"Believe me the Hollywood bigwigs have\\"!!. I saw an interview with Linda Hamilton, Camerons old flame, a few years back and stated that James got a big head after the success of Titanic, this was after they broke off their relationship. You know what I say to that \\" no one should show off any achievment, but Cameron deserved to have a big head on his success. Ignore all the nay sayers of Titanic 1997, they are all jealous or just dont care for the story. Enjoythis beautiful high definition film transfer to dvd, Titanic 1997 finally gets the treatment it desreves. It is a must have for movie goers to film students to directors\\" James Cameron sent Hollywood and the public a message, and I will leave it at that. James Cameron is an albertross in Hollywood..........Way to go James, you showed them All!!!!!!!!!!!!!!PS. James Cameron is mulling rereleasing Titanic 1997 in 3d!!!!!!!
B000BTC5LW|5.0|Yes, the DVD was delayed for ever, the content itself might have flaws or one could argue it is not even widescreen format. Timeout... Look at the show, listen to the music. Outstanding! The show that those Pink Floyd lads pulled off is just unbelievable. The light show, the whole setup... no concert I have seen or been to has even come close to the magnificence of Pulse.<br /><br />Just go to the nearest home theatre available to you, put in disc 1 and listen to the solo at the end of high hopes. Is there anything left to say after that? Gilmour, Mason and Wright prove that musicians, real artists are born not made... and they get better as time goes on. Classic!
B000G75AE8|2.0|Slayer if you must know really havent been the same since Divine Intervention, which along with Seasons and Reign In Blood is one of my favorite slayer albums. Divine saw Slayer taking a more techinical direction with riffs that blew the mind of any speed metal rythm player. While Undisputed Attitude gave us Gemini it was basically one of the biggest flops slayer ever \\"tryed\\" to pull off. I've always been a fan of Bostaph but its nice to see Dave back in Slayer even if there writing skills now suck more than ever. I'll have to admit while not being the biggest fan of Diabolus and God Hates Us All the playing on those albums was a lot \\"tighter\\" than anything found on this album, perhaps because of Lombardo sliding back into the drummer throne? Maybe so. The one thing i do know is while i like Slayer they seem to get stuck in the same ole formula, while Diabolus covered some new ground for Slayer, which most fans didn't take kindly to, this album covers absolutely NOTHING new. Christ Illusion has to be one of the most cliche, Deicide ridden names i've ever heard on an album, and quite frankly a 9 year old could have came up with that title. The songs Cult and Black Serenade are about as old school as you get with CI, while the rest of the album just goes back to more of Tom's repetative GOD HATES US ALL!! screaming, which to me is not Slayer at all, where's the creativity? where are the songs with catchy riffs and hook's like Season's and Angel of Death? Well if your looking for that you won't find it here, this is just more of the same ole same ole. You can only be so evil for so long before you paint yourself into a black corner. Also Slayer have never ever been melodic which is more my cup of tea when it comes to metal. So, while i don't hate Slayer i guess i've just grown out of them and am tired of the same old BS, also i miss Paul:( So if you must go Hot Topic and pick up the album for 9.99, if not just download the songs from Soulseek as i did, thank god(or satan) i didnt waste my money on yet another run of the mill album.
0060934913|5.0|I saw this book on this website, and after just reading what it was about and some notes from the author I knew this was going to be a good book, and I was not dissapointed. This is a great book to read...its funny, it keeps you turning the page, and its informative. I am really glad I read this book, and I recommend it for all cooks.
B000EHSVQ4|2.0|i did not like the theater version and this version is not much better. so if you did not like the theater version beware you might not like this one too.
B000G75AE8|3.0|If you're looking for a glorious reunion CD, this is nothing but a return to the \\"good ol' days\\" & nothing more. In other words a SAFE release; like Judas Priest's reunion album 'Angel of Retribution.'(Except Priest's reunion album is better!) This album sounds like the last few albums were never made & leads off of 'Divine Intervention,' which is a pretty good album but this one isn't quite as good. There's nothing really special---it just sounds like the band was trying to sound like they used to as the original lineup, but there was something lacking. (Considering the time we fans waited for this d@mn thing, it should have been better & maybe have some more tracks as well.) You're better off with their last album 'God Hates Us All' if you're looking for a killer album from Slayer.
0060574216|4.0|If I had known this before, my relationships would have been a lot easier! Men and women really are different in so many ways! <br />Don't expect change, but at least after reading this book you will understand more.
B000G75AE8|5.0|Ok, oK, Let me say it again, the kings are back!!!!!!! i cant help it to smile, years and years back after the release of Reign In Blood i became a little reluctant to trust again this guys, yeah south of heaven was decent, seassons in the abyss were even more decent, but after the glorious Reign In Blood  Slayer released only \\"decent\\" albums, but i was intrigued this time with Christ Illusion, first of all because of the Lombardo return to drums, second because the sleeve artwork have the same spirit as in Reign In Blood , i guess the same artist made it, so i checked first the free tunes that the net offers and i couldnt help it to smile, Slayer are the kings!!!!! definitelly they are the kings \\"Christ Illusion\\" sounds as if this were released the next year Reign In Blood were released , they sound fresh again, and even more agressive, \\"Catalyst\\" is one of my favorite tracks , lyrically Araya sounds existencialist , agressive , socially concern, introspective , there are also other awesome tracks such as \\"fresh storm\\" , \\"skeleton Christ\\" and \\"eyes of the insane\\" King and Hanneman couldnt be in better shape as in this new recording, riffs sound fast, furious and insane, definitelly Slayer is back!!!!!!!!!
B00000DR5D|5.0|This 1975 recording captures Tangerine Dream at what I think is the pinnacle year of their peak period (1974-1976), and features the classic lineup: Edgar Froese, Chris Franke, Peter Baumann.  They were on top of their game at this point.  Part 1 was recorded in France during the autumn of 1975 (most likely in September) and has more of a rhythm/groove to it than Part 2, thanks in large part to Froese's guitar playing.  Part 2 was recorded on 75-Oct-23 at Fairfield Hall in Croydon, England.  It starts off with some gentle piano playing before delving into Tangerine's more traditional synth playing, then ends gently again.  The sound quality is very good and the audience is not heard other than at the beginning/end.  This was not some studio wizardry, as almost all Tangerine concert recordings I've heard during this period have incredibly well behaved audiences that usually only make noise before and after a musical segment.  Apparently, the band made some changes to the raw live tape in the studio.  Comparing the untouched recording to Ricochet Pt 2 confirms this.  Nevertheless, Ricochet is a great cd and my favorite of their original LP live releases.  Both Ricochet and Boxed Set Vol 1 (which is a more complete and untouched recording from the 75-Oct-23 show) are highly recommended if you are a fan of this fruitful period of Tangerine Dream.
B0001Z53AQ|4.0|I thought this was a pretty solid album overall. I agree that it does sound like the quintessential eminem-laced lp, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing. Of course there are the standard novelty tracks like My Band, but there are also some more developed cuts such as \\"keep talkin'\\" and \\"good die young.\\" The latter track in specific is a very mature piece. The verse spit by Kuniva alone is nothing short of a masterpiece and proves, once again, that he is a highly underrated emcee. In the end, the album was a bit lacking in the instrumental department. I think some live instruments would have done a better job highlighting the nice flow that D12 has.
B00005JOVJ|5.0|First off, I don't know how this movie could've possibly recieved such a low rating.  This movie is beyond 3.5 stars, it's like 1000 stars.  Only one word could explain this movie, amazing.
B00005JO9J|5.0|Loved watching the beginnings of one of the greatest shows on TV!  Can't wait for the 2nd season to make it to DVD in Sept.!
B000E97Y6A|4.0|The storyline is familiar: A renegade film maker lands aground on a primitive island filled with beasts and tribal savages, takes a huge ape captive with the idea of having him in a live dramatic production, except that the production goes awry when the ape escapes and terrorizes New York.    The best part of this second effort at remaking the classic 1933 film is not the astounding special effects, nor is it the mayhem of Kong fighting dinosaurs and enemy aircraft. It is the poignant connection between the beauty and the beast. This is captured better than in any of the other renditions of the story.    The only quibble I have with this film is the three hour running time. The story would have been more effective and more powerful if it was tighter and more compact. But Peter Jackson is determined to overwhelm us with technology and special effects wizardry. The technology is the biggest monster in the movie.    I should also say that I was worried that I would be wasting three hours of my life being bored because I was watching something where I knew how it was going to end. But the interplay between the beauty and the beast had me hooked, and this made the film surprisingly less anticlimactic.    Jack Black does a good job playing the smarmy, sneaky, capitalizing film director. And Naomi Watts is stunning as Anne Darrow. It is a much better version of King Kong than the 1976 remake, though not as compact and powerful as the original.
B0000BWVCM|5.0|What a fantastic movie. The first was okay, but this just blows it out of the water. The characters are more fully developed; the set pieces are on a much grander scale; new characters are introduced; the dialogue still sparkles; the story thunders along with enough action to please anyone. This is the way comic books should be brought to life. Singer really knows his beans! If X-men 3 is as big an improvement on this, as this was on the first, it'll be the film of the year. This rocks! <br />
B000059XUO|4.0|I Love this movie. A mystical look at revenge, reincarnation, second chances, and last goodbyes. The soundtrack rocks, BRANDON LEE would have been huge, R.I.P.
B000G75AE8|2.0|Christ Illusion is easily Slayers worst album to date.  There are tons of nu-metal riffs, gay choruses for the trendwhores to sing along to, and horrid vocals from Tom Araya.  Take the first song, Flesh Storm, which starts off sounding like a modern-day War Ensemble, but breaks into a weak chorus that is almost unbearable to any old Slayer fan.<br /><br />I am still a Slayer fan, but after hearing this album, I cant say I would support this farce of a CD.  In fact, out of the 10 songs, Id have to say that there are only 2 or 3 worth listening to.  A song like Jihad, which starts off sounding like something Blink 182 would do, serves no purpose being on a Slayer album.  Toms vocals are getting to the point where they are downright annoying at times.  And the lyrics; I understand questioning religion, god and war, but the way it comes across is quite childish.<br /><br />There are some positives:  Dave Lombardo is back on drums, the production is similar to Seasons in the Abyss and well.......... thats it.  Sure there are some cool Slayer-sounding riffs here and there, but they throw in these god-awful, slow, nu-metal garbage riffs as well (for instance Black Serenade).  Maybe Kerry King has been listening to too much slipknot.  After 20+ years, maybe its time for Slayer to stop writing albums and just tour.<br /><br />Songs I can stand:  Cult, Consfearasy, Supremist<br />Songs that are horrible:  Eyes of the Insane, Jihad, Black Serenade<br /><br />The rest arent worth your time either.<br /><br />I must say its funny to read all these review saying ITS NOT NU-METAL blah blah blah.  Look whos writing this !!!  The majority of those giving 5 star reviews also gave 5 star reviews to bands like:  System of a Down, Marylin Manson, Chimaira and other garbage.<br /><br />Dont believe the hype !!!!!<br /><br />Me, I'll be listening to Hell Awaits.<br /><br />EDIT:  There's a reason this album can be bought on Amazon for .73 cents; the album sucks.
B000FS9FCQ|5.0|For me V for Vendetta was the best movie of 2005.  I saw it in the theater on the recommendation of a friend, and ordered the DVD as soon as it was available to pre-order on Amazon.  I've already seen it three times and I look forward to seeing it again.<br /><br />I purchased the two disc special edition version, and I cannot say in all honesty that the second disc is all that thrilling.  I would not go out of my way to pay extra for it.<br /><br />As far as the movie goes it is powerful and thought provoking.  A timely reminder that a government should be subservient to the people and not the other way around.  There is plenty of action, some great dialogue, some wonderful scenes.  It's just a damn good movie.  There are already a few hundred other reviews detailing the plot and the background to the movie.  Suffice to say this is a good one, and should be on your must see list.
B000AU9UYM|3.0|I came to this movie expecting to be blown away. I was. By the dreadful editing which made the action sequences totally unwatchable. The Matrix set new standards for action movies and what is to be expected of stars - gone are the days of a stuntman jumping in just to open an envelope in case the star gets a paper cut - now they can expect to spend months training to pull off realistic action choreography. Well, only if the editing lets you see that action and doesn't jump around so much you can't follow a single thing. So, I don't know if Bale learned to kick butt or if he used a stand-in, but it doesn't matter as you can't tell what's happening anyway. <br /> <br />As if that isn't bad enough, they then reveal Batman's back story - some screw loose loon saved by Tibetan Temple, Ninja-style training and philosophy. I don't know the comic genealogy to know how close this is to the origins of Batman, but it just didn't work for me. The temple and philosophy? Maybe. A ninja? Get out of here.  <br /> <br />The Batmobile was cool. Caine and Freeman delivered as they always do, though they didn't have a great deal to work with. The plot had holes. The story was passable. The sets impressive. The action sequences just blurry mush. See it or don't see it, but it's not a movie to cry about if you miss it. <br /> <br />Really, really, REALLY disappointed with this movie. <br /> <br />
B0000AMRJC|5.0|This movie defined an era in 80's Miami that ring so true, as a child of Cuban American parents and living in at the one time small city ,might have fictionalized characters but the story tells it like it was. NOt only that, but prompt the character Tony Montana to icon status. The movie was protested and boycotted in Miami for its poor potrayal of Cubans at the time but in Fidel's Mariel Boatlift it rang nothing but truth, Miami is small no more still fast, flashy and furious in a very discreet and low key manner making this movie the birth of the urban and hip hop communities in Miami. I love it just for what it is an over the top violent fictional true story.
B000E1ZBGS|4.0|This classic adaptation of Jane Austen, calibers with rigorous accuracy, the emotional barriers, masked of social conventions and no sense prejudices nestled in the Victorian ages (and still on) around the meaning of the real nature of the human being despoiled of so many rigid mental schemes that prison our minds, and souls. Fortunately our min personages visualized these taboos and could surpass it to find their bliss. The film is extremely slow until the first half, then it revitalizes through smart dialogues and unavoidable confrontations. Standard performances and splendid landscapes make of this movie a recommendable ocassion. The best of the cast were Judi Dench and Donald Shutherland, by far.<br /><br />The nature invented the pride to avoid us the pain of recognizing our imperfections.
B000062YAZ|5.0|Out of all the CD's I own by so many great Metal bands this is hands down My ABSOLUTE FAVORITE!!! In the mid 80's I purchased this album on record and quickly wore it out in no time at all!! Shortly after I purchased it on cassette and eventually CD in the 90's, but the Re-master is definitely the BEST version You could possibly purchase. \\"Reign In Blood\\" is truely My favorite SLAYER album of ALL time out of thier entire catalog followed closely by: \\"South Of Heaven\\" and \\"Hell Awaits\\".This incredible album has everything a fan of Thrash and Black Metal could possibly ever want. The production and sound quality is absolutely AMAZING!! thanks to Rick Rubin and Def Jam/Def American records.No matter how many years go by this album holds up to the test of time and has paved the way for so may terrific bands of today (ie;Cradle Of Filth,Emperor,Immortal,Dimmu Borgir,DEATH).The musicianship on this album is strictly top notch, This IS the album that made Dave Lombardo a household name as one of the BEST metal drummers in the world. \\"Reign In Blood\\" is some of His BEST work EVER!! The album from start to finish is a pure sonic blast to the ears and brutal from the beginning to the end. Jeff Hanneman and Kerry King's guitar work has enough CRUNCH to RIP YOUR SPEAKERS TO SHREADS!! and Tom Araya's vocals and Bass playing are both fantastic and angry beyond no measure!!The original release supporting 10 tracks has NOW been re-released with two new additional tracks bringing the Full Audio Assault to a total of 12 ALL digitally remastered!!For fans familiar with the original release (but not the remaster) the 2 new additional tracks are track #11) \\"Aggresive Perfector\\" (originaly released on the \\"Haunting The Chapel E.P.\\")and track #12)\\"Criminally Insane\\" (Remix). The new added tracks have the same production and sound quality as the rest of the album so it appears as if they had always been there on the original release (which is a great added touch to this Metal Masterpiece).If I honestly had to pick My favorite track on this disc it would be a toss up between \\"Angel Of Death\\" and \\"Raining Blood\\" (They are BOTH incredible!!). For NEW fans getting into SLAYER and unsure which album to purchase first look no further THIS IS IT!!You can sample the tracks HERE on AMAZON to get an idea of how Heavy and great this album is!!This is definitely one of those albums that is recommended to be listened to VERY LOUD to fully appreciate the brutal force that is SLAYER!!!I highly recommend this album to anyone who loves Thrash,Death, or Black Metal!!This album absolutely SHREADS!!Don't hesitate on this one!! LONG LIVE THE ALMIGHTY SLAYER!!<br />PS:I also recommend SLAYER's \\"Hell Awaits\\",\\"Seasons In The Abyss\\",\\"South Of Heaven\\" and the \\"Haunting The Chapel E.P.\\" I hope this review was helpful to You and please check out My other reviews on Thrash,Death,and Black Metal bands!!If I honestly had to pick My favorite track on this disc it would be a toss up between \\"Angel Of Death\\" and \\"Raining Blood\\" (They are BOTH incredible!!).

1594200440|5.0|Sweet, funny, and heartfelt, at times sad, at times poignant, but always always fresh and is an amazingly fun read.  It was hard for me not to just read right through in one sitting!
B0000A98ZP|5.0|Definitely by far the best movie ever made about teenagers in high school. Teen ANgst hasn't changed much since then, parnets hate their rebellious kids and kids know it, or even their over achievers or under achieving children so they lash out with their counterparts and head to detention and become life long friends. The best scene is the Lunch scene and Alley Sheedy's Makeover, imagine it played out on a up to date version and it would fall flat. Hopefully they would leave this alone and not remake it anytime soon, or would it be interesting to watch the list of characters for a 2000 version? Watch the original and see if it stands the test of time!
B00029QWII|3.0|I couldn't watch this movie, whatever its merits, more than once. There's not a lot of love in it. With all the violence the movie seems mostly designed for people who like to see whippings. The old films like Ben Hur and King of Kings do a better job of conveying Our Lord's love and suffering.
0345440900|5.0|I feel bad for the two reviewers who found little or no use for this book (and especially the lactation consultant who, it seems, sort of missed the point of the book). My wife and I did not come across this book until our daughter was three weeks old. Not only was Ms. Hogg's advice practical and lucid, it dealt more with issues regarding context and content rather than any pervasive theoretical ones. The EASY program worked beautifully for our daughter. As it is, this is the one book my wife and I recommend to our friends who are expecting. Yeah, there are too many \\"luvs\\" in the text, and maybe all of the advice presented isn't for all parents..but this is the best book, in my experience as a parent, for those who may tend to overthink. Sometimes the simplest guidelines are all we really need.
B000E6UK5K|5.0|For one who has been waiting a long time for some new familiar sounds, David Gilmore delivers in this CD.  It takes about three listens before one realizes his genius.  Take time to hear the lyrics.
B0009QQ6GC|5.0|I highly recommend shelling out a few more bucks for this remastered version (Atlantic Masters, 2005)--the sound is greatly improved (higher resolution, more \\"information\\") compared to the original CD version.  Sounds more like you're listening to four great musicians instead of a recording of 'em.  This is a classic and beautiful album that was revolutionary at its time, and is still very appealing today.  Incidentally, I noticed it's one of only a handful of Jazz albums that appears on the Rolling Stone Top 500 albums of all time list.<br /><br />This is an excellent product, and should be distinguished from the original CD version.
B00004RF8J|5.0|I knew nothing of Little Shop of Horrors before I bought the DVD, except that it was a musical. I'm very happy that I bought it. It's one of my favorite musicals now. The hit off-broadway musical was a success in its transition to film. The special effects of Audrey II were also amazing and very life-like (especially for the 80s). And of course the acting and the music was amazing. Rick Moranis did a great job, and seems to have been made for this role.
B000G75AE8|5.0|Well Slayer is back to do what they do best, rip your face off.  One aspect that has always kept me a strong fan of Slayer, besides their gut wrenching music is that they have always delivered.  Granted there are Slayer albums I enjoy more than others but I have never needed to listen to one of their records before purchasing it.  I have never finished listening to a Slayer album and said, \\"Oh man, what have they done? This is terrible.\\"  I know when I first buy a Slayer record that I am getting nothing but full force, throat ripping pure brutal heavy freakn' metal.  With the release of \\"Christ Illusion\\" they have delivered and then some.<br /><br />The album starts with the song \\"Flesh Storm\\".  The intro, fast paced guitars and drums presents the signature Slayer sound.  The record then continues to shred with tracks such as \\"Catalyst\\" and \\"Skeleton Christ\\".  Things then begin to take a small change with the track \\"Eyes of the Insane\\".  One can tell that Slayer is trying something a bit different with new riffs and tempo changes.  However it still works well and stays within the realms of Slayer's signature sound.  \\"Jihad\\" is a complete thrash song and Araya'a vocals are fast and fearsome on this one.  The second half of the album continues to shred.  There are more new riffs on tracks such as \\"Catatonic\\" and \\"Black Serenade\\" which adds some new great flavor to album.  The record then ends with quintessential Slayer attitude with the \\"Cult\\"(my personal favorite on the album) and \\"Supremist\\".<br /><br />All in all this entire album does not disappoint. It is pure Slayer through and through.  I would go as far as to state that it is Slayer's best release since \\"Seasons of the Abyss\\".  Basically it continues with the same theme as \\"Reign in Blood\\", South of Heaven, and Seasons.  So listen and thrash around until your body goes numb.
B00007KLJJ|4.0|To me, this movie is neither about cowardice nor heroism.  I think my views are a result of my time at Khe Sanh, Vietnam, almost 40 years ago.   <br /> <br />I saw the 1939 version 50 years ago, and it has always been imprinted in my mind.  That is why I bought the version which has the Director's comments included, which I think adds much to the enjoyment of the movie.   <br /> <br />The reason I say this movie version is not about cowardice, regardless of Mason's intentions in his book, is because Harrys reason's for resigning are well stated in the movie: He is in love, and he never wanted to be a soldier.   He is only in the army because his father is a general and he is compelled by family tradition and loyalty to follow in his father's footsteps.  However, once he made the commitment to his buddies, he should not have resigned, and that is what compels him to go to Sudan-principally to fulfill his obligation to his buddies, and only secondarily to salvage his Victorian Era self-image.  Jack Durrance's speach at the end, nicely, and quite cleverly I thought, ties this facet of the movie together.   <br /> <br />As to political correctness, I failed to see where the movie suffered due to a few lines which could be critisized for this.  When at Khe Sanh, more than a few times I must admit, I asked myself the question \\"What possible reason is there for a poor kid from a mining town in Arizona to be living like an animal in a red clay foxhole a few miles from Laos and the DMZ in Vietnam, firing his rifle at another poor kid he can't even see who is fighting IN HIS OWN COUNTRY for his country's freedom?\\"  I thought the British military tradition, on both an Empire and an individual foot-soldier level was very well presented in a favorable light. <br /> <br />I believe the Abu Fatma chaacter contributed enormously to the success of the film.  The Islamic obligation of courtesy, respect and charity (which I have personally experienced in my travels with my wife of 39years in Turkey and the Middle East) was an enjoyable, and in my opinion essential, aspect.   <br /> <br />No movie exactiy reflects the book, and some changes to plot, etc., don't bother me.  It's the overall presentation which is important.   <br /> <br />I highly recommend this movie to anyone.   <br />
B00005JKC3|3.0|This have been a better movie if they kept the demographic audience in mind. It didn't need a complicated script. It was a slow start. Forty minutes before any real action started. It's when Bruce Banner has repressed childhood memories resurface that it becomes interesting. The special effects are not great but good enough. I loved him rampaging through Utah and San Francisco (Hulk-a-roni, the San Francisco treat!). I like Nick Nolte as David Banner, the mad scientist. His speech near the end of the movie amused me. And the last three to five minutes was perfect ending. At least it was to me.
B0002OERI0|4.0|This album didn't really click for me when I first listened to it. It had to grow on me, and it did. Here are my ratings and comments for each song:<br /><br />1. American Idiot  5/5 This was the very first Green Day song I ever heard. It's what got me hooked actually. Very good song.<br /><br />2. Jesus of Suberbia 1/5 My least favorite song on the album. I like the beat of the first couple parts of the song, but I really don't like the lyrics. I always skip this track whenever I listen to the album.<br /><br />3. Holiday 5/5 This is a very good song also.<br /><br />4. Boulevard of Broken Dreams 5/5 Many people get so sick of this song, but I never do. This is probably my favorite on the album.<br /><br />5. Are We the Waiting 4/5 It's a slower song compared to the rest of the album, but it's still good if you want something slow to listen to.<br /><br />6. St. Jimmy 5/5 Great fast paced song.<br /><br />7. Give me Novacain 5/5 I don't care much for the lyrics but I love the way it sounds.<br /><br />8. She's a Rebel 4.5/5 I like this song too, but I wouldn't really give it a 5/5 rating.<br /><br />9. Extraordinary Girl ?/5 I haven't really listened to this song all the way through.<br /><br />10. Letterbomb ?/5 ditto<br /><br />11. Wake Me up When September Ends 5/5 Love it<br /><br />12. Whatsername ?/5 See #9.<br /><br />So overall, I gave this CD 4 stars. And yes, I do listen to some older Green Day stuff too.
B000002I2M|3.0|At this point, Jim Morrison had pretty well drank himself to the state of uselessness, at times showing up for sessions late (or not at all) and not usually cooperating when he did. So it's a surprise that there's anything even remotely listenable about this album. And there is - six of ten songs are quite good, but this one's still quite overrated.<br />But nobody will deny the presence of three Doors classics: Love Her Madly, L.A. Woman and Riders on the Storm. These three make up by far the best material on this album, the title track being not only the greatest song to be found here, but arguably the Doors' best tune, period (with competition from The End and Five to One). Everything about this one blends so well, and Morrison's vocals and lyrics are at his best. Eerie hit Riders on the Storm never fails to send chills down my spine, with some powerful imagery and a jazzy electric piano. The flat-out rock of Love Her Madly recalls the first album, again the keyboards on this song are a nice touch, and the lyrics/vocals are perfect! Plus we also get The Changeling, which has a nice organ part to make up for the poor lyrics, Been Down So Long (I love Jim's vocals!) and a cover of the John Lee Hooker classic Crawling King Snake which is good in spite of annoying double-tracked vocals.<br />Now, for the bad. First off, Cars Hiss By My Window is a filler other than the \\"sax\\" solo that's really Jim's vocals. (Special thanks to Music Is Love for pointing that out!) Hycanith House and L'America are simply fillers, and The WASP isn't half as profound as Morrison would like it to be.<br />This was the last album the Doors released with Jim Morrison before Morrison was found dead in his bathtub, and for all practical purposes their last album. Sure, the surviving Doors cut two albums (Other Voices and Full Circle) but they both flopped, and neither were reiussed on CD. Jim was truly the heart and soul of the group.<br />L.A. Woman is slightly overrated, but has its moments.

B000051VWW|5.0|Sade is a band, it is not a female singer. Sade was one of the biggest brittish groups of the mid-80's. Their jazz-pop sound made them stars and 'Diamond Life' was one of the best selling records in the UK for many years. Sade's discography can be described in chapters. The Jazz-pop chapter which includes the albums 'Diamond Life' and the masterpiece 'Promise'. Then we have the 'World Music' chapter. 'Stronger than Pride' has many spanish influences and latin american influences. also some reggae rythms can be traced.(Sade Adu lived for some time in Spain and married a spaniard). 'Love Deluxe' has an american r& b and rock influence within a brittish \\"trip-hop\\" frame (this has been their biggest album in the US). 'Lover's Rock' is a different album. It is not a jazz-pop album and it does not have the signature sound of 'Love Deluxe'(no electric guitars or strong drum machines). 'Lover's rock' is a mellow album with soft reggae and chill style sounds. It has a 'Lounge-chill' texture that is so popular in europe (there are many lounge -chill albums in the market and others like Bjork's Vespertine album follow this european music trend). This is a great album, the best since 'Stronger than Pride'.

B00005JOQS|4.0|First on the cast: Love Kevin Spacey as Lex and Parker Posey as Kitty. Brandon Routh's physionomy bears uncanny resemblance to all other actors ever in the role of the Superman. Kate Bosworth BORING Lois Lane (but then again, Teri Hatcher is the only L. Lane who's not an annoying loser of a chick).<br />Special effects extremely obvious.<br />And now to the really disappointing bit - it is, beyond doubt, the script. Superboy portrayed as lovesick stalker (guess L. Lane is not married to the man she lives with to keep Superman's shmoozing with Lane politically correct?!). Cryptonite embedded in the crystal soil cripples him and brings him to brink of death on one occasion, but a lil later he pulls it out of the earth's core and launches it into space almost unaffected? L. Lane in Luthor's boat locked in the pantry with her son and they sit opposite each other on the floor? Huh??! What sort of a mother is that? But a lil later she dives into the ocean to save the Superguy (and leaves her husband in the plane, looking like a moron). She pulls a 105 kilo guy from the water like its nothing? Then she marches to Superman's hospital bed like the celebrity she is not (and she is NOT Superman's relative). Its so annoying! They could have done a better job at it. 4 stars only cuz I am a fan.
B0000024JN|5.0|I was 13 years old when I got the vinyl LP for the Beastie Boys debut album. This was the era of Run-DMC, Eric B. and Rakim, LL Cool J, etc. Most of the rappers in this so-called golden age of hip-hop pretty much rapped over sampled and mixed beats and scratching. The Beastie Boys debut album, Licensed to Ill, added a new flavor in that mix: rock riffs combined with hip-hop beats and scratches. The fact that they were a trio of white kids from Brooklyn only helped to add to their charm.<br /><br />Licensed to Ill doesn't deviate from the tried-and-true one-up-manship in the lyrics. Most of the tracks include bragging, partying, and a slew of other juvenile acts. It was great. My favorite tracks from this album has to be \\"Brass Monkey\\", \\"Paul Revere\\", \\"Hold It Now, Hit It\\", and \\"Slow and Low\\". They've become better artists since their debut in 1986, but none of their later albums have had the same kid of impact as Licensed to Ill nor as fun as that first album.

B000089A07|4.0|Red Dragon is the prequel to the acclaimed Silence of the Lambs, and details how Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) was captured and his first cat-and-mouse game with FBI agent Will Graham (Edward Norton) as they hunt the serial killer known as the Tooth Fairy.<br /><br />There is an older version of Red Dragon known as Manhunter which did not star Hopkins in the signature role. That's probably why Universal opted for this remake, and there's definitely some appeal in seeing Hopkins do his thing again. The cast is made up of Hollywood all-stars. The script and acting are solid, and the movie is quite entertaining as a psychological thriller/horror film.<br /><br />The problem is that the film isn't really distinctive. Whereas Silence of the Lambs had a gritty feel, Red Dragon occasionally reeks of its Hollywood polish. It reuses a lot of what made Silence of the Lambs memorable, but doesn't add anything new. Even Hannibal, the controversial third movie, was very unique in what it did. Brett Ratner, though he's now done this, Rush Hour, and X-Men 3, still hasn't established a directorial style. He puts out a solid effort, but also because so much of the development and talent was already there. This is truly a Hollywood product that could've directed itself, and no matter how fun the film is, there's no escaping that.<br /><br />Fortunately Ratner packed the 2-disc edition with lots of bonus material, and he looks like he gave the film his all. We get a nice documentary, as well as lots of screen tests of various effects and makeup. It's a very strong dvd package, and worth the purchase over the single disc.<br /><br />Red Dragon comes up short when matched against the pedigree of the films before it, but its still an entertaining film and completes the Hannibal series nicely.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|This album is fantastic. The music is all great (with the exception of the fairly dissapointing 'This Dying Soul') and the songs definately don't lack appeal. It's a nice, heavy departure from the bands progressive roots. <br /> <br />But there-in lies the problem. Basically they've stripped down the progressive feel of Scenes From A Memory and Images and Words and just come out with a straight up heavy metal album. It's still excellent, but it's not Dream Theater excellent. <br /> <br />Highlights on the album are As I Am, Honor Thy Father, Vacant, and In The Name of God. Each of these songs - with the exception of Vacant - are very heavy, and very loud. Mike Portnoy's drums don't quite stand out as much as I'd like, but have their moments, such as Honor Thy Father.  <br /> <br />While it it's not up to par with everything else Dream Theater, the album definately deserves credit as better than most metal albums.
B00004WEJZ|3.0|If you've gotten tired of the formula Bond movies, Never Say Never Again is an interesting change of pace. Legal battles based on the rights to the Thunderball novel led to this remake being done by a different studio than the other 007 films. They managed to bring back Sean Connery, who had said \\"never again\\" after finishing Diamonds Are Forever (hence the movie title).<br /><br />The original Thunderball movie is still better in terms of epic scale and production values, but for me this film beats out Diamonds Are Forever and most of the Roger Moore entries. It helps that Connery still has his edge even as an older Bond, and in general it's just fun to see a different take on M, Q, Moneypenny, and the villains of SPECTRE. Unfortunately while MGM finally got the rights to this film, they refuse to acknowledge it into the regular Bond movie canon. So while the dvd cover is similar in design to the other Bond special editions, the disc has no bonus features other than a nice booklet and trailer. Oh well.<br /><br />Recommended for all Bond fans, and worth a look for anyone interested in the \\"non-official\\" Bond film.

B00009RGBS|5.0|<br />  I never get tired seeing this beautiful production.  I find myself humming the music out of the clear blue sky not even thinking about  it.  I also just saw recently  Chicago in a local San Antonio, Texas presentation put on by a local group.  It was wonderful.  The group was quite professional and wonderful which prompted me to order this from you.  I had seen this movie maybe three or four times.  It's delightful and will always be well received. <br /> <br />
B000FGGE5Y|4.0|Ultraviolet sheds light on a futuristic society that has been plagued by a virus that nearly transformed the population into hemophages (vampire-like creatures), but has survived and is now on its way back to full recovery.   A carrier of the virus takes it upon herself to steal the government's secret project believing that it is a weapon meant to destroy them.  What she ends up with, however, maybe more than she bargained for...  There are strong elements/hints of Aeon Flux, Underworld, and V for Vendetta, so the movie falls into the sci-fi/action/adventure type of category.  Apart from Milla Jovovich (who is GORGEOUS!!!) and the lovely colors seen throughout the film, the plot and the dialogues are poor at best.  The rest of the cast is mediocre.  As for the computer graphics, they are not that great and often one gets the feeling that they are watching a computer game of average graphics instead of a motion picture.   Though not a masterpiece and probably not a movie you would want to add to your collection, Ultraviolet might provide for an evening's entertainment.  3.5 Stars
B000B5XOSO|5.0|What happens when you give a director virtually every freedom possible when making a big blockbuster sequel? Well, if you are Warner Bros. and are working with Tim Burton, \\"Batman Returns\\" is what you get. Lots of things can be said for this movie. Naysayers could say it's too graphic, dark, depressing and flat-out mean. However, those who appreciate the dark-side of the Dark Knight should appreciate this entry in the franchise. Perhaps I was a little too young to be watching this movie in 1992, but yet, I was still intrigued. I could not look away, almost as if my favorite superhero was in a horror movie.<br /><br />Now, you should note that \\"Batman Returns\\" is not for everyone. If you thought Burton's original \\"Batman\\" was dark and scary, this one might put you over the edge. Little kids, in general, really should not be watching this, which is ironic considering all the action figures this movie spewed forth. In this movie, Bruce Wayne (with Michael Keaton reprising his role) is pitted against the sewer-dwelling Penguin (portrayed spot-on by Danny Devito), falls for Selina Kyle/Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer) and deals with a devious megalomaniac in Max Shreck (Christopher Walken). If Batman doesn't have trouble while he's at work, he at least has enough emotional troubles to deal with at home. \\"Batman Returns\\" is really quite a complex and dense movie. On one hand, it is a big summer blockbuster, and a sequel. On the other hand, it is a bit of a psychological thriller that really pokes into the Batman/Bruce Wayne psyche. Everything about this film evokes a certain mood -- from the Christmas-time setting, the grey skies and snow, too Penguin's gloomy lair and Selina Kyle's dumpy bachelorette-pad. It's almost too well made.<br /><br />\\"Batman Returns\\" surely isn't an everyday movie. Personally, I find I have to be in a certain mood to appreciate it. Which is simply why the movie didn't make the intended splash at the box office and why many critics panned it. Regardless, it is still a Batman movie, and in my opinion, still stays true to the character. If there's any fault, it's that it's too risky for it's own good. But still a deliciously evil 'Batman' flick that's always good for the holidays.ardless, it is still a Batman movie, and in my opinion, still stays true to the character.

B00006IUL7|1.0|I am amazed and mystified that most of the reviewers herein found the movie to be excellent!! As for me, I made it about thirty minutes into the film before turning it off in dismay. The fault in order of importance: poor screenplay, poor cinematography and poor performance by Pacino, who seems to be vying for the most over-the-top performance. The film was absurd in many ways from the outset: the pans from star to star lasting just short of giving the viewer any purpose for any of the fast camera pans. Close-up after close-up conveying no meaning, Pacino overacting like Jack Palance in one of his not-so-famous European pieces of tripe from the sixties and seventies, an utterly dumb plot with Pacino and company proving at the beginning that they are bumbling cops.  <br /> <br />First example, they chase the bad guy to a cabin which is on stilts or something like that; then, instead of staying on the ground below and smoking the bad guy out or something at least tactically sound, they storm the stairs and Pacino stands right in front of the door yelling \\"Police, you're under arrest.\\" <br /> <br />They kick in the front door and find that the culprit has escaped through an underground water source. Of course, Pacino follows and dives right into the underwater stream, having absolutely no idea where the guy is or if there are boobytraps of some sort.  <br /> <br />Cut to Pacino running around in nearly zero visibility fog, glimpsing the guy for a second or two before losing him in the fog. Stumbling around further, Pacino is obviously disoriented until a shot is fired at him from, we must assume, his quarry. Did the screen writer forget that Pacino's colleagues are also supposedly chasing the culprit, too?  <br /> <br />Inevitably and apparently not, because Pacino spots a figure in the fog and plugs him. As I watched this scene unfold, I became thoroughly disheartened when it becomes clear what I knew already, that Pacino has fired on and killed his partner. It was then that I decided that I had had enough.  <br /> <br />By the way, the European version, with Stellan Skarsgaard is infinitely superior. Don't waste your money or on-line rental queue on this Hollywood drivel. Ditto for the other Pacino junk I rented at the same time, The Recruit, which I could only stand for about a half hour too.

It's not just the incredible story (read Amazon synopses), it is the point of view Zusak uses and his writing style and the incredible way he puts words together. Rarely have I read a book that blew me away like this one. I just bought 5 copies to mail to friends.
B0009Y33H4|5.0|This CD rates with the best live CD packages out there (_Yessongs_, ELP's _Welcome Back My Friends . . ._, Mars Volta's _Scabdates_).  Take a world-class pack of musicians and have them play selections from a world-class catalog, insert some intriguing production values and, most important of all, rock hard at the concert you're recording, and you've got something very worthwhile.<br /><br />I'm not a VDGG completist (Yet!  I'm working on it!), but for sheer energy, this release ranks up there with their classic _Pawn Hearts_.  On their other studio releases, they play it a little safe sometimes.  Here, there are abundant moments of reckless energy and daring musicianship.  Foremost in these regards is the amazing Graham Smith on violin.  He adds just the right blend of virtuosity, harmony, and schizophonia to every song here.  The seventeen-minute \\"Pioneers Over C\\" is perfect in these regards, switching from epic lament to out-of-control to melodic dirge at the drop of a dime, all within the space of a minute.<br /><br />\\"A Plague of Lighthouse Keepers/ Sleepwalkers\\" is also amazing for the aplomb with which the band is able to add life to the original by throwing in what seem to be on-the-spot improvisations.  This furthers my belief that VDGG were the best improvisers of all the prog giants of the '70s.  Other bands could do it, but they couldn't make you FEEL the tension of the tightrope walk they were doing.  You seem to feel VDGG's vertigo with them as they make their material new.<br /><br />Besides earlier VDGG material like these songs, the lineup also treats some of Hammill's solo work and the later-'70s VDG.  This stuff stands up great!  I especially love the punkish \\"Nadir's Big Chance\\" with Guy Evans progifying it by making the drum part one big fill!!!  The studio version is great and this is just as great in its own way.<br /><br />Another beauty of this CD is Nic Poter's ur-bass on every song.  They've got grunge prefigured by about 12 years here with the so-thick-you-can-spread-it, ultra-distorted, way-up-in-the-mix fuzz grounding every song firmly in the muckety muck of existence that Hammill is so superb at expressing lyrically.<br /><br />Despite what the snobs say below, this CD is a must-own for every lover of challenging music.  I think you'll agree with the crowd that cheers enthusiastically and loudly in between every song.  VDG choose what's best out of their catalog, rock it silly, and renew it at every turn.  Only the best bands can do that and VDG show why they are in this category with this superb release.h the so-thick-you-can-spread-it, ultra-distorted, way-up-in-the-mix fuzz grounding every song firmly in the muckety muck of existence that Hammill is so superb at expressing lyrically.<br /><br />Despite what the snobs say below, this CD is a must-own for every lover of challenging music.

There are too many good songs that you will have difficulty in pick one for yourself.<br /><br />In Lost Dogs the band pass its life through all the 90s, since the early years with Ten and Vs, passing through the void that inspire No Code and Binaural, and finally arriving in the 2000s with the maturity of Riot Act.

0393035158|3.0|Harris is a capable writer, but his book of generalizations loses steam by the end. While he does criticize Christianity, it seems Harris mainly fears militant Islam. I agree that radical Islam needs to be confronted (of course, Harris believes religious moderation is a \\"myth\\"); however, I don't think this book is the way to do it.<br /><br />Simply put, this book is not going to convince anyone who is truly faithful to his or her religion to abandon it. This volume will \\"validate\\" more than it will persuade anyone. That being said, if you detest religion, you'll eat this book right up. Other people will see the generalities as somewhat narrow-minded.<br /><br />Furthermore, and most important, I am baffled as to why Harris failed to mention any of Alvin Plantinga's arguments on rationality. This serves to undermine Harris' points, since Plantinga is a leading philosopher--if not *the* leading philosopher--in the area of rational religious belief. Harris may be ignorant of Plantinga's arguments, though I find this difficult to believe since the author has a degree in philosophy. Plantinga is much too important to ignore in a book about faith and religion with the subtitle \\"The Future of Reason\\"; this glaring omission of his arguments cripples Harris' overall critique.<br /><br />If you've never heard of Plantinga, I suggest picking up Keith Parsons' \\"God and the Burden of Proof.\\" Though Parsons is an atheist, and there is always a danger in misrepresenting your opponent's views, he does a very good job of summarizing some of Plantinga's ideas for a general audience. Next, I suggest reading \\"The Analytic Theist\\" (edited by James Sennett), a collection of Plantinga's works. Though the book as a whole is difficult reading, some of the essays are accessible to non-scholars. Specifically, read Plantinga's inaugural address as the John A. O'Brien Professor of Philosophy at the University of Notre Dame (Chapter 11 in the book). Plantinga is a giant in philosophy, and he has earned the respect of many atheists. After thinking these works through, and reflecting on them, you will probably view Harris' book in a new light. There is no excuse for shutting out one of the leading scholars in the field from this debate, and it lends a certain incomplete feel to Harris' work here.
B000G75AE8|5.0|I loved God Hates Us All album !!!.  This one continues their great form !!  Lombardo lives and breathes back old life that was there during Seasons definitely a favourite of mine. <br /> <br />As with other reviewers Slayer has not lost any of their old speed or slow riffing and class touch to their evolving genre. Slipknot hopefully will learn from this album and rebuild for their next album. <br /> <br />Sumply the best album since Seasons of the Abysss and God hates us All.  Brilliant new SLAYER
034544678X|2.0|I found this book engaging and entertaining, however was led to believe by the promotional materials that it would be a bit denser with information.  If one edited out the personal anecdotes, endless references by the author to her own credentials (yes, yes, you have an advanced degree as does a substantial percentage of the population, please on to the information now) and \\"chimpanzees lite,\\" the book would be a leaner (50+ pages maybe) read rather than the slightly bloated tome it currently is.  Perhaps this is the publisher's fault.    Read it for the insightful and charming stories of the author's own well loved pooches.  For information on primatology, go to the horses' mouths (primatologists - many fine accessible books available).  For information on dog behavior, perhaps there is more out there.
B000BKVQTS|2.0|Terry Gilliam's 'The Brothers Grimm' has a lot going for it.  Stunning visually and occasionally funny, this madcap farce could have been great.   Heath Ledger and Matt Damon give spirited performances as Wil and Jacob Grimm.  Furthermore, the cinematography is beautifully illuminating, and the scenes are filled with cliff-hanging adventure.  So why doesn't it all work?    The components are all top quality, but it doesn't really come together.  There are even two plots skillfully interwoven:  The Brothers Grimm are kidnapped at a local pub by French soldiers and are conscripted to save an enchanted forest.  The vignettes of the fairy tales then work their way loosely into the main plot.  The effect is not unlike a Mel Brook's movie.  Gilliam and company do to the Grimm's fairy tales what Brooks did to the Frankenstein movies (in 'Young Frankenstein') or to Hitchcock (with 'High Anxiety'), except it seldom works right.  They also draw from other sources, making the inspiration of Grimm's 'Fairy Tales' much the way 'Shakespeare in Love' did for Shakespeare's plays.  It's a good premise to borrow from, but the execution also falls flat.  The film also remains true to the absurd Monty Python tradition, but these elements  often come off as forced and arbitrary.  There are bizarre elements as well, but this, too, is done in a random fashion.  (There is, for instance, an odd predilection for creepy insects that appear throughout the movie that seem unconnected to anything else that happens.)  Also, the sibling rivalry from the brother's relationship could have provided entertaining banter.  Instead, we get wit that wouldn't remind one of the weakest moments from the TV series 'Frazier'; and the slapstick is slapdash--nothing that would make it on the Cartoon Network.  If they did the whole affair straightforward, they would have made a magnificent movie.  But, in all fairness, one should judge a film by what it is rather than what it could have been.  True enough.  As afarce or as a weird trek, it fails.  Gilliam's brilliant work 'Brazil' illustrates why this movie pales in comparison--even though the special effects are matchless next to any other Python work. As an offbeat adventure, it also falls short.  The only thing that does work is the traditional adventure and enchantment.  They could have fixed the film in two ways:  If the writing were far better caliber, they would have made a movie par with the 'Bullwinkle' series, but as a grander spectacle, of course.  Their only other recourse was to play it straight and build an exciting adventure with a few, selective laughs thrown in.  And, with the ending, they almost pulled it off--instead it comes together with too many elements that don't work together.  The whole affair seems haphazard.  This is an admirable effort, but the shortcomings provide too many disappointments. (**1/2)

B000G75AE8|4.0|When the world is at it's worst, metal and punk are at their best. One of metal's most notorious, Slayer, has decided to grace us with their presence. Thankfully with Christ Illusion, they've come with an attitude and sense of urgency that has been absent for near a decade. While certainly not comparable to Hell Awaits or South of Heaven, Christ Illusion shows that Slayer will not go slowly into the night without a few bodies to drag behind them.<br /><br />The good news with Christ Illusion is that most of the problems that lied within God Hates Us All and Diabolus en La Musica are gone here. Tom Araya has finally decided to get rid of that horrible yell style he had going on the past two releases. Here, Tom sounds as though it were Seasons in the Abyss. His voice is top notch here folks. The traces of Slipknotish and groove like riffs are almost completely wiped away. The riffs are harsh, and although at times not memorable. they still pack a punch that Slayer fans have waited for. There are several songs that makes me just think, \\"Wow that almost sounds like Reign in Blood days\\". \\"Flesh Storm\\", \\"Catalyst\\", and a host of others take you back to a Slayer that knows how to get your head banging. It is very apparent that these guys are pissed and they want you to know it. Even the duds on the album, \\"Eyes of the Insane\\" and Black Serenade\\" would've been the better cuts on God Hates Us All. As a side note, The return of Dave Lombardo is a welcome surprise, as are the blast beats on \\"Supremist\\"!<br /><br />However, one has to realize that with a new Slayer, there are going to be two downfalls. Kerry King's lyrics while insightful at times, mostly come off horribly childish. Most of these guys are in their 40's, yet Kerry still has Tom screaming things that most 15 year olds are screaming in their basement. Yes, Kerry we get that you do not like religion without you having to say \\"Religion's a whore\\". Secondly, by this point with Slayer being who they are, the guys don't pull any blind punches. You can see whats coming a mile away lyrically, instrumentally, and song structure wise. I have no problem with consistency but after almost 25 years people have caught onto Slayer. To counter, I must say that is truly a gift to see Slayer continue to be relevent without comprimising their sound throughout at least 10 musicical trends of our time. Where are you now Hootie?<br /><br />I don't want to leave you with doubt, because I will say this is the most fun i've had listening to a new Slayer album since Divine Intervention. If this is Slayer's swansong, they've ended on a solid note. They survived with their metal counterparts softening their sound and managed to keep that certain diabolic madness to themselves. In Phillip K Dick's \\"A Scanner Darkly\\", theres a quote, \\"Can't we agree the world is getting progressively worse?\\". To that I say, Slayer wouldn't have it any other way.he guys don't pull any blind punches. You can see whats coming a mile away lyrically, instrumentally, and song structure wise.

B000002N2Z|5.0|I love the Deftones...can you tell?  This is probably one of their finest moments, although I don't believe they've put out a single album, track, whatever that I'm not impressed with, as far as consistency this is one of the best albums they've done (although Around the Fur and the recent ST album are up there...and I do love White Pony) every track here is just brilliant.  Someone mentioned that Chino's lyrics are contrite and uninspired.  BULL!!!  Chino is one of the most original lyricist's out there...just listen to the lyrical mastery on this album...but I will admit that he's grown so much over the course of his career.  Around the Fur alone shows a lot of maturity in lyrics.  This album to me is all about the music, all about the powerful riffs and pounding bass lines.  Songs like the opener 'Bored' made Deftones a welcome addition to nu-metal...but it's songs like '7 Words' 'Fireal' 'Fist' and 'Nosebleed' that keep me a devoted fan.  LOVE CHINO!  LOVE DEFTONES!  LOVE MUSIC!

B0002UOK04|5.0|I don't know much about frontman Jari M&auml;enp&auml;&auml;'s former band Ensiferum apart from the fact that they played what they called \\"heroic folk metal\\", but what I do know is that the debut album by Wintersun is one of the most beautiful metal albums ever to emerge from Scandinavia, as well as taking a high spot in Europe's top 50 metal albums (at least in my opinion). Though some may not find it as appealing due to melodic black/death metal's common usage in the Scandinavian metal theatre, but the music on here is absolutely stunning; despite being only eight songs, it almost reaches the hour-long point. Each instrument is played with beauty and precision that comes together in the end to make one hell of a masterpiece. This may also appeal to a large number of power metal fans who can handle the harsh vocals, as Jari also employs some wonderful viking metal vocals that remind one of early Bathory and Arcturus if they had been recorded a decade later. One thing's for sure, Jari fits comfortably in the ranks of Quorthon and Simen Hestaes (most recent vocalist of Arcturus) as viking metal's best.<br /><br />Jari M&auml;enp&auml;&auml; proves to any doubters that he is, in fact, a virtuoso, especially when you consider that he recorded this album alone, without the help of any other musicians except for session drummer Kai Hahto, who also does a great job giving the songs a precise and speedy beat like any good metal drummer should do. His vocals are among the album's highlights, as he sounds comfortable belting out mournful, epic tunes as well as screeching with the skill of a seasoned black metal vocalist. His guitars chug with the intensity of an active volcano and while he may not be one of the greatest soloists ever, he knows how to bust one out without sounding unnecessary, but they aren't very common on this disc as they aren't all that important to the progression of the album. The keyboards are wonderful wherever they are, whether spewing out atmospheric ambient tunes or playing fun, speedy solos reminiscent of Children of Bodom's Janne Warman. Bass, like on most epic melo-death recordings, falls to the back ranks unnoticed, but it isn't too important to the recording other than the need of a bass guitar in the works.<br /><br />Bottom line: if you're a melo-death fan, then you must get this, no matter how hard to find it is (if you see it, buy it, because God knows when you'll ever see it again). But even the average death metal fan and power metalhead will find something to enjoy on this album, as its lacing of grandiose musical structures and heaviness is a sure winner. Other good melodic death metal bands include Norther, Kalmah, and Children of Bodom.<br /><br />Track Selections: \\"Beyond the Dark Sun\\", \\"Death and the Healing\\", and \\"Sadness and Hate\\".<br /><br />10/10, speedy solos reminiscent of Children of Bodom's Janne Warman.

And it's even non-sexist--the girl rescues the boy as often as he rescues her, for instance, and even though she is obviously smart and well-educated (and not beautiful), she gets her guy in the end.  Fun story!  Wish I could erase all my memories of it and watch it or the first time again.
B00000HYXB|5.0|Power metal is often seen by fans of more extreme metal (particulary death metal) as being weak, as most power metal bands focus more on acheiving an epic sound (as opposed to technical ability) and employ operatic vocals. There are also not a lot of innovative musicians to be found in the confines of power metal, as the group often works as a collective to create conceptual, grandiose musical compositions instead of churning out virtuosic guitar solos. While some see this as a flaw, it also makes it easier to find power metal bands that stand out from the rest, and Blind Guardian easily fits into this category. Originally founded as a speed metal band, they slowly morphed their style into a sort of power-influenced speed metal, then focusing mostly on power metal with their 1998 masterpiece \\"Nightfall In Middle-Earth\\", which is a wonderful album at the very least. Even those who normally stay away from power metal might find something to like here, as the music displayed here is some of the best to ever grace the metal scene. Blind Guardian have always stood out from their peers in their ability to create impressive albums without sounding too cheesy or generic like much power metal turns out to be, and they have a style of their own that no other has been able to re-create. The lyrics are also very compelling, putting J.R.R. Tolkien's work into a musical composition that is the perfect companion to his \\"Silmarillion\\", which all the lyrics are based on. This also marked Blind Guardian's invasion of America, introducing many virgin ears to their wonderful mix of speed and power and encouraging Century Media to re-release the back catalog in the U.S.<br /><br />Hansi Kursch has one of the most dynamic voices in metal, having a gruff-sounding operatic voice that has personality as well as being well-executed. While other power metal vocalists seem to focus on ability rather than emotion, Hansi belts out the lyrics with immense power and precision that is never lost, even in a live setting. Some may notice that his vocals have improved in the three years since \\"Imaginations From The Other Side\\", and this is a result of him putting down the bass in order to increase his vocal range and focus only on that, leaving bass to Oliver Holzwarth. He is not an official member, but has a wider range of skill than Hansi and is a staple in the band, despite being lost in the epic sounds. Lead guitarist Andre Olbrich has a great musical ear, providing very medieval-sounding guitar solos that work perfectly with the theme of each album and, at the same time, retains the power he had back in their speed metal days. He and rhythm guitarist Marcus Siepen create a layer of wonderful riffing and solos that complement Hansi's vocals very well. And, as always, Thomen Stauch is arguably one of metal's best drummers, always sounding in time with the music and able to improvise without resorting to drumming wankery. He is also one of the reasons Blind Guardian acheived the fame that they did, as he has a style that is his own and few drummers come close to his raw power. Let's just hope that his replacement, Frederik Ehmke, can do a damn good job of filling his shoes.<br /><br />Bottom line: if you're a dedicated power metal fan or are looking to try something new after listening to extreme metal for so long, this is a good album to have in your collection. The production sounds rather top-heavy (meaning vocals are overemphasized and the rest of the band is sort of put in the background), a problem which has plagued most of Blind Guardian's albums. Once you've listened to this and loved it, also check out their \\"A Night at the Opera\\" and \\"Imaginations From The Other Side\\" albums to get the full effect of this wonderful German band.<br /><br />Track Selections: \\"Into the Storm\\", \\"Nightfall\\", and \\"Mirror Mirror\\"<br /><br />9/10live setting.

B000002UAR|5.0|Could the Beatles have possibly imagined, four decades ago, how many rock albums that would follow would be heavily influenced by Revolver? For instance, Ozzy Osbourne considers it to be his all-time favorite album.    But I digress. Revolver is worthy of every bit of praise it gets (Rolling Stone named it #3 in their list of the 500 greatest albums of all time in 2003). This album, in addition to its predecessor Rubber Soul, features the world's most famous Liverpudlians in between their two eras: the straight-forward pop-rock of the early 1960's, and the psychedelia and heavy experimentation (\\"Revolution 9\\", anyone?) of the late 1960's. Songs like the satirical \\"Taxman\\", and the witty \\"Doctor Robert\\" feature elements of the early Beatles, but the swirling melodies of \\"She Said, She Said\\" and \\"And Your Bird Can Sing\\", the horn-and-brass-laden \\"Got To Get You Into My Life\\" (actually an ode to marijuana), the sad-sounding string orchestra of \\"Eleanor Rigby\\", the Indian-influenced \\"Love You To\\", and, of course, the very trippy closer \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" (also my favorite on the album), show the Fabs trying new styles, and making it work. Also, we cannot forget Ringo's legendary sing-along \\"Yellow Submarine\\" (which would later inspire a movie), the sunny-sounding \\"Good Day Sunshine\\", the ballad \\"For No One\\", George's bouncy \\"I Want To Tell You\\", the backwards-guitar-solo-featuring lullaby \\"I'm Only Sleeping\\", and the slow, mellow, soothing sound of \\"Here, There, and Everywhere\\". This is the stuff of legends.    George Harrison once said that he felt that Rubber Soul, and this, were parts one and two of the same album. He's got a point; as I said before, both albums contain elements of both Beatle eras. If you listen closely to \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\", you can hear the death knell of the first era (I don't mean that in a bad way, I'm saying that it was the official beginning of the Beatles' later era) of the Fab Four.    Highly recommended. Buy the album, put it on, turn off your mind, relax, and float downstream. Let the Beatles take you on a journey.

My only recourse is to wear out this DVD set, which I do.  I watch it often.  This was a great show, and a great story, topped off by a very good movie, Serenity.  I would love to see another show or movie done in the Firefly universe.  I also have to say that Summer Glau is just an awesome actress and I'll watch whatever movie she is in next.
B000EDWL82|4.0|the more you listen to this cd the better it gets. it will sink in,just give it time !
B0000019PA|5.0|Nine years have not diminished the power of this album; in fact, it sounds remarkably ahead of its time for 1997- anticipates more recent hot indy rock, e.g. the Arcade Fire.     King of Carrot Flowers Pt. 1 and Aeroplane Over the Sea are beautiful, short, poignant tracks. The two quirky instrumental tracks on this album are also very nice. Oh, Comely is an intensely haunting 8+ minute track that will make the hairs raise on the back of your neck.     The melodies are complex; a couple of listens through the album and you'll be hearing it in your dreams. The singing is not skilled in a conventional sense, but his voice contains raw emotional power. The songs focus on themes of escapist time-travel fantasizing done by a teenager trapped in an abusive family in a trailer park. Overall, a mesmerizing, haunting album.
B0002UOK04|5.0|Wintersun started as Jari M&auml;enp&auml;&auml;, the former frontman of Ensiferum, left the band to pursue his musical vision of Wintersun. Many fans, including myself, mourned the loss of Jari from Ensiferum, but after listening to this beautiful debut release, I can only be joyful in Jari's brilliance at making wonderful melodic northern metal.<br /><br />'Beyond the Dark Sun' is a short, but fast opener. Jari's screams are very good here and throughout the album. 'Sleeping Stars' is a great melodic viking-esque song with supurb guitar playing. 'Battle Against Time' will take the listener away to the frozen winters of northern Finland. 'Death and the Healing' is a beautiful song, more of a balland that sounds a lot like an Iron Maiden song with the leads. The closer, 'Sadness and Hate' is my favorite song on the album. Do not let this 10 minute song fool you. It is not boring and has many viking elements as Jari's vocals truly shine.<br /><br />Many fans might have envisioned Wintersun's music similar to Ensiferum. This is not the case at all. Personally, I would have not minded another viking/folk metal album, but Jari M&auml;enp&auml;&auml; took his vision to viking/melodic metal with hints of black metal. This debut album was a very high point of 2004, and pathos is used well in Wintersun's compositions. Jari M&auml;enp&auml;&auml; is currently in the studio, and a new album will be in our hands in the near future. This is what beautiful northern music sounds like. \M/
B000G75AE8|1.0|Being a long time Slayer fan since the early 80's, Slayer has really disappointed me recently, with all the lies, being hypricates, everything else. <br /> <br />As For Christ Illusion-MAJOR DISAPOINTMENT!!!!!!!!..There is nothing good on this cd. Kerry/Jeff need to take guitar lessons. The riffs/songs are all recycled some really weird riffs. Besides the new Iron Maiden this will be the 2nd worst cd of 06 <br /> <br />Slayer really needs to start going on tour with some real metal bands. All this Nu-Metal bands they take out with them is embarrassing. They are starting to sound like them. <br /> <br />I was really excited when I heard Dave was back in the band, going to record the new Slayer album, but his performance is also disappointing. <br /> <br />If you are just getting into Slayer, buy anything up till Seasons, after that it is GAYER. <br /> <br />Can't wait till Slayer do their show with Stryper...Way to go guys....... <br /> <br />RIP SLAYER...RETIRE PLEASE <br />
1416524800|5.0|I have read many reviews saying this book doesn't live up to Brown's other thrillers, but believe me, it does. First, it is extremely well researched. Reading it is like looking into the inner workings of NASA, American politics, and secret government agencies. Brown has obviously done his homework, as \\"Deception Point\\" contains in-depth descriptions of secret American army weapons, new advanced technologies I had no clue existed, and scientific explanations and terms that I would expect to come from the mouths of astrophysicists, not a mainstream thriller author.<br />Second, you actually care about what happens to the characters in the story. Unlike some other thrillers I have read, Brown actually takes time to develop his characters, but the traits that you discover about them fit in with the plot and the events in the story. Another factor is the fact that the characters have feelings and tendencies that you can relate to, ex. fear of water and long-term grief over a lost love one. Since we can relate to the characters, we root for the good ones and hate the bad ones, making \\"Deception Point\\" a fun book to read.<br />Okay, here's the plot:<br />It is almost time for the election and President Zach Herney is getting nervous. His rival, Senator Sedgewick Sexton, is destroying him in the polls, all because Sexton is bashing NASA about it's huge budget, inefficient practices, and monoploly of space. NASA is indeed floundering, as most of its projects are over-budget, don't work correctly, and hindering to other government agencies that rely on NASA's technologies. But suddenly NASA makes an extraordinary discovery: a meteorite full of fossils of extra-terrestrial creatures buried deep in the arctic ice, proving that there is life on other planets. Enter NRO intelligence liason Rachel Sexton (the daughter of Senator Sexton), and Michael Tolland, host of a popular TV documentary show about the ocean. They, and several other civilian scientists, are brought in to verify the authenticy of the meteorite for the public, as the president doesn't want to have rumours surface that the meteorite is a hoax to save NASA. What Rachel and Michael discover is unthinkable, evidence of a complex conspiracy that threatens to create a huge controversy that would effect the very course of the election. Before they can warn the president, however, they are attacked by a team of assasins, controlled by a mysterious person who wants any evidence of a conspiracy covered up. Meanwhile, back in Wahington D.C, Gabrielle Ashe, assistant to Senator Sexton, discovers proof that her canidate is not as trustworthy or law abiding as he seems, and she begins to find evidence suggesting he is taking illegal bribes from private space agencies. It could have turned into a confusing mess, but Brown ties up all the loose ends, and by the end all the pieces of the puzzle fall into place, making \\"Deception Point\\" a thrilling read, full of cliff-hangers, surprises, and suspense.enticy of the meteorite for the public, as the president doesn't want to have rumours surface that the meteorite is a hoax to save NASA.

0780020685|5.0|I'm an avid fan of Akira Kurosawa, and to see one of his greatest works 'Shichinin no Samurai', really put a smile on my face. The timeless classic about seven samurai hired to protect a small village was a remarkable and uplifting premise for the action genre. The cast of samurai in the film is vivid. Also, noting that Akira created each characters with their own traits was a very good idea. Instead of having stiff, drab heroes, Akira managed to make every character distinguished.<br /><br />The 3-hour spectacle showcases truly magestic direction, a captivating plot and an epic journey of assembling. The movie's pace is perfect. Every single scene plays better than the last and has a motive. Though I would've loved to see each character's flashback, I know this wouldn't occur as Kurosawa was a strong follower of the chronological devlopment of his stories post Rashomon.<br /><br />The final scenes are the most important. There, we see Kambei Shimada, the leader of the seven samurai strategizing. The fear of the villagers and farmers are what makes this epic 16th century tale powerful. This film tells the simple tale of humanity and morals. It's awe-inspiring and set the standards for many films that came out in later years.<br /><br />Akira Kurosawa really gave everybody a genuine classic. Reuniting with Toshiro Mifune, the star of his second most successful film Rashomon wasn't only a reason for fans to watch Seven Samurai, but this is proabaly the first film in which anyone has given each character their own individual traits. From the tight-lipped, non-chalant Kyuzo to the tumultuous and humorous Kikuchiyo, Seven Samurai is a feast for the eyes.<br /><br />Ground-breaking action, powerful acting and stunning direction makes this a must-see. To say this is a great film is an understatement. It is the most recommendable film after City of God.
B000H7JCG4|4.0|All I can say is God Bless Shannen Doherty. I lovingly refer to the only good seasons as \\"The Brenda Years\\".   I trace my entire youth by the career of Shannen. Thank You.
B000ETRCMQ|5.0|At first, I had doubts about watching this film due to its weak storyline that has been done before. But I decided to watch it for the very fact of Felicity Huffman's preformance. The film isn't anything special - almost a heartwarming road movie. The preformances are what to consider. Transamerica showcases probably the best female preformance so far.<br /><br />The film's stark beginning is a turn off, yes - but it gradually changes into a sentimental film. 9/10.
B000EQ47GS|5.0|One word describes this cd: AWESOME!!!!!!!! Buy this cd and you will not regret it.
B000000Y87|3.0|this CD arranges the songs the way it does.  I love the sounds, the jazz, the piano, the bass, yeah all of that stuff is good and all, but why do I have to hear the same song twice in a row multiple times? Explain to me why there shouldn't be the six differnt songs (by title) and then the four repeats tacked onto the end so as to excite a \\"Wow, yeah that was a great song, I don't mind hearing it again\\" instead of a \\"I just heard that song?\\" <br /> <br />I reccommend getting a recording that doesn't do this. There are many versions of the music created on this legendary day.
B000G75AE8|5.0|Finally, a Slayer album worthy of Slayer and Slayer fans.  \\"God Hates Us All\\" was very good, but efforts before it were subpar.  Christ Illusion returns the band to former glory.  There are many moments here which recall the Slayer of \\"Reign in Blood\\" through \\"Seasons in the Abyss\\"... but that's a very good thing.  There are also hints of Hanneman's punk influence, Tom's great distinctive vocals (no grunt/shout), the expected controversial lyrics, and Dave Lombardo... which needs no further comment.  My favorite songs here are Skeleton Christ, Jihad, Flesh Storm, and Supremist.  The only weak link it \\"Eyes of the Insane\\", which is still better than most \\"metal\\" bands spew out these days.  All in all, a great cd... but it's too short (38 minutes... arghhh!!!!). <br /> <br />An interesting side note is that King played all of the rhythms on the cd, using Hanneman's guitars and amps to play his parts (Guitar World Sep 2006). <br /> <br />The only place you'll find music as heavy and with as much attitude is on a BLS cd, and with all due respect to Zakk Wylde, whom I love, Slayer is on another level all together.
B00005JOYA|3.0|The games are incredible, so I was expecting great things from this. I was rather disappointed. Yeah, there are some great moments - the scene with Pyramid Head on the steps outside the church is just so cool - but on the whole it's more a film with the atmosphere and the promise to deliver than one that actually comes through. Pity. It's probably better on a second viewing, once you know it isn't going to be a gore fest of monster killing, so you can appreciate the wonderful sets and atmosphere, which get overlooked while you're waiting for the shooting to begin.  <br /> <br />When you think of game-to-movie adaptations like Streetfighter, Super Mario, or even Doom, this is a superb piece of cinema... but when you think of the Silent Hill games... well, there's just so much action missing. Okay, it's a difficult scenario to plot - how does Average Joe take on a heap load of monsters by constantly stumbling into bigger and better weaponry and extra ammo, but that's what the game is. Yeah, the game's atmospheric, but primarily, it's about blasting the hell out of monsters. On that level, the movie strikes out totally. Still, it's a good effort.  <br /> <br />If there's a sequel, I'd like more action.  <br /> <br />If your bags atmosphere as opposed to stuff actually happening, you'll love this. If you think Doom deserved Oscars, I'd look elsewhere.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|The mystery being why this brilliant series was cancelled after one run, and why the film sequel \\"Serenity\\" wasn't the highest-grossing movie of 2005. Joss Whedon, of \\"Toy Story\\" & \\"Buffy\\" fame has surpassed both with this superbly written and acted programme. As before it's Whedon's ability to create intriguing and entertaining characters that puts this ahead of the rest of TV (except perhaps NYPD Blue!). Frequently hilarious, always exhilarating - but please, please watch \\"Firefly\\" before \\"Serenity\\".
0385334176|5.0|To my way of thinking Kurt Vonnegut is one of the greatest writers of all time, end of story. I've yet to read anything bad by him -- and even a subpar offering from him is leaps and bounds better than most other books out there. This is great for Vonnegut and the reader, but is most fortunate for Deadeye Dick because while it falls (just barely) into the category of lesser Vonnegut it is still a truly great book and a tour de force of creative writing. In its pages you will meet Rudy Waltz, a pharmacist and so-called neuter who has been hiding away from the world ever since he accidentally shot and killed a pregnant woman at twelve years old and became a double murderer known in town as Deadeye Dick. In typical Vonnegut style Waltz has a fascinating and unique way of looking at the world and telling his story, and is backed up with an endearingly eccentric cast of characters. His outrageous father is one of Vonnegut's best creations: a self-proclaimed artist with no talent or artwork, an utter narcissist and onetime friend of Hitler's who becomes a laughingstock after the outbreak of WWII because he had so ardently supported his friend without actually paying attention to his politics. So why does Deadeye Dick fail to join the pantheon of Vonnegut's greats like Slaughterhouse Five, Mother Night, and Breakfast of Champions? Because those three have a moral urgency to them that Deadeye Dick is just slightly lacking in some key parts. While it is certainly not difficult to get involved in Waltz's saga I couldn't help but wish that he had come to more definitive conclusions in the end. But it does have a killer last line, and I would highly recommend this novel to anyone familiar with Vonnegut or, especially, to anyone who has yet to experience his divine fiction.
630460291X|1.0|I can't reccommend Robin Hood because my NEW movie has scratches in it, and will only play to a certain point, and then just stops. <br />Be careful when you buy DVD's from Amazon. I bought \\"new\\", so how could it be scratched?
B0002W4SWC|5.0|Unlike most movies, Renee Zellweiger is not made up to the 9's in this fabulous film.  She looks like a typical woman on a typical day and it's believable enough to mimic reality, but not so close that you just get depressed over it.  This movie is a don't miss title!
B000ETQRCM|1.0|It's seriously funny to read these reviews.  \\"we all wish we were back in the dorm room passing around that special substance and listening to Pearl Jam\\".  That special something was probably what made PJ sound so good.  There are those of us who are admitted metal heads and yes we were disenfranchised during the 90's and yes we even tried PJ back in the day.  Didn't like it then so I thought I would be open minded and give 'em another chance.  Don't like them now.  Yes, they are seriously overrated.  Sadly, there aren't any new bands willing to grab the rock throne (I won't use metal here because that would be a disgrace much like the Jethro Tull awards fiasco) so I think people flock to things that are memorable.  Kicking back in the dorm room, toking, and feeling miserable.  yep, that was the old musical edge for PJ.  Feed off teenage angst.  Well, PJ has targetted the same old fanbase but with a new edge.  Now, there music has more to do with adolescent libbie-yuppie smugness which is popular at the moment.  The bottom line is that they are great marketing guys with little talent and yes, loved the comparisons to Eddy's voice as a \\"growling monkey\\" and \\"a bottle cap stuck in a grabage disposal\\".  Someone please BRING BACK REAL ROCK ATTITUDE!!!
B000EOTAM6|2.0|I'll start by saying I'm a huge fan of Charlize Theron's work. However, I can't imagine why she took this role. Charlize's light is hidden under the bushel of a director who evidently thinks a story can be told without requiring any emotion from the characters. Aeon (Theron) and all the other main characters are flat and awfully boring. The simplistic story about the evils of cloning seems much longer than its 92 minutes. The fight sequences are heavily edited, just so much smoke and shadow -- no real martial arts expertise. Skip Aeon Flux and give Ultraviolet a try. That is a much more creative film.
B000F0UV0E|5.0|The pairing of Mark Knopfler and Emmylou Harris on All the Roadrunning is a marriage made in heaven. From the mildly suggestive Red Staggerwing to the heart-felt This Is Us, this collaboration works! The title cut refers to the wall of death motorcycle riders but is also a metaphor for life. <br /> <br />Love and Happiness for You is one of the greatest love songs ever. The vocal harmonies and counter-points are excellent on all the cuts. I find myself cranking in up on almost every song. <br /> <br />Overall, All the Roadrunning is destined to be one of my all time favorites. <br /> <br />Ed Aslinger
B000G75AE8|5.0|SLAYER - Christ Illusion  -  Within seconds of `Flesh Storm' it was clear that Lombardo was back behind the kit and not only as competent as his last studio album with Slayer (Seasons in the Abyss) but had actually raised the bar.  Truthfully I loved Bostaph... I was sold from the `Killing Fields' intro and was quite sad to hear of his departure from the band. With all the hype of Lombardo coming back I was thinking this album would just be another `standard' modern Slayer album... Boy was I wrong! Lombardo used his time away from Slayer to become better grounded and gained much more `groove' in addition to his fantastic speed/thrash abilities. Playing with such greats as Fantomas (With Mike Patton), John Zorn and even Apocalyptica.     Christ Illusion is easily the most consistent album since `Seasons...' with not one bad song to be heard. Though Slayer may never again rival the Reign / South / Season Trilogy that does not make this a bad album by any means and to be putting out music this good (And this heavy!) after almost 25 years is a grand achievement by all rights.     In addition to the fantastic drumming of Lombardo, there is the skillful guitar work of King and Hanneman whose performances are amazing as always. Araya's voice is holding out quite well for a man his age and his Bass playing tight as hell!     Favorite Songs: Cult, Jihad, Supremist and Consfearacy  -4.5 Stars     IF YOU LIKED, AGREED OR APPRECIATED THIS. PLEASE CLICK YES FOR:   \\"Was this review helpful?\\"
B00008H2LB|4.0|I DISCOVERED LINKIN PARK BY ACCIDENT WHEN I WAS AT WAL-MART. I BOUGHT IT THINKING IT WAS A SOUNDTRACK TO A GAME OR ANIME AND I ONLY COME HOME TO FIND THIS OUT THAT I WAS WRONG. I DON'T LISTEN TO ROCK UNLESS IT'S JAPANESE, MAINLY BECAUSE I LISTEN TO TECHNO AND JAZZ. NOW I'M A FAIR WEATHER LISTENER. <br /> <br /> 'EASIER TO RUN' SOUNDS LIKE IN THE END MORE THAN I LIKE IT TOO. OTHERWISE IT'S OK.
B000F0UV0E|5.0|This is one of those rare cds where there is nary a bad track.  Every song is wonderful and the album as a whole is a masterpiece.  My friend and I are always griping \\"What has happened to music? Remember when mainstream music consisted of beautiful songs with melody & harmony like back in the 70s (and earlier)?  What happened?\\"  I rarely buy new albums but being a fan of these two great talents I decided to give this one a try.  It has instantly become on of my favorite albums and, like another reviewer said, it is destined to become a classic.  One extra special song on this album is the song \\"If This is Goodbye\\".  Once you know what it is about, try listening to it with a dry eye!  I can't.  This song can take me out of even my worst mood and make me think about what is important in life.  It is a fine tribute to the heroes of United Flight 93 and a beautiful love song.  Thank you Mark & Emmylou for such a great album!  I give it five stars (because that is the most they allow :) ) and a standing ovation!  I hope it wins a ton of grammys!
B000069CWE|1.0|LINKIN PARK IS AN OK BAND, I MERELY SAY OK BECAUSE OF THE DAMN RAPPERS SCREWING UP THE SONGS SO BADLY YOU ALMOST WANT TO HATE THE ORIGINALS AS WELL. WHY CAN'T PEOPLE GET IT THROUGH THEIR THICK HEADS THAT RAP MAKES ALL MUSIC CRAPPY?! I HOPE YOU LEARNED YOUR LESSON LINKIN PARK!
B0000009RX|5.0|I notice that some reviewers here are offended that Frank Zappa & the M.O.I. would dare mock the Beatles. I don't think the Beatles minded too much, why should fans? I would rather listen to this than Sgt. Pepper anyday, and I grew up on the Beatles [although this album and Magical Mystery Tour would be neck and neck for me].  <br />Others try to be cute and dismiss Zappa as pretentious. Please, graduate from high school, people. Listen to the music, not your objections.  <br />Musically, this is a solid record with quite a few beautiful cuts. It is one of the top albums of the rock era, certainly one of the best from that year. Try it. Wear headphones so you don't miss anything.  <br />
B00005JNTX|4.0|I enjoyed Sin City, but I didn't think it was a \\"great\\" movie. Yes, the visual style was really innovative. And the dialog was often funny, in a Mickey Spillane kind of way. Mickey Rourke is the standout among the cast.  And I really loved the music. Great, moody jazz!  But the storylines were muddled and the characters were beyond stereotypes. And it didn't really need to be two hours long. So overall, I'll give it a rating of 4 stars.
B000A7Q2DM|4.0|I really don't listen to newer music that much, but I heard about 30 Seconds to Mars for the same reason that most people heard of them. Actor Jared Leto (Alexander, Requiem for a Dream, Lord of War, etc.) is the lead singer. Most actors who cross over to singing, if any do, they rarely pick the rock genre. They usually lean towards pop/hip-hop kind of stuff, so I was already kind of impressed. And if they do cross over to the rock genre, most aren't the vocalist (case in point; Keanu Reeves plays bass in Dogstarr) I saw Leto on Jimmy Kimmel a couple months ago, where he talked about coming to California to be a musician and had fallen into acting. So, he's not an actor turning into a musician. He's a musician, who became an actor who's returning to what he loves. I was intrigued. Having never heard any of their songs (odd, since I've seen the video for The Kill countless times on TV since I bought the CD) I went and bought this CD; I listened to it once and didn't like it that much. For me, I had to listen to it a few more times before the songs sank in. First I want to say, I think the best song on the album is The Kill. So, if you're going to listen to the album don't expect any songs to top that one. The band has talent; Drummer Shannon Leto (Jared's brother) is talented, guitarist Tomo Milicevic is really good, and bassist Matt Wachter has a few good basslines here and there. Then there's Jared Leto. He's a damned good vocalist; He has a very unique voice and he can change his voice to fit the mood of the song. He can sing really low, he can scream, he can belt it out; Great voice. He writes all the songs and he's got some good lyrics (nothing outstanding, but good). There's no songs on here that are bad; I didn't hate any of the songs on here. But that doesn't mean the album is that good. It has it's great songs (The Kill, The Fantasy, and Savior), it's borderline great songs (Attack, Was It a Dream), and then it has it's less-than-spectacular songs (A Beautiful Lie, The Story, etc.). The band has a lot of talent and they'd probably put on a great live show...If they continue releasing records, then a great Best Of collection may be in their future; But this CD is borderline mediocre. Look in the used section, or be sure that you like the songs I don't like, before paying too much for the CD. Here's a little more in depth review of all the tracks: <br /> <br />1. Attack-5/5-The whole song is good, but the chorus is the best part of the song. The guitar playing on this song is really good. <br />2. A Beautiful Lie-4/5-This song is less than spectacular. The lyrics are good, but the song lacks...Catchiness. <br />3. The Kill-5/5-I know this is the albums single and saying it's the best song on here is kind of lame. But...This is the best song on here. It's catchy, the music is great, Jared's lyrics are absolutely great. His voice sounds really good on here too. <br />4. Was It a Dream?-5/5-I like this song, but I don't like the chorus that much. <br />5. The Fantasy-5/5-This song is another one of the songs I like. It's really good. <br />6. Savior-5/5-This is probably the 2nd best song on the album. <br />7. From Yesterday-4/5-Thought-provoking lyrics don't make this a great song, it doesn't even really make it a good song. It makes it an OK song. <br />8. The Story-3/5-It's not really a bad song, in the typical sense. It just never picks up, it's the track you skip past when you listen to an album. <br />9. R Evolve-4/5-Again, not really a good song. It's better than the last two tracks, but it's still pretty weak. <br />10. A Modern Myth-4/5-This song plays for about two minutes and then there's just empty track space for like 8 minutes. The song is OK. <br />11. Bonus Track-5/5-This bonus track really isn't bad. Leto does some unnessary screaming, but even that's kinda cool. <br />12. Bonus Track-4/5-They do this song better than Bjork, but still... <br /> <br />GRADE: B- <br />
B00005R23X|5.0|I've read some of the reviews listed here.Many make fun of the movie.Gee, they must all be \\"Freddy\\" or \\"Friday the 13th\\" fans!Granted, Keannu Reeves was the wrong choice for J.Harker.His acting being stiff and dull.But, the rest of the movie is great!Gary Oldmans performance is outstanding! This movie is a love story. I have read Mr.Stokers book 2 times. This movie is the closest rendition given in accordance to the written word! It may not be verbatum, but it works! If you like Dracula flicks and you like a good romance, this movie is for you. When Prince Vlad meets Mina, he tells her \\"I have crossed oceans of time (to find you).\\" AHHH...true love!

B000G73UEU|5.0|All but one of these songs is a cover version. Leonard sings only at the very end, his gravelly golden voice perched perfectly there at the top of the incredible tower of song that is this soundtrack . Antony's mid-CD rendition of \\"If it be your will\\" is unimaginably, breathtakingly poignant. Rufus Wainwright's \\"Chelsea Hotel\\" is intoxicating, and Martha Wainwright's delivers an excellent version of \\"The Traitor\\". Beth Orton's \\"Sisters of Mercy\\" didn't quite do it for me, but the other songs are thoroughly unmissable. His woeful but gloriously uplifting poetry has been superbly captured on this CD.
0671015206|2.0|The book gives lots of interesting statistics about millionaires vs. non-millionaires at similar income levels, but basically repeats one concept paragraph after paragraph, page after page:  People with high wealth have high income that they spend thriftily and invest well, while high wager earners with lower wealth than they should have spend outrageously on luxuries...what a surprise!  For a chapter or two that might be an interesting theme, but this is almost the entirety of what the book has to say about \\"millionaires.\\"  There's a few useful tidbits about how these millionaires actually manage to be thrifty, but nothing too groundbreaking. A ten page version of this book could serve an identical function to its 300+ pages of rambling and statistics.
006056251X|5.0|Loved 'Dreaming Of You'? or Do you have a soft spot for reformed rakes? Then this is the book for you!<br /><br />Shy stuttering heroine, Evie, has a problem and her solution is to offer marriage to one of the most lecherous men in London. The heiress is desperate to get away from her physically abusive relatives, who attempt to force her into marriage with a cousin by any means neccessary in order to obtain her fortune. Thus, Evie has to make a deal with the devil -Sebastian, Viscount St. Vincent. Offer herself and her fortune in exchange for safety.<br /><br />Sebastian cannot believe who has called upon his bachelor residence and the proposal she makes. Its a win-win for him. He gains her fortune, gets to consummate the marriage and is free to continue in lecherous ways while she leaves to start her own independant life.<br /><br />Only things don't actually turn out that way. Sebastion has to deal with his new acquirement -a gambling hell, which is being sponged by dishonest empoyees and is run-down. Violence erupts everywhere, Evie's relatives come a calling and someone wants Sebastion and/or Evie dead. Sebastion is also plagued by the usual clenching of his heart whenever Evie is around and the fury he feels when she smiles at someone else.<br /><br />I loved the way these two fell in love. It sort of snuck-up-from-behind them. Many tender scenes.<br /><br />Great addition to the Wallflower series. Get it. You won't regret it. It stands on its own, but I do recommend you read the others in the series. I read this one first and I'm glad. I don't know if I would have loved Sebastion as much if I read It Happened One Autumn first, he's the villian.
B00005JKN9|1.0|Scorsese is great when he sticks to historical realism, but this absurd fantasy looks like a cross between the Keystone Cops and Monty Python, with lots of Sam Peckinpah blood thrown in.  It's not funny, it's not dramatic, it's not believable, it's not clever, it's not exciting, but it is totally ludicrous.  However, it takes itself so seriously that you can't even laugh at it. <br /> <br />Leonardo DiCrappio gives another crappy performance.  He really is a one-note actor, and his attempt at an Irish accent is pathetic.   <br /> <br />I'm a fan of Scorsese, but I turned off this turd after 30 minutes. <br /> <br />Those people who think this is a great film can keep the Jim Jones Kool-Ade to themselves;  I'm not drinking it.
B000E0WJIC|3.0|I'm tired of metalheads.  I'm tired of name-dropping people who think that because they listen to something that somehow defies trends (Although black metal is the most formulaic form of music out there, anyone who says no has no idea) when in fact there are very very few bands that can and do defy trends.  I hate to name drop, but some of the best in heavy music for the past few years have been Candiria, Maudlin of the Well, Converge, Mr Bungle (sort of heavy, not really), and Between the Buried and Me.  I listen to all of these guys, but I also enjoy more mainstream acts as well.  I also enjoy how people rip on metalcores \\"visual appearance\\" when most underground metal has the most strikingly ridiculous costumes, complete with norse armor and weaponry, lame vampiric get ups, fake blood, and an overabundance in clothing that is straight out of slasher flicks from the 1970's.   <br /> <br />You can listen to the innovators, the Mastodons and the Gigantic Brains of the world, but listening to other things is not forbidden, nor is it bad.  Especially not when \\"pop\\" music has such a technical edge to it, I find it refreshing that the trendiest music on the radio requires its artists to have some chops.  You'd figure the underground metalheads would at least be a little satisfied it isn't nu metal anymore (and it's not, stop calling it that), but they're never satisfied.  If what they like becomes popular, they complain, and then find something new to latch on to, whine that people are stupid for not getting it, and then when people do get it they disown it immediately. <br /> <br />Anyway, on to the album.  Bullet for my Valentine is another in a glut of albums I've been listening to from the metalcore sect (including Assie rockers Parkway Drive and the new Unearth) and this is by far the better of the 3.  The playing is tight, the riffs are nice and cleanly done, the songwriting however is a bit formulaic.  Basically, if you've heard Hand of Blood or Tears Don't Fall,don't expect many surprises from this release.  Again, the album might not set the world on fire, but it's not bad by any means.   <br /> <br />To all those reading this review, if you're a rabid fan of Unearth or Killswitch, be sure this is on your list.  It's quite good.  It isn't, however, the seminal metalcore album.  That already came out last year, it's called Constitution of Treason by God Forbid, and is easily one of the best straight metal albums I've heard in a long long time.
B00005JOML|4.0|A sting gone bad, resulting in many deaths leads to Miami cops Sonny Crockett (Farrell) and Rico Tubbs (Foxx) going undercover  to find the leak in the FBI.  Under the guise of transportation experts, they meet up with drug smuggler Jose Yero (Ortiz) and his associate Isabella (Li).  Crockett and Tubbs want to take over as Yero's distributors, handling all their shipments to the United States.  Yero is suspicious, but takes them on, with Isabella as the go-between.<br /><br />\\"Miami Vice\\" is a movie that probably did not need to be made, but unlike other TV shows that have been made into movies, \\"Miami Vice\\" has a quality director that was involved with the original material as a producer.  That is what brings the film to the next level.  Mann has taken the idea from the TV show and transformed it into a grittier, more realistic version of itself.  Indeed, aside from the character names, there is little similarities to the TV show.  Farrell and Foxx are good as Crockett and Tubbs, two big sets of shoes to fill.  The story is tight and at times very violent.  The look is dark, and that suits the film just fine - atmosphere is almost a character itself.  I could even see this film spawning a sequel or two.  \\"Miami Vice\\" is not for everyone, but it is an above average cop film that is worth checking out.
B000BTC5LW|4.0|Well, if you're here reading this now, you probably know what Pink Floyd is about and/or have already seen this performance in one form or another, so I'm going to focus my review on the technical aspects of the DVD. <br /> <br />First off, the picture quality.  The DVD shows a marked improvement over the VHS recording in clarity and resolution; the image is still fairly grainy, (though, that's to be expected in a low-light environment... except when their blinding light show is giving the audience an artificial suntan, of course) but overall the picutre is fairly good.  It comes in a 4:3 aspect ratio only - and while I don't know if they used the equipment back in '94 to present this in widescreen, it's less about the picture than it is the sound, right? <br /> <br />Right, the sound -  I own a couple of other DVD releases by Columbia music, and my expectations, especially for a show of this caliber, were fairly lofty, and unfortunately, this release fell short of that mark. <br /> <br />There are three audio options - a 441kbps Dolby Digital 5.1 track, a 640kbps Dolby Digital 5.1 track, and a 441kbps Dolby Stereo track.  A 1440 or 1536kbps LPCM track was what I was expecting the core of this release to be played on - a DTS track would have been nice (if unnecessary), but the lack of a lossless track is just mind boggling to me.  So, I made due with what was there, and started into the stereo mix.  Playing around with it a bit, I found that they throw a lot of the sound back to the rear channels in the surround mixes, so I tried the 640kbps mix.  There's even more bad news here - the volume level is constantly dropping and returning as sound is being panned across the channels (and I tested this on surround headphones too to make sure I wasn't going crazy), which got extremely annoying about 20 minutes into the disc.  The 441kbps mix's volume fluctuations were less drastic, however still audible. <br /> <br />Volume problems aside, the mix is slightly above average.  The width and depth presented here aren't awe inspriting, and the instruments just don't \\"pop.\\"  The color of the saxophone during Dark Side doesn't come through with all the shine and sting you would expect from the instrument, the bass guitar is bloated, and the mix sometimes sends superfluous data to the subwoofer channel resulting in an occasional misplaced boom. <br /> <br />Those points aside - did I write this review to tell you not to buy it?  Well, no.  I went to see them live when the tour came to my state, I bought the VHS, and I also bought the DVD, and still managed to enjoy it.  Whether it warrants a purchase or not is really left up to what you're looking to get.

B0002Z9HT8|4.0|Even though this set has 4 dvds, it's really chopped up and feels incomplete. Some of this I know is a result of technical difficulties (such as The Who still playing while the broadcast was disconnected), but there are songs I specifically remember, and looking forward to seeing. I was very disappointed to not have the complete concert, or complete sets from bands (and no Led Zeppelin!?!?! c'mon man). <br />It's still a landmark concert, The set from Queen was amazing, and the proceeds go to a good cause, but that doesn't mean that I'm not disappointed. When will the COMPLETE DVD come out?

B00004VXF2|3.0|Difficult? . . . Yes.  Acquired taste? . . . Definitely.    It is understandable if you don't like this, it's pretty much  nothing but an hour of feedback.  However insulting those who can actually appreciate this is rude, narrow minded and downright mean spirited.      Just because you don't like it doesn't mean that it's tripe or that those who do appreciate it are pseudo-intellectuals who think they're cool and different because they're listening to something that is so uncommercial and unmarketable.  Why are people so hard pressed to believe that there are people out there who really do like this based on its merits alone?      Noise as music isn't a new thing at all. In the 5o's John Cage built a career and a philosophy around it.  Even more recent artists are doing the same.  Check out Oval whose's CDs are nothing more that 45 minutes of arrhythmic static and skips that sound as if a blender ate your CD player.  Even at a My Bloody Valentine live gig they broke out into a 20 minute session of nothing but feedback.  Perhaps an homage to Reed.    If you don't like it, you don't have to like it but don't put down those who do.
0446614459|3.0|This was a really interesting story.  Wonderful political plot with endless possibilities as to who the true villan might be.  Once I got toward the end and the villan and his motives were revealed, what a bummer!  This was lame, lame, lame.  Is that the best he could do?  Not at the top of my most recommended reads for the summer!
B00004Y6O7|5.0|After Women and Children first, Van Halen knew they had to make a definite music decision: return back to the upbeat pop-influenced sound of their first two albums, or continue the less structed, more open approach of Women and Children First?  The latter path was the eventual conclusion after Eddie voiced dissatisfaction at being held back on musical direction.  The result was a more rockish album, the lyrics dealt with matters similar to the first three but did so in a format that fit more with the band's live show and not their pop sensibilities.<br /><br />The list:<br /><br />1.Mean Street (4:55): The meanest EVH guitar opener with the pulling handtapping technique that produces a very unique sound effect (he fingertaps and whilst moving his hand up and down the fretboard).  Shortly after follows one of Van Halen's darkest riffs followed by a funk element?  One of the harder staples in the VH catalogue.<br /><br />2.\\"Dirty Movies\\" (4:08): Obvious synth work from Eddie throughout, a very dark sound scape is present although the subject manner is very light (its about a girl who becomes a porn star after high school and the effect it has on her hometown).<br /><br />3.Sinner's Swing! (3:08): An exclamatory song!  The only time you hear the words \\"Sinners Swing!\\" is at the very beginning of the song.  Warning: Dave drops the f-bomb on the virst virse, which is friggn unnecessary on a Van Halen recrod.  Otherwise the song is great: I think it is about a guy trying to get with some chick and she keeps brushing him off and about how if you want someone keep trying, no matter what.<br /><br />4.Hear About it Later (4:33): Van Halen's darkest song is about not worrying about the future, for it takes care of itself; that is what I gather from the lyrics, which jump from one event to another.  One of Eddie's most creative guitar solos takes mainstage.<br /><br />5.Unchained (3:27): Kind of has the same sound as \\"Mean Street\\" and \\"Sinners Swing!\\" but more commercialized.  One of Dave's most creative one-liners is present: \\" Woo-hoo! Take a look at this!<br /><br />Hey man, that suit is you!<br /><br />Whoo-whee! You'll get some leg tonight for sure!<br /><br />Tell us how you do! Hoo hoo hoo!<br /><br />(Come on Dave, gimme a break)<br /><br />Hey hey hey hey! One break, comin' up!\\"  Very original.  The song is about life being Unchained, nothing stays the same (dur!).<br /><br />6.Push Comes to Shove (3:48): Oh wait!  There is a pop-influenced song on this album.  There is an omnipresent bass line throughout with a little guitar whine here and there.  A big break from the first 5 rockers on here.<br /><br />7.So This is Love? (3:05): A classic example of how combining different music styles into one can create a superior sound.  Starts of with a light intro that is easy listening into a guitar driven conclusion.<br /><br />8.Sunday Afternoon in the Park (2:00): A keyboard instrumental that is pretty heavy.  Van Halen is one band that is noted for turning a keyboard into a metal weapon, and still make it sound good.  This track has to be one of the heaviest instrumentals that use only a keyboard.<br /><br />9.One Foot Out the Door (1:56): A very short song that is about Dave having to bolt out of some ladies house after her husband shows up out of nowhere and the escape.  Could be considered Van Halen's \\"Paranoid\\" due to the short song length (how many songs do you know are in the 1:00-2:00 range and have actual lyrics and song structure?) and the intense furiosity of the band.  Maybe Van Halen's most intense song ever.<br /><br />The greatest Van Halen album ever:<br /><br />1.Fair Warning<br /><br />2.Women and Children First<br /><br />3.Van Halen<br /><br />4.1984<br /><br />5.Van Halen II<br /><br />6.Balance<br /><br />7.5150<br /><br />8.OU812<br /><br />9.Diver Down<br /><br />10.For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge<br /><br />11.Live: Right Here, Right Now<br /><br />12.Van Halen 3ative one-liners is present: \\" Woo-hoo!

B00005JOQS|3.0|Plainly put...the casting was poor...the plot was very poorly written, and I miss the superman who was all man!  Christopher Reeve was tall, sexy, and masculine.  This superman could have be a gay male, and have been believable.
B00004Y6OA|5.0|Any normal sane person would assume that after VHII that Van Halen would go in a pop direction. Sister, you are wayyyy wrong! Instead Van Halen divides up the styles like a musicapollaza all on one album: heavy metal, speed metal, blues-infused rock, cajun style to \\"lalalalalalalaolalala!\\" Their most diverse outing thus far.<br /><br />Track listing:<br /><br />1.Cradle Will Rock....(3:31): Song has a ton of band comments during it (\\"ya could've at least faked it boy,\\" backup: \\"faked it boy\\"; \\"have you seen junior's grades\\"). And according to Van Halen this is the first song that Eddie used a keyboard on to create a heavy guitar effect (wha?). The definition of heavy.<br /><br />2.Everybody Wants Some!!(5:05): Heavy environment sound: Monkeys, distant guitar sound coming closer than the \\"ahha!\\" classic VH. Some more comments (\\"hey man, where did you get that  ?\\" \\"I alway liked those kind of high heels\\") with a few almost inaudible curse words thrown in just to see if you can hear them. Eddie's sound has definitely changed, it sounds more developed and it resonates like an action or thought; weird.<br /><br />3.Fools (5:55): The longest song of the Dave era of Van Halen. Begins with a blues-metal influenced guitar solo by Eddie. The rest is typical VH formula.<br /><br />4.Romeo Delight (4:19): Nice repeat riff goes on through this song with the smashmouth lyric talk of DLR. This is one of his best lyrical works ever.<br /><br />5.Tora! Tora! (57 secs): To all you jerks who are like \\"Tony Iommi never influenced anybody\\" listen to this. This is definite Sabbath imitation right here by Eddie Van Halen. I am surprised at how authentic these riffs sound.<br /><br />6.Loss of Control (2:36): Van Halen gone speed metal! This is one of the speediest songs I ever heard, in fact even Daves words are going by way too fast, they obviously didn't make this song for thought, so you enlightment people might want to avoid this.<br /><br />7.Take Your Whiskey Home(3:09): Imagine \\"Light Up the Sky\\" with an upbeat rhythm section to it instead of dark.<br /><br />8.Could this be Magic(3:08): A laid back acoustic cajun inspired track.  A real departure from the usual hardpop formula or this is just their way of letting us recover from \\"Loss of Control\\"!<br /><br />9.In a Simple Rhyme(4:33): Amazing sound throughout: it is like soothing and hard at the same time.  I love Micheal's clearly audible bass work that sounds like it is following Eddie's guitar riffs.<br /><br />Just in case you haven't seen the best of list:<br /><br />1.Fair Warning<br /><br />2.Women and Children First<br /><br />3.Van Halen<br /><br />4.1984<br /><br />5.Van Halen II<br /><br />6.Balance<br /><br />7.5150<br /><br />8.OU812<br /><br />9.Diver Down<br /><br />10.For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge(no way am I abbreviating that title!)<br /><br />11.Live: Right Here, Right Now<br /><br />12.Van Halen 3beat rhythm section to it instead of dark. <br />8.Could this be Magic(3:08): A laid back acoustic cajun inspired track.

B000HCO840|5.0|Okay, I don't care!  I love X-MEN TLS! Yeah, I know, I know.  There are some issues with development regarding certain characters, but there are also major strides in that area with others.  Wolverine (as usual), Storm, Magneto, & Jean Gray in her Phoenix incarnation were given the best threads of the story, and came out on top.  This movie has AMAZING action sequences, cool special FX, some great prerequisite one-liners, and ultimately resounds as a compelling allegory for numerous relevent social issues (racism, terrorism, homophobia, etc.) <br /> <br />The major flaw with X3 is just the running time.  It should have been 2 hours +.  But it is, what it is, and considering the number of characters (major & minor) poor Mr. Ratner had to contend with, I think he did quite well at telling a succinct and intriguing story, as well as preserving the integrity of the X-Men universe.   I know many disagree, but that's what makes ballgames.... <br /> <br />Extras on the standard version:  deleted footage, 3 alternate endings, & commentary should be enough to whet your appetite. <br /> <br />BUT, in addition to the extras that are on the standard version, the collector's version includes a 100 page \\"commemorative book\\" and a new Stan Lee comic. <br /> <br />Can't wait for X4!

B000G75AE8|4.0|When I put on this record, I kept something in mind.  These guys are old, all the tricks have been done and the boundaries have been pushed.  There's no sense expecting this or any band to capture atmosphere of over 20 years.  What this albums proves, is that even at the age of 40+, these guys are still the most powerful thrash band around.  They continue to deliver brutal music, without a hint of weakness, which is more than I can say for other metal bands. <br /> <br />The only real problem I have is that the lyrics sound a bit forced on the religion subject, but what can you expect for a band that's been writing songs for 25 years. <br /> <br />Solid Album!!

B000002J09|5.0|There is no doubt about the fact that Led Zeppelin were the greatest rock band of all times along with Pink Floyd and the Who.they produced several landmark albums right from their debut till prsence.this was their best due to anthems like Black Dog,Rock and roll and Stairway to heaven.You got to have this at any cost.Not to be missed.
B00020HEL6|5.0|Frankly, the first song I heard was \\"On a Slow Boat to China.\\" As a former lounge lizard piano player, this was always one of my favorite songs, and this arrangement was as close to how I played it, as I have ever heard. I knew absolutely nothing about Renee Olstead other than her name. After visiting her website (which plays the songs of this albums while you browse) I heard another favorite;\\" Taking a Change on Love.\\" Today, I read that she is only a teenager, and am blown away. Not exactly what I was expecting. Far better!!! <br /> <br />Now I read that David Foster was the producer, and obviously the orchestral composer. Say what you want, but a great singer without a great orchestra is just average. Both are contingent on the other to achieve perfection. <br /> <br />The key to a successful musician is making their music sound as effortless, and simplistic as possible, convincing you, the listeners that you can jump right in there and perform as well as they are without missing a beat. You and I both know that is not practical. Renee sounds as if she walked into the studio one day and said,\\" Let's burn out an album.\\"  That is talent. <br /> <br />I don't care for every track on the album, and find the lack of focus disrupting. I hear too much trying to give me the biggest bang for my buck. With some tracks, she sings entirely different than others, trying to mimic the gene of the song rather than stamping the song with her own label which she is strong enough to accomplish without reservation.  <br /> <br />I am sure this will not be her last album. I hope that she reads the constructive criticism's and digests them.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />

0316743003|5.0|Believe me if a Russian aviation nut goes to bed in 4 A.M. when he could not stop reading this, it really worth buying. Filled with good humor and Kelly Johnson's 'Goddam!'s, it also has an insider look at US aerospace industry decision making, sometimes wery paradoxal. I suspected that titanium for SR-71 was bought in Soviet Union and knew from our industry insiders that we captured D-21 Tagnoard a long time ago, but here I've seen proof from the first hands. I was nearly crying reading about Kelly Johnson death - I didn't know details before - and Lockheed's farewell to him publishing all-black newspaper page with crying Skunk Works skunk...Frankly, Johnson's memoirs were not so intriguinig for me, but now I'll re-read them with the other feelings. Highly recommend.

B000G75AE8|5.0|For those who don't know i'm probably the last person that would get into this style of metal. I was more of an 80s arena rock person until maybe a couple years ago when my tastes started getting heavier. Anyways the album that introduced me to \\"true\\" heavy metal was Slayer's God Hates Us All. I was sold immediatley. I then proceeded to the back catalog and immediatley picked out albums that i thought was more my tastes. It seems like since  Divine Intervention they have been tryng to become more accessible. They expiremented with mainstream earlier before with Seasons in the Abyss and South of Heaven so mixed response. Personally, for me, South Of Heaven is one of my all time favs. So with that being said How does \\"Christ Illusion\\" rate? <br /> <br />Well I think they took what was successful in there previous albums and used it completley on this album. Christ Illusion is what Metallicas St. Anger tried to be. Granted they are 2 different beasts however Slayer has always stayed true to what they are about while Metallica has changed with each flavor of the month. Thank God they didn't go to rap-metal! Metallica then tried to go back to there thrash metal roots when all of a sudden they realized they forgot about the fans that put them on the pedistal they were on. Plus with the Napster fiasco they didn't wanna lose any more fans. Slayer never left there roots. <br /> <br />Christ Illusion is one of those rare albums where a band can take a lengthy hiatus and come back possibly heavier then before. Is Christ a revoultionary album? No. The formula has been done before. But what makes this album 5 stars is they present it well and the writing is pretty strong. Thats what makes a 5 star album. the sound AND the writing. Granted I could do without the F bomb as much as it was in there. But if it works hey more power to them. <br /> <br />So all in all if God Hates Us All made you lose a little faith in the band. Christ Illusion will bring you back to the darkside withOpen Arms! lol. Definitley give this album a chance and i'm sure you will feel the same.
0671015206|1.0|I listed to the audio book.  I was surprised when after 2 hours, thinking it was nearly over, I discovered it's 8 hours long.  I was already bored 2 hours into it.  It's very repetitve.  The basic idea is to save your money, don't spend it, and you can be weathly.  But what I think most people miss is that's not the entire point of the book.  The purpose of the book is to describe millionaires.  Who are they?  How do they buy cars?  How do they buy suits?  Houses?  Etc.  These insights could be really interesting for people marketing to millionaires.  But for people who mistakenly bought this book thinking they'd learn how to be rich.. well it's a big disappointment.   <br /> <br />I found many of the statistics interesting.  For example, many people are criticizing the authors because blacks weren't in the ethnic lists.  Well if the author's research doesn't have them in the top 10 then is it the author's fault?  They're presenting the results of their surveys.  If blacks didn't fill out the surveys then they're not in the results.  I think you have to keep in mind, what kind of person would fill out of lengthy survey for $1?  Not many.  Just really tightwads.  So it's not surprising that the millionaires they profile are all tightwads!!! <br /> <br />Overall it's an interesting academic text that would be much better if it were about 1/8 of its size.  As it is, I couldn't finish it.  I made it 2/3 of the way and am so bored with it that I can't continue.  Before you say this review isn't helpful, sort the reviews by \\"lowest rating first\\" and you'll see that I'm not the only one, many people feel this way.
B000B8QEZG|1.0|The one thing I can give Madonna credit for is having excellent marketing and business sense.  Everybody knows porn sells and this was the foundation of her career.  End of story.  Can she sing?  Nope and never could.  The boards in the studio (and in concert sometimes) helps to put all those bad notes and lack of tone into a decent straight line.  That is when she isn't lipsynching.  YES SHE DOES LIPSYNCH!!  The 'music' used to be slamming but once she discovered Bjork that became her new target to be like.  The problem is Bjork really can sing and her eclectic style is not easy to copy or master.  But Madge did try.  Madonna has and always will be the greatest copiest of someone else's style good or bad.  But because its her, people buy into the 'she's being original' when she is not.  Madonna died for me after Vogue and she is still trying to figure out who she is.  This cd was a gift to me and I didn't even open it since I had heard most of the tracks.  I donated it to a music store for resell.
B000E41MS6|5.0|My father was a fan of the original series. I watched many an episode with him. I loved the premise of the show. The new series is so much better in my opinion because it has the heart of the original with the technology and dark humor of today. Makes for a great combo. Billie Piper is great as his side kick/partner. She is more than a match for the Doctor. She (her character) is what was missing in the old series. Great work BBC!!

B00006F83Y|4.0|Pretty much everything to be said about this album has already been written previously, so this will be brief.<br /><br />For me this album has some hits and misses, but the hits are huge and keep on coming while the misses barely register.<br /><br />The only thing I wish the band did was keep that opening riff from 'Gonna Leave You' going the whole time.  How the hell is that thing still imbedded in my mind?
B00005QGAT|5.0|This is the album that put Michael Jackson, the solo artist on the map. Showing a more mature Jackson who finally enjoyed the creative control he deserved and who knew what he wanted, Off The Wall took the world by storm with its flawless combination of groovy disco masterpieces (Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough, Workin' Day And Night, Get On The Floor, Off The Wall), slick R&B tracks (Rock With You, I Can't Help It, It's The Falling In Love) and one heart-breaking ballad (She's Out Of My Life). <br /> <br />The great thing about listening to Off The Wall (and especially this remastered edition) now, 27 years after its release, is that the majority of the album's tracks still sound fresh! Michael, together with Quincy Jones, did something really special in creating a collection of songs that were not only innovative for their time but could also stand the test of time. This album is a true classic and deserves a place in anyone's music collection. <br /> <br />A note on the extra material on this disc: <br />Of the three special edition MJ albums that contain extra material (Thriller and Bad being the other two), this one is imo the most interesting. It contains the original demo’s of Don’t Stop ‘Til You Get Enough and Workin’ Day And Night, both of which were recorded by Michael at home (with the help of his younger siblings Janet and Randy), using glasses, cowbells and God knows what else to create the unique sound of those tracks. The random banther and unique combination of instruments make the demo's not only interesting but also just plain fun to listen to.
078324228X|5.0|This film is a true story. It is important for you to know that because some of the facts and reactions seem excessive, and yet... It all starts with a bunch of rowdy black kids who run across an older white man, a local personality who starts playing with these boys of ten or eleven and these boys decide to fight against it, probably without knowing what they were fighting against, except that it was not correct to let an older white man touch you if you were a little black boy. Local police and justice officials will go along a road that leads the same boy who is arrested for « molesting » the older man to a triple death sentence for a triple murder that he never committed and that will never be investigated properly. The film is absolutely outstanding because it sets the emphasis on this black man, an ex-world champion in boxing, transcending this fate and getting so high in his meditation that he is truly free in prison and truly divine in his mind. This Hurricane thus set as an example and model to anyone whose freedom is endangered, we can move to the 15 year old black boy from Brooklyn who buys and reads Rubin Carter's book in a booksale for 25 cents. His own life is a series of accidental cicumstances that lead him from deprevation among alcoholics to some achievement in a « host family » in Canada. This black boy, Lesra, identifies with Rubin and gets involved in his case. His Canadian guardians get along with this involvement and they will eventually bring the truth out and convince a federal court that the man is innocent and has to be released from prison immediately. What is important here is how these people react and organize their search and how it succeeds thanks to some nearly immaterial circumstances that go their way and not the simple automatic and habitual way. It is such cases that justify people in thinking there is hope in our societies where the poor cannot have any justice at all because they cannot afford good lawyers from the very start, and later on it is too late : the initial damage can rarely be redeemed, and yet some cases are there to prove it could, even if it does not most of the time. This is one of the films that should be studied in details in all high schools all over the world.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine & University of Paris I Pantheon-Sorbonneart, and later on it is too late : the initial damage can rarely be redeemed, and yet some cases are there to prove it could, even if it does not most of the time.

B000068OCS|5.0|Over the past few years, I've taken notice of the complaints about the MGM version of \\"Koyaanisqatsi\\". Specifically the blurriness and out of focus transfer they did when they first released the film. I have since made it my quest to find a 'cleaner' transfer of the film. <br /> <br />I was in Barnes & Noble the other day, when I saw (quite in disbelief) a copy of the MGM release with a sticker on the outside wrapping. This sticker was located on the upper left corner on the front of the DVD that said, \\"New high resolution transfer\\" or words to that effect. The packaging was exactly the same as my blurry version I already had at home. There was virtually no difference whatsoever in the artwork or details of the film listed on the back. I went up to a clerk and made them promise me to let me exchange the DVD if I took it home and discovered that it was the same muddy version that I already had. <br /> <br />When I got home I opened it up. The disc also has the exact same artwork as my muddy disc......and nowhere on the disc or on the cover did it say anything about being changed (only the sticker on the outside wrap). I really had little if no hope at all that this was going to be any different that my other one. I put the disc in and started playing it, and to my pleasure and surprise, the film had indeed been sharpened up quite nicely. <br /> <br />Now, don't get me wrong......the transfer wasn't crystal clear like Powaqatsi and Naqoyqatsi.....but it was definitely a marked improvement. <br /> <br />For those of you who are trying to find this new transfer, just make sure you see that sticker in the upper left corner on the front. I think you'll be pleased at how much clearer the images are now. <br /> <br />And as for all the complaints about the 1:85:1 aspect ratio, I think that you should all read Producer Joe Beirne's (Naqoyqatsi) entry here in the Koyaanisqatsi page. He has made it abundantly clear that the 1:85:1 version IS the DIRECTOR'S APPROVED version ofthe film. You may not like the bars at top and bottom, but that's the way that Director Godfrey Reggio wants you to see it. So, I'll use a great quote made popular in the 1990's.....Get Over It!!! <br /> <br />Now down to some business...........would anyone be interested in buying a copy of the muddy version of Koyaanisqatsi? hee hee :-)
8799701650|3.0|In college Latin there is really only two choices for texts. A Majority of teachers use the old reliable Wheelok's Latin, while a growing minority use Orberg. My school used Orberg. Orberg is helpful for learning the \\"Natural Method\\" and he really does get one to think, however, sometimes it is hard to understand what is going on. the lack of english definitions makes it hard sometimes to learn what he wants you to learn. Also, forget about the Grammatica Latina. unless you are fairly fluent, it is hard to figure out what it says. Hopefully you have a great teacher, because if you have to rely mostly on the book, you won't go far.
0767812387|3.0|Overall this movie was a little slow, the plot was predictable, and it took a little long to get there.  The best part of this movie was the dance sequences.  The opening scene in Cuba looked completely staged and not authentic at all.  The best part of this movie was the dance competition which comes at the end of the movie after you have sat through almost two hours of very drawn out rather boring scenes.
0393316041|5.0|This book is by far the best non-technical science book. Period. You don't have to be a scientist to love the spirit of Richard Feynman. From discovering the behaviors of ants with sugar to his stints as an artist and musician, Feynman reminds us all that the world is still our playground, waiting to be discovered. <br /> <br />
B000002H33|5.0|I was at a college party, and I started going through the cassettes of a friend of mine.  All of them were the usual crappy, metal bands from the 1980's, like Slayer, Ratt, Dokken, etc., etc..  Then I came across this album, and initially I was going to throw it back in the box.  Luckily, I didn't.  I loved the fact that it had 3 songs that clocked in over 8 minutes.  That was really cool.  So when I finally got this album, it more than lived up to my expectations.  Every song on it is excellent, but my favorite has to be Disposable Heroes.  8 1/2 minutes of brilliant, non stop musicianship, and some of Hetfield's greatest lyrics.  Orion, the title track, and Battery are all great songs.  Metallica has always shown a willingness to grow (which has annoyed some fans).  I've always respected them for that.  To call them metal underestimates them.  They're one of the greatest bands in rock history.
B0000E6XH3|5.0|Unless you're a fun-hating space alien with no soul, you probably love being out at night surrounded by neon lights dancing your heart out.  Interstella 5555 captures that sensation perfectly in its opening sequence.  It is one of the trippiest, most feel-good movies ever made.  Romance, adventure, heartbreak, joy, science fiction - it's all in there - in the form of a 68-minute-long Daft Punk music video.  Enjoy it.  You WILL.  And don't buy that crap about having to be somehow inebriated to appreciate - I've only seen Interstella while sober, and I loved it each and every time (trust me, my opinion is worth millions).<br /><br />^_^
B000002G7E|5.0|All of the Velvet's albums were unique in their own way (sans Squeeze, Doug Yule's solo attempt to keep the Velvet's name alive).  This is perhaps the most unique of the bunch.  While I like the 1st and 3rd albums the best, this is still a fantastic album.  Lou's lead guitar playing on I Heard Her Call My Name recalls Yoko's screeches and Ornette Coleman's manic free jazz solos (which I think is a good thing).  The Sister Ray marathon is perplexing.  It's a fantastic song, yet I think I've made it through the entire thing only once or twice.  I usually get to about the 8 minute mark, then I just give up, like Tom Wilson, the enigneer who reportedly left the studio and said \\"tell me when it's over\\".  There are actually LONGER versions of Sister Ray on the Bootleg Tapes, Vol. 1 (upwards of 38 minutes), so this version is actually the easiest of them all to listen to.  In conclusion, it's a sonic wall of garage band noise, but fantastic if you're in the mood for it.  Makes a great double bill with Metal Machine Music....
B00005JMFQ|3.0|Love Actually is a very Brit film that follows almost 10 couples who are in some stage of a relationship and showcases them in a six-week period.  Added in is a storyline about an old-time rocker who makes a surprise comback with a catchy Xmas song.    While I give the uniformly excellent cast highest marks, there are simply too many storylines and too many improbabilities (for example, a PM falling for a secretary and making like Tom Cruise in Risky Business at #10 Downing St) and coincidences to make the film believable -- and I do believe in coincidence, having been part of many that startled me.    (One of my favorite stories, however, depicts a couple who meet as stand-ins performing graphic nude scenes for big stars in the flicks.  When they decide to date, fully clothed, they instantly become shy and embarassed.)    As the relationships vary a lot in one's likely level of interest, Love Actually can drag at times.  Nor do the filmmakers bother to offer any genuine surprises in the plotting.
B000005J56|4.0|Just a classical \\"MUST\\" for starters in chillout-music. There are some very good tunes for a almost twenty-year old CD. I'll ask everyone interested in chillout to buy it, it's really hearsome.
B000FVQM2Y|5.0|To know whether or not you would be interested in watching \\"Brick,\\" all you have to do is answer a rather odd little question.  Are you interested in seeing a Dashiell Hammett hard-boiled detective story played out as a high school film noir?  Now if you are a fan of Hammett and the book and/or movie version of \\"The Maltese Falcon\\" the idea of a teenagers spouting dialogue like they were Sam Spade and Kaspar Gutman trapped in younger bodies might be enough to put you off your lunch already.  Furthermore, if you are well versed in American cinema the idea might bring to mind Alan Parker's \\"Bugsy Malone,\\" which put Jodie Foster and a bunch of other pre-teens in a 1930s Chicago gangster movie.  But that weird little experiment was not half bad and \\"Brick\\" is a lot more successful in trying to pull this off and is a lot closer to \\"Sin City\\" than to \\"Bugsy Malone.\\"  \\"Brick\\" won the Sundance Film Festival's Special Jury Prize for Originality of Vision, and you have to grant writer-director Rian Johnson that much for sure.<br /><br />At the start of the film, Johnson's hero Brendan Frye (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) finds the dead body of Emily (Emilie de Ravin) in a drainage ditch.  She had called him earlier in the day pleading for help and later saw her in the back seat of a car as it drove away.  Now she is dead.  So he decides to find out who killed her and starts backtracking on what she had been doing and with whom.  The only one Brendan can trust is the Brain (Matt O'Leary), who is basically a walking computer who observes a lot by just watching while it seems he is working on his computer or solving a Rubik's Cube.  This leads him to the high school drug ring and the major players, although not without Brendan getting his face smashed in a few times in his effort to shake things up and see what happens next.<br /><br />The other players are the Pin (Lukas Haas), Tugger (Noah Fleiss), Dode (Noah Segan), and Brad Bramish (Brian J. White), with Laura (Nora Zehetner) and Kara (Meagan Good) as the femme fatales.  Beyond that last alliterative appellation I do not want to say who is what because half the fun here is in watching Brendan find out who is what.  The other half is listening to what these characters have to say, because the rhythms are Hammet's, but the glossary is often idiosyncratic and the dynamic is pure high school (My favorite is when Brendan is engaged in a conversation that has descended down to both parties saying \\"Yeah\\" a lot and he finally shoots back, \\"There's a thesaurus in the library. Yeah is under 'Y'. Go ahead, I'll wait\\").<br /><br />While for the most part this movie takes place in a Charlie Brown world where adults are absent, there are a few notable exceptions.  Brendan has been of use to Assistant Vice Principal Trueman (Richard Roundtree) in the past, but that relationship is now tenuous.  However, it does suggest that the \\"bulls\\" are out there somewhere, and Brendan has to get to the bottom of things without or at least before the authorities get involved.  Then there is the Pin's mother (Reedy Gibbs), whom I mention simply because very rarely do you get to see a criminal mastermind's mother putter around the kitchen making sure everybody has something to drink.<br /><br />Everybody in \\"Brick\\" is dead serious about what they are doing and they never blink an eye at all of the verbiage that comes spilling out every time they start flapping their gums.  The illusion of this strange reality is maintained from start to finish, when Brendan confronts the guilty party in the middle of a high school football field.  At that point Johnson most clearly invites comparisons to \\"The Maltese Falcon\\" because at this point he knows that you have either bought the game plan here and will enjoy the more overt homage, or this would be the final nail in the coffin.  For me the results are certainly enough to warrant rounding up on this 2005 film and to hope that Johnson can find something equally creative for his next venture.  That will be hard to do, but you have to feel that based on \\"Brick\\" he might be able to carry it off and not be a one cult classic wonder.<br /><br />Final Note: Is Emilie de Ravin ever allowed to play a character that is not pregnant?  I am just asking, because after \\"Roswell\\" and \\"Lost\\" we are now at the point where that seems to be all she plays and I can just see Hollywood execs saying \\"We need an actress to play a young pregnant woman, go get Emilie de Ravin.\\"  If she ever does become pregnant for real people are going to look at her and ask what movie she is doing it for.or his next venture.  That will be hard to do, but you have to feel that based on \\"Brick\\" he might be able to carry it off and not be a one cult classic wonder. <br /> <br />Final Note: Is Emilie de Ravin ever allowed to play a character that is not pregnant?

B000FS9FCG|5.0|Wow! This is a terrific movie, a parable of future history from a liberal viewpoint. Warning- some people may find the movie offensive to their religious and/or political beliefs. <br /> <br />However, the movie is the telling of how \\"absolute power corrupts absolutely.\\" With an incredibly strong performance by Natalie Portman, Hugo Weaving and Stephen Rea, the movie tells of a fascist society that is shaken when a character known only as V blows up the Old Bailey Courthouse while the 1812 Overture plays loudly on the loudspeakers placed throughout the streets of London. Evey (Natalie Portman) is a naïf that V (Hugo Weaving) rescues from the guards when they are about to arrest her for violating curfew. Stephen Rea is the police inspector charged with tracking V, and as he trudges through his investigation, his faith in the government and his superiors is destroyed. <br /> <br />V and Evey are drawn to each other while Evie is at the same time repelled by him. After he commits a murderous raid on the TV station where Evey works, she saves him from being arrested. He takes her to his hidden bunker and refuses to let her leave. He continues his murderous spree and Evey, in the course of helping him with one of the murders, escapes from him. However, she is soon taken prisoner by the police and tortured while undergoing interrogation about V's whereabouts. <br /> <br />The end of the movie is truly stirring and brings to mind the revolutionary march scene from Les Miserables. The earlier scenes between Evey and V are very reminiscent of The Phantom of the Opera, although Evey never does see underneath V's mask. She doesn't need to because by the end of the movie she, and we, learn exactly who V is in a scene that is surely one of the great scenes of movie history. <br /> <br />This is not a movie for young children due to scenes of graphic, realistic violence. However, people who are resistant to viewing the movie because it is produced by the same people who producedthe Matrix or because they don't like Science Fiction movies or Super Hero movies can put those reservations aside. The movie is in no way a Science Fiction movie or even an action thriller, although there are action scenes in it. To go back to the beginning of this review, the movie is a parable, and one that can be enjoyed even by people who don't like \\"genre\\" movies. <br />

0671027387|3.0|Dan Brown writes a good book.  It is not Shakespeare, but it is a good, engrossing read.  What bothers me however, is the statement on the first page that claims, \\"all technologies in this book exist.\\"  Already being addicted to Wikipedia, I looked them all up and found that no, they do not.  I really wish that he would stop trying to connect his fiction with the real world.  Inevitably someone will come along and actually research his claims and discover that he is wrong.  Sometimes I really wonder if Dan Brown actually thinks that his readers are too lazy or stupid to do a little research on the supposed facts presented in his books.  It angers me greatly.
0156027321|3.0|This book was certainly readable and kept me reading to find out what would happen, but I have trouble understanding why the book became so popular.  Unlike other reviewers I did not much like the narrator.  I found his writing in the early parts of the book, where he talks about zoos and his thoughts on religion, to be didactic in style as if he feels obligated to teach us something.  This trait annoys me in people and could maybe be forgiven in a non-fiction book but I found it irritating in a novel.  In the next section of the book he tells his harsh survival story at sea, complete with unpleasant accounts of eating and being eaten.  Due to my mixed feelings about the narrator, I was more concerned about the well-being of the tiger, Richard Parker (and this coming from a vegetarian - ah well, I always was a cat lover).  As his narrative progresses he drops hints that he is maybe not the most reliable narrator, assuming the reader has already discounted the implausibility of the orangatan floating over to the boat on a raft of bananas - an image I love to picture someone trying to recreate as an experiment in a swimming pool.  At the end, the didactic purpose of the tale (\\"this is a story that will make you believe in God\\") is wrapped up with some dubious theology.  I'm not sure people who believe in God already would find it a convincing argument.  As an agnostic, I would like to disagree with the narrator (and presumably the author), choosing agnosticism is not akin to \\"choosing immobility as a means of transportation\\", it is choosing to be intellectually honest with oneself.
0920668364|5.0|This is a beautifully written book about the bond between mother and child.  I read this book to our newborn son every night before we go to bed.  I plan on writing in the front cover about how much he means to me and will give it to him when he is older.
B000286RNY|4.0|I love this movie. This and Kung Fu Hustle are among my favorite kung fu flicks of all time. The story is absolutely absurd but the movie is so much fun that I could care less. It's funny, touching and inspired, with some instances of cheesy special effects and strange humor laced throughout. If you liked Kung Fu Hustle at all, you have to watch this film. It's that simple.<br /><br />I finally purchased the DVD today and I have to say that I'm slightly disappointed and only because this DVD is lacking in the features department. There isn't much here besides both cuts of the film (the US and the original Chinese, the latter of the two being the one to watch), so you're covered if you can't stand the dubbed version or if you're not into the sometimes strange Chinese humor. But that's really it. No special features to speak of.<br /><br />The picture quality is fine but I have to make special mention of the sound. This has one of the most active 5.1 mixes and if you want a film that really puts your surround system to the test, look no further.<br /><br />In a nutshell, if you want a technically great presentation of the film and not much else, go with this. If you are looking for an edition loaded with behind the scenes info and commentary, etc, etc, prepare to be sorely disappointed.
B000FVQM2Y|5.0|I have a blockbuster movie pass and I watch up to 80-100 movies a year. After seeing Joseph Gorden-Levitt's performance in Manic, and mysterios skin. I was chomping at the bit to rent this movie. This movie does not dissapoint. I know some people will not agree with me, but I see one of the best character actors in the making. I would even compare his perfomances to the the earlier edward norton movies (ie primal fear,american history X, and fight club) I loved the way there were non traditonal fight scenes that are so much in abundance today. This movie is a little long, but I absolutley loved this movie. <br />
B00005JL78|5.0|Minority Report is a sophisticated and intelligent take on the time worn theme of the predator becoming the prey.   <br /> <br />Set in a gritty, detached, futuristic America, Tom Cruise plays an intolerant and jaded law enforcment agent whose sense of justice and fairness is clouded by the disapearance of his seven year old son years earlier.  He is a firm believer in new police technology that harnesses the power of three psychics - pre congnitives as they are called - to predict criminal behavior and enable law enforcment officers to arrest potential criminals before they actually commit crimes.   The ACLU has been asleep at the wheel that's for sure.   <br /> <br />When Cruise's character is set up to be a victim of his own beloved crime technology he sets out to find out who is behind his frame up and why.  <br /> <br />Tom Cruise has seriously damaged his credibility but he is truly the mose underrated actor of our day.  It's a shame that his star status has overshadowed his acting ability.  His performance in Minority Report is brilliant and Steven Speilburg creates a gritty noir world that invokes a stylish cross between  Escape from New York and Blade Runner.  This is the sort of movie that gets under you skin and will stay in your thoughts for days afterward.  It's haunting, disturbing, troubling and intense.  <br /> <br />
078681859X|2.0|The author begins his story slowly, continues it through out the entire book until the last 2-3 chapters where the pace picks up for a dramatic scene and a complete let down ending. I was excited to begin this book but as of this point in time, I have no desire to finish this trilogy because the meat of the book was slow, boring and non eventfull.
B0000046ZJ|5.0|This is hands-down, the best jazz album I've ever owned. Whether sitting in front of the speakers with eyes closed, absorbing every note, or using it as unobtrusive (but swingin') background music while I work, this album shines. <br /> <br />If you're an audio snob who expects every last KHz of treble to be there, you will be dissappoined. The audio quality is only on par with a good cassette tape, but the music more than makes up for it.
1400032717|4.0|Hard to say.  This book is an odd read.  It is certainly light reading, and faxcinating in it's perspective.  The most interesting part of the read is living the part of the autistic youngster and seeing and feeling the world through his senses.  <br />This book is one you need to be in the right mood for.  The first time I picked it up, I read 40 pages and was tempted to junk it.  A month later, I picked it up and found it engrossing.

B000ETQRCM|4.0|Pearl Jam when back to its roots and produced a good album.  This album is 10X better than No Code but not quite Vitalogy.  So, what does this mean for listeners?  It means the work will grow on you, it is angst, and it is good to work out with.<br /><br />I don't think this is a grammy award winner waiting to happen but it is worth the money at WalMart or Target or wherever you choose to pick it up.

B00005JKQZ|5.0|Before watching any Russell Crowe movie, I thought of him as a pretentious jerk.  After watching this movie, (my first RC movie), I fell in love.  So much so that I had to rent  Cinderella Man and Gladiator.  An exceptional actor who took the story of John Nash and made us understand the reality of Schizophrenia.  You would be crazy not to watch this.

The choices they make are based on their economic and values systems, but their choices are also limited by their geography, climate and resources.<br /><br />The details given about some of those societies portrayed in the book may be debatable, but there's a common theme that cannot be dismissed...<br /><br />...Since we cannot manipulate our climate and we are limited by our geography and resources on this planet, this book is a reminder for us to examine our economic and values systems.
B000000OQ5|5.0|Tesla is amazing, and it brings me back to my high school days!  Fun stuff, and highly recommended for anyone who loves listening to good guitar and a unique voice.
068484267X|5.0|It is so fascinating to read the book which combines humor, sadness, cruelty, and everything else. What touched me the most was the fact how Frank McCourt writes the events from the child's point of view... such simple things that catch the attention of a child and how different and full of mysteries life seems when you are young. Honesty to the fullest in this memoir! (sometimes maybe a bit too much) I also enjoyed the presentation of irish life! and how ironic it seems that no matter how poor you are you just don't want to admit it! (the moment when Frank's father refuses to go gather coal, and of course many others) <br /> <br />enjoy
B000002C1W|5.0|I still love this album.  One of my Pink Floyd favorites!
B000ETQRCM|5.0|Pearl Jam is one of the best bands out there today (if not the very best) and this album shows that they are still going strong.  Although I think there are two weak tracks on this album, Comatose and Big Wave, the rest of the album sure makes up for them.  Severed Hand and Inside Job are my personal favourites.  I find the first half of the album very catchy and any of the songs could have been picked for singles.  I was very disappointed to see them make videos for World Wide Suicide and Life Wasted though.<br /><br />Here's my ratings of each song and some comments:<br /><br />1. Life Wasted-10/10 one of my favourites upon first listen of the album, very catchy!<br /><br />2. World Wide Suicide-10/10 had it not been overplayed, fun song to sing along to live!<br /><br />3. Comatose-7/10 an alright song, but I expect better from PJ<br /><br />4. Severed Hand-100/10 when I first heard this song on Letterman I was just amazed and couldn't wait to get my hands on this album because this is definitely a killer track<br /><br />5. Marker in the Sand-10/10 a good solid song that I can't help singing along to<br /><br />6. Parachutes-10/10 doesn't really sound like PJ, but still a great song<br /><br />7. Unemployable-10/10 it took a while for this song to grow on me, but oh man, I freakin' love this song now!<br /><br />8. Big Wave-6/10 a pretty weak track for PJ<br /><br />9. Gone-10/10 love this song, Eddie follow the Canadian dream!!<br /><br />10. Wasted Reprise-5/10 but what can you expect from a reprise?<br /><br />11. Army Reserve-10/10 another great track, did take me a bit to warm up to though<br /><br />12. Come Back-15/10 love this song, so emotional<br /><br />13. Inside Job-100/10 why were they keeping McCready from writing songs before?  Holy crap this is an amazing song!
B00002E224|5.0|Before Sunrise is a unique film, because it seems to appeal to action-oriented guys too.  I guess that it appeals to the side of them that wants to get the girl of their dreams, and the movie acts like a primer that is fail safe.  I can't think of a \\"gentleman\\" who would not want to have a night like that at least once in his life.  Younger men, especially, need preparation in taking on romance, as romance is not particularly comfortable territory for males.  However, if a man can find a woman he loves, this love will rival the Super Bowl, World Cup, moto cross, or any intriguing gadget.<br /><br />Appeal to the psyche of men is a major key in the success of this film.  Of course, many feminine minds relate instantly to Julie Delpy's character, that is predictable and standard, but only a man's man type will be able to relate to Jesse, Ethan Hawke's character  (the type being a guy who fits into the masculine spectrum somewhere).  To me, a man's man is Clark Gable, John Wayne, Humphrey Bogart, any James Bond and, lately, Tyler Perry.  I imagine these screen idols being like Ethan Hawke's character.  Regular guys, like me, want to be like these guys.  We want to live life to the fullest.  And sometimes, really, the best things in life are free.  I never will be too old to learn something new about living well.<br /><br />If you try to over analyze or receive some great psychological awakening from this film, you will be bored and disappointed.  Moreover, this film is strictly from an American male's perspective.  And we know how American men are perceived abroad.  But if you want to receive insight in how to spontaneously connect with your soul mate, you will be rewarded with basic tools that may allow you to exist until that moment presents itself, to recognize the moment, and to \\"seize the day.\\"  This is a metaphorical \\"primer.\\"  One more thing: this movie has the Generation-X plague.  If that disturbs you, then keep away.<br /><br />If you liked this, then you will love Before Sunset, which is the perfect conclusion to the romantic man's primer.ou will love Before Sunset, which is the perfect conclusion to the romantic man's primer. <br />
B000EHSVQE|2.0|I'm serious. I feel left out. Just about everyone I know loves this movie, can quote lines from memory, wears a \\"Vote for Pedro\\" t-shirt, etc. I saw Napoleon Dynamite with five friends on DVD -- they laughed themselves sick, I sat there dumbfounded wondering what all the hype was about. I didn't hate it. I wasn't offended by it. The dance routine at the end was pretty funny. I just don't understand why it became such a big cult hit. Really, I want to join the party. If anyone can enlighten me on just what I'm missing when I watch Napoleon Dynamite, I'm more than willing to listen. Please feel free to contact me.
B000F0UV0E|5.0|The harmony of Knopfler and Harris is tight and beautiful to hear.  Just sit back and listen to all the music - read or sing along with the lyrics and absorb the sounds and feelings.  Emmy Lou's voice is a wonder to those of us who \\"practice the art of harmony\\".  The Amazon reviewer said she felt the CD flat - but I found it to be uplifting throughout.
1400079179|5.0|I read this book 3 years ago.  I have not seen the movie and don't really care to. In 3 years, the details of the book have started to slip away from me, but what remains with me now may be more interesting anyway.  What remains with me is:<br /><br />-The bold suggestion that Da Vinci was compelled to leave codes in his work to message to the world the Great Con of Man.  I give kudos to Dan Brown for being so forward and so risk taking.<br /><br />-The author did a great job of describing these settings (because I still remember them):<br /><br />The Louvre<br /><br />The church in Paris with the Meridian line running through it<br /><br />The church in Scotland where the chalice was suppose to be<br /><br />The Swiss bank<br /><br />The symbol of a chalice and how that represented Mary, the wife of Jesus<br /><br />The memory that the book was intoxicating to read, a page turner on steroids.  It stirred the emotions of those in my bookclub, especially those who grew up Catholic.  It was life changing for them and made me proud to have introduced this book to the club.<br /><br />The memory that this book led me to read the very thick and very dry Holy Blood, Holy Grail, but I'm happy that I did, because I found it fascinating and satisfying to read.<br /><br />I don't really remember the characters very well, which makes me think they were not as developed as well as they needed to be.<br /><br />Jennifer Bouani<br /><br />Author of Tyler and His Solve-a-Matic Machine<br /><br />Teaching Kids how to be Entrepreneurs and Business Leaders
B000056NX5|2.0|The problems with the DVD production are the lead actors. Jerome Pradon is totally unsuited to the role. He might be a good actor, but when he squeaks and whines through rock numbers, it physically hurts my ears. He's best watched when he's silent. Glenn Carter made an brilliant Simon Zealotes on the 1996 recording, and I was very interested in seeing what else he had done, but he disappointed here. Not only his acting range limited, he was only moderately better than Pradon. Renee Castle sounded beautiful, but was brought down by the decision to cry at the end of 'I Don't Know How To Love Him', appearing very tacky.   <br /> <br />Rik Mayall gave a Herod that was sleazy, attempting to be funny and dangerous, but falling flat. Tony Vincent was terrific, in  almost-mad devotion to the \\"cause\\". I keep hoping that the presence of the ever-amazing Mykal Rand as a random apostle is worth the money I paid for the DVD. <br /> <br />The 're-imagining' of the show turns it into the bubble-gum pop, totally unsuitable to the plot. It seems very fake, attempting to be happy-go-lucky, while the story is anything but. The Romans, however, had a very interesting and intriguing look. The set was initially interesting, but after a few scenes, it got to be very repetitive. They didn't have to invest in more than one set, but using different lighting or angles would have broken up the monotony.
B000002UA5|4.0|This double album, Floyd's strangest, was released back in the good ol' hippy days - 1969.  The first album is from a live concert.  Syd had recently left the band and David Gilmour had replaced him as guitarist and vocalist.  Of course, if you're a Floyd fan, this album is essential, and this live recording really gives you a feel for what they sounded like in concert at this time.  Of course, they sound great, especially Wright and Gilmour.  Some of Richard Wright's best soloing to be found on any Pink Floyd album can be found on this disc, and in fact Richard Wright gives the strongest performance of the band and sounds amazing all over the place in this performance.   David Gilmour sounds great too, and he plays as if he is just starting to really figure out what Pink Floyd is all about.   Quite a bit of old-school creative jamming is taking place here, and it's great to hear Floyd live in this era.  My personal favorite on this disc is \\"Careful with that Axe Eugene\\" - what a great version of this dynamic but creepy Pink Floyd jam!  Roger screams as if absolutely possessed! \\"Saucerful of Secrets\\" is a very experimental piece that would make a perfect horror/science fiction soundtrack - especially Richard Wright's intriguing, spooky organ playing accompanied by the otherworldly, ghostly sounds of Gilmour's guitar.      The second disc, a studio disc, is very experimental, if not a bit crazy.  Pink Floyd had recently kicked Syd Barrett out of the band because Syd had gone insane.  This studio disc might make you wonder whether the rest of the band had gone insane as well.  Rick Wright's keyboard solo \\"Sysyphus\\" starts out with a heavy organ theme that sounds positively Satanic.  It soon fades into a classically inspired piano composition which has a few really beautiful moments.  Then, all too soon, it turns into noise.  No musical sensibility here is evident.  No rhythm, no melody, no harmony...  Rick sounds as if he is tripping his brains out, simply banging away on his piano keys, and opening the piano up and plucking on the piano strings randomly...  it is utter madness.  Eventually the evil organ theme returns and that part of the album is over.  Rick seems to be insane at this point in the band's career and sounds as if he's ready to join Syd on the dark side of the moon, but one can detect a glimpse of Wright's raw artistic sensibility if one understands the myth of Sysyphus and is able to visualize this piece as a bizarre musical expression of that myth.      Roger's contributions to the album are more meticulous than Rick's, but you have to wonder about Roger's state of mind when listening to \\"Several Species of Small Furry Animals Gathered Together in a Cave and Grooving with a Pict.\\"  It certainly sounds insane, but at least it is the kind of insanity that will make you laugh.  You may even wonder what kind of old-school studio trickery Roger invented to hew this strange little Pink gem.  It is actually a cleverly assembled bit of art, and is a unique recording - there is nothing else like it that I have ever heard.  Roger's Scottish-Gaelic rant at the end is - well, totally crazy, if not brilliant.  Sounds rather like the lunatic in the hall.  Roger's other contribution, a lovely piece called \\"Grantchester Meadows,\\" is a very tranquil bit of lyrical poetry set to simple music on classical guitar.  You can hear birds splashing about in water and other sounds of nature in the background.  Not a bad song at all, sounds rather like a lunatic on the grass.      The best number, Gilmour's \\"The Narrow Way,\\" is excellent, even though it is half-baked.  This wonderful bit of early Pink Floyd magic has a kind of epic feel to it.  Excellent, super-cool acoustic guitar opening, followed by a very evil-sounding electric guitar riff, followed by some spaced out chords, followed by a dark lyrical melody which David sings beautifully in a way that is far out and sometimes very paranoid, and at other times very hopeful, before another evil, heavy riff emerges from the song's gothic chord progression.  This slow, mysterious, and powerful riff hypnotically repeats itself, effectively building tension, then David starts to solo on the guitar as the whole thing fades out into stoned oblivion.    Nick Mason's \\"Grand Vizier's Garden Party\\" is very strange stuff, the most artsy-fartsy part of the album.  It starts with a rather strange flute melody... then Nick experiments with drum sounds for awhile... the drumming isn't particularly good -no really interesting rhythmic patterns are taking place... it's more like sound effects with drums and reverb...  that goes on for a long time...  then the flute returns to play a rather odd, if not endearing, bit of counterpoint harmony with a couple of other flutes... by that time, if you're still listening to the album, then congratulations!  You made it to the end of Pink Floyd's most unusual and least commercially viable album! Not just anyone can do that!    They say there is a thin line between genius and madness.  Ummagamma is four mad scientists named Pink Floyd illustrating that concept.
0525948023|1.0|i have read  nearly all of Tolles books. All have been incredibly disappointing. This one probably the most disappointing.I understand the reviewers below, some who have not finished the book but have been hooked on the future promise of better things. ( Like a horoscope). Had there been no other books on the market of exactly the same nature before tolle started writing then I would have probably enjoyed some aspects. But really there is nothing new here. Certainly no New earth. That is another fantasy, living in the future idea. The reincarnation idea is also not new and Hindus have practised this for centuries. Obviously new readers will be impressed but those who have searched a little themselves will see the lack of substance in this book before the end. I could not even pass it on to someone else. I thought that would not be a nice thing as i found it so poor in the end.
B00006JJ1O|4.0|Seriously speaking hen i ordered this CD i didnt expect it to do some wonders. But it eventually turned out to be a gr8 one.
B0002W18MU|4.0|if you know that he was dying this is a great tribute to his life.
B000E41MS6|4.0|Like a lot of Americans, The Doctor always meant Tom Baker to me, but Christopher Eccleston, had he had a longer time in the role, could easily have displaced Baker for me. Not only was Eccleston's ninth doctor a wonderful mix of whimsy and tragedy, he also benefited from what has to be the best-written Doctor Who series to date.<br /><br />While \\"Doctor Who\\" has always had its moments of screenplay greatness, never has a single season had so many grace notes, including the tear-jerker \\"Father's Day,\\" the horror and pathos of \\"The Empty Child\\" and \\"World War III\\" and the epic science fiction of \\"Bad Wolf.\\"<br /><br />The only clunker -- and it's enough of a clunker to cost it a star with me -- is the terrible decision to include far-future versions of contemporary British game shows and their version of Extreme Makeover in the penultimate episode. Forget this not holding up well in 10 years, this already feels dated and stupid.<br /><br />But the special effects really are (almost) comparable to contemporary American science fiction shows like \\"Battlestar Galactica\\" (which has the same problem with alien/futuristic people wandering around in contemporary clothes that \\"Dr. Who\\" does). Coupled with solid acting (even from pop star Billie Piper) and top-drawer writing, this season of \\"Dr. Who\\" is a winner for fans old and new.<br /><br />Strongly recommended for fans of science fiction television shows.
B00005JOYM|5.0|It would have been easy for Oliver Stone to focus his attention on the people watching as the planes struck them in the tower.  It would have been more dramatic to concentrate on those who lost their lives as opposed to those who survived.  It would have been more action-packed, if Mr. Stone had followed the news reels, instead of narrowing his vision to just a small team of heroes trapped inside the rubble.  A less experienced director would have made all of those mistakes.  Stone chose to cast light on what really became of America during the moments of September 11, 2001.  None of us need to be reminded of the thousands of lives that perished.  What \\"World Trade Center\\" does remind us of, is how people from across the nation and around the globe came together; how hundreds risked their lives to save only a few, and why peace is not something Americans can take for granted.  Although many a tear was shed at the premiere featuring local police and fire officials, the movie had an uplifting message.  Everyone in the audience that I spoke with loved the movie and many were surprised that the film wasn't more depressing.  I was encouraged by the way the film was crafted and quite pleased with the end result.  New information had come to light that I had not been aware of and it was interesting to see how those directly involved were effected.  I understand that for many, the thought of seeing a recreation of those horrific events will prevent them from venturing out to their local theatre.  I, for one, believe that the film was tastefully done and there's good lessons to be learned by all.  There was only one actual shot in the film that I questioned.  It was news footage of one of the people jumping to their death from one of the top floors.  However, that scene later explains the sound that the firefighters heard as bodies crashed around them.  There was so much confusion from within the buildings that brief glimpses of news footage needed to be shown so that the viewers could better understand what those inside did not.  I had expected to break down during the film, but intermixed with the drama of the situation is some slight humor between the two trapped Port Authority officers as they struggled to maintain composure and keep themselves alive.  I applaud all involved with the project on a job well done.  I never felt that the film took advantage of the terrible situation, but instead, paid incredible respect to the men, women, family, and friends who lives were cut short and forever impacted.  \\"World Trade Center\\" is a fitting tribute to America and for what our nation stands.
B000G75AE8|5.0|Slayer returns after 6 years since GHUA came out and delivers the most true to form cd since South of Heaven. This sounds like the Slayer that got millions hooked with Reign in Blood. The vocals are crisp and clean the production overall is superb. This is the Slayer a few fans have missed since Diablous in Musica. This cd didnt sound forced like God Hates Us All did especially at first. Skeleton Christ and Cult is probaly the most brutal songs on here about religion. The lyrics in these two songs alone earn this cd a parental advisory. But folks this is Slayer. If you want love songs or something to go get pregnant by go to the hip hop or pop genre not metal. A great cd by a great band that has set the standard for everybody. Good job SLAYER!!!
B000F8O35U|5.0|This animated film is one of Disney's very best and was the rebirth of great animated films from Disney. We must thank Alan Menken and Howard Ashman for their wonderful songs and the brilliant animators and writers for structuring and designing this film so well. The classic songs include \\"Kiss the Girl\\" and the Oscar-winning \\"Under the Sea.\\" I highly recomend this great picture!
B00006IM9Q|5.0|The works of Blondie are paragons of the new-wave punk genre on their own without any help of compilation or amassing, but the main priority to mention is how one can adequately mix these supreme works of sound and emotion into such a phenomenal and superior mix, as an impressive result; \\"Blondie's Greatest Hits\\". From the disco upbeat of \\"Heart Of Glass\\" to the romanticly provocative single \\"Denis\\", from the tropical flare of \\"The Tide Is High\\" to the industrial beats and vocals of \\"The Hardest Part\\", this album mix, in the entirety of my life of being a Blondie aficionado and music collector, is one that surpasses any limit of Blondie's quality and proficiency, portraying to the world of their appeal, greatness and utter legacy.
0140185232|5.0|I must admit this was my first Maugham novel, and that his style is not my forte. That being said, I could not set this book down. I dug an old copy out of a chest of books that belonged to my grandmother and was immediately enraptured with the narrator as well as the other characters. Unfortunately my memories have begun to fade as to all the beautifully crafted exploits. Fortunately, that just means I can anticipate reading this phenonemenal coming of age tale again, and again, and again.
B000G75AE8|1.0|this is just an average album, nothing special. if you want good slayer buy Reign In Blood. not this
0953104907|5.0|First of all, I'm not Jeannine; I'm her husband-she bought the book for me. <br /> I have been wanting to build a guitar (and bass) for a very long time, and have been gathering information from a variety of sources. But this book covers it all as far as construction goes, and its not too bad on the finishing side of things. It covers 3 different types of neck construction, and flat top and carved top bodys. Definately money well spent.
B000002KIE|4.0|Its a shame that the sex pistols dressed up and acted like drunken fools. Anarchy in the UK, God Save the Queen, Pretty Vacant and Holidays in the Sun are great rock songs. They did not need the hype. The songs have stood the test of time.<br /><br />What a bunch of losers. If they would have stayed together and developed like any other band, they definitely had potential. Although PIL basically sucked, the second album was very innovative with a couple of cool songs. Lydon was one of the first to experiment with dub and Keith Levene and Jah Wobble were really cool, innovative musicians  Too bad Lydon has alway had his head up his rear end. I hope his public persona is an act b/c, if not, what a jerk!
B00005JOYM|5.0|World Trade Center, a film about the rescue of two police officers who were trapped under the rubble of the Twin Towers on America's Second Day of Infamy, is a film of courage and triumph. It is, in a way, a shout of defience against the terrorists. You have taken many lives on that day, but not these lives. And you have brought out the best in us.<br /><br />And the great miricle of the film is that it was made by Oliver Stone, known better as the perveyor of the dark, paranoid side of the American experience. It is as if someone had taken over the body and mind of the creator of Platoon and JFK and made a film that celebrated patriotism and traditional values, things one would think Stone was innocent of.<br /><br />This film deserves to be seen by every human being. And if that happens, perhaps Hollywood will realize that it doesn't have to insult their audience to make a good film.
B000GTLQXU|2.0|What happened to the Christmas three ?  <br />The main dilemma on the original movie's premise was that Gene Hackman wasn't even sure taking the survivors to the top of the ship was the right move, he couldn't even convince most of them to follow him while the remaining ones questioned every move he made. On this new version the ship turns over and the survivors just take off, no big dilemma, no bad guy to question anybody, just mindless action. Once they get off the ship a conveniently located raft and two arriving helicopters kill off any of the few, remaining sense of suspense. <br />It's been 2 months since I saw this movie in a theater and I have a hard time remmembering who it was that survived and who didn't, in other words, I didn't give a damn and judging by the film's box office results, not many did. <br />I find it incredible that in 2006's Hollywood, $150,000,000 can't buy you a decent remake to a film that in it's day was criticized for its cartoony characters.Compared to the 2006 version all of them (including the insufferable \\"where are you sis!\\" kid) deserved an Oscar.

B000G75AE8|4.0|I've been a Slayer fan for about 8 or 9 years now.  We didnt come to expect this album to be a Seasons in the Abyss or a Reign in Blood.  I was suprised at how well they did on this album.  I'd have to put it up to par with their Diabolus in Musica release,  much better than God Hates us All.   There are some great guitar riffs in this album,  yet there are a few songs where it's just too fast paced,  no intro, etc.. <br />My favorites on this album would have to be Skeleton Christ, Jihad, Catatonic and Cult.  <br /> <br />For how old they are getting i'm really impressed. <br />I hope it's not their last.

0393327655|5.0|This book resonated with me deeply, as I place organized religion at the forefront with most of what is insane with this world.Thousands of years of unrelenting bloodletting is the legacy of faith and the Crusades are happening all over again. <br />If we do not get a handle on the religious/political wars we are all doomed. This is a must read for any intelligent seeker of truth.
B000G75AE8|4.0|I have been waiting since 9/11/01, for this release. Don't get me wrong, GHUA was a very good album, But it is great to get to original band back.  <br />I saw Slayer in concert 7/7/06, and they totally f'king rocked. Seeing the original members back together, and hearing their sound, it was a sight to behold. They played 'Cult' and it sounded great!  <br />'Christ Illusion' feels like it would be in the 'Seasons' time period. That is not a bad thing at all. I was hope hoping for something good, not expecting 'RIB'. They are pissed off and are giving opinions, thoughts about 'BS' religion and government. Tom sounds great as always(on bass and vocally), Kerry and Jeff on guitar are crisp and pack a big punch. But I guess The big stand out is Dave Lombardo. I'm not saying he is the best drummer, he just makes this band 'whole!' In some songs you can 'feel' the drums(they just sound like Dave!), everything just sounds great. I can't wait to see them again in concert.  <br />I gave the album a 4 out of 5, NO THAT IS NOT A BAD RATING!!!! 'Christ Illusion' is a great album, REIGN IN BLOOD IS A 5!!!(masterpiece) '5's only come every so often.

0385720920|3.0|I was a bit let down with this one after reading 3 of his other books.  I kept waiting for some big climactic weird moment and when it came it was just ho-hum for me.  It was a good read, but I was hoping it was going to wow me like his other books I've read.
B00005JMXX|4.0|The movie is outstanding and the delivery was very timely: <br />And buying thru Amazon was extremely easy and nice.
B000EQH2QK|4.0|Since her last release Fijacion Oral Vol. 1, Shakira seems to have reworked the multitude of errors that surrounded that record before putting out Oral Fixation Vol. 2, her first English language album in nearly six years.  For the most part the bleating Colombian singer-songwriter delivers a consistent and highly enjoyable listen, be it the haunting questioning of faith opener \\"How Do You Do\\" or the newly added global No. 1 \\"Hips Don't Lie\\" and reworked \\"La Tortura.\\"  It's not perfect, though, and has a slight misstep with the bland \\"Hey You\\" and the unmemorable \\"The Day and the Time,\\" but fortunately delves into the mix again with superb tracks like the beautiful \\"Dreams For Plans,\\" rock-heavy \\"Animal City\\" and the pro-freedom and disco-infused \\"Timor.\\"  Oral Fixation Vol. 2 is much more likable than its Spanish language predecessor Fijacion Oral Vol. 1.
B000CBO04E|1.0|This CD has the exact same indexing error between the 5th and 6th track as the cheap Columbia domestic disk. The running times are identicle too. What does this mean? No master tapes were used for this \\"remaster\\" only the already flawed Columbia addition. This great music deserves a first class remastering effort and this isn't it. Avoid.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|This cd is incredible.  It rocks from start to finish.  You will not be disappointed, trust me.  And if you think the music is amazing, wait 'til you see them play it live on the Budokan DVD (which I also HIGHLY recommend).
B000F6IOC0|5.0|The original was great,and this one is even better.Great special effects,photography,sets,costumes,and terrific Marco Beltrami music.Excellent action sequences,plus a solid script and direction that really keep things moving well while creating a nice creepy mood and atmosphere and working up a good amount of suspense.And what a cast!All are great,Scott Speedman is much better this time,and Kate Beckinsale is  <br />dynamite!
B000EMGAOY|5.0|Hey now. What's up.  Now I've been a Chili Peppers fan since this March only. A friend kept on telling me that The Chili Peppers are way better than Green Day (Since my music was with them). So I kept on responding to him that RHCP sucks. So I just bought the album By The Way, just sample them, and oh my goodness, the music they produce was truly one of a kind. After ditching Green Day as my favourite number one artist, I started to listen to Californication. That was truly amazing as well. Then I listened to Blood Sugar Sex Magik, and they were a bit different contrasting to By The Way and Californication. It took me a while before I noticed that it was their best work ever. The bass that Flea plays in that album was top notch. Everyone was amazing in that album.    BUT...    I heard about the album Stadium Arcadium. I said to myself, \\"What a horrible album name...\\". I heard Dani California, and it was alright, until it grew on me.  May 9th. The day Stadium Arcadium came out.  I listened to it, and it was horrible. Horrible, horrible, horrible. Oh my god, I can't believe how bad they were. My friend (as mentioned above) told me that it was great. He told me to listen to the second disc if I didn't like the first. To my surprise, I did not like both discs at all. It took me a very very long time to actually listen to it. I listened to the song \\"Snow (Hey Oh)\\" after numerous playings of Dani California. Ant it was starting to grow on me as well. Then I started to listen to songs such as Readymade, and Charlie. Then it expanded from there. It totally blew up on my head. The album is awesome. To this date, I start off listening to Desecration Smile first. That is the most played song in the album for me. I thought that the songs Warlocks, C'mon Girl, Storm In a Teacup was bad. Until I listened to So Much I. I loved it so much, that I practically love every song in the album. This is a great album for all those new RHCP fans. Try picking up Blood Sugar Sex Magik as well, but the transition can be bumpy.    Stadium Arcadium is very soulful, straight from their heart. You can tell in the song Hard To Concentrate. Kiedis talk about one day getting married with someone have having children. The first disc is mostly filled with Californication style groove's, while the second is filled with Blood Sugar Sex Magik, and By The Way.    Bottom Line: I know that many many people have said that this album is bad, because they have listened to the first six songs. Well, that happened to me too. But just try to listen to it, as my friend said. It might be hard, but in the end, it is the best album the Chili Peppers have had to date.
B000FBGBPC|4.0|Overall its a good album.  I can Listen to it from start to finish without many complaints.  I do have to say that it does become repetative in places. <br />
B0000TB01Y|4.0|Not knowing anything about the story line.  Waiting to see the musical.  Good music and vocals.

B000BTC5LW|5.0|The Earl's Court performance comes after a long bout of touring for the Floyd. But what you get is a polished and well heeled performance of your favourite new Pink Floyd and a re-visitation of The Dark Side of The Moon. I think with the technical innovations that 1994 offered, the filming of this particular concert and album will give the most avid \\"Floydian\\" the sense and wonder that although not being there physically, they can be spiritually present. This footage is some of the best \\"Live\\" concert coverage I have seen, and the 5.1 mixing is superb! BY THIS DVD!!!
B0000X61UU|5.0|I swear by this workout! I'm a 21 year old college student who grew up being the unathletic, out of shape, pudgy girl. I pulled this video out of storage my sophomore year of college and did it religiously for 2 months ( sometimes 2 times a week, other times 3 times a week )! Not only did I shed 2% body fat (as tested by my exercise physiology teacher with the underwater weighing method), but I never looked better! Or FELT better! And people noticed! HECK YEAH! I'm teaching an aerobics class this coming semester and I plan on using this workout. THANK YOU CINDY!!! (and Radu- you're the coolest)! <br />Nicole
B000EPFPVU|5.0|I fully agree with the reviewer who said that the import (Japan) version of this title sounded better (thanks for the \\"heads up\\"). I can only think that the other reviewer who stated that it couldn't be better because it was the same thing either 1. has a crappy sound system, 2. has a tin ear, or 3. has never listened to a GOOD import cd. The Japanese DO make the BEST sounding cds....PERIOD! I'm listening to 10,000 days as I write this and it is FANTASTIC! Yes, I have the domestic release of 10,000 days and it is going on Ebay.The Japanese are obsessed with music and demand top quality, a trait that American music companies and the American public do NOT share. Ever heard the initial American pressings of Born To Run or Aqualung? If you have you will know EXACTLY what I'm talking about.I have just ordered the limited edition Japanese releases of Anemia, Undertow and Lateralus. IF you want to hear Tool at their VERY best... BUY THESE while you still can! I also just got tickets for their Wilkes-Barre show... Hope to see you there! BEWARE!!! The so-called Japanese versions of Anemia and Lateralus which I got were actually domestic releases which had been overwrapped with an Obi-stip!!! UNBELIEVEABLE.... Not sure who's responsible for that very expensive trick.

B000EJ9MTW|2.0|The blatant stealing of riff's and musical ideas doen't equate to a band's usage of \\"influences\\". <br /> <br />Wolfmother, in the marketing vein of Everything Old Is New Again, have crafted an album so full of five-fingered lifted riffs that it's hard not to draw the obvious conclusion that this band has no ideas of its own. <br /> <br />Another band, called Kingdom Come tried being Zep. clones. Where are they now? <br /> <br />
B00004U2GH|5.0|What Peter Frampton did with with \\"Frampton Comes Alive\\", Johnny Cash accomplished a few years earlier with \\"Live At San Quentin\\". It takes place in a hell-hole prison, so to say you have an attentive audience is an understatement. Everytime John scratched, talked, sang or twanged a guitar, this audience went up in flames. This crowd is all but up on the stage during this recording and you can hear them loud and clear. The late 60's and early 70's was Johnnys period of total convidence. Not just with his music but with his political views. The \\"Man in Black\\" thing was getting explained in clear detail. Not a popular thing to do for what was then still considered \\"ol boy country\\". You listen to \\"Live\\" and you are certain a riot is damn near ready to break out. Its that vivid. Excellent job in the mastering and mixing on the re-issues. THe audience is right there with John and crew. Not just some background noise and clapping after a tune is finished.  Johnny Cash was the toughest man in the game. All guts, no ego and pure talent. Compare it to the panty waist fluff and digital garbage that country music has mostly become in the 21st century you'll see what I mean.  Sure some is OK, but how many [..] and tight jeans does it take to make a country tune today?? Cash didnt need it for HIS music.
0312323859|2.0|i first learned of emily giffen from reading the summer's \\"must read\\" lists in various magazines. they all recomended \\"baby proof.\\"  i read that book in one day and loved it. so i hurried and bought \\"something blue\\" i have been so dissapointed in this book. it is clearly a step back (it is her previous book) i honestly find it painful to read. the main character is not only unsympathetic and mean, but she is totally unrealistic. i would definitely skip this one.
B000AU9UYM|4.0|Well - you could label me a little biased - seeing how I am a die-hard Batman fan; however here's what I think of the movie... <br /> <br />1 - The original movie, is, no-doubt, as people dub it - 'the definitive Batman film', and a masterpiece, and without any second thoughts - thee BEST movie of 2005, speaking of ALL movies of 2005. It's story can touch anyone, since it's an origin film, and people don't need to know a thing about Batman, and still discover him in this movie. <br /> <br />2 - The deluxe edition - yeah, there are loads of special features, which I watched all in two to three days; and it's all interesting, amusing (in some cases), and worthwhile. The reason I dock a star off, is because I wish they had more cast interviews about the story, they often talked about stunts in the movie, talking with the Director, but you never really hear all that much what they think of their character, or how they tried to \\"tap into\\" an already previous made character... <br /> <br />3 - Another reason for docking a star, is because there's no commentary; I don't listen to commentaries that much, but seeing how Batman Begins is my \\"NEW FAVORITE MOVIE\\", I'd like to hear at least Christopher Nolan's (and perhaps David S. Goyer - a screenwriter, and Christian Bale, or another actor) comments on scene to scene... <br /> <br />However, Batman Begins is worth the buy - if you aren't as die hard as a fan I am, at least just buy the standard, trimmed DVD with the movie... <br /> <br />- Kevin R.-K. Davis / IDAHO
0446310786|5.0|Harper Lee's book To Kill a Mockingbird is a classic piece of literature read by students everywhere. However, I was not one of those students. It was not on my reading list, much to my regret now. I just finished reading the book and enjoyed it thoroughly. I love Scout's charming point of view and her descriptions of childhood summers make me wish for times past. Justice, or lack of it, is made so real when looked at from the perspective of Scout and her brother Jem. And the dynamic between the kids and the mysterious Boo Radley is just plain cool in the book. <br /> <br />The movie is great too. A classic. The way some of the scenes are portrayed is dead on. I also love how Scout's narration in the book is carried into the movie. It's great to hear Harper Lee's narrative spoken. The charm of Scout's childhood is effectively portrayed visually in the film. I do like the book better for the simple reason that it portrays so much more than the movie ever could. The \\"relationship\\" between the kids and Boo Radley is included in the movie but more fully developed in the book. Because the movie just can't handle it fully, it ends up as a sidestory to the trial instead of a developed storyline all its own as in the book. The movie also couldn't include some of the additional charm of the book - like the storyline with Mrs. Dubose; how the kids feel about Atticus and the Finch family; visiting Calpurnia's church; or how Aunt Alexandra, surprisingly enough, began to have an effect on the lady Scout would become. <br /> <br />Don't get me wrong though, I really did enjoy the movie. The character portrayals were great - especially Scout and Atticus.  But I must say (at the risk of sounding like the girl that I am) that the best part about the movie to me was that it brought the book to life so effectively that in parts I was somewhat emotional. It is a powerful story of childhood and race and justice (or injustice) that cannot be ignored. It speaks to so many in book or filmform. Awesome! Enjoy both!

B000BTC5LW|5.0|I have enjoyed this concert on laserdisc for years, so I was delighted to see that it had finally come to DVD. There is no comparison between the two. In addition to being returned to its (apparently original) 4:3 aspect ratio, the quality of the audio and video are vastly improved.  <br /> <br />The concert itself is delightful, especially for longtime Floyd fans like me. The centerpiece is a complete performance of Dark Side. Comfortably Numb is another highlight.  <br /> <br />The lone low point is the \\"choreography\\" (I use the term loosely) of the three backup singers. Apparently at a loss for anything to do when not singing, they perform a number of slow boogies that are strikingly out of place against this music. This distraction is compounded by the director's decision to highlight them at every opportunity. <br /> <br />Nevertheless, if you already love Pink Floyd, or you'd just like to see this particular variant of rock mega-concerts done as well as possible, this DVD is for you. <br />
B0006IF92U|5.0|This is my first review so hey to all music lovers! I stumbled on Delta with her \\"Lost Without You\\" single. She sucked me in like quicksand, the honesty she portrays in her voice and look got my interest and it grew into a relationship between me and her beautiful music. I found out about the second album when I got back from the army (for which I volunteered a year early) browsing the net. I have the Innocent Eyes album and I wanted to get my hands on Mistaken Identity but it's not available in my country, not commercial enough :( <br />I downloaded the album over shareaza and it's grown on me very much, like a theme for my life experiences. <br />Mistaken Identity review: <br />1. Out Of The Blue = The first single starts of like a gentle breeze and then builds up on the tempo. You feel a plunge when she says \\"Out of the blue\\", like somebody unplugged the sync, her vocals start rushing like bubbly water! She is secretive as to who the person generating energy and uncontrollable emotions is... The video is unusual though, everything sets on fire! A good song, but it's just a cherry toping the great sweet surprise that is this album! (26) <br />2. The Analyst = Great piano kick start draws attention! It's about analyzing, going back in time, something in the human nature that is a pattern for most people, the skeptic in us. I like the line: <br />\\"Can you be sure we haven't met see the eyes they don't forget, they wander through the passage-ways that tease a restless mind\\". <br />A wise in-lighting song that creates enchantment with the mystery of it, voices whispered. We can't resist putting everything in question, what is, and why is. Kind of a wake up song, she sings of her self in the third person. (44) <br />3. Mistaken Identity = This is about Delta not coming to peace with the changes her cancer brought. I find it appealing `cause I've had a similar experience. The part pin pointing the message is the stanza: <br />\\"The sun likes to rise and the moon likesto fall <br />And that's kind like my life <br />Now I've played the role of the nice girl next door <br />Who gets cut like a knife! <br />Now I'm not looking for apology eyes, <br />And I don't want to spend a night on a bed of beautiful lies <br />Erase and rewind leave that sick girl behind, <br />And fast forward, fast forward\\" <br />Saying she's aware of her condition, but she won't let it define the way she carries on about herself, don't give me those looks, don't make me feel that way, that's not me, don't mistake us! This song certainly helped me coming home from the operation and facing the family more bravely! Nice one Delta! (26) <br />4. Sanctuary = Also cancer related, the song is about finding some stability in a world a new harsh reality made a mess of, there is someone with all the strength we need and a warm caring heart that understands and gives comfort. An ok song. (18) <br />5. A Little Too Late = Now this is refreshing! Sort of juvenile but the topic of such fine feelings and Deltas innocent juicy voice gives the song a premise that is adorable and incredibly true! It stands off from the other songs, its light and uplifting like it was taken from the Innocent Eyes album. I don't know if there was a video, but I found out it was a single. (42) <br />6. Be Strong = This starts off breezy like Out Of The Blue but goes on more interesting. It creeps into you as she starts to get more intense with the verses. It's a tribute to anyone who's had it rough, anyone who's been broken and thought of giving up. Getting up after a blow is not easy but it evokes a change in the way we see things, we get up more prepared and face difficulties with strength we renewed from the experience. Gets a strong point across. (39) <br />7. Last Night On Earth = Maters of the heart. The piano trade mark at the beginning, but as the song progresses Delta steers an interesting course! I see a whole movie listening to this song and it's such a great love story. Big wordslike: <br />\\"I'm gonna love you like it's the last night on EARTH\\", and <br />\\"Let's knock down the walls of IMMORTALITY\\" give this song an edge that's overstepping all worldly limitations, like time, space, and mater. Love is the prevailing power! (53) <br />8. Almost Here (Ft. Brian McFadden) = Delta in a duet!? Ain't that somethin'. I was intoxicated with this song by my mum. Every time the video came on, she would pump up the volume, how could I miss it? I feel tingles when Deltas vocals come in, it's the high point of the song, she comes in like an angel and saves this song. They make a good couple and I guess they were just that. The song leaves a great memory to look back on a relationship. (31) <br />9. Miscommunication = Ouuuhh... What a great vibe!! I like to think this song is part two for the one before, explaining the cause to the end of a love affair. It's definitely about a relationship going sour. Everybody can relate to this song, miscommunication is a bump you eventually hit on the road. Her ouuhhing at the end of the song gives me goose-pumps. It's cool! (47) <br />10. Electric Storm = This comes as an explosion! I mean WOW! What a knocker this track turned out to be! Such power in her voice! The Electric Storm is a turbulent relationship. Fantastic lyrics and the way Delta delivers her vocals over a great piano layer strike like lightening! The song carries a strong meaningful message of heartache. Everything in this song fits and makes sense, its perfect! (56) <br />11. Extraordinary Day = This song is so amazing! I fear that putting it into words will take away the beauty of it! It takes over me with a haunting feeling of regret, deep sadness and a sent of death. It's my favorite track because she's pouring out her soul, July the 8th is when Delta found out about her cancer and started facing it. I was surprised at how well she stitched her emotions into words and with how much pain this song is drenched with. I've been in a life threatening situation so I can identify... <br />\\"...And I feel this isolated\\". <br />The sincerity of it gets you, you can feel the emotions build up, and tears come as the song progresses... Truth is best! I will love this song forever! (66) <br />12. Fragile = This song is a prime example of the piano's ability to deliver the most sensitive Hyman emotion - vulnerability. The vocal is charming and loveable, it just gets you in the right place. Eyes are the doors to the soul and Delta is open doors about feeling fragile, feeling alone, feeling not that strong, feeling vulnerable. I never get tired of this song. (56) <br />13. Disorientated = Delta has such an irresistibly cute vocal here that it wins you over immediately! She manages to give diversity to every song, and she put a great twist on this one! It makes me get up, jump and spin around the room with arms wide open, makes me feel good about being disorientated which I am most of the time! We weren't all born with a map of what to do and be in life so it's ok to be disorientated, being young is going for us! Everything comes in its time. (48) <br />14. You Are My Rock = Deltas thank you song to her brother for being there in moments of weakness. The piano does justice to the song. You get the drift of what's it like to be in her shoes, and how much hawing an understanding, helpful brother means. The rock symbolizing the stability he brought. A cruel, sharp ending though: \\"We all need someone until we die\\". (23) <br />15. Nobody Listened = Girl's gone wild! The song is right in your face about the lows of her cancer experience! I like it when she screams! The piano gallops around her voice and the whole song gives you a hot-cold exposure! It's a sister song to \\"Extraordinary Day\\" topics wise, but it cuts both ways. You'll get the message loud and clear, and once the song is over you can breathe again. (40) <br /> <br />I found three tracks from Delta \\"Lost For Words\\", \\"Never Fades Away\\" and \\"Love\\", which are not from the first, or the second album. There's also a live version of the song \\"Together We Are One\\" which she performed at the Commonwealth Games Opening Ceremony, she penned it with Brian McFadden and Guy Chambers. All GREAT songs! <br />Lost For Words = Starts dreamy, the piano kicks in gently and Delta just takes it away like a musical magician. What can I say, I'm lost for words here  I really like this song very much \\"Life is such a wonderful thing, you just never know what life can bring\\" as Delta says. I imagine everybody close to me being in my audience as I join Delta on the lyrics. Thankfully they are only there in my imagination, my voice is of course deeper than Deltas so... Enough said ;) (58) <br />Never Fades Away = This girl sleeps on the piano, and when she wakes up she plays, very beautifully I might say. Arrangement of a Delta song, stereotypical piano. \\"Love is like a song it never fades away\\". She wanted to say something powerful but that just doesn't cut it for me. The song has the makings of a power ballad. Her voice goes high and low and than fades away as the song comes to an end. (32) <br />Love = Daugh. It's about love, love for your family which is always there, while boys come and go. It's a nice song, childish, uplifting. Delta sang this at 14 so no wonder it ends with \\"What is love...\\" I think of my little sister and how much I love her, Dunja here's thinking of you ;) (35) <br />Together We Are One (live) = Deltas come a long way! This is a powerful song! She penned some great verses here: <br />\\"Find your guiding inspiration in a place where dreams are made <br />With a lifetime's preparation, it's no time to be afraid, <br />Put our differences behind us while we're shining like the sun, <br />See what we've all become, together we are one\\". The crowd is singing with her, if only I was there to cheer for her... A standing ovation for this one Delta! (39) <br /> <br />The numbers in brackets are winamp's count of how many times I played thesong. It's within three weeks from when I downloaded the tracks. <br />I hope I didn't over do it. It's just hard to say less when there is so much about her worth mentioning. Maybe I get her so much because I'm just a month older than her. <br />Thanks for the time of day. <br />Enjoy music, it makes life more beautiful!
0312330537|5.0|Excellent read!  I have a new understanding of India.  And, a new favorite author who has captured me with his ability to emmerse the reader into the story.  Difficult book to put down...
B00005CDNJ|5.0|This is a great album, because it has songs on it that aren't available on the Best of Abba album, like \\"Happy New Year\\" and \\"Our Last Summer\\" and \\"Andante, Andante.\\" I'd highly recommend it.
B00000JAKK|5.0|Guitar lovers of all kinds have to get a copy of this album by one whose name has become synonymous with excellent jazz guitar playing.  The tone and clarity of execution shown on this album is a testament to Montgomery's great dexterity and technical prowess as a guitarist.  This album is essential listening for any aspiring jazz guitarist.  This version in mini-lp sleeve design is also a joy to behold and the remastering job is very good resulting in excellent sound quality.  This is the best version of the album that is currently out there.  Recommended.
0449227545|3.0|Ken Follett has written many exciting books.  This is not one.  It doesn't even feel like him - I kept going back to the coverpage to make sure it wasn't written by someone else.
0739308742|4.0|The book is great. I love Mr Martin's writing style. <br /> <br />My issue however is with the audiobook version read by John Lee. <br />He is not ROY DOTRICE. <br /> <br />Mr. Dotrice is a far better reader than John Lee and was sorely missed in A FEAST FOR CROWS. <br /> <br />Listening to the book made me want to read it instead because of how much I missed Roy Dotrice. <br /> <br />If you have listened to the first three like I did instead of reading them than I suggest you read A FEAST FOR CROWS instead. <br /> <br />You will really miss Roy Dotrice's characterizations.
B000G75AE8|4.0|Christ Illusion is a great \\"comeback\\" cd from Slayer, gone are the muddy production values of the last few CDs, replaced by crisp production, pinpoint precision riffs, lottsa tempo changes and to be quite honest just better songs this time around. Lombardo being back in the fold is a plus also, Paul Bostaph is not missed here. Some of the songs here seem to be from the \\"bad guys\\" point of view, namely Jihad and Supremist. But hey, I wont hold that against them !! This CD, in my opinion, has a more convincing \\"evil\\" feel to it, being that the guys are now older, with more life experience behind the anger presented here. Kerry King is one pissed off fella and man the lyrics reflect it !! The biggest plus is the production. Dave Lombardos double bass drums kick, and the cymbals are crisp. The production reminds us of the the peak \\"Rubin\\" era, and as executive producer on this one, Im sure his input was well taken. Theres been some reviews out there saying its more of the same from these guys, and in my opinion, thats a good thing !!
B000002H1T|5.0|just when some had written the Cars off -- rumors at the time said the band couldn't even remember the lyrics in tour rehearsals -- they come back with one of their best albums. <br /> <br />this nails the cars' winning formula of catchy pop songs with eccentric, dark undercurrents that provide edge. the tight musicianship, strong vocals and songcraft are all in evidence. provided a great soundtrack for the summer of 84.
6305558167|5.0|Coleridge is alleged to have envisioned Kubla Khan in a dream. this is an extraordinary thing that may happen to a gifted artist once in a lifetime and I propose that this movie is John Boorman's Kubla Khan. The whole thing unfolds before your eyes as if you are in a dream. And I don't mean this in a non-real sense. I mean this in the sense that it borders on that place where dream becomes a religious epiphany. This is a very powerful movie. There are images and moments in this movie that will ingrain themselves on you forever. Scenes like Uthur Pendragon (Arthur's father) in full armor clinking wounded through mud and forcing Excalibur into a stone. Or a long shot of two knights battling with maces, or a race through an apple blossom field. And of course there is the lady in the lake and the Round Table itself. Yet through all of this you get the ring of truth around the people and the setting. There are no elaborate sets designed in Hollywood. (Except maybe for Merlin's Lair) Everything feels as if it were filmed right where the legend supposedly happens. This is one of those movies that everyone has to see. But it is not a popcorn movie. Put the kids to bed then wait an hour for the worries of the world to fade then go into it with an open mind.
B000002LPD|5.0|Van Halen is my favorite band behind Pink Floyd,So one day i desided to buy all of their albums. I picked up For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge for one cent plus shipping and expected it to be mediocre. Instead I discovered three of my top ten favorite Van Halen songs and my favorite VH avlbum besides Van Halen 1. <br /> <br />The Album opens up with Poundcake, with some of the best background guitar work I have ever heard from Van Halen. <br /> <br />The second track is my fifth favorite Van Halen song, Judgement day. It just spews energy and makes you want to sing out loud or just go and kill something. <br /> <br />The best song on the album is the most underated song on the album, Dream another Dream.  <br /> <br />Another note is 316, which was turned into one of the best live guitar solos ever. <br /> <br />If you want to hear solid hard rock with great vocals and better guitar, F.U.@.K is the album for you.
B000FS9FCG|5.0|Without ever having read the comic, I had no preconceptions about V for Vendetta when I walked into the the theater. All I knew was that it starred Hugo Weaving in a weird mask and Natalie Portman with a shaved head. I was expecting an action/adventure movie in the same category as Zorro, but what I got was much, much more.<br /><br />Oh yes, there is plenty of action and adventure as the mysterious V slashes his way through the elite of London society, but to look at the movie only as an action flick is to miss the entire point-- the movie is the story of what happens in a totalitarian society when the government becomes too suspicious of the people. There's enough political relevance in the film to make some people today very uncomfortable.<br /><br />There are so many levels on which this movie can be watched-- it is very violent so parents of young children should be advised, but it is also a tender love story and a story of strength and courage and what happens when one stands firm in one's beliefs. I do know that the 1812 Overture will never sound the same to me again, and that the 5th of November will now have a different meaning in my life-- this is a life changing movie and a life affirming movie. For that may indeed by V's ultimate point-- life is too short not to live it thoroughly and without fear.
B0001XAPX8|4.0|Anthony Hopkins and Nicole Kidman are two of my favourite actors. You have already read the synopsis and the editor's report so I won't bore you with the details. I found this film very enjoyable and good entertainment. A good plot and first class acting.

1594200823|4.0|I found this book fascinating until the final section.  Peter Singer and the animal rights' folks offer one perspective on vegetarianism but certainly not the only one.  Pollan is slow to acknowledge the political and environmental reasons for not eating meat, let alone -- dare I say it -- the spiritual or religious reasons for such avoidance.  (Indeed, his discussion of the way meat is most often produced in the US would seem to provide reasons enough.)  The last section seemed rushed, poorly argued, and self-involved -- a disappointing and tedious finish to an otherwise fine book.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I first saw the movie Serenity and just loved it!!!  Then found the 11 original episodes on Amazon.  As I discovered this show has obtained a major cult following.  If you haven't seen the original TV episodes or the movie, it is a must.  All the stories are well written, character driven adventures you can't get enough of.  Si-fi with a western twist is strange but it works.  The problem is I've watched them all and now I am wanting more.  I hope they make another movie.  Until then, you must give this a look...I was not disappointed.  You will not be either.

1577314808|5.0|One reviewer pointed out that Tolle does not describe how to enter the now, or the mechanics and practices of identifying the pain-body and then seeing it dissipate.  I would suggest respectfully that readers should read this book and then read The Heart of the Soul by Gary Zukav, which is quite direct in the discussion of locating pain energy and removing it (the process of identifying it automatically leads to its removal, if I may characterize it thusly).   <br /> <br />This book is powerful when combined with Zukav's prescriptives.
B00005JN2Z|3.0|Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx show off their acting talents in a movie with an unlikely premise and an even more unlikely conclusion.  Foxx is a N.Y. cabdriver whose customer just happens to be a beautiful female attorney who just happens to give him her phone number, a move which happens to figure prominently in the plot later on.  Cruise is a hired killer who decides that Foxx will drive him from hit to hit, much against Jamie's will.  Murder and mayhem may keep the viewer's attention but when the dust clears it's obvious that the basic premise is so unlikely that it spoils the overall effect of the movie.
B000AQBA1W|1.0|The Corrs are insanely talented Irish musicians.  Their background and talents have for years begged the question that they produce a roots album.  Purportedly, this album, \\"Home\\", is the result.  <br /> <br />If you enjoy the superscrubbed, sterile, overproduced sound of their pop albums, then you will enjoy this album.  As usual, there is not a single spontaneous note on the whole album, and no risks were taken.  The Corrs have the potential to make an electrifying Irish roots album, but \\"Home\\" is not it.  For starters they would need to ditch their usual producer, Mitchell Froom, who also produced \\"Home\\".  Froom is a decidedly pop producer, and, unfortunately, a pop album is what he and the Corrs have produced. Given their enormous potential, this album is, thus, a huge disappointment for those awaiting a roots album from the Corrs.
B0000067L2|5.0|Some kids love rap cause it makes them feel cool.  Some kids love metal/thrash punk cause they want to be cool. Then there is music ....then there is Masterpieces and other albums that are on the Rolling Stone 500 Albums list. Describing Disraeli Gears is pointless, Getting a top quality pair of Headphones and fully listening to this gem is my suggestion.
B00005JOUM|3.0|Director:  Spike Lee <br />Cast:  Denzel Washington, Clive Owen, Jodie Foster, Christopher Plummer, Willem Dafoe, Chiwetel Ejifor, Carlos Andres Gomez, Kim Director, James Ransome. <br />Running Time: 129 minutes <br />Rated R for language and some violence. <br /> <br />Spike Lee is one of the most consistent directors out there. Save for some more uneven pictures like \\"She Hate Me\\" and \\"Girl 6\\", Lee's body of work is just plain impressive. And while \\"Inside Man\\" is not up there with \\"Do The Right Thing\\", \\"Malcolm X\\" and \\"Clockers\\", it is definitely an entertaining and intelligent thriller that does things a little differently than most cookie cutter thrillers you see in theaters nowadays.  A bank robbery in New York has gotten out of control, and it's up to police detective Keith Frazier (Denzel Washington) to act as hostage negotiator and get the bank personal and customers out safely before things turn even worse than they already are. This turns out to be a tough case, since the leader of the bank robbers, Dalton Russell (Clive Owen), turns out to be a very smart individual, who has everything planned to perfection, and who throws up surprise after surprise for Frazier and his men. But while the people around Frazier are slowly getting more and more nervous, he himself does not lose his mind, and begins a high stakes battle of wits with Russell. Things are further complicated, however, when the mayor of New York introduces a mysterious woman to Frazier. This woman (Jodie Foster) wants to protect something that is hidden in one of the safety deposit boxes inside the bank, and she will stop at nothing to force Frazier to let her inside the bank and make sure nothing happens to the contents. <br /> <br />This all sounds like an intriguing premise for a thriller, but the movie goes a few steps further than just having an interesting plot, because while \\"Inside Man\\" does hit all the right notes when it comes to keeping you guessing about what is really going on, itis also very successful in mixing the grittier moments with comedy elements. At times, Inside Man is very funny, but in a way that does not deflate the tension. The dialogue is sharp, with the conversations between Frazier and Russell being especially fascinating, and both actors are at the top of their game in this film. Washington's Frazier is an intense but laconic individual, who has a permanent smirk on his face but who reads the bank robbers intentions better than anybody else, while Owen is charismatic and fascinating as the mastermind behind the bank robbery. Unfortunately, Jodie Foster's role is lackluster. While her part is potentially fascinating, she does not really get the chance to do anything with it other than look cool and act tough. Yes, we all know that she is very good at that, but with a bit more background story, and a bit more screen time, her part could have been even more interesting.  With \\"Inside Man\\", Lee showcases an interesting way of directing thrillers. He ignores the usual build up that you see in thrillers, which consists of an introduction, a chronological development of the main intrigue, followed by a final act in which everything is wrapped up neatly (even flashing forward several times, thus revealing some important developments before they have happened), and this only serves to make Inside Man a movie that is more than your regular suspense movie.  This unique approach is intriguing and enjoyable, even though it does take quite a long time to wrap things up at the end.   <br />
B0000029AL|4.0|This is the album that started it all. When it was released in 1973 it was given virtually no publicity, no airplay, nothing. Columia was more focused on Bruce Springsteen's debut album at the time and after Aerosmith's self-titled debut they were considered to be dropped from the label completely. While far from their best, this is a great Aerosmith album. This album is raw, it's bluesy down to the bone which is what Aerosmith were all about. It wasn't about precision, it was about attitude, and man they did it well. Each record following this would get better until they peaked at 1976's Rocks. This is a great album for any Aerosmith fan. <br /> <br />Make It: 6/10 \\"Good evenin' people welcome to the show\\"  <br />Somebody: 5/10 In my opinion a pretty weak track, though it has it's moments <br />Dream On: 50/10 Here we are, the ultimate Aerosmith song, I could go on forever, in my eyes this is the greatest song of all time, the lyrics, the guitars, the euphoric energy of it all, buy the album if only for this one pivotal song <br />One Way Street: 10/10 my second favorite off of the album, great swagger <br />Mama Kin: 10/10 a 'smith favorite <br />Write Me: 6/10 a decent song but it doesn't stand out <br />Movin'Out: 9/10 first song Steven Tyler and Joe Perry wrote together, albeit not a masterpiece, a wonderful song <br />Walkin' The Dog: a great cover to close the album <br /> <br />This may not be the best Aerosmith album but it's far from being the worst. If you're looking for raw bluesy rock, this is your album. Check Out My reviews for Get Your Wings, Toys In The Attic, and Rocks <br />
B00000JZC4|5.0|Well, Filter did it this time. They were able to put out something that has much more of a variety among each track. \\"Short Bus\\" was good but this is just a lot better. It's filled with great tracks throughout the entire record. What I've noticed with some average albums is that when it isn't amazing it's usually due to not enough variety among tracks. \\"Title of Record\\" continues to have great tracks throughout the entire cd and not just one or two either. From the hard crunching sound of the opener \\"Welcome To The Fold\\" to the soft melodies of \\"Take A Picture\\" it's all good. There's just so much to enjoy with this release. My favorite tracks would probably be \\"Welcome To The Fold\\", \\"Skinny\\", \\"The Best Things\\" and \\"Take My Picture\\". Here's what I think of everything else... (excluding 1st track)<br /><br />2. Welcome To The Fold - 10/10<br />3. Captain Bligh - 9.5/10<br />4. It's Gonna Kill Me - 9.5/10<br />5. The Best Things - 10/10<br />6. Take A Picture - 10/10<br />7. Skinny - 10/10<br />8. I Will Lead You - 9.5/10<br />9. Cancer - 10/10<br />10. I'm Not The Only One - 10/10<br />11. Miss Blue - 8/10<br /><br />Overall: 96% A<br /><br />Overall this album just has so much variety among tracks to offer. It has a few songs sticking to the \\"Short Bus\\" style as well as showing a softer side, which is just as awesome. This is the record where the band really starts to show what its all about. If you are a Deftones, NIN, or Tool fan you may like this. Give this a few listens and I'm sure you will find something you will like on it.
B000002IOW|5.0|Some would say that Rush hit their apex with &quot;Moving Pictures.&quot; Certainly their next two albums after that were good, but they were far from &quot;Permanent Waves&quot; and &quot;Hemispheres.&quot; The only problem was that music and Rush was still evolving, and some of the loyal Rush listeners did not take to kindly to this evolution. However, Rush showed that a band could change and still be great. From start to finish, this album is superb. Geddy's unique and outstanding vocals, Alex's incredible guitar playing and Mr. Peart's thundering drums. The lyrics reflect a more mature Peart and the CD closes with one of Rush's most beautiful and inspiring songs. A great album by one of the greatest bands ever.
B000056OBA|5.0|Having always been a fan of Herbert von Karajan (and Beethoven, obviously) I am very happy to have this 5 CD set. The reproduction is crystal clear and the music is, well, Beethoven. Von Karajan has long been recognized as one of the worlds greatest conductors as well as being a Beethoven expert. I suppose that one could say that this is the music the way Ludwig would have wanted it. Somewhat more sostenuto than younger and more modern conductors might play it, but, I feel, perhaps the way it should be played. <br />If you are looking for an outstanding classic rendition of the 9 Symphonies (and a gorgeous rendition ofthe Ode to Joy), then by all means this is the set for you.
0060934913|5.0|Drugs, sex, alcohol along with the best and the worst of the chef's kitchen is just PART of what you will find in this book. For those who have watched Anthony Bourdain on the Food channel and most recently on the Travel channel, you can 'hear' his voice as you are reading the pages. His descriptions and wit bring you right there as he is telling the story.<br /><br />Highly entertaining, I enjoyed the ride.<br /><br />Plus, I'd love to run my fingers through his hair....I know. It's weird, but I still want to......I can't help it....
B00003CXCW|5.0|Most pictures do seem small compared to this movie. A true classic that seems to define the word classic, the film holds up so well after all this time that to watch it now is like watching it for the first time. Billy Wilder's genius is so awe-inspiring. This film is his true masterpiece, and Norma Desmond is his Mona Lisa. GLoria Swanson is so pitch-perfect in this movie, whenever you see her in anything else she worked in, you expect her to say \\"I'm ready for my close-up\\". William Holden is spot-on in his portrayal of Joe Gillis, an out-of-work, down on his luck writer in Hollywood. Nancy Olsen as also fine in her role as the sweet girl Joe falls for, starting Norma's descent into madness out of jealousy. It was intrigueing to see Erich Von Strohem in this film portraying Norma's former husband and director, as Von Stroheim had actually directed Swanson earlier in their careers, in an episode neither remembered with affection. The transfer to DVD was done beautifully, with wonderful contrast in light and shade, and excellant sound clarity. The extra features are spot-on, as well, with a solid \\"making of\\" featurette, and a great documentary on Billy Wilder. From beginning to end, this film holds a viewer under a spell, drawing a great variety of reactions. So get this DVD, and enjoy one of the great cinema classics of all time.
B000C3H4M2|5.0|\\"Fear of Music\\" is one of Talking Heads' best albums. This deluxe edition on the surface is a great way to hear the album. If you'll be listening to only the 5.1 side of the disc it will play just fine in computers and on DVD-Audio players. Conventional CD players may have a hard time recognizing the disc though. On the packaging it doesn't carry the compact disc logo. What that means is that the disc isn't blue book compatible and won't play in all players.<br /><br />For example the CD portion wouldn't play on my computer. This made it impossible to listen to on my ipod (which is the primary way I listen to stuff on the road now). The 5.1 side plays just fine but you can't upload it to your iPod either. Why Warner didn't release this like this did overseas (1 remastered CD disc and the other a 5.1 remastered DVD-Audio disc) is beyond me. Certainly Dualdisc offers a lot of potential but many of these won't play on a lot of higher end CD players.<br /><br />It's just something to be aware of when purchasing this. Rhino is not replacing the discs with remastered versions as they consider the problem to be minor. If you contact Dr. Rhino at Rhino's website they'll insist that you pay for shipping and handling when sending in the disc or you can try and return it to your local store or amazon.com. Until they work out all of the kinks with Dualdisc just be cautious.
B000286S8S|5.0|I can't say enough about this compiltation, but I'll start off with three simple points.    1. \\"The Best of Both Worlds\\" is the most fitting title that could possibly be conceived for this compilation.    2. It also curiously makes it the first Greatest Hits album ever with a title track.    3. Van Halen, with Dave or Sammy at the front, are one of the greatest hard rock bands of all time.    Enjoy.    EDIT: It turns out that my first \\"fact\\" was in fact incorrect, as Pink Floyd's Best Of compilation has a title track of its own, Echoes.  So sue me

1573223026|4.0|This was my first Honby novel, and I was definitely not disappointed. The flow from character to character was both easy and charming. I felt an attachment to each complex personality almost immediately. The most enjoyable aspect of this book is the witty and fresh dialogue. I must however criticize the depth of the plot, a bit more conflict and this book would have been a must read.  <br /> <br />In all, a very entertaining book that left me hungry for more of the Author's work. <br />
B000G75AE8|5.0|It seems to me the original Slayer lineup has motivated these guys to stray away from the God Hates and Diabolous sounds and back to the good ol' days where Slayer reigned upon the thrash metal throne...Dave Lombardo coming back to Slayer is more than a blessing...every song on this cd reminds me of something Slayer could've put out in the 80's and early 90's....Christ Illusion is chock full of Slayer's best riffs, drumming, and Tom Araya's screamed vocals...Kerry King and Jeff Hanneman shred their guitars like always while Dave Lombardo shows why he is called \\" The Human Drum Machine\\"....Slayer is back with a mean vengeance and shows that a band 25 years old can still put out good albums even if the band members are in their 40's....Christ Illusion is a definitive comeback to the old skool and better Slayer...will not dissapoint long time fans!!!
B00006CXSS|5.0|I agree with many of the reviews that state this is one of the best portraits of men in battle ever made.  It is surpurbly acted and directed and the cinematography is first rate.  The only thing I have to add is READ THE BOOK!  Band of Brothers is perhaps the best book Stephen Ambrose wrote.  It is a truely excellent work based on interviews with the men of Easy Company and Ambrose's historical research and it gives you an even richer context when you watch the mini-series.
B000G75AE8|4.0|Sure it's not the Slayer of old, but CHRIST ILLUSION is pretty friggin' good. At first listen I thought the CD was just ok, but now after my fourth time through it - I think the CD is really, really strong. Lombardo is incredible as always. Araya's vocals coulda been better, but oh well. Jihad track rules. Get off your @ss and pick it up. <br /> <br /> <br />+++++SLAYER+++++
0743539133|5.0|I loved this book.  I could not put it down.  I absolutely recommend it to anyone with an interest in Abraham Lincoln, the Civil War or American History.
B000058983|2.0|I bought this album not long after its original release on vinyl.  My own opinion:  Arthur Lee didn't have much of a voice, his lyrics had all the subtlety and poetry of a jackhammer, David Angel's arrangements are some of the cheesiest ever recorded, and The Red Telephone and You Set the Scene are among the most embarrassingly awful songs in rock history.  I'll never understand why many people now think this is a great album.  It was undeniably creative in places but also hopelessly heavy-handed, and most of it literally makes me cringe.  Other than Alone Again Or, I really *never* want to hear any of these songs again.  To put this on the same footing with the best of Tim Buckley and Nick Drake is laughable in my view, let alone the Beatles and Dylan.

B000062XE1|5.0|What can I say?  If you like Oscar Wilde, you will enjoy these DVDs.
B000G75AE8|5.0|<br />  In my opinion the best album since \\"Divine Intervention\\". Very good all the way!!! A thrash non-stop assault, Henneman and King put incredible amounts of riff after riffs, Dave Lombardo as always shows his talent and Tom Araya sounds very pissed off!!!! The lyrics are good also, fron politics to religion. Slayer finally pleased all their fans!!!
B00005JNY4|5.0|Finally a good remake that is a little different. What makes a movie is the scenery, least my opinion. Scenery was beautiful. But the deep was a classic but the updated version is good for the new age crowd which makes sense

B0000TB01Y|5.0|Since many of the reviewers had seen the show before buying the soundtrack, I wanted to say that I really enjoy the soundtrack even though I haven't seen the show.  I first took it out of the library and found a number of the songs really catchy and I had to buy it.  The original cast, heard on the album, is incredibly talented.  My favorite songs are \\"Defying Gravity,\\" \\"Dancing Through Life\\" and \\"Popular.\\"  I hope to see the show, but the soundtrack is entertaining on its own merits.
B00005JKG5|4.0|This movie still rocks after all these years since it first came out.  An excellent and energetic movie from the start. Plot is cutesy.  It serves as a vehicle for the wonderful selection of songs and dance sequences.  However, I think this version of the movie is missing a few scenes?  I would rate this movie version with 5 stars had it been unedited to me. <br /> <br />If memory serves me, didn't Alex receive a letter from her friend, Hannah, when Alex discovered Hannah passed away?  Isn't there a reconnection at the end between Mickey and Alex's (girl)friend whom the latter was dating?  Wasn't there more of a story build-up between Alex and her boss?  If this version is cut in anyway, I prefer getting the complete and unedited version.  I find this version incomplete somehow. <br /> <br />But Jennifer Beals looks terrific and one wonders why she didn't star in more movies for her generation.
B000GTLQXU|3.0|This Director made movies such as troy and perfect storm and they were at least 2 hours or longer. He put a story in them even though they were both bad, and here we got a movie that NEEDED a story. They had about 15mins of actually getting to know each charicter and then the ship starts to flip over. what the .........Not to fair that directors now or days just give up on giving a movie a story and just start in to the action. They fool you in the movie trailers by showing kurt and the guys playing poker and the big party scene like there is going to be MAYBE AT LEAST a whole hour of going through the whole boat, kinda like titanic and then another hour and a half which is what the running time was, putting in the action at that time. I give it three stars only because #1 was a good nerve racking movie that kept you on the edge. #2 good visual effects. #3 It was shown in IMAX. But other than all of this... I am very ashamed of wolfgang not putting at least a couple of hours in a movie that is HUGE and expected to at least have a storyline.
B000E97Y6A|3.0|Peter Jackson needs to be careful, because he could easily be pigeon-holed into the lengthy, dramatic, overly ambitous director role.  Believe you me, it paid off in spades with the Lord of the Rings movies.  But when taking on a story that's only half as big as Kong himself, the pattern needs to be altered. <br /> <br />I'm not saying Jackson's remake-of-a-remake \\"King Kong\\" is a bad movie, because I honestly don't think it is.  But when the movie came out, it was hailed as an instant classic, the best movie of the year, and possibly the best movie of the 2000's.  That's simply not true either.  It's been quite a long while since the movie came out, has hit the small screen, the anticipation hype has cleared, so we can now take a step back and view the film with a little more objectivity. <br /> <br />The movie is basically divided into three parts, neatly compartmentalized by it's three hours.  (Jackson works in three's, remember).  The first hour is an absolute bore.  In the theater, I had trouble understanding the superfluous character developement, but now that it's out on DVD it seems downright unnecessary.  I think I may know where it stems from, though.  When Jackson took on Tolkein's books, the character developement was needed; these were hobbits, dwarfs, elves, AND humans in a fictional world trying to dispose of a powerful, magical ring in the terrifying, evil Mordor.  \\"Kong\\" is a struggling director, actress, and filmwriter who get on a boat.  \\"Make mention of it and move on,\\" should have been the rule of the day.  Instead, Jackson draws out absolutely everything.  Most painful of all is how almost nothing happens in that hour.  Yes, it needs to be shown that Ann and Jack start to dig each other, but that shouldn't take an hour. <br /> <br />The second hour is the crowning achievement.  We arrive at Skull Island, meet the savage natives, Ann is offered up to an 80 foot tall gorilla, and the crew go in after her.  Still, barring how fantastically realistic Kong looks, nothing much is new or different from the two versions of King Kong available.  But as the crew goes further into \\"the last blank spot on the map,\\" it becomes apparent WHY Jackson chose to do the film in the first place.  Brontosaurases, Raptors, T-Rexes, and Bugs to boot abound in the fantastic island all so detailed that it harrows up rememberance of Jackson's greatness showcased in the greatest Trilogy of all-time.  That flame of interest and amazement is quickly stomped out after Jack \\"rescues\\" Ann and the beast is cholorformed and brought back to New York. <br /> <br />The fundamental dichotomy between a fantasy island and 1930's New York City is a lot of what kills the fun of the movie.  I understand that NYC has to be realistic and it is.  But Jackson excels when he shows his audience a world that doesn't exist.  Kong escapes from the stage, runs amock, and finally finds Ann.  From here on out, it's everything you think of when someone metions the words \\"King Kong,\\" and there's a reason.  It's been done before.  He climbs a building, is shot at, and falls to save Ann.  Obviously, the purpose is to show humanities savage side, but as Kong is crushing cars, destroying buildings, and killing hundreds of people, the viewer wonders what else could humans do with an unstoppable, building-tall animal that kills his friends. <br /> <br />The movie is good.  But not Lord of the Rings good.  I understand that it's apples and oranges, but it had the POTENTIAL to be a great movie.  But as the minute marker runs past three hours, one wonders how much of the first and last hour could have been condensed. <br /> <br />Overall:  6 out of 10.
B000E33VWW|5.0|Capote tells the details of the three years period in wich Truman  wrotte his more sucessfull novel \\"In cold Blood\\" based in real life facts, two killers Perry Smith and Richard Hickock convicted and accused of the brutal murder on an entyre family in a quiet farm in the outside of a peacefull little town, they wanted to steal 10,000 usd they believed this family had and they ended staling between 40 or 50 usd that was everything this family really had and at the end they kill all the family members to not being accused, the case was heard in the whole country , specially when the criminals were captured, Capote shows interest in knowing the facts and the murderers version to writte a new novel, so he travel to this town to interview the criminals but he achieves this process playing a double game, in part becoming friend of this two men telling them he wants to tell their side of the storie wich could have an influence in the trial result and in other hand he described the facts in a dramatic way that tells the development of the storie as really happened wich could turn the public opinion even more against the accused, the long and exaustive legal process last more than three years in wich Capote have to postergate the release of this anticipated work because somehow he develops a co-dependency and affection by knowing this two young men specially Smith and therefore he didnt wanted them to know the real orientation he gave to the novel and he depended of their execution to not offer explanations about it, at the end the accused are executed and Truman experiments remorse for not helping them and using the relationship for his artistics goal, in one hand the human spirit and in other hand the ambition,  this two factors collide dramatically in the process of the writting of \\"In Cold Blood\\". <br /> <br />Phillip Seymur Hoffman is brilliant in his interpretation. <br /> <br />HM
B00005JOML|1.0|What a waste of my hard earned $10.00. <br /> <br />I was a huge fan of the Miami Vice TV series in the 80's, I still have every single episodes of MV on beta tapes. Although, my beta machine no long works, thanks to DVD, I can watch the first two seasons over and over again until season three comes out. <br /> <br />When I first heard of Miami Vice the movie, I was hoping that it would turn out to be another one of Michael Mann's classic stylish movie like the Thief, Heat and Collateral. But I walked out of the movie theater totally disappointed. <br /> <br />While the TV series were built on Crockett and Tubb's partnership - season one's pilot episode, and their friendship - season one's \\"Evan\\" episode, the movie has none of that. There were absolutely no chemistry between the two stars. Instead of building on the two's relationship, Mann wasted half of the movie on Crockett's romantisizing Isabella. <br /> <br />As for the gun battles, there was no comparisn to Heat's bank heist's sequence.
B0002CHIJW|5.0|A lot of these older horror films fall into the rut of being slow involving little dialogue with long stretches of setup for the messes, but I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE manages to have enough intrigue to hold on. I have a horrible attention span for movies, usually finishing them in several sittings or not at all, but this one was definitely a sitdown watch it all the way through movie. <br /> <br />Obviously, it is about rape and revenge. It's incredibly graphic in the rape, and just as heartless. Then it's those long stretches of setup, but the payoff is great as we see her inflict double the terror upon her assailants.
B00005O438|1.0|I give it one star for the dvd. I give the movie 5 stars or more if I could. Starting out is, everyone who is a die hard fan of this movie knows this is suppose to be a widescreen motion picture. hell even on TNT high definition tv, they aired it in the right aspect so I had to tape it because ive never got to see it in its actual aspect. Second of all the box art gives the whole movie away. being reason I say this is because of the poster art of the movie and the old warner vhs tape shows no sign of what kind of creature is cujo. I know it might not be a big deal to some people but when I first rented this movie, I was so curious about what CUJO was, The box art and original theatrical poster art was so unique that you were guessing what kind of horror is this. Well I know people are going to say, READ THE BOOK DUMMY and you will know. Well I am not a book reader but I was so excited to know what kind of killer was CUJO and was a dog, I kinda had a hunch though. This movie is fantastic. One of those kinds that you could just sit there and feel that everything on the show was really actually happening and not just acting. That is a good movie! One last thing. Dont go buying this peice of junk dvd. wait until warner releases the true format and maybe some extra features to go along. THey did it with the classic. Lost boys
B00097DX3U|3.0|Chris is great, the band is great... the two are not compatible! <br />Chris should shop around for a better back-up band!  His voice is lost in the band's attempt to outdo one another.
B000G75AE8|5.0|Band = sweet<br /><br />Album = fast, awesome, heavy, fantastic<br /><br />You = the jury's still out<br /><br />Me = freakin' rockin' out to SLAYER busta<br /><br />Lineup = this is the origional slayer lineup, nuf said.<br /><br />Don't be a fool...see you at the next in-your-face, cutthrought, tear-you-to-shreads Slayer show...unless you're well, yuppy pop-culture obsessed-with-the-trends and ballad-laiden mainstream rock radio listening loser...like I said the jury is out:  by the album.  Slayer rules.
0743424425|4.0|I read the book a few months ago and I summarize that it is really good but the book drags on a bit and has a few \\"too graphic and disgusting\\" for my taste scenes. I liked the two adaptations (especially the Stanley Kubrick adaptation) better than I liked the book. If you are really in to Stephen King stories then this is for you.
0895260131|5.0|Very well written. I was unable to find any falsehoods while reading along with a copy of the Koran. Ms. Robertson (below) feels otherwise. However, she doesnt state where the author is wrong about what he has written. The answer to that is because he isn't wrong or biased and he is stating only facts and comparisons with Biblical doctrine. Unfortunately many Americans share her beliefs because the truth is just too scary to believe and it is much easier to keep their heads in the sand instead of believing that another religion can be based on so much violence and hatred. Well done Mr. Spencer. A must read for all western society.
1573226521|4.0|What this book basically involves is travel fiction - a make believe adventure of a believable episode of a young man in southeast asia.  Bogs down a little in the middle but overall flows nicely.  If you are looking for a super-creepy book, look elsewhere - it doesn't get too crazy until the very end.  If you like fiction and yearn for the few remaining secluded travel destinations left on the globe, pick this one up.
0671799320|1.0|(Hey, this review is supposed to be 5 stars! What's up with the editing?)      O. K.     Get ready.     Take a ...deeeeeeep ....breath.....     This book, written in 1991, is about to become relevant again!    Yergin's \\"hydrocarbon man\\" is alive and well and living in the 21st century.  No book has ever captured the excitement, risk, and reward of the oil business like this volume does. Daniel Yergin documents oil patch history, from the simple beginnings as a native american medicine to todays complex international traffiking.  Truely, hydrocarbon extraction from the subsurface is the stuff of modern life.  Try to live without the carbon-hydrogen bond and you'll find out what life is like with an odd-even social-security-number lottery for the gas chamber. (Maybe I exaggerate a bit, but trust me... you don't want to look down this road.)    My advice:    Buy this book!     Buy it today!     Read it as soon as you receive it!     The next day may be too late!      (As I write this, gasoline prices rose today by about 8 cents because of the Alaskan pipeline.)       Also, thank your local geologist. And buy him a beer.
B00005UEAR|5.0|And here we have Dream Theater. After an attempt at commercial breakthrough with the album Falling Into Infinity, an album that isn't all too well regarded among progressive metal fans, Dream Theater went back to the writing style that made them so famous with Scenes from a Memory. With this concept album, Dream Theater redeemed themselves among their fans. And they continued this with the stunning 2002 effort 6 Degrees of Inner Turbulence.  <br /> <br />The first disc of 6DOIT is much, much heavier than anything Dream Theater had put out to that point (yes, even Awake). The first track, The Glass Prison, is the best example. I would have never thought I could ever use the world brutal to describe a Dream Theater song, but in parts, the definiton fits completely. My personal favorite part of the song is the arpeggios John Petrucci plays early in the song. Very, very awesome. <br /> <br />The next two songs, Blind Faith, never really stood out much to me. But they aren't bad songs overall. There are some very cool moments spread throughout the two tracks. <br /> <br />But I love the song that follows it. The Great Debate, as the song is called, is a John Petrucci writing effort about stem cell research. Very clever lyrical moments, and the music itself is great. <br /> <br />Disappear sounds a little bit like Space Dye Vest part II, but I don't mind it at all. There are some very tender and beautiful moments throughout the song. <br /> <br />Now disc 2 is where some of the best stuff of Dream Theater's career is. This is the disc I listen to the most. This is where bombast, indulgence, dynamics and everything in between collides perfectly to make one of the best progressive musical moments ever. This is probably Dream Theater's magnum opus. <br /> <br />From the very grandiose Overture to the last climactic moment of Losing Time/Grand Finale, this song never falters. Each part has its own merits, and each part has awesome parts. Everyone in the band is on top form.<br /> <br />
B000FVQM2Y|3.0|\\"Brick\\" by Rian Johnson<br /><br />Brendan an edgy high school student received a note from his ex-girlfriend asking for a meeting. The meeting turns out to be a phone call in which she briefly tells of the trouble she has gotten into before expressing fear at an approaching car. After she hangs up Brendan tracks her down and she tells him that she is fine and there aren't any problems. The next day Brendan finds her dead and charges himself with the task of finding her killer......<br /><br />The good: I was pretty hyped about this movie after viewing the trailer. It looked cool and edgy. The film noir concept for this movie was a good idea and I thought the concept of the movie was good.<br /><br />The Bad: I felt like the writer \\"tried\\" too hard when putting the dialogue for this film together. There was too much of an attempt to make the characters appear cool and edgy through their slang which often made it hard to understand what the hell they were saying. I found myself on several occasions rewinding and re-listening so I could understand what they were talking about. I felt like they were speaking in white ebonics or something of that nature. The characters all felt waaay too mature to be high school kids. Their reactions to situations and there motivations made them feel more like they were 20ish or 30ish instead of like the teenagers they were portraying. This gave the movie an odd feel. I think this was done because teens like to think they come across as mature as the characters in this movie do (Target audience is teens). The characters should have been made older or the story and plot should have been dumbed down some. I also found myself wondering where all the adults were. A movie about high school kids that was devoid for the most part of any adult characters (Parents, Police, Etc.)<br /><br />Overall: The movie wasn't terrible but wasn't great either. It was a great idea with just so so execution. Worth renting and checking out but don't by it first.y it first. <br />
B000HBK3MM|4.0|I found this album to be quite enjoyable. The tunes are easy listening. I highly recommend this cd.
B000AADYRQ|5.0|Even though this isn't any more caliber material than Transatlantism to be the next Nevermind, this is pleasing to the ear.  I mentioned in my review of the previous effort, Transatlanticism, that is was nothing to change music in the likes of Sgnt. Peppers or The Wall.  Neither does Plans.  In fact, Plans more or less picks up where Transatlantism left off.  Both albums are discs to put in and, though they are not necisarrily recognizable at first listen, eventually attract your attention the way your third grade teacher would do when you were caught daydreaming.  \\"Soul Meets Body\\" is one of those songs that you can't help but tap your foot to.  The lyrics are a nod to poetic song writing that most of us thought left with the disbanding of Simon and Garfunkel.  \\"I Will Follow You Into The Dark\\" is about the eternal unity of hearts.  While Trans. (tired of spelling that out) was as I refered to as a \\"relationship catalogue\\" mostly dealing with the art of seeking and finding, Plan is what happens after this art has been mastered.  \\"Dark\\" spells that out more clearly than ABC.  It's neither happy nor sad, neither bittersweet nor, well, whatever the opposite of that is.  It just brings a sense of closeness.  Other songs, such as \\"Marching Bands of Manhatten\\", \\"Someday you will be loved\\", and \\"Crooked Teeth\\" constitute that whatever issues and problems resided behind the scene of Trans. have now been resolved and figured out in Plans.  Maturity rules!   <br /> <br />So, artsy review-style writing aside, liked Trans?  Get it, there's no reason not to like it.  Hated Trans?  Don't go near it with a ten-foot pole.
B000085RTZ|4.0|The title of this album pretty much sums it up. This is an engaging, exhilerating album full of progressive, melodic and power metal. <br /> <br />This is a hard album to place in any genre, but i would describe it as Melodic Metal, with strong elements of Power Metal. Fans of Power Metal, eg. Dio, will surely love this, and fans of more alternative Metal will find something to enjoy too. <br /> <br />Songs like Center Of The Universe, Descent Of The Arkangel and A Feast For The Vain are epic and powerful songs with strong, driving guitar and good vocals, wheras Farewell and On The Coldest Winter Night are ballads, with sorrowful vocals and meandering music. <br /> <br />This is a fun, exciting album that is a great listen.
B00002SSKI|5.0|Four childhood friends come together when one of them is having a baby. They had all promised to get together whenever one of them was in need. Even though, the years have passed, and they've gone about their ways with their careers and lives, they come together and reminisce about the childhood days, and growing up. A very touching, nice movie about childhood, growing up and everlasting friendships. <br /> <br />Excellent movie for teen-age girls. The movie is good for a sleepover party or just a girls pizza night. In kind with \\"The Sand Lot\\" but for girls. <br />
B000002JQ6|5.0|I CANT STOP STRESSING HOW GOOD THIS LIVE ALBUM IS,AS IT IS ACTUALLY A GREATEST HITS COLLECTION WHICH IS BEING PLAYED LIVE.THIS IS THE BEST LIVE ALBUM FROM THIS GREAT HARD ROCK BAND WITH BRIAN JOHNSON WITH ANGUS YOUNG PLAYING AT HIS BEST.THIS ONE SHOULD NOT BE MISSED AT ALL.VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
B000G75AE8|5.0|With Lombardo back, you can just tell the difference. This is Slayer of old. Fast, heavy, just freakin awesome. I thought \\"God Hates Us All\\" was a welcome return to \\"Real\\" slayer, but how wrong I was, This is \\"Real\\" Slayer. <br />If you don't have this yet, go get it , NOW. <br />To the guy who gave this 1 star, you need to never call yourself a metal fan, EVER, cos you know NOTHING
0930289234|5.0|This legendary graphic novel has mystery, genuinely complex characters, amazing ideas, superb artwork, and a terrific ending.  I started it knowing almost nothing of adult comics, but still having high expectations because the one thing I did know was that this book was considered a landmark.  Even with demanding expectations, nothing about it disappoints.<br /><br />It tells the story of a group of aging 'costumed adventurers'.  Not true superheroes, since they have no special powers, but people who put on costumes and fight crime.  This is actually a rather odd way to behave, and the text examines the strangeness from multiple angles, with excerpts from the memoirs of one 'mask' and psychiatric reports on another.<br /><br />Into this setting comes one person, Dr Manhattan, who really does have incredible, almost godlike powers after surviving a physics experiment gone bad.  Dr Manhattan is exploited by the US to win in Vietnam and generally dominate the world, but it's an unstable superiority because his powers have left him alienated from and uninvolved with human life.<br /><br />Following riots, the government has outlawed costumed vigilantes, except for those it controls, Dr Manhattan and an unscrupulous adventurer called the Comedian.  When the Comedian is murdered, one clearly unstable vigilante who has ignored the ban, Rohrshach, becomes convinced there is a plot afoot to kill off all masks.  Meanwhile, the government is finding out it doesn't really control Dr Manhattan.  When he decides to disappear to Mars, Russia's aggressive response to the sudden US weakness may bring on WW III.<br /><br />As all this happens, we watch developments from many perspectives - not only the main characters, but a newsstand owner in New York, his customers, and a long-retired superhero how living in a California rest home, surrounded by mementoes of her thrilling past - and haunted by a secret she hopes to keep from her daughter, another masked vigilante.<br /><br />Alongwith an impressive and unconventional climax, the authors treat us to some very amusing bonus scenes after the grand finale.
014240165X|5.0|This is the best of the Alex Rider books, in my opinion, and that means that it's very good indeed. The series is always excellent, but I think that in this book, Anthony Horowitz gets the series off to an explosive start. Once you've read this you will definitely want to read the rest of the series, as you will be so attached to the character and his adventures. <br /> <br />The action starts with one of the few glimpses you will get into Alex Rider's normal life, before everything goes wrong for him and he is plunged into the murky world of the Secret Services. But from the first page onwards, nothing is normal about what happens to Alex. The pace just keeps increasing, and the tension mounts until a brilliant and unexpected climax. I will say nothing more about the plot because you will want to discover its surprises for yourself. <br /> <br />I would definitely recommend that you read this, and I would also say that you should read the other Alex Rider books too. Start with 'Stormbreaker' so that you know the background to the events in the future books. <br /> <br />If you enjoy this one, and the other Alex Rider books of course, then you should also read the Cherub series by Robert Muchamore and the Jimmy Coates series by Joe Craig. They are both also excellent. <br /> <br />
B000G75AE8|1.0|yes, very brutal, slayer has earned the new monicker  nu-slayer that seems to be all the rage these days . This new one is  even a step below the last one. weak from beginning to end. Luckily we still have the new Sodom  and Destruction albums to fill our thrash needs
0425152251|1.0|I regard the author as simple minded, almost primitive in his thought processes. He rehashes old points of view with a sense of his own moral superiority. Disgraceful.
B000002LAC|3.0|I enjoyed the harmony of the singers and a few of the songs, but to really enjoy the CD, you need to be an OLD folk songs  enthusiast. <br />BJF
B000002UYZ|5.0|I love the Beatles and really enjoyed this album, already have the later one.  I was hoping for a few other songs on it like happy birthday to ya, but anything Beatles is great.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|I went to the Virgin Megastore with the intention of buying Californication but decided on Stadium Arcadium. Why? Because it was a dollar cheaper of course. But that's besides the point. <br /> Although I am a new Pepper fan, I'd have to say they're now my favorite band of all time. <br /> When i finally got home, I popped the Cd in, and Sat in my chair for about 2 hours. Bored out of my friggin mind let me tell you. When you first here it you will think every song sounds the same. And you will be pissed off, trust me.The only songs I liked were Torture me and Stadium Arcadium. <br /> I was pissed and tended to other business for a little while, but then decided to give it a second chance. And this album just blew me away. <br /> The Secret To enjoying this album, is not to expect it to sound like a previous Chili Peppers album. I guarantee if you were expecting another BSSM you will be dissapointed, as there is only one song(Charlie)that I think would of fit in that album(teriffic track by the way).But keep an open mind, try to find the beauty in every song and you will enjoy this soon to be legendary album.
B00003CXPJ|4.0|I can't figure out which makes me laugh more:  the actual movie, or the review written by Roger Ebert where he climbs up on a soap box and attempts to lecture the worlds on the dangers of terrorism before handing out a one star rating.  I would think it's quite an honor for a film to be panned by the man who once trashed A Clockwork Orange, #46 on AFI's list of 100 great American films.<br /><br />Honestly, this isn't the type of movie that will blow you away the first time you see it.  There are some funny parts, but you may be distracted with wondering why Stiller chose his wife to play the token hot woman.  But, like any classic comedy, this is the type of movie that just ages well.  It's not a masterpiece that will spark discussions like The Royal Tenenbaums.  It's probably not even the type of movie that you'd want to lie around and watch on a rainy day.  But it's a perfect background movie.  You know, the type of movie that comes on TV and you end up watching when you're just killing time.  Or the type of movie you can throw in for background noise when you have a few friends over.<br /><br />The actual plot is as off-the-wall as they come.  An investigative reporter is looking into the life of male-models and eventually discovers a plot to brainwash Derek Zoolander and make him into an assassin, all for the good of the fashion industry.  One of the funniest things about the movie is that the successful male models are played by Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson--who aren't exactly pretty boys.<br /><br />The comedy in the movie can be pretty hit or miss, but you never get the feeling that the guys are mailing in their performances; this one doesn't suffer from a lack of effort.  There are plenty of word gags reminiscent of Leslie Nielsen flicks.  The movie has several appearances from well known actors like Jon Voight, Will Ferrell and David Duchovny, but what really carries it is the strength of the leading men:  Wilson and Stiller.  In the end, it's hard not to be at least mildly entertained.  Any one who likes the stars should enjoy the movie.
B00005QZWI|4.0|It's true that there are some scores that repeat themselves, but the music is beautiful. My favorite tracks are: Concerning Hobbits, Lothlorien, The Council of Elrond, and Many Meetings. I think the music captures the fantasy feel of The Lord of the Rings. I love it! Great to listen to when you want to make something creative.
B000G75AE8|5.0|This album freakin' rocks! I'm a huge Slayer fan and am yet to be dissapointed. And the guy who gave this a 1 star needs to STFU and get the f**k off my internet.
B000002UYZ|5.0|I grew up with these compilations,my sister practically wore them out!! Later shortly after Lennon was murdered...I became a fan when I got Magical Mystery Tour and a cheap vee-jay knock off of 1962-1963 stuff(\\"Love Me Do\\",\\"Please,Please Me\\",ect;)..for Christmas 1980.....well I was always familiar with the Beatles hits ...but not familiar as much with stuff \\"that didn't make the red/blue album\\".....so I listened to and bought alot of the Capitol stuff such as Beatles 65,Rubber Soul,Yesterday and Today ,ect;.....Long story short....I became a fan....................The Red Album as well as The Blue Album feature songs that were #1's on the charts,standout songs from albums,and singles (which alot went to #1)....Why I compare it to  an 'all-star team' is because it has it's snubs...........\\"If I Fell\\" \\"I'll Be Back\\" \\"I Should Have Known Better\\" are definately 'snubs'....\\"What You're Doing\\" from Beatles VI/Beatles for Sale was a 'snub'......No George Harrison songs made the Red Album...\\"If I Needed Someone\\" and \\"I Want To Tell You\\" could be 'snubs'..........I'm not counting 'cover songs' such as \\"Twist and Shout\\" ...I agree that they don't belong on THIS album .....My point is.. they all can't make it....No matter how worthy ...Great compilation to start with.
0375831002|5.0|I was more than halfway through this book before I realized it was designated for young readers.  Not that it shouldn't be in the same sense that \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" or \\"Diary of Ann Frank\\" are now considered youth literature.  The beautifully sensitive handling of German life during WWII and the horrors of that time make it something more deserving of a wider general audience than just that limited age group.
6305127697|5.0|The archbishop of Chicago has just been brutally murdered and 19-year old altar boy Aaron (Edward Norton) is found  running from the scene, covered in the man's blood.  It looks like an open and shut case against the simple, stuttering boy, until dashing Martin Vail (Richard Gere) offers to defend him.  With the help of a psychologist (Frances McDormand), Vail discovers a shocking secret about young Aaron that may save his life.<br /><br />This is a great movie; I've seen it many times and it never gets old.  Gere is perfectly cast as the handsome and confident charmer, and Edward Norton surely had one of his best roles ever as Aaron - and this was his first movie role.  He is so charismatic that you will not be able to take your eyes off him.  The search for the killer's motive is intense and surprising, with lots of opportunities for Gere to showcase his tremendous appeal.  Highly recommended for those who like character-driven mysteries.
B00004XMV6|4.0|I love this movie for the blindfold scene in front of the fridge, it is a classic scene very erotic, but for me the movie is a bit slow but nothing that KIM BASINGER can't change, watch her striptease. The soundtrack is awesome. HIGHLY RECOMMEND.
B000G73UEU|4.0|Just came home from seeing the movie. A little too long and some performances were painful (anthony for one) to watch. I agree with those who wish different performers had done the songs... tho I have always been a McGarrigle sisters fan. <br />Strangely, Hallelujah is not on this cd, tho in the movie and one of the most moving performances I thought.. Wonder why it was omitted??? <br />Stiil over all, it is Leanard Cohen music and that is always special. I liked his closing number with U2 and I think he did too.... <br />The only drawback to the cd is that the film gives a context to nearly all songs and they flow out of a narrative. That won't be evident on the cd.
B000G75AE8|5.0|Ok. For Those who think Slayer isn't back to sounding like they used to. Then go pull out your copy of God Hates Us All and bring this cd to a pawn shop so diehard fans like me can actually enjoy the cd. For Those who think this cd rocks, then glad to hear it cause yes I did download it cause right now don't have the money to buy it but I am hearing the cd this very moment and its intense. This is Thrash metal that screams headbanging fun. Now crank this motherf**ker and get ready to headbang yourself to a neckache. All Hail Slayer: The Kings of Thrash Metal
B00005JKJA|4.0|Erotic, Dark ,and Confusing the only way David Lynch Knows how. THe movie is beautiful to look at and it does hynotize. Don't mind the multiple viewings to come to my own conclusions. There are clues provided inside the DVD Sleeve..Creepy.
B00005MP58|3.0|I have the Pride and Prejudice collection on Tape. The VHS tapes have a beautiful bold color. When I played the supposed enhanced visual special edition DVD I must admit I was very dissapointed because the color was washed out! I had to put my tapes back in.  <br />The film in an of itself is amazing and it is a shame to see it so unspectacularly displayed in a special edition dvd.
044024157X|3.0|I skipped through most of the book.  The book, to me, seemed to drag on too many unnecessary details.  I was bored with most of it and just want to get to the plot and the ending.
B00005YU1O|5.0|This beautifully illustrated life-as-a-dream piece , if you let it, will jostle you, force you to confront ideas about human constraints of time, space and mortality and leave you feeling like the powerful captain of your destiny you were meant to be.  It's a film whose message, if you choose to receive it, you'll want to share with your world.   <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000G75AE8|5.0|Now THIS is Slayer!  Fast, hard, take-no-prisoners, balls-to-the-f'in-wall hardcore thrash! <br /> <br />And no nu-metal in sight, and by this I mainly mean the production - the sound of this album, production-wise, is closer to \\"Seasons in the Abyss\\" than they've been in years. The nu-metal stylings of the last two albums always made them hard for me to listen to, and the songs sounded much better live (when they'd play them Slayer-style). And don't sweat the 38-minute length - for an album this intense, you don't need fifty minutes.  (Hell, the new Decapitated is 32 minutes, and every minute kills me!) <br /> <br />There is some repetition of past glories - the beginning of the first track, \\"Flesh Storm,\\" sounds a lot like \\"War Ensemble,\\" but I forgot about it the second time around.  There are other parts that sound familiar, but hell, I'll take the familiar over failed experiments any day. <br /> <br />This is a great return to form - let's hope the classic line-up stays together to make many more like this (and more DVDs, please!).
0142000663|5.0|Highly recommended. Steinbeck's prose is used to superb effect in detailing the upheaval of the Joads and their search for a better life in California.<br /><br />To anyone that dismisses it owing to the fact that they read it in high school - re-read it. There is so much going on that a high schooler probably could neither grasp nor appreciate.<br /><br />As well as focusing on the Joads, Steinbeck also take time out in various chapters to provide a social commentary of the times in which the book is set. Farmers taking loans on their lands, the depression/dustbowl, banks/landowners questing for profits, car dealers and suchlike taking every advantage of others misfortune, destruction of crops to maintain profit margins rather than feeding the starving.<br /><br />Through this nightmare world the Joads and countless others have to find their way: death, family fracture and shattered dreams become commonplace. The ending is simply superb.
B000301YY8|5.0|Very pleased with this, has some great tracks. Recommended if you like James Blunt
B00005JOYM|1.0|I find the fact that this movie has been made to be disgusting. This movie should be FREE OF CHARGE if it is made at all. Personally, I think it's too soon to make a MOVIE about all those who died. What's worse is that someone is making MILLIONS off the deaths of thousands of Americans. They're not donating it to charities or the families of the victims. NO! They're pocketing it and buying their mansions and super cars. It's SICK, using our nation's tragedy to further themselves.
B000AMJG4Y|2.0|This movie was rather disappointing.  In fact I found myself enjoying the begining where they replayed major scenes from the game more than much of the film.  The plot was very predictable and the dialogue and voice acting were very bad; scratch that, incredibly bad.  The one thing that is worthwhile is the animation.  The animation was indeed very impressive, but the other elements were so unbearable that the film was still hard to finish.  With this installment of Final Fantasy you get a visual feast and excrement for plot.  If you only care about visuals then this movie is great; if you care about plot, dialogue, character development, acting (voice acting in this case), or any of the other elements that it takes to make a great film you might want to skip this release.
0143036556|4.0|I read Collapse by Jared Diamond. This is an awesome must read book.<br /><br />It talks about why empires or cultures collapse. The author is an anthropologist/historian/scientist who obviously spent years researching the topic. He approaches the subject scientifically.<br /><br />It is a bit of a tough read (long and not well organized for speed reading) but it is the best book I have read in a while. I will not spill the punchline except to say that societies tend to collapse fairly quickly and that we need to care for our environment

0142001104|3.0|I finished a book last night - The Art of Possibility. Great title but not as inspiring as I had hoped. It did have one quote that I liked. A great maestro, Herbert von Karajan jumped into a taxi and shouted to the driver \\"Hurry, hurry\\". \\"Very good sir \\" where to?\\" said the driver. \\"It does not matter\\" said von Karajan. \\"I am needed everywhere\\".<br /><br />Like all books.  They may not be for me.  Read it and get the gems for you.  This one just did not resonate much with me.
B00009V7OR|5.0|THIS IS A WONDERFUL MOVIE TO WATCH FOR EITHER THE SPECIAL EFFECTS OR THE SUPER DOLBY DIGITAL SOUND, OR  THE ADDITIONAL COMMENTARY SOUND TRACK, THIS IS A MUST HAVE MOVIE TO HAVE FOR EITHER A FAMILY NIGHT MOVIE OR JUST FOR FUN.......BUY IT AND ENJOY IT...........
B000G75AE8|5.0|I enjoyed 2001's \\"God Hates Us All\\", and the sound portrayed on \\"Christ Illusion\\" feels like it is a balanced mix of the new and old Slayer.  The songs feature Araya more in a growl mode rather than screaming every word.  The guitars feel more like they came off of an older Slayer disc.  Granted, none of the songs move as fast as those on \\"Reign in Blood\\", but I would say that this album is in fact quite a bit heavier than \\"Reign in Blood\\". <br /> <br />\\"Christ Illusion\\" is very solid throughout.  Every song is catchy, very likeable, unique, and the writing is better than \\"GHUA\\".  (If that's not saying much to some people, I'll say that the writing here is top-notch).  Lyrics subjects include religion (Jihad, Cult, Skeleton Christ), war (Flesh Storm, Catalyst, Jihad, Eyes of the Insane), and the government (Consfearacy).  The important thing is that when listening, it is very easy to say that you are listening to Slayer, the one band that refuses to sound like anyone but themselves.  The album features zero dull moments and clocks in at roughly 38 minutes. <br /> <br />Overall,  I like \\"Christ Illusion\\" because it blends the good parts of many Slayer albums: fast riffs heard in \\"Reign in Blood\\", the slower, refined parts from \\"South of Heaven\\", the catchy guitar sections from \\"Seasons in the Abyss\\" (thinkng about Blood Red and Expendable Youth here), and Araya does engage in some of his screaming heard on \\"GHUA\\".  Slayer has produced a new, unique, very enjoyable album.  Look for Lamb of God's \\"Sacrament\\" August 22nd as well! <br /> <br /> <br />
B0002DB0FO|5.0|\\"Everwood\\" is one of the best family shows, if not the best, I have ever seen.  This series is a must have in a generation full of shows that offer no substance or values.  This show promises to leave you thinking, make you laugh at clever, well-written banter, and always make you feel the warmth of the love between family and friends.  The cast of this show is also an absolutely incredible group with amazing chemistry.
B00008DDXC|4.0|Chamber of Secrets is of course the adaptation of the second book in the successful Harry Potter series, and finds the gang at Hogwarts racing to uncover a great evil that has been released upon the students again. In terms of translating the book to film, 'Chamber' is much more successful than the original, if only because the story is more focused and there is a stronger, hands-on climax that gives Harry something to do. In comparison to the third and fourth films, Chamber of Secrets was also the last movie where major chunks of the original story were not cut out or re-written. There are bits missing, but they aren't as obvious. It also started the trend of the series taking on a darker tone, so parents might want to watch this one with younger kids.<br /><br />Warner Bros did a decent job with the dvd edition. The film presentation is solid. The extras are a mix of kids games and useful production information. Not a huge ton of stuff, but worth checking out. In all, Chamber of Secrets is a successful continuation of the movie franchise. The stakes are greater than the first, and none of the magic world of Harry Potter has been lost. Recommended.
0060574216|4.0|I found this book to be not only full of truths but empowering. Once you understand certain behaviors it makes it so much easier to deal with them. Now women don't have to take these things personally.   <br /> <br />HOWEVER--The one issue I did have with this book is that it may give a little too many excuses to men. Not all their behaviors can be explained by their being different. Some of the examples of 'acceptable' male behavior I thought were clearly caused by laziness or lack of caring. They were a little too extreme on each end. If you take what you read here for what its worth you will find lots of really helpful information mixed in with a few things that go over the top. <br /> <br />Other books I found to be very insightful in matters of women and men are Nancy Madore's \\"Enchanted\\" and \\"Our Bodies Ourselves\\"
B00005JMAH|5.0|In the third installment of the Harry Potter saga, a dangerous murderer has escaped from Azkaban Prison, and Hogwarts has been put on full alert. Harry discovers startling revelations about the man's connection to himself and his parents, and sets out to learn the truth.<br /><br />This installment seems to be viewed as the weakest of the series, and I can't understand why. A large part of it may be that the film omitted several plot points from the novel, stuff fans were hoping to see. At this point, I'm trusting Rowling (who has creative control) knows what will and will not matter in the long run, and that the cuts are unfortunate but justifiable. A good adaptation is not one that is three hours long and squeezes in every detail, but one that stays true to the spirit of the source material. I think Alfonso Cuaron did a great job with that.<br /><br />I also like that he gave the film a distinct visual edge, something the first two films lacked. This was the first film where the trio of child actors looked noticibly older, and the film's darker look fit that. The only part of the film I didn't like was all the talking at the end, where characters start spewing story points and motivations when everything is revealed. It works in novel form, but so much condensed talking doesn't work for the movie screen. Maybe there was a better way to convey that.<br /><br />WB switched packaging styles with this release. Maybe they should've kept everything the same, but whatever. Film presentation is solid, and the extras are again a mix of interviews and production footage with mini-games. I'm starting to really wish these films had commentary tracks. In all though, another fine installment in the Harry Potter franchise.
B00005JOQS|4.0|...lots of similarities to the first Superman movie (like the Lois/Superman flying scene, the airplane rescue, the whole Lex-Luthor land-grab-mastemind...among other things) . The plot has something more, but a lot of it after I'd seen it on the big screen and compared it to the first one, I'd say it was more like a remake (which I quoted and agreed from another reviewer in msn). Guess I couldn't agree more about the emotional theme for the story. Maybe I was expecting a little bit more different and exciting than all the other movies('course for being a \\"brand new\\" Superman movie). But I still give kudos to the awesome fx that's why it's still good for being a \\"new\\" movie.
B000056NX5|3.0|Firstly let me say I was having sound troubles with my player, so had to listen to the whole thing on soft. From what I could hear, the vocals and music were great - plenty of quality voices - but who knows what I've missed from if I'd been able to play it louder! <br />The production on the other hand - euw. Started off very effectively during the opening credits, and I was very impressed with the modern imagery and had high hopes for the rest. Unfortunately it was downhill from there. <br /> <br />The staging was claustrophobic - running in and out of the same set got really tired after a while. Come on guys, even stage productions manage more variety than that! Crowd scenes weren't, well, crowded, which totally destroyed their impact.  <br />The stylised imagery was cool in parts, but for the most part so fake that it destroyed any sense of the reality of the story, the tongue in cheek humour of the lyrics, and any sympathy with the characters involved.  <br /> <br />But my main gripe with the whole thing was the horrific overacting. I don't know how to describe it, but I found it truly painful. By the end I was fast forwarding. JC was turned into a totally unlikeable wet sock who just kept giving everyone hurt angry looks interspersed with a few inexplicable smiles. Judas was pretty good, but once again, just too much acting - people aren't constantly making faces at eachother in real life! It just doesn't feel real when someone is expressing 5 different heartfelt emotions within the same 10 seconds - it looked ridiculous. Mary Magdalene played more subtly, and Herod's part required some overacting, so no complaints there. Pilate - what a waste of a great voice and soulful face - WHAT was with that acting!  <br />I guess I should keep in mind that I'm comparing this production to 2 very recent stage productions I've seen that were fantastic, not to the old movie. <br /> <br />Well, maybe this is why people say there is a difference between acting for stage and TV - if these guys were stage actors, maybe on stage over acting is necessary to be noticed at all - whereas on TV (especially with all the closeups) it's horribly magnified. Just relax guys - you don't need to have a different face for every single word of a song.
0156027321|1.0|As an English teacher and avid reader, I do NOT understand the fascination with this novel. I found it long-winded and poorly written. Stories are told time and again and I am impressed only when it is done well. Hemingway did it better and with much more skill.
0307276902|2.0|Only after my recent read of this book did I learn of the controversy surrounding it.  I was profoundly moved by the book and equally profoundly disturbed and saddened by the author's dishonesty/embroidery of the facts.  <br />Why?  The author is talented.  My enjoyment in Shantaram, another, albeit \\"novelized,\\" memoir was not diminished by the suggestion, which I deem reasonable, that it was dramatized.       <br />People's reactions to the revelation re Mr. Frey seemed to fall into two broad categories, i.e., 1) he boldly and extensively lied, which is wrong in a memoir; and 2) \\"what do you expect, most of these things are exaggerated in the interest of telling a good story.\\" <br />While I can see both points, I realized my problem was that, by misrepresenting,  Mr. Frey directly contradicted and devalued the core message of his book, i.e., the secret to sobriety (and perhaps to a good life) is facing the truth squarely and honestly, whatever and how difficult that truth might be; behaving consistently with that truth; and taking responsibility for it and for one's own behavior.   <br />     Thus, for me, a book with this premise, especially one concerning (and arguably purporting to provide insight into) the torturous and fragile process of recovery from addiction, should itself be basically honest.
B000G75AE8|4.0|As far as their sound and playing goes, Slayer finally got back to where they should be. They got rid of most of the downtuned sludge that seems to be the norm these days. The last bonafide classic Slayer song was probably War Ensemble. I don't know if this record contains a track of that magnitude but it is a much more consistently good listen from beginning to end than Seasons, which had a handful of gems among quite a bit of filler. <br /> <br />Two negatives from their recent lackluster period they have retained in Christ Illusion are hardcore lyrics and Tom's abrasive vocal approach. The lyrics are too blunt, unimaginitive, and profanity-laden. Instead of coming across as dark art, it sounds like some lunatic on the sidewalk shouting. Take, for example, the spoken narrative at the end of Mandatory Suicide. It has much more of an impact on the South of Heaven studio recording because it contrasts so well with the subject matter and riff behind it. Live, Tom now usually screams this narrative and I think that actually diminishes the impact of the passage. It's not as bad on this record as on God Hates Us All, but it is still there. <br /> <br />On the whole, Christ Illusion puts Slayer back in the game after a period of seeming to pander to the Slipknot crowd.  <br /> <br />
B0000AQS0F|5.0|With only 11 episodes originally aired, this show has obtained a cult following like no other.  It spawned a major motion picture (Serenity) due in part to the loyal follow, and the exceptional sales of the series DVDs...

Created by \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\" Joss Whedon, the show features 9 exceptionally well-developed characters, each different than the others but each part of a greater whole.  The stories they tell are witty, intriguing, downright funny and heartwarming all at the same time. <br /> <br />Oh, and there are spaceships, villains, heroes and heroines... <br />This is no ordinary Sci-Fi show... It is an exceptionally well-written, well acted, charter driven show.  You are drawn in by the stories, care about the characters and can't wait to be a part of their next adventure.  Give it a try, and you will not be disappointed. <br />
B000GFLKF8|3.0|The one note about Spike Lee films is that you're never sure what you're going to get. I'm not really a fan, I find that his films are too convoluted with extraneous detail and somewhat over produced. Inside Man retains all the elements of a solid bank robbery/caper film, whilst also giving us Spike Lee's trademark of gritty, street-wise irreverence.     The problem with Inside Man is that it's impossibly unbelievable with a plot that strains the realms of credibility; combine this with it's over-long running time and you have a film that features some great performances by it's cast - Denzel Washington, Clive Owen, Christopher Plummer and Jodie Foster - but ultimately sags a bit in the middle and ends up becoming rather ponderous.      Lee manages to pull off a handful of effective scenes, but he doesn't have the flair to bring the whole movie off with real conviction. An enigmatic master criminal (Owen) - who spends most of the movie wearing a mask - plans and executes a \\"genius plan\\" in which he and several masked companions take over a Lower Manhattan bank and brutally seize several dozen of its customers as hostages.    The NYPD negotiator given the task of dealing with these crooks is an affable junior detective, Detective Keith Frazier (Washington) - under a cloud of suspicion from a previous case - he soon surmises that the perpetrators don't actually want the bank's money. Enter smarmy and elegant New York political insider Madeline White (Foster) who knows everybody and even has the ear of the Mayor.     Madeline is hired by the chairman of the bank's board of directors (Plummer) to oversee the crisis and make sure that certain secrets he has in his safe-deposit box stay secret. The bulk of the film involves the standoff between the bank robbers and the NYPD as they try frantically to ensure that the hostages remain safe.     Of course we know the hostages survive because Lee inserts interview footage of them after the heist is over, this device, however,tips off the outcome, dissipates suspense and quickly becomes tiresome. This is just one of the many techniques Lee uses to clutter the movie's structure and prevent the plot from unfolding as quickly as it should.      Obviously, everyone has something to hide, particularly the bank president, but when his past is revealed, it finally appears with a bit of a thud, with the movie going through to much difficulty to arrive at very little. In all fairness, Inside Man has some interesting things to say about race, money, power and the ethics of urban living, particularly in New York and the performances are wonderfully cynical and gritty.     Washington is sexy and strong, Foster is skillfully odious as the icy, sophisticated and amoral Madeline who cares for nothing but chasing big bucks, Owen is morbidly compelling as the determined heavy and Plummer is letter-perfect as the guilt-ridden bank honcho.     Lee, however, just doesn't seem able to bring all the disparate elements of a heist film into a convincing and gratifying whole and in the end; the movie is vaguely unsatisfying and impossibly far-fetched.

B000GRQKLK|4.0|Over the course of the modern era, whether fairly or not, orthodoxy has come to be associated with glumness and austerity.  Thus, those coming across Orthodoxy by G.K. Chesterton might assume they are in for a dull and obtuse recitation of doctrine and dogma.  They will, however, be delightfully surprised by Chesterton's wit, feistiness, and zest for life. <br />  <br />It is Chesterton's contention that, rather than stifling the individual, it is through orthodoxy that man is liberated to both accept and embrace the contradictions of this life for what they really are in all their wonder and horror.  It is the heretic that is unable to rise to a level that would give him a perspective that would enable him to appreciate things as they actually are since the heretic is ultimately beholden unto these very forces of life.  Chesterton muses, \\"Thoroughly worldly people never understand even the world; they rely altogether on a few cynical maxims which are not true (22).\\" <br />  <br />Often, believers are accused of being close minded.  However, Chesterton contends that Christians are no more close minded than the adherents of any other outlook.  Chesterton writes, \\"For we must remember that the materialist  philosophy...is  certainly  much  more limiting than any religion...The Christian is quite free to believe that there is a considerable amount of settled order and inevitable development in the universe.  But the materialist is not allowed to admit into his spotless machine the slightest speck of spiritualism or miracle (41).\\" <br />  <br />As a result, the heterodox mind must increasingly withdrawal from a world that declares the glory of God in order to maintain the consistency of the fiction it has constructed.  For example, in illustrating views regarding the existence of sin, Chesterton offers the following humorous illustration, \\"If it be true...that a man can feel exquisite happiness in skinning a cat, then the religious philosopher can only draw one of two deductions.  He must either deny the existence of God, as all atheists do; or he must deny the present union between God and man, as all Christians do.  The new theologians seem to think it a highly rationalistic solution to deny the cat (24).\\" <br />  <br />Those adverse to traditional religious notions have constructed elaborate epistemological systems in an attempt to justify their unbelief.  However, Chesterton assures, such intellects (though formidable by human standards in terms of the facts such minds have accumulated) actually bear a startling resemblance to the insane. <br />  <br />Like the insane, rationalists view themselves as the source of all meaning.  In the struggle and strain to understand everything, Chesterton notes, the consistent rationalist is actually driven mad as they end up losing everything but their reason.  Chesterton observes, \\"The man who begins to think without the proper first principles goes mad; he begins to think at the wrong end...But we may ask in conclusion, if this be what drives men mad, what  is  it  that keeps them sane (48)?\\" <br />  <br />The answer provided by Chesterton is none other than the mystical imagination found in religious orthodoxy.  The thing about the cosmos human beings occupy is that is both physically and epistemologically too complex for the finite mind to fully comprehend.  The only thing we can do is appreciate what we can and to accept that there is a power beyond us.  Chesterton notes, \\"The real trouble with this world of ours is not that it is an unreasonable world, nor even that it is a reasonable one.  The commonest kind of trouble is that it is nearly reasonable but not quite (148).\\" <br />  <br />Chesterton further likens the spiritual realm to two wild horses threatening to bolt off into the extremities of either direction with only the church adhering to orthodoxy capable of reining in these powerful tendencies that are good and pure when kept together as a team but result in heartache and ruin if not kept working together in tandem.  Ironically, Chesterton claims, though often depicted as scatterbrained the best poets (actually quite sensible and businesslike) are often the ones embodying the spirit necessary for handling this awesome responsibility.  For what the average person desires above all else is a life of practical romance defined by Chesterton as \\"the combination of something that is strange with something that is secure (16).\\"  And what is any more mysterious and secure at the same time than God Himself? <br />  <br />Written in the early years of the twentieth century, some of the authors mentioned by Chesterton might seem obscure to readers not that familiar with general literary history.  However, the fact that they have been forgotten while Chesterton  is  still  embraced  as  a foremost defender of the faith is a positive testament to the relevance of Chesterton's ruminations that, though written nearly a century ago, ring with a truth that sounds as if they just rolled off the presses. <br /> <br />by Frederick Meekins <br /> <br />

B000E41MS6|1.0|Five over-priced DVDs worthy of five simple words each:   <br /> <br />Stupid.  Inane.  Vapid.  Pabulum.  Juvenile. <br /> <br />While this show clearly has its throng of easily-entertained thralls, someone needs to comment on the sheer price of this boxed-set for any non-fan who may accidentally purchase this juvenile collection of what can only marginally be called sci-fi.  Save your money is my advice. <br /> <br />Whatever whimsical qualities this television show may have once evoked are long gone, and lost in a morass of stilted dialogue, narrow-minded scripts and excessive jokes about flatulence.  To be fair, it remains true to its predecessor by keeping the one thing that kept this show from every being truly popular in the U.S. - cheesy rubber monsters.  This re-imagined series of Doctor Who is populated by obvious rubber monsters.  The first episode features living plastic (rubber) monsters, the second episode is a bevy of rubber monsters.  A veritable cornucopia of them - - a spitting blue one, a giant rubber head and even a flat one made of rubber.  Ridiculous flatulent rubber ones feature in the fourth and fifth episodes.  What is the British fascination with spit and flatulence?  It certainly doesn't make for entertaining sc-fi.  It's remedial. <br /> <br />The remaining episodes each become more and more ludicrous.  For a ship that allegedly can go anywhere in the galaxy, it never does.  Three and a half episodes take place in outer space.  Not even on another planet, but on the exact same space station.  Clearly the BBC is reticent to invest in sets for this abysmal re-imagination.  Visit some alien planets like the other high budget sci-fi shows. <br /> <br />The companion looks like she'd rather be anywhere than acting in this series.  The new Doctor himself seems bipolar most of the time, flinging emotionally from giddiness to disturbed.  And what happened to the outrageous costume?  That new look just didn't work for me.  Doctor Who will always berubber monsters and clown costumes.   <br /> <br />With all the fart jokes and spitting, this DVD Box Set will appeal to the nine-year-olds across the country. <br /> <br />If you are not aware of this show, move along.  There are better DVD's out there worthy of nearly $75.00  AVOID. <br />
B000EYK4KI|5.0|It must have seemed like a great idea at the time for Adam Brody's management, get your client a key part in the new Brad Pitt Angelina Jolie thriller, MR AND MRS SMITH, directed by Doug Liman, for whom Adam had already proved a breakout star for his role playing Seth Cohen on THE O.C.<br /><br />Well, what on earth happened?  As it stands, the movie seems to be thumbing its nose at young Brody, featuring him in the second reel for about 1 minute and a half, when the boss calls him into the office and his officious secretary knocks him down to size by not letting him cross the threshold.  The audience isn't given the chance to know what this is all about, and he's completely forgotten till about an hour later, when he pops up in a car, being transported to a highsecurity federal prison.  Do we ever find out why?  It doesn't matter, we never really care about his character.  When Brad Pitt threatens him with physical pain, and when Angelina Jolie hits him across the face with a telephone, there's not much at stake, for we still don't know who he is or how he got suckered into appearing in the movie.  Was it to give the project some teen credibility, the way John Wayne was forced into hiring Ricky Nelson or Frankie Avalon in minor roles in his later Westerns?  If so, how ludicrous, because all Adam Brody brings to the part is a trademark dorkiness which makes us think that a cheeky smirk is all he has to offer.  He should fire all his advisors who had him take this role.  Yeah, how's that screen career coming, Seth Cohen?<br /><br />Other than this miscalculation, the star power of Pitt and Jolie burns like a city on fire.  They are perfectly matched and no wonder they fell in love or whatever!  She has never been better and her acting, here a series of mumbles, smirks and fleeting realizations, could almost be mistaken for a lost performance by the divine Louise Brooks.  Asked how long they've been together, Pitt says, \\"Five years,\\" and Jolie mutters, \\"Six.\\"  This exchange happens over and over, and it's funnier each time.  (I know it doesn't sound very funny but believe me, in context it is.)  And I know the Hitchcock comedy from 1941 isn't actually the original of this movie, but Liman outdoes Hitchcock at the comedy of manners, heretical as it may be to say.  I'm just putting it out there.<br /><br />My wife wanted to see \\"that movie about Captain John Smith\\" (THE NEW WORLD) and this is what they sent us!

B00005OAE6|5.0|I've always been a huge Bob Seger & the Silver Bullet Band fan since they first put these albums out.  The songs had their meanings then and they have their meanings now--and they still sound great!<br /><br />I can still remember cruising around Ohio back then and listening to \\"Stranger in Town\\" on 8-track tape.  To this day, I still think of a girl named Joyce when I hear \\"Brave Strangers\\" and I haven't seen or heard from her in over twenty-some years.  Listening to \\"The Famous Final Scene\\" as a teen, I anticipated having to live that one someday--and I did.  A couple of times, actually.<br /><br />Although everyone probably associates \\"Old Time Rock & Roll\\" with Tom Cruise dancing around in his underwear in RISKY BUSINESS, I'll remember it as the only modern rock song that every single lounge singer in Las Vegas added to their playlist through the 1980's (and some of those renditions were definitely Bill Murray-ish).<br /><br />I have the CD of this now and it comes in handy whenever I make it back to the Midwest to cruise around in a car.  It takes me back to the beginning when we were \\"young and strong.\\"<br /><br />With Bob Seger's music, it's never a far trip to take.

B00000IFWE|5.0|I was very disappointed to read some of these reviews to find fans expressing distress over the album.  I've grown up on Petty, and associate practically my whole childhood with \\"Wildflowers\\", which I considered to be his best album along with \\"Full Moon Fever\\".  However, as I've gotten older, \\"Echo\\", a dark, distressing album that stems from Petty's divorce, has increasingly become my favorite Petty album.  The lyrics continue to get better, whether deeper and more introspective (\\"Room at the Top\\") or just good old-fashioned storytelling (\\"Swingin'\\").  The music itself is much more despairing than the usual happy-go-lucky Petty gems (think \\"Free Fallin'\\" as opposed to \\"Lonesome Sundown\\"), with dark overtones seeping insidiously into every song, including the ones that aren't even meant to be so.  All of the musicians display vast amounts of improvement and attempt (and generally succeed) to find some new tricks and thus stylistically speaking this album is quite different than the Heartbreakers' usual repertoire, making it very difficult for some die-hard Petty fans to stomach; however, it is in this musical uniqueness and Petty's own personal affliction that brings out the best in the Heartbreakers.<br /><br />\\"Room at the Top\\"s quiet appreciation of solitude, mixed with a lower-neck solo by Mike Campbell, creates a laid-back, low-key atmosphere that generally is consistent throughout the album.  \\"Counting on You\\" is a bluesy rocker that contains sneering vocals and more excellent guitar work.  \\"Free Girl Now\\" is more reminiscent of early classic Petty, letting up on the melancholy mood for a brief jam session.  \\"Lonesome Sundown\\" is a beautiful piano ballad complete with steel guitar handiwork and the first few inklings of a voice Tom Petty rarely uses, a voice that hints at deep emotion and quiet reflection that makes the song (and the album) a much more personal ride for both the bad and the listener.  Following another song about loneliness, \\"Swingin'\\" attempts to lighten up the mood with another mid-tempo rocker, complete with harmonica and piano, but while the music is generally looser and more upbeat, it is a successful failure in said respect; its lyrics, like that of \\"Free Girl Now\\", display a sort of quiet attitude that frequents the album, in which Petty describes a feeling of resistance and liberation that seems to come from his own forced independence that also appears in the later \\"This One's for Me\\".  \\"Echo\\" is a highlight track that is truly depressing.  Its piano, acoustic guitar, and Petty's lower-register vocals provide an atmosphere that I can only assume is an angry, introspective song to Petty's wife that provides some of his most bitter and remorseful lyrics ever:  \\"And I don't want to mean anything to you/and I don't want to tempt you to be true.\\"  The song builds and displays how while Mike Campbell can truly rock out, he also knows how to tone it down a bit in order to create a moving piece.<br /><br />\\"Down But it Won't Last Long\\" is an upbeat song that contains a catchy chorus and a cool keyboard bit, creating a heavy atmosphere to a song describing a \\"Swingin'\\"-esque feeling of hitting rock bottom and yet making a comeback.  The next two tracks are largely forgettable, as Petty's attempt to lighten it up a little bit grates against the feeling of the rest of the album, as I honestly don't believe Petty was feeling all that \\"lightened up\\" at that point in his career.  \\"About to Give Out\\" redeems these two tracks as another straight-out rocker that hints at exhaustion with yet another catchy chorus.  \\"Rhino Skin\\" is a dark take on life and the hardships endured, with a hauntingly beautiful solo at the end which appears to contain three guitars working wonderfully together.  The lyrics are some of the darkest on the album:  \\"If you listen long enough/you can hear my skin grow tough/love is painful to the touch/must be made of stronger stuff.\\"  However, the most brilliant song on the album is the closer, \\"One More Night, One More Day\\", a sad and absolutely beautiful ballad that slowly builds into one of the best solos Mike Campbell has ever created.  The vocals are desperate, emotional, and hurt, and is Tom Petty at his best.  The chorus is one of the most depressing pieces of music ever written, with Petty, raw and exhausted, admitting in a summation of the entire album \\"I keep breaking down, breaking down, you know.\\"  It is a moving track that shows how ironically tragedy can create genius.<br /><br />While the album is generally considered one of his weakest efforts, Petty fans (and critics) should take into account the depth and sheer brilliance of the music and especially the magnitude of Petty's lyrical abilities.  I recently saw the Heartbreakers in concert and was disappointed to find that Petty has seemed to disown this album and, more tragically, fans don't seem to care.

B000GFLKF8|4.0|I must admit that I just expected another heist film with the detective (Denzel Washington) and the nanck robber (Clive Owen) playing mind games. Sure there's mind games but the movie is still not your usual bank robber wish hostages movie. It's smartly made by director Spike Lee and you never really know where it will go. Plus the performances are just top notch. Clive Owen finally gets a film since Closer where he gets to show how good of an actor he really is.<br /><br />  While of course Denzel is awesome as always as the dective trying to figure out what Owen really wants out of the bank robbery. While Jodie Foster gives a different sort of performance that we're used to from her. Christopher Plummer's \\"also really good\\" character owns the bank and hires her to make sure he gets something back that's inside the bank. She knows it must be something either valuable or something he just wants knew one to find out about. So she's really good as women that people go to get things done and she's also always makes it clear that she's nobodys fool.<br /><br />  While William Dafoe (Spiderman) is also in good form as a cop who's ready to take command of the situation if Washington messes up. Chiwetel Ejiofor (Four Brothers, Serenity) plays Washington's partner and the two work together well. Ejiofor has proven this year and last last that he's no doubt ready to be a big star. He shows that here too by sharing the screen with Denzel with ease. With the cast so good it helps that the script is so clever, interesting and unpredictable. This film is really a must see!
B000G75AE8|5.0|Not that they have gone nowhere, but the band basically has the old sound, with some nwer touches, is back. This basically has not stopped from playing in my radio all day since I got this album, this is basically almost a throwback to classic Slayer. King and Hanneman are in form and the chemistry these two have is spectacular, just how they blend and form some great melodies and riffs is just out of this world. Tom Araya's voice sounds revitalized and just has most aggresive growl and more brutal deliverance, and some of the songs here are more brutal, like Jihad which might raise some eyebrows because of how they tell the story of terrorists through what goes on their mind. Dave Lombardo double bass is just as great as when he left off on Seasons in the Abyss. Every song here is a 5 star,even some of the weaker tracks, basically this has to be the album to beat this year and has set the bar high for the other bands to release their material. Well go and get this NOW.

B00005AREQ|5.0|This has been a favourite cd of mine for longer than I care to remember and having read some of the reviews posted here I can't believe no one has mentioned the drumming of Richard Bailey. He really drives these tunes for JB.His playing is a lesson in finesse and skill. Drumming with a mixture of funk and fusion. This cd along with \\"Wired\\" are absolute must haves for serious musicians.

Although the responsibility for my actions are my own, I feel that my decision to follow the advice in this book nearly destroyed my life.  To this day - almost 20 years later - I am still living with the disastrous consequences, for which I was not at all prepared.<br /><br />There is, even to this day, a vacuum when it comes to the understanding and treatment of severe childhood psychological and physical abuse. At the time this book was printed it represented practically the only \\"consumer\\" information on this subject.<br /><br />At the time I read it (shortly after it was printed I believe) I was very young and dealing with extremely serious abuse issues.  Unfortunately, I followed the misguided advice it contained about confronting my abusers - something which I never should have done.  The results were disastrous.  I then made my second mistake in reaction (also following advice in this book) - cutting off all ties with my family.<br /><br />I still believe that I needed to eventually cut off ties with my abusers.  However, the advise in this book gave me the false impression that I could take on more than was safe or advisable.  It minimized and/or omitted the possible consequences.  The confrontation escalated the situation and put me in actual danger; it provided no healing or closure whatsoever.  What it did do was isolate me from family members who weren't ready to confront the issue, and added a huge layer of trauma that I've struggled to overcome ever since.<br /><br />I would like to advise anyone dealing with extreme abuse issues to proceed with caution indeed.  I sincerely hope that my feedback can help other readers avoid making the same mistakes I made.  I would urge you to think twice before following any of the advice in this book.
B00006AFUR|4.0|30 Seconds to Mars are something of an anomaly on several levels.  First of all is the matter of their frontman, one Jared Leto, who accomplishes a nearly impossible feat in that he is both an actor and musician, and exceeds in both fields.  This is not entirely unheard of, since one need not look any further than William Shatner to find proof that this sort of thing is possible (a-cough).  But anyway, the band also stands out (note the use of the word band - this is not simply an outfit for Leto to sell his face to the public) in that on this, their debut album, everything sounds surprisingly well-crafted.  That is not to say that it's a perfect album - it has its flaws, primary among them the fact that the creative songwriting runs out of steam for roughly a third of the album.  Also irritating is the \\"concept\\" behind the record.  Now I've nothing against concept albums, but when a band tries so blatantly to be thought-provoking and cryptic it ends up sounding rather pretentious and ultimately quite silly.  Despite this, at certain points the lyrics actually come close to the lofty intelligence they crave, as on the songs \\"Edge of the Earth,\\" \\"Fallen,\\" and \\"End of the Beginning.\\"  Musically, the majority of this album is pretty average hard rock, though with some spacey technical influences and metal sensibilities thrown in for good measure.  Highlights are \\"Fallen\\" (which features a pretty simple yet memorable drum beginning and a nice atmospheric feel for the verses, and builds to an almost alt. metal-sounding chorus), \\"Oblivion\\" (a rather addictive piece ridden with cliches but still rather well-orchestrated), the radio-friendly \\"Welcome to the Universe,\\" and my personal favorite, \\"Echelon,\\" complete with almost darkly romantic overtones and an epic chorus.  But not all of the album is quite so listenable.  \\"93 Million Miles\\" begins promisingly but is marred by a chorus that lacks any real saving grace, melodic or otherwise.  \\"Year Zero\\" drives its simplistic melody into the ground and then adds insult to injury by piling on the standard-issue spoken-word concept jargon.  And then we have \\"Buddha for Mary,\\" which seems to be a perennial favorite among listeners of this album.  While not terrible, I just can't get into this song for several reasons.  First of all the conceited lyrics and their even more pompous and out of place symbolism are pretty terrible.  When you couple this with the fact that this song is essentially a diluted and very thinly-veiled attempt to write a song akin to Tool's \\"Reflection,\\" you get what I consider the low point of the CD.  The remaining songs are all decent and reasonably memorable, especially the stop-start pattern of \\"The Mission\\" and the chorus of \\"Capricorn (A Brand New Name).\\"  Despite all my criticism, this is a surprisingly solid release.  Though the general tone of this review may seem negative (as it does to me upon looking at it), I can't help but like this CD.  Sure it can be grating at times (mixing formulaic melodies and then trying to sound complex through the use of white noise or high-concept lyrics has never really worked), but it can also be beautiful.  As such, it is worthy of four stars, and a place in every open-minded rock fan's collection.
B0000AUHQT|3.0|It seems something of a shame how maligned the extravagant 1974 movie version of F. Scott Fitzgerald's literary masterwork was when it was originally released. So much media hype surrounded the production, including a Scarlett O'Hara-level search for the right actress to play Daisy Buchanan, that it was bound to disappoint, and it did critically and financially. It's simply not that bad. Interestingly, looking at the film over thirty years later, I am taken by how faithful the movie is to the original book both in text and period atmosphere. The central problem, however, is that Jack Clayton's overly deliberate direction and Francis Ford Coppola's literate screenplay are really too faithful to the book to the point where the spirit of Fitzgerald's story becomes flattened and plot developments are paced too slowly. The result is an evocative but overlong 144-minute epic movie based on a novel that is really quite intimate in scope.<br /><br />The focus of the plot is still the interrupted love story between Jay Gatsby and his object of desire, Daisy. Narrating the events is Nick Carraway, Gatsby's modest Long Island neighbor who becomes his most trusted confidante. Nick is responsible for reuniting the lovers who both have come to different points in their lives five years after their aborted romance. Now a solitary figure in his luxurious mansion, Gatsby is a newly wealthy man who accumulated his fortunes through dubious means. Daisy, on the other hand, has always led a life of privilege and could not let love stand in the way of her comfortable existence. She married Tom Buchanan for that sole purpose. With Gatsby's ambition spurred by his love for Daisy, he rekindles his romance with Daisy, as Tom carries on carelessly with Myrtle Wilson, an auto mechanic's grasping wife. Nick himself gets caught up in the jet set trappings and has a relationship with Jordan Baker, a young golf pro. The characters head for a collision, figuratively and literally, that exposes the hypocrisy of the rich, the falsity of a love undeserving and the transience of individuals on this earth.<br /><br />Casting is crucial, and surprisingly, most of the actors fulfill the characters well. Robert Redford, at the height of his box office appeal, plays Gatsby with the right enigmatic quality. As Daisy, Mia Farrow captures the romanticism and shallowness of a character that ultimately does not deserve the love she receives. Even if she appears overly breathy and pretentious, her frequently trying performance still fits Fitzgerald's image of the character. Bruce Dern makes an appropriately despicable Tom Buchanan, while Karen Black has scant screen time as the trashy Myrtle. A very young Sam Waterson makes the ideal Nick with his genuine manner and touching naivet&eacute;, and Lois Chiles is all throaty posturing as Jordan. As expected, all the exterior touches are luxuriant and feel period-authentic - Theoni V. Aldredge's costumes, John Box's production design, Douglas Slocombe's elegant cinematography, and the pervasive use of 1920's hits, in particular, Irving Berlin's wistful \\"What'll I Do?\\" as the recurring love theme. The film is worth a look if you have not seen it and a second one if you haven't seen it in a while. It's actually better if you've already read the book.

B0002DRDBE|4.0|If you like Kevin Smith, you like Clerks. I realize that every rule has millions of exceptions, but Smiths low budget indie feature from 1994 reveals everything great (and not so great) about this director/writer/actor (if you call Silent Bob acting).<br /><br />Clerks came out during an early 90's time-period when culture was taking a step sideways instead of forward. A generation brought up with 80's hair metal, Eddie Murphy movies and The Cosby Show wanted something different. Instead of moving forward, our culture wanted smarter versions of the established entertainment, music fans embraced Nirvana and Pearl Jam, television watchers tuned into Seinfeld and film embraced new visions from the likes of Quentin Tarantino. Enter Kevin Smith into this time with his no budget masterpiece that probably wouldn't have been seen if it were made five years later.<br /><br />What made Clerks stand out was its revelation that a great script is all you need to make a great movie.  You didn't enjoy Clerks because of its A- list actors, big budget action sequences or filmmaking tricks that director's greatly over hype; you liked Clerks because it was funny and relatable.  Smith's writing captured the everyday feel of his early 20's life as his main characters Dante and Randal's shift at the Quick Stop and RST Video becomes an unexpectedly crazy journey. Dante's struggle with his inability to resolve the issues in his life is what lies at the heart of every great Kevin Smith film. Right up to Clerks II he is a master at writing a realistic interpretation of male insecurity. Dante and Randal both remain believable male characters even while revealing feelings that many males may never actually talk about.  Randal becomes the voice of the audience watching the shenanigans of Dante's life unfold trying to make Dante realize his life is ultimately up to him, while cracking the comments and flipping the bird to his work commitments that both the audience and Dante envy.<br /><br />The 10th Anniversary DVD holds up surprisingly well as the makers realized that most followers of Smith's had seen this film dozens of time (if not more). Instead of simply providing a nicer looking version of the original, the package contains two must haves for collectors. The first is the original version of Clerks that appeared at New York's Independent Feature Film Market, which started the ball rolling on Clerk's eventually being picked up by Miramax. The original version reveals the dark tone that Smith was originally going for an ending that reveals Dante's struggles to be very small in life's grand scheme (if you see it you'll understand).  The other added element is The Snowball Effect, a documentary about the making of Clerks that takes you from Smith's humble beginnings in New Jersey to his the joy of his $27,000 flick being picked up. The documentary is as addictive as the original Clerks as the sheer audacity and long shot reality of Smith's venture, a young man mortgaging his future on a small flick, is an amazing feat to revisit.<br /><br />With the release of Clerks II there might be more of an audience for Smith's original. If you wish to indulge in this deluxe package it is worth it, unless of course you are one of the million of exceptions to the originally stated rule./>The 10th Anniversary DVD holds up surprisingly well as the makers realized that most followers of Smith's had seen this film dozens of time (if not more).

0553801503|2.0|I took this book out of the library, so I did not feel cheated when I really didn't like it.  As many reviwers have said, there are far too many characters we don't care about (Cersei, Brianne), and far too little written about the characters we actually do care about.  Arya is involved in some inexplicable plot... Jaime spends most of the book mired in depression and regret... Sansa - nothing really happens to her.  Filler, filler, filler.   <br /> <br />In addition, this book is even more vulgar and violent than the previous ones.  I get it, you need violence to keep the authenticity of the times, things weren't pretty during the Dark Ages, but do we really have to see the world \\"rape\\" on every second page?  Any woman is constantly either being actively raped or being threatened with rape.  We get the point! Maybe it's just that GRRM is catering to a male audience, but I hope no one is really deriving pleasure from reading about women being continuously raped, beaten and humiliated.   <br /> <br />There were some good passages in the book (hence, I gave it two stars), but as someone below said, the good parts are lost in 700 pages of blah blah blah.  I'm going to give the next book a try, but I'm definitely taking that one out of the library as well!

B000002MUN|5.0|I was listening to Tom Petty's Highway Companion and wasn't really impressed.  I just kept comparing the songs I was hearing to the songs on Wildflowers.  This album is over 12 years old and I still listen to every song on it.  Just a perfect album.
B0000AUHPG|3.0|This \\"claims\\" to be the original uncut version yet there is still at least one missing scene and the way the cuts look there appear to be many more missing.  *SPOILER* The scene where Henry Fonda shoots the young boy is completely cut.  In the original that pitcher the boy was holding exploded after the gunshot.  The movie is still excellent with the greatest opening scene ever in a Western.
B000F3AAUW|1.0|Really...I just don't understand the hype over this album.  Yes, 'Crazy' is a good catchy song.  But the rest of the album is all over the place, and to me, it's unlistenable.   <br />
B00000099Y|5.0|I remember buying this album in the month it came out back in '96, and to this very day, I listen to it regularly.  I played it so regularly, in fact, that I drove a couple of girlfriends to near madness because I would hardly listen to anything else in my car.  For whatever reason-be it that I was just an impressionable kid, or what have you-I think the music imaged onto this little piece of cheap plastic had such a bearing on me that, for better or for worse and in no small part, partially shaped me into the person I am today.  I don't want to talk specifics of this record's music in this review, because if you know and love the music, there's a chance you already understand where I'm coming from.  And also, I just don't want to be redundant.  I'm only 24, but Tool's been a steady part of my diet for just about a decade.  I just want to advise anyone else out there that's 14 or 15 years old, and just starting to get a feel for the music he or she likes, that even if you don't like this album, find an album or artist that moves you-something or someone that really seeps into your bones-and relish it.  Because in ten years, when your whole world has changed, it will be a pleasant indulgence to re-live something you loved when you were young.

B000FS9FCG|3.0|So many good things about the movie, but since my opinion is original only in its understanding of politics, let me be brief and to the point.    1) The message here, both in timing and design, seems clearly to be a stab at U.S. middle east foreign policy...and as misguided as that policy may be, the U.S. regime is neither terrorist nor totalitarian, and ME terrorists the likes of Al Qaeda and Hezbollah cannot claim a legitimate grievance in the manner that V does in this movie.  V is blaming his own government.  Middle East terrorists blame someone else's government, despite the fact that their own governments are the ones mostly responsible for their problems.    2) In a time when the world is consumed by hatred, the answer is peace, not violence.  Infrastructure, not war.      3) To suggest that blowing up a building is an appropriate way to make a political statement is dangerously irressponsible in the aftermath of 9/11, unless, or course, we're talking about Osama Bin Laden's house, or better yet, the imperial palace in Saudi Arabia.  Dictators, who block the economic growth of their countries, expel foreign aid workers, confiscate UN food aid, create a state-run media of hate, and waste precious resources on palaces and weapons, these are the guys we need to be taking a scrutinizing look at. They're the ones who are keeping their countries and citizens 200 years behind the rest of the world languishing in the archaic ideologies and conditions that breed terrorism, violence, and war.    Okay, so I'm not being brief...    THE MIDDLE EAST CONFLICT EXPLAINED    Why V for Vendetta misses the mark:    For the reasonable and the informed, a piece that plays metaphor with the U.S. and Israel and likens them to terrorist nations (such as the kind we are familiar with in Orwellian fiction) does such a disservice to the truth as to make itself into a menace and impediment to intelligent thought.    This is because the U.S. and Israel are more like victims than aggressors, and are therefor more similar to V than to the totalitarian state which is supposed to represent them.    1000 years of genocidal racism gave way to the state of Israel in 1948.  Israel is V.  The cultural reaction throughout the Middle East has been the same as it might have been had a group of Mississippian Blacks suddenly formed their own nation in 1950s America.  White America would've invaded and eliminated the threat.  But let's say for a moment that the U.S. was unable to do this.  This is the situation we find in the Middle East in 1948; a system of entrenched racism and beliefs of cultural superiority are challenged when a small minority repulses the genocidally motivated aggression of a seemingly more powerful majority.  Check your history!  (In the Middle East caste system, Jews had no rights, and were called \\"Dhimmi\\" citizens) Then, the majority, as they might have done to blacks in America, responds with a backlash against Jews throughout the Middle East.  A million Jews are expelled from their homes, their property confiscated...they flee to Israel.  At the same time, roughly the same number of Arab Muslims (700,000) are expelled from the Israeli occupied territories.  Here we come upon the defining moment of the Middle East conflict: Israel absorbs a million Jewish refugees, Egypt, Jordan, and Syria keep the 700,000 Muslim refugees in camps for political reasons (to incite anger against Israel) where they languish until they are finally renamed and reborn: they become Palestinians.  Imagine that the blacks won in our fictional Mississippian Revolution, and expelled the whites.  What if those whites were never allowed to rejoin white society?  What if they were kept in refugee camps for generations?  What emotions would guide their actions?  What would they think of the blacks in Mississippi?  What would they think of the whites who had forsaken them?  How would they view the white regime(s) that were manufacturing/using their plight for political gain?    Here we have seen the real nature of the conflict in the Middle East.  A conflict created by Middle East leaders for political gain, to open a gulf of hatred between the East and the West, which can never be filled by violence, but only by empathy, understanding, modernization, prosperity, and the building of infrastructure.  The impediment to this progress being the governments of the Middle East nations themselves.
B000H0MKOC|4.0|I love satire. I love this film. But like all the arguments about smoking it always shows the same main two #1.smoking is bad and they lie about it causing cancer. #2 Tobacco defends its self and denies. For ME I don't smoke becuase i don't want to die. My argument I'd like to see in a movie is that NO ONE GIVES THE TOBACCO COMPANIES THE RESPECT THEY DESERVE. If you as a company can find ways to make people kill themselves and pay you for it, YOU ARE A GENIUS. I love it, respect it, defend it, and a film that can take a bunch of idiots and their stupid arguments an put funny spins on both of them is held in high regard. This film is a slap to both parties and gives you good laugh
B00005JOML|5.0|This movie starts slow, don't be fooled. Michael Mann has put together a sophisticated, enertgetic, fast paced film. For the first time in years, I felt my heart beating in a movie theatre. You can't trust Mann, his committment to realism means anything is possible, I found myself deeply concerned for characters who were walking perilously close to the seductive and seedy realm of underworld crime. Blue lighting, sunsets, and carribbean nights set the mood as two detectives find themselves undercover, and in over their heads. As the stakes get higher, friends are put to the test...proving themselves to be both admirable, and humanly flawed, Crocket and Tubbs are two loyal soldiers caught up in a storm. Crocket's in over his head when temptation (Romeo and Juliet style) threatens everything. Meanwhile, Jamie Fox turns in an oscar-worthy performance. The supporting roles are masterfully woven into a film which ushers in a new era of closer-than-real story-telling. Get out of here Real World/MTV, Vice puts us right where we want to be: on the edge. (My astonishment is that so many people have been turned off to this film, my tastes are usually pretty mainstream) This is one where you can walk out of the theatre in a heightened state of mind, I hope you enjoy it
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I wanted to see this movie when it first came to the theaters, unfortunately I didn't get a chance to then. So I bought it when it first came out on DVD...and I wasn't disappointed!<br /><br />From the moment you see the chandelier come to life, to the final scene, you are sent on an emotional and visual adventure. I have watched this movie SO many times over the last year and a half, that I've lost count...and I STILL get goosebumps when the chandelier is shown at the auction!<br /><br />Beautiful music, amazing cinematography, lots of symbolism, and a cast of up and coming (not to mention extremely talented and gorgeous) actors that will steal your heart. Gerard Butler plays the most amazing Phantom that I have ever seen, and truly makes the role his own. He exudes raw sex appeal, thus showing how Christine would be apt to fall for the Phantom. He also portrays the complexities of the Phantoms character very well. His voice is just how you might imagine the Phantom's voice...beautifully haunting, gravelly at times, with the ability to touch your soul. Emmy Rossum makes a wonderful Christine...sweet, beautiful, and she sings like an angel.<br /><br />Andrew Lloyd Webber is a musical genious, with incredible vision! Add Director Joel Schumacher to the mix, and you end up with a visually stunning movie! You will fall in love with this movie from the start!<br /><br />I have all three DVD's (Wide Screen, Full Screen, and this Two-Disc Set) for my collection...and this one is THE best! The behind the scenes extras are wonderful, it's cool to see all that went into this movie, and the Easter Egg will have you cracking up.
B00008NRL8|5.0|this ablum was fantastic i bought it for my wife who is from argintina because i heard it had nice tango songs on it. its a wonderful mix of old tango and and electronica. i recomend it for everyone.
B000028U0Y|5.0|This album is classic Johnny Cash and should set the standard against which all country singers and their albums should be measured.  George Jones said it best when he sang \\"who is gonna fill their shoes?\\"
B0009HLDFU|4.0|First off, I would like to say that all you have to do is disable the software that enables anti-rip software the CD automatically when you insert the disc.  Then when you go to Itunes, you import the CD no problem.   <br /> <br />As for the music itself, its a great CD!  I love the split album concept...it seems like the Foos eliminated most of the middle ground between Heavy and soft.  I do however feel that some songs on the discs couls have been replaced with better songs.  I don't like \\"Hell\\" all that much..I mean, Cmon, you cant come up with a  better and different song to put on the CD?  Im not to crazy about the opening track, and Deepest Blues are Black either.  The second disc is great, but too one dimensional as well.  I guess thats what happens when you eliminate anything between very heavy and very soft...You get a one dimensional record. <br /> <br />but despite my complaints, it is a great record and love listening to it!
B0002W18MU|5.0|I have been a fan of Johnny Cash for over 40 years.  I have heard, loved and been moved by many of his songs but never has an album moved me as emotionally as this one has.  In spite of his health, in spite of his losing June, his voice is strong and his message is one that is powerful that we should all listed to.  He has inspired me and has made me look at my own mortality differently.  I thank him for that and he shall live forever in my heart.
B00005MP58|5.0|11 years ago, the BBC (British Broadcasting Company) produced this elaborate version of Jane Austen's classic novel. Though I'm very fond of period pieces, I confess I had a lot of<br /><br />\\"Prejudice\\" (pun intended; if Jane Austen, rolling in her grave, will forgive me) against seeing this production, due to my intense disappointment at their previous stage productions of<br /><br />\\"William Shakespeare's The Tragedie Of Macbeth\\" and the horrible<br /><br />\\"William Shakespeare's The Tragedie Of Antony And Cleopatra.\\" The aforementioned productions starred Jeremy Brett (\\"My Fair Lady\\") as Macbeth; former James Bond (\\"The Living Daylights,\\"<br /><br />\\"Licence To Kill,\\" \\"Disney's The Rocketeer\\" and Franc Roddam's<br /><br />TV remake of \\"Cleopatra\\") and Lynn Redgrave (Vanessa's sister) as, respectively, Antony and Cleopatra. My \\"Prejudice\\" was further augmented by the incredulity of anyone (unless it were Kenneth Branagh) attempting to take on a role made famous by Sir Laurence Olivier in the 1940 film version (please see my reviews on all of their films; quite excellent movies, they are). My apprehensions were quite unneccessary. Colin Firth (\\"Shakespeare In Love,\\" the \\"Bridget Jones\\" movies) made the role his own. Having read the novel several times before viewing the 1940 film, I was quite familiar with the classic story (also having viewed \\"Mansfield Park\\" and \\"Sense & Sensibility\\"; the two of these being equally elegant films; please see my reviews on those wonderful productions). Obviously, the intended audience is mature older teens and adults (those who don't consider the study of classic literature or the prospect of a 3 hour movie<br /><br />\\"F---ing boring\\"). I now have only to see the version made last year starring the lovely Keira Knightley as Elizabeth Bennet, Donald Sutherland as Mr. Bennet and Academy Award winner Dame Judi Dench (\\"Shakespeare In Love\\") as Lady Catherine De Bourgh. I highly recommend all three film versions of the classic love story for all high school English classes, beginning with the 1940 film, followed by this masterpiece and concluding with the 2005 film version. Not Rated.nglish classes, beginning with the 1940 film, followed by this masterpiece and concluding with the 2005 film version. Not Rated.
B000286S8S|4.0|well, some may perceive this newer best of compilation as a vehicle to serve up those highly anticipated new van halen tracks. that's exactly whats been done here. as a longtime, die-hard fan of this group its tough to watch the decline of the band and their music. so there's two best of compilations released within a nine year period to push a few new tunes on the fans. it's about time , up for breakfast,and learning to see are pretty good tracks and up for breakfast is my favorite of the three new ones. the other tracks of course i've heard over,and over,and over... whether your a fan of Roth or Hagar or both,there's enough here to satisfy your ears. the reason i gave this release 4 stars is because of the inclusion of live tracks from right here right now live cd, \\"panama,aint talkin' bout love,and \\"jump\\" and the exclusion of songs like \\"5150, \\"summer nights\\", and mean street which are all radio staples and would have been choice replacements for those live tracks. what were they thinking? the live tracks were unnecessary fillers. the original studio versions are already on the discs, so why the hell bother with the live versions?  it just doesn't make sense.
0553801503|5.0|A previous review touched on all my points regarding how the mid-point of epics work, so I won't belabor them. Quite simply, this is the best fantasy epic ever written, better than Tolkien,  <br />better than anything of it's kind. Sure, I missed Jon, Tyrion and all the others but this is the story of a whole world, yeh? <br />I loved this book and look forward to a joyous reunion with our older friends as well as more time with our new ones. <br />   There's not a character who doesn't live and breathe in every chapter. I still remember being astounded when Mr. Martin made me <br />(MADE ME!!)come to love the \\"Kingslayer\\" as much as Jon Snow. <br />   That alone, is pure magic. I predict that when the whole thing is finished, this book will take it's rightful place as just one more piece of a truly seminal work.  <br />   If you want to see an example of how to ruin something grand, read King's last Dark Tower book.  <br />   But this, brothers and sisters, ain't that. Have some patience kids, and don't watch so much T.V. It's messed some of you up when it comes to understanding literature.
0679879269|5.0|I found Pullman's \\"The Amber Spyglass\\" completely entertaining and in many points quite provocative. This trilogy is well worth the read and several re-reads to boot.
B000GFLKF8|4.0|Everything about INSIDE MAN makes the viewer want to love this film: Spike Lee as director, a stunning cast, a good musical score that sounds a bit like Bollywood music, a theme that invites social comment.<br /><br />For this viewer the terrific ingredients do not add up to a unique suspense thriller of a film. The story is a variation of hundreds of other films (writer Russell Gewirtz somehow got away with just an outline of a script of holes) and the technique of telling the story - interspersing post incident interviews with the people involved in the caper - makes it thud along.<br /><br />Denzel Washington is his usual fine acting self, playing a cop with his own demons. Chiwetel Ejiofor is solid as his partner. Clive Owen spends the better part of the film behind a mask but continues his reputation for quiet and powerful characterizations as the bank robber. Christopher Plummer is convincing as the back president with secrets to hide, which Jodie Foster as a middle-woman manages to manipulate. Willem Defoe is fine as the cop in charge. They all perform well in roles they could do in their sleep.<br /><br />Clocking in at over two hours the film seems to dawdle over some inconsequential details in an attempt to camouflage the holes in the script. Spike Lee makes it work because of his style. But in the end the story isn't involving enough to hold our attention ('been there, done that') and this viewer, for one, fell asleep during portions when the film slowed for unknown reasons. Love the director and the actors, pass on the film. Grady Harp, August 06
B000GFLKF8|5.0|This is one of the best suspense movies of the year.  The plot is so clever that you never guess where it is going until the end.  The acting is superb, by a fantastic cast, and the director did an outstanding job of bringing these bing names together.  More surprisingly, it is also at times viciously funny, with some very typical \\"New York\\" situations. <br /> <br />Highly recommended for those seeking more than your average action thriller.
B000G75AE8|5.0|great CD, killer vocals, in your face attitude, and not afraid to \\"go there\\".  This is a CD that truly captures the anger that lies inside all of us.  Definitely not a CD for the weak of heart.
B0002YCVXI|5.0|We bought this CD to introduce our 8 year old son to great Cello music - he has been learning to play Cello for the last 2 years.      We brought this CD with us on a recent road trip to Colorado and South Dakota, and played it almost exclusively during our trip.  What a wonderful audio complement to the visual beauty that we experienced.    Thanks Yo-Yo!
0151008116|5.0|it was so hard to put this book down. Pi's story is so unbeleivably amazing.  it will make you picture fantasticle scences in your mind as you read and really make you think about people's physical limits, not to mention the fact that i actually learned a few things about survival and wild animals. if you get this book i guarentee you'll like, if not love, it.
B000BTC5LW|4.0|After waiting 12 long years I finally got it, no thanks to Amazon.  I had signed up long ago to be notified of its release only to find it by surprise in Sam's Club.  Anyway, the video quality is no better than on my VHS copy, in fact I think it was better on VHS but I'll have to watch that one again to be sure.  The sound was a bit thin and at times it didn't even sound like dolby 5.1  However, the extras on the DVD were great, especially \\"Bootlegging the Bootleggers\\".  At least I now have it on everlasting DVD not just gradually deteriorating tape.
B00005YJMX|5.0|absolutely the best dvd and the music is wonderful - so glad to have this dvd, previously had vcr copies which were very much inferior
B000000OYQ|2.0|I love Led Zeppelin zeppelin, And i love jimmy page, so when i saw this album, I clicked buy in a second. <br /> <br />But i can't lie to you and say buy this album, because It really is bad, and very repetitive,  <br /> <br />Try John paul jones's solo effort zooma, or Robert plant's mighty rearanger for quality. <br /> <br />Jimmy has a new album coming soon, Let's hope he puts out some quality music, Like the page we know and love.
B000002B30|5.0|the item was new and in perfect condition, although it arrived a week past its estim ated time
B0001I55OC|1.0|I was unfortunate enough to have stumbled across this in 2004.  I was thinking it would be a good sit down and watch type of movie, but it was really lackluster.<br /><br />The acting is wooden, the script is very lame, and worst of all, the action isn't very exciting.  I expected a much better movie from director Richard Donner.  There is a battle scene, and there are action scenes, but they just aren't exciting.  When the action isn't exciting, you better have a good story.  The story here is alright, but certainly not enough to save the movie.<br /><br />I don't hate any of the actors, they are decent when they have something to work with.  Here they had nothing to work with, so they obviously didn't do too well this time.<br /><br />This really isn't worth your time.  I gave this to the thrift shop after I got it, and I feel sorry for the person who bought it there.
B00003CWL6|5.0|This is my undisputed favorite movie of all time.  I ordered it as a gift for someone who has never seen it.  Lester Burnham releases the real man who has been supressed by his marriage and family for way too long.  He is my personal hero.  Even though it ends tragic for him, it ends happy for him.  Awesome.
B0000E6XH3|5.0|The first time I ever heard of Daft Punk was when I saw the first \\"music video\\" (\\"One More Time\\") on Cartoon Network. I was already a fan of the works of Leiji Matsumoto, so I recognized his hand in it right away. I just recently purchased Interstella 5555, and let me tell you, it tells a story in one of the oldest of ways, by telling it purely with music combined with imagery. The music of Daft Punk is light and fun, and will leave you feeling good after each and every chappter of 5555, whether the chapter was happy or sad. <br /> <br />Whether your a fan of anime, music, or both - I am the latter - you will enjoy this story about an alien pop group known as the Crescendolls. Its a fun watch, and a worthwhile addition to any artistic animation afficienado's collection. <br /> <br />When the credits started to roll with a remix of my favorite song from the disc, \\"Aerodynamic\\", I sat on my couch and laughed, \\"That might be the coolest damn thing I have ever seen.\\"
0451196716|3.0|This was a really great story that pulled me in and had me cheering the characters but the ending totally sucked. King obviously didn't know how to end it. The book could have also been cut by close to a hundred pages and still have the same effect.
630471193X|5.0|I ordered the movie for a school project and they arrived in perfect condition with just enough time for me to do a movie psychology review on it. I got an A, so it was worth it!
B000G75AE8|3.0|For any standards of metal this is a good album. For Slayers standards, it sucks. Tom's vocals sometimes sound like there's no emotion. The guitars are tight as usual. As far as drums are concerned, Lombardo is still back in 1986 which is a good thing. I just can't get into the vocals. Example, \\"Eyes of the Insane\\" Tom tries to sound sick and well, insane. But it just isn't convincing. Sometimes you can tell he's just yelling things without actually \\"feeling\\" them. Maybe if he wrote more of the lyrics...good metal album, ok Slayer album. I doubt they'll ever top God Hates Us All.
B000GFLKF8|2.0|Show me a movie where Denzel Washington is bad? He always puts forth a powerhouse showing in any role, and Inside Man is no different. <br /> <br />If is just that the movie as a whole felt really long, which comes as a suprise to me, considering I sat and watched the Lord of the Rings (all three) without ever looking at my watch. And all those movies are about walking around outside, while Inside Man is well walking around in a bank.  <br /> <br />I as a movie-goer find myself looking back at the already produced movies to find that a majority of those today, lack any plot. Which I can say is the story here. I could stick this movie in the same stack of Jurassic Park 3. Kid gets lost, parents go to island to find kid, everyone leaves. Thats essentially what I am seeing here... <br /> <br />Maybe it is one of those movies you have to rewatch to appreciate, but if I look at my watch another time during this flick it's to the bargin bin with this one.
0553212478|4.0|Like many teenagers, I was under the impression that Frankenstein (thinking it was the name of the monster) was a remorseless brute that got joy from torturing people. But after reading Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, my perception completely changed.<br /><br />I literally knew nothing about the story save that Frankenstein--again thinking that it was the monster--was repulsive in aspect.<br /><br />As I read the story I came to find out that Frankenstein was actually the name of the man who created the abominable creature. Also, I would have never guessed that the creature would have been made malicious by human disdain. The \\"daemon\\" was at heart benevolent and innocuous, but human scorn turned his ways and he sought revenge.<br /><br />Altogether, the story was very well written. It did have a few flaws, such as the overuse of the word \\"endeavour\\" and the impractibility of a man remembering such long a story and actually narrarating the whole of it, not forgetting to omit a single quote. Despite the few flaws, Frankenstein is indeed a horror classic (although, I failed to find any horror in it) and should be read by the fans of the genre.
B0000A98ZP|5.0|I love John Hughes and I love the brat pack, and I have to say this movie is WAY better than all of the others.  And it's not just those who graduated in the 80s who haven't seen this movie who're locked in a cave, but ANYONE who has not seen Club is culturally deprived and should seek help imediately.

B0002EQ7E2|5.0|Having just purchased Simon's excellent new release SURPRISE, I felt compelled to compare his new work with his past works.  To me the ruler to which one measures a Paul Simon album is the 1986 album, GRACELAND.<br /><br />Paul Simon has long been a questing artist, who does not just release album after album of the same formula, but releases albums that are different in concept and theme each time out.  He has always reached outside of the folk-rock blueprint of the classic su=inger-songwriter for new ingredients to enliven his music, going all the way back to the Simon and Garfunkel years.  Through the years he has tapped Latin, Brazilian, Jazz and Gospel as a base to construct his personal version of pop music.  On GRACELAND he took a quantum leap by incorporating Southern and Western African styles to his literate lyrics.  GRACELAND is one of those times where magic occurs, and all the risks pay off by creating a timeless classic.  Of all the classic albums by Paul Simon, GRACELAND remains his highest achievement.<br /><br />From the opening BOY IN THE BUBBLE through to the closing ALL AROUND THE WORLD (featuring Los Lobos), Simon creates a consistently ambitious level of music that is both accessible and experimental at the same time.  Simon scored two hit singles from this album (BOY IN THE BUBBLE and YOU CAN CALL ME AL), which were  unlike anything else on the charts in 1986. Those songs, along with DIAMONDS ON THE SOLES OF HER SHOES and the title track are true highlights in the Paul Simon songbook. This is an album without any weak link, uniform quality from start to finish.<br /><br />This was an album that introduced many people for the first time to the rich textures of African music.  At the time GRACELAND was an extremely controversial due to the fact that Simon recorded with South African musicians against a UN sanction, misguidedly aimed at the Apartheid based South African government.  By making this music, Simon ironically may have helped bring the evils of apartheid further into public view and hasten its demise.  Musical purists (always a fun-loving bunch) cried that this was a diluting of \\"true\\" African music and was nothing more than pure exploitation.  Luckily, these are now moot points in discussing this album.<br /><br />Some 20 years after the fact, this album continues to give the same enjoyment that I got when I first unwrapped it and played it. While SUPRISE is not up to topping GRACELAND, I'm glad that Simon is still recording challenging and enjoyable music. GRACELAND is truly a classic album that offers excellent musicianship, sublime songwriting and a great introduction into the gifts of World Music. I doubt if I'll change my tune if you check back with me in another 20 years.ing the evils of apartheid further into public view and hasten its demise.

0757302661|5.0|I poured myself into this program. I absolutely loved it. I started the book when I was 4 months pregnant. Because I was planning a homebirth, I wanted to be prepared. I found a teacher, did the class, practiced all the exercises with my husband, and listened to rainbow relaxation every night for the last 3 months of pregnancy. I truly believed that I would have a pain-free birth. Labor started on my due date, gently at first. I loved knowing what to do, how to breathe, what to visualize from the very beginning. I feel like labor was a little out of my control, and hypnobirthing teaches you the tools to move easily into an out of control situation, allowing it to take you where it needs to (birth!) while you are just focusing on the moment at hand; breathing and relaxing. My birth was at home and it was pretty textbook; 22 hours and 3 1/2 hours of pushing due to my daughters hand on her face. I had also practiced bikram yoga during my pregnancy, so had high hopes that between the yoga and hypnobirthing labor would have gone faster, but it didn't. I did feel pain. A LOT of it. As soon as I entered into active labor I was uncomfortable. The only visualization that worked was riding a wave and my cervix opening like a rose. I spent a lot of time in the tub with my husband. I did not ask to go to the hospital because the pain was too much. I spent the whole labor focused on my breathing techniques, but not in the altered, hypnotic state I had so easily slipped into while listening to rainbow relaxation before. I pushed my daughter out in one push. I had been pushing for so long that I wanted it over. She was healthy, bright and beautiful! I felt really let down after the birth, frustrated I had spent so much time following the book and tapes so completely. I didn't know what I had done wrong. That said, when I get pregnant again, I will do the program. And, although my birth was not pain-free, I used all the tools in this book. Looking back on my experience, hypnobirthing was a beacon of light in the dark unknown of labor.ng was a beacon of light in the dark unknown of labor.
B000EQ47HC|5.0|This cd is awesome....Tom really did a great job with both of his cd's. Go out and buy this cd. It rocks and sounds so much better then the first time out..
B000G75AE8|4.0|By now you've probably read a broad spectrum of reviews ranging from one-star to five-stars.  The one-star ratings tend to be from folks who are looking for 'Reign in Blood II'.  The five stars tend to be from folks who tend to like anything Slayer does. <br /> <br />I have been a Slayer fan since 'South of Heaven' and have every album.  Some are better than others, but Slayer ALWAYS BRINGS IT with every album.  Basically, all I have to say is that if you are a Slayer fan, this album is worth picking up.  I personally think it's their best since 'Seasons in the Abyss' (I didn't think they were going to top 'God Hates Us All', but they did).  The lyrics are some of their most intense in a few albums (except maybe 'Disciple' from GHUA).  You might listen to it and feel otherwise, but I think it's almost guaranteed that a true Slayer fan will like this album (even if it you feel it's not their best).  If you like Slayer just buy the darn thing and enjoy it.  Crank it up, don't overanalyze it, and make up your own mind. <br />BTW - Regardless of how one feels about this album, it is definitely NOT NU-METAL.  I think that is an accusation leveled by haters just to discredit a band or their work.  The label does not apply here in any way, shape, or form.
B00005JP5J|5.0|I just saw a sneak peak of this movie &  I LOVED it!  The cast is wonderful...each character is brilliantly cast & the acting is first rate.  Their characters are so believable...in one scene where husband & wife  are arguing, you  can see the ghosts of past arguments in Toni Collettes eyes...so much depth.    The cinematography is great...there's a real \\"feel\\" to this movie...broad shots of blue skies and endless roads highlighted by this broken down yellow VW van that just keeps going & going.  The costumes are great too. Very subtle, but meaningful affects, right down to little Olive's wedgie in the bathing suit competition.  I know  I should tell you what the movie is about, but that would take the fun out of it. You should go &  experience the ride like the  rest of the family. The ending \\"talent\\" part of the little miss sunshine contest is hilarious, and the actress  that played Olive should win an award for her fine performance. This is a comedy, but definately not suited to young teens because of the subject matter & language. I will warn you, this is a quirky movieand the humor is a bit dark, but I think you will definately enjoy this movie.
B000G75AE8|5.0|Wow, I was blown away from the first note to the last. God hates us all was awesome but this is taking Slayer to a new level!
B000BB14YY|5.0|I am not going to write about the merits of Ran, i.e., it is a given that it is perhaps Kurosawa's finest work. If you bought the previous Masterworks edition and are sitting on the fence whether to purchase the Criterion, don't hesitate. The \\"Masterworks\\" transfer is a travesty compared to the Criterion. The colors just bleed in the Masterworks, whereas here the colors are perfect and vibrant. On the Masterworks DVD there is a restoration demo, which I thought was a joke since they did a lousy job compared to the Criterion. Get this DVD if you are a Kurosawa fan; you won't regret it. This is perhaps the finest Criterion DVD that I have purcased, and I own over 40 Criterions.
B00005JOMN|5.0|I found \\"Miami Vice\\" rather sophisticated and refined like all Michael Mann's films. I guess many viewers boo it because they expected something explosive like \\"Bad Boys 2\\" or something alike. Well, that's not the way Mann works. \\"Manhunter\\" was not as intense and mindblowing as Brett Ratner's \\"Red Dragon\\" maybe and \\"Heat\\" was not your average cop movie with all the necessary ingredients like shoot-outs, car-persuits and so on. They were in the feature, but \\"Heat\\" was not all about that. The same thing here - \\"MV\\" is based primarily on psychological tension and not on usual genre's attributes. It doesn't matter how many cars will be crashed and how many explosions we will see. It's more about simple undercover agents doing their routine work. It's about what it's like to live a double life, to be among people normally you wouldn't want to be around, to participate in things that can turn you into a much worse person, and it's about an inner core which helps a man not to become one of those he's hunting down.<br /><br />And from this point of view \\"MV\\" is definately not an entertainment. Don't try to see it as an action-movie. It's rather a thorough insight into a masculine psyche as \\"Heat\\" was. And Michael Mann is making his research concentrating mainly on tiny details. If you watch closely you'll notice many of them and they'll colour this film for you. Yes, I know, it was mentioned before but that barely visible tear trace on Li Gong's cheek was just ingenious. Speaking of Li Gong, I must say I was truly dazed by her performance and I already see her glorious future in Hollywood.<br /><br />Another thing that can't escape your attention is how beautifully the whole feature is shot. Without any CG Michael Mann manages to wait till the right moment for his shot and that really pays off. Those views of waterfalls, background sheet lightnings, ocean at night and distant rain from the cloud the airplane is approaching just deserve an academy award for cinematography.<br /><br />Yes, the shoot-out in the end of the film is brilliant. Maybe still not as brilliant as \\"Heat's\\" one but still. Try watch it in a theater because the sound effects will blow your mind - looks and sounds like bullets can literally blow your brains out.<br /><br />The one thing I disliked in the film was the relationship between Farrell's and Foxx's characters. It was not fully elaborated, looks like during the whole movie they were existing apart from each other. They were doing the same work, talked a lot of course, but I couldn't catch that chemistry between them.

Maybe still not as brilliant as \\"Heat's\\" one but still. Try watch it in a theater because the sound effects will blow your mind - looks and sounds like bullets can literally blow your brains out.  <br />The one thing I disliked in the film was the relationship between Farrell's and Foxx's characters. It was not fully elaborated, looks like during the whole movie they were existing apart from each other. They were doing the same work, talked a lot of course, but I couldn't catch that chemistry between them.

B000AC5B16|4.0|Dutoit was Decca's house conductor of French music for almost two decades, and here is gathered at budget price all the significant orchestral works as well as the two piano concertos. The spledid sonics and Dutoit's reputation will probably be enough to attract listeners who want everything from one conductor, but to my ears none of these performances rises to the very highest level.<br /><br />With Boulez, Munch, and Monteux looking over his shoulder, Dutoit's readings come off as colorful, restless, bright, often brash, and lacking in that final touch of elegant style. Outside the French tradition we also have great Ravel recordings form Karajan, Reiner, Bernstein, and (in the two operas) Maazel. I'm not so sure it's such a good idea to put all one's egs in Dutoit's basket.<br /><br />Since Amazon doesn't give track listings, here's the lineup.<br /><br />Daphnis et Chlo&eacute;<br /><br />Pavane pour une infante d&eacute;funte<br /><br />La Valse<br /><br />Piano Concerto in G major<br /><br />Le Tombeau de Couperin<br /><br />Valses nobles et sentimentales<br /><br />Menuet antique<br /><br />Piano Concerto in D major (for the left hand)<br /><br />Fanfare from 'L'Eventail de Jeanne'<br /><br />Bol&eacute;ro<br /><br />Alborada del gracioso (Miroirs No. 4)<br /><br />Ma M&egrave;re l'Oye<br /><br />Une barque sur l'oc&eacute;an<br /><br />Rapsodie Espagnole<br /><br />L'Enfant et les sortil&egrave;ges<br /><br />Sh&eacute;h&eacute;razade<br /><br />Sh&eacute;h&eacute;razade - Ouverture de f&eacute;erie
0380789035|3.0|The rating is for the yarn spinning skill of the author, not the substance of the book.Shadow, the protagonist, is about as unflappable a character as may be conceiuved. The ill-defined thesis that American technology has somehow created a new race of gods inimical to the ancient pantheons of the human races is absurd, and the idea that the( immortal gods (the very essence of divinity)  can be destroyed by the lack of mortal worship or the enmity of new techie gods is nonsense and patently disrespectful to the gods and their role in the civilization of mankind. Gaiman is a competent wordsmith with a knack for suspense, but there is no substance here.

B00005MP58|5.0|This production excels the shorter version in every category from the excellent cast to the lovely location shots.  Every character is well developed and each actor performs but does not overdo it.  This is one of the reasons that British productions are so good.  There is no throw away parts in this. <br />The pace is very good, the diction is good, and the music is a delight.  For those who cannot watch something of a long duration, split it up, and you will not miss anything
B000E41MS6|5.0|I can't explain it, but this is the first time i've seen a re\\"generation\\" of a classic British Sci-Fi series and they've done it even better!  I saw all thirteen episodes of the new Doctor Who series and I was like, \\"WOW!\\"  It has better plots, more action, and what I really appreciate more emotion.  Billie Piper as Rose is probably one of the best companions i've seen in a long time.  She is not only concerned about others, but she stands up to Chris Eccleston's persona.  I'm really disappointed that there is no recollection of Gallfrey though except that The Timelords were killed in the Time War.  This is probably the best version of the series yet.  I hope they keep this show going until someone becomes tired.  The special effects are incredible for the millenium as well.  You will have some tears coming out of your eyes towards the end of series though.  Buy this if you are a true Doctor Who fan!
0451191153|5.0|\\"The Fountainhead\\" is a great rarity; a well-written and successful philosophical novel.  Though Ayn Rand becomes occasionally too didactic, I realize that she was concerned that some readers would be unable to see the points she was making.  I did find this novel humorous at points, as Rand placed Howard Roarke, her protagonist, in contrast to his environment so that Roarke appeared to be in control of his environment.  Those who understand this novel will find humor in many places.  I am unsure of how much of the humor was intentional and how much was unintentional.<br /><br />There are several principal characters in this 700+ page book.  Howard Roarke is an architect.  Roarke believes in himself and is a creator.  Rand uses Roarke as her example of the \\"perfect\\" man.  Rand contrasts Roarke primarily with Peter Keaton.  Keaton is an adapter of technology.  He \\"borrows\\" his architectural concepts from historic styles rather than focusing on the practical and having form follow function.  Keaton panders to popular styles.  Roarke designs plans that are functional and fit within their environment.  The beauty of Roarke's designs is in their functionality and how each design fits its environment.  Unfortunately, repetitive design is valued, and creativity is not.<br /><br />There are several other significant characters in this book.  Ellsworth Toohey is a newspaper columnist.  Toohey exemplifies mediocrity.  Toohey is manipulative and power hungry, but is so subtle in his machinations that few people recognize Toohey for what he is.  I was fascinated that Toohey seemed to want a worthy opponent and lamented that his opponents were unable to see what Toohey was doing.  Toohey's comments and actions imply that Toohey seeks socialism or communism, but he wants to be the absolute dictator.  Toohey seems to have all the worst characteristics of communism and fascism.<br /><br />Gail Wynand is the owner of a chain of newspapers.  Wynand is a self made man.  Wynand is quite similar to Roarke in many ways, though it takes us a long time to discover the similarities.  Both men eventually come to admire each other.<br /><br />Dominique Francon is very important to the novel.  She appears cold-hearted, though she is not.  She becomes a connection between Keating, Wynand and Roarke.  However, Dominique realizes that she will likely destroy nearly everyone she contacts.  Rand uses Dominique as a tool for continuity throughout the novel and to aid in contrasting the characteristics of the three men in Dominique's life.<br /><br />What is \\"The Fountainhead\\" about?  It is about one man pursuing his quest for what he believes to be right, regardless of what most of the world thinks.  Rand hypothesizes that if that man is correct, and has an objective ideal as his goal, that eventually the rest of the world will recognize the validity of that man's (or woman's) viewpoint and follow along.  \\"The Fountainhead\\" is against the average, against mediocrity, against collectivism, against rule by committee, and against the manipulation of people by those whose only purpose is to seek power over other men.  \\"The Fountainhead\\" is for individualism, for creativity, for following your own path and for objective truth.<br /><br />Ayn Rand tried to keep her explanations relatively simple.  She characterized people as those who lived through others and those who lived for themselves.  However, I think there could be a third category, which Rand likely classified as the second category.  As we know, not every person is highly creative.  But, an average person may well recognize the creativity of a person such as Roarke, and admiring such creativity, does what they can to bring that creativity to realization.  I would call this third category a person who facilitates the creator.<br /><br />The first time I read \\"The Fountainhead,\\" I considered the book profound.  I looked at the world, and myself, in a different perspective.  This book is easy to read, but itis not light reading.  The book requires a lot of thought, and you may find that you disagree with Rand or you may be disappointed.  If you are a potential Howard Roarke, it is unlikely that you will read this book at all.  For the rest of us, \\"The Fountainhead\\" is a great work of fiction that embodies what many of us like to believe is the basis of the United States.  While there may be a little cowboy in us, there is a lot of pioneer spirit, which was founded on a strong sense of individualism.  We can only hope that these ideals remain with us in the future.<br /><br />I hope you find this book as incredible as I did.  Enjoy!read, but it is not light reading.

B00004T8RK|3.0|This is without a doubt one of the most depressing albums of all time. I also seem to notice that there's no direction to this album either. I have to wonder if this was the group's way of protesting against thier label, or if they wanted to keep up with the new alternative bands as far as using the machines to keep modern, and if there was just nothing new to write about as the songs were weak, and so are Vedder's vocals. I have to ask the group's mental state at the time they recorded this; were they depressed, were they angry? Did they even care thinking that nothing was going to change for the better? This sounds like someone doing this like it's a chore, and not what they want to do. If this is true I want them to know I was depressed in 2000 also. I know I had the best thing happening to me as I was engaged, but at the same time I felt like I was dying because I was struggling spiritually, I was working more hours, and at a place where they make work a chore, and not a pleasure. I'm still there, but am working to get out. I wouldn't have played this six years ago, but I felt like I had to because it's hounded me all this time, and now I want to set this free as it's been a hard last 8 years, and now it's time to free the depression the hurt, and the shame. This wasn't too bad, but it's below par for PJ.
B000002UUX|5.0|This was the first album from the longest, most productive line up of Megadeth to date. Dave Mustaine, Dave Elfson, Nick Mensa, and Marty Friedman.  Here the deuling guitars begins... Marty and Dave trade off solos beautifully in songs like Holy Wars and Tornado of Souls.  The speed is blistering, and the precision is excellent.  This was the beginning of the platinum sales of megadeth, and for a good reason.  They kept doing what they do best, play metal. They do stray from the path in a few albums with cryptic writings and risk, but those can be overshadowed by this album.   <br /> <br />Highlights: Holy Wars, Lucretia, Tornado of Souls, Rust in Peace/Polarus, Hanger 18.    <br /> <br />I have seen megadeth 3 times, and everytime I do, these songs just blast through all others.  This is a must have for any thrash metal fan/metal fan.  A good place to start a Megadeth Collection.
B000000H57|5.0|I've always loved this alblum, and I guess my friends did too because it always comes up missing. This is my third copy I've had to buy. It's nice and dark and not too fast. It's a tie between this one and Bloody Kisses for my favorite Type-O album.
B000A7Q2DM|5.0|Great CD!!!  I thought it being from Jared Leto, and actor, that this would not be good.  I was wrong.  The song's are all different, there is a lot of talent and creativity put into not only the music, but the lyrics as well. The mood changes throughout the music, and it's great that there isn't screaming in the songs.  Great melodies, and Leto's voice is extrememly smooth with the changes.  <br /> <br />Great purchase, only thing is that the songs are coded and you can't copy them easily.  You only get 3 tried to upload a program and transfer the files.  I've tried it twice already, and had no luck with the transfer.  After 3 tries, you have to buy another CD if you want to try another transfer.  Wish I could put this on my computer or PDA, but I need to get some help before I try it again.  May have to see if I can download songs off the internet instead.
015670160X|5.0|i read the book after watching the film (4 times) and found it just as wonderful as the film.  orlando is a character that never grows tiresome and although she is very old, everything seems to be new and fresh in her eyes. also, the reflections on how gender roles affect us and how we are seen were fascinating. i love the way the book is written as well-with woolf commenting as the biographer-because it adds to the  plot and helps to organize orlando's crazy life and her many emotions.   i think many people do not give this book a fair chance since the subject matter is a bit different than the norm (a 400-year-old who is born a boy and then turns into a girl) but i challenge anyone to read this book and not find at least one thing they can relate to.
B000E6UK5K|5.0|Just for the record, I also happen to have almost everything Pink Floyd made since The Piper at the Gates of Dawn and I'd say this is Gilmour at his best. I quote also some lyrics for the critical critics \\"Hopeless to reminisce Through the dark hours We'll only sacrifice What time will allow us\\" (maybe forget Dark Side) and if you missed a point then \\"Life is much more than money buys\\". No pretense and anyway even if you think this is not the best Floyd there is, cheer up because 99% of all recordings ever printed should never have been printed. As for the CD design, organic design means environmentally friendly judging from the evidence - that and with David Crosby and Graham Nash on the title song this CD speaks at 150 decibels. <br />
B000069HJI|4.0|\\"Breakfast In America\\" is without a doubt one of the all-time classic albums.  Beyond that and \\"Crime Of The Century\\", it's easy to let the rest of Supertramp's work go unnoticed.  That's what happened with me.  I've been listening to Crime and Breakfast for years while neglecting the rest of their catalog.  My bad!  I've recently picked up several other Supertramp albums, including \\"Famous Last Words\\". <br /> <br />Clearly, Supertramp were trying to distinguish FLW as something other than simply a follow-up to the blockbuster Breakfast.  Although the sound is unmistakably Supertramp, it's obvious there was an effort to strike out in different directions to accomplish something that could build upon their previous success. <br /> <br />Check out \\"Waiting So Long\\" for some foreshadowing of the following Supertramp album, \\"Brother Where You Bound\\" with it's rich orchestration and trademark build-ups and the '50s doo-wop influenced \\"My Kind of Lady\\" for an indication of these changes.  Of course, there is still the classic Supertramp with songs like \\"It's Raining Again\\" and \\"Crazy\\" (which could easily have ended up on Breakfast In America based on its sound). <br /> <br />Despite hiding in the shadow of Breakfast In America, Famous Last Words is still a great album in the Supertramp tradition.  Consider it essential for the Supertramp fan.

B000G75AE8|5.0|I am 45 years old.  I have seen and heard it all.  I saw Van Halen open for Black Sabbath in 1978.  I saw Rush on their 2112 tour.  I saw Kiss before they became a kiddie band.  I saw AC/DC with Bon Scott. And I recently saw Slayer on the Unholy Alliance tour.  No one can touch them. They are the heaviest band to ever live.  No other band has been this consistently heavy, for this long, ever.  Not even Motorhead.  I say they are the greatest heavy metal band of ALL TIME, and I doubt if any other band will ever topple their throne. <br />All Hail Slayer!!!! <br />
0736063684|5.0|This book is as good as I decided to send each of my family a pair, One for men and one for women. I have made my traing plan by refrance to this book pages, in case I forgot how. In other words this book is my daily traning book.  <br />Strength traning for men could be much better if it had divided tranings to two part of \\"Mass making\\" and \\"deffnition building\\" of muscells. <br />No one has time to make all tranings, regardless of Mass or deffniation making. If there was a prioritaize list by trainngs effectivitet, it could make it much easier for bigginers (those whom has not time to do all trainngs) to chose which traning is the most important, and do that in their short time. <br />I have used Muscle and fitness DVD's divition of Mass and Diffination. I want to build Mass. Therefore I found Mass tranings first in Muscle and Fitness DVD, then found them in Strength traning for men and made my traning plan by reffrances to this book. <br />My traning plan is good. It work and I can see my muscles grow bigger. <br />Seyed M A Mearaji
6305078491|3.0|This is my technical review of this version. I HATE IT.<br /><br />Ok, first of all it's visually superior to other versions I've seen, which have been \\"over exposed\\". The audio seems compressed somehow. It's necessary to turn the volume WAY UP to hear it! Another reviewer was dead-on with the subtitles. When they DO use them... they're awful!! Other versions I've seen, use a small, Arial-type font, with NO background. MUCH easier to read. Then there are the opening credits. THESE ARE NOT AUTHENTIC. Again, in other versions, the opening credits are in German, and not produced with computer graphics!! Then there are the scenes in which the actor is reading from a book. The cut-aways on this version to a \\"bright\\" screen with that awful computer written text are ridiculous and distracting. Those are the issues I have with this version. I cannot say where you might find a more original copy... my guess would be from \\"Sinister Cinema\\". A version I rented some 20 years ago was a public domain release, from some no-name company, which again did not display the contrast that you'll enjoy on this version, but at least had some authenticity to it, and doesn't appear it was doctored by a geek with a mouse!
B000EULJLU|4.0|This isn't a head banging album. <br />This isn't a typical tool album. <br /> <br />However this album has some of the most tantilizing, enticing, sounds I've ever heard on any CD in my collection.  <br /> <br />Obviously songs #1, #2, #5, #8 are the stand out songs, but it doesn't end there. If you listen to this album when you first wake up in the morning you'll find the soothing, refreshness, that is needed to start your down out right is in songs #3 and #4. Song #7 does come off like a Queensryche knock-off, however it sets up #8 perfectly and without it you'd lose the feeling of hearing a play.  <br /> <br />The only song that is worthless to me is the \\"Indian Chanting\\" of song #6. Justin, Adam??? Do you have an explanation here? Can I assume it is because of where area 51 is located? Isn't it on an ancient Indian Burial Ground of sorts? No? Well, I think this portion of the album could have been left to liner notes as opposed to song lyrics.  <br /> <br />I find myself humming the rythm of song #8 all the time, even when I'm listening to another song, on a different album, by some other artist. That rythm is pure poetic. I can sing it to my baby as a lullaby and he loves it. <br /> <br />I think this is one of Tools finest creations. It isn't hard core and I'm glad for that. This is an album I can listen to everyday at my office. It's soothing and meaningful.
B0000TB050|5.0|I am a huge U2 fan and this is the BEST concert I have ever seen.  This concert is simply unbeliveable.  It proves to all those stupid people that the belief that U2 were only good in the 80s and 90s is a load of garbage.  U2's still got it.  This concert proves it.  If you don't think U2's good anymore, go watch this concert.  All that You Can't Leave Behind is a good album.  Maybe not as good as Joshua Tree and Achtung Baby but it is still good.  How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb left a little to be desired.  And for the stupid guy at the beginning of these reviews (I think it was the first one) what do you mean Bono was supporting homosexuality???????????  When he kissed Edge, it was representing the betrayal of Jesus Christ.  Look up the lyrics to the song that they were singing,  \\"Until the End of the World.\\"  \\"I took the money... I kissed your lips (face in the concert) and broke your heart.\\"  Bono represents Judas Iscariot in the song.  Also, if you still don't believe me and think this is some love song or something, watch any U2 concert with this song- almost all of them show Bono doing a little devil-horn thing, usually after kissing Edge (Christ) The only thing I agree with in that guy's review is that Edge really is the spirit of the band, not Bono.  I love the delay that Edge uses in his guitar.  And I hate how when people think of U2 they think of Bono.  Bono's fine but I love how Edge plays.  Anyway, go read his review if you want to find out more.  Just don't listen to that homosexuality crap.  Anyway, this concert is awesome and I could just watch it over and over again.  In fact, I'm actually watching it tonight!  Great show- makes you feel like you're actually there.  U2 is a wonderful band with good Christian messages in their songs and I can't wait for their next album and concert to come out.
B00006I53S|5.0|I knew the kit lens was pretty much garbage so I decided to take that extra $70 and put it towards a decent walk around lens instead when I bought my Rebel XT.  Actually I put that extra money towards  the 50mm 1.8 prime lens which is excellent for it price. <br /> <br />The 28-135 IS feels solid on the camera, moreso if you have the optional battery grip.  Focus is almost instantaneous and totally silent.  IS is worth the extra money if you tend to shoot landscapes and such, but since I mainly photgraph people and other moving objects (my daughter) the IS doesn't really help that much in low light. <br /> <br />  As others have stated, the IS only helps compensate for the shooters movement, not the subject you are shooting.  so if you are shooting a 1 year old in low light with IS on at 1/20 shutter, chances are that it will not be sharp. Nevertheless, I think the IS is well worth the added cost.  The lens is a great first and walkaround lens for most amatuer photographers. <br /> <br />Just this week I grabbed my bag which was mistakenly left open and my 28-135 IS came flying out and landed on the hardwood floor.  I wasnt happy at that moment, however I tried the lens out by snaping a bunch of pictures and it still looks perfect. Something to be said about its durability as well.
B00000DOYR|5.0|This album is incredible. I'm not a huge AC/DC fan but I love this album. I'm going to name off the songs with a rating 1-10 and a brief description.<br /><br />1. Hell's Bell's- I love this song. Nice touch with the church bells at the beginning. One of the first songs I ever learned to play on guitar. 10 stars<br /><br />2. Shoot to Thrill- This song is a blast. I just feel like getting up and banging my head every time I hear this. The two guitars at the beginning are cool. 10 stars<br /><br />3. What do You Do For Money, Honey- I don't particualarly care for this song. Don't get me wrong, it's good but it's not as good as the other classic songs of AC/DC. 6 1/2  stars<br /><br />4. Givin' the Dog a Bone- See description of What do You Do For Money Honey. This song is a little better but still not the best. 8 stars<br /><br />5. Let Me Put My Love Into You- This is probably the worst song on the album. I don't know- it's just kind of boring. It's ok. 5 1/2 stars<br /><br />6. Back in Black- OH YEAH!!!!! The classic AC/DC song- Back in Black is a masterpiece. This was also one of the first songs I learned how to play. It's just a fun song. 10 stars<br /><br />7. You Shook Me All Night Long- Another classic. I love this song. Just learned how to play it. This was one of the most requested songs on the radio around 2003, several years after it came out. It's timeless. 10 stars<br /><br />8. Have a Drink On Me- This song is actually kind of cool. Good classic AC/DC style. It almost reminds me of the early AC/DC before Brian Johnson started singing. Good song, but not a classic. 8 stars<br /><br />9. Shake a Leg- Ummmmmm... no. I don't care for this song. I mean almost every album has it's bad songs I guess. This is just one of those. 7 stars<br /><br />10. Rock and Roll Ain't Noise Pollution- YES! I like this song quite a bit. It's pretty famous (not as famous as some of the others on this album) but still very good. Wait to end the album with this awesome song. 9 1/2 stars
B000FA57RG|3.0|It's my mistake for buying it. So, unless your a fan/collector - don't bother - the concert version of her music isn't that great.  Beside, 1/3 of the songs on the CD weren't big singles, ie: recognizable to the general fan.  It's emabrrassing hearing her try to whine on tunes that are 20 years old....  She's a money making machine, not a well crafted tune machine - please keep this in mind before you buy $$
B00005JOQS|4.0|Superman Returns is  a great film that won't be to everyone's tastes. Instead of focusing on Superman's fight with world-conquering Super villains, Bryan Singer has chosen to contemplate Superman's changing relationships with the woman he loves, and how it alienates him from his adopted home. Considering how bland the character has been in the past, is this theme enough to occupy two-and-a-half hours of screentime? Almost. <br /> <br />Individually certain scenes make a strong impression - anything with Martha Kent, Lex and Kitty, Clark's return to the Daily Planet. But when I string them together in my head, they seem to slow the pace down. One minute I'm punching the air when Superman stages his return in that Baseball Stadium. The next minute I'm growing restless when I see Lois brush off her near-death experience in front of her new boyfriend. <br /> <br />And that's my biggest growing annoyance - the way Lois is written and portrayed in this film. The Lois in the comics (and to an extent in the Animated Series), is an ambitious reporter who has a great nose for fantastic news stories. The impression I get now is a slightly harried and selfish yuppy mum trying to juggle a great career and a five-year old kid. And I know that's really really unfair on my part. Lois's life now revolves around her little boy - her friendship with Clark (not to mention everyone else) comes a very distant second. It's so very different from the relaxed patter I've come to expect from the Daily Planet staff, and I find it really really off-putting. <br /> <br />There's enough there to enjoy that'd make me happily watch it all over again - Brandon Routh's performance as Superman, which (to me) reflects Christopher Reeve's portrayal but also brings his own sadness and pathos to the role. Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor - who I come to like more and more. And James Marsden's understated performance as Richard White, which really surprised me. The major action sequence in the film - Superman saving Air Force One, and even lifting that large island into orbit. Looking back on it, it's the fantastic opening sequence that saves it for me, because it sets the tone for the rest of the film. I also like bits and pieces of John Ottman's score. I like his \\"villain theme\\" much more than John Williams one. There's also one terrific use of the Superman cue when he's in the Baseball Stadium that I wish they'd included on the original soundtrack. And his new 'Love Theme' isn't too bad either - you can hear it at the very end of the film when Superman is saying goodnight to Lois. <br /> <br />I don't think it's as good as Batman Begins - but at some points it comes pretty damn close. I feel about Superman Returns the way I do about the first X-Men. It's an above-average Superhero film which can be used as a launching platform for bigger and better things. Looking forward to the Superman sequel...providing Warner Bros give it the greenlight.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This show is great! It's a lot better than that cr@pfest known as \\"Lost.\\" It really deserves that five star overall average. Words can't describe how devestated I was when I heard this was cancelled. Television is losing so many good TV shows (and Teen Titans was the crossing of the line for me!), and yet so many cr@ppy shows are being renewed for all new seasons (*coughs* Lost *coughs*). I really hate television these days. <br /> <br />Get this for an actually good Sci-fi TV show!
B000ETQRCM|5.0|PJ's latest album is definetly worthy of comparison to any of their previous efforts.  To those of you Pearl Jam \\"fans\\" who are stuck listening to Ten and Vs. exclusively, you have failed to realize that the band's continued success is due to their evolution as musicians, as well as with the times.  To simply swear off anything after Vs. as \\"not hard enough\\" or \\"hippy liberal junk\\" is naive and narrow in vision.  Pearl Jam is NOT a metal band.   <br /> <br />While the latest effort does have some hard songs to rock to (\\"Life Wasted\\", \\"Worldwide Suicide\\", \\"Big Wave\\"), some of the best songs on the album are a tad slower paced.  \\"Severed Hand\\" and \\"Unemployable\\" are excellent songs that aren't exactly hard rock, and even \\"Parachutes\\" is pretty damn good (it takes a while, but the song grows on you).  True fans realize that Pearl Jam is so much more than a simple hard rock band.  Their versatility as musicians is evident in the variety of songs they offer, and the meaningful lyrics make so many other rock bands just look foolish and childish.  The latest album will not dissapoint.  A great effort by a still great band.

B0000A1RJI|5.0|This has to be one of the better movie soundtracks out there. All of the songs really complement the movie and generate the atmosphere of pirates and tall ships in the caribbean. I would highly recommend the soundtrack. I have had to buy this soundtrack 4 times because  people barrow it and don't return it because it is so good.
B000001F7R|5.0|Like many other reviewers have said if this album didn't say Def Leppard on it you would never been able to guess that it was the same band that created \\"Pyromania\\" and \\"Hysteria\\", actually it would be hard to identify this with \\"High n' Dry\\"!  Unlike many people here I don't see classic hard rock influences, this album is friggn heavy metal.  This is thanks to the production of Colonel Tom Allom, which gives this group a Judas Priest like sound as opposed to their later pop-metal albums.  This was back then when Def Leppard was part of the NWOBM, a wave of British metal that emphasized on fast riffs, louder sound, sped-up drum sections, rapid-fire rhythm, and in many cases the double-guitar assault(the lattest started by the Priest).  Unlike later records the Led Zeppelin influence is alot more clearer due to the lack of pop sensibilities, giving the band a neorock sound.<br /><br />Track listing:<br />1.Rock Brigade (3:09): A Led Zeppelin influenced guitar track with a guitar solo by Pete Willis, he is actually really good.  He is a very heavy guitarist compared to Phil Coleen.<br />2.Hello America (3:27): The first music promo by the band I believe, also Led Zeppelin inspired but with a synthesizer in the background to give the song a 'layered' feeling.  Steve plays a pretty heavy riff throughout that contrasts with the background synth which is light.<br />3.Sorrow is a Woman (3:54): A dark song about women(one thing that is similar to later Leppard releases!) Steve and Pete both share lead duties on this track: 1st: Steve 2nd: Pete and then they both do a solo towards the end of the song.  Joe Elliot has a Halford like voice on this track.<br />4.It Could Be You (2:33): Has a fast track sound that slows down during the chorus, oddly bears a resemblance to the \\"Immigrant Song\\" by Led Zeppelin.<br />5.Satellite (4:28): Reminds me of \\"Evening Star\\" by the Priest, not because of the sound but because of structure.  Pretty good song, don't exactly remember what it sounds like.<br />6.When the Walls Came Tumbling Down (4:44): Can't believe Leppard actually wrote this!  It sounds like an Iron Maiden or King Diamond song with the intro and even the lyrics: \\"National suicide was proclaimed\\", as opposed to \\"Foolin'\\" or \\"Women\\"!  This is probably the darkest subject matter the band ever did since it tells of a tale of the sky turning GOLD! and everybody going crazy!  Pretty good solo by Steve.<br />7.Wasted (3:45): The great solo by Steve Clark is in this track (most notable).  The song itself is speed metal-like, bearing a resemblance to early Iron Maiden.  A minor note is Rick Allen's short drum attack after Steve's solo (which is breathtaking).  Amazing lyrical detail, even though Joe Elliot hadn't drank one ounce of whiskey when he first wrote it.<br />8.Rocks Off (3:42): An extremely guitar-driven song, they even have a part where they split the sound from Steve's guitar where it plays a riff in one ear for 2 seconds then another in the other the next.  Guitar solo is amazing, sounds like Joe Perry on steroids.<br />9.It Don't Matter (3:21): Best known for the lyrical quality, Joe Elliot has a knack for making extremely good lyrics out of a few words.  Even though it is very repeatable, the song is very good.<br />10.Answer to the Master (3:13): Heavy Metal!!!  Very Virtuosic guitar solo by one of the guys (I think it might have been Pete) that rivals EVH's \\"Light up the Sky\\" solo.  It has a loud intensity to it that is prevalent on some thrash metal records without the extreme heaviness.<br />11.Overture (7:44): Makes up for the fact that every song on here is less than 5:00 long.  Starts out with a light melody section where Joe Elliot says a little message (somewhere along the lines of \\"this message I bring to you, passed down through the ages\\") and then the group breaks out in a Boston-like jam with three solos by Steve and one by Pete.  It then ends with the same sound that was at the beginning.  My favorite of the songs on here.<br /><br />Def Leppard albums:<br />1.Pyromania<br />2.Hysteria<br />3.On Through the Night<br />4.High N' Dry<br />5.Retroactive<br />6.Adrenalize<br />7.Euphoria<br />8.X<br />9.Yeah!!<br />10.Slangeria  3.On Through the Night  4.High N' Dry  5.Retroactive  6.Adrenalize  7.Euphoria  8.X  9.Yeah!!  10.Slang

B00005JP4U|5.0|In response to the opinion that the ice sheets melting would not increase the ocean level based on an experiment with ice cubes in a glass...that reasoning is faulty.     The reason the water level in the glass does not change is because the ice cubes are already fully submerged in the water...so the mass is already located within the water level...i.e., the mass contained in the glass is the same, whether it is frozen or liquid. HOWEVER, in the case of the ice sheets melting in Greenland and Antartica, the reason the ocean levels WILL raise is because of the amount of ice ABOVE SEA LEVEL....when the frozen ice that is above sea level falls into the ocean, it ADDS water. That is why the critical areas are Greenland and Antartica, rather than the polar ice caps (where the ice is more of a floating pack of ice).     Indeed, there is natural melting and refreezing of the ice which maintains the mass balance of the ocean. However, the current concern is that geological red flags are appearing around the earth, indicating that this process is no longer balanced...the concern is that ice is melting and breaking down at a rate faster than the refreezing process.    I personally believe that global warming is a great crisis that we need to address now, based on my own research, outside of only watching An Inconvenient Truth.     If you choose to believe otherwise, you are of course entitled to that belief. But please make sure you are more informed about the matter before rushing to deny something based on false analogies.
068484267X|5.0|It's a shame that this book was written over 10 years ago and I've only discovered it now (but then I would've probably been too young to appreciate the intrinsic value of the novel.)Angela's Ashes has stirred up so many emotions inside me, emotions that I didn't even know existed. The book just deals with so many themes and issues in depth, you get the feel that you're actually there and grew up in those times. But throughout all the characters difficulties you can't help but keep that occasional grin on your face because of Frank McCourt's ability to find humor in these dire situations. This book was so remarkable 3/4 of the way through I really didn't want it to end so I tried to stall just to savor the last moments. I have nothing but praise for the author with his technique and style of storytelling combined with that ever prevalent Irish wit.Angella's Ashes is one of those books that no one should go through life without reading. Yes it's that good.
B0009X7664|5.0|A wonderful movie that brought back memories of what it was like.
B00006CXSS|4.0|I don't know what I was thinking but I kind of thought this was going to be a rockumentary on the Proclaimers, that \\"band of brothers\\" from the 90s who \\"walked 10,000 miles to be with you.\\" Does anyone know the name of that film?  I just love that song and those guys are kind of cute in a creepy way (I like their glasses).<br /><br />Anyway, this BAND OF BROTHERS ended up being a pretty good film and I'm not even into war or anything.  When I realized, pretty darn quick that this wasn't what I was looking for, I was still hooked on the story.  Still kind of confused about the name, the soldiers in the film aren't all brothers and no, there isn't a band.  I think this took place before rock and roll type bands were around anyway.
B00007KWI9|3.0|This album is one of music history's almost completely forgotten chapters.  In the beginning, a man with negligable instrumental talent yet a phenominal voice (Jon Anderson) met with a bassist who would eventually become, far and wide, one of the greatest in the history of the instrument (Chris Squire).  After recruiting a guitarist (Peter Banks), a keyboardist (Tony Kaye), and a drummer (Bill Bruford), these two men started the band we all know and love.  Yes was born.    This album has few but unmistakable instances of brilliance, and even this early on, it was quite apparent that this group--after they gained some experience--could rise to monumental heights.  And they did.  They just didn't do it by playing the music you will find on their debut album.    'Yes' (1969) is an odd creature.  First of all, the production quality is lamentable, even for 1969.  Even if music analysts might have had high hopes for Yes, certainly Atlantic records didn't.  The band were obviously shoved in a backwater studio somewhere and recorded by a totally skilless sound producer.  Second of all, there are two covers from the original set of eight tracks.  The band, while quite capable of producing its own original material, still clutched firmly to its mother's bosom, it seems.  The band at times sounds like no more than a Beatles clone, and yet, there are a few shining glimpses of something that would eventually far outstrip the scope and quality--if (unfortunately) not the popularity--of the cookie-cutter rock bands like the Beatles produced.    And that will be what I concentrate upon in this review.  Normally I would do a track-by-track breakdown, but in this instance, I will comment upon just three selections, and not in order, either.    1. \\"Beyond and Before\\" - This song is the pinnacle of the more mainstream-bound brand of Yes rock.  I consider it prudent because, while no aspect of this track is represented in the \\"Classic Period\\" of Yes (1971 through 1977), this particularselection shows another possible path the band could have taken.  Die-hard Yes fans thank their lucky stars the band didn't imitate this song in their future escapades.  Even mired within this track is the musical competency of the three core members of the band (Anderson, Squire, and Bruford), though it is not directed toward a project even approaching the magnitude of something from the Classic Period.  There is something charming about this song.  Charming, but nothing else.    8. \\"Survival\\" - This track reveals the arrangement skills of the band, as well as their penchant for slightly longer-form songs (they would extend this in years to come).  The layered vocal harmonies are more in the vein of 1960's mainstream music than the progressive mastery the band would explore in later years, but they still demonstrate the emerging vocal prowess of the band.  Most significant, however, is the experimental arrangement of this track, with a beginning section that contrasts the main song body.  Furthermore, snatches of this beginning portion are slipped into the the main song body, thereby binding the two together.  Still, this track suffers from extremely poor production, inexpertly performed backing vocals (this improves drastically by 'The Yes Album'), and horribly dated organ registration and a limited instrumental palate.    5. \\"Harold Land\\" - This, more than any other track on this album, indicates the direction in which Yes would head.  And, in my honest opinion, had they not experimented any further and had perfected this particular style, I believe they would have been successful in a completely new way.  I would not have minded listening to a band that produced work like \\"Harold Land.\\"  Instead, of course, the band gave us the unparalleled work they did in later years.    \\"Harold Land\\" is the most progressive track on the album.  Beginning with an atrociously arranged sequence (it sounds like ghastly gameshow music), the song suddenly launches into a rush of inspired brilliance.  Now where the hell was that in the beginning?!  Jon Anderson comes in, with a tone that must be heard to be believed.  It is in some ways more expressive than he would become in later years, more raw and emotionally charged.  It's also more immediate and urgent, somehow.  It's a tone I sometimes wish he would have distilled and conjured occasionally on some of the classic material.  It's a one-of-a-kind element of this very brief era of the band's catalogue.    The background vocals are really, really bad.  Some of this was the producer's fault, who let stuff like the teeth-gnashingly horrid foghorn tone to precipitate into the mix not once but twice in the \\"Going home\\" sequence.  The vocal levels are completely random; sometimes Jon is obscured by the backing vocals, sometimes the balance is correct, and other times he's blasting.  The most noticible instance of the latter is when he sings \\"There is no heart in Harold Land!\\"  Here it literally sounds like he leaned about a millimeter away from the microphone when he belted out that line.  All these things are sort of charming, yet much more unfortunate.  This song deserved a better arrangement, and certainly better production.  Where was Eddie Offord when the band needed him?    There are some generalities that apply to this album.  Jon Anderson's vocals are spot-on.  Even wreathed in the substandard background vocals of his bandmates, one can hear Jon's distinctive, optimistic tone lilting upon the ugly oil sea of his bandmates.  Also, Squire and Bruford have occasional moments that show their singular talents on their respective instruments.  In addition, there are fleeting glimpses of the compositional brilliance--most notably on \\"Harold Land\\"--the band would develop in later years.  Finally, and probably most apparent, the lyrics are not the high-brow, esoteric material the band would first explore in 'The Yes Album.'  Jon Anderson had not yet become the commendable poet he would be in later years and on later albums.  All the material on this album is highly accessible lyrically.    Is this album anywhere near the work the band would later produce?  Absolutely not.  And I must judge it by the same standard by which I judge the other Yes material.  And when your curve is set by the greatest album in all of music (1972's 'Close to the Edge'), somehow this debut album--though unfairly overlooked--just pales in comparison.  No, 'Yes' doesn't even come close to the Classic Period of the band's canon, but is it an essential album for die-hard Yes fans to own?  Absolutely!  You truly have to pay homage to the phenominal bunch of talent that is Yes, and what better way to do that then by starting at the beginning and glimpsing between the fronds the rising sun that would eventually reach over the horizon in 1971, with 'The Yes Album.'
B00005GL0Q|5.0|1966 and 1967 could be considered one of the first true \\"golden ages\\" for Rock Music. This is one span where creativity really took off in the Rock world. This creativity was twofold: 1) Technology was improving and Studio Recording techniques were becoming better - thus a better product was being produced; 2) The Times - with the state of society during this time period - Vietnam, etc was raising the bar on songwriting. . Artists such as Bob Dylan were beginning to emerge with some top notch work.   Many people consider the Beatles' \\"Revolver\\" album as the collection that was the impetus to this \\"Golden Age\\".    It was in response to \\"Revolver\\" that Brian Wilson and the Beach Boys would release \\"Pet Sounds\\" which in turn would have the Beatles respond back with \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\".   Going back to \\"Revolver\\", this wasn't the first effort at the Beatles going off on a creative kick.   Back in 1965, the Beatles had released \\"Rubber Soul\\" that saw songs like \\"Michelle\\" (with the French influence) and \\"Nowhere Man\\" (outstanding from a lyrical standpoint).   No doubt that \\"Revolver\\" would elevate the Beatles as a creative force, however I still think subsequent efforts like \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\" and \\"Abbey Road\\" would prove to be stronger collections. <br /> <br />\\"Revolver\\" shows the creative force of the Beatles in multiple ways.   We see things from both a musical and lyrical perspective.   For example - from the musical perspective, we see the incorporation of Indian Music into the George Harrison penned tune, \\"Love You To\\", the classical music influence in \\"Eleanor Rigby\\", and the early psychedelic influences in \\"Tommorow Never Knows\\".   Songs such as \\"Eleanor Rigby\\", \\"I'm Only Sleeping\\", \\"For No One\\",  and \\"Taxman\\" demonstrate some improved lyrics.    <br /> <br />There are 12 tracks on this collection.  It is worth noting that all songs are basically in 2 to 3 minutes with the longest tracks \\"I'm Only Sleeping\\" and \\"Love YouTo\\" coming in at 3:01.  Here is a synopsis of each: <br /> <br />\\"Taxman\\": This is a George Harrison penned track with Harrison on lead vocals.  This song definitely takes shots at Britain'stax policy (where the wealthy were heavily taxed).  Line such as \\"There's one for you, nineteen for me\\" and \\"Should five per cent appear too small; Be Thankful I don't take it all\\" tell the story.  From an instrumentation standpoint, it didn't bowl me over - although it has a standard 60s feel. <br /> <br />\\"Eleanor Rigby\\":  As mentioned above - this song is a masterpiece both from a lyrical and musical standpoint.  The lyrics about loneliness really are good and the classical music helps compliment the lyrics perfectly.   Paul McCartney shines on lead vocals. <br /> <br />\\"I'm Only Sleeping\\": This is an underrated track.   John Lennon does a great job on the lead vocals.   Some of the lyrics remind me of his latter work, \\"Watching the Wheels\\" - namely when he says, \\"Keeping an eye of the world going by my window; Taking my time\\". <br /> <br />\\"Love You To\\": This is Harrison's contribution with the Indian influence with instruments such as the tabla and sitar.  I give Harrison credit for doing something groundbreaking and while it is a good song, it doesn't bowl me over. <br /> <br />\\"Here, There, Everywhere\\":  This song with McCartney on lead vocals is good, but again I would say it isn't a great song.  Listen to the first 5 seconds of the song - it has some parallels to the open notes of Paul's latter work - \\"Live and Let Die\\". <br /> <br />\\"Yellow Submarine\\":  While Lennon and McCartney wrote this song, it is Ringo Starr who sings lead vocals.   I always liked Ringo's contributions (especially \\"A Little Help From My Friends\\") and this song is no exception - great song.   I love some of the horn work in this song.    The song might be a bit silly from a lyrical standpoint, but the chorus definitely has a mantra-like feel to it.   There even is a touch of psychedlica in this song. <br /> <br />\\"She Said, She Said\\":  Another great job by Lennon on the lead vocals.   Like \\"I'm Only Sleeping\\", this is an underrated track.  I like Ringo's contributions on the drums - great cymbal work on this song.   <br /> <br />\\"Good Day Sunshine\\": This song is well known and has a classic Beatles feel thanks to McCartney's lead vocals and piano work.  McCartney's bass does a great job at opening the song and then Ringo provides more great drum work.  I like the \\"Rag Time\\" music bridge in the middle of the song. <br /> <br />\\"And Your Bird Can Sing\\":  Lennon sings on another underrated track.   It has more of an early Beatles feel to it.  At 2:01, it is tied for the shortest track, but this track will easily have you wanting more. <br /> <br />\\"For No One\\": This song might have Paul's strongest vocals.  It has strong lyrics as well as this song deals with Paul's relationship with Jane Asher.  Also at 2:01, this song will have you wanting more. <br /> <br />\\"Doctor Robert\\": This song deals with a doctor who provided drugs to his patients.  Many believe this doctor was Dr. Robert Heyman who provided drugs to his celebrity patients. <br /> <br />\\"I Want to Tell You\\": This song is a Harrison written song with Harrison on lead vocals.  The piano work in this song is strong and really shines. <br /> <br />\\"Got to Get You Into My Life\\":  This is classic Beatles song.   The horn work really laid the foundation for Earth, Wind, and Fire to cover this song a decade later - but the original by the Beatles still shines.  Paul McCartney's vocals are outstanding. <br /> <br />\\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\":  Lennon shines again on a very underrated track.  Many people consider this song the impetus to the whole psychedelic movement of the late 1960s.    <br /> <br />It's too bad the lyrics weren't packaged with this CD.  Overall, I very good CD.   I still think better work came with the latter albums, but no doubt this album laid the foundation.   Highly recommended.

In other words people who have had some training in the past which they are now looking to put into practice.  This is not my situation. I have none the less found the book to be very useful as a guide to the practical principles to be followed in Enlgish language teaching.  Though it does not include very much in the way of sample activities or grammer rules, the principles the book discusses, if creativly applied, have the potential to offer a much more versitile range of activities then a collection straight forward lesson plans to follow or model after. <br />Admitedly I have not yet started teaching so I have not yet been able try it out.

0743506650|5.0|Now I know why Stephen King is maggot-obsessed! He reveals stories from his childhood that contributed to who he is now, along with guidelines and seasoned advice for writers and wannabes. The reader (or listener - I love hearing a book read by the author, especially in this case, as his voice adds so much to his words) will understand the respect King has for great writers and the contempt he has for those who just get by.<br /><br />He addresses sentence construction in detail, right down to the deplorable, flowery and unnecessary adverbs. (He really, really, really hates them!) ;)  But more importantly King focuses on the STORY.  Create a situation and see, along with your readers, what is going to happen. He detests a plot nearly as much as an adverb.<br /><br />Readers are fortunate that he continued to perfect his craft in spite of all of the early rejection notices and his writing students are blessed that he wrote \\"On Writing.\\" If you have ANY interest in becoming a great (or even decent) writer, order this today.  My personal recommendation is the audio CD.
B000ETRCMQ|4.0|I had just seen \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" a few weeks prior to \\"Transamerica\\" and was ready for a kinder, gentler gender-bender genre movie.  So I was pleased with \\"Transamerica.\\" <br />The plot has some holes and the acting is a bit strained, but overall, the movie is entertaining and educational.  Many straights and non-straights are informed about the G and L but less aware of the B and T of GLBT.  So the movie is a good introduction to transgender issues and challenges, presented with a soft, almost \\"sweet\\" touch.  \\"Transamerica\\" and \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" taken together are sort of a Yin and Yang or Sweet and Sour experience, yet both are authentic within their topical contexts.  Amidst the unfolding plot of Transamerica, we see how both heterosexuals and Gays can be challenged by trans-sexuality, and overcome prejudices.  It's not a great movie, but a very good movie, and one that is timely and tender. <br />Stan Ousley Jr.

B000G75AE8|5.0|The new SLAYER cd crushes, plain and simple.  People are bashing this release and I question how long they have been listening to the group or they're a bunch of haters, 'cause they have nothing better to do.  The biggest thing is Lombardo returns on drums.  He detroys Bostaph.  I have been into Slayer since the early 80's, I still remember when Hell Awaits came out, many years ago.  I have seen them numerous times with Lombardo and with Bostaph.  There has never been a doubt who the better drummer was.  I mean Bostaph is a decent drummer, but he never pulled off the double bass part, at the end of Angel Of Death, NEVER.  It was always sloppy, slow and pathetic.  Lombardo drums like a machine on this.  Anyway this is their most brutal record since Reign in Blood.  So what if Kerry King writes some hardcore stomps on this release, it's still 100% SLAYER.  Some of those stomps during Skeleton Christ and Jihad will have people murdering eachother in the SLAYER pits, no doubt.  And to top it all off the last song, Supremist.  This song is probably one of the most brutal songs the band has ever done.  There is even a blast beat that goes on for a few seconds.  A first for the band, it's awesome!!!  Lyrics are the typical SLAYER fare, against christ, religion, politics.  Cool, but nothing too new, except lyrics for Jihad may upset a few people.  Whatever.  The band are in their 40's and have never put out a bad record, just some better than others.  In the heavy/thrash metal history no band has ever been as consistent as SLAYER.  They rule and this cd is awesome, probably my favorite since Reign in Blood.  Do not listen to the people bashing this for the sake of bashing.  It's 100% SLAYER, just better now that Lombardo is back behind the kit.
1400034205|4.0|While nothing overly dramatic occurs in the story I still found it entirely interesting in that it is simply a second-hand account of a person's journey on the path rarely followed.   The writer, as narrator, occasionally speaks directly to the reader as though it were a private conversation which lends itself nicely to the reserved tone of the story.  The writer/narrator has a keen eye for detail so that the story becomes almost fascinating -- especially for those, like the secondary characters and perhaps the narrator himself, who tend to shy away from the mystical and spiritual.  One need not buy into these things in order to participate in and enjoy the yarn.  <br />I also liked that the story spanned several actual historical events, the impacts of which were incorporated into the lives of the characters.
0884271536|5.0|I've been introduced to CCPM (critical chain project management) years ago in school, but thought it was boring. Reading Goldratt's novel opened my mind to it in a much deeper way, and I'm now using it at my work with great success. I also recommend his other business novels.
B00005JOYM|4.0|I saw this film today, and can understand why people don't want to see the film.  But too often today, we want to forget what happened that day and wipe it from our memories.  But we can't do that.  We need to remember 9/11 always as we remeber other historic events.  Sometimes the best way to do that is with film.  And so long as you tell a true story as it happened, it is more important.  World Trade Center is a great film, but it has small aspects to it that Stone missed that good have made it better.  But one thing Oliver Stone did right was not to inject the film with his trademark paranoia and cinicism.  He tell the story from the point of view of two port authority cops and tells their story of survival.  The acting is supurb, and the visuals stunning.  You really felt as if you were there. <br />And now for the small things I didn't like.  Stone seemed afraid to show the planes crashing into the towers, and so we never see it happen.  I know that would be difficult to see, but that is what happened.  And as much as we would all like to erase that from our memories, it happened just the same.  Stone also seemed afraid to say it was Islamic terrorism that caused this horrific event.  On both of these counts, Paul Greengrass's United 93 is not afraid to show.  Which is why that film is superior to World Trade Center. <br />But for all it's flaws, World Trade Center is worth it to see, and helps you remember all the good in the world.  This was the first Oliver Stone movie I actually liked.
B000001IQH|5.0|When I first got this album, the only thing I was thinking was \\"Wow, 19 songs, that's a bit long.\\" I usually like my albums shorter, as when loads of songs are packed on, you usually end up with alot of filler. Well, I put in \\"...And Out Come The Wolves\\", and before I knew it, it was over, and I wanted more.  <br /> <br />When it comes to energetic, fast, infectious punk rock, these guys know how its done. Every song packs a punch, and just as one great song ends, another one starts immediately. This album never slows down, and keeps you pumped up the whole way through (and that's how punk should be). From the fabulous beginning with the short and sweet Maxwell Murder down to the equally as fabulous The Way I Feel, \\"...And Out Come The Wolves \\" delivers a load of just great music. Roots Radicals, Time Bomb, Lock Step & Gone, Listed M.I.A., Ruby Soho, and As Wicked are just some examples of the awesome music you will hear on this album. <br /> <br />If you are a fan of punk music, this album is without a doubt a MUST HAVE. This is easily one of the greatest punk albums ever done, and definitely Rancid's best. Their excellent combinaton of punk, ska, reggae, etc. make for an unforgettable album that you'll find yourself listening to over and over again.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|It was the good old year off 1984, I turned on my radio and was casually skipping threw channels, and then I heard \\"True Men Don't Kill Coyotes\\", I learned quite alot about them on the radio that day, that they were a new funk band named Red Hot Chili Peppers, and that the band contained off 4 members which where, Anthony Kiedis, Michael Balzary (Flea), Cliff Martinez (Later to be replaced by Jack Irons, Chad Smith) and Jack Sherman (later to be replaced by Hillel Slovak, John Frusciante, Dave Navarro, John Frusciante). <br />I went out and bought there self titled debut, I was amazed by the young Flea's bass playing definately on \\"Get Up And Jump\\". <br />By the time off 1985 I was a huge fan buying merchandise, which would be quite expensive to this date (but I won't sell), when I heard that they had brought out a new album I leaped up out of my chair and rushed to my local retailer Freaky Styley I thought was immensly better than there debut, I loved \\"Jungle Man\\" above all, while still loving songs such as, \\"Sex Rap\\" and \\"Catholic School Girls Rule\\", I actaully managed to see that video, 3 days before it was banned. <br />The Uplift Mofo Party Plan came out in 1987, it seemed such a long wait since there debut and Freaky Styley where only 1 year apart, and I did buy Abbey Road E.P but that only had other songs from there past albums, so it wasnt anything special. I loved the song \\"Behind The Sun\\" and is still considered to be one off my favourite Chili's song to date, though some Stadium Arcadium comes close. <br />1989 Mother's Milk, by this time people had started to realise there potential, with there Stevie Wonder hit \\"Higher Ground\\", then followed another great single \\"Taste The Pain\\", by this time the 4 memebers which are today were there, John Frusciante had joined with Chad Smith and Flea and Anthony where still there. At this moment in time though I was very sad about the 1988 death off Hilel Slovak, but I still respected this young John Frusciante.  <br/>Then came the masterpiece that everyone recognised Blood Sugar Sex Magik, 1991, with songs like \\"Give It Away\\", \\"Under The Bridge\\", \\"Suck My Kiss\\" and \\"If You Have To Ask\\" they were bound to win a grammy. All Chili's fans where buzzing about \\"Under The Bridge\\" while differant it was still brilliant, I still remember the day I went into the music store the day it was released with high expectations, which where deffinately forfilled, it was a masterpiece. <br />To my horror I heard that John Frusciante had left and was replaced by a Dave Navarro, I could not understand why. But still I waited eagerly for One Hot Minute, 1995, when I first but it into my CD player I knew it was going to be differant, it was almost like I expected the worst, while songs like \\"My Friends\\", where very good the rest off the album was abit off a downer, though I was still a loyal fan. <br />To my delight on 1997 it was annouced that John Frusciante was coming back, then followed 1999's Californacation, however differant and much maturer, it was great, not my favourite but great, I was first suprised by there change in genre, but I realised they had maturered, and so had I by that time, as I was getting older. <br />Then in 2000 it was annouced that Anthony Kiedis was now clean, I felt really happy for him, and with that came By The Way, the only songs I really liked where \\"Universally Speaking\\", \\"The Zephyr Song\\" and \\"I Could Die For You\\", I thought maybe it was time to wave goodbye to them, after all it was rumoured they where having arguements. <br />I was even more sure they where going to quit, when \\"Fortune Faded\\", was released which way trying to promote there greatest hits, at that point all I was thinking off was them and how I would miss there music. <br />2005 I was told by a friend that they were in the process off a new album, at this I was immensly relieved they where going to carry on, and what seemed like 5 years, Stadium Arcadium was released, I was unsure when I put it in my CD player for the first time, it was like when I put One Hot Minute in, but this time I was not disapointed, I decided to listen to the Mars disk first, simply because I thought \\"Desecration Smile\\" had a good name, so I played it for the first time, and already impressed, then came \\"Tell Me Baby\\", I felt the same way I felt the day I first heard \\"I Could Have Lied\\", after I had listened to all off the Mars disk, I turned on Jupiter, this what I thought was impossible as I adored Mars, became my favourite disk off the two. This album for me is my favourite off theres' as it bring songs such as \\"Hump de Bump\\" whichhave a funk sound type and songs like \\"Slow Cheetah\\", \\"Snow ((Hey Oh))\\" which have that By The Way sound to it and Californacation sound. <br />Great work from a great band, who I have loved since they first started. All hail the Red Hot Chili Peppers.
B000000W5N|5.0|Sticky Fingers is a testament to the fact that the Stone's best album tracks are way better than any of their hits. From the sleazy opener \\"Brown Sugar\\" to the gorgeous closer, \\"Moonlight Mile\\", there isn't a single dull moment. I can't really do a track by track analysis(since every song is so good), but I can tell that this is essential to anyone's music collection. On  e of the best, period.
B000ANVQ0K|5.0|This movie is one of the best movies of all time.  Only one part made me think.  Why were they making out that the rich man was evil.  He was only protecting what was his.  Kate Winslet was okay, but i wish they would have gotten Alyson Hannigan to play her part.  That would have been awesome.
B0000584V3|5.0|Is it their best? It's right up there, maybe second best. Does it have the most variety? In my opinion, yes. Even though this is the second Opeth album I listened to, it is probably what turned me on to them the most. So, like the other reviewers have recommended, do start here if you're new, because something such as my favorite Opeth album, \\"Deliverance,\\" takes a while to appreciate. Even though I don't mention anything about the specific tracks on Opeth albums, due to the difficulty to distinguish one absolutely amazing track from the others, I will here. \\"Harvest\\" may very well be the most beautiful song I've heard in my entire life. It is completely breath-taking. The two bonus tracks are great, but I feel that they might be a little out of place on this disc, considering that they are strictly soft and peaceful. However, that is the one and ONLY downfall i can find about this album, and besides, that hardly counts. So, if you like Opeth, you already own this, and you love it. If you don't like Opeth, you should start listening to them, because they will keep you entertained for hours upon hours, as they do for me. Thank you for your time.
B000002GWN|5.0|M. Allen Greenbaum's excellent review mostly says it all for me. Apart from the other criticisms, yes, Woodstock is absolutely murdered: that bass riff is not just dated and inappropriate to the song, it is boring in its own right.<br /><br />However I think he was a little harsh in his criticism of Tom Scott's contributions - he plays some tasty sax, definitely not dated from my point of view. And I think Joni and the band sound good together on the first track.<br /><br />My other disagreement with Mr Greenbaum and other reviewers is their seeming lack of regard for the last 2 songs which I happen to really like. Apart from the first track these are the only ones where Joni's singing styles and the band's feel and groove really fit together: reminiscent of the best Steely Dan - sophisticated pop that can serve as high class background music or rewarding listening music. Being completely different in feel from every other song on the CD, I suspect they were written with this particular band in mind, or at least more time and thought was given to the arrangements.<br /><br />As a fan of Mitchell's stunningly artistic vocal decisions and delivery I would buy this cd just for her rendition of Both Sides Now, despite the last part of the song being wrecked by the incongruous funk-style bass and the cheesy ending.  The 3 star rating is only in comparison with Joni's best ( such as Mingus, Hissing of Summer Lawns, Clouds, Shadows and Light).<br /><br />Edit: In light of comment below I have changed star rating to \\"5\\".
B00008OLYN|5.0|Behold, \\"Damnation,\\" Opeth's second half of their double album, along with \\"Deliverance,\\" naturally. Contrary to its title, this CD is tranquil and selene throughout. Please, though, do not implant it on your brain that this disc is 'too light'. However, it is like nothing Opeth has ever done before. There remain no transitions from death metal elements to equableness on \\"Damnation\\". That's not to say they dont reappear on \\"Ghost Reveries,\\" so fear not. I feel that this album does not provide the listener with that signature Opeth 'experience', let me finish before you begin to think I don't love this album. It doesn't give that signature Opeth 'experience' because it gives a brand NEW experience to the listener, which was the purpose of the double album release. In doing this, Opeth has showed both sides of their playing style, and that the two musn't constantly be taking turns in a single track to sound great, each style is its own unique Opeth genre. In my opinion, \\"Damnation\\" is the more diverse playing style of the two albums, just because this is much more than than the frequently-occuring yet still dreamy acoustic sections of Opeth's compositions. Still, \\"Deliverance\\" remains my favorite of the two, due to its leaving me in utter awe each time i hear it. Skip picking this up, and you will regret it. Do NOT be afraid of an experiment. Thank you for your time.
B0002VEPRQ|5.0|Is there anyone left on the planet who does not know MARY POPPINS?  Made in 1963-1964, after a thirty year battle to convince a very stubborn and possessive P. L.  Travers  to give Walt Disney the rights to her book(s), it may be the Disney Studios' crowning film achievement.  It is a wonderful movie, a flawless blend of live action and animation, with some of the most beautiful and detailed matte paintings in movie history.  Julie Andrews, who won a Best Actress Oscar in her film debut, is the perfect nanny in 1910 Edwardian England to Jane and Michael Banks (Karen Dotrice and Matthew Garber).  And the movie won four other technical and music Oscars, with a still untopped thirteen total nominations.<br /><br />With chimney sweep/street artist/best buddy Bert (Dick Van Dyke in peak form), Mary Poppins leads Jane and Michael on many magical adventures.  These include a live-action/animation day in the park (\\"Supercalifragilisticexpealidocis\\"), a tea party on a ceiling with Ed Wynn as Uncle Albert, the hauntingly beautiful \\"Feed the Birds\\" with bird woman Jane Darwell, and the Oscar-winning \\"Chim-Chim-Curree\\" on the rooftops of London.  (Peter Ellenshaw allegedly did 100 breathtakingly beautiful and detailed matte paintings for this movie, winning a well-deserved visual effects Oscar.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the Banks family is controlled like clockwork by Mr. Banks (a perfectly cold and stuffy David Tomlinson, who turns 180 degrees over the movie's fast-paced 140 minutes.  (Cotton Warburton won an Editing Oscar.)  Glynis Johns is an ideal and likeable suffragette and feminist Mrs. Banks.  Mr. Banks works in the bank and constantly wants his kids to open a bank account, but they are always off playing with Mary Poppins or  Bert.<br /><br />MARY POPPINS is a fabulous feast of a movie, with some of the greatest visual effects and most beautiful matte paintings I have ever seen.  The cast is perfection, the writing something that even grouchy Pamela Travers should be pleased with.  And the 40th anniversary restoration on DVD has shimmeringly rich color, crystal-clear image clarity, and awesome 5.1 Home Theatre Mix THX sound to top any theater sound system.<br /><br />Disk 2 runs over three hours and includes composer Richard Sherman giving us deleted songs that ended up in other Disney animated movies, were cut for sheer length on a movie that runs almost two-and-a-half hours without them, and chats with Julie Andrews and Dick Andrews.  A full hour behind-the-scenes documentary shows how most of the magnificent visual effects were achieved, should you want the illusion spoiled.  We see the battle to get P.L. Travers to let Walt Disney film her precious baby of a novel over three full decades and working over the screenplay to make it all seamless plot-wise.  Finally, we have long lost footage of the Grauman's Chinese Theatre Los Angeles world premiere in August 1964 and various movie trailers for those who want to know how this very magical masterpiece was marketed.<br /><br />The two-disk 40th anniversary DVD of MARY POPPINS belongs in every house with kids--and kids at  heart.  With it, a hundred filmmaking aspects come together perfectly to create a masterpiece that gets my vote as Walt Disney's crowning film achievement.
B000002UB3|5.0|I have a friend who thinks the Beatles sucked and had no influence on music (really!).  I wish I could force him to listen to this. <br />In many ways most of the last 30(40?) years of music would not exist without the Beatles. <br />Musically,sonically,lyrically,emotionally, this was the way to say goodbye to the Beatles.  Just think of how they would have continued ........
0060751967|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  If you like Lindsay Sands writings, there's a very similar flavor, but I think they are funnier.  I've also read her other book, Vamps in the City, and look forward to future titles.
B000002UAO|4.0|It's the Beatles so it is GREAT!  But...I guess I missed in the description or it wasn't there that this is NOT the same as the album I loved as a pre-teen.  It must be the world or british release as it is missing songs and has songs that my lp does not. <br />This is fine but to evoke the memories of long ago the order of songs and familiarity from hundreds on listenings as a youngster is missing. <br />I actuall prefer to play the old lp and I am not someone who prefers crackles and pops in my music. <br />I guess I'm not really happy with it.
B0000648WZ|1.0|As a generic \\"mean soldiers kill nasty alien bugs movie\\", this is at best okay (on a good day if you had a couple of beers).  The book is a thousand times better.  Heinlein beautifully weaves the growth of a boy into a man and soldier, with great action and a healthy dose of political philosophy, into a classic tale that leaves you thinking. It is a book you can re-read forever.
B000G75AE8|4.0|As a lifelong Slayer fan I must say this is my favorite since Seasons (and I really like GHUA).  38 min. yet the songs don't feel too short.  After 2 listens Skeleton Christ really stands out for me.  For the 1st time since seasons you can understand what Tom is singing without even a glance at the lyric sheet.  As always the one glaring weakness of any Slayer production is the lack of a bottom end in the mix.  Someday I hope to hear the bass & get a little thump (a la Tool, Static-X or Korn) in the bass & bass drum.  Song writing is very tight and they genuinely seem to be happy to be playing together.  Well worth the price and then some.
1401302378|3.0|The problem with the internet love-fest is the fact that the virtual world is everything and the physical world means nothing. Although the ideas in this book are put into a digital context, the  writing is repetive, just as many internet sites and trends are. <br /> <br />The hard truth of the matter is that we do not need endless supplies of physical products in the world, but virtual products do not have the same emotive qualities and they never will. Full sensory experiences depend upon physical interactions, between people and objects, because we are physical beings. The Long Tail tends to define categories of things, virtual things, as being fulfilling and allowing major internet retailers the chance to make a dime off of the smaller sales. While this is great for the aggregators, it does nothing for the individuals trying to make a living selling things that simply do not warrant their sale. Waste is a part of America and the Long Tail promotes continued waste.
B0009YA386|4.0|I'm sorry, but every time I read anything about the Editors, there is a comparison to Interpol. UGH. I've never liked Interpol, yet I LOVE this band. I've seen Intertpol live (opening for the Cure) and I was extremely underwhelmed. I've seen the Editors live and they were electric! The songs from the debut and a number of \\"b\\" sides were played with an almost manic energy and a number of the cuts, most notably \\"Open Your Arms,\\" were faster and far more aggressive than the studio cuts. <br />Anyway, I would be much more likely to compare this band to older UK bands like Echo & The Bunnymen or Joy Division than Interpol...probably because I like those bands and I'm old enough to have seen them both live in their prime.  <br />At the end of the day, this band should be compared to no one. I am sure this cd is only the beginning of something very impressive. They played a few new songs at the show the other night and those songs were actually better than most of the cuts on The Back Room. Especially the one throw away track, \\"Camera,\\" which should have been a b-side....and the one reason I didn't give this one 5 stars.
0811826848|4.0|Very Interesting and the photos are great. Beatle lovers will enjoy this anthology, but I would recommend the book The Beatles by Bob Spitz.
B000002TPS|5.0|Youthanasia (1994.), Megadeth's sixth studio album<br /><br />The early 90's saw Dave Mustaine's Megadeth enter their golden years as a band. With the recruitment of guitar genius Marty Friedman and drummer Nick Menza at the start of the decade, the band had what would become their classic line-up in place. From these changes came firstly 1990's `Rust In Peace', one of the greatest metal albums of all time in my opinion and following this, 1992's `Countdown To Extinction', which was a little more commercial and less thrashy but never the less compromised nothing in songwriting excellence and was a classic album in it's own right. By the mid-1990's though, musical tastes were changing rapidly, metal had maintained popularity alongside the alternative rock burst at first but by 1994, grunge rock was all the more predominant and other acts such as the rap-metal styled Rage Against The Machine were gaining popularity. The metal scene was going underground again. That aside though, how did Megadeth's `Youthanasia' fare?<br /><br />At the time of it's release, `Youthanasia' sold copies faster than anything else Megadeth had produced and would subsequently produce and peaked at #4 on the billboard. Dave Mustaine and his band make no compromises again with their sound though to fit in with the current musical trends at the time and credit to them for doing that. The album met with good critical reviews upon it's release however for some reason some fans found the album too `poppy'. I personally struggle to come to terms with this view, seen as `Youthanasia' for me comes across as being less commercial than it's predecessor `Countdown To Extinction'. The guitars for me are a little heavier and crunchier and the songwriting is darker and moodier. This is perhaps a good reflection of Dave Mustaine at the time of the album's making where he was becoming frustrated with other band members wanting to write more songs as well as other tensions. There are songs on the album that have a little commercial feel to them, but no way for me is this album poppy. The album was a victim obviously to some `fans' who only liked Megadeth because they were fast and heavy, not because they were Megadeth. Bands develop from their original stylings; ok so this ain't thrashy and fast like `Rust In Peace', get over it and embrace an intelligently developing band with an open mind. After all, it is even as if Megadeth sold out their sound with this album; just look at the beautiful `A Tout Le Monde' - MTV censored the video because the lyrics were `disturbing' on the suicide theme. Dave Mustaine and Megadeth bow down to no-one on this disc. These irritations I have about peoples perceptions of the post-thrash era Megadeth aside, this is one awesome album. Dave Mustaine's lyrics and his vocal delivery of them throughout the album is awesome and he deals with various `difficult issues' such as incest on `Family Tree' and suicide on `A Tout Le Monde' really well. The riffs are heavy, dark and crunchy throughout the album giving way to some mesmerising musical sequences. The album is no slouch on the solos front either and as is per usual for a Megadeth album, there are lots of them and they all shine.<br /><br />Following Megadeth's re-union in 2004 with the release of 'The System Has Failed', Dave Mustaine personally helped remaster the band's back catalogue. With 'Youthanasia', the remaster is excellent. All of the guitar lines shine through the remaster, the drums are crisp sounding and the bass is ever present. Mustaine's vocals also sound great. The remaster has a demo of the classic `A Tout Le Monde' with slightly different lyrics in the French chorus. Also included is a previously unreleased song called `Millenium Of The Blind' and `New World Order' and a nice instrumental in `Absolution'.<br /><br />A slow, brooding and foreboding riff gets the album going with `Reckoning Day'. A very strong and atmospheric opening track with a great chorus. I like Mustaine's growled and sometimes distorted vocals on this opener. One of the album's finest efforts in `Train Of Consequences' follows, with it's unusual scratchy riffs and clanging basslines. The verses and chorus are effortless and the solos are great. `Addicted To Chaos' is a sludgier and moodier affair with some quite introspective lyrics, again love the chorus; very effective, as is the echoey `Addicted!' vocal exit. The amazing `A Tout Le Monde' is next. The song about suicide is one of Dave Mustaine's finest songwriting moments and the song pans out to be a timeless ballad styled tune, a great change of pace. Freidman's solo is also astounding and the harmony to end the track is excellent. The more poppy but enjoyable `Elysian Fields' is next. The riffs are catchier on this one and less dark and the harmonised chorus makes a great sound. `Killing Road' has a vintage Megadeth opening with the solo guitar riffing and bass/drum interjections. Lyrically truthful abouts it's subject matter, it has more great riffs and fine solos.<br /><br />`Blood Of Heroes' is next up. Another slower and in some ways ghostly sounding song, which is appropriate for it's content again. The song has a sirine opening and catchy riffs. Mustaine's vocals have a slighlty different but good sound to them. The chorus is awesome. After this is another one of the album's gems in `Family Tree'. This is a fantastic track which has some rather disturbing subject matter about...incest. The song has some nice contrasts, ranging from a whispery verse and built to climax in the chorus. `Youthanasia' is a solid title track about the forgotten generations. Mustaine's lyrics carry the song very well and are the centrepiece. The bonecrunching chorus is also very effective. `I Thought I Knew It All' is another solid metal song, not too spectcular but featuring some great guitar work in the chorus (I'll say it again, this album has some really cool choruses right through). `Black Curtains' is on a similar level, a little bit slow and stately nevertheless it generates a gloomy atmospheric for the song, as was probably intended. Then though we come to perhaps one of Megadeth's greatest tracks in `Victory'. This for me is without doubt the finest track on the album and is Megadeth at their very best. Only Dave Mustaine could pen lyrics using song titles from his previous albums, but he does it here in this song to create a song to show he has been a victory over drugs and has survived his excessive addictions, `some crazy shit has happened since the conjuring' indeed. That aside, this song has fantastic riffs and a rip roaring chorus that's a real sing along, not that I personally identify with Mustaine's years of heroin and cocaine usage of course! The song has a great, urgent drive and has a vintage soloing section which is the song's highlight. Mustaine and Freidman trade off 4 magnificent solos.<br /><br />So there we have it, the much underrated IMO `Youthanasia'. Megadeth may have developed and outgrown their earlier thrash roots but they are no way watered down artistically on this album; this album is 50 minutes of kick ass heavy metal with plenty of awesome moments. Another classic, this is the 3rd of 3 five star efforts from the Freidman/Mustaine/Menza/Ellefson era of the band, which is without the best Megadeth ever had. A must for any metal fan, you'll be missing out if you don't own this one!ted vocals on this opener.

A must for any metal fan, you'll be missing out if you don't own this one!
B00005JOYM|1.0|I can barely breathe when I begin to recall the truly evil events that occurred. Even if it were free I wouldn't watch it,to actually PAY FOR a movie that will essentially make me vomit is beyond all comprehension. To each his/her own, I certainly don't condemn people for seeing it. I do however condemn hollywood for making it. Words can't convey the twisting inside this ever present sadness that has only recently started to fade. <br /> <br />
B0002EXH40|5.0|Youthanasia (1994.), Megadeth's sixth studio album<br /><br />The early 90's saw Dave Mustaine's Megadeth enter their golden years as a band. With the recruitment of guitar genius Marty Friedman and drummer Nick Menza at the start of the decade, the band had what would become their classic line-up in place. From these changes came firstly 1990's `Rust In Peace', one of the greatest metal albums of all time in my opinion and following this, 1992's `Countdown To Extinction', which was a little more commercial and less thrashy but never the less compromised nothing in songwriting excellence and was a classic album in it's own right. By the mid-1990's though, musical tastes were changing rapidly, metal had maintained popularity alongside the alternative rock burst at first but by 1994, grunge rock was all the more predominant and other acts such as the rap-metal styled Rage Against The Machine were gaining popularity. The metal scene was going underground again. That aside though, how did Megadeth's `Youthanasia' fare?<br /><br />At the time of it's release, `Youthanasia' sold copies faster than anything else Megadeth had produced and would subsequently produce and peaked at #4 on the billboard. Dave Mustaine and his band make no compromises again with their sound though to fit in with the current musical trends at the time and credit to them for doing that. The album met with good critical reviews upon it's release however for some reason some fans found the album too `poppy'. I personally struggle to come to terms with this view, seen as `Youthanasia' for me comes across as being less commercial than it's predecessor `Countdown To Extinction'. The guitars for me are a little heavier and crunchier and the songwriting is darker and moodier. This is perhaps a good reflection of Dave Mustaine at the time of the album's making where he was becoming frustrated with other band members wanting to write more songs as well as other tensions. There are songs on the album that have a little commercial feel to them, but no way for me is this album poppy. The album was a victim obviously to some `fans' who only liked Megadeth because they were fast and heavy, not because they were Megadeth. Bands develop from their original stylings; ok so this ain't thrashy and fast like `Rust In Peace', get over it and embrace an intelligently developing band with an open mind. After all, it is even as if Megadeth sold out their sound with this album; just look at the beautiful `A Tout Le Monde' - MTV censored the video because the lyrics were `disturbing' on the suicide theme. Dave Mustaine and Megadeth bow down to no-one on this disc. These irritations I have about peoples perceptions of the post-thrash era Megadeth aside, this is one awesome album. Dave Mustaine's lyrics and his vocal delivery of them throughout the album is awesome and he deals with various `difficult issues' such as incest on `Family Tree' and suicide on `A Tout Le Monde' really well. The riffs are heavy, dark and crunchy throughout the album giving way to some mesmerising musical sequences. The album is no slouch on the solos front either and as is per usual for a Megadeth album, there are lots of them and they all shine.<br /><br />Following Megadeth's re-union in 2004 with the release of 'The System Has Failed', Dave Mustaine personally helped remaster the band's back catalogue. With 'Youthanasia', the remaster is excellent. All of the guitar lines shine through the remaster, the drums are crisp sounding and the bass is ever present. Mustaine's vocals also sound great. The remaster has a demo of the classic `A Tout Le Monde' with slightly different lyrics in the French chorus. Also included is a previously unreleased song called `Millenium Of The Blind' and `New World Order' and a nice instrumental in `Absolution'.<br /><br />A slow, brooding and foreboding riff gets the album going with `Reckoning Day'. A very strong and atmospheric opening track with a great chorus. I like Mustaine's growled and sometimes distorted vocals on this opener. One of the album's finest efforts in `Train Of Consequences' follows, with it's unusual scratchy riffs and clanging basslines. The verses and chorus are effortless and the solos are great. `Addicted To Chaos' is a sludgier and moodier affair with some quite introspective lyrics, again love the chorus; very effective, as is the echoey `Addicted!' vocal exit. The amazing `A Tout Le Monde' is next. The song about suicide is one of Dave Mustaine's finest songwriting moments and the song pans out to be a timeless ballad styled tune, a great change of pace. Freidman's solo is also astounding and the harmony to end the track is excellent. The more poppy but enjoyable `Elysian Fields' is next. The riffs are catchier on this one and less dark and the harmonised chorus makes a great sound. `Killing Road' has a vintage Megadeth opening with the solo guitar riffing and bass/drum interjections. Lyrically truthful abouts it's subject matter, it has more great riffs and fine solos.<br /><br />`Blood Of Heroes' is next up. Another slower and in some ways ghostly sounding song, which is appropriate for it's content again. The song has a sirine opening and catchy riffs. Mustaine's vocals have a slighlty different but good sound to them. The chorus is awesome. After this is another one of the album's gems in `Family Tree'. This is a fantastic track which has some rather disturbing subject matter about...incest. The song has some nice contrasts, ranging from a whispery verse and built to climax in the chorus. `Youthanasia' is a solid title track about the forgotten generations. Mustaine's lyrics carry the song very well and are the centrepiece. The bonecrunching chorus is also very effective. `I Thought I Knew It All' is another solid metal song, not too spectcular but featuring some great guitar work in the chorus (I'll say it again, this album has some really cool choruses right through). `Black Curtains' is on a similar level, a little bit slow and stately nevertheless it generates a gloomy atmospheric for the song, as was probably intended. Then though we come to perhaps one of Megadeth's greatest tracks in `Victory'. This for me is without doubt the finest track on the album and is Megadeth at their very best. Only Dave Mustaine could pen lyrics using song titles from his previous albums, but he does it here in this song to create a song to show he has been a victory over drugs and has survived his excessive addictions, `some crazy shit has happened since the conjuring' indeed. That aside, this song has fantastic riffs and a rip roaring chorus that's a real sing along, not that I personally identify with Mustaine's years of heroin and cocaine usage of course! The song has a great, urgent drive and has a vintage soloing section which is the song's highlight. Mustaine and Freidman trade off 4 magnificent solos.<br /><br />So there we have it, the much underrated IMO `Youthanasia'. Megadeth may have developed and outgrown their earlier thrash roots but they are no way watered down artistically on this album; this album is 50 minutes of kick ass heavy metal with plenty of awesome moments.

B00008DDHZ|5.0|Excellent work.  We took the family to Ireland and Northern Ireland this year and toured Derry.  This movie was such a help for us to understand what happened on Bloody Sunday.  We purchased this item because of hearing about the well received 9/11 movie by the same director.
0060922583|3.0|I bought the book expecting it to give clear links between current scientific theories and the domain of spiritual thought. However, I find that the scientific coverage is sketchy and in the initial chapters - psychological aspects are better covered than the physics. The latter part of the book is devoloped on the twilight theme of attempting to link spiritual experience(s) of various types, into an analytical framework. This attempt may be acceptable only to a person who is in the 'believer' or 'neutral' context, since the science linkage is not too strong.
8478886559|5.0|Like all the other books in the Harry Potter series, this book is well written and entertaining.  While I can't speak about the quality of the translation (I'm not particularly proficient in Spanish yet), this book has proved useful in helping me to learn Spanish due to the fact that it is geared towards a younger audience and thus for the most part has a fairly simple vocabulary.
B00005Y228|1.0|This sound dictates a socially contructed \\"norm\\"......there is so much more out there to experience.....maybe this sound is reflective of a pop culture and society that dwells in thoughtless consumption, capitalist greed, spoilt little teenage brats and the \\"I want more and more\\" attitude.....this middle aged lady is assisting in forcing you all to lead \\"mono\\" thought lives......get over it and get out of your socially constructed lives....Kylie is an unthoughtful, talentless, pseudo accented woman and i feel a little sorry for her.....it would actually be quite sad to look back on your life and realise that you were responsible for something as hideous as this.
B000BTJDGC|2.0|The basic concept and structure of \\"The Exorcism of Emily Rose\\" is sound -- a murder trial for an exorcist, intercut with flashbacks letting the audience see the events first-hand -- but they're buried under a mess of a movie.<br /><br />Strangely, this slapdash movie feels like the sort of original movie aired on Lifetime. If, you know, Lifetime aired stories about demonic possession.<br /><br />In this case, the terrible dialogue, written by someone I can only assume has never actually spoken to an actual person before, almost totally distracts from the wooden acting. What sort of drugs were given to a cast that includes some fairly dependable actors to turn them into listless zombies, I can't guess.<br /><br />Absolutely skippable, especially if, like me, you think the premise and structure sound really intriguing. The reality of the final film just proves all the more frustrating, in that case.
B000HCO83Q|5.0|This movie had great action and special effects. Some people don't agree that this movie was good becuase of it's comic book history. It's your opinion but not a fact. This movie focuses on the characters and their abilities more. The first two movies were boring and not that much action. This one goes over the top. X-men is about action, excitement; this movie shows that. <br />The only reason why some are upset is becuase of the major deaths that was taken place in this movie. I enjoyed it. Watched it seven times in the movies.
B000088E6D|4.0|Great CD. Michael's voice takes you away to a quiet and romantic place.
B00005JOYM|2.0|I saw this movie on opening day, emotionally preparing myself as I did with United 93.  True there WERE many emotional moments, fine acting by the principal players and good choreography.<br /><br />BUT, I was sadly disappointed by the often controversial Oliver Stone's rendering of the events of that fateful day of 9/11/01.  The movie was good but had the feel of a network/cable TV \\"Movie of the Week\\" movie about any of the tragic events that occasionally occur, be it a coalmine collapse, earthquake, flood, etc.  An okay touchy, feely movie but in reality just  entertainment and just barely memorable due to 9/11.  The storyline infact mentioned very little of the scope of the destruction of the World Trade Center.<br /><br />For a true, heartfelt look at courage and heroism in action, try to catch the cable documentary \\"The Miracle of Stairway B\\" on The History Channel showing the real time events of the rescue of 16 survivors trapped in the remanents of the North Tower.<br /><br />IMHO, United 93 is far superior and in a complete league of its own!  For parents with younger viewers, try to catch \\"Tiger Cruise\\", a fine DCOM (Disney Channel Original Movie) of a true life occurrence coinciding with the attack of the WTC.
B000FS9FCQ|4.0|I wouldn't say this is a great movie, but at least it took some chances. The idea of a terrorist as a popular hero, the irony of John Hurt who played Winston in \\"1984\\" playing the dictator, and the further irony of Stephen Rea who played a terrorist in \\"The Crying Game\\" playing the relentless cop who is now hunting a terrorist for the totalitarian regime were all braver ideas than I am accustomed to seeing coming out of Hollywood these days. However, it does seem obvious that the movie is taking swipes at the Bush administration and its supporters, which is not exactly a brave or bold position in Hollywood, or anywhere else for that matter.<br /><br />The acting is commendable. It is good to see Natalie Portman given the chance to take on a more challenging role than she was given in her part in the Star Wars prequels where, along with the rest of the cast, she saw lots of action but had little opportunity to act. Plus, Hugo Weaving had a real challenge to project a personality behind the Halloween mask he wore throughout the film with mere body language and the inflection of his voice. I think it was a challenge that he met admirably.<br /><br />I guess the one thing that really bothered me was the basic premise of the film. Having just read \\"While Europe Slept\\" I find it difficult to believe that the United States would end up self destructing by ever managing to be more politically correct than any country in Europe, including Great Britain. I also find it hard to believe that religious fundamentalism would ever take root in England, since its language and ways would seem foreign to almost the entire citizenry. After all, the entire continent of Europe has been in a post-Christian era for about the last one hundred years. Nobody in Europe would even understand what the dictator was talking about when he delivered one of his religious rants - he might as well be reciting Shakespeare backwards.<br /><br />However, if you can suspend your beliefs as to what is the most likely future of particular western countries, this is a pretty good movie.is the most likely future of particular western countries, this is a pretty good movie.
B00004U28G|5.0|I would say this is the greatest Chuck Norris movie, no wait, the greatest movie of all-time except for one thing.  And that is that all Chuck Norris movies are created equal and better then movies like the Godfather, Schlinder's List, Back Door Sluts 9, and Braveheart combined.  Chuck Norris is a much better actor then Tom Hanks and Marlon Brando because he knows karate.  Hell Chuck Norris invented Karate as well as Judo, Kung Fu, and Hamster style Jap Slapping.  Do yourself a favor and buy this movie so you can call yourself a man.  And if your a woman buy this movie and pray Chuck Norris comes to your house and gets you pregnant. <br /> <br />This message was approved by Chuck Norris. <br />
B000BW7QWW|4.0|When Serenity got pulled after just one short, but wonderful season, I mourned its loss. The characters were well developed and fresh. It was one of the best sci-fi television ventures ever.  When I heard they were making a movie, I was glad, but afraid they would lose the essence of the series.  The movie exceeded my expectations, but some of the human casualties were devastating.  There were some plot discontinuities, but I'll forgive those as being necessary to make a mass market movie for those who hadn't seen the series.  I hope this will not be the end.
B0000026NC|3.0|This is a stadium-rock recording.  That ought to be enough to warn the discriminating listener that this recording is far from perfect.  \\"Another Brick in the Wall\\" is surprisingly weak.  \\"Money\\" sounds plain dumb, especially the backing vocals.  I don't have a clue why they left off \\"Great Gig in the Sky.\\"  \\"On the Turning Away\\" is very nicely done.  \\"One of these Days\\" sounds really good too.  With the exception of Jon Carin on keyboards, the extended band does not have a good enough understanding of the depth of Pink Floyd's music to deliver a convincing Pink Floyd performance.  The drums are too busy, and the bass guitar tone is too bright and not really appropriate for Pink Floyd. The saxophone playing is over-the-top and lacks patience, which is a key component of Floyd's sound.     The truth about Pink Floyd, like most major rock bands, is they sound much better in the studio than they do live.  In fact, they were wizards in the studio, but their big, live stadium rock sound is just not that great, which is one of the reasons Pink Floyd leader Roger Waters decided it was time to leave the band.      If you want a genuine live Pink Floyd album, buy Ummagumma and listen to disc one.  Is There Anybody Out There? is a fair choice for a live Pink Floyd album, since it was a truly legendary concert event (The Wall).  Of course Floyd's incredible video \\"Live at Pompeii\\" is an excellent live recording - without an audience!       \\"Delicate Sound of Thunder\\" has a few good moments, thanks to David Gilmour's exceptional talent with the Stratocaster, but overall this is essentially a pretty boring recording that was overcommercialized and overrated by the mass media. If you really feel you must have it, then definitely get the video, not the CD - the video footage is really excellent, truly wonderful camera-work, and Floyd always put on incredible visual shows at their concerts, so it's much better to watch the performance while you listen than it is to simply listen toit.
B0002YLC24|5.0|So, we continue with the psychosexual primer for guys (How to Get the Girl of Your Dreams in One Easy Step).  I know that women may value this movie, which is natural, but I found an extraordinary number of guys falling for this \\"romance.\\"  I like they, could relate wholly or not at all.  The script may seem boring for Before Sunrise and Before Sunset, but that is only true when you find the concept of being alone with a beautiful woman in an intense one-on-one boring.  This concept may be terrifying to some guys.  Otherwise, you will find the patience to endure the cinematic buildup to the inevitable end: The soul mates converge.<br /><br />Celine: Baby, you are going to miss your plane.<br /><br />Jesse: I know<br /><br />She had been urging him for hours to watch the time.  He would always respond with, \\"I have time.  I will not miss my plane.\\"<br /><br />This is the denouement of both films, Before Sunrise and Before Sunset, for me.  Jesse finally comes to the realization that he must by fate drop everything he had planned and start then and there with Celine, and for more than just one night.<br /><br />Their generation is well know for angst and hyper analytical approaches to life.  At last I, being a baby boomer, can say that I finally understand and appreciate Generation-X, to a small degree.  For the longest time I thought the majority were ultra materialistic snobs with serious entitlement issues.  And more murderous than your average Caesar.  They were/are inversely bitter relative to the amount of things they are given (more things less bitter, less things more bitter).  But they also inherited some heinous social ills from the previous generations.  Anyway, the attitudes of Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke perfectly reflect Gen-X's problems and solutions.<br /><br />I was happy to see that that first night of love endured and nine years later culminated at her apartment fulfilled.  To me, they reunited \\"just in time,\\" and will never part again.
B000001DWG|5.0|Although I still have a greater love of things later (Pearl Jam), MLB are the clear inspiration.  Andrew's lyrics coupled with Stone's riffs and Jeff's bass are what you can only describe as beautiful melodic rock. <br />If you love Jeff Buckley's sense of melody / ultimate beauty, and Freddie's sense of dash then you will love this.  I will always state that I love listening to PJ/Nirvana/Reef/Live/Just Ginger/RHCP/Billy Joel/Radiohead more, but MLB will always somehow find its way to the top of my playlist through sheer quality and beauty of music. <br />Make no mistake, Andy Wood could have made MLB the Led Zep of our time.  Awesome, what a boy: like Jeff and Kurt, let us just be thankful for what there was from him.
B0000033IR|5.0|I have 99% of everything that is available by Aretha Franklin and for me personally, this album is the definitive late 60's Aretha Franklin -- bold, beautiful, vulnerable, earthy, sexy, defiant, spiritual and strong.  All these qualities and quite a bit more are conveyed by that marvelous Voice and piano (via those lovely, delicate fingers).   <br /> <br />My favorite Aretha song ever is here -- Good To Me As I Am To You.  The sheer force of this song not only makes this a testimony of victory over victimization in a relationship, but I've always thought it was one of the sleeper anthems of the civil rights movement, as well.  The lyrics convey this, as do the angst and the \\"I-will-win\\" factor that Aretha always carries within her voice to some degree.  Never did she carry it in the 60's like she did on this album and with this particular song. <br /> <br />The rest of the album is not quite that transcendent for me, but \\"Lady Soul\\" still kicks like few others.  Chain Of Fools is still a haunting tune with an indisputable groove even after hearing it for the 500th time; People Get Ready inspires repeated playbacks; and there are few summer songs better than Aretha's take on Groovin.  <br /> <br />Money Won't Change You and Niki Hoeky are quite fun to listen to because of Aretha's voice, but beyond that they are not essential.  Come Back Baby's vocal is amazing, yet it's all but buried in the mix (what was Atlantic thinking?).   <br /> <br />But when you add the ones that ARE essential -- Natural Woman, Since You've Been Gone, and Ain't No Way -- you have an absolutely classic and indispensable piece of American music history here.   <br /> <br />The one and only Aretha Franklin:  \\"Lady Soul.\\"
0316172324|5.0|I got the idea right away - the first chapter drew me into a ubiquitous phenomenon I never knew existed, and it's been the subject of many a discussion since. I especially loved the chapter on reading emotions because I teach communications and the non-verbal aspect has always fascinated me.
B000FVQYYK|5.0|Absolution was hauntingly beautiful, but Black Holes and Revelations is astounding. At first listen, I was really disappointed, and considered it mediocre. I think that was because when I heard Supermassive Black Hole, I thought it couldn't possibley be Muse. I got used to it after a couple listens, and I really enjoy the Queen-esque lyrics, harmonizing, and almost dance-like beat. <br /> <br />After having listened a few times to this album, I'm addicted. Muse uses a lot more synth in this album, but I think it adds to the atmosphere well. Each song is distinctive and very well done, though Soldier's Poem seems just a little out of place as it's the only really slow song...Knights of Cydonia. Well, its indescribable. If ever there was a song to harken back to the old guitar-driven songs of Muse and combine the instrumental experimentalism of Queen, this is it. <br /> <br />Thematically, as is signature of Muse, they focus on pretty dark topics, though the few moments of hope and joy are just highlighted because of this. <br /> <br />My favorite songs are Starlight, Map of the Problematique, Invincible, Assassin, City of Delusion, and Hoodoo. <br /> <br />Actually, about half the songs on this album give me chills, especially the last stanza of Hoodoo. His voice is definitely the focal point, and he sings it so slowly and remorsefully. Its amazing to listen to Showbiz, Origin of symmetry, Absolution, and BH and R and notice how much the band has changed lyrically and instrumentally, but how astounding they have remained.
B000001FRY|5.0|I am one of the most widespread rock listeners/musicians you will ever find; I like hard rock a la Led Zeppelin, surf rock like the Beach Boys, indie rock like the Boo Radleys, etc.  U2 has been one of my favorite bands of all time and deservedly so.  I have their complete discography and quite a few of their ep's and singles.  \\"Boy\\" was my first U2 cd that I bought, back in 1980.  This is one of their best albums, dealing with the maturity, emotions, responsibility, and sexuality of a young man.  This album helped me grow up.      \\"I Will Follow\\" is the classic early U2.  Edge's guitar sounds mystical and defines his distinctive style in the first few notes.  This is really a classic.  \\"Twilight\\" is tweaked.  I really like Bono's vocals and lyrics.  The bass carries the song with an Adam Clayton trademark bass line, including a short bass solo after the chorus which is interesting.  \\"An Cat Dubh\\" and \\"Into the Heart\\" have to be reviewed together, as they are one two-song segue that I have never forgotten.  \\"Cat\\" sounds spooky with a airplane-like guitar intro.  A great song.  \\"Heart\\" is a beautiful ballad, perhaps one of the beston here even though it is only 1 1/2 minutes long.    The rocker \\"Out of Control\\" opens with a blissful, loose guitar part from the Edge and Bono's vocals/lyrics provide clarity on the song.  \\"Stories For Boys\\" is haunting and melodic, a great song.  \\"The Ocean\\" is alot like \\"Heart\\" in that it is a short, sweet ballad.  \\"A Day Without Me\\" is an anthemic song that would later define U2.  Bono's vocals sound some of the best on here.    \\"Another Time...\\" is the only miss on here.  I find it a little boring but it is still a good song.  Listen for yourself.  \\"The Electric Co.\\" is such a great song with a memorable guitar riff.  Larry Mullen's drums help create the song.  And finally, \\"Shadows And Tall Trees\\", the title a reference to \\"Lord of the Flies\\" by William Golding (a very fine book, pick it up if you have time) and to Dorian Grey.  Theline \\"Mrs. Brown's washing is always the same...\\" is one of my favorites.    So there you have it.  If I had to pick a favorite I would say \\"I Will Follow\\", \\"Out of Control\\", or \\"Shadows And Tall Trees\\".  Pick up this album NOW along with all of U2's early CDs, if not the complete discography.  What an amazing debut!
B00004RHZU|5.0|Simply, I love P!nk!  This debut was one of the best when it dropped in 1999.  Sadly, she has decide to do rock instead, even though I did buy her latest \\"I'm Not Dead Yet\\".  I love the R&B feel that pink's voice gave to \\"Can't Take Me Home\\".  This has to be the only cd out of my collection that I know the lyrics to all the songs on the cd.  Pink, will be around for a while. <br /> <br />My Favorite Tracks in order: <br /> <br />Track 4: There You Go <br />Track 1: Split Personality <br />Track 3: Most Girls <br />Track 8: Private Show <br />Track 5: You Make Me Sick <br />Track 11: Do What You Do <br />Track 7: Love Is Such A crazy Thing <br />Track 12: Hiccup <br />Track 13: Is It Love <br />Track 9: Can't Take Me Home <br /> <br />Track 6 & 10 I don't really care for.
B00005Y6YB|5.0|I'm very bias about this movie for TV. It is my all time favorite.The price was a steal compared to what I paid for the VCR tapes a few years ago. The book and the DVD are excellent.
B000002UA0|5.0|this album fits right in with all those other psych rock bands of the late sixties. it is magneficent. i listen to it between love forever changes and the doors
B000FILW86|3.0|I've had \\"Rockford\\" for about a week now and have given it several listens, and I'm just not hearing the brilliance that is causing other reviewers to compare this CD to Dream Police and other classic Cheap Trick albums.  It's certainly not a bad disc, a little better than the previous album (\\"Special One\\"), but neither of those is as good as the 1997 self-titled album.  And they're definitely not in the same league as the band's early albums. <br /> <br />The album that Rockford reminds me the most of is \\"One on One\\".  It has the same overproduced sound through most of it, and the same aggressive guitars and driving rhythm section.  But then there are other parts of Rockford that remind me of the very different, stripped-down album \\"Next Position Please\\".  I guess that comes from having multiple producers working on Rockford.  But the majority of the album sounds like \\"One on One pt. 2\\" to me. <br /> <br />Speaking of production, I *hate* the production on the song \\"Perfect Stranger\\", particularly the way the drums and cymbals fade in and out with each beat.  Listening to it over headphones almost makes me feel seasick. <br /> <br />Negatives aside though, this is a pretty good Cheap Trick album, and definitely worth picking up if you're a fan of the band.  It's much better than some of their late 80s, early 90s stuff like \\"Busted\\".  The high energy song \\"Come On Come On Come On\\" alone is reason enough to buy the new album - it's become one of my favorite Cheap Trick tracks. <br /> <br />With all the people comparing the song \\"One More\\" to ELO (which I don't quite get), how is it that no one seems to have noticed that the opening of \\"This Time You Got It\\" is a dead ringer for ELO? <br /> <br />Anyway, as a long-time fan of the band who owns all their albums on CD, I'd recommend buying Rockford, but don't get your hopes up too high.  If you go into it expecting another Dream Police, you might be disappointed.  If you expect a better-than-average Cheap Trick album, you'll probably get what you expect. <br />
B0007PAMR4|5.0|Althought the extended scenes and narration in the \\"Alan Smithee\\" version are nice features, but the original theatrical Lynch's version is still the winner. A must have to any scifi collection both versions finally in anamorphic widescreen (the previous release was letterbox).
0743455967|4.0|yeah, sure.  Stephen King has some crappy books.  But mostly he is an accomplished author.  Who wouldn't want to write half as well as he does, especially at his best. <br /> <br />This is King's thoughts and advice on writing.  Little hints to make you a better writer.  Little suggestions to help you overcome writer's block.  King churns the books out now, but he's dealt with writer's block and knows how to deal with it.  The cost is low the advice is good.  Seems like a buy to me.
B0002W4SWC|5.0|I already owned The Edge of Reason, and I actually like the first movie more (if you're into this kind of movie). <br /> <br />Standard Shipping arived in only 2 days!
B00005JOML|1.0|Ok, so I've seen a bunch of folks talking about how there was no chemistry between the main characters - yeah that was a problem, but my biggest problem was there was no tension *anywhere*!<br /><br />After being undercover a grueling two days, Tubbs turns to Crockett and says something to the effect of \\"Can you handle it, or have you been in too long?\\" OH COME ON!!!<br /><br />If Isabella and Jesus have a poly or open relationship - which they certainly seem too, then why would Jesus be so upset to see her dancing with Crockett.  You can't have that both ways.<br /><br />I honestly think they bought the MV title so they didn't have to spend anytime giving us background on the main characters - but they didn't use that extra time to give us any depth.<br /><br />I don't follow directors, I have no idea if this is a typical Mann movie or not - but it's a bad movie, and boring, and I want my $8 back! Sigh

B0009R1T7M|4.0|Great stuff. Different. Half of this album feels like you've stumbled into a grade 6 concert band/choir rehearsal. I'm on my second run through and I'm enjoying it more than the first.

0553573403|5.0|A Game of Thrones by George R.R. Martin is book one in the A Song of Ice and Fire series. I have owned this book for approximately a year before finally reading it. It came with much acclaim but also a fair share of negativity as well, could this not be said about any book though. Some of the major criticisms about this book are the amount of characters, violence, and incest. Are these thins present in this book? Absolutely. Does it detract from the overall story? No. It simply boils down to personal preferences and what each individual likes to read.<br /><br />The plot of this book is actually rather concise and compact. Yes, there are several sub-plots, but the overall plot of this book is pretty straight forward. It has been used in countless fantasy books before this and that is; different people vying to be the King. However, even if you have read this plot hundreds of times, Martin writes it in such a way that it seems not only new, but also ground breaking. The depth of intrigue, betrayal, and tragedy that are present is unlike anything I have read before. If you are thinking of reading this book this is more adult fantasy. Along with the main plot there is also the sub-plot of the Wall. In this book we are introduced to several aspects of the Wall, but as of yet not much happens there. I can easily see that being a setting for future plot twists and big moments. I have heard some say that too much is going on in this book. I don't think that's the case at all. Martin does a very good job at breaking the story up into pieces so the reader can digest everything they are reading. I didn't find myself lost at all.<br /><br />The characters in this book are simply fantastic. Yes there are quite a few characters, but the only difference between this book and many others is Martin develops several characters. This is not the type of book that follows one character through out the entire story. Rather this book is told from several view points of several characters. One thing I appreciated about Martin's style is there are no fluff chapters. If a character has a chapter you can rest assured that something important will be happening in said chapter. The characters in this book are not your prototypical fantasy characters, meaning there are really no good guys and bad guys. Sure, there are characters you will love and characters you will hate. But, their actions don't always follow what the `good guys and bad guys' do. Rest assured as well, Martin has no qualms about killing a character if it will progress the story... and he does this several times. While the plot is well written, this is a character driven book in my opinion.<br /><br />While this is considered a fantasy book there are not many elements of the `classic' fantasy stories, i.e. magic and monsters. However, that seems like it may begin to appear more in later books. Martin has a way with words. Within the first ten pages I was already sucked in by the story and Martin's prose lends itself to easy reading. It has a comfortable flow to it, that allows you to pick up the book at 10 PM and look at the clock and realize it is now 3:30 AM and you must go to bed... but you can finish this one chapter. It's an endless cycle of fighting to put the book down.<br /><br />All in all I really enjoyed this novel. I can easily understand the high praise it has received, yet I can also see why the detractor's didn't like it too. I will say though, violence and sex are part of society and Martin doesn't hide that fact.<br /><br />With all that said I would easily recommend this book to people looking for a serious look at the fantasy genre. If you are looking for a deep, thoughtful, engaging read this is where you need to go. If you are looking for an easy, archetypal book this is not the book for you. I am confident the vast majority of fantasy fans will enjoy and appreciate this book. I know I certainly did and am looking forward to continuing this series.ters.

B000BMSTMS|5.0|It took me a few times to warm up to this CD, then I really loved it.  It's very different than the other ones, but it continually stays in my CD player.
B000002J03|5.0|Led Zeppelin's second album is, in my opinion, virtually the greatest album ever made. Every song is amazing. From the terrificly blues-like Bring It On Home to the super rock anthem Heartbreaker, these are all instant classics. At the time Jimmy was pumping out some of his best riffs ever and that transformed into this album. If you don't believe me, just listen to the scorching solo on Heartbreaker or the insane drumming on Moby Dick. <br />     But unlike some of these other people, it would be idiotic to say that this is Zep's only good album. As far as I'm concerned, all of their first six were masterpieces and the other were still good. Zeppelin didn't make a song in there entire carreer that wasn't pure rock and yet they managed to make hundreds of them. This is a great starter album for someone who's just getting started to know the great band that is Led Zeppelin. <br />     Now don't get me wrong by the title of this review. Back In Black is a great album with some serious classics and a heavy rock beat, but it's also highly overrated. I would say that Led Zeppelin II is better than Back In Black, and that's really saying something.

B00001PE4D|4.0|It is nice to see Sarah Michelle Geller in a not-so-nice, anti-heroine role here. I'm so used to seeing her as \\"Buffy\\".
B000089RVX|5.0|This is the first band with a female lead singer that I have really liked, besides Lacuna Coil.  My fav songs are 'Hello', 'Bring Me to Life', etc.  I'm really looking forward to the new album, whenever that comes out!  Amy Lee has a very beautiful voice.
B000007MVL|4.0|Lionheart is similar to Kate Bush's debut album, The Kick Inside, though she regards her second album as rushed and it contains fewer songs.    'Symphony in blue' is like 'Moving' with the fragility ('You crush the lily in my soul' replaced by sexual assuredness- she can categorise herself as having red or blue moods.    A theme evident in Lionheart more than The Kick Inside, though, is that of film/theatre eg. the loneliness of being on the stage in 'Wow' (listen to Kate whisper 'He just holds his breath'- sublime).     The mysterious and magical 'In search of Peter Pan' follows, which partly seems to be about the sadness of reality not living up to dreams, whilst 'Oh England my lionheart' is a medieval-style lament.     In contrast to this Englishness, but just as mysterious, is 'Kashka from Baghdad' which is bookended with an exquisite beginning and ending and 'Coffee Homeground' which, like 'Kite' on her first album, is a delicious slice of catchy bizarreness. It has a Germanic, waltz-like flavour ('Heads we're dancing' from 'The Sensual World' would return to the German theme) about an arsenic poisioner. It could be superficially treated as camp or comic but I see it as avante garde. The closest equivalents I can think of to her specific type of experimentation are Radiohead during the Kid A/Amnesiac period and Bjork but those artists are operating in a time when you aren't entirely alone if your work seems wilfully strange/ utterly heartfelt.    'Hammer Horror' continues the menacing theatrical feel. It's the kind of 'acceptably bonkers' performance that the British public loved from her in the late 1970s as, as long as they could treat Kate like a bit of whimsical fun, they didn't feel too threatened by her evidently unique genius and powerful insight. The introduction to the song is movingly grand, making it seem like a fitting end to the album.    I left the other three songs out until now just so I could discuss certain themes. 'Don't push your foot on theheartbrake' features an Elton John type chorus and is a 'James and the cold gun'-style rock song but, of course, it has some wonderful quirks such as a bridge featuring Kate playing around with vowels: 'Her heart is out there'.     'Fullhouse' seems relatively ordinary by Kate's standards but there's nothing wrong with it.     In 'In the warm room', Kate sings with seductive weariness. There's a beautiful, knowing inevitability as the piano follows her singing: 'Down you'll go to where the mellow wallows'. This song could melt everyone in a room if she played it live.    The album cover isn't the best ever but, if you want a less intense version of 'The Kick Inside' with a dash more theatrics and fairydust, then 'Lionheart' is a decent addition to a Kate Bush collection. but it is a step sideways, and even perhaps a bit back, from her debut.
B0002OERI0|5.0|I have been listening to Green Day for a while now. I love all of their old stuff, and I love this new album too. They have definetly changed over the years, but they are still the same people still making incredible music. I love them and hope that they keep up the good work for more years to come!
B000005J56|5.0|I watched this documentary on IFC a month ago, and while the credit were running I was on amazon ordering the CD. I have played it almost everyday. This is wonderful, even my 16 year old think its good, after I told im the backgound of the band, he was amazed. This is a must for music lovers.
B00006LI4S|5.0|Whether you're a Pink Floyd fan or a David Gilmore fan, or just a fan of great music, this concert should be on your must have list. It's simply a magnificent display of artistic ability from David Gilmore. From acoustic to electric guitar, from old Pink Floyd songs to new Gilmore tunes, he covers it all masterfully. The supporting band is tight and what a pleasure to actually see a cellist jamming along with David and the band. If you like great music with equally great lyrics, then stop reading this and buy the DVD.
B000G75AE8|5.0|After 1990's classic \\"Seasons In The Abyss,\\" Slayer parted ways with original drummer Dave Lombardo, and then (maybe coincidentally) proceeded to go downhill. 1994's \\"Divine Intervention,\\" 1998's \\"Diabolus In Musica,\\" and 2001's \\"God Hates Us All\\" were all decent enough, but no where near as novel or all around great as their earlier releases, and thus, Slayer lost some fans. Well, Lombardo returned to Slayer's live act a couple of years ago, and the band entered the studio last year with their original lineup for the first time in fifteen years, making some fans have a rekindled hope and high expectations for Slayer's tenth studio recording, \\"Christ Illusion.\\"<br /><br />\\"Christ Illusion\\" isn't a timeless classic like, say, 1986's \\"Reign In Blood,\\" and it in no way reinvents the band or the genre. But it is, hands down, the fastest, most inspired, most powerful, and all around best Slayer release since the aforementioned \\"Seasons In The Abyss.\\" Guitarist Kerry King (who wrote most of the album) could use a few new song ideas, but bare in mind that he has a reputation to live up to, so he can't drift too far from his famous subject matter.<br /><br />The guitar shredding (done by Jeff Hanneman and the above mentioned Kerry King) is, as expected, fantastic. The riffs are smoking, the leads are lightning fast, and the solos are careening. Another area in which \\"CI\\" succeeds is in the vocal department, because frontman Tom Araya has improved his performance. His yelling is still kind of grating at times, but for the most part, Araya sounds more committed, a little more diverse, and all around much more listenable than he did on \\"God Hates Us All.\\"<br /><br />\\"Flesh Storm\\" and \\"Catalyst\\" blow the album's door open, and are about the fastest songs Slayer have written since the umpteen year old \\"War Ensemble.\\" Both of these songs blindside the listener with brutal, blistering, insanely fast, dual guitar leads and two solos. Track three, \\"Eyes Of The Insane,\\" slows down the album's pace significantly for a few tracks, but things pick up again for song number six, \\"Consfearacy,\\" which is another blinding guitar onslaught.<br /><br />\\"Skeleton Christ\\" is backed by punching, cascading riffs and a catchy, rhythmic drum beat, and \\"Catatonic\\" boasts crunchy, churning, lumbering power chords. But the album's best two songs are probably \\"Black Serenade\\" and \\"Cult.\\" The former song effortlessly changes speeds as it segues from thunderous, pounding riffs to buzzsaw leads to wild, off-the-map solos. And the latter, \\"Cult,\\" is another scorcher with stellar, remarkably fast drumming by Lombardo. It's also highlighted by some of Kerry King's most blunt and openly blasphemous lyrics to date (such as \\"Religion is hate/religion is war\\" and \\"I've made my choice...six six six!\\") These lyrics will undoubtedly get tattooed to your brain, whether you want them to or not, after just one listen. And finally, the set closer, \\"Supremist,\\" is also of note because it features the first ever blast beats in a Slayer song.<br /><br />Slayer are probably not going to make another indisputable masterpiece like their discs from the 1980's, but this album shows that they definitely still have some life left. If you gave up on Slayer in the early Nineties, it's doubtful that \\"Christ Illusion\\" will change your mind, but it will surely put a huge smile on every fan's face.ntly for a few tracks, but things pick up again for song number six, \\"Consfearacy,\\" which is another blinding guitar onslaught.    \\"Skeleton Christ\\" is backed by punching, cascading riffs and a catchy, rhythmic drum beat, and \\"Catatonic\\" boasts crunchy, churning, lumbering power chords.

0142403873|5.0|A review of the hardcover edition applies to the softcover as well:   <br />The Gruffalo is a delightfully irreverent story about a mouse and an imaginary monster, sure to please grown-ups as well as children. This is a case where you CAN judge the book by its humorous cover, and you won't be disappointed. Axel Scheffler's brightly colored and too-silly-to-be-really-scary illustrations set the tone for this light-hearted romp through multiple layers of comic irony; and Julia Donaldson's marvelous doggerel perfectly realizes the mouse's sprightly character. <br /> <br />It's much more than great fun, though. The Gruffalo also has tremendous resonance with familiar elements of Western culture. This is a story that Carl Jung, Mircea Eliade, and Joseph Campbell all could love. It's a perfect little Hero's Journey: it's got \\"the deep dark wood,\\" a confrontation with the Monster Within, and a victorious return to the ordinary world where a nut is good. Had this been a fable of Aesop, we could expect our hero to be eaten right in the middle, and we would be left with some such lesson as \\"Don't be too clever for your own good.\\" Instead, our mythical mouse makes his Eternal Return bearing a subtle wisdom that echoes the teachings of the world's greatest mystics. <br /> <br />The very structure of the story is classic, reminiscent of the great repetitive folk tales, such as \\"The Three Billy Goats Gruff,\\" \\"The Three Little Pigs,\\" or \\"The Little Red Hen.\\" The mouse's encounter with a dangerous predator is repeated with slight variation in the wording three times (yes, three times, as in three crows of a cock, three days in the belly of the fish, three temptations under a bo tree...) then, after a dramatic climax, the story works its way back with another set of three variations as the mouse retraces his steps on the path toward the real climax. <br /> <br />The Gruffalo's greatest fun for grown-ups comes from its heaps of irony. First, there's the expectation of an Aesopian fable. That expectation is thwarted by the clever mouse. Second are the characters of the animals: they're all wrong. The mouse is not meek and fearful; he's bold and confident, a real smart-aleck, in fact. Then the fierce predators turn out to be wimps. Not only that, these are the exact animals that always represent intelligence in Western folk literature -- the clever fox -- the wise owl -- the subtle snake. Here they are all outwitted by the littlest of animals. Third is the basic irony of the mouse's meeting with the gruffalo -- maybe the mouse is not so clever, after all. Fourth, the terrible monster...! Fifth, he went through all that for a nut. Sixth, that story was a profoundly archetypal tale in goofy rhyme, with cartoon pictures. Seventh, I actually wrote this review, and you actually read it. What's next? Am I going to tell you that Harvey Potter's Balloon Farm is a model for education reform? (well . . . yes!)  <br /> <br />Finally, The Gruffalo really is a fun and loveable book. One of the best for sharing with your kids.
B000GIXEIG|5.0|I saw Beowulf & Grendel in LA.  It was fantastic!!!!  I love Medieval adventure films and they just don't make enough of them.  Sturla Gunnarsson and Andrew Berzins have given us a real treat here.  The humor in this adaptation was a real added plus for me and I love the twist it gave to this age old tale.  Iceland was beautiful, breath taking to say the least. The acting was superb with strong  delivery by all including the weather which played havick with the filming of B&G which we will be able to see in the documentary about the making of this film, The Wrath of Gods. The extras on the DVD will have scenes from this documentary as well.  I have pre ordered my DVD of B&G and I will have to have one of the Wrath of Gods when it becomes available too.  They will both be favorites to add to my collection. <br />***I highly recommend this movie!!!!!
B000301YY8|5.0|All of the songs on Back to Bedlam showcase James Blunt's signature voice, which is emotionally moving.  His sound is comparable to that of Damien Rice.
0684867621|3.0|The idea of a little girl (who is big for her age) lost in the wilderness is absolutely terrifying.  It's a rare bird when that situation turns out good.  When King tackles the subject matter you expect good things.  Unfortunately, that's all you get -- good things.  Good.  Not great.<br /><br />Personally, King's best have been \\"The Shining,\\" \\"Christine\\" and \\"Salem's Lot.\\"  This book takes a real-life type horror and puts you in the middle of it.  You aren't quite sure of the girl's fate, though you get the idea she'll make it out alive.<br /><br />Supernatural elements aren't really there, and that's a good thing.  With a story that has the potential to be utterly horrifying on its own, you don't want to dress it up with ghosts, werewolves, serial killers or motivated vegetation.  You want the real-life horror of the situation to draw readers in and make them hold their breath.  So with all the good aspects, why does this book fail to live up to its potential?<br /><br />I think King, the author who made me want to be a writer, pulled back.  I think he grew to like his main character too much.  The horrors of the world visited her, but they didn't stay.  They also didn't make much of an impression.  While reading this, it wasn't the girl's situation that horrified me, it was the fear that this could happen to my child.  Instead of being concerned with King's protagonist, I cared about my own flesh and blood.<br /><br />Again, it's not his best work, but it also isn't his worst.  It makes for a sometimes tense afternoon read ... especially if you live on the East Coast where you get those wonderful afternoon thunderstorms that let you know God can still wipe you out with but a thought.
0307263118|4.0|The most poignant memories are beautiful and bare, believable and dreamlike.  It is these sort of memories, the ones which lead one into a lasting trance where real and conscious are subjective terms, that create Banville's potent novel, the 2005 winner of the prestigious Man Booker Prize for Fiction.  Max, the narrator, is an art historian grieving the loss of his wife to illness while retreating at the coastal village of his childhood summers and his first tastes of love.  The town leads Max through his remembrances to the Graces, the family which he met one summer and subsequently attached himself to first for his love for the mother and later for the daughter Chloe, to his wife Anna whom he is still trying to figure out how to live without, to his self both as a child and now as a middle-aged man although the two may not be that different.  Banville displays an artisanship for stream-of-consciousness; each sentence is meticulously poetic and leads fluidly into the next thought or recollection or smell.  The smells in particular are hauntingly detailed and as tangible as the characters; Chloe's prepubescent odor is \\"fawnish...like that which comes out of, which used to come out of, empty biscuit tins in shops.\\"  Max does not struggle but simply understands the things that have happen to him and everyone.  He remembers his childhood and his wife by allowing memory its own course and trusting its steadfastness, memory which moves like the sea.
B00004Z4SD|5.0|This movie came recommended to be by someone who in my opinion wouldn't have had the brains to appreciate it! I'm grateful to him for turning me on to one of the most perfect little gems of a movie to come along in years. I rank it right up there with THE STATION AGENT, another quiet, small picture with very little plot and oh, so much heart and soul! If you like a film that takes its own sweet time to unfold, letting you come along for the ride, then get this one. If you're looking for car chases and gunfire and special effects and all those other big-box-office necessities, then stay away and leave this for those of us who value beauty.

Kietel is one of the great underappreciated actors of his generation. while deniro and others (all equally deserving) got accolades, Kietel has never gotten his due.
038533348X|5.0|I don't know whether to categorize the book as political, adventurous, anti-religious, satirical or philosophical (perhaps all). This being my first Vonnegut novel, I can say with personal conviction, that I am a staunch Bokononist. The journey of Cat's Cradle is one of absurdities, cliches, wisdom, luck and chance. What I find intriguing is how Vonnegut manages to balance the seriousness of the atomic bombing of Japan, and the foolish life of a scientist, who helped create it. I do like the characters and feel they all have their moment of catharsis. Somehow they all feel relevant to the story, yet John(the main character) never seems dull.
B0009X7664|5.0|This is a great movie. I read the book in seventh grade and I love this movie. I can't belive that in some places in the USA, \\" To Kill A Mockingbird\\" is banned. It's about justice and the injusitice of a ceritan race. I reccomend this movie to everyone.
B000E5KJFM|1.0|This movie is listed as a thriller on Netflix, but there is nothing thrilling about it.  It is very slow paced, particularly since it is only 126 minutes long-it felt much longer than that (like Lord of the Rings long).  It is also hard to follow because it jumps all over the place and the cast seems to be in the hundreds.    George Clooney plays the stereotypical amoral CIA agent who becomes disillusioned with his work.  Matt Damon plays the fast talking energy trader with starry-eyed dreams of reforming the Middle East.  Then there are the cartoonish Texas oil men, US politicians, CIA types, Arabs, and Chinese.  This movie is just more conspiracy theory junk about how the American government and oil industry is bad and the Arabs are helpless, good people that are being exploited.  I couldn't wait for it to end-not even worth renting.
0743219619|3.0|Adam Dalgleish is back in this well written, though ultimately depressing and bleak thriller.  Recuperating from a near-death illness, Adam is summoned to a small village by an old friend, a priest named Father Michael.  However, when he gets there, his old friend has died of a heart attack, and Adam finds himself involved with a hospice for the young disabled, i.e., terminally ill patients.  James serves up a host of pathetic, sad creatures and as usual, a cast of mostly unlikeable characters.  Dalgliesh serves more as an observer than a detective, since he is having his own crisis of whether to retire or not, but he nonetheless manages to investigate a series of deaths that may or may not be murder.<br /><br />James continues her mastery of atmospheric tension and the culprit's identity is expertly hidden until the end.
B000002J0P|5.0|A must have for late 60's, early 70's soft rock fans. The remastered version is terrific. I forgot how great this album is..........A Classic!!
B0001MIQLW|5.0|this movie and the stellar performances within did not get the recognition it deserved. this movie succeeds where many \\"literary\\" movies failed. <br /> <br />i won't go into the plot details, but suffice to say the movie delves into the lives of several new yorkers -- all down on their luck -- who are brought together by a troubled kid and smoking. keitel, hurt and forrest are brilliant. the script & dialogue are thought-provoking and moving. Go see it!
B000G75AE8|5.0|Before I review this album, I first of all have to say that Slayer are without a shadow of a doubt, one of the greatest thrash metal bands of all time. They are also one of my all time favorite metal bands, and I just can't praise them enough. I even had the privilege and pleasure of seeing Slayer on the Unholy Alliance Tour along with Lamb of God, Children of Bodom, Mastodon, and Thine Eyes Bleed in St.Paul, Minnesota on July 8th last month. It was my first time seeing Slayer live in concert, and it was one of the best shows I've been to, and I sure can't wait to see them again sometime in the near future.<br /><br />Anyways onto the album, Slayer have finally returned triumphantly with a furious vengeance with their long awaited new album \\"Christ Illusion\\", their first album in five long years since 2001's \\"God Hates Us All\\". I bought this album yesterday at my local Sam Goody store in Rice Lake, and when I first popped it in my cd player, I was immediately blown away, and I haven't stopped listening to it since. This album is also the first Slayer album with original drummer Dave Lombardo since 1990's \\"Seasons in the Abyss\\" as well. Slayer have proven after more than 20 years that they are more darker, faster, heavier, and agrier than ever before and this album if 100% proof. \\"Christ Illusion\\" to me sounds like \\"Reign in Blood\\", \\"South of Heaven\\", \\"Seasons in the Abyss\\", and \\"God Hates Us All\\" all combined on one monster of an album. This album has everything that every Slayer fan can ask for: Angry vocals, lightning fast guitar riffs, fast wild relentless solos, fast and furious drumming, need I say more? The lyrics throughout on this album deal with religion, war, and the government, what else would you expect from these guys? Singer/Bassist Tom Araya's vocals are as fierce and angrier than ever before. Guitarists Kerry King and Jeff Hanneman let off a barrage of lightning fast riffs and relentless trail blazing solos that'll make every emo band duck for cover, and last but certainly not least, Dave Lombardo's double bass drumming is absolutely fast, sick, relentless, and all out powerful throughout. The opening track \\"Flesh Storm\\" is pure bliss. It quickly kicks the album off with a serious bang, and before you know it, you are definately in for some serious, in your face, no nonsense headbanging throughout. Probably the darkest song on the whole album is track five \\"Jihad\\". Lyrically this song is all about the World Trade Center attacks on 9/11 from the terrorists' point of view. Other favorite songs on here include \\"Cult\\", \\"Eyes of the Insane\\", \\"Catalyst\\", \\"Skeleton Christ\\", \\"Black Serenade\\", and \\"Supremist\\". Hell every song on here is a high fiver. BTW: To all the 1 star reviewers saying that this is nu-metal or that every song on here sounds the same, you people really need to look in the mirror, because the way I see it, you're all missing a point. So anyways if you're looking for a straight up no gimmicks, no nonsense, take no prisoners, balls to the wall thrash metal assault, you have definately come to the right and I do mean RIGHT place with \\"Christ Illusion\\". This album to me has Metal Album of 2006 written all over it. Don't get me wrong there are plenty of great new metal albums out this year, but this album however gets my pick for metal album of the year, and it's already in one of my top 5 favorite albums this year. Bottom Line: Great comeback album. Highly recommended for all you Slayer freaks out there. So I just got four words for you: BUY THIS ALBUM NOW!! LONG LIVE SLAYER!! STAY METAL!!<br /><br />Jeremy's song ratings:<br /><br />1. Flesh Storm - 5/5<br /><br />2. Catalyst - 5/5<br /><br />3. Skeleton Christ - 5/5<br /><br />4. Eyes of the Insane - 5/5<br /><br />5.

B000E5KJGQ|3.0|This isn't actually a review of the movie, this is just a response to another person's review. He was having problems with the disc, but it is not the disc's fault, nor is it an overuse of copyrigt protection. This is an HD-DVD, a completely new format put out by Toshiba to compete with Sony's Blu-Ray. It uses a completely different laser, code, and encryption than original DVDs. It WILL NOT work in current DVD players, you must purchase a new player that can read these discs. An expansion for the XBox 360 will be put out later so that it will read HD DVDs, but that will not be released until later. As with the Blu-Ray technology, the players will probably pretty expensive, so if you want to watch this on an HD DVD, be prepared to fork over some big bucks.
B000301YY8|1.0|I  purchased 'Back to Bedlam' after reading that James Blunt was being hailed as the male Tori Amos. Being a Toriphile I was intrigued and very excited to hear this album. What a disappointment! I tried. I listenned to this album at least 10 times and just cant stand it. Sure its up close and personal but its uninspired and lackluster. Its like listening to bad, adolescent poetry set to elevator music! \\"You're beautiful\\" makes me want to hit myself in the head with a hammer til I'm dead. No wonder Weird Al Yankovic did a parody called \\"You're pitiful\\",(available for download on his website). 'Beautiful' could very easily have come directly from a love-note passed in middle school algebra class. Lets hope Mr. Blunt stays off the subway and to all the women in the world, PLEASE AVOID DIRECT EYE CONTACT WITH JAMES BLUNT! I gave the CD to my secretary because she expressed an interest. She hates it too!
0143036556|2.0|In Guns, Germs, and Steel, Diamond as Yalu poses the question, \\"why do some societies succeed better than others.\\"  The rest of the book is a compelling attempt to answer that question. <br /> <br />In the followup, \\"Collapse\\" Diamond asks the question why do some fail.  To the extent that he stays on that topic, the book succeeds.  Like GG&S, it's popularized research.  Not up to the level of something you would find in a purely academic publication, and some of his assumptions don't match the latest research, but as with GG&S Diamonds critics overstate the importance of those mistakes to his thesis.  When he is talking about easter island, the pueblo peoples, and greenland, this is a good (not great) book. <br /> <br />Unfortunately the other two thirds of the book are a preachy sophomoric mess.  Trying to talk about the sustainability of modern industrialized society without really mentioning energy and oil production, and giving only the most trivial (and demonstrably wrong) discussion about the role of technology is talking about the cockroaches while the 800 pound gorillas play pinochle.  Also, by focusing on the problems and insisting on some platonic ideal of sustainability, his assumptions about the problems actually argue for solutions that he is very unlikely to favor.  By insisting that the game is zero sum, Diamond actually legitimizes the short term selfish behavior that one assumes he is trying to fight.
B000002UAR|5.0|A recent story @ the making of album reminded me of the great minds that created it.  The originality and depth make this a must buy album for all serious music lovers.

I wound up reading all the books in the series and ended up loving them all and wishing there were more. This guy can really write and tell a story. What a gifted man. Great Vet and Writer. I must read for all. You will laugh out loud and at times shed a tear. This is great stuff. You cant go wrong.
B000063DI8|4.0|I listened to this album for the first time in quite a while just today.  I think the album's bad reputation was getting to me, as it proved a lot better than I remembered.  It's still certainly one of IM's weaker albums, but it's quite a bit of fun too.  Not their most sophisticated album, that's for sure, but still an enjoyable listen, definitely.<br /><br />'No Prayer for the Dying' comes directly after 'Seventh Son...', one of their most ambitious albums, and they seem to have decided to tone things down a bit and make a more straight ahead metal album.  It's also their first w/o Adrian Smith, which is a big loss since I've always thought him better than Murray, but Gers is a solid enough replacement.  Still, though they've toned down the proggy elements and the general theatricality a bit, this is still totally in the classic Maiden style, even if it isn't as well written as those earlier albums.<br /><br />The album opens with 'Tailgunner', a standard IM speed metal opener.  It's one of their weaker tracks of this sort, but it's not bad by any means.  It doesn't grab you the way it might, but it rocks pretty hard, still.  'Holy Smoke' is a controversial one, but I like it.  It's a bit silly, like lotsa stuff here, but still fun. (This is pretty much my position on 'Bring Your Daughter.... as well.)  I think the title track is really quite underrated.  It's a low-key, largely instrumental kinda track, and has just got lotsa cool guitar melodies and atmosphere and whatnot.  The idiotically titled 'Public Enema Number One' and 'Fates Warning' are more textbook IM, with nice crunching riffs and an effectively epic chorus and more solid vocals from Dickinson.  Again, these songs aren't Maiden classics, by any means, but they're very solid songs nevertheless. (Furthermore, cram them in the middle of 'Powerslave', 'Number of the Beast' or 'Piece of Mind' and I think they'd fit fine and not hurt the albums at all even if they wouldn't, again, be standout tracks.)<br /><br />The second half of the album is where it really falls apart for most listeners, I'm sure, and I can understand why even if I don't agree.  Tracks 6-9 are each noticeably flawed, with frequently silly lyrics and trying-too-hard choruses.  I know these songs have problems and yet, for some uncertain reason, they still work for me.  I particularly like 'The Assassin', which is quite good apart from the hopelessly ill-conceived 'Better Watch Out' junk during the chorus.  (And this line, which is annoying initially, somehow manages to become charming on repeated listens.  Or, it did for me anyway.)  The only wholly unsuccesful song on the album, in my view, is the closer 'Mother Russia'.  This song is just boring.  Nothing of interest in it at all.<br /><br />Ehh, nothing else to say.  I like it, anyway.  Try and separate 'No Prayer For the Dying' from its reputation and take it all a bit less seriously and maybe you'll enjoy it  more than most people, as I do.  Or maybe I'm just crazy.  Who knows?<br /> <br />The second half of the album is where it really falls apart for most listeners, I'm sure, and I can understand why even if I don't agree.

1844137864|5.0|Banksy is an amazing artist, a lot of conceptual as well as visually appealing works. I knew that he is like a god father of stencil graffiti, but i never thought good he is with installations.<br /><br />One of my friends spent a year in England, she couldn't even tell me what kind of feeling you get when you see on of Banksy's pieces on the wall!<br /><br />It's good, that besides pictures, you can find his text in this book, not much but very sharp and witty.
B00005JKEZ|5.0|I have seen this film more often than any other single film in my life.  Is it the Absolute Best Film Of All Time?  Probably not, yet this is one of the best pure Hero Films that ever graced the screen.  Errol Flynn simply is Robin Hood (in this very clean-cut vision); Olivia deHaviland, who I crushed on terribly as a young lad, is the perfect Maid Marion; Rathbone & Raines are perfect smooth villains, at times even admirable, yet ultimately dispicible.  Yes, it is a very much Good Guys Versus Bad Guys And The Bad Guys Are Bound To Lose in its formula, but that is what we want in a film like this -- absolutes, with snappy action, clever dialogue, some good fencing scenes, bright colours, and a wonderful Happy Ending. <br /> <br />Most of the extras for this two disc set are also quite wonderful -- the cartoons that play off the movie, the sea voyage, the archery short, etc.  The one place I can fault the collection is the Night At The Movies segment.  Why?  Because it is a combination of incomplete and atypical.  Instead of getting a full newsreel, as would have been both appropriate and easy to obtain, we are given a couple of quick spots of questionable nature -- a full newreel, warts and all, would have served better as a documentary of the true period of the film.  The music short is fine enough, both mildly comic and toe-tapping.  The cartoon segment, however, is amazingly atypical for the era.  Come on!  This is Warner Brothers!  We have other types of cartoons that would have been more \\"mainstream\\" for the period (both musically and in general tone) that would have been much more appropriate for such a film.  Why do we get this song-toon?  Becuase the tune is more \\"accessible\\" to the modern ear?  That will be a passing phase.  Give us what the purports to be -- a real glimpse of the films own time! <br /> <br />Still, let me say that this minor shortcoming in no way affects the overall quality of the product.  The colours of the film are clear and bright, thesoundtrack bell-like, and you will love the package.  Huzzah!
B000HCO83Q|2.0|(spoilers....) The X-Men Last Stand, the Phoenix saga on the big screen...  something a fan of the early Chris Claremont / John Byrne comic books have dreamed about but then it came out. I understand that things change for a movie, they have to make the transition to the big screen but this movie took a meat cleaver to the canon of X-men. The first two movies understood how to make a movie and appease fans of the comic.  Singer was obviously a fan of the original material.  Those earlier movies made some characters that were adults, adolescents; they switch things around but it still rung true.  This movie, however, trounced what had made the original great.   Where Cyclops was a main player in the comic he was cast aside, too insignificant to even show his death.  Where the Phoenix was a messed up girl who struggled with her remaining humanity was instead portrayed as a zombie who would just as soon disintegrate you as look at you.    Angel one of the original X-Men a throw away, the addition of Kitty Pryde was never explained, she just appeared, and so much more. <br /> <br />True there were some great special effects, and Magneto had a few moments but the lack of love of the project was obvious.  Notice in the Golden Gate bridge scene that started out in the day then suddenly it was night...  or how quickly everyone got over a character's death.  This was a HACK job and I wish we could have a do over since I had been a fan of the early story and now I am left with my favorite character's in a shambles.  They killed charaters off maybe due to actors contract rather then if they should die.    <br /> <br />For those of you who do not read the comics, or care about the inner details of the story I am sure this is a fine movie.  But do yourself a favor and pick up the complete Phoenix Saga at a comic book store and see what you were missing. <br />

B000G75AE8|4.0|You'd think, this being a new Slayer album and the first with the classic lineup in 15 years, that it would warrant a lot of discussion.  Turns out it doesn't.  Yeah, it's a real thrash album and yeah, it's pretty good.  It particularly reminds of 'Divine Intervention' in that it is a very middling kind of album, with no truly great tracks.  They're almost all at least pretty decent, though, so it's still plenty worth while even if nothing here really blows you away.<br /><br />The production on 'Christ Illusion' is first-rate.  Frankly, I could stand for the vocals to be slightly, slightly quieter and the guitars a bit louder, but other than that it's excellent.  I particularly love the drum sound they've got here.  Guitar tone, however, is something of a concern.  They're still a bit more down-tuned than you'd usually here on a thrash album, C sharp, I think, and have a very flat and rather thin sound.  Now, I actually kinda like the tone itself, but I think it hurts the songs subtly by cutting down on the contrast between the different riffs.  Normally, one of the keys to thrash songwriting is the transition between speedy, thinner riffs and slower, more crunch intensive riffs.  With this kinda guitar tone, though, it's impossible to make a riff that really thick and crunchy.  So, getting to it, the guitar tone just makes the album sound kinda monotonous, more monotonous than the older Slayer albums, and more monotonous than the decently varied riffage *should* sound.  Also, the solos are indeed back, but I could care less.  They don't bother me, but damned if a single one of them made the slightest impression on me.  They're just kinda there.<br /><br />The album opens well with 'Flesh Storm', the best song on the cd.  This song is an obvious attempt to recall prior opening classics like 'Angel of Death' and 'War Ensemble', which it does, even if it isn't as effective as either of those tracks.  This is very standard Slayer stuff, with ultra-fast alt-picked riffs giving way to stomping half-time riffwork peppered with weird, atonal licks.  Standard stuff, yes, but very well-done.  'Catalyst' is pretty much the same thing but a little shorter and not quite as good.  Then we've got 'Skeleton Christ', another standout.  The main simple, slow, mostly one note main riff that dominates the verses of the song is a bit weak in and of itself, but it segues beautifully into the much faster, much better chorus riff.  'Eyes of the Insane' is the first relative misstep, though it's not a bad song.  It's an atmospheric, midpaced kinda track, with some great drumming.  Sadly, it just never really comes to anything, and even after about 8 listens on my part it still hasn't really made much of an impression.  The album gets back on track with 'Jihad', though, perhaps the most distinctive track on the album.  It's got some really bizarre riffing at times, unlike just about anything else of theirs that I can think of it.  It's a really good track, but it seems a little underwritten.  What's there is good, but it seems like a few pieces are missing.<br /><br />The second half of the album is decidedly weaker than the first half.  It's consistently competent, but never remarkable.  'Consfearacy' is a soild, all-out speed track, but nothing more than that, and not nearly as effective as the 2 openers.  (And that title? Gimme a break, Kerry.  What, did you call Gary Holt to help you write pun-lyrics as forced and lame as his?)  'Catatonic' and 'Black Serenade' are both fairly solid songs, but they really shouldn't have been placed next to one another.  They're very much the same stylistically, combining vaguely groovy, mid-paced late 90's Slayer kinda riffwork with some straight up thrashing, so they kinda blend together.  I found them pretty dull the first couple time through, but they've grown on me quite a bit.  'Cult' is an okay track, but another kinda undistinguished one.  Here the guitar/vox balance comes kinda out of whack, with the vocals totally overpowering everything else, and the lengthy intro is just a bit dull.  Still, it manages to be kinda catchy in spite of the mind-bogglingly inane lyrics.  (Yeah, Slayer never wrote *good* lyrics, I know, but this is just embarrassing.  Fortunately, nothing else on this album comes even close to being this bad, though it's got more than a few truly cringe-inducing moments.)  The album closes with 'Supremist', the most interesting song on the second half of the album.  It's got some nice, relatively melodic and vaguely black metalish riffing combined with some nice drumming from Lombardo.  It also comes to a cool, ultra-heavy ending.<br /><br />Anyway, `Christ Illusion' is a good, if finally not particularly remarkable album.  It's better than the last couple, though, and a lot more along the lines of the your classic Slayer material.  So it's a good sign, anyway.everything else, and the lengthy intro is just a bit dull.

B000089RVX|5.0|Amazing cd from beginning to end I don't give a crap about the idiots whining about mainstream rock, there's nothing wrong with most rock music period I don't care if it's on the radio or not if it's 30 years old or brand new rock has always and still is very good. Ok that out of the way this debut cd is amazing! I doubt Open Door will be any better but this one cd makes these guys almost legendary right away! I don't see how anyone can hate this band.

B00005A0N5|5.0|I could never give any Nightwish album less than a perfect five stars. This was an awesome cd by them. I love every track on here, and listen to it constantly. I am glad to have it in my collection. I love the concept of opera singing being incorporated into metal. They are one of the most talented bands I've ever heard.
B00005OAIE|5.0|I first heard John Mayer on The-N (a TV channel) when I was watching his Bigger Than My Body video. I loved the video and I loved the song. A few months after, for my birthday, I got this CD and went up to my room to listen to the whole thing over and over and over again. That's what I usually do, :D. My favorite song on this album is definitley No Such Thing. I can play the intro on my guitar and I've heard the song on Wisconsin's radio stations ALL THE TIME. I really like this CD better than Heavier Things, even though I love that album too. I feel good when I listen to the songs on this album and it makes me feel younger :D and the songs make me happy!!! 8/5 stars!!! Great album, one of my favorites. I recommend this album to any soft/alternative rock fans!
B0006B2A2E|5.0|Eternal Sunshine proves that there can still be originality in Today's Hollywood. Charlie Kaufman conquers the very difficult task of weaving an intricate, touching tale about the complexities of love and how, in a moment of anger or heartache, we can take for granted our most precious memories and destroy the very best things experienced in life. <br />Michel Gondry and his team saw to it that every trick of the lens, every visually stunning moment worked to enchance the heart of the story and therefore deserves every one of the five stars celebrating their celuloid triumph. Same goes for the actors, who do such a beautiful job with their performances, you'd never know their characters came from words on a page. Jim Carrey deserves special attention as his performance was an understated tour de force, in my opinion - as was Kate Winslet's, and the unlikely pairing making the story all the more surprising and enjoyable. I recommend this be a film in everybody's personal film library - the message is universal and a story as well executed as this one will live on for generations, never growing outdated or stale.
B000AP04FG|5.0|Mr. & Mrs. Smith is Fight Club if Edward Norton were really, really, really sexy, and female. No, seriously. Some of the shots I recognized as being set up exactly like Fight Club. Like Angelina Jolie brushes her teeth as Brad Pitt examines his fingernails in the bathroom? And they talk? Uh-huh. There was definitely joke running through the entire film, as at one point, one of the characters wears a Fight Club t-shirt. <br /> <br />But anyways-- Fight Club minus philosophy, plus fights, about triple the laughs, and absolutely no mindblowing cult ending. And more guns. Many, many, many more guns.  <br /> <br />So, I guess-- not really like Fight Club at all. A gorgeous, romantic, scathingly witty, deadpan, feel-good, action (big gun AND hand to hand) spy thriller.  <br /> <br />Just how did they manage this? <br /> <br />I have no idea. <br /> <br />A must-see.

0393327655|5.0|This book resonated with me deeply, as I place organized religion at the forefront with most of what is insane with this world.Thousands of years of unrelenting bloodletting is the legacy of faith and the Crusades are happening all over again.  <br />If we do not get a handle on the religious/political wars we are all doomed. This is a must read for any intelligent seeker of truth.
0790733226|3.0|Jody Foster is a wonderful actress and in the film she shines. Too bad there weren't some other actors in the film that could arise to her level of excellence. Her character is a person of intelligence, sensitivity, imagination......What was she doing hanging out with the ex-priest...Matthew what's his name. His character is a person of no substance...very surfacey kind of guy.  Jody's character is a mature human being; Matthew plays an angst ridden teenager.<br /><br />  Little too much of 2001: A Space Odyssey for my taste.
B000024D4R|5.0|funny how all these new \\"rock\\" bands get access to all the fanciest, most ridiculously expensive equipment, yet their sound can't come close to this baby, recorded 30 YEARS AGO!!!  to put that into perspective, think about what a video game was 30 years ago...  pong? <br /> <br />anyway, this album is based on the notion that there are three different kinds of people in the world - the dogs, the pigs, and the sheep.  first song is a short acoustic roger waters song about how the only way he can survive this world is by having his lover, because the world is so terrible.  the second song is a 15 minute rock masterpiece that manages to stay more interesting than any song of its length i've ever heard (no, i don't care for \\"echoes\\").  it's a song about the \\"dogs\\" of the world - a man who grows up taking advantage of everyone, then ends up \\"dying of cancer\\" and \\"all alone.\\"  the interesting thing is, roger waters compared HIMSELF to the \\"dogs\\" in an interview, meaning this song is really a bitter, pessimistic view of his own place in the world.  \\"pigs (three different ones)\\" is a song about self-righteous hypocrites and how they're worthless.  you think linkin park is bitter?!?!?!  then i will MAKE you listen to this one.  the bitterness seeps through in every note, every syllable.    while roger waters details the greed, filthiness and hypocrisy of the \\"pigs,\\" david gilmour is totally wailing on his electric guitar with a \\"bitter\\" sound.  richard wright plays a scary-sounding organ throughout.  what's that you say, hard rocking music can't have an organ?  you've just been proven wrong!  awesome.  then the final full-length song - \\"sheep.\\"    the lyrics are told in a story-book form about the stupid sheep who are too dumb and lazy to realize that the end is coming.  the dogs and the pigs are going to destroy them, but they're content.  they don't really care.  gee, kind of sounds like 2006 in america....   hmm, so this album not only SOUNDS good after 30 years, the message is still HIGHLY relevant.  after this, the album closes with pigs on the wing part 2, a song with the same music as part 1, but with the lyrics referring to the extreme bitterness roger waters just pounded into your head over the last 45 minutes or so.  he calmly explains how he's glad he's got his lover around, or all this evil in the world would kinda get to him!  this is the kind of thing only great musicians can pull off  - understating a point to make it have even more power than if they over-emoted like these ridiculous \\"emo\\" bands around today.  <br /> <br />this album's a great opportunity to hear something different from pink floyd.  the band went into the studio without an idea of what kind of album to write, so they thought of something completely different for them.  while gilmour's guitar solos during pink floyd minus roger waters (and his solo albums) tend to be dreamy affairs, here he manages to eke waters's bitterness out into the guitar.  in that way, you might compare this to \\"the holy bible\\" by the manic street preachers, where the guitar player/singer wrote none of the lyrics, yet captured the mood of the lyrics perfectly on guitar.  that pink floyd managed to record a hard-edged album this good, and also a laid-back \\"stoner\\" album as good as \\"dark side of the moon\\" is a testament to their greatness.  :)
0393327655|5.0|Devestating arguments that will give you something to say in a political conversation. If you're religious, you probably won't like it, as it's pretty harsh on everything religious. I thoroughly enjoyed it, except for all the spirituality hookam at the end.
B000E8N690|5.0|Reese Witherspoon & Joaquim Phoenix did a splendid job of reconstructing the music and lives of stars June Carter & Johnny Cash.  This movie brought home the fact that they along with Elvis, Jerry Lee Lewis, Ray Orbison and others were the first big 'rock stars' and all toured the country together...  <br /> <br />I would like to see more on the life of this famous couple and hope the stars along with the dirctor can be persuaded to continue the story!

B00005ASHM|4.0|i kind of have to laugh at the \\"best album of all time\\" discussion.  i have my own albums that i consider the best of all time, and they were all made within the last 15 years.  but that's not the point.  the point is, is the music great or not?  and i think it is.     granted, this album does have some SONGS that you could reasonably call some of the greatest ever (wouldn't it be nice, god only knows, i just wasn't made for these times).  the other songs aren't as strong, but they're good.  i don't listen to pet sounds much because i'm just not really into the high-vocal, pop sound going on here.  regardless, i find the psychology of the album fascinating.  it's commonly referred to as a \\"coming of age\\" album, and in every song, you can hear brian wilson's fragile, sensitive personality trying to come to terms with the grown-up world he's just now experiencing.  the very fact that he was able to get something like this across in pop music is pretty amazing.  he longs for a perfect romantic world on \\"wouldn't it be nice,\\" simulatenously explores the joy of love and the terror of its absence on \\"god only knows,\\" and mourns the passing of his love and a more innocent worldview on \\"caroline, no.\\"      one song in particular that i love but gets overlooked is \\"that's not me.\\"  while the vocals sound upbeat, the lyrics portray an absolutely heartbreaking scenario - brian's out in the big, wild, lonely world, completely removed from the comfort and love of his home, and knows \\"that's not him.\\"  the lyrics are understated but so sad.      the other songs might not be as intense, but they're fun to sing and well-made.  they cover problems brian has with other people, like uptight people with big egos, a girl he waited around for but doesn't love him now, and a great warning to \\"the new guy\\" about his former lover in \\"here today.\\"     the other beach boys did a great job singing on the album, even though they were despicable hacks who treated brian like [...] and butchered these songs in the 80's.     while brian's new \\"smile\\" album is good, i don't think it really measures up to the innocence and charm of \\"pet sounds.\\"
068485743X|3.0|This book, though relatively short, has a curiously padded feel to it- as if Lukeman is<br /><br />expanding a pretty good idea for a long article or series of articles into a full-blown<br /><br />book. Don't get me wrong- the book is worth its price, but the aspiring novelist, having<br /><br />read of Lukeman's formidable accomplishments as an agent/editor, comes away with the<br /><br />impression that he would rather have the guy as an agent than his book for its advice. At<br /><br />least this one did.<br /><br />My chief problem with this book is that he's found a clever premise and title and doesn't<br /><br />really follow through. I was expecting a detailed analysis of how to start a novel that<br /><br />will catch the eye of an agent or acquisitions editor; what I got instead was a more general<br /><br />manual on how to write to be published. This is not bad, mind you, but neither is it really<br /><br />consistent with the title.<br /><br />There are enough practical tips and informative tidbits (i.e., in 1996, only 11 books sold<br /><br />over 1 million copies in hardcover) to make this book worth buying. Just don't expect it to<br /><br />explain to you how to actually handle the first 5 pages of your manuscript. It does do<br /><br />that, but not as exhaustively as one would hope. The upside is that there is a lot more<br /><br /> useable stuff there as well.
B000F3AAUW|5.0|I read a review that said Cee-Lo's voice is part Al Green, Roland Gift (Fine Young Cannibals) and Jimmy Somerville (Bronski Beat). I was intrigued. That compared with the brilliance that is Danger Mouse compelled me to give this CD a listen. Ok. So now I am hooked. This album has crawled under my skin and I can't stop listening to it. A little bit of everything is on here and appeals to all of my musical tastes. I highly recommend this one.
B000AMPZF8|5.0|I have an internship at a company that advises other companies what is going to be hot and work for them in the future. So, not to sound caulky but, being the proud fan I am, MUSE IS GOING TO BE TIMELESS. I would compare Muse to Coldplay and Radiohead for the US easily. Their songs are eerie masterpieces you can't hear enough of. End of story :) oh wow I love Muse. Even if they are not recognized now, their work will be eventually.
B00004STUL|1.0|A friend lent this to me - after seeing a bit of it, I just skimmed through the rest to see the action sequences. I agree with all of the one star reviews. Bad acting, lame comedy, and even the explosions start to become boring. Crap all the way. Doesn't deserve even one star. Minus 100 stars, I'd say.
B000DWMYQ8|1.0|I am still waiting for these studios to learn that going out and buying a bunch of computers and graphics software does not make you Pixar.<br /><br />The characters are drawn badly, their movements are ruff and awkward, and the story line is uncreative and dull.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly is an excellant SciFi series that was cancelled to soon.  It should be brought back or a new show should be spin-off from it. <br />The show had good characters and a good storyline. It was worth looking at. I think a new series would be worth watching.
B0007YXREU|5.0|I'm not a huge Southpark fan, think its fairly funny when I stumble across it when channel surfing, but don't go out of my way to track it down.  This movie, however is hilarious.  No one goes unscathed.  This movie brings some perspective to American intervention overseas, moronic celebrities with an insufferable sense of self importance, evil dictators, the UN, the French, country music, gays, straights and many more.  Sure it is crude humor, but it is very funny.  The songs are hilarious, the dialogue is clever and just watching the puppets made it all the more absurd and funny!
B000003TA4|5.0|Go back to the early 90's and you'll see that Nirvana's Nevermind album was a huge success, cut back to 2006 and Nevermind still hold's up as one of the greatest albums of all time. This is an awesome cd, its one of the few cd's I own that I can listen to the whole thing without skipping tracks. Even though a true Nirvana fan thinks In Utero is the better of the two, this is still a good cd. If your a Nirvana fan and you dont own any of there cd's, I urge you to buy this one.  <br /> <br />and to some of the other reviews......you should never compare Nirvana to Led Zepplin, pretty much because there two different styles of music as well as generation's. Its like comparing a kids movie to Scarface or Taxi Driver, there just to different to compare and say ones better than the other. So shut your face! <br /> <br />Also, the \\"With Lights Out\\" box set by Nirvana is awesome. Any fans of Nirvana who doesn't own it should go buy it right now......
B000BW7QWW|4.0|Gem of a sci fi film. Will be checking out the tv show dvd's.
B000F5GNX8|5.0|Robert Downey Jr. plays Harry, a petty theif who suddenly stumbles upon a possible acting career. Val Kilmer plays \\"Gay Perry\\", the private detective-turned-mentor attempting to show Harry the ropes of his business. But when Harry's long-time crush, Harmony (Michelle Monaghan), requests detective help from Harry who is not actually a detective, things go out of control. This movie is smart, wickeldy clever, completely jawdropping and downright hilarious as Shane Black mixes comedy and action smoother than silk and butter in this one-of-a-kind screenplay.
B000641Z90|5.0|The next best thing to seeing Phil Collins in concert.  Enthusiastic performer and does all the great hits!!  You won't be disappointed!
B0000CDLA7|5.0|This cd is incredible in basically every way. John Petrucci's guitar playing is still unbelievable in its speed and ferocity. The guitar solo in the intro of \\"This Dying Soul\\" has a sweet wah part with John's shredding. It leads into a beautiful melody that features one of the coolest guitar tones I've heard. Mike Portnoy's drumming is unstoppable and cutting edge as far as metal drumming goes (and it goes far). <br />Buy it. <br />-I'll Eat You <br />    Soon!!!
B00012QM8G|5.0|If you've never seen this film - you MUST!  Exquisite and disturbing...a MUST for any movie library!  Liam Neeson is MARVELOUS in the title role and Ben Kingsley and the rest of the cast are haunting. Also a fascinating history lesson for us all!
B000G75AE8|4.0|Once again extreme metal's forefathers have delivered another excellent slab of metal in the patented Slayer style.  Of all the thrash bands from the 80's, Slayer is the only one that has managed to consistently put out good album after good album. _Christ Illusion_ delivers the goods again with mucho aggression and speed. As par the course, we don't really see Slayer breaking any new ground here - but then again that's not what I expect from a Slayer album. I expect a Slayer album to remain consistent to their tried and tested sound, deliver speed and fury, and have some wicked guitar solos. This album delivers in spades. If I want music that pushes boundaries and experiments with various styles, I'll check out some other band. Some will dismiss this album as not the equal of _Reign in Blood_, but that's a tall order to fill and probably one that won't ever be delivered. _Reign in Blood_ was a truly special album. Such albums generally only come along once in a band's career. Each album should be judged separately by its own merits. By that standard, this is another excellent release by a classic band. Hail Slayer! <br /> <br />My Rating System: <br />5 Stars = Masterwork (rarely given) <br />4 Stars = Excellent  <br />3 Stars = Good <br />2 Stars = Mediocre <br />1 Stars = Bad
0440241413|4.0|Rebecca is a totally nuerotic character that I was rooting for during the whole book. The way Sophie Kinsella writes this character is so amazing. I have never read a book like this before. I really liked the way this book ended.<br />I will definately read more by this author. This was a fun little juant.
B000F48CD8|1.0|Arguing about the merits of this band is like debating whether it is better to shove your nail or a pencil into your eye.  Both are equally bad choices and should be avoided--just as this junk needs to be given a very wide body-swerve. <br /> <br />The Raconteurs are nothing more than a tired blast of everything you've heard before played badly by some morons who should be serving you burgers.  This CD is utter, total and banal horse manure.  Without question it is a temperature reading of just how dire things have become when used toilet paper is sold as a valuable commodity, while good albums (imaginative, incisive and creative) don't win any prizes.  For Christ's sake, I beseech you to buy Scott Walker's The Drift rather than this!  If appalling music is a cancer, then is a cancer stewed twice and brought back to give it another run.   <br /> <br />Just like The White Stripes, who are the equivalent of listening to The Cramps and Captain Beefheart on mind-pummelling, taste-neutralising tranquillisers (yes - I wish I had no talent, Jack - then we could all die braindead and happy!), then this utter detritus is a tour through all the things you never cared about enough to save before you last switched them off.  I sincerely hope that all the `musicians' concerned who made this vomit die really horrible deaths, as they can never pay me back for the minutes they stole from me while I wasted my time listening to their output. <br /> <br />I actually took my copy of this album and threw it with all my might into the bin in my study.  Pleasingly it shattered on impact and I actually hoped--via some contagious occult link ala Frazer--that it might have resulted in the band shattering as well.  No such luck, as I checked the entertainment news and there wasn't one headline saying \\"over-hyped idiots explode into hundreds of pieces\\".   Instead I will have to content myself with watching them suck on the world stage until the cynically marketed void they are exploiting swallows them whole and causes them to vanish from musical history without a trace. <br /> <br />Final Score:  you should only buy this album if you've never heard any other music, don't know anything about music and think music is a waste of everyone's time.  This is bilge and it could stink out an entire room in Kane's mansion.
B000001DTM|5.0|I love this album. Classic songs. One, Until the End of the World, Mysterious Ways, So Cruel, the Fly, and many others really show U2's incredible style. This or Joshua Tree is the best album by U2. And since U2 is my favorite band, in my opinion, these are the best albums ever. If you're not a U2 fan just listen to One or Until the End of the World, and you'll see what makes this band so great. Great album. If you don't have this album, get it. You haven't heard real music until you listen to this.
B00003CXAA|5.0|The GODFATHER trilogy needs no introduction.  THE GODFATHER, released in 1972 and based on Mario Puzo's novel (at one time the bestselling novel of all time), is considered by many to be the greatest film of all time.  It was directed and co-written by young Francis Ford Coppola, who did an absolutely outstanding job.  Gordon Willis' unflinching and beautiful cinematography is superb, while Nino Rota's sweeping score is unforgettable.  The cast is magnificent.  Marlon Brando, in his signature role as wheezy-voiced Don Vito Corleone, is marvelous, as is Al Pacino as his youngest son, Michael Corleone.  Michael has vowed never to get involved in the family business, but the attempted murder of his father forces him to take action.  James Caan is also excellent as the hot-tempered Sonny Corleone. <br /> <br />One of the most debated questions amongst movie buffs is which is better - THE GODFATHER part I or THE GODFATHER: PART II?  Though many will say that THE GODFATHER is superior, just as many will argue that THE GODFATHER: PART II is the best.  Either way, it's an equally impressive film that's even more epic than its predecessor.  About 3/5 of the film follows Michael Corleone's rule as Don in 1958; the other 2/5 follow young Vito Corleone's (Robert De Niro) arrival in New York City in the early-1900s and his uprising as a mob boss.  De Niro is excellent; he won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his role.  Pacino's performance is extraodinary, the highlight of his career.  The cinematography, script and directing are as flawless as ever, and Nino Rota's score is even more grandiose than before. <br /> <br />THE GODFATHER: PART III is one of the most controversial films ever made.  As a normal film, it's very good; however, as a GODFATHER film, it's quite weak.  The film begins in 1979, where aging Michael Corleone has finally ceased his involvement with the mob and is enjoying a reputation as a philanthropist.  Victor Mancini (Andy Garcia), the illegitimate son of Michael's deceased brother Sonny, comes to Michael seeking a job, and soon after a mob war ensues, pulling Michael back in to the world of the mafia.  The film lacks the power and feeling of the first two films; it just doesn't feel like a GODFATHER movie.  It was made for money because Francis Ford Coppola's Zoetrope Studios was going bankrupt; it was not made because it needed to be made.  Another of the film's biggest flaws is Sofia Coppola as Michael's daughter; as a director, she is quite talented, but as an actress, she is not so talented, and is woefully miscast.  I would recommend seeing the film if only to quell your curiosity, and because it has a truly fantastic ending. <br /> <br />THE GODFATHER and THE GODFATHER: PART III are 1-disc sets; THE GODFATHER: PART II is a 2-disc set.  Each film has been remastered in beautiful anamorphic widescreen and with excellent Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround sound.  They are packaged in gorgeous, dark thin packaging, and each features full-length commentary with director Coppola.  Exclusive to this set is a disc of bonus material running over three hours, including deleted scenes (and the footage from the TV versions), alternate scenes, behind-the-scenes footage, and a Corleone family tree.  The bonus disc will knock the socks off GODFATHER fans. <br /> <br />If you haven't seen these films - you have no clue what you're missing.  I would recommend that you drop what you're doing and go out and purchase this set right now.  The first two films are probably the best ever made, and the third is good as well.  For the reasonably low price this set sells at, it's an offer you can't refuse.
B0001LJC2K|5.0|There are very few CDs where I like MOST of the song.  On this one I LOVE most of the tracks!  They infuse rock (and I mean ROCK!) with what sounds like Romantic-era Russian Classical music (especially evident in Matt Bellamy's excellent piano work - for instance in songs such as \\"Apocalypse Please\\" and \\"Butterflies and Hurricanes\\"), and dark, apocalyptic lyrics - and the songs manage to stay in your head.  This is a CD that I've listened to over and over, sometimes not listening to any other music for days!<br /><br />They have some softer songs which are also beautiful.  \\"Falling Away\\" is one of them.<br /><br />While they've been compared to many bands, I think they've developed and maintain their own sound.  Yes, they tend to be dramatic, and maybe to some, a bit over the top, but they create such beautiful music.  And even though I like their other work, I keep coming back to this one (though if you like this, I do encourage you to at least try out the others as they are also very good).
B00005JOYM|1.0|I saw this movie on opening day and wondered why it was called \\"World Trade Center\\".  This film, directed by Oliver Stone is mainly about two Port Authority Police Officers, John McLoughlin (Nicholas Cage) and William J. Jimeno (Michael Pena) who are trapped in the rubble after the South Tower collapses.  Cage's acting lacks instinct, emotion and depth.  Michael Pena at least lends credibility to his character. The story Stone relays is robbed of dramatic tension, mainly because it was in the news media that these two officers were found alive.  So what the audience is left with within minutes of the movie, is the officers laying in rubble and talking to each other, while their wives' and families share grief and worry awaiting the outcome. <br /> <br />Misleading in its title, this movie does not even skim the surface of being a definitive account of the devastation that took place at the World Trade Centers on 9/11. Since Stone was hell bent on making a movie on this subject, he should have added elements included in the documentaries such as the Naudet brothers'  \\"9/11\\" and the CBS documentary \\"What We Saw\\" or relaying events from the book \\"102 Minutes\\",  detailing first hand accounts of people who survived and did not survive that day.  Oliver Stone makes the assumption that we all know the details of the hundreds of stories of that day, and that he doesn't need to put his story in that context.  Other than a bunch of papers flying through the air and the occasional bit of CNN news footage half way through the film,  there's very little evidence of the shocking events of that day and what civilians and rescue workers witnessed. Because of the title of this film, Stone has created a disservice to all the men and women who lived through or died that day. If Stone felt he was being respectful by leaving these things out, then the result is that the movie has taken one of the most compelling and dramatic events in American history and reduced it to one small story that doesn't even come close to the full scope of what happened that day. Stone should rename this film to better identify what he chose as his only story line.
B000E41MS6|5.0|Pure joy. As someone who grew up with William Hartnell, the good Doctor has never really been far from my consciousness even if it meant watching video tapes until they wore out. This has all the feel of a production by people who have not only a knowledge of the subject but a real love for it, in the same way as Peter Jackson's \\"Lord of the Rings.\\"  <br />Of course it has its ups and downs. Why worry? Take it for what it is. Sit back and enjoy the ride and be thankful that someone ever had the vision, in the first place, to put a show like Doctor Who on the air. <br />This set rocks.
B000G75AE8|3.0|I am sorry, but most Slayer fans were dissapointed with the last two albums.  The band strayed away from their signature sound in an attempt to modernize and to expand their fan base.  With this album, Slayer have given up that false hope and returned to their roots.  Unfortunately, this album still isn't all that great.   <br />First the positive: <br /> Most of the songs are fast and thrashy, and the missing-in-action leadwork is back.  Tom screams about killing, war, and hating religion (all Slayer staples). There isn't too much new-metal incorporated into the album, although there is still some.  They chose to use a bunch of leftover material from their early days.  \\"Jihad\\" is a great modern-sounding Slayer song.  Tom doesn't just scream curse words as lyrics as on \\"God Hates Us All\\".  The biggest positive is that for the first time in fifteen years, Slayer has released an album that sounds like it was created by Slayer. <br />Now for the negative:      <br />Tom is still doing the annoying punk thing he picked up when the band did \\"Undisputed Attitude\\".  It's not like he was ever the greatest singer anyways, but this makes it worse.  Kerry wrote most of the songs, so while they are fast, they really aren't all that great.  Most of the riffs sound like inferior rehashings of older material.  For instance, the opening riff of \\"Flesh Storm\\" is just a variation of the opening riff to \\"Angel of Death\\".  While Dave Lombardo is an incredible drummer, he never did anything all that special with Slayer except play fast.  Of course, Tom's bass playing is ever-absent.  A few of the songs just drag on and on, and they get quite annoying.  Honestly, this album just sounds like a collection of crappy B-sides from the past 15 years. It is 2/3 \\"Seasons\\" (the worst from this album)and 1/3 \\"God Hates Us All\\"(Perhaps the best from this record).  All of this \\"Reign in Blood\\"-style talk is unfounded.  It's not that fast, and one speed-metal riff does not mean that this album soundslike \\"Show No Mercy\\".    <br />It is a thrash album.  It does sound like slayer.  Lots of crazy leads(actually, the leadwork is more structured than in the past, and in many ways better).  Dave is back.  If this album came out a decade ago, I would have cared.  Not now.  It just isn't good enough to be relevant.  Too little, too late.
0596007124|4.0|I find this book is really helpful in not only explain patterns, but helping you remember their names and short definitions.  The examples are good where-in they are short but meaningful.  You need to be decent at writing java code though.
B000GGSM7G|2.0|4 stars for the album, 2 docked because of the mastering screw up. <br />As the previous reviewer said... my copy also has a couple of seconds or so missing from the beginning of Shake Dog Shake.  That may not seem like much time, but it does ruin the effect of the intro.  Why, why, WHY can't these record companies get these remasters right?  We fans buy this stuff over and over and they keep screwing them up.
6305972591|3.0|I just bought this film around last Halloween. I'd never seen 1984's \\"Children Of The Corn,\\" and as a lover of Old School horror, I was anxious to watch it. I've seen horror films much, much gorier than this, but you really don't need a lot of it to have yourself a good horror flick. Sometimes just the power of suggestion is enough to scare the heck out of you. This film shows you just the right amount of both and it is an enjoyable movie for the 80's horror fans. It may be a bit too tame for the hardcore horror fans, but it's a pretty good film based on Stephen King's novel.   <br /> <br />Welcome to the sleepy town of Gatlin, Nebraska......maybe a little too sleepy.....like a dead sleepy. Indeed the town is ghostlike, save an evil religious cult of kids who have brutally slaughtered all the adults and left deranged satanic paintings and trails of cornhusks all over town. Cornhusks? Yes, cornhusks. This violent group of evil holds their main base in a huge cornfield in the lazy Nebraska flatlands. Lead by Isaac (John Franklin), a preacher who spreads the word of  \\"He who walks behind the rows,\\" and Malachai (Courtney Gains), Isaac's pawn who carries out the deity's wishes in the most gruesome of ways, the cult has taken Gatlin as their own and goes out to \\"spill blood\\" of any \\"outlanders.\\" Oh yes, and that includes any members of the cult who decide to betray the corn deity. But this cult is strictly for youthful beings. According to \\"He who walks behind the rows\\": \\"And a child shall lead them.\\"  <br /> <br />Vicky (Linda Hamilton) and Burton (Peter Horton), are two unfortunate adults who have traveled to this pitiful Nebraska town, as Burton is preparing for a job as a doctor. After getting caught in a horrible accident on the vacant road near the corn, the two decide to venture into Gatlin to seek help. They quickly find that people keep a little too much to themselves in Gatlin and all they find are shops littered with the sacrilegious corn creations and a bunchof strange youngsters wielding blades. The only bright spot they find is two little kids who have not yet been sucked in to the beliefs of the cult; Job (Robby Kiger) and his psychic-drawing sister Sarah (Anne Marie McEvoy). Together, the four of them work up a plan to escape from the horrible corn cult members and find a way to banish the evil deity from the cornfield. Can you say, \\"burning stubble?\\" But it won't be easy. Isaac's preaching easily contaminates the minds of those around him, and Malachai's thirst for slashing and blood dominates his every waking hour. It's a powerfully evil combination that makes a cult of kids a true hellish nightmare. <br /> <br />Personally, I thought the overall acting was mediocre at best when I first viewed \\"Children Of The Corn.\\" After seeing it a few times more since, I've narrowed it down to two people. Linda Hamilton's acting as Vicky can be downright annoying with her persistent \\"Can we leave now?\\" \\"I don't think this is a road,\\" and \\"Just tell me where we are.\\" And that birthday song she sings for Burton at the start of the movie makes me grit my teeth with pain. Her acting could have been a lot better if she put a bit more feeling into her lines. It just seemed flat to me somehow. I didn't think Peter Horton as Burton was too bad, although his mocking of the religious speeches on his car radio was less than amusing. His acting was a little flat at times too, but not as bad as Hamilton's. He has an earnestness about him during the more intense scenes when he's confronting the cult of kids, trying to get Sarah to talk to him, and working with Job to cast away the evil deity. It comes across as fairly genuine and he actually sucked me into his character. John Franklin was incredible as Isaac! His eyes are dark and evil and he can do a mean twisted smirk. When he preaches, he puts that umph behind every word; demanding.....earnest.....insistent.....just like a true fire and brimstone preacher desperately trying to get his point across. Courtney Gains as Malachai was probably my favorite though. That guy was just downright disturbing with his evil, narrowed eyes, devilish grin and warped scowl. His voice is seething, intense and loud, as if stretching every vocal chord in his throat. The sight of him with a blade was unnerving. The little kids, Job and Sarah were fairly well cast. They really capture the youth and innocence, not to mention normality that used to be in Gatlin, and really help contrast this with the evil that they are surrounded by. This bipolar tension makes the movie good. <br /> <br />The music fits this film so well. During attacks that are about to reach a climax, we hear a loud church-choir like group speak/sing in melodic, intense religious chants. It is absolutely awesome! And again there is the sweet tension there; the religious chants, which are supposed to be good, being sung while evil is being done. The main title theme features high haunting vocals from youth; no words, just notes. It really captures the intensity of the film that much more. <br /> <br />I guess I should get to my favorite scene, huh? Well, I actually have two. I'm a fan of horror, so I like intensity. Two of the most intense scenes come in the first part of the film when the cult slaughters the adults in the café and when Malachai sends Joseph to his maker while he's trying to escape. The attack wounds look pretty real and the makeup is very well done. The props are great too; all the cornhusks and evil drawings in the stores, and I also need to mention that dusty town of tumbleweeds, corn fields, old farms and empty rat infested stores. The feeling of isolation in a sleepy town with nothing but evil to come get you, just screams at you. Included in this film is also the original theatrical trailer. Nothing major, but still a kick to watch, and the narrator of it has a voice made for horror. <br /> <br />Well, I think I've said all I need to say about \\"Children Of The Corn.\\" Whether you want a fairly disturbing scare, a nostalgic trip back to the 80's horror days, or just a plain old horror film for Halloween, grab up 1984's \\"Children Of The Corn.\\"                <br />
B00005O3VC|5.0|I accidently ruined my nephew's Monty Python and the Holy Grail dvd while they were visiting.  I had a week to get him a new copy.  I ordered from Amazon on Sunday, used normal shipping, and had the dvd in my hands on Wednesday.  I think that is really fast.  The movie is a classic so what can I say.  The packaging looked good and I think there was some extra stuff on it.
B000G75AE8|4.0|Chances are, there are some of you out there whose parents are about the same age as the guys in Slayer. A large amount of gray has crept into Tom Araya's beard, and all of the band members are showing the signs of their battles with father time. Of course, Slayer could care less about father time, and this album shows it; they have returned to crank out an album that might make guys half their age jealous.     Dave Lombardo has returned to hold down drum duty after a 16-year absence from Slayer studio recordings; he's actually been back with the band for several years. Kerry King and Jeff Hanneman are back to their lightning-fast riffing, and Tom Araya still sounds as angry as ever. On the whole, the band seems like they're channeling Reign in Blood; there are lots of quick riffs, plenty of double-bass thunder and up-tempo beats, and solos aplenty. There are plenty of slower sections to keep the whole thing from becoming monotonous, but overall, Slayer's return to their \\"classic\\" sound is welcome after all these years. Naturally, Slayer aren't afraid to explore the darker aspects of life and society; \\"Flesh Storm\\" blasts the media for glorification of war and violence, while \\"Jihad\\" takes a look at the 9/11 attacks from a terrorist's perspective. In all, the album serves up a healthy dose of vitriol against war, injustice, politics, and, of course, religion. This record hits hard and hits fast; no fancy two-stepping around anything.      Slayer have shown that, after all these years, they still have it in them to make a great metal album. For more than two decades they have done their own thing and have acheived success on their own terms. And they're still mad as hell and won't take it anymore.
B0000542DH|5.0|Natural Born Killers is one of the most controversial films ever made and why would't it? a film about seriel killers? thats got to push some buttons there. not only that but several real life murders were copied of this film and even dialouge was reportedly said during the killings. so why see such a film? when it hits the right marks and pulls it off. Stone combines such wild, lush, and crazy film editing to depict the minds of Vickey and Mallory, crazy dialogue, unique story telling, and all the while poking fun at how we as the people and the media go crazy for it. the film tells of the two sociopaths in love, Vickey and Mallory, as they cut a blood soaked path across america while the public goes crazy, making them into pop culture icons. for some, they will love the movie but for others they may be turned of at the violence in the film and some of the scenes shown so just a little forwarding. but still, if your an Oliver Stone fan then this movie is a must for your collection.
0525948023|5.0|I think Eckhart Tolle may become to be seen as one of the prophets of spiritual history.  His message is so powerful, so simple, and so available to anyone. And as all things that are the real deal.........it takes discipline and constant vigilance to acheive the result!
0684833395|5.0|Catch 22 is a satirical masterpiece of 5 central themes: insanity, the brutality of war, free will versus determinism, moral debasement, and death. Each character is a unique archetype that embodies a supporting idea. The ideas include the cyclic run of Catch 22, the absurdity of a non-sequitir world, the ridicule pinned on sychophants, hypocrites, the sexually imprisoned, the logical lapses of high military officials, the religious officials that lose faith, all of which culminate in a heap of drama, irony, humour, and social commentary.     Another key idea at the crux of the novel is time. One of the reasons that I was able to enjoy reading the novel after already having read it before was the complex chronological structure. The novel is not chronologically consistent in any pattern: it isn't written from beginning to end, vice versa, nor in media res. Rather, time is jumbled in a mess, which enhances the entire effect of life under Catch 22: and confusing, helpless mess.    The novel is also held together by black humour. Heller pokes fun at many areas in the microcosmic story that are inherently not funny at all. With skill and genius, the novel is a work that discusses grave topics in a manner that is light yet effective, humourous but poignant.    I was at Barnes and Nobles just yesterday and Catch 22 had the center poster spread. Like, omg.
B00009NHC5|5.0|This is one of Audrey Hebburn's best performances.  And this is one of the best suspense thrillers to ever come out of Hollywood.  The all-star cast certainly helps make this movie a classic that I shall watch time and time again.
0425152251|1.0|Please save yourself the time and money and refrain from this book which is borderline antisemitic and is plain BORING. I never heard of this author and now I understand why.  <br />It did serve me well when I needed some paper to start off my grill fire this summmer, but I supoose that I could have found cheaper source than that. <br />In short - pure and unadulterated boredome!!
1400079179|1.0|An incredibly brilliant, yet utterly spineless bozo gets bossed around by a French government cryptologist with the inexplicable resourcefulness of lady James Bond. Together they manage to unravel the biggest pseudo mystery in history and make saps out of millions of gullible readers in the process. A little research will expose some appallingly inaccurate descriptions of artwork and entirely fabricated rewritings of religious and renaissance history. As for all the fans out there who keep repeating what Dan Brown said about the story being written as fiction, it doesn't justify such obvious manipulations of reality and truth. Not to mention the fact that he went out of his way to state the accuracy of his work with a disclaimer in the front of the book. And despite having some genuine moments of suspense, it is sometimes done without much creativity, where information that is already known by the character in question is merely withheld from the reader. As for the underlying message of the story, Brown attempts to make the statement that the Church and all things masculine are the true root of evil and that real purity comes only from that which is feminine. I am not sure whether he just hates the Catholic Church (or Christianity in general) or simply gets aroused by anything estrogen. Either way, the book would have been better served had it at least attempted to base some of it's major revelations in fact, done away with most of the babbling on feminine perfection and applied more realism to the main characters. However, if you do decide to read it, I strongly recommend forgetting as much of the history and art descriptions as possible to avoid accidently quoting it as fact and looking like a blithering idiot as a result.
B000C65Z1G|5.0|Lots of negative criticism has been generated about this movie. About the politics, about the story, about the way they play with time and flashbacks. It all maybe true, but it is still one of the most beautiful and intelligent movies out there. <br /> <br />It starts by doing something not many movies are able to do, that is best their literary origin; \\"the Constar Gardener\\" film is much better than TCG book. And that is a lot to say John LeCarre being the author. <br /> <br />Fernando Meirelles the director fills the screen with astounding visuals, that jump out of the screen and hit you in the face like saying \\"keep looking, do not miss a beat\\". And what to say of the acting, Fiennes, Weist and all the supporting cast are at their best, conveying emotion right thru your heart.    <br /> <br />One of the best examples of great moviemaking in recent years. If you can look over politics and such you deserve to enjoy this movie.  <br />
B000046PVN|5.0|Other than the over kill of \\"Can you read my mind\\", an excellent collection.
B00004STUL|5.0|Jerry Bruckheimer and Michael Bay make an excellent team! When they work together, explosions rock the screen, profanity is spewed between characters, and corpses far outnumber the amount of lines spoken. This is one of Will Smith's early ventures in film, and to be honest, I think this is his breakthrough role as Mike Lowrey, a playboy cop with a taste for gritty gunfights. Martin Lawrence is hilarious as Mike's partner, Marcus Burnett, a family man whose gig constantly interferes with his family life. Tea Leoni is okay, but not great, and her role seems a bit weird, as though it was just randomly stuck in the plot. The bad guy is a typical villain, with few lines and a thick accent. The action scenes are, of course, Bruckheimer-worthy, and so you wont be disappointed. The cinematography adds to the film's good parts. Overall, a movie that is fun, brainless stuff.
0385504209|1.0|Despite the magnaminous fame that this novel received, I must say that it wasn't a good one at all. The author wanted a controversary, and he got it, but it wasn't built on strong basis. The point he is trying to discuss is not clear. Did he want to say that Jesus was a man? Or that Jesus was married? Or did he just want to defend pagan rituals? Honestly I can't figure it out yet. The novel also presents flawed information, and that is quite misguiding. It also weakens the author's position. If you want to prove a point then don't tell me lies. I also didn't like the \\"everything is based on a conspiracy\\" tone. Secret unknown organiztions don't control people. The story of Mary Magdalene was well documented years before this novel came into existence. The image of Jesus has been discussed for thousands of years across different religions and ideologies. This book poorly collects inofrmation presenting it in a misleading sensualized manner. I don't recommend it.

B00004C8TC|5.0|One of the main virtues of Radu Lupu has always been his impeccable fluency, interpretative brio, inexhaustible good taste, crystalline phrasing and expansive sonority.<br /><br />As a matter of fact my first contact with Lupu was precisely with the Grieg Piano Concerto and I must confess, this version engaged me, because of the profound conviction, and admirable lyricism.<br /><br />He has remained as one the  most renowned pianists around the world, so you should acquire this legendary album that so many praised comments aroused in that decade.<br /><br />The Schumann's Piano concerto belongs to Ivan Moravec with the Czech Philharmonic; however this is a very solvent and distinguished performance.
B000001ELP|4.0|After reading some of the reviews, I decided to give \\"The Elder\\" another listen.  I have been a KISS for several years, and have enjoyed all eras and line-ups.  Nothing compares to the music on the first 6 studio albums in the '70's, but KISS music was also strong in the '80's and '90's (Creatures, Lick It Up, Revenge).  I prefer to listen to 80's KISS over Poison or Warrant any day!  When I first purchased The Elder back in the late '80's I was completely turned off with the exception of \\"I\\".  I have listened to it off and on over the years, and after a listen yesterday, I must admit The Elder is a very strong, rocking album.  Sure, it's not perfect, but at least KISS was trying to evolve.  With songs like Under The Rose, The Oath, and I, the Elder is a fantastic album.  I wish Gene and Paul would stop bashing The Elder and embrace it.  I would love to hear some songs from this album performed live, because despite what Gene and Paul say, \\"The Elder\\" is a KISS album. <br />
B000DWMN2S|4.0|Don't let the DVD cover, nor the use of Elijah Wood as the tentpole for the advertising campaign, fool you. This movie is a beautiful story of one young Jewish man's attempt to discover himself via a fact-finding mission in his grandfather's native Russia. His hapless \\"translator,\\" Alex (who is an American rap enthusiast) is both a lead character as well as the sidekick in young Jonathan's quest. It is Alex's \\"premium\\" narration and commentary, along with a host of eccentric characters and a suprise discovery of the boys' shared past, that make the movie such a joy. It is a worthy addition to the list of personal stories made in and around World War II and it's holocausts.<br /><br />As far as movie adaptations of incredible books go, this one is probably within my top ten favorites. That being said, I have to add that as someone who has repeatedly read the novel this movie is based on, it was somewhat of a letdown to find the entire folk-lore of author Jonathan Safran Foer's family had been cut, most likely to allow for a more concise movie that didn't run too long over two hours. The movie was good, but the book is INCREDIBLE, and I recommend that the potential viewer read the book first for more backstory.
B000002LGQ|5.0|To me, this is Madonna's best work.  I love this cd and love to still listen to it often.  It was definately one of her most controversial especially with the release of the title track and the video that went along with it. <br />One of my favourite Madonna songs is Express Yourself which is on here so that for me is the best on the album.  Coming after that are Oh Father, Promise To Try, Cherish and Keep It Together.  This album is fun because it's one you can dance to, and really enjoy.  There are the ballads and the pop songs that to me, are much better than the style she's going for now.  I really love this cd and recommend it to all fans and non fans too.  It's great.
B000FQJAIW|3.0|I remember seeing the \\"Special Edition\\" of A New Hope in the theaters nearly a decade ago. While I was blown away with seeing a Star Wars film on the big screen, much of the \\"special\\" material left me with mixed emotions. Then came the rest of the films and by the time I got to the musical scene in Jabba's Palace I was simply depressed. Then came episodes I-III and I slowly began to stop caring at all. <br /> <br />The last and only version of Star Wars I bought (and still own) was the VHS boxed set of the original films. So, while I can understand the rage of everyone who has bought a half-dozen versions of these films in the last ten years, I haven't fallen into that particular money pit. I simply preferred to do without the films if they had to be the special editions. I stuck to my dusty VHS tapes. <br /> <br />Lucas is clearly out to make as much money as possible from the franchise. That was obvious to me from the moment I left the theater after Episode I. So, I've patiently waited for the originals, flaws and all, to make their way back on the shelves. Now they have and I'll probably pick them up. Though, I can assure you it's only for the \\"bonus features\\" (i.e. the theatrical releases). The fact that it's weighted down with the \\"Special Editions\\" and the damage is done to my psyche, those VHS tapes are getting pretty fragile. <br /> <br />I'll take the bitter with the sweet.
B00005RHGL|5.0|A friend of ours lent my fiance and I the Vista Director's Cut of Tombstone last night. We watched it, noting all the scenes that we hadn't seen before. The movie is a fan-favorite of ours.<br /><br />Sure, it's not the best movie of all time. Sure sometimes it's a little hokey but Man, you've got Kurt Russell, Val Kilmer, Bill Paxton, Sam Elliot, Dana Delaney, Michael Biehn, Charlton Heston, Terry O'Quinn! Not to mention, sneak performances by four actors that are either so young or so different looking you might have missed them: Billy Zane, Jason Priestly, Thomas Haden Church, and Billy Bob Thorton as the tubby nasty gambling guy! Right there, that much star power should make it an amazing movie!<br /><br />But there's more. It's all about the performances! Kilmer as Doc Holliday is sublime. His continuingly-sweating pale face, his draw, his sublime sense of humor - God, he's great in this movie! Then you have Russell as Wyatt Earp! Unbelievable! You can feel his rage, hear the gravel in his voice, and feel for a man who isn't as moral as most \\"heroes\\" are but still is a sympathetic character! Then there are Earp's brothers. Both Paxton and Elliot give great performances! And Biehn is as scary and as convincing as he was in the Abyss! I love Michael Biehn. He's one of the more overlooked actors of our ages.<br /><br />All in all, you have great acting, fantastic cinematography, a stirring story, some really great dialogue (\\"You know, if I didn't think you were my friend, Ed, I don't think I could bear it\\"), and lots of gun-fighting. What more could you want in a movie?
B000AARKOO|3.0|Kingdom of Heaven had one of the best production quality that year it came out. The photography, cinematography, and music are good. This is a big screen spectacular. <br /> <br />Unfortuanately, the story is pretty boring and the \\"good guy\\" have so little personality, it is not a very involving experience. The character with the most charisma is played by Liam Neesom and he does not have that much screen time. <br /> <br />If you are like me and can appreciate good production quality, it will be worthwhile. If you are like most people and are more interested in a story and it's characters, you will likely be disappointed.  <br /> <br />
1593082452|3.0|I'd read that F. Scott Fitzgerald, older, a full-blown alcoholic with his wife in an insane asylum, went into a bookstore to find all of his books out of print and no longer on the shelves.  Not even THE GREAT GATSBY.  Wow.<br /><br />If it wasn't for the personal history of the author, I don't think I would've enjoyed Fitzgerald's second novel, THE BEAUTIFUL AND DAMNED.  The first half of the book follows a young couple living the high life in New York City, partying every night, waiting on a rich grandfather to drop dead so they can get their hands on his fortune, annoyed by World War I for interferring with their travel plans.  I didn't like these people.  They were snobbish and superficial, the worst kind of social climbers since they never accomplished anything.  Anthony was horrified at the thought of actually working at anything and Gloria coasted along on her looks, flirting with a movie career until her looks fade away.<br /><br />Fitzgerald's own snobbery is evident throughout.  On page 59, he turns up his nose to describe \\"The Public\\" (or \\"the Consumer\\"), the common folks out trying to enjoy themselves, and he also can't hide his distaste for the poor Southern mistress Anthony uses during his military service.<br /><br />I don't think I would've noticed it as much if he'd turned his critical eye to the arrogant fops who were Anthony's Harvard classmates.  But they end up rich, so Fitzgerald lets them spout their pretentious and shallow philosophies unchallenged.<br /><br />What was really interesting to me was that THE BEAUTIFUL AND DAMNED was written before Scott & Zelda Fitzgerald lived their own beautiful damnation, venturing much further into the dark than \\"Anthony & Gloria\\" and denied the \\"happy ending\\" manufactured for them.<br /><br />The Barnes & Noble Classics editions of classic novels are definitely worth reading.  Pagan Harleman's Introduction perfectly sets up this novel and the footnotes and endnotes help to broaden the reader's understanding.ding.

B000E1ZBGS|5.0|Considering that a large majority--if not all--of the negative reviews given to Joe Wright's adaptation of Jane Austen's \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is based on their comparison to the ever-popular BBC version, I must defend the other half that finds this movie an absolute delight. <br /> <br />First comes the matter of Wright condensing the novel to a point where it all seemed, I suspect, not enjoyable to many fans of the novel. But the fact is that Wright had two hours to portray Austen's rather lengthy novel as compared to the BBC version, which was a miniseries and, I believe, went through every single scene and detail of the novel. Not that I'm saying that there's anything wrong with that, but as a major movie fan, seeing Austen's book basically copied and pasted from the pages to a movie script, to me, lacks originality. Wright had his own original way of capturing the main plot of the movie in two hours, without dulling the characters in Austen's novel. Quickly going on a tangent, I will say that Wright's addition of the scene with Darcy and Elizabeth kissing was exceptionally romantic and it absolutely was consistent with their characters. But going back to the topic at hand: yeah, if BBC fans were disappointed that Wright seemed to rush everything, the truth of the matter is, he only had two hours. And yes, he could have included every little detail if he wanted to make the movie 5 hours. <br /> <br />Concerning the issues regarding Keira Knightley's role as the ever-proud Elizabeth Bennet and Matthew McFadyen's role as the timid Fitzwilliam Darcy, from the negative reviews I have read, viewers are complaining that Knightley and McFadyen did not do the characters justice. However, I must strongly disagree. Knightley, the wonderfully talented actress that she is, fulfilled Elizabeth's role to the fullest extent that any person could. Elizabeth's proud and stubborn nature was fully portrayed by Knightley and I can't think of any other reason to be dissatisfied. Although, yes, Knightley might be a bit too beautiful to play the role of the more comely Elizabeth, that is just about the only possible flaw with Knightley's role as Elizabeth. <br /> <br />As for McFadyen's role as Darcy, one reviewer stated that Darcy seemed \\"dull and generally uninterested in what's going on.\\" Again, I must defend how Darcy was depicted in the film. To me, McFadyen acted out Darcy's role as his character is; initially, when the viewer is introduced to Darcy at the ball, he is seen as \\"dull and uninterested,\\" which is mistaken by others--mainly Elizabeth--as pride and conceit. That was how the reader originally felt about Darcy in the book, and that is how the viewer originally felt about Darcy in the film. Others stated, \\"Austen's Darcy was well-spoken, proud and elegant, not in need of a Prozac.\\" However, is it just my lack of memory, or was Austen's novel not written from Elizabeth's point of view? Therefore, as Elizabeth found out about Darcy's true character, so did the reader. Wright, I believe, tried to depict Darcy's actual character to the viewers throughout the entire movie, rather than have him portrayed based on Elizabeth's prejudices. Also, Wright's version of Darcy is `well-spoken, proud and elegant,' so I don't know why one would say otherwise. As for the remark on the Prozac, is Darcy's character not clearly revealed to the viewer when he is with Georgiana in his home? I don't know what else there is to say about that. And then there's the infamous comparison between Colin Firth's acting abilities as Darcy as opposed to McFadyen. I, myself, have only seen bits and pieces of the BBC version, and from what I can tell, Firth does seem like a worthy actor to play the part of the loveable Darcy. However, I found McFadyen to not only fulfill the role as Darcy incredibly well, but I also think that McFadyen's appearances are far more handsome than Firth. <br /> <br />The next problem many viewers had was the lack of `spark' Knightley and McFadyen seemed to have on-screen. First of all, I don't think that Wright could have picked a better couple to play the parts of Elizabeth and Darcy; not only were Knightley and McFadyen's acting abilities flawless, but their compatibility on-screen was simply amazing. One reviewer even claimed, \\"[a]t the end of the mov[i]e they don't even kiss...\\" which is entirely wrong. In fact, it should be switched around; Elizabeth and Darcy aren't mentioned to have kissed in the novel, but kiss at the end of Wright's film. <br /> <br />Wright's adaptation of Austen's \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is not only original, but also highly romantic and enjoyable. For the most part it follows Austen's novel, but for the parts that it didn't, so what? It is it's own individual movie and is an `adaptation,' not an exact replica of the book; if it were, it would just be boring. I think that if people would stop comparing Wright's movie to how off it is from the book or other adaptations, viewers would actually enjoy and appreciate Wright's brilliant piece of work.
B000E33VWW|4.0|It seems to me that has of lately, actors that win the best actor award for the year, get it because of inimating people. In 2004, Jimmie Fox got the award of playing Ray Charles, and now Philip Seymour Hoffman has won the award for his imiation of Turman Capote. So who will get the award this year for imating a person? Now before the movie came out, I had never heard of Truman Capote, but I have heard of the 1961 movie that was based of one of the few books that he wrote, and that is Breakfast at Tiffany's. And now for this month and next month, is what I think is the best time to watch this movie, Capote died on August 25th, 1984, and he was born on September 30, 1924. And last year this movie was relased on what would have been his 81st birthday, had he still been living today. Now I know that Capote had a very unusal voice, and I have heard that Hoffman gets it pretty right, but what is the deal with his voice? If I talked like that, I might have been mistaken for a woman. In fact, was he just a woman that wanted to be a man? The movie starts with a woman finding her uncle and aunt dead, in a murder that is a mystery, since the family died alone, with a person living to tell what exactly happened. Now we meet Truman Capote (Philip Seymour Hoffman), at some sort of event, lauging and enjoying being in the company of friends. And soon he hears of the event, or maybe more sees a story about it, and decides to write about it, and he calls New Yorker editor William Shawn (Bob Balaban), and lets him know of his next idea for a book. He heads for Kansas to dig up reseach for the book, and on the airplane he meets Nelle Harper Lee (Catherine Keener), who becomes his assiant, she also would write her own book, and she titled it To Kill a Mockbingbird, and I have heard of the movie version of th book, and now I have to wonder if I should spend more time reading, even through I don't really consider myself a bookworm, but I don't think her book that all matters here. Oncehe arrives in Kansas, he starts his research, interviewing surving famiy members, and meets the 2 men Perry Smith (Clifton Collins Jr.) and Dick Hickock (Mark Pellegrino), who are held in a smale jail cell, and he forms a friendship with Perry Smith, and he takes in his request to have his side of the story held in a new trial, and promsises him to get him a new lawyer, he was senctended to death. There is also a lead investigator (Chris Cooper) and his wife (Amy Ryan). And even has Christmas sinner with them, when he gets a call that they got the 2 men they suspect that has to do with the killings. Evantally Capote decides to name his book In Cold Blood, and then you should know where it goes from here.        <br />

B0009UC810|5.0|If you want to get a taste of whatthe late 70's and early 80's were like, you must add this movie to your collection!  In the spirit of an adventure movie, the two heroes, played by Dan Aykroyd and the late John Belushi, are looking for money to save their old orphanage.  Along the way, they pay homage to some of the best rythmn and blues music of the 20th century.  With performances by notables like James Brown and Ray Charles, this movie can't be beat.  The movie is worth its price and then some for just the final half hour alone.  This is the \\"good version\\" not the cut-up one they play on TV all of the time.  R rating is more for the language and the cartoon-like violence, but is reasonably appropriate for age 13+.  There is no sexual content and, unlike most \\"comedies\\" today, there's not a fart joke to be found.

1591391105|4.0|Michael Watkins offers counsel that is relevant to so many, yet is actually a subject of study for so few. In my lifetime I have changed companies no less than four times. Job titles have changed twice than many times.     Preparing for and performing well during times of change accounts for a large part of my career. And I think I am not alone. For those looking for nuggets of assitance in their own transition, this book is for you. But Watkins research is new and still evolving to maturity. Look for more and better things to come from him in the future.

B000002UAX|5.0|In 'Forrest Gump,' Forrest's dying mother famously tells her dying son, \\"Life is like a box of chocolates--You never know what you'll get.\\"  Actually, if life were like a box of chocolates, you'd have a pretty sweet life.  And, while listening to 'The Beatles' ('White Album') you have an adequate fulfillment to that extended metaphor.  There are plenty of flavors--not just \\"Savoy Truffle\\"--and just enjoying the assortment is always an adventure--even if there are selected favorites.<br /><br />The 'White Album' is the most widely (and wildly) varied of all the Beatles' albums, but, while 'Revolver' is better integrated, the 'White Album' is a worthy treasure hunt worth repeating without getting tiresome.  Unlike any other Beatles' album, the 'White Album' showcases fine songs to get lost in; it remains a fresh experience that doesn't get familiar like most of their work.  The wildest and quietest songs of their repertoire are presented here.  It is in some ways their riskiest effort.  After the slickness of '67, the Beatles go back to rock n' roll without compromise this time around.  \\"Back in the USSR,\\" \\"Helter Skelter,\\" and \\"Birthday\\" are great propulsive songs, pay dirt.  They are wild in an innovative way that leaves their early years in the dust once again.  Then, \\"I Will,\\" showcases Paul at his tender best.  \\"Julia,\\" in the same vein, is John's haunting, yet quiet magnus opus.<br /><br />There is also uncompromising social commentary.  Musically and lyrically, John is seldom in finer form than on \\"Happiness Is a Warm Gun,\\" a brilliant barb against the NRA, with stunning commentary, no matter what side you take with the U.S.'s Second Amendment.  Then, if the music doesn't pierce the lush mood of 'Sgt. Pepper,' and 1967, et al., \\"Yer Blues\\" and \\"Glass Onion\\" will.  Both show John at his most fearless.  (The former mocks the blues craze, especially in England, and the latter faithlessly mocks fans giving too close readings of Beatles' songs.)  George Harrison isusually left out of the social commentary praises, but he is most direct with \\"Piggies,\\" a diatribe against the aristocracy, oddly never presented elsewhere.  While spare musically and a bit too simplistic, it is an unflinching piece of criticism.  Paul, too,  delivers an unusually eloquent ballad with \\"Blackbird,\\" a timely gesture to the Black community, the alienated--or both.<br /><br />Musically, the scope is grand with mesmerizing pieces throughout the mix.  John's \\"Dear Prudence\\" is fascinating how lyrically and musically it wooes its subject matter.  Then, \\"Sexy Sadie\\" is as hypnotic as it is scathing.  \\"Everybody's Got Something to Hide (Except Me and My Monkey)\\" also proves that he had a hard time getting the Maharishi off his back.  It provides a catchy, multi-layered fast-forward presence, even if the bitter gall continues throughout.  Paul's \\"Mother Nature's Son,\\" and \\"Martha My Dear\\" are beautifully engaging.  Perhaps the most hypnotic song of all is George's \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\".  Containing great guitar, people either find it mesmerizing or monotonous, but this reviewer considers it a classic.<br /><br />When there aren't diatribes or love songs, then stories are perennially present.  Paul ably gives us a fine Western with \\"Rocky Racoon,\\" featuring one of the best endings of any Beatles' song.  This spirited and fun song is at least musically bettered with \\"Ob-la-di, Ob-la-da,\\" a spunky tune that skillfully gathers the music and spirit of the Spanish community together. (All done for the best subject matter they ever mastered, love.)  Paul gives us another playful story-song with \\"Honey Pie,\\" arguably his best rendering of the Vaudeville era.  It is cutesy, but substantial.  In similar fashion, John hasn't lost all his fun-spiritedness as illustrated with \\"The Continuing Story of Bungalow Bill,\\" even if it is a barbed assault on another gun-toting character.  Also, his \\"Cry, Baby, Cry\\" seems like an original piece of Lewis Carroll, meant tochide someone off her pedestal.  If playfulness is what you wish from this assortment, then George's \\"Savoy Truffle\\" may be your just dessert.  With a hip jazz accompaniment, this dancey number provides a spoon full of sugar, even as it metaphorically relates warnings of bad karma.<br /><br />The variety is stunning, and the production is classic.  The sounds are the most modern and least dated of any Beatles' album.  It goes back to basics without returning to former destinations.  Subjectively, the alleged weaknesses reinforce the album.  \\"Revolution 9\\" may be dated topically in some ways, but you seldom hear anything like it before or since.  This fearless montage is innovative and interesting.  Some of the tiny songs are fun, too.  \\"Why Don't We Do It in the Road,\\" \\"Wild Honey Pie,\\" and \\"Revolution 1\\" broaden the already wide scope of the album.  They are also irreverent.  As if not to take themselves too seriously or the remarkable achievements of this classic album, they close with an overtly sentimental standard:  their own original \\"Good Night,\\" cleverly given to Ringo.  (Even he scores his first full-length original composition, \\"Don't Pass Me By,\\" a likable ditty that reminds us he was a prize acquisition from Rory Storm and the Hurricanes, a country rock group.)  Some of the strongest singing performances are also presented on the 'White Album'.  Paul delivers some of his strongest singing on \\"Birthday\\" and \\"Helter Skelter\\".  John is seldom better than on \\"Yer Blues\\" and \\"I'm So Tired\\".  George raises hair on the neck on \\"Long, Long, Long\\".<br /><br />Ironically, initial criticism (from even the producer, George Martin, no less) stated the double album was good, but uneven, and could have been condensed into a one-disc masterpiece.  (That would have ruined the fun, but produced a lot of mystery and bootlegs.) Oddly, the self-titled Beatles' album has more songs without all four present.  Yet, the album is aptly named.  Each composer is the maestro with aplethera of support from (willing) and able members of the band or special guest stars as desired or needed. It is a testament to the breakdown of the group:  Paul is pop perfect with an encyclopedic splendour; John is ingeniously powerful for not suffering foolishness gladly.  The sand of controversy provided this great pearl. Each copy has a new number to accentuate that it is a work of art.  This confidence is understandable.  Like 'Let It Be,' this album gets back to basics, but instead of being put on the back burner, it is put to the forefront with the Beatles' name prominent like no place else.  Even if you don't like all the flavors presented, the experience is always worth repeating.<br /><br />(Perhaps it is unnecessary, but it seems odd that Charles Manson would grasp subliminal messages of violent overthrow from this album.  Certain drugs are particularly dangerous for some, and his rendering of \\"Helter Skelter,\\" which in context is really about a wild and sexy party, is symptomatic of the occasionally regrettable universality of the Beatles' music.  He should have interpreted that John was being literal about guns, and his disdain for knives couldn't be extrapolated differently.  No where did George come close to suggesting the French Revolution in \\"Piggies,\\" but that is the closest Manson gets to hitting the songs right.  Well, enough about him.)
B00004R7TP|5.0|I first heard Kate Bush on MTV late at night when they played the video for \\"running up that hill\\". I remember the host saying \\"it's an aquired taste, but once you aquire it what a taste it is\\". I then went out and bought the album, and figured out it was her on Peter Gabriel's \\"games without frontiers\\". Album is great, have the origonal on CD and tape hoping I will get this new issue soon. The sensual world is also stellar. Great music for those with a romatic spirit and who like music that does not fit into any one category.
0670034711|5.0|I rarely review, but I enjoyed this book so much I just wanted to pass along my perceptions of Gilbert's work in case someone else was interested in the book.  I purchased and read this book for a book club.  Though I was vaguely aware of the plot and heard one member's accolades (which I partially dismissed, to be honest, because she knows the author!), I honestly didn't expect to enjoy it very much.  Travel books or travel memoirs aren't something I normally pick up for pleasure reading...but this was so much more than a \\"travel book.\\"    I am pleased to report that it was one of the best books I've read in a while, and I've happily passed it on to two friends who also both enjoyed it immensely...and I intend to keep recommending it!    The premise for the book was innovative and refreshing in its unique narrative pschoanalytic-feel (I know that's a terrible description, but it was so much more than a travel memoir, yet not only a case study in self-reflection).  A non-fiction travel \\"diary\\", but written with a true storyteller's talent.  There were several times in the book where Gilbert's choice of words gave me pause, and on more than one occasion, I happily reread a paragraph because of the way she poetically expressed an incredibly intense or honest moment.  I felt like I was reading a diary, yet was given a metaphorical context for these special moments so that I, too, searched myself for a way to acheive the balance and self-fulfillment that Gilbert strives for throughout her year of travel. I do not know if this was her intention at the outset of writing this novel, but after reading some of the other reviews here, I think we are looking at a truly gifted writer who has touched many readers in this way.    I was fascinated by the amazing opportunity this one woman had to explore three completely different places, cultures, and people in her effort to learn more about herself.  True, the basis for this story and all of its enjoyable sub-narratives were purely self-motivated--a direct result of her blunt self-reporting while she comes to terms with major issues in her life...for her own sake.  True, the book contract funding her travels and then the neat conclusions she acheives in each location have the potential to be viewed as trite.  But I don't agree with the few curse reviews included here about Gilbert being completely self-absorbed and shallow.  To the contrary, I am extremely envious that there is someone out there as talented and gutsy as she is (who so eloquently put into words such a personal journey)...and I don't know her!!  To my knowledge, she doesn't insinuate that the purpose of her book is to act as a travel guide for people wanting to visit Italy, India, or Bali.  She doesn't tout her personal journey as a how-to guide for spiritual enlightenment, though her honest narratives are clearly meant for readers to follow her through her personal experience.  She doesn't profess to know any of the answers in a context beyond her personal realm.  She doesn't dissent into long, tedious tirades about politics or unrelated details of her life (though the few political quips she does include highlight her sense of humor and sarcastic wittiness...not an ulterior motive for fooling people into reading a subversive political text, as some have insinuated in these reviews).  But Gilbert's witty prose and uncanny perceptions as she embarks upon these three journeys and wades through her new \\"lives\\" with humorous and sometimes painful revelations make for an enjoyable read. I highly recommend it!
B0006399FS|4.0|One still wishes that Bono and the boys had embraced more of their experimental side a la \\"The Unforgettable Fire\\" and \\"Zooropa\\"; on the other hand, this is a largely stellar effort, with a more stripped-down sound and more instinctive songwriting than its overblown, over-commercial predecessor, \\"All You Can't Leave Behind\\".
B0007VZ9DK|5.0|I've been biting at the heels to write a review of this brilliant film but, as I was when debating my Godfather review, I was hesitant for I know I could never do the movie justice.  First off, major props go to Scorsese for his brilliant direction.  It still ticks me off he hasn't won an Oscar yet.  Anyways, the film also sports brilliant acting on the parts of De Niro, Pesci and Stone, Stone standing out and nabbing the Oscar nom (and should have been win!) <br /> <br />The film (based off true-crime novel 'Casino: Love and Honor in Las Vegas' by Nicholas Pileggi) follows friends Sam and Nicky as they work the Las Vegas gambling scene.  De Niro plays Sam 'Ace' Rothstien (based on real life gangster Frank \\"Lefty\\" Rosenthal) a man assigned by the mafia to run a casino in Las Vegas.  The first hour of the film plays like a documentary, run over with voice over explaining the mafia's involvement with gambling in the casinos.  Sam meets and falls for the sassy Ginger (Stone) who marries him mostly for money.  Sam, kind hearted as he is, actually trusts her, and this proves to be his end in many ways.  Pesci plays Nicky Santoro, Sam's backstabbing pistol of a friend, short, round and confident.  Pesci always plays the short tempered \\"I can't believe a guy his size would pick that battle\\" type character...and he always pulls it off. <br /> <br />Over the course of the three-hour epic you watch as not only Sam's marriage and status but also the mafia's control of the gambling scene is jeopardized by events involving Sam, Nicky and Ginger.  This is a brilliant film that to me rises above 'Goodfellas' for it's as serious as it is intriguing and it never once begins to bore.
B0009W5K0Y|3.0|I really had high hopes for this CD.  I really did.  After hearing Emergency a few times I was hooked and decided to buy the CD.  I wasn't looking for anything revolutionary, or even anything unique.  I just wanted something catchy.  Plus, the sticker on the jewel case said that it was like Jimmy Eat World with female vocals so I was totally on board.   <br /> <br />Well, I guess it is sorta catchy, but the Jimmy Eat World parallel is a big stretch to me. <br /> <br />In a nutshell the album is ok.  After a couple listens a few songs start to stand out, but there was nothing about this release that I fell in love with.  The vocalist's voice is strong, though I don't think it is particuarly great.  The same is true for the guitar parts; pretty solid chord patterns with a riff here and there but nothing too exciting.  There is a lot of monotony at first, but this wears out after getting familiar with the songs. <br /> <br />Don't get me wrong, it isn't bad, just nothing to rave about.  Considering it is a young band, there is a lot of potential, and I don't regret the purchase.  It will be in light rotation in my CD player, but probably nothing more.
B0001ADB8C|5.0|First of all, I really appreciate George Harrison.  By all accounts, he was always trying to live, do and be right.  His music is a testimony to this.  Few other real rock stars are singing songs about life in God (or god...he sings about both).   <br /> <br />The Dark Horse Years is a great way to find out who George was within his music.  Honestly, much of this music is plagued with an 80's sound...but that doesn't, for me at least, negate the songs lyrically or musically.  In spite the 80's sound, George Harrison's rarely acknowleged talent comes bursting through on every song.  \\"Gone Troppo\\" is my favorite of the albums within this set.  George sounds like he feels good on this album.  You can hear it.  All other albums in this set are very enjoyable.  The videos are good,too, and you get to hear George discuss how some of his songs came about. <br /> <br /> <br />The \\"Live in Japan\\" cd is excellent and fresh.  Eric Clapton and George Harrison are a truly powerful duo.  You also get to witness some of this on the video. <br /> <br />If you are a die-hard Beatle fan, The Dark Horse Years is for you.  Ringo is on many songs, too.   <br /> <br />One of the best things about this set of music is that it is the actual albums for these years.   Songs are presented on each album in the order they were originally meant to be heard or in the order we are used to hearing them.  Why aren't more artist compilations like this? <br /> <br />2 other albums that are essential to round out the George Harrison collection: \\"All Things Must Pass\\" and \\"Living In a Material World.\\"
B000002BYD|4.0|This has been calling to me for 8 years. I feel that there's some reason although I'm not sure why, so I had to play it through to gain some answers. Spiritually for me in 1998 was anything, but easy. I turned 30, and now things weren't as simple. I struggled with singleness, work was starting to become terrible, and church only cared about me doing ministry work, and not helping me grow as a person, or helping me with developing people skills, or anything like that, and so I began to go on benders of being fleshy, and then 2 months later rededicate myself to the Lord. I saw myself as a former shell of myself, and just saw that the group was going through the samw thing as it seemed that the lyrics of these songs had alot of Spirituality themes to them, and ranging from Buddhism, Evolution, New Age, and even Angels, and Church choirs. I can only answer that there was a song on here that I heard numerous times on WJRR 101.1 down here in Central Florida. I believe it's: \\"Low Light\\", and I just needed to get this out of my head. This otherwise is pretty good musically, but I do wonder why they had a minute silence on \\"All Those Yesterdays?\\" I don't know if this will free me finally, or not, but I figured anything's worth a try. This in a sense seems as though they were going to try anything as well.
0553213105|5.0|It is, to put it simply, unequalled.  Not many books come as close to perfection as this one does.  Flawless prose, crackling wit, good drama, fully developed characters and a perfect plotline make this the best novel in the English language.  You may argue with me if you wish, there is no other book that satisfies like this one.  Jane Austen was a woman for all time and she was a genius in every sense of the word.  She understood people.  We are blessed to have with us this remarkable work.  How did she pull it all off so beautifully?<br /><br />I do not write much because I think that you, dear reader, should get your hands on this one pronto and stop reading this brief, rather trite review that does not come anywhere close to revealing Ms. Austen's creativity.  I have returned to Longbourne, Netherfield and Pemberley several times in my life and will continue to do so.  If I have the good fortune to meet Ms. Austen in the after-life, I hope that she will give me an autograph.  Or at the very least, give me a nod in my direction.
B0007GAEGC|5.0|I saw the Celtic Woman by chance on channel 13.  I was so mesmerized with them and I therefore stayed focus on the show until it was really over. Shortly after, I decided to buy both the DVD (and CD) that was a coverage of their live concert.  The ladies captivated me not just because of their beautiful voices, but also because of their pretty faces, lovely gowns and last but not least the talent of two of the ladies in playing the violin and harp with such a passion. Watching one of them play the violin with vigorous but graceful and expressive body movements held me spellbound. They appeared at Radio City here in New York and I wanted so much to watch them, but I had nobody to go with me.  Now my sister has discovered them too and she shares the same fascination for them and I look forward to attending one of their live concerts in the future with her.
1416524800|2.0|Initially this book grabs you with its developing storyline.  However, the author doesn't hold it together.  As you read, it becomes more and more obvious that the author did not really know what to do with his story or his characters.<br /><br />I finished the book, but it took some work on my part, because half way through the story telling of Mr. Brown does not hold up.  If I was the editor of this book, I would have sent Mr. Brown back to work on making it a complete<br /><br />book, and not coasting on its intesting beginning & premise!<br /><br />Its too bad, because it could have been a decent read.  I rated it a 2 on the overall premise of the story and the beginning.  All and all, I think Mr. Brown was just writing a movie script and not a book.
B000301YY8|1.0|My Goodness, the entire CD sounds the same.  Whiny and weak.  The best song on the entire album is \\"You're Beautiful\\" and it sucks!  The whole listening experience makes you want to drink liquid plumber.  I know many people are into Mr. Blunt, but not I said the cat.

B00005JNEI|2.0|I am not sure where to start with this movie, or this persuasive visually essay. After all, that is what it is. Anyone who states this movie is entire fact, despite political stripe, is really not being honest with himself or herself. Many of Michael Moore's arguments and positions on topics really follow a \\"1 + 1 = 3\\" formula. For instance Fahrenheit 9/11 opens with the Bush/Gore 2000 election. How different news channels weren't displaying solidarity with the results of the election. Then the film states how Bush stole Florida from Gore. How did Bush do this? Well his brother Jeb was the governor at the time, which is how! Now I am not saying that isn't shady, and I was living in Florida and voted in that election, I recall how crazy that entire process was. But you know how this entire situation could have been avoided? If Al Gore won Tennessee (his home state) and Arkansas (President Bill Clinton's home state, after all Gore worked with him for eight years). Had Gore won these states, he wouldn't have had to worry about Florida! Nevertheless, jolly old Michael Moore omits these types of facts throughout the entire film. I know many people on the right side of the fence were upset with this movie and feel it shouldn't have been made. My response to that notion is \\"If you are that upset GOP, make your own movie.\\"<br /><br />As for President George W. Bush, I have a question. Is he the dumbest kid on the street or is he the devil himself? Because I find myself getting really confused, I am not sure how he can be both. I imagine someone who is really evil to be very intelligent, not to be stupid. Consequently, President Bush seems to be both, as ominous as Hitler, but as dumb as Porky Pig. I am confused, but I think that is the ruse behind Moore's mix message in this movie.<br /><br />I want it to be understood I don't think Bush is the brightest crayon in the box, but I don't think the fault of the world is his pratfall. It just isn't one person who makes decisions in government; any college level course will explain that information to you. There are many shadowy and dark figures in American politics that are both Republican and Democrat. These factors fall into every element of contemporary America.<br /><br />As for 9/11 itself, what a terrible thing to happen to any country, the fact it happened in New York City was unspeakable. I am able to say I had been to the WTC before and after the attack. Seeing the aftermath was quite moving, to think one of the greatest cites in the world became a target of hate and pain. As for the human-interest story about the solider that was killed and his mother coping, was touching. However, what about every soldier's family who had to deal with a death related to the War on Terror? Not just in this current war, but in every war that was ever fought? The bloody shirt technique was both moving and a low blow all at the same time. As I write this, I feel conflicted, but please remember that movie making has the magic of editing. Was that mother's pain fake, no? Was her son not a hero, of course he was. But every war has a casualty, which is why it is war. And for every mother, who is upset her son/daughter is involved with this war, there is another mother/father who is pleased her son/daughter is defending the United States. I think Michael Moore should have selected more than one family for his visually diatribe, what do you think?<br /><br />I suppose I understand Moore's plan, blame people here in the United States because after all if Al Gore were president we wouldn't have terrorists, right? If Al Gore were president we would all have better public schools, lower taxes and no crime, right?  Finally, if Al Gore were president there would be no plot against the United States, United Kingdom and other countries, in regards to blowing up public airlines? Right? Remember that the WTC was attacked back in 1993 by terrorists, when Bill Clinton was President. Just some food for thought.<br /><br />In modern times, we as a country should stand together and be a democracy, blaming each other and falling apart is giving terrorists what they want.  Especially with all the horror going on with issues around the world today. My greatest concern is this; once Bush is out of office are we still going to be blaming him? Or are we going to be moving forward? There are still some hard core GOP members who still hate Bill Clinton for things that are wrong in this country. Come on people.<br /><br />In conclusion, the moral of the story is don't believe everything you see on TV. This movie should be an inspiration for people everywhere to tap into their critical thinking skills. The problem with this country isn't Bush, Michael Moore or the War in the Middle East. It is that fact that more people are involved in voting for the next American Idol, not the next American President.ght. <br /> <br />In modern times, we as a country should stand together and be a democracy, blaming each other and falling apart is giving terrorists what they want.  Especially with all the horror going on with issues around the world today. My greatest concern is this; once Bush is out of office are we still going to be blaming him? Or are we going to be moving forward? There are still some hard core GOP members who still hate Bill Clinton for things that are wrong in this country. Come on people.  <br /> <br />In conclusion, the moral of the story is don't believe everything you see on TV.

B000G75AE8|5.0|The Summer of 2006 was the summer of metal. Bands such as Six Feet Under, Hatebreed, Lamb Of God, Mastodon among countless others all released new cds. I saw the Unholy Alliance Tour as well and that was something ill never forget. The summer also put out a new Slayer cd. While at first I thought something was missing, I listened to at least 50 times in the course of a three weeks. It marked the return of Dave Lombardo to drums, even though I though Paul Bostaph did a great job on the last few cds. I highly recommend this cd to any metal fans who are sick of the cookie cutting metal bands out there. It is the best metal album for 2006 and it might rank up there with one of the greatest cds of all time.

B000002552|5.0|this is one of my favorite bob dylan records...I really don't care where or how it was made, it's perfect. dylan's giddy free-associating no longer sounds like the facile ramblings of a clever english lit dropout; his imagination has matured, but still has its freshness. his voice is unaffected and spontaneous; he sounds as though he's comfortably out of the spotlight, free from the pressures of being his generation's guru, and the feeling of creative delight between dylan and the band is infectious.    the songs are filled with quirky, surreal western scenarios (john wesely harding has a similar theme but lacks the exuberance of these recordings), with a wide emotional range from mournful to silly. the narratives sound vaguely inspired by the spaghetti westerns of that time--they seem to describe what goes on in those oddball towns when clint eastwood leaves...     the melodies are interesting and somewhat different from dylan's usual songs--they sound as though they were composed collaboratively. the arrangements, although rough, are also very rich; the instrumental and vocal parts are more integrated than on most dylan albums. it is also refreshing and unusual to hear dylan actually sing along with his band during choruses. this creates a \\"one of the boys\\" tone to the recordings, as opposed to his usual lonely poet/messiah/comedian persona.   the band's cuts are great too, and although they were apparently made at a different time, they fit in perfectly. with dylan as their mentor (whether or not he was present) they sound better here than on most of their later recordings, where their scruffiness gets increasingly stifled by studio slickness.     the one puzzling deficiancy of this album is the ommission of \\"quinn the eskimo\\"-- this was perhaps the most well-known song from these sessions (it actually became a hit for manford mann), but I've only seen it on the \\"biograph\\" collection.

0393327655|5.0|Sam Harris asks the fundamental questions about religion's influence in world events today. Why do so many Americans still believe the Bible was written by God, Harris asks, when it's author demonstrates no knowledge of science and demands capital punishment for marital infidelity? And why do so many think Islam is a 'religion of peace' when its holiest book calls for death to unbelievers on almost every other page? But the most stunning arguments come in the latter half when Harris argues for a kind of spirituality based in reason, which could fill the void created by an 'end of faith' in traditional holy scriptures.
B000000ZKD|5.0|This is a truely great peice of work. One of my favourite instrumental albums, from my very favourite instrumental band.     VERY nice to listen too. The band members really worked their instruments nicely when puting this one together. If you like Abbey Road, you'll love this.
B000GFLKF8|5.0|You almost know when Denzel Washington is going to be one of the main actors, you've got a class act movie. But Clive Owen made this one. What a plot! What acting! I've seen the new James Bond in other movies, and I won't judge the new guy in the James Bond role, but I honestly think Clive Owen was the man for that one. Jodie Foster was her usual great self as well. Take my advice and see this one. It's well worth it.
1591396190|1.0|As opposed to many of the other reviewers we tried to use this process in a strategic marketing session with four teams in our company. THis was a frustrating and disappointing process!  First, the book is a trite misrepresentation of an ex post facto process that has been dismissed by professional researchers and analysts. You do NOT prove your theory by fitting the past into your \\"model of the future\\". They did NOT work with Southwest Airlines to make them successful. They looked for examples that fit their thesis and applied it to ones they knew were succssful. This is not academically honest nor is it a good way to predict the future. It is like using Neural Networks to make predictions - they are 100% accurate in predicting the past. <br />Second, our team got to the point that we \\"believe\\" we found an underserved market area and we have three options and a full list of targeted areas for discussion. Now, how in the world can this book or anyone else on my team or in our company give me any insight into which one of these will be accepted by a prospect? This book promotes the worst form of pedantic navel gazing and raises self-reference to an absurd level. If we held the answer we would not need the strategic marketing exercise. Continuing this charade does us all a disservice. I worked with and managed product marketers for years in high tech companies who had companies like IBM and Intel as our customers. They did not do pencil whipping exercises. They went out and talked to prospects and asked them what they needed. This is not a novel approach but this Blue Ocean strategy seems to think that validation comes at the end after lots of silly charting and analysis.  <br />This book will send you on a fools' errand. Buy it for your competition and hope that they follow it.
B000G75AE8|5.0|There is nobody like Slayer.  New metal bands get compared to them all of the time but they aren't Slayer.  Go see Slayer live and then you will understand.  They are a vanguard of metal and the benchmark that all others are compared to.  They are an institution, and their music is unique.  Even to this day with the onslaught and barrage of new metal there is no equal to Slayer.   <br /> <br />Christ Illusion is Slayer to the core and represents something from their entire catalogue.  However, they have added a couple of new twists here and there and they are very cool, but it's still Slayer at the core.     <br /> <br />There is no reason why you wouldn't but this cd if you are a fan of Slayer. Period. <br />
B0002KVUKM|3.0|The best way to watch this movie is in small doses.  Watch ten or fifteen minutes and then stop to watch something else.  If you watch it all in one shot, it is too overwealming.  This movie is mostly frosting with little cake.  If you watch in in more than one sitting, it is much more enjoyable and coherent.
B000GGSM7G|3.0|yes, my intro is also cut off.  three stars though is for the album--although i love the cure, this is not one of their best.  that being said, it does contain some real gems:  'birdmad girl' is one of my favorite cure songs, also 'the caterpillar,' 'piggy in the mirror' and the divine 'dressing up'
B000E1ZBGS|1.0|I love this story, but I have never seen it so badly portrayed.  Over half the dialogue was left out, and with it much of the plot.  If I hadn't known the story so well, I wouldn't have known what was going on half the time.  There was almost no character development, and all the wonderful wit and dry humor was either left out or played completely deadpan, as if either the director or the actors didn't understand what was being said.   <br /> <br />Don't waste your time with this one -- get the BBC or PBS versions instead.  Both were far superior.
B00004BZ0N|4.0|I don't wanna brag about my punk rock \\"bona fides\\", but, well, just to brag a little, I was acutally at the Clash concert where the cover picture for this album was taken (at the old New York Palladium, since demolished for a NYU dormitory!). Of course, this album hadn't come out yet, but at that concert, the Clash did many of the songs that were featured on this album, as well as the then better known songs from their first album. <br /> <br />London Calling became a classic and is rightly considered so today. Still, I don't know if i'd call it \\"punk\\". The Clash were already becoming poppier by this time, which is OK. This record showed a great variety of styles (as well as a good deal of pretensiousness that overcame a lot of punk groups as they got past their first album). The Clash could pull it off, tho, unlike many of their contemporaries. <br /> <br />The Clash was the first punk group I ever really \\"got into\\". I found their first record, when it was still available as an import-only, in the Discomat store in Grand Central Station way back in 1978, and, along with the Stooges \\"Funhouse\\" (then also only available as an import) changed my whole way of thinking about rock & roll music. I had finally found something in the whole wretched mess of 1970s music that I could listen to. While everyone else I knew was listening to Styx, Foreigner, Toto, Boston, ELP, Yes (!!!), and I was holding my nose and trying not to puke, along came The Clash and eventually that whole long-haired mascara stained music scene went crashing into well deserved oblivion. <br /> <br />Eventually, I came to like other groups (Wire, Gang of Four, Joy Division, Flipper, Mission of Burma and, especially, The Fall) better than the Clash, it  WAS the Clash that showed me the true path. I still consider the import version of their first album their true masterpiece. London Calling was very good, and for a while I listened to it constantly, and it is well worth buying. It is a studio album, but in a way it is such a summing up of that period, that it is almost like being there in person at a live event. Tho it is not dated, and it stands the test of time, it will still take you back to your teen age years (if you were a teenager in 1979). <br /> <br />BTW, the tickets for those historic Clash concerts at the Palladium cost about 10 bucks--including the teletron charges. I bought the tickets at the teletron at J&R Music world when it was still only a basement record shop, years before it became the super mega electronics and computer store it is today.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly had it all: spaceships, heroes, villains, and a heart to make you believe that you were living with nine remarkable and amazing individuals for the moment the show begins.  Each character brings with them a piece of the Captain that he had lost or forgotten, be it faith, love, heroics, or spirit.  Firefly is intelligent, funny, heartwarming, and most of all, believable.  It is a story like so many of ours, one that is just trying to get by in life with the only people that matter, family.  It is a work of art, ahead of its time, and a must have for anyone and everyone who enjoys wonderful tales of 'thrilling heroics.'
B0002W18MU|5.0|I feel weird buying Johnny Cash albums three years after his death, but his music is still very good. Ravaged by the approach of death, Cash's voice is still powerful despite the loss of depth and range. His lyrics are, if anything, better than they've ever been; much of that is of course directly related to the decidedly spiritual bent his music took near the end of his life. Though many of the songs on this album fill me with a sorrowful hollowness while listening; afterwards, as the music and words fade away, I feel uplifted. I've been listening to Johnny Cash all my life, and it wasn't until he was gone that I realized how much his music, whether it was lively or foreboding, pleased me tremendously. I miss him, but I've still got him.

B00003CXC7|5.0|Rear Window is one of Hitchcock's masterpieces. It's a simple, yet incredibly elaborate film that will make you laugh, excite you, and marvel about how hot Grace Kelly was. Everyone knows the plot of the movie for the most part; James Stewart plays L.B. \\"Jeff\\" Jeffries, a photographer confined to a wheelchair after suffering a broken leg. Apparently he hasn't heard of a TV, so he spends his days looking out the window at his neighbors. After a series of coincidences, he believes that his neighbor has killed his wife. With the help of his girlfriend Lisa (Kelly), detective/friend Doyle (Wendell Corey), and nurse Stella (Thelma Ritter) he begins to uncover the mystery. This movie is a few minutes shy of two hours and is never dull...For a movie like this, that definitely takes some talent. First of all, the movie keeps throwing curveballs at you which make you question whether his neighbor is innocent or guilty. But even watching it today, it's not cliched. The subject of the film alone is fascinating; Voyeurism. Everyone is a voyeur, so the whole idea of voyeurism (especially when placed on film) can be fascinating and it's really fascinating here. Hitchcock manages to keep the suspense going, while occasionally making you laugh. The scene where Lisa and Stella go down to dig up the flowerbed and Lisa eventually sneaks into the neighbors apartment are truly great moments. James Stewart delivers one of his best performances. Rear Window holds the #42 spot on the American Film Institute's Top 100. The only Hitchcock film it ranks below is Psycho. If you like thought-provoking, slow moving suspense films. Check out Rear Window. It's a masterpiece. <br /> <br />GRADE: A- <br />
0930289528|5.0|For all the people out there who haven't watched the movie, DON'T, read the comic and don't watch the movie. I watched the movie before reading the comic and i must admit that was a HUGE mistake. After reading the comic i understood why Alan Moore disowned the movie. i even read in some interview that he wanted his name off the book! he said he doesn't want to have anything related to the american comic book industry! shame! The movie was a DISGRACE to this beautiful work. Anyways this graphic novel is one of the greatest things u'll ever read in your life, specially if u are living in a place ruled by a totalitarian government. It is just GREAT.<br />Compared to the movie, it is very obvious how the movie amercanized the comic and the theme. You can see how much details they dropped off, and they are indeed very important details. I haven't read much for alan moore yet though i do plan to. I've read how this hardly this guy works to construct his characters his plot everything, he does real hard research and he has the ability to work on a single work for many many years just to get it out right. I recommend this to all comic book fans, enjoy it.
B00007GZR5|4.0|\\"What Dreams May Come\\" is based on a novel by Richard Matheson ('A Stir of Echoes'), stars Robin Williams ('Good Will Hunting'), and won the 1998 Academy Award for Best Visual Effects. That's a well deserved Oscar, because this film has some of the most beautiful visual effects and art direction I've ever seen put on screen before. Williams plays Chris Nielson who tells us how he met the love of his life, Annie (Annabella Sciorra, 'The Hand That Rocks the Cradle'). Chris and Annie get married and have two children...But their world is rocked when the two children die in a car accident. They return to their normal life, for the most part, but then Chris dies in a car accident leaving Annie alone. With a man named Albert (Cuba Gooding Jr.) to guide him, Chris begins to explore heaven which is of his own creation (he builds it from Annie's paintings); But then Annie commits suicide, which guarantees her eternal damnation in Hell. I know this sounds like a book/movie written by a religious fanatic, but this movie (and rightly so) doesn't even really touch down on the subject of religion. The movie, despite its beauty and wonderful performances, isn't a masterpiece. As far as visuals, it is for sure...But the story tends to drag and become dull. Williams and Sciorra hit all the right notes as the devastated couple and Gooding Jr. gives a joyous performance. Max Von Sydow ('Needful Things') is also great as The Tracker who helps lead Chris into Hell to find Annie. The movie's got a beautiful story and a wonderful (if not melancholy) ending, but it's more to be appreciated than enjoyed. <br /> <br />GRADE: B  <br />
B00005JOYM|4.0|This is a movie for those who want to see it.  If you don't want to see it, don't go.  If you do want to see it, by all means, do go.   <br /> <br />The events of September 11 '01 are seared into my consciousness.  It is appropriate that this film is being released now, in August, on the eve of the 5th anniversary of the World Trade Center disaster, to give us as a nation an opportunity to pause and reflect on the horrific tragedies of that day.   <br /> <br />I went to the movie with some emotional trepidation; indeed, I re-lived the deeply gut-wrenching feelings all over again during the first 20 minutes of the film.  But the movie did not bludgeon my emotions.  I felt allowed to feel my feelings and to experience the day again, this time through the eyes of those who lived the tragedy from within the event. <br /> <br />Two themes stood out very clearly:   <br /> <br />1)  I couldn't help but think, every minute I watched, of all those who did NOT live to go home from that day.  Although the names of the Port Authority workers who did not survive September 11th were shown in the closing credits, I found myself wishing the filmmakers had also gone on to show the names of all the nearly 3,000 persons who perished that day, as well.  It would have been a small but very meaningful and appropriate addition in this case (heck, credits are long enough these days, anyway -- why NOT add these names, too?). <br /> <br />2)  The celebration, the triumph, the strength, and the unity of the human spirit.  If we'd forgotten it before then, the events of September 11 '01 certainly reminded us how lucky we are to have each other.  This film does a nice job portraying that sentiment -- not overdone. <br /> <br />I smell Oscars.  I hope.
B000GFLKF8|5.0|Remember when Woody Allen released Match Point last year and instantly revamped his career, probably because the whole tone of the film had changed from his previous efforts. Here Spike Lee basically does that; He's not revamping his career, because it's been fine...But this movie has a whole different tone from Lee's previous films. And that's a good thing, because this is a very smart film that throws constant plot twists while always staying true to what's going on. Bank robbing movies are hard to do now a days. Not movies about bank robbers who rob banks occasionally in the movie (Bandits); I'm talking full-on entire movie in the bank, bank robbing movies. Back in the 70's \\"Dog Day Afternoon\\" pretty much wrote the book on those kinds of movies and how they should be; I don't think that films been topped. But this film (which also does something out of the ordinary in referencing bank robbing movies such as the aformentioned one) does something different with the bank robbery genre. The movie opens like the Johnny Depp film The Libertine did. A character, in this case Dalton Russel (Clive Owen), stares directly into the camera and explains that he's going to rob a bank for two reasons. One, because of the financial aspect and two, because he can. In the next few moments we watch a team of bank robbers, wearing masks and disguised as painters, storm into a bank in New York and commence the robbery. As soon as the cops get wind of it, it turns into Dog Day Afternoon outside the banks sans the media and screaming fans. Leading the pack of hostage negotiators is Detective Keith Frazier (Denzel Washington), a smart detective who see's something isn't quite right with the robbery. Christopher Plummer co-stars as the CEO of the bank Arthur Case, who's hiding something in one of the safety desposit boxes; Jodie Foster co-stars as Madeleine, the woman hired by Case to keep the contents of the safety desposit box secret; And Willem Dafoe stars as Captain John Darius, another cop involved in the hostage situation. The ending is really smartly done and believable in the context of the film. This is entertaining, smart, and very good. <br /> <br />GRADE: A- <br />
B000G8NXYG|5.0|Normally I wouldn't mind someone's personal review, no matter how much they do or don't like a movie, but regarding user LF's review from August 3rd, 2006 I just can't help it. <br /> <br />In short: You'd be best to ignore pretty much all of his critique since it's almost entirely incorrect. Save for his personal opinion of liking Clint Eastwood's \\"Unforgiven\\" better than Kurosawa's \\"Seven Samurai\\" (Which is offensive enough as it is. Especially considering that Clint Eastwood is a huge Kurosawa fan himself, and that Clint's first big breakthrough was in Sergio Leone's excellent remake of Kurosawa's Yojimbo, \\"A Fistful of Dollars\\". Not to mention comparing \\"Unforgiven\\" to \\"Seven Samurai\\" is like comparing Shakespeare to Stephen King.) Everything else he wrote is just factually wrong: <br /> <br />-The plot synopsis on Amazon IS correct. Toshiro Mifune does play a farmer's son turned informal Samurai. LF is confusing Toshiro Mifune with other Kurosawa-regular Takashi Shimura, who does play the lead samurai, as LF bizarrely describes the \\"Odysseus\\" character, a characterization that is completely incorrect and doesn't even make sense.  As far as his comparison of Shimura (who he thinks is Mifune) not being as good as Brando... Well, Humphrey Bogart wasn't Brando, neither was Richard Burton, Al Pacino or any other actor. And those actors weren't Toshiro Mifune. Comparing actors to one another is pointless. Especially given the difference in nationalities and cultures, not to mention acting styles, and how superb both Mifune and Brando are on their own. <br />-Seven Samurai is NOT based on the Japanese book Musashi. The movie that is based on Musashi is Samurai 1, by Hiroshi Inagaki, which came out the same year as Seven Samurai, 1954.  <br />-His description of the women having \\"no role\\" is an ignorant remark to make regarding the female characters in the movie.  Newsflash, the role of women in feudal Japan was not particularly flattering.  On top of which, the character of the daughter specifically deals with that very issue: inequality between men and women, and how women are viewed as servant property that is to be treated like a commodity. To which, the daughter's character is certainly not a \\"Love interest\\" as he describes.  <br /> <br /> <br />Anyway, everyone's entitled to their own opinion, so long as they actually use facts that make sense. If you are reading this review and haven't seen Seven Samurai, you really have no reason not to.  It's all been covered before, by casual viewers and critics alike. Read the reviews, here and elsewhere. This movie, and Kurosawa along with it, deserve every bit of praise they regularly get. For good reason. No director, save for the likes of Jean-Luc Godard and John Huston was as consistent, prolific, and influential as Kurosawa. This is filmmaking at it's emotional and dramatic core. If you can't find \\"emotional power\\" in Kurosawa's movies, I don't really know how one can find it in ANY movies. And anyone who says this movie is \\"too long\\" belongs in the category with those that thought Mozart used \\"too many notes\\". This new Criterion edition should be hitting it out of the park. Especially considering the fine job Criterion has been doing lately. The new packaging, extras, and most of all the new transfer have me counting the days til it's release! It's gonna be worth every penny.
B000FVQM2Y|5.0|Writer/Director Rian Johnson's \\"Brick\\" is a film-noir, detective movie that is incredibly elabortate, surreal, and filled with really good-30s like dialogue. It's like a classic Humphrey Bogart movie, except with high school kids. Needless to say, not everyone will like it. When we meet Brendan Frye (Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who proved he could really act in Manic) he's looking at the dead body of a girl. The story jumps back two days and we see this same girls hand slip a note inside a locker. The locker belongs to Brendan of course and the note gives him direction to go to a certain payphone and wait. When it rings, it's his ex-girlfriend Emily (Emilie De Ravin, 'The Hills Have Eyes')...Sounding distraught, she rambles on for a few minutes; Saying she's scared and asking for help, but then a car drives by causing her to hang up and flee. After doing some investigating, Brendan finally meets up with Emily who asks him to forget about it. The next day, she's dead. As Brendan searches for the culprit, with the help of his friend Brain (Matt O'Leary), he winds up in a surreal whirlwind of drugs, deceit, and murder. Overall, it sounds like pretty standard stuff...But it's a lot more elaborate than that. Making a \\"whodunit\\" movie nowadays is hard; It's been done so many times, that you can pretty much see every twist a mile away. That's not so with this film. The plot twists are piled on heavily and you don't know \\"whodunit\\" until the very end, but this movie doesn't rest its fate in the hands of whodunit. What happens as Brendan tries to figure out what's going on is actually really entertaining to. As I said, the dialogue is very Bogart-like; <br />Coming from high-school kids (although Levitt's 26 and De Ravin is in her twenties I think) dialogue like this should seem campy and unrealistic, but it works. Even the stuff in this movie that seems overly campy (there's a character named The Pin, a big time drug runner who's got a hired muscle named Tug; Both of whom are a big part of the story) works perfectly in the way this film is made. This movie is very elaborate, so pay close attention to it. The cinematography and the gloomy mood the film has is great. If you're into interesting and elaborate films (this movies does remind me of The Machinist a little bit. Only because of the cinematography and the music; The story has no similarities) then definitely see this movie.  <br /> <br />GRADE: A- <br />
B00005JOYM|2.0|There's no denying that September 11, 2001 was a dark, dark day, marked by needless violence and untimely deaths. I don't have a problem with a film being made out of it as long as it's respectful and unbiased. Oliver Stone has repeatedly said that he made \\"World Trade Center\\" with no political agenda in mind, and before seeing the movie, I was willing to believe him. Call me naive, but I just didn't think it possible for someone to be that disrespectful. Then I actually saw the film, and the truth of the matter came to light. It's overwhelmingly political, unfairly toying with the emotions of the audience by presenting a feel-good survival story. This is a preachy, cliche-ridden, melodramatic film, and it tugs at our heartstrings without any degree of integrity. <br /> <br />This is the second film of the year to document the 9/11 attacks, the first being Paul Greengrass' \\"United 93.\\" That was a much better film, presenting the facts in a straightforward way without relying on heavy emotion or big name actors. It didn't make a political statement; it just focused on the action, confusion, and chaos. The best thing about it was the way it ended; it didn't linger on the tragedy of the crash by showing depressing images of burning wreckage. We didn't even see the moment of impact. That was the absolute right way to go because the ultimate fate of the passengers is well established. Why prolong the sorrow by actually showing the end result? It was almost like documentary footage, and that was probably why it was such a fascinating film. <br /> <br />This is more than I can say for \\"World Trade Center,\\" which documents the real life Search and Rescue mission of Port Authority police officers John McLoughlin and Will Jimeno (played by Nicholas Cage and Michael Pena). While evacuating the North Tower of the World Trade Center, the building collapses, ultimately trapping them beneath thousands of tons of rubble. Remarkably, they survive (other team members were not so lucky). While lying in the wreckage, the two start a number of conversations, all of which inevitably lead to discussions of their wives, their children, and their attempts to stay alive. Haven't we heard this kind of dialogue before in other disaster movies? Did we really need to hear it all again in a film documenting a real disaster?  <br /> <br />I obviously don't know what the men actually said to each other that day, but I had a very hard time believing that anything said in this movie was accurate. Screenwriter Andrea Berloff loaded each line with cliches that only pass muster in sappy buddy flicks. I got so tired of hearing lines like, \\"We're gonna make it!\\" or \\"If you die, I die!\\" coming from Cage and Pena, and I definitely could have done without the, \\"Tell my wife I love her,\\" sermons. There was no originality to this dialogue whatsoever; it was as flat and unimpressive as something written by an amateur. Even the way specific characters interact made use of worn out storytelling methods; when McLoughlin's wife waits in the hospital for word of her husband's condition, she runs into another woman who feels guilty because she yelled at her son. It was the last form of communication they had before he entered the World Trade Center. How convenient; the two found each other just as the audience is hoping for McLoughlin's safe return. <br /> <br />McLoughlin, Jimeno, and their wives Donna and Alyssa (played by Maria Bello and Maggie Gyllenhaal) were involved with the film's production. Donna is quoted as saying, \\"We got involved because we felt it needed to be done accurately. We wanted to do the right thing and I think the filmmakers wanted to do the right thing too.\\" I wonder if she said this knowing just how far Stone wanted to go with the melodrama; at a certain point, Jimeno closes his eyes and sees the image of a blurry, heavily lit Jesus carrying a bottle of water. I found that incredibly inappropriate; an image like that only encourages a biased mode of thinking. <br /> <br />Interwoven with the scenes of McLoughlin and Jimeno are scenes of their wives. They're both understandably panicked; they know for sure that both men entered the towers, but for most of the film, they don't know whether or not they survived. They struggle with conflicting emotions, going back and forth from desperate to cautiously optimistic. As the day turns to evening and then to night, they both experience flashbacks. Of course, they remember the good moments, like frightened wives always do in films like this. There's the moment when McLoughlin teaches his son the right way to saw wood. There's the moment when Jimeno and Alyssa lie in bed discussing what they should name their next baby (Alyssa is five months pregnant during the film). There's even the moment when McLoughlin is on the roof and he accidentally bangs his hand with a hammer. He and Donna look at each other with classic spousal love: a perfect moment for the audience to feel even more upset than they already are. <br /> <br />And then there's Dave Karnes, a military officer played by Michael Shannon. When we first see him, he's in a church staring up at a cross while telling the pastor that he needs to go to Ground Zero and help. This is clearly a noble, courageous thing to do. I praise the real Dave Karnes for lending a hand; New York certainly needed all the help it could get. But I had many problems with the film Karnes. The fact that church was where he made a vow to \\"fight the enemy\\" was in no way subtle on Stone's part. You can't include a scene like that and then expect me to believe this movie has no political agenda. <br /> <br />I'm in no way denying the reality or the scope of that terrible day, nor am I denying the fact that \\"World Trade Center\\" portrays it with extreme poignancy. The problem is that every moment is so heavy handed that it manipulates the audience into submission. There are many scenes that are so touching that they overwhelm us, which in turn distracts us from realizing we're being played like harps. This is not a respectful reinterpretation of a true story; this is an over the top soap opera, made with the intention of turning the audience into weepy drones. September 11 was a national tragedy. If a film is going to be made about that day, it at least should show some decency; the last thing the victims' families need is to be robbed of their dignity. It's the last thing the American public needs.  <br /> <br />Too bad Oliver Stone didn't think of this when making \\"World Trade Center\\"; it's such a shallow film, coming off only as an excuse for unnecessary melodrama. I urge you not to waste your tears on it. It doesn't deserve praise, nor does it deserve respect. What it does deserve is a quick death at the box office.
0312323867|5.0|All I can say is WOW! There is no saying or words that can describe how much I love the Something series! I want Emily Giffin to continue on with Old and New..but I don't know if it's possible.  Who knows? Borrowed was such a great book, finished it within a few days picking it up every once in a while (by the way..I hate reading).  After reading Borrowed..I was in love and had to get Blue. I did..read the book in two sittings and ended it with a huge smile on my face! Eight million thumbs up for Emily Giffin and her Something series...Now I guess I'm off to buy Baby Proof. Hope there is another coming!
B00004BZ0N|5.0|I was a big fan of the Clash as a kid in the early 80s, but kind of forgot about them as my tastes grew and became more diverse.  Then for the hell of it I bought this CD about a year ago, and I haven't stopped listening to it.  It is truly a masterpiece, especially if you consider the era when it was recorded.  Buy one for yourself and buy one for a teenager - yours or someone elses.  Tell them to listen to it a couple of times.  This is what music should be.  99.9% of what is out there today will pale in comparison.

Buy it and you'll have pal's on paper. =D
B000BJS4SU|4.0|All praise for this album is well-deserved.  As a young blues fan, I must say its about time there was someone with REAL talent making REAL music in the 'pop' world. <br /> <br />This ablum was something of an impulse buy and I can't honestly remember what made me think that John Mayer had made something that I would find worth listening, but I have absolutely fallen in love with it. <br /> <br />I find it a little sad but not very suprising that no one has mentioned my favorite track on this album \\"Out of My Mind.\\"  I think it is a hidden gem.  After hearing the blues-rock sound of the first few songs, I was enjoying the album but not blown away.  But then he did it.  He made an authentic blues tune with smokey, soulful vocals and guitar leads that give it 100% credibility.  It absolutely blew me out of the water, and from there I was hooked.   <br /> <br />He also nailed his cover of \\"I got a Woman\\" and \\"Try\\" is a fitting ending to this album.  Not all of the songs were fantastic, but everything was at least good.  Definitely a great first effort, and I look forward to more albums in this style from him (here's hoping other artists follow suit!)
B000BTJDGC|5.0|The Exorcism of Emily Rose caught me off guard. I thought I was in for a thriller/horror movie with the same old Hollywood elements. Man, was I wrong.<br /><br />The Exorcism, of Emily Rose is a movie based on the real life story of Emily Rose, a young lady who headed off for college and ended up losing her mind or being possessed by Lucifer...you decide.<br /><br />All the elements of a great film are there: wonderful storytelling, incredible acting, good pacing, and entrancing visuals. Jennifer Carpenter (as Emily Rose) puts in one of the best acting performances I have seen in a while. I am headed to find more movies with Carpenter in them as I write. Laura Linney as Erin Bruner and Tom Wilkinson as Father Moore are strong as well.<br /><br />Make no mistake, the Exorcism of Emily Rose is not a horror movie, per se. But...it is very scary. I found this movie more unsettling than any horror movie I have watched this year, and I have watched many. The scene with Erin Bruner in her home was amazingly tense. Also note that there is no blood and gore in the film.<br /><br />This is not a film with average frights, as it may linger in the minds of even seasoned fright buffs. I went to bed after the film (I work second shift), rolled over to look at the alarm clock, and it read 2:59. It turned 3 AM as I looked. I had to get up and check all the doors in the house. I was truly creeped out.<br /><br />I guess the fright in the film comes from the fact that it could happen to any of us. It also comes from the unknown. Was Emily crazy?<br /><br />Anywho, I can't say enough good about this film. It is a court drama, a story about people you will care about, and one heck of a frightening and unsettling film that tackles huge questions about God and demons.<br /><br />Total Score (out of 100) = 89<br /><br />48 (out of 50).

B00005JOUM|3.0|Is INSIDE MAN supposed to be a mindlessly stimulating bank heist film? Or a thought-provoking take on urbanism, race, money, power, and history? Blending the two would've been a spectacular feat, but INSIDE MAN too often misses the mark or simply stretches credibility to the breaking point.<br /><br />The story starts like a basic heist flick but with a few subtle quirks. Clive Owen stars as bank robber genius Dalton Russell who takes over a bank in Manhattan, hostages and all. But why he's there is the big running question. He makes no move to dash in and out with the money, and seems content to sit and wait out the police.<br /><br />Enter Denzel Washington as Junior Detective Keith Frazer. Being a hostage negotiator, the detective decides to play by the book, waiting out Dalton's gang and making false promises of arriving buses and planes. But Detective Frazer soon realizes that something is amiss. Dalton is delaying everything, too. And none of the hostages have been killed, even when deadline demands come and go.<br /><br />Into the fray comes Christopher Plummer as Arthur Case, the banks founder. He has secrets in a safety deposit box that he'll do anything to keep secret. In rapid (and confusing) fashion, he contacts Madeline White (Jodi Foster, FLIGHTPLAN ), a woman who has contacts in high places and can usually get whatever a client wants. Bending the ear of the mayor, Ms. White gets on the inside with the police and secures a private meeting with Dalton, who quickly advises her that he's already opened Mr. Case's safety deposit box and retrieved ....<br /><br />Okay, I'm not going to let the cat out of the bag.<br /><br />Suffice to say there are good qualities about the film (thus my positive rating). The acting is spot-on perfect (from Willem Dafoe's grumpy street cop persona to Clive Owen's questionable bank robber status). Filming was exceptional with director Spike Lee incorporating the darkness inside the bank in contrast to the white masks of the hostage-takers/robbers (White masks? Hmm. Think he's trying to tell us something?) The movie's pace was satisfactory, too. It perhaps got bogged down in some of the overly-developed plot devices that were extraneous or outlandish (the cops would NEVER let a citizen -- Foster -- into the bank with armed suspects regardless of her contacts).<br /><br />There are also a lot of irritatingly undeveloped items. Most notably were Jodi Foster's character and the basis for Clive Owen's gang. There is no history surrounding Foster's character so we don't know how she got started in this business (whatever her \\"business\\" was) nor how Christopher Plummer's character knows how to get ahold of her. Clive Owen's gang must've been some sort of modern day Nurembergers, still tracking down Nazi and Nazi sympathizers, but why and where they came from remains a mystery throughout.<br /><br />In recent typical Hollywood fashion, the good guys aren't so good and the bad guys are better than all. Christopher Plummer plays the dark figure we so love to see him play that it is, unfortunately, almost a clich&eacute;. Denzel is the black detective trying to advance his career while at the same time battling prejudice within his own department (another clich&eacute;?).<br /><br />Still, it was fun to watch. The fact that there's really no bloodshed makes this bank heist film unique by current day standards. Most have explosions with bodies flying through the air and clip after clip after clip of ammo being loosed. Not here.<br /><br />If you've got a few hours to kill at home, you might consider plopping this into your DVD player and checking it out.

B00003JRCQ|1.0|This film makes you believe no attractive people could be found in England to play these parts. Besides the obvious lack of beauty throughout the film, it is boring, dull, and downright laughable at its production attempt. There is no musical score which is excrutiatingly noticeable - particularly during that ridiculous falling off the wall scene. My friend and I love Jane Austen and lap up all period pieces - but sat through this one at the artsy theatre in Atlanta in 1995 and couldn't stop snickering at how horribly done it was. The screenplay might have been a good adaptation of the Jane Austen novel, but this film was terribly executed. Maybe they have done some post-production to enhance it, but I doubt it and I can't bear to watch it again to find out. Do yourself a kindness and get the 6-hour Pride and Prejudice A&E version with Colin Firth - it is perfect. Or Emma with Gwyneth Paltrow or Sense & Sensibility with Emma Thompson - those are great. I keep waiting for A&E or Hollywood to remake this one - it needs help. Good luck getting through it. I hope you have some really good popcorn - and a lot of it.
0312323867|5.0|If you have read Something Borrowed you must read Something Blue. <br />This story explains Darcy's side and takes you on her journey to self discovery, peace and happiness. <br />Just like Something Borrowed, Something Blue is difficult to put down and one you find yourself reading through as quickly as possible just to find out what happens in the end! <br />An excellent read!
B000002UAU|5.0|A friend recently copied this album for me---(thank you, Kevin!).  I absolutely love it and wonder why I went so long w/o it.  \\"Getting Better\\" was a new find for me (a little dark, but at least the narrator changes his attitude: \\"man I was mean, but I'm changing my scene\\") along with \\"Fixing a Hole.\\"  \\"She's Leaving Home\\" is so sad--an empty-nest syndrome song while \\"Within You, Without You\\" is the pinnacle anti-self-absorption song.<br /><br />I never quite got the logic of \\"A Day in the Life,\\" so I looked it up on the Internet--a collage of newspaper headlines that had captured John's attention, a reference to a war movie he had starred in, and Paul's jaunty \\"woke up, fell out of bed,\\" interrupts the hypnotic, \\"I love to turn you on.\\"  One of the many things I really love about the Beatles is their ability to seamlessly integrate contrasting melodies into a single song.<br /><br />In early March, PBS Great Performances featured Paul McCartney playing many Beatles' hits (in addition to his solo work)--he was a real one-man band.  That man has music flowing out of his every pore.  He claims to never have had any formal musical training, and yet plays at least half a dozen instruments beautifully---must be nice.<br /><br />Anyhoo, great album.  Just reinforcing what everyone already knows---the Fab 4 rock; there's never been any band b/f or after them that has their collaborative magic.
B000FBGBPC|5.0|Apparently word on the street is that only knuckleheads and jocks listen to bands like 3DG, Staind, Breaking Benjamin, etc. If so then count me in because all of the above bands make me put my fist up like no other can! I love fast hard rockin music as much as the next knucklehead and guess what, on their second album, 3DG deliver the goods yet again.<br /><br />This and BB's \\"Phobia\\" are the latest hard rock albums that I've gotten lately and wow, these two are in constant rotation due to their ability to keep my fist in the air while also makin me put it down and just enjoy the softer parts. The album suffers in some parts, but for the most part it's all good. I know this is the worst review I've ever written but the songs explain themselves. One complaint is, that \\"Pain\\" should have been left off the album are been a hidden track or something because it doesn't really fit in the album very well. That's the weakest song on the album. How many copies of this album have the bonus track \\"Running Away\\"? I really like this song. Definitely the better one on the album. And what can I say, I love to turn up the volume on \\"Animal I Have Become\\" it's funky and rough, kinda like I love my women. Hahaha, just joshing ya guys. I do wish they hadn't changed their personal appearance but I'm glad their sound is the same and they still kick hard, unlike Papa Roach who is slowly going down the road of \\"slit-your-wrist wannabes\\" bands. DON'T GO TOWARDS THAT DIRECTION 3DG and BB, stay where you are, go back to the mohawks and stuff....ooh, Animal just came on pardon me while I blast it.<br /><br />BUY THIS ALBUM EVERYBODY! It's good!!!
B00005JLR2|5.0|A great kids movie and as far as I'm concerned a good movie for adults. I loved the book Treasure Island and I loved this movie for its animation, creativity, music, and especially the superb voice talent. Great movie for anyone. Also recommended: Black Cauldron-great visuals within the movie
B00006RCNW|5.0|Excellent show. You will be addicted by the middle of episode 2. There's no doubt you'll be using your strip club money to buy season 2-5 on DVD--it would be in your best interest.
B00005JL96|5.0|I loved the movie. Great music, and unique animation. The characters are very well developed and the voice talent was great. The girl who did Lilo's voice was very entertaining.
B000AAF1U4|1.0|I normally praise Disney's animated movies, but I've got to draw the line somewhere. I can't believe the average review for this movie was 41/2 stars. I found the characters in this movie annoying, even more annoying than that suv commercial where that guy walks out of his house and parachutes off the cliff. I urge you to buy Treasure Planet, any Disney Pixar film,Tarzan before this one.
B000001GK9|4.0|There are several approaches to this work, two of the most common are the objective, straight-laced interpretation and on the other hand, the emotionally draining, full on Late Romantic splendor type. The objective approach can be too severe and uninvolving, just check out Pierre Boulez. The Late Romantic approach can get too kitschy and Hollywood film music-esque, just check out Bernstein's final recording. However the best conductor can match the right passion with the right mental clarity. Does Karajan do that? Maybe, maybe not.     The Berlin Philharmonic recorded Mahler's Ninth live with Bernstein a few years prior to this performance. That Bernstein recording is terrific, very impassioned and moving but the playing is not perfect and the sound is scrawny, edgy, typical DG stuff from the 70's. Then the Berlin Philharmonic recorded with Karajan in the studio. Apparently Karajan was not satisfied enough and he went on to record the work live in concert just a couple of years later and here we have that recording. It is stunning in many ways, the orchestral balances, the richness of the orchestra, the tempo choices and the final five minutes of the adagio especially are better than any other version ever recorded. Such calm and beauty magnified by Karajan. The opening movement, Andante Comodo, also enfolds majestically with patience aplenty but no self-indulgence.    However the Rondo Burleske movement is not as rough and intense as it could have been and the most passionate parts of the adagio coast by without the heartbreaking involvement that Bernstein could bring to these moments.    Even though I am not a big fan of Mahler, I love to hear a great version of his Ninth and yes, this Karajan version ranks as a great one but I had hoped for more.
B000FIMG68|4.0|The best things about the DVD sets are the lack of commercials and being able to view episode after episode. Eveyone agrees that LOST lost some viewers interest because of the \\"4 new shows-4 reruns, 2 new shows, six reruns\\" that we suffered with during the season.  <br />In general, Season 2 was good, but the difference between Season 1 and 2 was that most episodes in season 1 were \\"stand alone\\" shows. Yes, they continued the mythology of the overall story, but most could be viewed with a reasonable beginning and end each week. Season 2's episodes not only did not have ends to each show, but usually left us hanging even more each week. I also really wonder how many of those little things that occur are going to actually be answered. Such as what did Jack put in his pocket when finding the skeletons in the cave? I'm hoping that continuity will win out over mystery at some point during the shows run.
B00000IQW5|4.0|Always is an entertaining movie that has a little in it for everyone?  Chick flick?  Sure, but with enough testerone pumping scenes and humor scattered throughout that guys will like it too.  The firefighting scenes at the end can have you at the end of your seat, and the general theme of the movie keeps you interested throughout. A good movie to pick up for movie night at the house or for friends coming over.
4893580914|5.0|You would be hard pressed to find a better beginning kanji book than \\"Basic Kanji Book Vol. 1.\\"  The combination of logical progression, constant reinforcement through exercises and activity, as well as a stern instance on using only hiragana and learned kanji makes for a powerful study tool.<br /><br />The first in a series, it takes you through 500 kanji giving you a solid basis in the written Japanese language.  Instead of selecting the kanji based on Japanese school levels, or other arbitrary standards, they are selected by pure usefulness in written and spoken Japanese.  The kanji are grouped by sections such as \\"kanji made from pictures\\" or \\"kanji for time,\\" with 12 kanji in each grouping.  Each section is laid out with writing practice, followed by review and reading comprehension practice.<br /><br />There are no gimmicks or fancy short cuts in \\"Basic Kanji Book Vol. 1.\\"  Just straight-forward, old-fashioned learning by use.  The constant reinforcement in each chapter is really the strong point, as each exercise compounds on previous chapters, allowing for true learning rather than just quick memorization.<br /><br />Before you tackle this book, you need to have a good grasp of hiragana and some katakana.  Like all good Japanese study texts, \\"Basic Kanji Book Vol. 1\\" makes no use of romaji so you learn the language directly from the language.  It can be a bit hard at first, but if you persevere you will be well beyond the level of learners who stuck to their training wheels.
0804115613|5.0|Flagg does an excellent job of making the connection between past and present appear seamless in this wonderful story of an unlikely friendship. <br /> <br />During the 1980s, Evelyn Couch coicidentally becomes friends with Ninny Threadgoode, a resident of the nursing home where her mother-in-law resides. Evelyn quickly finds that the elderly woman is full of rich stories about the past -- stories which begin to fill a void in the overweight, dissatisfied woman's life like nothing else. <br /> <br />Central to the stories is Idgie Threadgoode, Ninny's sister-in-law and owner of the Whistle Stop Cafe, where the townspeople often congregate. A tomboy since childhood, Idgie has a way of handling adversity which Evelyn admires and envies. As time progresses, she begins to imagine what Idgie might do in a particular situation, longing for this woman of yesteryear to be a part of her life as well. <br /> <br />Like all good things, nothing can be forever -- not the Threadgoodes, and not the rapidly-growing friendship between Evelyn and Ninny. This isn't to say, however, that even the smallest words and actions aren't capable of leaving the deepest impressions upon a person's heart and mind. <br /> <br />As always, Flagg has created an unforgettable work.
B000GTJT0W|2.0|Reference picture quality on HD-DVD.  Basically unwatchable though.  I would not recommend the blind buy on this one.
B000BC8STC|5.0|Some points:  Someone said the band was much better (than today's Soul Generals?) I strongly dsiagree. While they are good, I feel that his current band is his best and tightest ever. Also, the bonus tracks promised are on the PAL European editions.  It really is a shame that Amazon didn't check this out before falsely, albeit I'm sure unintentionally, advertising those tracks. The DVD is fantastic. TOO FUNKY has a guitar riff in it I have never heard before. The only drawback is, as usual, the stupid cameraman cuts to one of the band members just as Mr. Brown starts to do the mashed potatoes during 'Papa's Got A Brand New Bag'. This has happened to some degree in almost every concert James Brown video I have!! Most aggravating. Another somewhat annoying observation: the beginning song is RAPP PAYBACK, from 1980, not the original PAYBACK from 1974.  In the middle of the song, James goes into THE PAYBACK. How hard is it to do a bit of research before releasing a DVD??
B000006045|5.0|Having had no previous exposure to Massive Attack, I purchased this disc 5 years ago based on some outside reviews I read and I could not have been happier.    How to describe Mezzanine?  A mix of 60's soundtrack instrumentals with modern trip hop is the best way to describe it. I hope that helps.  I did purchase some other Massive Attack discs subsequently and quickly realized this was the one that put it all together.  I would recommend this one to any music fan and say that while the other Massive Attack discs have their moments Mezzanine is the one you want and could probably skip the others, not because they are bad they just pale in comparison to Mezzanine.
B000FS9FCQ|4.0|V for Vendatta is a movie about terrorism, anarchism, vigilantes, corrupt governments, trading false security for liberty and many other politically charged ideas.<br /><br />The cinematography and acting are wonderful. The political messages are ultimately polarizing and confusing.<br /><br />The film tells the story of V, a man who has been tortured and experimented on by a near future totalitarian and corrupt British government. V is a superhero or supercriminal, depending on your perspective. He's really both. Was his soul stolen by the government or did he lose it wreaking his revenge throughout the course of the film?<br /><br />All of the main performers are over the top. V's prose throughout the film is wonderfully spellbinding. I found myself alternately loving and hating this man.<br /><br />Many of the political issues addressed by the film are very valid. Americans and Europeans are in the process of trading basic liberties for a false sense of security. Just ask anyone who has flown on a commerical flight recently how free they felt during the in-processing.<br /><br />However, the imagery and ideas presented in V for Vendetta are over the top and the problem solving methods used by V pure fantasy.<br /><br />The movie is nevertheless highly enjoyable. The important message contained within is that complacency is the recipe for loss of liberty. Interwoven throughout the movie are several love stories. Mostly though, the movie is about power, corruption, resistance and vengeance.
B00004BZ16|5.0|when i first listened to this album i have to admit that like most, i didn't completely get it. I had just recently heard the first three clash albums (my first real forray into classic punk) and immediately fell in love with them. this album however didn't grab me as quickly. well anyway after a few years of obsession with their early work i decided to give it one more try. this time i came prepared with 3-4 years of experience listening to the best in punk, blues, jazz, reggea, rockabilly and classic rock -- and more importantly a greater awareness of the socio-political world.  sandinista is one of the deepest and most engrossing concept albums ive ever had the pleasure of encountering, it paints a painfully accurate portrait of the continuing struggle between the upper and lower classes and the blood and tears it creates -  mainly for the latter, and of course throughout the album Mr. Strummer reminds us of the healing power that music and music alone has to bring us all together.  believe me its all in there -- a true masterpeice if ive ever heard one -- please give this album as much patience and openmindedness as you can, it will repay you a thousand fold. *****
B000G75AE8|4.0|For anyone who loves the thrashing of Reign in Blood with the guitar style of Seasons In the Abyss and God Hates Us All, well then this album is for you! <br /> <br />Flesh storm, Skeleton Christ, Eyes of the Insane, Catatonic, Consfearacy, Black Seranade, Cult, Supremist are by far my favorites. Slayer fail to disappoint.   <br /> <br />Although, Jihad (modern version of Angel of death) is the only song that has a better second half then the first half; Tom Araya rushes the lyrics as if he was running out of time on them and you need to read the lyrics to follow what he's saying. He makes up for it in the second half where you can really get into the musical groove and lyrics. The beginning has a weird musical start. It would have been killer if the song started off with something in reference to 9/11 (since this was based on 9/11) the way Eminem's song \\"Mosh\\" had the plane crash.  <br /> <br />Supremist, one of my fav songs, had weak sounding guitars to it. I wish it was a little heavier so that I could get into the groove a little more. Otherwise, good song/great lyrics. <br /> <br />Catalyst is the only song I'm not a fan of. <br /> <br />Too bad there were only 10 songs on this cd. Their lyrics are dark and guitars are fast and heavy; the perfect combination for any Slayer song/album. <br /> <br />I started listening to Slayer since Seasons and I have yet to hear a bad album. <br /> <br />I have to give it 4 1/2 because Jihad was rushed in the first half and guitars on supremist should have been a little stronger.  <br />
B000DZIGDU|4.0|Director: Sam Mendes <br />Cast:  Jake Gyllenhaal, Scott MacDonald, Peter Sarsgaard, Jamie Foxx, Lo Ming, Lucas Black, Kevin Foster, Brian Geraghty, Chris Cooper. <br />Running Time: 123 minutes <br />Rated R for Rated R for pervasive language, some violent images and strong sexual content. <br /> <br />Jarhead, as many people know, is a slang term for a US Marine. One of those newly minted jarheads is Anthony Swofford (Jake Gyllenhaal) who, largely to even his own surprise, finds himself enduring the rigors of basic training and then still more brutal training for his assigned specialty. Swoff tells one drill sergeant that he's in the Marines only because he \\"took a wrong turn on the way to college.\\" His explanation doesn't go over well. Later, he does everything he can think of to drum himself out of the Corps. Eventually, between the friendship and support of his partner, Allen Troy (Peter Sarsgaard) and the tough example set by his commander, Staff Sergeant Sykes (Jamie Foxx), Swoff becomes very, very good at his new job: a scout sniper. Needless to say, when the news breaks that Saddam Hussein has invaded Kuwait, Swoff's group is one of the first to be sent overseas.  The troops are welcomed to the desert by Lt. Col Kazinski (Chris Cooper) who commands a large segment of the Marines deployed there, and who tells them they must maintain constant vigilance and be ready to fight at a moment's notice. But months go by with nothing to do but drills and more drills, and the boredom, anxiety, heat, and desolation of their circumstances begin to wear. The men, of course, find some very creative (and usually very naughty) ways to entertain themselves and each other during this time. But when war is at last declared, they move out like the professionals they've been trained to be.  In the midst of burning oil wells and charred vehicle convoys, Swoff and his company make their way into enemy territory. They endure enemy fire and fear; fights amongst themselves and utter despair. And then, as suddenly as it began, the war is over. But despite the brevity of Swoff's experience (his own fighting war lasts only a little over four days), he and everyone else is changed by their experiences, and not all of those changes are easy to live with. <br /> <br />\\"Jarhead\\" gives us the firsthand experience of one soldier in the Gulf War with all of the attendant good and bad moments. As such, it's fascinating in and of itself. But director Sam Mendes has added dramatically to the story with some truly brilliant edits, some creatively managed flashbacks, and some astounding settings (the burning oil wells are bizarrely heart breaking even as the depiction on screen is awesome; the destruction wreaked by American bombs is graphic and moving). Of course, the fact that the film is based on a book written by the real Anthony Swofford about his own experiences in the Gulf War means that even Hollywood effects can't take away from the back of our minds that much of what we see is real, or at least was.  Jake Gyllenhaal has become a very good actor indeed, and holds his own with Oscar(tm)-winner Jamie Foxx, whose performance could very well garner him another awards-season nod for his supporting role. Peter Sarsgaard is also just terrific.  \\"Jarhead\\" isn't a war movie per se in the sense that it shows a lot of shoot 'em up action, but it may be one of the few war movies that actually conveys graphically the sheer boredom and hurry-up-and-wait that is the reality for many soldiers.  That the men perform so well despite the emotional obstacles of where they are and what they might have to do, and that they're a cohesive group when it counts no matter the flaws of each or any of them, is unquestionably honored here.  Not quite up to the quality of director Sam Mendes's \\"American Beauty\\" and \\"Road to Perdition\\", but with his first three films, he has solidified himself as one of the most aggressive, intelligent, and thought-provoking filmmakers out there. <br />
B0007TKNII|2.0|This is a good story gone down the drain.  Many flaws in my opinion, which I'll get to later.  First, I think it would be best if I mentioned the things I DID like:    1) The music.  Despite occasional poor orchestrations, it was an enjoyment to listen to.    2) The art direction...gorgeous.    3) The lighting.  Simply resplendent.  (Not counting the Phantom's home, which I'd prefer to be darker.)      Now for the fun part...criticizm:    1) The casting of the main characters, especially that of Gerard Butler as the Phantom.  If you're a fan of Michael Crawford's portrayal as the Phantom, you'll most likely dispise this.  Butler can't sing OR act.      The rest of the cast was fairly annoying, (especially Simon Callow and Ciaran Hinds as the managers) but they were as deities in comparison to Butler.    2) The editing.  Where on earth is the entirety of the second \\"Letters\\" scene?  And why was the last part of the overture cut?    3) Movie mistakes...is it just me, or did the Phantom's hair go from brown to blonde at the end of the movie?  And how did Christine magically get dark eyeshadow on while going to the Phantom's home?    4) The choreography...so dysfunctional...    5) The costume design in the \\"Masquerade\\" scene.  Whatever happened to \\"Flash of mauve, splash of puce, fool and king, ghoul and goose...green and black, queen and priest, face of mule, face of beast...\\"  (Isn't that how it went???)  Almost all of the costumes were black, gold or white.  (Not to mention that the chorus was weak...)      So with all this, believe me...don't waste your time.      T.K., 14
B00008G9JM|4.0|Between \\"Thick as a Brick\\" and \\"Warchild\\" lays this obscure disc performed by the classic lineup of Ian Anderson (flute, acoustic guitars, saxophones, vocals), Martin Barre (electric guitar), Barriemore Barlow (drums, percussion), Jeffrey Hammond-Hammond (bass, vocals), and John Evans (keyboards, spoken words). The use of saxophone is prominent and a good change of pace for fans, however, this is not your typical Tull album, nor would it be good purchase for a newbie. As the liner notes state, this is \\"a slightly weird and instrumentally adventurous concoction\\". <br /> <br /> \\"A Passion Play\\" is one song broken up in two parts. It is quite a challenging listen and some of the spoken word sections are hard to digest, but if you give it time, you may find lots to enjoy. <br /> <br />
B0002W18MU|4.0|Normally, I am suspicious and skeptical of any posthumous recordings (see George Harrison). However, Rick Rubin's handling of \\"American V: A Hundred Highways\\" is agile. Rubin and Cash had a knack for song selection. In this case 10 of the 12 tracks are covers, though I wish Cash would have written more original songs in his late career because I like \\"Like The 309\\" and \\"I Came To Believe\\". I also always enjoy Cash's takes on traditional recordings like \\"God's Gonna Cut You Down\\". The only song I instantly recognized was Gordon Lightfoot's \\"If You Could Read My Mind\\", and Cash does a decent, if not hoarse, go of it. The poetry of some of the songs is brilliant as with \\"Love's Been Good To Me\\", \\"A Legend In My Time\\" and \\"Rose Of My Heart\\".<br /><br />I don't know what percentage of \\"A Hundred Highways\\" is Cash and what percentage is Rubin, but it's a fitting end to a notorious and illustrious career. I didn't give it five stars because I don't think it's the best of the American series, but it sure is good. No one can replace Cash, and I don't think we'll have another like him again.
B00006CXSS|5.0|I bought this item as a gift for my son and he is really enjoying it.  Making the purchase was easy and the shipment came in, in a timely manner.
B00005QDW5|5.0|Pink Floyd Echoes does indeed gather the best of Pink Floyd on two compact discs. Wow. How can you sum up such an astonishing carrer? Well, Echoes does a very good job, the only drawback (if you can call it that) is that it only has Another Brick in the Wall Part II and it would have been better if Parts I and III were put together in one song.
B000FBGBPC|5.0|As soon as I heard \\"i hate everything about you\\" i became hooked on three days grace and HAD to know more about them. That was when i stumbled upon \\"Animal I have become\\" on AOL music. I immediately fell in love with 3DG and Adam Gontier (hehe). After reading bart \\"wwfrockfan\\" 's review of the CD and listening to the samples on Amazon i knew i had to have this CD the next day! i've had it less than a full day and already i know all of the words to all the songs! this is by far the best CD i have ever heard!! the album \\"one-x\\" has many great hit songs on it that, in my opinion, are \\"radio worthy.\\" My personal favorties are \\"Animal I Have Become,\\" \\"riot,\\" and \\"its all over\\" for their harder rock feel. However, the slower songs, \\"get out alive\\" \\"over and over\\" and \\"time of dying\\" still have their metallic points in them which make them match the other songs on the CD. Between the varying topics discussed in the songs, the variety of musical sounds, and Adam Gontier's incredible lead vocals, this CD has something to offer everyone!
B00008BXJG|1.0|Come on now!! People need to shut up with Green Day. Green Day are the most overrated band of the world. The poplar bands are overrated. Gimme a break!!!!!!! <br /> <br />Highway to Hell is one of the worst albums besides Back In Black. <br />Their lead singer Bon Scott is angry, overrated, stupid, lousy, mean, and lame and he sure can't sing. They only made 1 listenable track in the title track of this album. Avoid <br />the rest of the AC/DC albums and get Metallica insted. <br />
0060578793|3.0|I bought this book with an interest in outdoor survival and picking this one out at the book store. Started off with bood points and it's bad points. Good points were the pictures of everything from edible plants to animal tracks. Some of the bad stuff was going against common sense. Like saying you should have a survival kit on your person while in an airplane in case of a crash. 2 of the most important things for survival would be a blade and a source of fire such as a lighter or matches, neither of which you can take on board an airplane. And when talking about polar travel and survival in talks about polar bears. It says respect them not don't go near them. It also says don't eat their liver...now if I just went through something that put me in the situation to be around polar bears in the artic regions, I don't think I would have anything I would challenge a polar bear. And if I killed one, the first thing I would say would surely be \\"I can't wait to get that liver!!!\\"
B00004Y6NV|5.0|Well folks, On Every Street is one of the most underrated and greatest albums ever created. Heavy Fuel is one of the best songs <br />ever! It's just as rocking as Sultans Of Swing, and Money For Nothing. Get all Dire Straits albums right now! They are the greatest along with Metallica.
0452270073|3.0|Pat Barker's novel \\"Regeneration\\" is an interesting account of the shell-shocked soldiers and poets of WWI. Her use of real people for the characters of the novel (Siegfried Sassoon, Robert Graves, Wilfred Owen, and others) adds versimilitude. She delves deeply into the meaning of the bizarre dreams and fantasies of the soldiers in a mental hospital and their reactions to their experiences in the war. The beginning of the book is strong and well written, but as it progress she tends more toward the bizarre and symbolic; particulary with Burns' condition.     This book focuses on the anti-war position of Sassoon, but I feel that \\"All Quiet on the Western Front\\" is a more successful anti-war story. This novel reeks of fiction despite the fact that she bases it on historical personages, and to some extent the horrors of the war seem manufactured, whereas in \\"All Quiet on the Western Front\\" the author experienced the war first hand and therefore his story is a much deeper account of such a fraught time in history.    I read \\"Regeneration\\" in an afternoon, and found it enjoyable, though the author's tendency towards the overly metaphorical was irritating. The best part of the book was the focus on WWI poetry and insights into the poetry through the characters in the novel.       - A.B.
B0000TLA9G|5.0|This GNR greatest hits is a great collection of music. Absolutely better than anything by Green Day. I absolutely think November Rain is one of the greatest songs ever created. You just need to get this right now...Metallica are great too. <br />
B000E41MS6|5.0|Its about time that Dr Who got a production studio with the ability to create some decent special effects.  It is also great that creators of this new series didn't rely soley on the new special effects, but stuck true to the Dr who plotlines and history.  They also capitalized on the Doctor's wit, humor, and compassion.  This is a must have for any true Doctor Who Fan.
B000002H97|5.0|Metallica are one of the greatest metal bands in history!!! <br />I just love this great album and it is a classic!! This legendary band made several great songs and this is my favorite which has great songs like My Friend of Misery. Buy this album right now...it's the greatest!!!
0671015206|5.0|We first heard about this book from our financial advisor.  After he mentioned it the second time, I became curious and decided to read it.  I found it very interesting, and I think you will, too.  If you want to be a millionaire, you may find it helpful.  If you want to look as if you are a millionaire, you will find it interesting, as well.  After reading it, the difference will be clear.
076531178X|5.0|So just a few minutes ago i finished Mistborn: the Final Empire by Brandon Sanderson, and wow was it a good read!!! Let me just say that Sandersons second book far surpasses the first. it is much faster paced, not to mention that the character development is great. The new magic systems he created for this book is very compelling, each is based around metals and alloys.  the dialog is great and the book has a plot twist or two that not even i, someone that can see most plot twists a mile away, expected. all in all it was a very good read, and i'd recommend it to anyone that enjoys the fantasy genera. seriously stop reading this review and buy this book now!!!
B000AP04FG|3.0|The movie Mr. and Mrs. Smith will always be remembered more for what happened off the set with Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie then what happened on screen. But since I don't deal with salacious news, I won't comment on any off the off screen happenings or the irony that the movie that stared Jennifer Aniston's future ex-husband also featured future (alleged) husband. Nope, not gonna talk about that kind of stuff. <br /> <br />The plot features something I'm sure more than a few people can relate to with a married couple in a stale marriage that is filled with lies, except their lies are a lot bigger than most couples in that they both are hired assassins. In the beginning we spend some time watching their mundane lives which is, well mundane to watch.  Movies about assassins should never be boring at any point. Seriously, is it that hard when you run into a down spot to just randomly have a cut scene with some dude getting off-ed in some creative way? <br /> <br />Another problem early in the film was the introduction of the Adam Brody from The O.C. as some random dude who seemed important and just disappeared. His storyline gets resolved late in the movie, but I spent the middle part wondering if I missed something. Also not given enough screen time was Vince Vaughn as ironically Pitt's buddy/co-worker. Another way they could have solved the mundane scenes was inject more Vaughn throughout the movie. At least he faired better compared to Jolie's buddies/co-workers who had less screen time and then had divide the time with four other actresses. How you don't exploit a group of female assassins in beyond me. <br /> <br />But with all those complaints, when the movie did kick into high gear it was gripping. Each action sequence is more jam packed then the next all peppered with the right amount of humor and violence. This is highlighted by when the Smiths go after each other in there own home. And when they both lose their weapons there, the battle only gets better because well, guns are for wusses; real men (or women) will beat you down with their hands. There is also a great car chase where with a soundtrack of oddly enough of Making Love Out of Nothing at All (which the person I watch it with wrongly tried to argue Meatloaf when I said it was Air Supply; a lesson to all, never question my knowledge of cheesy music). Mr. and Mrs. Smith may have some down points but at the very least it's a good waste of ninety minutes.
