1439153663|1.0|I love historical fiction; I really do. I was excited to read this book, but it was drudgery from beginning to end. I am still puzzled that so many people gave this book a five-star rating. This book is terribly written, with flat, undeveloped characters, absurd plot twists (rape! murder! lies! intrigue! incest! child abuse!), and unbelievable resolutions which feel like another vehicle to speed along the very predictable, very drawn out, but paper-thin plot. This novel is supposedly set in the late 18th century, but there is little in the book that shapes the time or place; some of the dialogue feels like it's right out of a soap opera. Too much happens; too much of it is negative; there are too many tragedies. None of the politics of the time (after all, the Revolutionary War just occurred) are mentioned. There is little that moors the reader in the historical period of the time. And, oh, yes, let's not forget the sloppy ending, which is supposed to resonate with bittersweet optimism but actually had me laughing out loud at its absurdity. I skimmed the last 30 or so pages because I just wanted to have this book done with. A huge thumbs down from me.
B0030L38PA|5.0|I know this book is getting a lot of mixed reviews, and I can understand why. However, I loved it. It reminded me a great deal of Young's \\"The Shack,\\" though darker and perhaps a bit more honest. It is also thought provoking in ways similar to the writings of C.S. Lewis, i.e. not terribly complicated writing, but deep. What I really loved about this book was the originality of it -- first of all, having the entire story narrated by a character who has already died, and secondly, of her idea of Heaven. While it is controversial in nature and I'm not sure I entirely agree with it, it was quite captivating to read of a Heaven in which the afterlife is NOT perfect, and a soul in Heaven still continues to grow and change even after death. I think this will cause most people to examine their own ideas about the afterlife and what they think it may be like. This, to me, was most fascinating about the book.    The only things I didn't like about the book were the sometimes tedious descriptions (Ms. Sebold paints beautiful pictures, but sometimes she uses too much paint) and what I felt was an unjust resolution of the murderer and the rest of the world. In that regard I would have preferred a more satisfying ending, but other than that, I think it was well wrapped up.
0670021652|1.0|Well after loving EPL, I was excited to read another story by Liz.  I'm still halfway through this and don't think I will finish it.  It reminds me of reading my Economics book at PSU my freshman year, my eyes just can't stay open and I find myself skimming over the words.  I wanted so badly to love this story and be entranced by it but it's just not there.  I'm sure that Liz herself had an immense pressure to write a follow up, and maybe that is the problem.  It just doesn't flow.  There are small stories that she tells about her travels and finding out about other societies' image of marriage that are interesting.  Maybe someday when I have nothing else going on, I'll finish it.

B003LAH7MU|5.0|to say that this is a tired re do i ask, have you ever seen an actor play the same role in different productions? or an opera star join many an opera company performing the same role time and again? it can be quite moving. likewise, hearing sting's raw vocals supported by lush full blown orchestrations is exciting and turns old favorites on their ear.
0061353248|4.0|\\"Some have tried to pretend that economics is a [natural] science in the sense that physics is a science. Mathematical models were one route to this respectability, but scientific method has always been absent. The recent financial crisis brought with it a large demonstration of the failure of economics as a scientific pretender.    It also showed how little economists, who had not had the rigorous training of scientists and engineers, know of the subtle art of approximation. Reasons for the failure of many models included the failure to recognise the limits of important approximations, such as the mistaken notions that humans make decisions rationally; that frequency distributions are always 'normal'; and that rare events can be treated by statistical methods that work for more frequent events.    Behavoural economics has promise to be an improvement. Dan Ariely's book is one of many on the relatively new behavioural economics. Rooted in psychology and experiment (even if I am not sure that the experiments meet the rigorous standards of natural sciences), it starts from the proposition that human behavour is what humans actually do. This is complex and, in some senses not rational; but this is not to say that human behavour is not predictable to some extent.    When you have read the book, which I recommend, you may reach the conclusion that at least behavioural economics - and perhaps economics as a whole - should be re-classified as a branch of applied psychology.    And you should recommend it to every politician and financial regulator you know.\\"
B0034JKZ86|4.0|In the World, its been 70 years in the making. In my world, its been 34.<br /><br />I have heard all of the criticism: prince Naveen is too light skinned (what a light skinned man can love a Black woman?), that it shouldn't have been set in New Orleans (that person is an idiot) and should not have had voodoo (uh hello, have you ever been there?!)<br /><br />As a Black (well, biracial) woman whose adored father died before he could see her transition to greatness, this film delivers.<br /><br />Disney has the grace to go old school with gorgeous hand drawn sets that made me smile huge. When they get on the street car, I got excited. When they drove past mansions, I thought, \\"hey, I've been there!\\" and when they showed a loving family sharing dinner with their neighbors, it gave me a warm glow.<br /><br />One of the messages of the movie is clear: sometimes what we want and what we need are different. Oh and sadly, sometimes hard work is not enough. The former is a lesson I know well. The latter, I'm still working on.<br /><br />The vivid, vibrant colors, the voice of Anika Noni Rose and the characters Tiana encounters are fun and just what you would expect from a Disney feature. The Shadow Man, played with style by Keith David, is a tip of the hat to that Voodoo Trickster god Papa Legba (and if I was you, I'd stop talking smack.)<br /><br />Personally, I loved it. The vibrancy and spirit of this film fits not only one of my favorite places on Earth, but works with 1920's vivid cultural panarama. One of the characters I truly loved is Lotte: say what you will, but I promise you, I know many a Southern girl just like her. Funny, vivicious and spoiled rotten! I thought Lotte was pure fun.<br /><br />At the very end, Tiana sings the final line of the movie \\"Dreams come true in New Orleans\\" and my heart simply welled up and overflowed: because dreams do come true in New Orleans and that is why the movie was set there.<br /><br />Focusing on it being the site of a terrible tragedy and overlooking its rich and magnificent history is a travesty.<br /><br />Don't focus on how long it took to get a Black princess or any of the silly, trivial little things that people jumped on (really? the prince is too light skinned? *rolls eyes*)<br /><br />Instead, celebrate a return to real classic animation, to a beautiful new young princess and her prince finding true love.

9889979942|5.0|Unlike most photography books, this isn't just filled with a bunch of idyllic images of China. Rather than just falling back on postcard like landscapes and images, this book has captured the being of the Chinese. Both the beauty and the obscure, the innocence and stark reality of daily life in a crowded and mysterious country. It ia more than just  good coffee table material; the photographer captures images of the Chinese in natural land urban landscape, the craziness of city life-- all stuff you might not see, even if you were there. The photos themselves are exploding with their own stories, and the author does an incredible job of combining words, pictures, and humanity into a pleasurably ode to the Chinese.
0307454541|1.0|The only mystery regarding this book is the buzz. The heroine is a cardboard cutout of a pierced-tattooed-goth-biker-hacker (the most talented in Sweden, says the book), who, as we're often reminded, isn't anorexic; she just looks like she is (yay! best of both worlds!). We're told that maybe she could be a model, if only she wasn't so darn rebellious! Sparks fly (unconvincingly) when she encounters the hero, perhaps due to some hidden book character chemistry that we're not privy to. She stutters, she stammers. She doesn't know what's come over her!  Could he be a worthy opponent to her superior intellect?<br /><br />More sinister is the graphic violence of the rape scenes--it seems quite obvious that the writer got off writing them. Other amusing passages involve detailed, fetishized descriptions of Apple computers. The self-righteous \\"progressiveness\\" of the tone gets tiresome, as the book attempt to conceal its own misogyny.<br /><br />I am not one to not finish a book. So I bit the bullet and rolled my eyes for about five days. I'm happy to put it behind me.
B003ICWTR4|3.0|Almost anyone who's seen Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band between 2007 and 2009 would agree that it was their strongest period on the road since the River Tour. Defying the restrictions of time and age, and even after the death of a key band member (Danny Federici in April of 2008), Bruce and the E Street Band electrified the stage each and every time they went out there, putting on some of their most legendary shows in years, culminating in the fall of 2009, when Bruce and the band performed their first six albums (\\"Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J.\\" up to \\"Born in the U.S.A.\\") in their entirety. With so many wonderful performances to choose from, one would think a truly special dvd release could be made to commemorate such a landmark period in the band's history?<br /><br />Unfortunately, it was not be. Like previous Bruce live releases, Bruce and co. have once again taken the easy way out, going for a show that had already been properly shot, mixed, edited and aired on television prior to its release, rather than take a little extra time to sit down and sift through the endless hours of pro-shot footage out there to create something fans would truly appreciate.<br /><br />\\"London Calling\\" Live in Hyde Park\\" was a show Bruce had done as part of a festival rather than an official Bruce show. Granted, the majority of the audiences were there for him, but you can certainly feel a difference in this show then \\"Live in New York City\\" or \\"Live in Barcelona\\" or even \\"Live in Dublin.\\" The show has an incredibly bland, standard set list, as opposed to the many long lost gems Bruce had revived over the course of two years.<br /><br />Performance wise, Bruce and the band are at only 80 % total. Having done Glastonbury less than 24 hours earlier, Bruce's voice is tired and hoarse, with no force or power, robbing him of the expressive emotional coloring he's able to give his material when he's at his best. Even at 59, Bruce is still usually able to muster up the same energy he had at 29 or 35, but here he gets powered out quite often. The show's horrid stage setup, including a troublesome staircase that saps a lot of the connection Bruce is able to make so easily with his audience.<br /><br />The band's playing is strong, aside from Clarence Clemons, whose health woes have sapped a great deal of his playing skills. Steven Van Zandt in particular is the most lively he's appeared on stage in years. But even the band, great though they still may be, aren't quite up to their game here. The opening \\"London Calling\\" cover is a mess thanks to Steve's slurring of the lyrics, and \\"Racing in the Street,\\" \\"The Rising,\\" and \\"Jungleland\\" lack the power of previous versions. \\"Jungleland\\" is particularly disappointing here, with Bruce's voice in tatters and the tempo brought down to a snail's pace (Clarence nails the solo, though). \\"Lonesome Day\\" also suffers from similar faults.<br /><br />There are some highlight to be sure - \\"Badlands\\" and \\"Born to Run\\" never seem to get old, \\"Out in the Street\\" and \\"Rosalita\\" are a blast, \\"Glory Days\\" is given its definitive rendition, and \\"No Surrender\\" with Brian Fallon is sublime. The three song stretch of \\"Seeds,\\" \\"Johnny 99,\\" and \\"Youngstown\\" is also excellent, and represent the band at their most intense.<br /><br />But these highlights don't seem to outweigh the many tired, overplayed fluff that is \\"Bobby Jean,\\" \\"Waiting on a Sunny Day,\\" and \\"The Promised Land.\\" And \\"Outlaw Pete\\" and \\"Working on a Dream\\" just don't hold up to the new stuff.<br /><br />As I said, there were so many other options they could've gone for - Danny's last shows in Boston and Indiana. The magnificent trio of shows at Giant Stadium in 2008. The St. Louis '08 show that many fans ranked up there with Roxy '78 and the Vietnam Veterans show in 1981. And, of course, the album shows - intense, once in a lifetime performances that brought some of Bruce's most underrated gems to life. All of these are now gathering dust.<br /><br />Thesound and picture quality are the best of any Bruce release to date, which stings all the more since such aethestic goodies ae wasted on an inferior product.date, which stings all the more since such aethestic goodies ae wasted on an inferior product.

B0006ZE7G2|5.0|Who was that idiot that called this movie crap??? Oh my GOD! How could ANYBODY say this classic is crap???? As far as I'm concerned you could glue googly eyes on crayons as long as you played Pink Floyd music with it I'd STILL buy it!! What kind of a freak doesn't like Pink Floyd?? He even made some nasty crack about Cheech and Chong!! Obviously from the sound of his review he probably has all the personality of a pea. Jeese, who turned over the rock?!!    My uncle loved this movie, and he's 80 years old!! What can I say, the old man has taste!! Respect your elders, buy this DVD!!!    In any kind of packaging, this film is pure perfection. The \\"comfortably numb\\" segment is nothing short of amazing!! David G. is a GOD on the guitar!! As far as I'm concerned, the animation is as better than a lot of the soulless crap animation that is produced now!  This movie is a timeless masterpiece that never gets old. I've seen the concert and probably watched this movie a thousand times!   I highly recommend this movie for those of you out there who are looking to add pure perfection to your DVD collection!    You wanna impress people that are looking through your movie collection, then make sure this movie is in there!! And hey, you get a poster with it! How great is that??
B003UOQMGO|5.0|I am a classical musician and have loved Sting's music since the days of Synchronicity. No matter how many remakes there are I will never tire of his music.  The orchestral arrangement combined with Sting's unique voice and style makes this album top on my list.
B003EV6DBM|5.0|I became hooked on the Doctor back in the 70's (like most of us in the USA), thanks to PBS (remember those fund raising PBS/WHO marathons?). The new series is terrific! Matt Smith is hilarious and has made the role his own. Sure, it's fluff (DW always has been), but it's incredibly entertaining and well done (can't beat those BBC-trained actors). Recommendation: if you have younger kids or grandchildren, and DW is a little too intense for them at times, try \\"The Sarah Jane Adventures.\\" The series is extremely well done- and we enjoy it as much as our grandchildren do. In fact, I believe David Tennant will be making an appearance as the Doctor in one of the current season's episodes. The show is in it's third season.
B00362DRNG|2.0|I am at a loss for words about what quality control at EMI was thinking when they approved these \\"remasters\\". This album isn't as bad as Seven and the Ragged Tiger, which is just disgraceful, but it's not good. Not sure why there are so many good reviews on here, if you look on Amazon UK, people are not happy with the sound. It is flat and way over compressed, plain and simple. It's not even compressed WELL. Very amateurish and inexcusable for a highly anticpated (and pricey) classic album release. My original CD release sounds much better, and that is what I will listen to.    On the plus side, the content is fantastic. Remixes, B-Sides and demos are all here. Plus ALL of the videos (finally!) are on here and in excellent quality.    I bought the first 3 \\"remastered\\" DD albums blindly, but will wait for reviews before I purchase any more in the series.
B000RZGFYS|5.0|Listen,  I know master of puppets is aswome (though I hate metallica these days) Anthrax's 'among the living' is great. some others are close,  but reign in blood is the best of them all.  A non stop killing machine is early slayer.  Love these guys!
B00362DRQS|2.0|The sound on this release is just awful. It is WAY, WAY overcompressed, to the point of distortion in some places. A completely amateur job. A high school kid could do better on his PC. Seriously. The orginal dynamic range is completely squashed away. It sounds like an old cassette recording from FM radio that was recorded at too high a volume.    I actually imported \\"The Reflex\\" into an audio program and the sound wave peaks are literally clipped, not just compressed, but actually CUT OFF. No professional sound engineer should ever have approved that for a master. It's inexcusable. I am at a loss for words about how this \\"remaster\\" could have gotten approval by quality control at EMI.    My original CD release sounds MUCH better, and that is what I will listen to.    I a bit bewildered by all the good reviews here. Did these people actually listen to the CD first? Or are they just swept away by nostalgia? If you read the reviews on Amazon UK, people are very unhappy, as they should be.    On the plus side, the content is good, even if it sounds terrible. Remixes and B-Sides are all here (no demos unfortunately). But they are all over compressed as well. The DVD has \\"As the Lights Go Down\\", which I enjoyed seeing again in good quality, and all of the videos are on here (though it seems strange they did not include \\"Wild Boys\\"). So it might be worth it for \\"As the Lights Go Down\\", the videos and the TV performances, but the audio CDs are a complete disaster. I am so disappointed.    I bought the first 3 \\"remastered\\" DD albums blindly, Rio was good, Duran Duran was bad and this is abysmal. I will wait for reviews before I purchase any more in the series.
B00006RAKP|5.0|For some reason, it appears that stopped purchasing music during the 1980's and 1990's.  I am so glad that I can purchase CD's that let me enjoy old songs that I missed.  I'm having a real good time listening to these songs.

9889979942|5.0|There are lots of books on China out there, including myriad photography books. Carter's book stands out because instead of focusing on landscape, architecture, or food, he shows the beauty and diversity of Chinese people. Those who have not traveled or lived in China, may not realize the amount of variety among the people--with this book you be able to fully understand and appreciate how unique each ethnicity is.  Chinese people are not just simply Chinese.     In each province one can find many different ethnicities, each varied in appearance and fashion, traditions and attitude. Carter captures these differences beautifully in his book \\"China: Portrait of a People.\\" He also managed to travel to every corner of China, illustrating everyone from Han to Tibetans to Uyghurs. If you have been to China or have any interest in the country, you will enjoy this book that gives such a wonderful insight into its people.
030726999X|5.0|I have devoured the other 2 books .....am only sad that there are no more from this very skilled writer!
030726999X|3.0|I started reading the 3rd book the day after I finished the second one. I was hoping that there would be a completely new mystery in this book, but it's a continuation of the second. Within a few pages all the progress Salander and Blomkvist made in the second book is lost and it's almost like she is back on step one. After that though, nothing, and I mean nothing (with the exception of one broken finger) goes wrong for the good guys. You expect in a thriller/mystery that the bad guys occasionally get the upper hand and the good guys need to escape or regroup or something... Not in this book. Everything works perfect for the good guys. There is also a side story with Berger that is just filler and contributes nothing to the main story.<br /><br />Overall it's an OK book but it's not as good as the first two.
B001BN1ZHW|2.0|Sweeney Todd is probably my favorite Tim Burton movie - that being said, everyone has their own opinions, and my review is mostly going to focus on the quality of the blu-ray transfer.    I have to say, I'm pretty dissapointed with this one. To me, the whole purpose of a movie being transferred to blu-ray is to make the picture and sound as good as it can possibly be, with the current technology. Sadly, there are more than a few studios who don't seem to think so.    The picture on this release should be an embarrassment to Dreamworks. While it is very detailed and sharp in some scenes, for the majority of the film, there is so much grain and digital artifacts it is ridiculous. It is mind-boggling how picture quality can vary so drastically from scene to scene on a digital disc! With most blu rays the picture tends to suffer in brighter scenes. This one is the complete opposite - any moderately dark scene (which is 90 percent of this movie) looks so grainy, and speckled you'll swear you are watching a videotape. Honestly, do some studios have an automatic mastering program that does this without a human technician to make corrections? I have to wonder how some of these transfers go out the door looking like this. I compared several scenes on blu-ray first, and then on the dvd using the same playstation 3,  with the most recent firmware, on a full 1080p HDTV with v1.4HDMI cables. In all instances, the DVD actually looked better.     The one thing I can say about this release is that the sound is excellent! One of the better audio tracks I have heard - the DVD doesn't even come close to the blu-ray in that aspect.    This was a HUGE dissapointment to me, as this is one of my favorite films of recent years - I expected better for my money. Dreamworks Blu-Ray division owes Tim Burton an apology. If you are a fan, and can find this for $10 or less, buy it just for the audio and extras. If you want to upgrade the picture from the DVD, don't bother....
B001TH8UUA|4.0|Very nice cable.  Used to use s-video and analog audio but this is much simpler and quality is great.  Very convenient.

B000MRAAJM|5.0|I absolutely loved this series. Seeing wildlife and fantastic locales around the world in HD is quite the eye opener. From forests to jungles to oceans strange new areas of the world hold fascinating creatures of all types and varieties, and this series shows you the interactions between them from multiple sides, showing both the hunter and hunted point of view. This series also shows you locations at different times of the year, and explains how different seasons force wildlife to adapt. Overall, this series really holds your attention and makes you see the diverse planet we live on in a new light. This isn't your high school nature documentary, you'll be wide awake for this. Having it on disc is nice because you don't have to see any commercials, which interrupt flow.
0061876747|3.0|This novel begins with a nod to the John Buchan classic, \\"The Thirty Nine Steps\\" but it never really achieves the effortless thrills of its precursor. The protagonist, Adam, is in London from the United States for a job interview at Imperial College as a climatology professor. He goes to eat at a restaurant after the interview and gets talking casually to a man at the next table. The man departs leaving a folder behind. Adam calls him to return the folder and finds him in his apartment with a bread knife through his chest.<br /><br />Adam goes on the lam and is quickly reduced to a penniless homeless man living in the dregs of London. We are also introduced to some other characters including a sinister retired commando turned hit-man who is after Adam and Rita, a river policewoman who supplies the love interest.<br /><br />Adam's various adventures in the shadows are interesting but the tension never really ratchets up. The climax of the story is an awful anti-climax. It seems all too easy for the hero to survive and prosper. He will eventually confound his enemies and bring their dastardly conspiracy to an end in similarly effortless fashion.<br /><br />A book of this type requires a good climax. But the required direct confrontation between good and evil fails to materialize. The author, for some unknown reason, flinches and fails to deliver the denouement the book has been building toward and the plot demands.

I laughed my but off, especially at bad Bernie who wrote a Christmas essay and wished that for one day you could see people's farts! It is a great movie, very cute. I watch it often and may even memorize it at some point. If I'd have been in the states when it came out, I would have paid full price for it. But I didn't learn of it until recently. Now I'm making up for lost opportunity and watching this movie often and much. Its great!

9889979942|5.0|As beautiful and telling as the photos are, I still keep thinking to myself, \\"Tom Carter walked China.\\" I think this is a stunning act of imagination, courage and the ultimate statement of wanting to connect with a place through its people. China is an enigma to most Americans and this book answers that huge question. You see the diversity, scale, contradictions, power and most of all the humanity of China. These are incredible concepts to capture in a book. The act of walking China is one of those legendary feats that reminds you of the power of doing what everyone else says can't be done. Impossible today, possible tomorrow. Thank you Tom for reminding all of us what is possible and that to dream is good- to act is better.

An elegant summary of the most important aspect of money and monetary instruments.    After reading this book you will find yourself greatly enriched in the areas of contemporary economic understanding.      The book is blissfully free of formulas or self righteous agenda.    You will find yourself listening to the new on TV or reading the financial papers and increasingly shaking your head - it is amazing what a little understanding will do to make most news and opinions redundant.    A \\"must have\\" for those who want to survive the coming financial crisis part 2.

Yes, the original version may not have had all of the computer or updated graphics like this one, but it was more interesting and more having to do with Mythology and not so much of the christianity basis. The original one was longer and more exciting and interesting. I give this one a 3 majorly because of the graphics and the slight excitement.
B003HLM2QO|5.0|My fiance loved this cd. It is a really great cd to listen to. Very addicting on some songs. Wasn't disappointed when I received it.
B003HLM2QO|5.0|Ozzy is alive, well and still rockin'.  Heavy riffs.  Lovin' all the songs, but theres something extra special about \\"Soul Sucker\\".  \\"Scream\\" is going to be the perfect concert song.  Now OZZY just needs to head to Louisiana so I can witness this living legend sing this and all the great songs he has made that will never die.  Great purchase especially at these Amazon prices.
B002ZG977Y|5.0|This movie was great.  It had alot of action   It had great special effects.   I would recommend this movie.
B000O77SRC|5.0|You can tell it's loosely based on the communist radical raf groups of West Germany and europe and other LIKE-Minded silly radicals, And I enjoy that he is fighting these commies in this movie, plus you got officer winslow from Family Matters. Great Action.
B000002U9E|4.0|At first I wasn't too keen on the CD but the more I listened to it the more it grew on me and now I love it. Running Up That Hill (A Deal With God) was recently played at a very close friend's funeral so the song means so much too me! It is wonderful!
B001N1DPDE|5.0|This is a real beast of a knife.  Did a lot of research before settling on this model, and boy am I happy.  I needed a knife that would be good for camping/survival (not for skinning or whittling) and that is exactly what I got out of the box.  Blade was sharp enough to shave my arm and the weight/balance of the knife felt very comfortable in my hand (which, for reference, is between a Medium and a Large size when using hospital gloves).  The thing batons wood like butter and chops like an axe.  Very happy with this product, especially considering the price.  If you buy it, just make sure to keep a very light coat of oil on the blade to prevent rusting -- easy to do and very worth it!
B003ITZBVS|5.0|Before watching the movie, I was sure my first complaint would be the absence of Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill. Irrelevant now. This was a great movie. Sets the bar high on DC features to come. Was well acted, had a great story, dark and brutal. Would have loved Kevin and Mark in their respective roles, but this film stood on it's own. Was very surprised at the production quality and hope to see more films like this from the Batman DCU team. So I'll put my only complaint at the end instead- Kevin Conroy is Batman. Mark Hamill is the Joker.
B0036EH3XE|3.0|Lost is a show that had everything in abundance - drama, suspense, mystery, love, humor, poignancy, terrific acting, beautiful scenery -- well you get the idea. I loved this show. From the heartpounding Pilot episode on, I was hooked. When other people stopped watching and said it was too confusing, I stuck with it. When the writers announced a few years back that they were going to set a time limit to this series, I was thrilled. Things were getting a little too crazy and Lindelof and Cuse had introduced a few too many mysteries. This was a golden opportunity to wrap the story up, answer dozens of questions, etc., and there was plenty of time to do it.<br /><br />Season Six started off with a bang for me with LAX. I loved it and it felt like things were indeed going to come full circle with the characters. There were lots of episodes to come. And then of course, came 'What Kate Does' and even though I really disliked it, I'm the forgiving sort and I figured things would get better. I did find myself disturbed by the introduction of yet even more new characters (Dogen and Lennon) when we still lacked resolution for most of the familiar ones. C'mon, guys, there isn't THAT much time to get to all the Island Mysteries!<br /><br />And I couldn't help some misgivings over what seemed the needless, rather baffling torture of Sayid. But I'm easy to please and I forgot about all that for the next several episodes. Dr. Linus featured some brilliant acting by Michael Emerson. Of course, eventually we got to 'Recon' and as much as I adore Josh Holloway it was a pretty sub-par episode that really added *nothing* to the plot. Nothing. Besides, I never liked Charlotte anyway.<br /><br />But things picked up again with the next episode (and the *true* highlight of the season) with Nestor Carbonell's incredible, career-defining episode, 'Ab Aeterno'. Holy cow, what a performance! It was like a big screen moment on the small screen and one I enjoy watching each time. That brilliancewas followed by several more good to very good episodes.<br /><br />Then, of course, as all true Lost fans know, came 'Across the Sea' which quickly demonstrated that turkeys aren't just confined to Thanksgiving. I actually felt embarrassed for Titus  Welliver and Mark Pellegrino. The woman who played the mother was dreadful as was the whole episode. Thankfully, that was followed by 'What They Died For' which (hopeful Lost fan that I was) had me convinced that 'The End' would really provide some soul-satisfying answers.<br /><br />Now, you have to understand that I actually liked almost all of Season 6. There were some great performances - Nestor Carbonell in Ab Aeterno, Matthew Fox delivering some of his best acting of the whole series (\\"want to try another stick?\\" was great), the always brilliant Michael Emerson, Josh Holloway in the dock scene when he was talking with Kate (they didn't give Josh enough to do Season 6 [very disappointing], Terry O'Quinn for his dual role as Locke/MIB.<br /><br />That being said, I can't overlook all the flaws. It doesn't mean I don't appreciate the show or that I won't ever re-watch my DVDs (I'm buying Season Six if that tells you anything) BUT for me, The End (of Lost) was horribly unsatisfying.<br /><br />Some people say to those of us who didn't like it: you just didn't get it. The fact is, I did. I still found it disappointing and frustrating. There weren't just a few unanswered questions. There were dozens. Some of the answers were rushed (the Whispers for instance), some didn't make any sense, and some just weren't answered satisfactorily (if Walt was so \\"special\\" why did he become so \\"dispensable\\", why was Widmore so determined to get back to the Island? why, instead of exploring Claire's three years on the island were we introduced to characters like Zoe, Lennon, Dogen, whom we didn't care about?, how did Sayid end up with Shannon instead of Nadia? what was the origin of the statue? how did Jacob make all that money to finance his off-island travels/ventures? why did \\"mother\\" kill \\"real mother\\"? what was so special about Aaron? one that I forgot the other day -- what on earth was the point of Ilana, the backstory of her being in the hospital at the beginning of Ab Aeterno? etc., etc., etc.)? And most pressing of all -- why do Lost admirer's hate having these questions asked? It's not disloyal. It's just realistic.<br /><br />I did like the Sawyer/Juliet reunion scene at the end. I think it was the only one that really hit home for me. As for the rest, the scene with Vincent was great...<br /><br />Overall - great series with a disappointing ending. I'll watch it again, but the thrill is gone.
1878424319|2.0|It could just be the sophomoric writing style, but I didn't find anything remarkable in this book.  There's nothing that I particularly DISagree with, but there's certainly nothing unique and profound.  This was a waste of my time and money.
9889979942|5.0|I keep this book on my coffee table and it never ceases to amaze everyone that picks it up and thumbs through it.  The photos within capture a breathtaking diversity that was unimaginable for me until I received this book. I have yet to travel to China, but feel so connected through the author's work.  Laid out by region, I enjoy how easy it is to dive in and out of sections. I look forward to more from this author and would highly recommend this book to anyone.
B001EYGOEM|5.0|I gotta say, unless she seriously screws up in the future I'll probably buy more of her albums. I was exposed to Taylor's self-titled debut thanks to my mother, who bought it after hearing the admittedly rather overplayed Tim McGraw on a local country station. I wasn't a fan initially (in fact the aforementioned song tended to get on my nerves when I'd hear it on the radio), but then my mom played the CD on a long car trip and my displeasure softened first into indifference and ultimately became liking. So I was excited when, in 2008, I learned that Taylor's second album would be due out in November. I received it as a Christmas present that same year. Standout tracks for me are the title track, which has a little bit of a rock vibe to it (there are quite a few songs with that same feel actually), Fifteen, Tell me Why, You Belong with Me and Forever and Always. Others I like are The Best Day, which is a tribue to Taylor's family and in particular her mom, Breathe (admittedly a rather downing track that for some bizarre reason once served as the background music in a dream I had in which I had to give up my cat), and You're Not Sorry, which any CSI fan will remember was remixed and featured in the same episode in which Taylor herself was a guest star. And while the subject matter of the song and the episode in question are different, hearing it in the context of the episode put a rather disturbing spin on it that gave me chills.    All in all I think Fearless is an excellent album. As with her debut I like more or less every song on this album, which is quite rare for me. I'm not a big country fan but I'm definitely a Taylor fan.
0143038419|2.0|This book was a nice idea, a woman coming out of a divorce travels to find herself and learn to be alone. A pretty typical plot and idea, nothing original. In the first third of the book she goes to italy, makes friends, learns the language, eats good food and has some fun. This part of the book is light and fun to read and you are happy for her finding happiness. Next she goes to india where she prays and lives modestly, meets some people and talks about the way of chanting and her reactions to meditation. Some of this part is interesting but she prattles on many times about unimportant contrasts or side stories that make you flip a few pages ahead to shut her up. The third part 'Love' was a magician trying to pull a rabbit out of their hat but you already know its there waiting for him to grab it. You know she'll find some guy and end up happy, if only because she wants the book to sell. I find the fact that she does this also kind of annoying. I thought the book was supposed to be about a woman who wants to find happiness in being alone and independent? And yet she ends her book triumphantly with being tethered to another man, moving for him and uprooting her whole existance to be with him. Nice independence huh? It just feels hypocritical, I wish she could have learned to be happy alone, rather than having to find another guy to end the book on a positive note. Other than the man she falls for, the 'Love' part is mostly boring, she has a few fun experiences with a medicine man and meets some friends but it is nothing special. And it teaches us nothing about love, as she doesn't examine it to talk about the history or do any of the 'fact' type comparisons that she does in the other parts of her book.<br /><br />Overall the book starts out strong and dwindles into nothing towards the end. I wish the writer had tried a little harder to make the idea of this book into a reality and each part of the book link into a cohesive whole. This book could have been much better.
B000H8SFMK|5.0|I've been a Pogues fan for a little over ten years, since my brother exposed me to their music as well as that of a few other Irish outfits. My favorite albums are Rum, Sodomy and the Lash and Red Roses for Me, but I'll definitely have to add If I should Fall from Grace with God to the list. It features some of the catchiest tunes the band has ever written or performed, not the least being the title track, Turkish Song of the Damned and Bottle of Smoke. Other standouts include Fairytale of New York, which features vocals by the late Kirsty MacColl, and The Irish Rover and one of my all time favorite Irish tunes, Rare Old Mountain Dew. Both Irish Rover and Rare Old Mountain Dew feature guest vocals by the late Dubliner Ronnie Drew. And while I must admit that I never could quite get into Drew's voice (which has been described on occasion as sounding like coal being crushed under a door), he was nevertheless a talented musician and despite his gruff voice he was in no way a bad singer. I just could never quite get into the sound of his voice. But both Irish Rover and Mountain Dew are excellently done on this album (the latter has always been my favorite being particularly catchy and upbeat). So if you consider yourself a Pogues fan (or at least a Shane MacGowan fan), or even if you aren't necessarily but want an enjoyable listening experience you might just do yourself a favor by giving this album a listen.
B000JJS8TM|5.0|I'm not the greatest Beatles fan, yet this set and \\"Yellow Submarine Songtrack - 1999 remastered version\\" I enjoy them very much. Love sounds amazing in the cd player, not to mention the audio dvd in the home theater. If you have ever listened to this Beatles songs, chances are you will like what Martin has accomplished in this edition too.
0061245097|5.0|This book opened with a big surprise for me.  It has been four years since the events in the last book!  Cat is fulfilling her promise and training her Scooby squad to kill vampires.  Cat gets along alright with her teammates, but she's just marking time living in limbo.  Her life hasn't been complete since she left Bones.      The beginning was pretty slow for me.  I had no real interest in the life she had carved out for herself.  I was actually really surprised that she became friends with them.  You were forced into this position but you're okay with that now and are fine with being best buddies?  What?  I can understand making the best of a bad situation, but come on!    So, the beginning slowly covers new details of Cat's life.  One of her teammates, Tate, wants her bad and admits it when he's sloppy drunk.  Her friend is getting married and Cat's in the wedding party.  Cat finally decides it's time to start dating again.  They weren't badly written scenes, but they weren't what I was waiting for, so they seemed tedious.  But finally Bones came back in the picture and everything seemed right in the world again.    Bones was great in this book.  I liked him in the first book, [book:Halfway to the Grave 1421990], but I didn't love him.  He was entertaining, but something was lacking.  With this book he really won me over.  He was so upfront and determined to risk anything to stay with Cat.  I loved that he was brutally honest about his sex life while after she left him.  I love a man who favors honestly over sparing someone's feelings.      I like Bones with Cat, but I also worry he's getting the short end of the stick.  He has been the one who has had to constantly bend to stay with Cat.  It's always him taking that extra step to make sure they're still doing well together.  I wish she showed half as much commitment to him.  He was willing to end a friendship that seemed to mean a lot to him just because that person tried to plant doubts in Cat's mind about herrelationship with Bones.  He won't let anything get between them, at least on his end.    Once again Cat is a less than sympathetic character to me.  She spends more time irritating me than making me root for her.  I wish she would just get over herself.  She creates drama about everything.  I totally get that she's intimidated by the legions Bones has slept with in the past.  It's understandable, but the man is how old?  He hasn't been a monk the whole time.  I loved that Bones wouldn't let her just ignore it and have it fester.  He wanted to talk it out and make sure she knew there was no other woman for him now.  Which led to an extremely sexy scene.  Bones really is carrying their relationship.    We get to meet a lot of other intriguing vampires this time around.  I still have a soft spot for Spade, but I am interested in Mencheres now too.      The action in this one seems to have stepped up from the last book.  It was exciting and fun, even if Cat did continue to make stupid decisions at times.  The big reveal about Justina's history made me have an \\"ah hah!\\" moment.  I definitely wouldn't put it past her.  I'm so excited about the next book that it could only be topped by the news of Tate's much deserved death.  Die Tate, die!
0399156577|4.0|Fiona Bristow, Dog Whisperer Extraordinaire, has settled in Orcas Island, having escaped a crazed (aren't they always) serial killer, who killed her fiancée and his canine companion. She now is devoting her life to training and running a \\"search and rescue\\" unit, while offering general behavioral dog training. So when the very sexy, artist Simon comes to ask her assistance with training his ill-behaved dog, Jaws, she is surprised that there is an immediate attraction. Initially the pair seem unlikely. While Simon is extremely talented, he is often grouchy, messy and blunt. Fiona, on the other hand is extremely organized and outgoing. Falling fast into a world-wind affair, that neither thought would ever work, they find themselves suddenly confronted with her past and danger at every turn when red scarves start appearing. Having never thought that he would settle down, Simon is surprised to find that he doesn't necessarily mind carving out parts of his life to include Fiona and only wants her safe. Meanwhile, the imprisoned Red Scarf Killer has a puppet (ok an accomplice) who has picked up where he left off and who wants to improve on his formula for success. Referred to as \\"RSKII\\" by law enforcement and the media, the new killer he intends to give his teacher the one prize that escaped, Fiona.     Personally, I enjoyed \\"The Search\\". It was a quick and easy read with likeable characters. And while Nora Roberts followed her traditional formula for a great romance/suspense novel [there was a bad guy (make that two), agents bent on bringing evil to justice, a sweet step-mother, great friends and several cute dogs], I think she still gave the reader that something special to make the story enjoyable and slightly different.
B000009EAD|5.0|I really don't own alot of IE albums I have 5 or 6 of their albums all packed up in boxes in my closet, but I can tell you this album here is the real deal out of all the albums I own from IE. It's their most finest epic thrash album from these guys and it is faster and more melodic and even their album cover looks wickedly awesome, Im really not too crazy about their newer stuff it just wasn't as good as their older albums like this one and i mean this is a real classic.<br /><br />New to IE? Then you cannot avoid this album here!<br /><br />\m/ stay metal \m/
0525423842|1.0|I realize that this book was dedicated to John Grisham's son.  I picture him as the kid who has grown up with everything from his wealthy and successful father as they move between their homes across the South.  This book was meant for boys, but I cannot recommend this book to any boy (or girl) that I know and teach (6th, 7th, 8th grade).    The first chapters introduced me to many of the judges of the courthouse.  They were all male; I kept reading hoping that there was one wise women who worked here.  No.  Out of four or five judges presented as characters, even the menial animal court judge, had to be a male.  The secretaries and clerks in the office and courthouse were all female.  The mother is a family/divorce attorney, but I just love that her son characterizes her as one who \\"enjoyed spending money on clothes and looking nice (p. 34).\\"  To be fair, she does have other redeeming qualities, like she hates to cook dinner so they go out to eat.  Dad's advice one time is to zap the spaghetti in the microwave.  Hey--Woods Boone--why don't you try to make dinner for your family then?  Even the paralegal in the office was a young man.  Then the portrayal of Boone's good \\"friend\\" (girl) who was a daughter of hippy, druggy, in trouble parents going through a divorce and child custody issues. Of course, every child of divorce is bound to end up pregnant, troubled, incarcerated, and suffering from mental issues eventually because her parents are so messed up too. Contrast that with the young girl Boone gives animal court advice to, who really is the object of his desire--the most popular, good-looking girl whose married parents are busy, affluent professionals and she is the head cheerleader--and of course, she gets her little doggy back, too after disobeying leash laws.  I have taken my finger out of my throat by this point, and try to continue to read.  It just does not get any better.      This book perpetuates every sterotype that I have known. I was hoping for something progressive that would inspire both genders of the students that I teach.
B003JLA4KS|5.0|This is a phenomenal feature on the band. It catapulted them from a band I really really like and admire to one I feel so connected with it's hard to not have them on my favs list. You really get inside the band and feel like you know them and where they came from. I'm so happy I didn't see this at a theater, instead waiting for the DVD, because the bonus features are so worth it. Especially the dinner the boys have towards the end of the film. They're so relaxed and hilarious and the get on so well. You feel like you're at the table with them!!!<br /><br />Rush out and get this DVD, or stay at home and buy here on amazon.com It's well worth it trust me!!!
B0038M2AZA|5.0|Saw this on DISH.  I think Claire Danes does an EXCELLENT job in this movie!!! If you like \\"true stories\\" this is a good one!!
B000063WDH|5.0|I was introduced to the Black Key's through they're most recent album, Brothers. Loving what I heard, I snapped up Rubber Factory and The Big Come Up. I have to say, this might be my favorite of the three. Each album has it's fine points, but this one in particular has a rough, almost bootlegged quality of sound to it. Each track is filled with an infectious raw energy that's hard to resist. And \\"Breaks\\" is probably my favorite Key's song to date--a catchy-ass screeching guitar lick loops over an almost hip-hop sounding drum beat. Then Auerbach's voice slides in, smooth as ice, and I can't pull the grin off my face.
B0009FTXGI|5.0|This lens hood fits perfectly and works good.  It's rather large but that's what it takes.  I just reverse it and leave it on the lens when I put the lens in my case.
6305127646|5.0|What an amazing film. My favorite with Val Kilmer. Val Kilmer takes on so many personas as the film dicatates for in this role and does an amazing job in each one.  This film gave me an \\"aha\\" moment with what a skill acting is and how in everyday life we all play multiple roles and when good at it with a purpose can create a desired outcome.  The movie is light and fun.  Just the right amount of action, romance, and humor.  A great find for both men and women who usually struggle with the battle over \\"Terminator\\" vs. \\"Pride and Predjudice\\".  Both my husband and I thoroughly enjoyed it.
9889979942|5.0|I have a collection of many books with photos of China, and I have determined that many of the books are almost redundant with similar photos of landscapes, architecture, and beautiful people.  While the photography in those books is often stunning, it still is a bit sterile or \\"touristy\\".  However, \\"China, Portrait of a People\\" is quite the opposite--no stock photos here; instead the photos truly capture the spirit of the everyday people throughout this vast, fascinating country.  I have been to China three times, and these pictures reflect the heart and soul of its amazing people. I always enjoyed seeing glimpses of life \\"behind the scenes\\" of the group tours--a walk into the traditional neighborhoods, shopping at the local shops, visiting towns that normally did not host tourists.  This book will take you even further from the tourist stage, as Tom traveled where few, if any, foreign visitors had stepped foot. The pictures are poignant, heartwarming, funny, and sad--depicting REAL LIFE, REAL PEOPLE, and REAL EMOTIONS.  When guests in our home look at my China books, they usually flip through the other \\"coffee table\\" books quickly, but they become totally engrossed in Portrait of a People.  I love going through it time after time, as I always see something (or someone) in a different light each time.      This book is a prize, a rare gem, reflecting an incredible undertaking. Thank you to Tom for sharing his amazing photos with us!
1579128149|5.0|I loved the pictures, but I also loved the technical info on the right margin, especially the electron orbital filling sequence. It helped explain the vertical and horizontal structure of the table of elements. I read Eric Scerri's book on The Periodic Table, but didn't understand the rare earths until reading Gray's book. I wasn't put off by the author's humor and occasional sarcasm. A picture at the back of the book of the author sitting at his Periodic Table Table suggested to me that he's quite a character. It was an easy read. I liked the format with each element described in pictures and text with each 2 page open spread (with an occasional extra spread for elements such as aluminum, titanium, iron, copper, tungsten, gold, lead, and uranium). I had a hard time putting the book down, especially because of the page-turning teaser about the \\"next\\" element. I love the fold-out pictorial periodic table at the back of the book. Truly worthy as a gift. I'm actually buying a second copy for my retired chemist big brother.
0061537969|5.0|I'm not one to talk religion or  politics or write book reviews because everyone has their own opinions and I probably cannot change them.  This book, however, begs me to tell you to read it.  I'll admit I am a dog lover and race car dummy.  This book could have been told through anyone's eyes and told through any metaphor. Enzo is perfection in the telling of this story and his use of racing metaphors works for even the non-lover of racing.  He tells it so you get it.      Enzo is loving, intelligent and wise.  He listens unlike, as he says, humans.  That's what makes him so wise.  It also makes him intelligent because he learns from what he hears.  His purpose in life is to please his owner and to come back as a good human - there's the loving.  Most of those in his life don't realize how lucky they are to have him; those who do depend on him.  Enzo will take you through his life with laughter, tears and thought.  He sees things we know are there but refuse to acknowledge.    This is definitely a must-read book, not once but many times.  And pass it on.  Faster.
B000QCS8TW|4.0|I love the book, I am kind of disappointed to find that the kindle version is full of typos and strange symbols inserted in the text
0743455967|4.0|ON WRITING is not quite a memoir and not quite a writing manual, but as a window into the world of Stephen King, it's certainly a good read. The book is split into three parts: first some vignettes from his life (from working class child to mass market superstar), second some lessons on the craft, and third an account of his car accident and his personal relationship to writing. The prose is clean, cogent, and punchy, sprinkled with gritty imagery and splashes of sardonic humor, and if the book seems to meander a little, for the most part it gripped me.    The writing advice is helpful but pedestrian. You'll find the same tips in countless other instruction manuals or from writing teachers all across America. Avoid adverbs, murder your darlings, respect grammar, beware the passive voice, revise, and so forth. The most unique and illuminating suggestion that King offers is also the most dubious: he suggests aspiring writers eschew plotting (like him) and let their stories develop organically out of promising premises. That is a credible approach to storytelling, but keeping in mind that King's novels are often criticized for their abrupt and unsatisfying endings, maybe not the best one to follow--and certainly not an appropriate one for every novelist.    While none of the writing advice upended me and neither did the autobiographical bits (King never delves fully into his most fascinating experiences, like his drug addiction), there are enough nuggets to make the book a worthwhile read. Most of all, I enjoyed getting an honest look inside the head of a blockbuster author.
B002JIEYL2|5.0|My title isn't meant to be a knock on their previous 4 albums, but Sabbath Bloody Sabbath is, well...different, but different in a good way.    You have your heavy stuff, like the title track and \\"A National Acrobat\\".  And then comes along \\"Fluff\\", a great acoustic intrumental that shows a softer side of Sabbath.  Tony Iommi's guitar work is great on that track.  \\"Sabbra Cadabra\\" blends the trademark Sabbath sound with some psychedelic elements.  The second half of the album has a more experimental sound to it, with \\"Killing Yourself To Live\\" and \\"Spiral Architect\\" being the best tracks in the second half.    This is also a great re-master - nothing is mixed too loud, and you won't hear clipping like you do on other re-mastered CDs.  Highly recommended
B0026P3G12|5.0|She could sing anything . . . and I would be in awe of her.  Needed more verses to, \\"How Great Thou Art\\", but just want to hear more of her.  I'm a fan.
B003K025TQ|5.0|Grab a cool one, sit back and relax and enjoy an array of pieces ranging from blues, rock, classic, you name it.  I LOVE this CD!  Great driving tunes and also a good one to listen to when you are entertaining.  A must CD to round out any music collection.  Awesome!
9889979942|5.0|The images in this book are honest and impactful. You can see the emotion in the eyes of the portraits. There is a raw but soft edge to these pictures... one that not many can capture in a camera lens.     Impressive. Highly recommended.
B000QFW7UA|5.0|This is the one I have been waiting for (outside of all of the Star Wars and extended cut LOTR) on Blu ray!!!! This is awesome!!!

B001DF68MA|5.0|I have a K2 hybrid bike I use to commute around town.  The handle bars mount in a similar way as a mountain bike.  This carrier fits well.  It is easy to install.  The padding is good (I read a review that complained about the padding quality).  The seat belt is also good - it is a nice harness that goes over both shoulders of the child & has padding (there was also one bad review of the seat belt).  I do need to pedal with my knees slightly futher apart than normal, but it is only a minor change & still quite comfortable to ride.  The actual seat position can be adjusted an inch or two, which allows you to personalize the fit.  I am ~6ft tall & ride a normal, adult-sized bike.    Overall this is a great product.  The negative reviews were most likely from those who purchased the non-LTD model (less padding, fewer features).  The LTD is worth the few extra $$.    We love it!
0061438294|4.0|I give this book credit for being a very quick read, and right to the point.  There are plenty of pictures (to specifically illustrate a posture or expression), and there are plenty of sidebars in which the author uses 'real-world' stories and cases to really drive home a point.<br /><br />That said, if you have any truly legitimate and worth-while formal training in law enforcement or interrogation these days, then you will not find much new here.  That's not to say it's not a good book or read.  It's just not an advanced study.<br />All that aside, if you take the book at face value (speed reading people), you are likely to find it an interesting read.

B003HARV3Y|4.0|this movie arrived quickly, in excellent packaging, and safely.  it was extremely entertaining.  i am one who did not previously read the book.  i did, however, really enjoy this movie.  it was very professionally done in at least 95% of the movie.  i was quickly able to bond with the protagonists and felt myself sitting forward, holding the chairs tightly during the most action packed scenes.  since we knew in advance what # of confrontations the protagonists and antagonists would have, i was a little disappointed that there weren't too many surprises beyond the start of each confrontation.  also, it seemed that after the first confrontation, the thrill declined.  the end was not the triumph that, in my mind, paralleled the beginning.  still, the actors were excellent, props were generally excellent, and i found that this was a very good, action-packed, violent, non-sexual movie that the family has watched together several times.  i give this movie a \\"B+\\" and i recommend it.
B003LXM1RS|5.0|This album is so much fun. I was a little put off at first, but it has REALLY grown on me. The tunes are exciting, dark, sexy and fantastic. It totally has that 80s new wave vibe to it. GET IT!
1402217722|4.0|I absolutely loved this extremely delightful and charming novel. It is well-written and exceptionally descriptive, with a liberal dose of humour (evocative of Sheridan's `The School for Scandal'). Another feature which I admired is the historical accuracy (which, unfortunately, is not met by many contemporary `historical' fictions)- the fashion, entertainments, geographies, and even the language stay true to the Georgian era.     The prestigious and noble Winwood family, albeit impoverished (thanks to the ill-effects of gambling), have much to be thankful for when the wealthy and handsome Earl of Rule offers to `address' the eldest and most beautiful daughter Elizabeth. Elizabeth unwillingly accepts to hear Rule's addresses for she is deeply in love with a childhood friend, Lt. Edward Heron, who hails from an excellent but more impoverished family. Her predicament compels the youngest Winwood sister Horatia (or Horry) to save her sister by `sacrificing' herself. She secretly visits Rule to propound an alternative solution to the dilemma (which he wasn't aware of, in any case): Rule should marry her instead of Elizabeth (or Charlotte). Of course, she (being tiny, dark haired, and with thick, straight, and dark eyebrows..... oh, and a stammer) is a far cry from Elizabeth, but she presents solid reasons. Although it did seem as if their age difference (he is 35, she is 17) might pose a problem, Rule (who is amused, especially by her candour and foibles) eventually assents. The two reach an agreement on a purely marriage of convenience, with Horry promising not to interfere with his life, provided he becomes Lt. Heron's patron.     Soon after, Rule and Horry tie the knot, honeymoon in Paris, and return back to London. And the hilarious drama begins, with a few individuals keen on creating discord for the newly-weds: Rule's mistress, the beautiful and scheming widow Lady Caroline Massey, who certainly hoped that she would be the next Countess of Rule; infamous nemesis Lord Robert Lethbridge, who yearns for revenge against Rule; and Rule's cousin and heir presumptive, the truly comical, vain, and cowardly Crosby Drelincourt, who was hoping to succeed to the earldom.    Admittedly, there are some drawbacks. The characters are not explored in depth, there are quite a few times when the plot is unconvincing (including, the growing romance between Marcus and Horry), and the ending is quite predictable.     But if you need a light, humorous, melodramatic, and engaging novel to cheer you up and take you back to the Georgian times, don't look any further!
0394827996|4.0|A tadpole and a minnow grow up together, thinking they both are fish.  But one day, the tadpole begins to sprout legs and realizes that he's a frog.  After arguing with his friend who is reluctant to believe him, the tadpole declares \\"Frogs are frogs and fish is fish and that's that!\\"  Eventually, the day comes when the tadpole is a frog and must leave the water and his friend.  Weeks later, he returns to visit and tells his friend about all the wonders he's seen, such as birds, which the minnow pictures as fish with wings stuck on them, and so on.  These images stay in the minnow's mind, and the grass seems greener, so to speak, outside of his pond.  The fish jumps on land, only to discover that he is not made to live outside of water.  His friend helps him back in, and as the water revives him, the minnow looks around his home anew and decides to be content with his home.    The writing in this book is quite well done.  It contains both humor and life lessons that can be easily explained to a preschool-aged child.  Contentment, each having our own purpose/design, etc.  The color illustrations are rather plain for my tastes, with the exception of the minnow's imaginings about the creatures described, which are very bright by comparison.    This book was given to my daughter for her 5th birthday.  She says she'd rate it a 10 out of 10, and her 7-year-old sister says she'd give a 9 out of 10.  They both do enjoy hearing it read.  It's not one of their top 5 books, but it's one that they enjoy hearing from time to time.  As for my experience as a parent reading it, I don't enjoy reading it in the way I do some of my favorite, but it's not a chore either.  Overall, I would recommend this book if it sounds like one you and your child would enjoy.
B000TLMWMY|1.0|There is no indication until you buy it, that this is one of those PBS specials that you can watch (and record) for free on PBS. Once you buy it you see a sticker on the shrink-wrap, \\"As seen on PBS.\\" Deceptive advertising in my opinion. This is NOT just the Johnny Cash TV Show. It is a documentary about the 60's - anti-war protests, hippies, etc. So if you're looking for Country Music, well, yes, it's there, but you also get a lot of propaganda. Oh well, caveat emptor I guess.[[ASIN:B000TLMWMY The Johnny Cash Show: The Best of Johnny Cash 1969-1971]]
B001RTP48Q|5.0|Let's cut to the chase: almost every song on this album is good.  And I'd pay $15 just for this one masterful song: 'The Way it Used to Be.'  A masterpiece of a song on a PSB album that is solid all the way thru ....
630514415X|3.0|This movie had great potential, but much of it didn't make sense, especially all the background music/sounds. If Shuttleworth can get his son to go to the alma matter of the warden, then his time will be reduced. Throughout the movie, his son (Ray Allen) is tempted by outside influences to attend different schools. He hates his father because he accidentally killed his mother when he was child. The movie is okay, not great, but okay. I remember this movie when it came out, so I decided to just add to my blu ray/DVD collection. Not the best acting ever, but we all know this...........    the future HOF Ray Allen, the icon Denzel Washington.............      they both got game.

0345495004|4.0|Nancy Horan's book was an interesting take on the life of Frank Lloyd Wright and Mamah Cheney's life. Her book flowed well.The layers of these two fascinating educated and strong willed people was well defined in the book. This couple was in love but lived two seperate lives without making conditions on each other. She wanted her freedom and had a price to pay for it.<br />  I kept thinking about the women's movement and how far we have not come since that point. Mamah Cheney seemed to make soo many sacrafices to achieve happiness in her own right. She wanted to stay true to her deep seated dreams without losing her children in the process. I felt a deep sadness reading about her journey and how imposing life's nuances can be for any woman. The end is tragic given her coming to a point where she seemed most happiest living with Frank Lloyd Wright. I went to the library after reading this book to view all of the architecture of Wright's because this book described his unflinching goal of art meets nature. I felt this book stimulated an education of architect I might not have otherwise received. Thank- you Nancy Horan. I can't wait for your next novel.
0738711500|5.0|I would be very happy to review this book, but unfortunately I still haven't received it! I'm afraid there's another tarot lover at the post office who has stolen my book, cause a few months ago I didn't receive 2 tarot decks, either. This has actually never happened in the past, I have ordered a lot the last many years! Nevertheless, I give it 5 stars, because I'm sure it is an awesome book!
B0034JKZ86|5.0|My boys ages 21 months, 4.5, & 6.5 really enjoyed this disney film. It is very colorful w/ beautiful animation set in New Orleans. Lots of songs throughout to keep the little ones interested. Good story and happy ending as well. About an hour and 40 minutes long. I'd recommend it, may purchase if price falls. Wide-screen image (1.78:1) fills the whole TV screen !
B00275EHIM|4.0|i have not played nor seen the the video game that this movie is apparently based on,so i can't say whether it does it justice or not.however,i can say i enjoyed it immensely.not only is it very exciting and fast paced,but it's also(intentionally)very funny at times Jake Gyllenhaal bulked up a fair amount here and is very convincing as an action hero.Gemma Arterton plays the love interest/sidekick and is also very good.she and Gyllenhaal have good chemistry.Alfred Molina is a scream and steals every scene he is in.Ben Kinsgley is great as well.this movie was way better than i anticipated,plus i saw it a $3 theatre.for me,Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time is a 4/5
B002ZG997C|2.0|Bottom line: everything is magic and stop asking questions.  I decided to give this movie two stars for this simple reason: it earned one because it's horrible and then I gave it another one for being able to trick me into actually going to the theatre to see it.    No spoilers review:  This movie is decent if you don't take things too seriously and just want something stupid to look at for a couple hours to waste time. It's marginally entertaining, just don't expect the plot to hold up to even the lightest of probing.    Spoilers review *Don't read if you don't want it ruined*:  I knew I was going to be in trouble when I saw Mila Kunis as her acting is usually pretty inexcusable, but I have to give her credit on this one. For once she wasn't the problem.  I prefer apocalyptic films like The Road, where the main character is not an infallible super-god casually hacking and blasting his way through a sea of enemies like this was Resident Evil on easy mode or something. So I was almost immediately slightly disappointed. Nothing is a challenge for Eli. He could murder rapists with both arms tied behind his back.  And of course the movie uses that tired old premise where one dusty old loner picks up a sidekick against his will and then instantly warms up to them and would do anything to protect them...    *Serious spoilers! Beware*  The most annoying twist in the whole movie is when Eli turns out to be blind and everything that he did in the movie up to that point is all because of magic, I suppose. Your guess is as good as mine. There is no way he could have done half the stuff he did in the film up to that point without his sight (hunting a completely silent cat with a bow and arrow), so the answer must be magic!    The movie really \\"jumped the shark\\" when Eli's bible is destroyed and with his last dying breath he must dictate a new one to Malcolm McDowell. I guess being blind also gives you incredible time control powers, because it would take forever to dictate thebible to someone. To say nothing of the fact that one man would never be able to memorize the entire thing! I'm guessing this was an extremely paraphrased (IE completely made up) version.    It's like someone had a very, very vague idea for a movie and no one felt like ironing out a plot first, so they said, \\"Let's just start filming and we'll come up with something as we go.\\"
B001GCUO4S|2.0|but i doubt this will be the final installment.these things are so cheap to make,what with their no name actors.maybe i'm just getting old,but i found myself bored out of my skull with this thing.i guess maybe i'm just not all that entertained by people dying in gross,disgusting ways anymore.that and i just found it all too absurd.not too mention the story is old hat.at slightly less than ninety minutes,this thing is slightly less than ninety minutes too long,in my opinion.for the fourteen to mid twenty crowd,i guess this might hold some value,and yes,it would have for me,at that age,and even beyond.until recently in fact.it's only been maybe three years since i realized i wanted more from my movie experience.one thing's for sure,when the next installment comes around,that's one destination i won't be going on.for me,The Final Destination is a 2/5
0307454541|5.0|[[ASIN:0307454541 The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo]]<br /><br />Definitely a book you won't put down until the end - and then you'll find the clever segue to the next volume in the trilogy - so well written and with such surprising (but logical if you think about it) twists the reader is carried on a cloud in a world in Sweden (and that is new, too) that makes the most of technology, high risks, romance, and all of those other human emotions that build a great story.  Run, don't walk, to your first volume, but be sure the next two are close at hand, lest you feel incomplete when the first is done.  Don't stop to sleep, you won't need it!

B0001Z52RU|5.0|I LOVED THIS MOVIE.  I think our current understanding of the known universe(s)/multiverse and quantum theory supports the idea that such an event like this could really happen.  People think time travel, impossible, and it gets a lot of bad reviews.  People need to think bigger, be more open to the universe, and accept that we're not the center of it.  We should at least consider the possibility, especially in light of what physics (more directly, quantum physics) is saying about reality; and the fact that we have yet to disprove it indefinitely.
B000002KON|5.0|Another proof that Ray Davies is a genius. He was 24 when he wrote this. How matured and gifted. A fantastic story, in music and words, about the English workingclass adventure and destiny. And the heart is at the right place. Somebody should make a movie or a musical out of this.
B002HWRYJE|4.0|Saw the movie in the theater and loved it.  Bought the DVD and still love it.  A a classic trekker I was cautiously optimistic when the movie came out. Now I am sold on the idea of altering a few things and seeing how it all works out, this time around.<g>
B0006AAS5G|2.0|The Amazon description of the movement was wrong, and all this time later is still wrong. Beware anyone who wants this watch to be a chronograph. Unlike any quartz movement I know, the large center hand is the seconds hand, while the tiny dial at 6 o'clock contains the chrono second hand. You can't time anything that way. Further, the tachymeter cannot be used, for obvious reasons.    If you want a watch that looks like a chronograph but behaves like a regular watch, then buy this one. But if you want a chronograph, stay away.    The description doesn't reveal any of this. It actually says it measures time to within 1/60th of a second!    Very disappointing. Only got a second star because Amazon took it back and paid return shipping.
B00005LOUQ|1.0|Well first off I believe this DVD is coming from Canada.. Which is cool, except for the fact that it took maybe a MONTH to be delivered !!!!!

So No this grinch movie is NOT getting a good review from me,'matter of fact it's not the movie it's the whole company they got going on there!!! So BEWARE u might as well pay the $2-3 extra bucks for the original made in USA store or even walmart bought !!!

0316776963|1.0|I wish I had read the one star reviews before buying this book. They are right --  it wasn't funny, wasn't cohesive, wasn't interesting.  I had to force myself to read to page 50, hoping it would redeem itself, but I finally gave up.  There are way too many good books out there to waste my time trying to get through this one.
1597801585|3.0|Fairly well written, the novel presents a fascinating and scary future.  It was very hard to put down once I started.  A minor flaw is that the technology and wind-up \\"motors\\" wouldn't quite work as good as presented.  This and the ending, which wound down, results in only a three star rating.
9889979942|5.0|I have been lucky enough to follow Tom Carter via email on his travels in China and all I can say is his photos are AWESOME!  This book is a must-have for anyone with an interest in China.    I am currently living in Shanghai and only wish I could capture the life here the way Tom does.  He has such an eye for a photo and what is more incredible is that many of his photos are taken with a point & shoot camera.      Tom has beautifully captured a moment in time. China is changing rapidly, but there are many things that stay the same; the beauty, culture, and people.  By traveling through all 33 provinces, Tom has managed to do something I can only dream of.  I am so thankful that through Tom's lens, I too can experience all 4 corners of this amazing country without leaving home.    My biggest disappointment is that since I am traveling in August, I will not get to meet Tom in person and hear all about his amazing journey when he comes to Shanghai as guest speaker. (see author page for details)    I will be buying at least two copies of this book for my two younger children who were adopted from China in 2004 & 2006.  It will make a great addition to our family library and will help them understand the beauty and diversity of their birth culture and country.    Be sure to check Tom Carter's website for details on his travels and to see images from his upcoming book on India.    [...]
B002VPE1Z2|3.0|Amazon apparently is now branding some manufactured products with their own name.  Perhaps this has been going on a while, I don't know.<br /><br />The AmazonBasics Universal Camera Case for Digital Cameras HF (Black) (whew!) is a simple bag with clean lines.  It's supposedly made for a digital camera but my film point-n-shoot goes in fine as well.<br /><br />I like the fact that it is generously-sized.  Some bags are just too tight for all but the thinnest cameras.  This one is made to take a number of different camera sizes.  For example, my old Vivitar 3.3 mega fits perfectly.  This is an older camera that is fat and a bit clunky.  My Olympus 35mm fits snugly, and my late-model Canon point-n-shoot, though much smaller than the first two, fits as well.  Even an old Kodak 110 camera fits fine.<br /><br />The case does have a zipper, but surprisingly it's just on the small pouch on the front of the case.  It's perfect for a memory card, or batteries.  It's nice that it is an expanding pouch, so it could hold AAA batteries and a couple of SD cards without a problem.<br /><br />It has a velcroed belt loop in the back, so you can thread your belt through it, and have it securely attached to yourself.<br /><br />My only concern with the bag is that your camera is only held in by the velcro attachment that holds the bag flap down.  I like bags with a zippered opening; it feels much more secure than velcro.  And I worry more about the velcro belt loop attachment!  I assumed the belt loop was stitched on both sides, but it's only stitched at the top!  I'd worry about an expensive camera falling out if you were bending over, or bicycling, or being at all active with the camera attached to your belt.  I'd prefer a zipper or at least a solid snap or other closure.  Some cameras fit so snugly that they won't just fall out, but cameras are getting smaller and smaller, and with only velcro, I'd worry.<br /><br />I thing a good course of action is to get the old needle and thread out, and put a few stitches in the bottom velcro of the belt loop.  I know that sort of defeats the purpose of the easy-on, easy-off idea, but I think it's just too easy to have the entire case just fall off!<br /><br />On the other hand, it's very handy to have the camera quickly available for picture-taking.  One doesn't have to fumble with a zipper to get the camera out.<br /><br />All-in-all, a fine bag and a simple, functional design.  No fru-fru here.  Just clean lines and a simple look to the bag.<br /><br />Recommended only for an inexpensive camera, or one that fits tightly into the bag, and that's if you aren't moving around a lot.  Otherwise, get a more expensive bag.  Two stars for this if you are depending on it to protect an expensive camera (stitch the bottom belt loop, or just throw the camera in case in your luggage).  It's just too risky for me.<br /><br />Workmanship is very good, straight stitching, no frayed threads hanging out, that sort of thing.  However, I'd worry about the closure material.  Just like a bowl of chocolate ice cream, velco doesn't last forever.  I have a cell phone case that closes with velcro, and it's won't hardly attach anymore.  I suppose you could just go out and buy a new bag, but that sort of defeats the purpose that made you buy the bag in the first place.o of the belt loop.

B0015DROBO|3.0|I wanted to give my thoughts on the book. There are many other reviews that describe how I feel about the book, like Lee Goldberg's review here \\"Cliche-ridden, exposition heavy dud\\"<br /><br />The most fascinating thing I found about the book was COFFEE. WOW do the Swedes like coffee. The author mentions coffee on every page in every context he could.<br />Would you like a cup of coffee<br />Please put on a pit of coffee<br />Blomvkist was having a cup of cofee as he read his notes<br />At the cafe he sat watching outside as he had his coffee<br />They warmed up the cold coffee at 11pm and discussed the matter<br />COFFEE COFFEE COFFEE<br /><br />Oh about the real topic of the book. Yes the book has some pretty violent and graphic material but, don't many books? What's so special about the heroine? She's a hacker - BIG DEAL.<br /><br />The main male character seems to be a Don Juan type and he has to try and have sex with any woman he comes into contact with? All men in this book come off as sadists and women haters, but I guess that's ok since the real title of the book in Sweden was Men Who Hate Women.<br /><br />As for the whole murder mystery, I find it quite implausible, once the whole mystery is revealed, that the murders could go on for so long without no one knowing anything into the matter. It seems HIGHLY implausible something like this could have gone on for so long. In the end, maybe I am just out of touch with this book.<br /><br />You really need to read all reviews especially the highest-rated negative review. I agreed with that negative review more than the highly positive one.<br /><br />Frankly, I'm quite shocked women love this book so much. I won't even bother reading the next two books in the series. I have no desire and there are many other books I'll want to read.
B0000CAXID|1.0|This is probally what Nirvana would sound like today anyway but this band sucks, just pop rock modern day crap.
185326895X|5.0|I posted these comments in response to one of amazon's top 500 reviewers whose review can basically be summed up as \\"Shakespeare is old hat, I don't like him, and therefore he deserves to be forgotten.\\"  Since I have seen other reviews of Shakespeare on amazon that take the form of \\"Shakespeare?  Yecch.  Now, Top Gun, that's something worth seeing!,\\" I thought I would post these comments as their own review.  Just writing these comments has rekindled my enthusiasm for the great Bard, not that it needed rekindling.<br /><br />By the way, I think this edition, as several have pointed out, has a real place on the bookshelf of the Shakespeare lover.  One way I enjoy reading Shakespeare is while following along with a recording, of which fortunately there have been many good ones, going back at least as far as the wonderful Argo series back in the 1950s and 1960s, and completed in time for the 400th anniversary of the Bard's birth in 1964.  When following with an annotated edition, I am way too tempted to keep checking the notes.  When following with this or another bare-bones text, the temptation is automatically gone.<br /><br />Now, on to my comment:<br /><br />I deleted my original comments some time ago, having realized that I couldn't respond to Jmark's lengthy remarks about Shakespeare in just a few pithy words, and so I only ended up misrepresenting myself and Shakespeare (not that he needs me to defend him).  I resolved to make a lengthier, more reasoned, and less personal response to Jmark's diatribe at a future date.<br /><br />Having re-read Jmark's review and his responses to my remarks, and deduced what I must have originally said in the comments I deleted, I still am of the opinion that his arguments don't hold water.  His essential argument is that \\"I don't like Shakespeare and therefore he deserves to be relegated to the trash heap.\\"  Certainly Jmark is entitled not to like Shakespeare, just as I am entitled not to like Michael Jackson; it's the \\"therefore\\" part that makes no sense.  To answer his assertions one by one:<br /><br />1)  If Shakespeare were not a vital author, nobody past the age of being influenced by the educational system would pay any attention to him.  Certainly he would have been forgotten ages ago since the teachers who had been forced to read him when going through the deluded educational system would have rebelled against the idea of teaching such claptrap when they joined that system.<br /><br />2)  \\"Silly romances,\\" \\"boring dramas,\\" \\"improbable plots,\\" \\"vulgar jokes\\" are all value judgments and relate back to Jmark's \\"I don't like Shakespeare\\" thesis (well, some of the jokes *are* pretty vulgar).  If Jmark finds the romances silly and the dramas boring, he certainly has a right to.  I doubt I've ever judged a play, movie, opera, etc. (especially opera) on the probability of its plot.  I love Crank also and it's probably fairly improbable, although I don't expect folks to be watching Crank 400 years from now, assuming that civilization hasn't self-destructed by then; as for Crank 2, well once was enough given the level of its violence.  I look at how well the story is told; Jmark and I will have to agree to disagree on this one.<br /><br />3)  Actually, the \\"nuts\\" do get to have it both ways.  On the one hand, Shakespeare does deserve to be approached with a certain degree of reverence, which doesn't take Jmark's comments about \\"no one must dare question\\" out of the realm of hyperbole.  And on the other hand, the plays themselves *are* entertaining, enormously so.  As two examples, and these from a couple of the lesser-known plays, I offer the scenes in Much Ado About Nothing where Beatrice and Benedict are tricked into believing that the other is in love with her/him or the ending of the Cymbeline where all the plot twists are more or less straightened out to the hilarity of the audience; actually, these are both pretty improbable which doesn't take away from their entertainment value.  I have kept to comic scenes here, although Cymbeline is usually classed among the tragedies or more recently among a new genre called the romances.  It would be just as easy to find entertaining scenes among the tragedies or the histories, and I'll let each person do that for him- or herself.  Actually, the comparison with Crank 2 is not completely off the wall; Titus Andronicus is at least as violent as Crank, but Shakespeare's poetry and the strength of some of the characterizations raise the play way above the level of Crank 2.<br /><br />4)  The comparison with Beowulf is patently unfair.  When reading Beowulf, one would need to have a glossary of every word in order to make sense of it at all.

It would be just as easy to find entertaining scenes among the tragedies or the histories, and I'll let each person do that for him- or herself.  Actually, the comparison with Crank 2 is not completely off the wall; Titus Andronicus is at least as violent as Crank, but Shakespeare's poetry and the strength of some of the characterizations raise the play way above the level of Crank 2.    4)  The comparison with Beowulf is patently unfair.  When reading Beowulf, one would need to have a glossary of every word in order to make sense of it at all.  In Shakespeare, only some words need to be glossed and, with a little experience, one will not need to check all of the glosses because a lot of the phrases and constructions are used over and over again.

0061998494|4.0|Great book by a smart and funny man.  Well written and enjoyable to read.  I really enjoyed learning about Craig's life and the journey he took to get where he is now. Very honest and open, especially the parts where he discusses his battle with alcoholism.
B000TXZVGQ|5.0|An absolutely brilliant, beautiful series.<br /><br />Box design is fine, as well as DVD set-up. Book is filled with interesting words & several nice photographs all in color.<br /><br />DVD content, is of course, wonderful.<br /><br />Despite it only lasting for nineteen episodes, I can watch this series again & again.
B003IKMR0U|5.0|This is a simple dice game that takes minutes to learn and can occupy you for hours.  It plays like a simplified version of with a Zombie twist.     Definitely a worthwhile buy.
B0019N8P2W|4.0|Just when I thought Daria was never going to come out on DVD we get a box set containing the entire series and the two movies. What could be better? Turns out not much.     Yes, they got rid of the original music. Yes, it takes away from the show and now the episodes feel unfinished. However, Daria is one of those shows that needs to be available to the masses. How many shows are as smart, sarcastic and funny as Daria? How many continue to hold up and be relevant more than a decade after cancellation? I do miss the original music, but this show was so much more than that and I'm glad it's finally out there to be experienced again.    For those looking to relive a piece of their childhood or need to experience something other than the multitude of reality programming constantly running on their TV.
B002BU0DPE|4.0|Ok, getting to it, the PX21 headset is awesome... for the money you pay. Now, I'm not saying that in a negative way. It's just the truth. Retailed at $79.99 it's a hell of a deal for a headset with the name Turtle Beach on it, with the capabilities of sound AND chat on both the PS3 and Xbox 360 (and PC and Mac as well, but come on, who cares? There are a few ups and downs though, so here it is.<br /><br />The pros: The headset has features that make chatting and playing a game more engaging. You can control not only the sound and chat volumes independently, but also the bass. That explosion didn't blow out your ear drum like you had hoped? Turn it up, and enjoy the hearing aid you'll be using from now on. And that is not over reacting. The volume of this set is intense. If you turn it up ¾ of the way and set the headphones next to you on the couch, you can clearly hear everything as if the TV's volume was on. It also features Chat Boost which automatically turns the volume up on chatting friends if you're in a loud gun fight for example. Speaking of chat, unlike the stock headset for 360, when you speak into the mic you can hear yourself loud and clear. So you can not only hear the level at which you're speaking, that greatly minimizes random screaming in the middle of the night waking up your wife or infant, but it also lets you hear yourself moan and cry when you keep getting shot in the head by campers. More pluses include USB power which means no batteries to recharge or replace, a mute button, and a stereo expander, that when turned on, makes the sound seem wider, surrounding you more instead of just straight up stereo sound.<br /><br />Speaking of stereo sound, on to the cons: A few things are going to hit you right off the bat. You will feel like the set is cheap. It's fairly flimsy especially after a couple of months of use when it gets worn in. It still feels like it will hold together nicely, but it just gives you the feeling you're going to break it when you're moving it around. Which is good or bad depending on the way you look at it. I'm the type of guy who needs to feel the weight of something. I appreciate that the set is light for the sake of comfort, but sometimes I just don't know my own strength. The clip for the amplifier box is notorious for breaking off due to poor manufacturing. Also a little gripe I had was at the end of the cord, the cable splits off to the USB connection and the audio jack connection. Well you have roughly 6 or 7 inches of leeway because it cannot be separated anymore than what it already is. Which means whatever you're connecting it to needs to be pretty close together or else you're going to need some extra cables to expand the length. Something else that I'm not sure is just me or not, but I had a problem with my cable that connects my amplifier box to the 360 controller. It was not picking up the mic and it was also causing another problem with the volume of the game vs the chat volume. Turtle Beach sent me a total of 3 cables with the final one being totally different with it's own little control box for volume on it. That worked like a charm and fixed all the problems that weren't from manufacturing. But honestly, before that cable came I was deeply regretting this set. So that little fix made all the difference in the world.<br /><br />Bottom line, the Turtle Beach PX21 is an awesome pair of headphones. Especially if this is your first pair, because what you get at this price you can't go wrong. Just don't go expecting 5.1 surround sound from these, remember, they are only stereo. I hinted earlier that stereo sound was a con, and it only is if you are used to playing in a 5.1 environment. This headset does pick up a lot of the sounds you wouldn't usually hear and it goes above and beyond if what you're looking for is something to let you play at night without waking anybody up. Aside from these few things I really can't find anything else wrong with it. They're comfortable even for someone with a big head like me, the mic sounds amazingly clear, you have complete control over all the sounds of the game, and it's affordable considering the price headsets that are fully functional on both consoles go for. I would go as far as saying this set is something every gamer needs. So unless you're really anal about sound and you just need something to help you play at night, these headphones are perfect for you. There's not much out there in this price range that does the things this set can do.<br /><br />Verdict:  4/5head like me, the mic sounds amazingly clear, you have complete control over all the sounds of the game, and it's affordable considering the price headsets that are fully functional on both consoles go for. I would go as far as saying this set is something every gamer needs. So unless you're really anal about sound and you just need something to help you play at night, these headphones are perfect for you.

B003K025TQ|5.0|Guitar Haiku #1<br />Gentle winds blowing<br />Soft sounds from metallic strings<br />Keep the night alive.<br />  -- Miss Bob Etier<br /><br />Few musicians of any genre can match the curriculum vitae of Grammy award winning guitarist Lee Ritenour. One of the founding members of monster jazz group, Fourplay, he has completed a project  inspired by B.B. King, that (after 40+ albums) may well be his masterpiece.  6 String Theory includes a fifteen track CD and a guitar competition (sponsored by Yamaha).<br /><br />Few genres were ignored, and we experience a collection of world class musicians from rock, blues, jazz, acoustic, country and classical who all share a common bond -- love of the guitar.  Spouses often complain that their mate is \\"married to their career\\" and certainly that could be said of the music industry.  However, have you ever heard of a man having a love affair with a fountain pen or a typewriter?  The feminine personification of the guitar is seldom better documented than with B.B. King and \\"Lucille\\".  It's impossible to consider his famous Gibson being named \\"Walter\\"!  These men checked their egos at the door to the studio and they all play with inspired passion.<br /><br />A special moment on 6 String Theory for Ritenour is George Benson's solo performance of \\"My One and Only Love\\".  According to Ritenour, \\"It exemplifies the higher purpose\\" of the project, to focus attention on the guitar. As a listener, there are fifteen special moments for me as each track presents diverse technicians speaking different languages and delivering their message with the music.  6 String Theory  is a listening experience that will send you scurrying to YouTube and Amazon to hear more of each artist.  It's great to hear familiar artists in a new light and welcome new stars onto the playlist.<br /><br />Lee Ritenour has assembled a group of twenty dedicated guitarists (including himself) with combined resumes second to none.  King, George Benson, Steve Lukather, Slash, Neal Schon, Jon Scofield, Robert Cray, Vince Gill, Keb'Mo', Taj Majal, Andy McKee, Mike Stern, Tomoyasu Hotei, Gutherie Govan, Joe Bonamassa and Johnny Lang are noteworthy members of the ensemble along with three more who deserve special mention.<br /><br />Ritenour had difficulty getting volunteers to join renowned jazz guitarist and teacher Pat Martino  (winner of Downbeat Magazine's 2004 reader's poll for jazz guitarist of the year) for a track. Were they intimidated by this legendary performer?  In the end, Ritenour himself penned a tribute song to Les Paul and the two masters trade solos in an up-tempo number that would make Paul proud.  Joey DeFrancesco on organ and Will Kennedy on drums round out this unique quartet. These two appear on other tracks and are fine examples of the support talent Ritenour has brought together for this recording.<br /><br />\\"Smokin'\\" Joe Robinson is the eighteen year old winner of 2008's  Australia's Got Talent.  He contributes one of his own compositions and solos on \\"Daddy Longlicks\\".  He should be on the guitar radar for years to come.<br /><br />Write this name down.  Shon Boublil is the sixteen year old winner of Yamaha's 6 String Theory Competition.  His winnings include a four year scholarship to Berklee Collge of Music as well as a track on 6 String Theory, \\"Caprices, OP.20, No. 2 and 7.\\"  Boublil took first place honors  with a flawless performance of an extremely difficult classical piece, alone on a stage before the judges, showing no fear.

B0000A118M|5.0|There's always some lame so-called music \\"critic\\", so-called \\"blogger\\" or whatever that thinks he or she has the credentials to trash someone's musical talents. Well, there are a few of those \\"haters\\" who reviewed this masterpiece from Coltrane. Jazz has always been experimental. Miles, Monk, Byrd & Coltrane made their bones pressing the envelope with their interpretation (key words \\"their interpretation\\") of what jazz is. This is the problem with folks. Everything has to sound the same or fit perfectly inside some type of box. Music like art has unlimited boundaries to express a thought  or a sound as log as it's not offensive. Throughout history, musical giants such as Bach, Mozart, Beethovan, the jazz legends mentioned above & countless names of others in other musical genres (rock n roll, r&b, hip hop, ect.) have had \\"critics\\" try to silence their greatness with their misinformed reviews. I have a question. Name me one \\"critic\\" just one that has produced a musical masterpiece that will stand the test of time? Hum, let me guess...none! \\"Critics\\" are the ones who didn't have the stuff to be legends so they unfortunately became \\"critics\\" or college professors :)
1936041065|5.0|Hesse poses and answers the great philosophical and religious questions for everyman in a mere 100 pages.  He fairly outlines the various paths to knowledge, wisdom and salvation in the life of Siddhartha and his friend Govinda, a classic pair of seekers.  Eastern and Western, classic and modern answers are considered and lived.<br />There is no simple answer to the question \\"what is the meaning of life?\\" or \\"how do I lead a good life?\\"<br />Simple asceticism and hedonism don't work.  Escapism does not work.  Following a religious tradition or leader are only partial answers.  The path for one person is different from the path for others.  Random and unexplained events are inherent in life.  Wisdom is learned through experience rather than from texts.  We often don't know what we don't know.  Appearances may be deceiving, but the underlying form or soul is not everything.<br />The solitary individual can not learn meaning or control his own life.  The community, friends and family are necessary for understanding and living.  Love is a cardinal virtue and experience.  Sharing and giving are a good practices.  Life is a journey and new learning is possible throughout.  Individuals should not try to control the world.  Hesse's main conclusion is Eastern, but stated in a way that can be used by religious and secular Western thinkers.  The individual is part of the community.  The individual experience is part of a more global experience.  Current experience is linked to the past and the future.  Hesse writes that life has meaning for individuals living in time because that experience is integrally connected with all of time and reality.  This can be partially known and embraced.<br />In a post-rational, existential world, Hesse's story provides some comfort and hope in a time where wisdom is elusive.

B000TGJ7ZY|5.0|In the medieval ages of Transylvania, Captain Vlad (Gary Oldman) was a Christian knight who defended God's church until he found out his former love (Winoa Ryder) died until he renounces his faith to come back as a servant of Satan called Dracula where he will bring death and vampirism to Europe. Years later in 1897, London lawyer Jonathan Harker (Keanu Reeves) heads to Transylvania to do paperwork for Count Dracula that is until he becomes his prisoner especially for the sexy minions. Dracula travels to London in search for fresh blood until he sees a lovely woman who happens to be Jonathan's fiancee Mina (Wiyona Ryder) who resembles his old love. Once he bites Mina's lovely friend Lucy (Sadie Frost) she becomes damned and Dr. Abraham Van Helsing (Anthony Hopkins) must try to track down the prince of darkness.<br /><br />A faithful and unique adaptation of Bram Stoker's timeless novel is one of the better Dracula movies even though both \\"Dracula (1931)\\" and \\"Nosferatu (1922)\\" with \\"Horror of Dracula\\" are the best Dracula movies ever this is good in it's own right as is 1973's version, 1979's version and 1970's Jess Franco's version. The film co-stars Cary Elwes, Richard Grant, Bill Campbell and Tom Waits with Monica Bellucci this version is hypnotic, stylish and exciting. The film does get gory at times and has some sleaze but i gotta say that director Francis Ford Coppola grew up with the story as he gave his devotion to it. Though i still think Reeves is kind of miscasted as Jonathan but the rest of the cast is solid as this is a poetic adaptation that appeals to vampire film fanatics.<br /><br />This Blu-Ray offers the movie in a sharper and better looking version than ever with perfect sound with great extras like featurettes, a introduction by Mr. Coppola and commentary by him, deleted scenes plus teaser and trailers to this movie.

B0001FR3IQ|2.0|Halle Berry is brilliant as a doctor who ends up imprisoned for murder in the very mental institute where she works. Were it not for Berry this movie would have completely flopped.<br /><br />If you suspend belief and don't attempt to decipher the details or figure out the ending, you should enjoy this movie... somewhat. I had two plausible endings in my mind, neither of which played out. Unfortunately for this thriller, my endings were better. Yours will be too.<br /><br />What's real? What isn't? Is Berry insane and guilty of murder? You'll never know until the climax starts to unravel. No doubt, it will leave you feeling relieved that you rented this movie instead of paying to see it in the theater.<br /><br />The flick is loaded with spectral ghosts, flashing lights, creepy actors and atmosphere. The acting is quite good, as is the photography. It's really a shame that it dropped the ball and gave us the ending that it did. There was nothing to set us up for that surprise. It came out of thin air, which always disappoints and insults moviegoers. It's a shame really. This could have been a five-star flick.<br /><br />Despite the drawbacks, Berry's performance is worth the rental cost, so long as you don't expect much.

Then there was his so-so children's album The Pied Piper in 2002 with mostly older songs redone for children. Here he takes some of his older unrealesed material and does it in a new setting that evokes boheminan lifestyle. The songs \\"Poorman's Sunshine\\" and \\"Lord of the Universe\\" were written back in 1968 but were never released until the reissue of [[ASIN:B00081MUYU Barabajagal]] \\"Two Lovers\\" is based on one of Don's love poems (for Linda who else?)

B001KVZ6F2|2.0|I enjoyed most of this film.  However, I agree with others that the film relies on contrivances and an unoriginal storyline.  It seems that the writer felt that the film had two possible ways to go:  One way could be the \\"Dirty Harry\\" route where Eastwood brilliantly gets violent revenge on the bad guys...Or, the other possible ending could be melodramatic with much hanky-wringing and a \\"message\\".  Neither option is appealing given the age and health of the main character...and the values he was trying to teach the young man.  There was a huge missed opportunity to tell a different story based on the certain realities that each of the characters must accept. This could have been a great film...Instead it's just more of the same.

This series is an excellent recitation of some of the best Jeeves novels; Jonathan Cecil does a fine job of narration.  My only wish would be that the series be expanded beyond the Jeeves corpus -- although the Jeeves stories are undoubtedly the most famous of his works, there is much more of Wodehouse's work that is every bit as good.  Still, you won't go wrong with this excellent adaptation.

B001OQCV2O|5.0|This is fun, well composed, and decently done picture. It delivers GREAT and BELIEVABLE catastrophe and while one can find some cliche here and there, IT IS ENJOYABLE movie and that what matters. You can't expect some terrific acting or massive, deep character development, but they all are well done. You getting a very believable sketch  of various characters, some of them are well developed and realistically heroic in their ways. There's very science provoking swing to the core of the entire story. I would agree with critics that ending is little too much, but it is the way of the genre. In short, it is one of the greatest catastrophe movies ever filmed.
B00003Q438|3.0|What else can be said about James Cameron that hasent already been said? Well, how about this....he is a dual-edged sword. On the one hand, you have a master craftsman in all areas of filmmaking, screenwriting, and forward-thinking technical/visual excellence, vision, and ambition. It would be difficult to think of too many individuals who are in that same league.<br /><br />But at the same time, you have a very cheesy (ya, I said it!) individual who populates his films and screenplays with the same unbelievable stereotypes over and over again. The dialog is beyond corny, the storyline is nothing more then variations on extremely common (and tired) themes we've seen since the early days of film. He makes movies for the masses, and the masses are hungry. Hungry for what? Cheese, of course. They like their fromage any way they can get it. Do his films suck because of this? Oh farts no. But are they unique stories with complex, interesting, or true-to-life characters that turn a passive bit of entertainment into an experience which enriches your life in some way other then having a semi-thrilling 2+ hours spent sitting on your bloated rear end? Some would say no.<br /><br />But in his defense, I strongly doubt he'd call himself a master of unique and/or artistic storytelling. He makes entertaining action films which nearly always push the envelope of what is technically (and financially!) possible at that time.<br /><br />The Abyss shows him at his best, and excelling in those areas where he is quite possibly second to none. To call this film ambitious would be a massive understatement. But dont take my word for it, watch the endless (and highly informative/entertaining) bonus features on the second disc. When this film was made, it might have been historically, the most difficult film ever produced.<br /><br />But I must say, the usual Cameron cheesiness finds multiple opportunities to make you say \\"oh what, stop it\\"! I remember when I saw this in the theater, during one particular scene, a man somewhere in the theater screamed out \\"oh get the F%$K out of here!\\".<br /><br />An entertaining film, nonetheless.<br /><br />On a semi-unrelated rant, to those who maintain his sequel to Alien is better then the original directed by Ridley Scott...please shut your pie-holes and feed another slice of delicious chocolate cake into it. The original, made for only 8 million, was a ground-breaking film in terms of it's affect on that genre. Some would say it was the most imitated sci-fi/thriller/monster film ever made, and I would have to agree with that. Cameron's infinitely more expensive version certainly wasnt bad at all. Damn great, actually. But whom do we applaud? Most of what Cameron used in his sequel, were more expensive versions of the same themes and gimmicks that worked so well in the original.<br /><br />...but with the addition of cheesy dialog. He merely expanded upon a superb film with great special effects (for the time).<br /><br />There you have it.<br /><br />In this reviewers opinion, James Cameron is absolutely inhuman in terms of a brutally masterful technician and director, but an average storyteller/artist/writer (at best). Makes one sort of wonder though, how shockingly different things would be if this mans talent matched his skills...in all areas! You'd end up with films so bowel-shakingly and disturbingly good, that you'd possibly get diarrhea from the sheer brilliance of it.<br /><br />I hope such an individual is never born, I dont think the average movie-goer would be able to take it.<br /><br />Cheers.mewhere in the theater screamed out \\"oh get the F%$K out of here!\\".    An entertaining film, nonetheless.    On a semi-unrelated rant, to those who maintain his sequel to Alien is better then the original directed by Ridley Scott...please shut your pie-holes and feed another slice of delicious chocolate cake into it. The original, made for only 8 million, was a ground-breaking film in terms of it's affect on that genre. Some would say it was the most imitated sci-fi/thriller/monster film ever made, and I would have to agree with that. Cameron's infinitely more expensive version certainly wasnt bad at all. Damn great, actually. But whom do we applaud? Most of what Cameron used in his sequel, were more expensive versions of the same themes and gimmicks that worked so well in the original.    ...but with the addition of cheesy dialog. He merely expanded upon a superb film with great special effects (for the time).    There you have it.    In this reviewers opinion, James Cameron is absolutely inhuman in terms of a brutally masterful technician and director, but an average storyteller/artist/writer (at best). Makes one sort of wonder though, how shockingly different things would be if this mans talent matched his skills...in all areas! You'd end up with films so bowel-shakingly and disturbingly good, that you'd possibly get diarrhea from the sheer brilliance of it.    I hope such an individual is never born, I dont think the average movie-goer would be able to take it.    Cheers.
0061876747|3.0|What is the author of The New Confessions, that masterpiece, and of such gems as The Blue Afternoon doing? The critics will no-doubt find many things that Ordinary Thunderstorms is 'about', but this is a plain thriller, and a cheap one at that.    Adam Kindred is an unwitting accessory to the murder of a researcher for a big pharma company. He decides to flee rather than try to explain things to the police. Tracked both by the authorities and the real murderer, he is forced to abandon everything and survive on the London streets. The novel follows his hair-raising odyssey. Never mind, though, that Kindred's original choice is dubious; the reader swallows that as an essential premise and moves on. Boyd makes beginner's blunders: how many coincidences is the reader going to tolerate? The woman cop who discovers the murder really has to run into him by chance another two times? In a city of ten million people? And the pharma conspiracy is for teenagers. Perhaps Boyd can't be faulted for not having firsthand boardroom experience, but he could at least open a financial newspaper once in a while. Ordinary Thunderstorms has nice portraits of underground London. But it is sustained throughout by one thing: the hero is in constant danger, making sure the reader turns the page however clumsy the plot gets. There are better-constructed thrillers. And if you are a fan of William Boyd, stick to his early works.
B003JIPJRE|4.0|Well done to Warner Bros. and team for putting out yet another solid DCU movie! I had a good feeling just from the covert art that this movie was going to be good and it did not disappoint. Overall the plot was good, animation was good, and the voice overs we're convincing. Even the music and sound effects were good. My only gripe would be that the directors pushed the envelope of reality a little too far at times; some scenes left me scratching my head in disbelief. Aside from that, the plot unfolds nicely and the movie kept me engaged the entire time. If you're a fan of the recent JL movies then you'll probably enjoy this too.
1932100385|5.0|Dr. Campbell is an astounding researcher with an astounding publication in The China Study. Don't let the title fool you - China has little to do with the story, but is the story behind Dr. Campbell's conclusions. The Western Diet of Affluence, as he calls it, is killing people. In fact, anyone who moves from an Eastern culture into a Western culture risks disease seldom heard of in his own country. It is this evidence that draws the reader into a certainty that what the book offers is true.     The China Study is NOT a recipe book for Asian foods or a guilt-inducing diatribe against meat. It is a readable book that has the power to educate and empower the reader to seek and control his own health using reason and research of the highest caliber, not advertisements and soft-money from drug and food companies. In fact, the eating recommendations are downright simple, tasty and satisfying. You'll start seeing advertising for foods and drugs for what they are - impersonal influences on your most personal possession - your health and happiness.    If you have an aversion to anything vegetarian, you should read this book, because it is likely that you are killing yourself in ignorance, and Dr. Campbell might persuade you to change what you eat so you can live without the Diseases of Affluence we in the West see and foolishly accept. If anything does not make sense in this book, Dr. Campbell recognizes it and addresses each topic in terms easily understood. Of particular interest are Dr. Campbell's descriptions and experiences in the \\"modern academic and medical worlds\\" which are thoroughly vested in using drugs and surgery to deal with symptoms while totally ignoring why the disease does not go away when treated. We are trained to listen to the doctor, but he has little to no training in health, just in disease. Please, read this book and pass it on.

0373774184|5.0|Loved it! A little difficult to get past the language in the beginning as Heyer uses SO much Regency slang. She does give plenty of context though so after awhile the language becomes second nature. Just like reading Shakespeare or Chaucer. Venetia's determination, self confidence and wit are typical of Heyer's heroines but Venetia is neither spoiled nor headstrong. Nor is she very young. Heyer manages to portray Venetia as even-tempered and agreeable without making her boring. She is a mature woman who manages her love life as skillfully as she manages her household. Poor Lord Damerel doesn't stand a chance.

B002ONC9NC|5.0|Based on a memoir by British journalist Lynn Barber, An Education is the story of a 16 year old girl living in 1961 London with her traditional middle-class parents.     Smart and witted Jenny, who speaks French, plays cello, and has just won a scholarship to go to Oxford envisions life on her own terms. Before she meets David, that is.     David, a 35 year old charmer, takes her to concerts and restaurants, art auctions and Paris, easily seducing her out of her dream. And when he proposes marriage, she accepts him, more than willing to forfeit her education for the glamorous life he seems to be offering her.     There is a catch though, as David is not who he pretends to be, and Jenny is, unfortunately, or maybe fortunately, forced back to redefine her life by herself.    Despite the dark undercurrent of deceit, An Education is an enchanting story about falling in love and growing up, played with charming conviction by Carey Mulligan, who received a best actress Oscar nomination for her role.  As Colin Firth, my favorite nominee in the Best Actor category this year, put it, An Education is an evocative reminder of \\"how it felt to be sixteen and believe we had all the answers, when we didn't even know the questions.\\"      I agree.
B003IODNJA|5.0|First, the negatives (niggles actually :-)):<br /><br />1: This remastered CD renders my German 1985 release (catalog # 610540 CID126) and 1990 US re-issue (catalog # 422-842 496-2) practically useless now.<br /><br />2: I'm not really a fan of Digipak CD packaging. Besides from Digipak not fitting in my CD rack, it's not as durable as a regular CD case. And since it's mostly paper-based, it's flimsy and tends to tear easily.<br /><br />Now for the positives:<br /><br />This is a treasure trove of previously unreleased (on CD) Propaganda material!<br /><br />DISC 1 contains all the tracks from the 1985 CD and 12&#34; analog long-playing album version of A Secret Wish, all remastered to perfection.<br /><br />DISC 2 contains the rarities and remixes not found in their Outside World and Wishful Thinking CDs.<br /><br />The DO WELL is particularly interesting. This is a 20-minute rare (previously available in cassette-only) &#34;mix&#34; in ONE CD track (The First Cut, Duel, Jewel [Cut Rough], Wonder, and Bejewelled). Calling it a &#34;mix&#34; is a stretch because it's not. Maybe they could have cut it down to 5-tracks since there are five separate cuts (pun intended) of &#34;Duel&#34; and &#34;Jewel&#34; here. &#34;The First Cut&#34; is a short but fitting intro to this &#34;mix&#34;. &#34;Wonder&#34; could've been a new &#34;Duel&#34; version if they had expanded on it further. &#34;Duel&#34; and &#34;Jewel (Cut Rough)&#34; is essentially the same versions of the two songs we all know and love. &#34;Bejewelled&#34; sounds like a simple cut mix between &#34;Duel&#34; and &#34;Jewel&#34; (and vice-versa). This is pure nitpicking since I love everything &#34;Jewel&#34; and &#34;Duel&#34;. This was a rarity, so might as well enjoy it!<br /><br />One last thing... Uhmm, please bear in mind that this 25th Anniversary re-release DOES NOT contain all of Propaganda's extended mixes. That is why Propaganda has other CDs...[[ASIN:B000063BKP Outside World]] and [[ASIN:B00000DFFO Wishful Thinking (Reis)]].<br /><br />If you're a Propaganda fan, it's definitely an essential purchase.<br /><br />If you're an 80's/New Wave/Synth-Pop fan, it's seriously worth taking a look.<br /><br />I'd rate it 5-stars...nuff said!ort.    I'd rate it 5-stars...nuff said!

B001XRLWPQ|5.0|Castle (Nathan Fillion), first name Rick, is a mystery writer, the kind of writer that spends most of his time plotting how to kill people. By requirement of the script, he's paired, in the pilot episode, with Kate Beckett (Stana Katic), a young, smart and beautiful female detective, and, from there, off they go to solve cases, pushing each other buttons, and creating enough electricity to warrant a second and third season.    Castle may not be the best show on TV, but it's a lot of fun, and, as a writer, I love to share vicariously the fantasy world of an author, so successful he can afford a penthouse apartment in New York City and have the major on his speed dial.    A winner.

B0032JTV6U|5.0|Glee, a musical comedy-drama television series, bubbly and sweet like a glass of champagne, follows a bunch of misfits that have joined the Glee Club, as they sing and dance and dodge the slurries the popular bullies throw at them on the halls.    But although, the musical numbers are great, what makes the show such a pleasure to watch, for me, are the characters.    We have Rachel, the super achiever raised by two gay fathers, who has accomplished more things before breakfast I get done in a week. She likes Finn, the confused basketball player who was dating Quinn, the most popular cheerleader, until she got pregnant by Puck, the Latino kid, with the Mohawk hairdo and the macho attitude.    There is also Kurt who dresses and moves as if he is in a ever present catwalk and Mercedes, the African American girl who wants to date him without realizing he is gay, Tina, the Gothic Asian American girl and wheelchair-bound, bass guitar player Artie. Two more cheerleaders sent by their coach to spy on the Club and bring it down at any costs, round up the group.    And if you think the kids are out of the box, wait to hear about the grown-ups:    William is the Spanish teacher who runs the club and just broke up with his wife, who was pretending to be pregnant, while the counselor who is totally OCD (Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder) watches him doe eyed and almost gets married to the basketball coach, who, after being stood on their wedding day now drowns his sorrows on greasy food. And best of all, Sue Sylvester, the cheerleaders coach who has a TV show so politically incorrect you don't know whether to be outraged out of your mind or cheer for her.    As Glee left us before the break, Sue everybody's favorite antagonist, had been fired. But fear not, she is back again in full swing after blackmailing the principal into her job by drugging his drink and having his picture taken, shirtless in bed.    In my favorite episode Sue decides that the best strategy to empower her cheerios is by exposing them to Madonna. The best role model there is, according to her.    As outrageous as the idea may sound at first, it made perfect sense to me after watching the show.

B001C4AFOY|5.0|The Young Victoria is an enchanting love story that ranks a close second to my all time favorite Pride and Prejudice (the 1995 BBC miniseries version with Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth).    What makes Young Victoria even more remarkable is that it is a true story.  Victoria (Emily Blunt) becomes queen at 18 upon the death of her uncle.    Although she loved her uncle, she is so elated at her newly acquired freedom that, when she is alone, she dances at the news. Her life till them has been quite gloomy. She was raised by her strict mother who didn't allow her to play with other children or do anything that could pose a risk to her life. Under pressure from her lover, her mother has repeatedly pressured her to relinquish the regency to them until her 21st birthday. Victoria's denial to do so had created an impossible tension between Mother and daughter. Now she feels she is finally free.    But Victoria, being young and not educated in the affairs of state, is expected to marry and let the ruling to her husband. Apparently, Britain in 1837, like the United States in 2008, was not ready to be ruled by a woman. Even before her ascension to the throne, she has received several proposals by suitors supported by the kings of other European countries who think that the one to marry the British queen will control Britain.    The candidate of the Belgian king, his nephew Albert (Rupert Friend), a 17 year old, amiable, educated and idealistic young man, first cousin to Victoria, came to London to make her acquaintance one year before she becomes queen.    Victoria meets him with apprehension, as he repeats what he was told to say to impress her. But when, caught in fault by the irrepressible Victoria, he stops pretending and acts as himself, their attraction for each other is palpable on the screen.    In a delightful scene, they talk over a game of chess under the watching eyes of the courtiers. Victoria complains that she feels like a pawn in a game of chess. Albert advisesher she must learn to play better than them. Victoria's 50 years reign is proof that she did.    \\"Do you also think I need a husband to rule for me?\\" she asks him at one point.    \\"Not for you. With you,\\" Albert tells her in his German accented English.    And he had me right there.    Victoria takes longer to accept him. At seventeen she feels she is too young to marry.    But marry they do eventually when they are both 21. And their love lived forever. For although Albert died of typhoid fever at age 42, Victoria who never remarried set his clothes every morning in his memory until her death forty years later.    If you are a romantic at heart and love beautiful gowns and gorgeous settings, this movie is for you.
9889979942|5.0|I first know Carter through facebook where i happened to come across some of his photos published in this book and since then i've always been a fun of his art works and his views towards art in general.     As far as i know, Carter is many things to many people: a good friend, an insightful mentor, a China expert...the list goes on. But there is no question in any of these people's minds - behind his quick smile and sparkling eyes a relentless photography mind is lurking and working.     As nowadays we've all heard from time to time that China is becoming the major focus of the world in many ways, however, we haven't seen much art work that presents the country, its people and culture in such in-depth way as Carter did in this book. the photos in themselves are in no doubt great - by this, i mean, the lighting, the color, the composition, the angles and all the rest that make photography a perfect art form to document our life. However, what makes this book unique is that how the artist managed to attach his own very personal/private emotions toward his objects through the lenses. It's the most amazing photo book so far i've seen in terms of China and its people,what's more, it's a book where we not only could enjoy as art, be installed with the knowledge of a specific culture, but also glimpse something foundamental about the artist himself and the way he interacts with the world, which is always the key factor to make an art work valuable, and also why we often feel there is something that tingles our heart in this book.     I would be unfair to say he is obsessed, but there is a certain focus on looking at the people and the society as a whole and decrepit as a way to consider what we, as humans, all have in common. I'll leave it up to you if there is any connection to the thread of desire for control that runs through the book. You can also decide if you agree with me or not that he helps us to see or remember the unintended and forgotten consequences of our choices as a society.

B002GYVRRI|4.0|Many will say that you're not a real fan of King Crimson, if you're not so crazy about the group's long and partly improvised pieces, but prefer the melodic side of the band.<br /><br />Personally I prefer the group when it stays within the relatively rigid framework which normally applies to the rhythmic music. Then you can then say that I have not understood the group's uniqueness, well, so be it.<br /><br />In any event, is widely agreed that \\"Red\\" is one of the big albums in rock history, so if I allow myself to make objections, it is obviously I who is something wrong.<br /><br />The title track \\"Red\\" is one of the tracks that I have a little trouble with. It is an instrumental with guitarist Robert Fripp in focus. That he is musical equillibrist is beyond dioscussion, and the sound of the guitar is superb. I think, however, that more than six minutes at the top.<br /><br />In contrast, \\"Fallen Angel\\" has everything I like about the group; A beautiful melodic composition by Fripp / Wetton / Palmer-James. Both vocally and instrumentally very convincing, and in this case, the playing time is perfect.<br /><br />\\"One More Red Nightmare\\" is a little harder to go to, but it is actually a very interesting compostition, both musically and lyrically.<br /><br />The long instrumental \\"Providence\\" may well be hard diet and it contains both harmony and dissonance. As a friend told me, \\"You can not play music like this, when children are nearby, it could go in their nerves\\". He may have a point.<br /><br />\\"Starless\\" is as beautiful a song as \\"Fallen Angel\\" and it may bring to mind the title track on the group's first album. Unfortunately the group here lets the number grow in some instrumentally complex directions, which some will love and others will feel destroy more than it benefits.'<br /><br />If you are unfamiliar with King Crimson, this probably won't be the best album to introduce to you. \\"In the Court of the Crimson King\\" was the album that convinced me of the band's musical importance.<br /><br />The sound on this new edition is superb, and moreover the album is expanded with three alternate versions and a DVD containing an interesting live performance from France.is superb, and moreover the album is expanded with three alternate versions and a DVD containing an interesting live performance from France.
1423101472|5.0|I have to say that The Last Olympian is my FAVORITE of them all. Riordan writes so that a person can come into the series without having read any of the previous books. (I am so glad I read the series in its entirety).  I felt like a true demigod experiencing the whole book as an outsider.  I will forever keep re-reading this book.  I am also grateful for Riordan for re-introducing me to Greek Mythology.  I forgot how much I really enjoyed about mythology and I also learned a whole lot more.  I would recommend the series as a whole to anyone, but most importantly, I would DEFINITELY recommend this book.

B003S6T62Q|3.0|Joe is an awesome vocalist and he performed well in the concert. The main problem was that he short changed us on the songs that made him so popular. He spent most of time on stage singing newer, less appealing songs. Joe only song a short medley of the songs from his best CD's (All that I am, My name is Joe and Better Days). These were the songs that I really wanted to hear. Also, when compared to R. Kelly's (Light it up)concert DVD, this seemed low budget and looked like it was filmed in a small night club. Joe is one of my favorite artists, but he needs to spend more time singing his signature songs from the previously mentioned CD's.

0061205699|5.0|I absolutely love this story. It is my all-time favorite.<br />Tom Robinson is a negro who has been falsely accused of raping a white woman in Alabama in the 1930's. Atticus is a lawyer whois appointed by the court to defend him. The story shows how Atticus' family and his friends deal with the racial hatreds and other social conflicts that result from his participation in the case.<br /><br />The beauty of the writing is that it is told through the eyes of Atticus's little daughter, Jean Louise, \\"Scout,\\" who is such an endearing and appealing child. Lee doesn't over-romanticize the wisdom of a child. Scout and her older brother Jem are completely natural characters who emerge as heroic figures.<br /><br />There are so many other memorable characters that it seems impossible that this novel could be only 323 pages long. There is Scout and Jem's annual summertime friend, Dill. There is the family maid and de facto female head of household, Calpurnia. There is the painfully naive and judgmental Miss Caroline, a recent graduate from ed school who is assigned to teach Scout's first-grade class. There is Boo Radley, the town's mysterious recluse. There is the \\"white trash\\" family that started all the trouble with their accusation of rape. Above all, there is Atticus himself, a figure of towering integrity, love, and loyalty.<br /><br />As wonderful as the book is all the way through, I must call special attention to Chapter 15, where the eight-year-old Scout, with simple love and unconscious courage, tames a gang of thugs who have assembled at the local jail to lynch Tom Robinson. This is a very moving chapter.<br /><br />It is pretty amazing that a writer who could create so many memorable characters in so few pages confined herself to this one novel as her lifetime output.
B001PJRAUS|5.0|This film is a great mix of witty British humour and Jane Austen's classic masterpiece. If you like both of those, you'll probably enjoy \\"Lost in Austen\\". It's sympathetic to the original story, and rather than mocking it (like some other Austen take-offs) I felt it paid homage to the timelessness of the themes in \\"Pride and Prejudice\\". Two hundred years later, people still have the same feelings, despite the way they might speak, dress and pass their days. It's a testament to both Austen's writing and the writers/producers of this film.<br /><br />(I won't recount the plot here, as it's been covered many times elsewhere.)<br /><br />Aside from being an entertaining twist on the original story, I found it very interesting to see how the \\"original characters\\" were portrayed in comparison to earlier versions of P&P. It's not just silly comedy - these characters are well-developed and well-acted and not what you may have been programmed to expect. Mrs. Bennet in particular was played in a very different, yet still relevant and believable light, than in the 1995 version. Jemima Rooper did a great job as Amanda, skillfully blending the comedic aspects of the role with the dramatic elements of the story line.<br /><br />I suspect a few jokes and comments here and there will be lost on non-British viewers, and I think it's a shame that a few scenes from the original series (as aired on TV in the UK)were cut.
0307454541|1.0|Well, let me say this is THE very first time I have every submitted a review of a book. So why am I doing this? Why I am I taking a few moments out of my precious lifetime to do this? Because I thought it was such a dismal, boring, sophomoric book and I can't begin to understand why the world thinks it's so great! I had to start over from the beginning of the book four times to be able to gather enough energy to finish it. I was determined to read the whole dull thing because of all the attention it has received. I wasted my time.<br /><br />My advice - skip this one.

B003BV8I68|2.0|Childhood friends who now room together and have an intense, loving bond (but not the lesbian lover relationship that's in the product details) are the focus of this derivitive J-Horror entry from Cinema Epoch. As a fan of most of their releases, something told me this one wasn't going to rate high on the production value meter, and I was right. Sometimes, it sucks to be right... It's a familiar formula with an over-used storyline akin to dozens of other Asian horror flicks, and it's a tired one with stretch marks and liver spots that's been done better many times before. Being shot on video, there's no room for post-production special effects, which bodes poorly for horror films. So there's no palpable terror, shocks or WTF moments we've come to expect from this genre. As a result, there are too many predictible scenes and a ghost spirit we're way familiar with to derive any horror from, kinda like a dreadful relative that makes holiday visits. Was it painfully bad? No. But you won't be sad to see this 'Roommate' pack their bags either...
B0000047CW|5.0|If you don't know what \\"bossa nova\\" is, or why it was so popular for so long, then this is an excellent album to get - though I believe [[ASIN:B0000047CX Getz/Gilberto]], which is my third or fourth favorite jazz album of all time, is even better. If you're only getting one (for now), then I'd steer you in that direction. However, both are very good albums both for newbies and for old jazzers (who shouldn't listen to me anyway).<br /><br />The highlight of both albums is Stan Getz's beautiful saxophone, though on this album Charlie Byrd contributes some very nice guitar work too. Let me make a confession: the first time I heard it, I wasn't really happy with Byrd's solos. Some seemed ok, some were disappointing. This happens sometimes with jazz, or for that matter probably with any interesting music. However, about the third time I listened to it, something snapped into place for me, and his solos made perfect sense. His playing has a logic that I needed a few listens to discover. Anyway, I have several albums by Stan Getz and his playing (not to mention his vocalizing, which always expresses my feelings perfectly) is something no music lover should miss.<br /><br />The reason I'd steer you to the other has nothing to do with Byrd, but with Astrud Gilberto, who sings on several of the tracks, especially \\"The Girl from Ipanema\\" and \\"Corcovado [Quiet Nights of Quiet Stars],\\" probably the two most famous bossa nova songs.<br /><br />If this tickles your fancy, let me make some more recommendations. As Amazon has realized, people often buy these with Antonio Carlos Jobim's [[ASIN:B000002G6J Wave]], which is pure musical fun. But for the people who want a little more bop in their bossa, an interesting album is [[ASIN:B00000IL25 Page One]]. Listen to \\"Blue Bossa\\" especially.<br /><br />You just can't go far wrong with any of this. However, if I've somehow left you with some doubt as to what I'd say (had anyone asked) you should hear first, let me clearly state it's Getz/Gilberto, followed by this album. My third recommendation would be a totally different direction, still Stan Getz but this time he's with vibraphonist Lionel Hampton: [[ASIN:B00000473O Hampton & Getz]], which is one of the most underappreciated jazz recordings I know of. And if you like that one, then try Wave, Page One, and Cal Tjader's [[ASIN:B0000046TJ Soul Sauce]].ilberto, followed by this album.

1452892156|3.0|After reading this, I realized I am Frankenstein's monster.  Just kidding.  The language can be hard to comprehend at times, sometimes because it is truly incoherent or stilted.  It wasn't scary. Even so, there are far passages that read so well they are like smelling a fragrant flower, the descriptions so clear and detailed yet eloquently stated.  However, it's hard to rate this book above three stars because near the end I really had a hard time following it.  It seemed the monster had died.  Frankenstein came upon a sledge and his nemesis was dead, or so it said.  Following that, the plot became nebulous and the passages were so exasperating I skipped many paragraphs until the point where Dr. Frankenstein had died, not the monster.  Then I had...the rest of the story.  But on the plus side, the plot was not predictable.  With so many pluses, and so many minuses, I rate this story three stars.<br /><br />Perhaps one day we will be able to use DNA material to recreate a Neanderthal, creating a true to life Frankenstenian monster.<br /><br />My edition was close to the original, if not the original text, the cover differing from that depicted here.

B002JVWRAO|2.0|Warning:  Spoilers ahead!      Supernatural is a very fun and entertaining show, but viewers who wanted a solid follow up to the exciting apocalyptic storyline in season four will be sadly disappointed.  Instead, prepare for sub-par character development and truly terrible pacing.      The season wasted several \\"light\\" comedy episodes in the middle of its running that offer little to no development (this viewer holds that 5x05, 5x06, 5x07, and definitely 5x09 could have been trimmed without any problems for the audience) whereas the final plot is introduced and rushed through within the final three and a half episodes.  For what is meant to be the zenith moment of a five year arc, the finale is plodding and poorly constructed, with one of the most anti-climatic resolutions to an apocalypse that can be imagined.  New characters Michael and Lucifer were decided let downs, both of whom offer little to the series aside from yet another pair of whiny schmucks with daddy issues.    Sam and Dean's characterization waver depending on the episode and which one of them is meant to learn a Very Important Lesson.  If you're a fan of Castiel, then you've my pity for he was almost painfully underused.  If you expected that Sam would grow as a character and not revert back to bad habits, prepare to be disappointed as he randomly begins to drink demon blood again in the finale (albeit this time supported by Dean, Castiel, and Bobby in an equally disappointing turn of characterization for them).  Likewise, if you had liked the idea that Dean would play any role of importance in the mytharc, please let go of those hopes now.  The pre-season spoilers about Dean being a leader and the foreshadowing about his role in the mytharc given last year have been solidly renounced.  If you like Dean being beaten up, angsty, and worried about Sam, you should be happy.  Otherwise, you may find yourself getting frustrated as the season progresses.    All complaints aside, the season does have somehighlights.  5x04's The End is a fantastic episode (albeit one that would have been improved if Sam been able to tag along) and it was a definite pleasure to see such favorites as Jo, Ellen, Anna, Uriel, Meg, Zachariah, John, and Mary again.  Sadly, in most of these cases, their appearances were one-offs.  The acting remains solid, as always.    The season could have been vastly improved by some consistency between episodes and generally better pacing.  I sincerely hope that the writers tone down the fratboy humor and return to a more subtle approach in season six.  Distancing themselves from the meta-humor would also be highly appreciated, as would a hesitation in killing off yet more female characters.  This season saw the deaths of three women - the only three women still living who had appeared in more than one episode prior to season five outside of Meg, who herself is almost criminally underused at a mere two appearances.      I may have given it three stars despite these failings had the special features on the DVDs been impressive.  Unfortunately, this isn't the case.  What's offered is a pathetic shadow of the goodies on previous season DVD releases and not enough to catch my interest.    All in all, it was a definite let down after the truly amazing season four.  Still, fans who love Sam and Dean above all else (and certainly above a plot with any sort of logical development or continuity) and who aren't as inclined to look at the little details will probably walk away satisfied.

B003LAH7MU|2.0|Sting has released lots of interesting and esoteric music.  This effort to recast some of his work in a new orchestral setting is not a satisfying experience for the listener.  Not one song on \\"Symphicities\\" improves upon the original version.  Even songs that might have worked with an orchestra (\\"We Work the Black Seam\\" and \\"You Will Be My Ain True Love\\") are pale reminders of the versions most fans likely already own.  Hopefully this moment of commercial egotism will soon pass and Sting will get back to the business of writing and performing new pop/rock songs.  Save your dollars and buy the original albums on which these songs first appeared.

1934356557|5.0|I have a vast collection of SQL books. If it was published in the last 10 or so years, I probably have a copy. Some of them are very good, but there are quite a few similar-looking SQL books, with a similar purpose and a similar look-and-feel. So it takes some doing for a new SQL book to rise above the chaff... but SQL Antipatterns by Bill Karwin manages to do so.<br /><br />This is not yet another book on SQL syntax or style. SQL Antipatterns is something altogether unique. The book is designed to point out the common things that SQL developers do, that they shouldn't be doing. Each chapter assists the reader in identifying, explaining, and correcting dangerous practices - or antipatterns.<br /><br />If you take the time to read through this thoughtful book I'm sure you'll recognize some of the antipatterns. Some of you will have done them yourself, whereas others of you probably will have worked to undo some of them.<br /><br />OK, many of you are still likely to be wondering what exactly is an antipattern is, right? Well, I'll give you one of the examples from Karwin's book -- Jaywalking. This is the first antipattern covered in the book and it is one of my favorites (err, I mean least favorites, I think). Jaywalking is when developers store comma-separated lists in a database column instead of redesigning the database structure in a normalized fashion. Karwin calls this jaywalking because both this practice and actual jaywalking on a street are acts of \\"avoiding an intersection.\\" Funny...<br /><br />Each antipatterns is described along with a clear explanation as to why it is a bad practice and advice on building a better solution. Other antipatterns covered in the book are named almost as intriguingly, such as Pseudokey Neat-Freak, Keyless Entry, Magic Beans, See No Evil, and Metadata Tribbles.<br /><br />The book is not just for unlearning what you shouldn't be doing, it can also be helpful for learning new and improved development techniques. Reading SQL Antipatterns can help you to learn about current technology for full-text search, how to design code that is resistant to SQL injection attacks, and many other techniques for success.<br /><br />The book is very well-organized into four parts grouping the antipatterns into the following categories: logical database design, physical database design, queries, and application development.<br /><br />SQL Antipatterns should become a useful tool for DBAs and database programmers to help them create well-designed databases and applications... and to help us eliminate these common errors from our database implementations.rent technology for full-text search, how to design code that is resistant to SQL injection attacks, and many other techniques for success.

B000PFUAO6|2.0|I am by no stretch a Dream Theater fan, in fact, I only appreciate them for the talent they possess.  Often I feel underwhelmed when I hear their music.  They do have many albums, and I feel it necessary to clarify that this one is not good for a couple reasons.  One, I have noticed Dream Theater die-hard fans will praise every album they have done without a critical eye.  Two, a new buyer would be better served starting somewhere else.  You may be wondering where else to start, the answer is simple, anywhere else!  This album fails in comparison to everything else I have heard by them.  You could literally blind choose any other album and be better off.  I gave it two stars because I found \\"Ministry of Lost Souls\\" and \\"In the Presence of Enemies part 1\\" to be fairly engaging.  If you still feel unconvinced go and buy \\"Images and Words\\" at the same time you pick this up and tell me that this isn't horrible.
B0000CDJPQ|5.0|This works perfectly as I expected, but the best feature is its slim design that allows me to plug in a USB cable to the adjacent port on my MacBook Pro. I tried another product (with ribbed sides) first, but it interfered with an adjacent USB cable connector. The Sonnet adapter fit without any problem.
B000002KDO|5.0|The iconic coughing intro to \\"Sweet Leaf\\" should inspire you to buy this before the music even plays.  How in the world do you even review a Black Sabbath album?  It doesn't even make sense to me to even talk about Master of Reality as if everyone doesn't already own it, and as if everyone doesn't love it.  What idiot metal-head does not own this album?  Yes, that's right, I'm going to berate anyone who doesn't have this.  It makes perfect sense to put this album on the pedestal it is on.  Even if you take away the context of when this album was recorded, when no one even pretended to be this heavy, and threw it into the current market, it is still completely relevant.  Probably due to the extent which everyone has copied this band.  We have been listening to the shadows of Zeppelin and Sabbath for 40 plus years in the metal community.
B000AAP7FI|5.0|This product is very interesting and is what I expected.  The reproduction of this old music was done very well.  I am happy with what I got.
B00065MDRW|5.0|This is one of my favorite albums of all time.  It sits proudly in my collection at the top of the CD pile.  For me, it is perfect for every mood.  I listen to it at night, during the day, with people around, or by myself in a state of introspection.  There is much going on, without the soundscape ever getting convoluted with superfluous ideas.  Whenever people tell me they like Pink Floyd, the first thing I always do is give them a copy of Meddle since so many self proclaimed Floyd fans have only heard \\"Dark Side\\" and \\"The Wall\\", but the second thing I do, and probably even more important, is I give them a copy of this album with this statement, \\"This is what Floyd would sound like if they were good, and I like Floyd.\\"  Not trying to make this review about Floyd, just simply explaining that this band for me is far more important, and way better, as evidenced by this album.
B001PB3RU8|4.0|**Update** It's been a year since I bought this CD and I just bought the deluxe version with a second disc, 11 songs, just a few of the versions from disc one. It's worth it for the songs Swimming, Addicted to Love and Hardest of Hearts.  ** I wake up with these songs already in my head! A little too English for me on a couple of songs, but overall, wow. Again, WOW. There is absolutely no one else like her our there right now. It's like the anti-Katy Perry. My favorites are the pounding, accelerating songs such as Cosmic Love, Rabbit Heart, Howl and Drumming Song. Love Dog Days. Kiss with a Fist is the song I would ban from the album for obvious reasons but just on the songwriting, the lyrics are catchy within the pace and tone of the music. Just can't support the message. It's what keeps me from giving it 5 stars. If you like Imogen Heap (but edgier) and/or Roisin Murphy, this is right up that alley.
B000002JSR|1.0|You know a band has become way too popular for it's own good when a plethora of fans will hail b-sides and leftovers not good enough for original albums a masterpiece.  I wish I could say that there are good things on here, but there isn't really anything to pick from this carcass.  Die-hard fans should buy it for obvious reasons.  If there is some poor idiot out there reading about Led Zeppelin and doesn't really know who they are, go and get your hands on album number 2, and forget about this until you are a die-hard fan after you hear their first six albums.
B000002LAC|5.0|\\"Trio\\" was released in 1987 and immediately zoomed to #1 on the country music charts where its stayed for multiple weeks. Even more impressive it hit #6 on the pop side ultimately selling a million copies (some say the CD has sold nearly 3,000,000 copies, but hasn't been certified as such), and garnered Dolly, Linda, and Emmylou with the Grammy for Best Country Album of the Year.<br /><br /> \\"Trio\\" belongs in everyone's CD collection. What your getting is three fantastic female singers for the price of one with their voices blending beautifully together. The ladies had known each other since 1975 when Linda recorded Dolly's \\"I Will Always Love You\\" and they had always wanted to record together, especially after the three performed on Dolly's short-lived syndicated series \\"Dolly\\" in 1976. However, due to conflicting schedules the Trio wouldn't get into the recording studio to do a full-length album until late 1986. The result is this; simply one of the greatest records ever released.<br /><br /> The highlight here are the two Porter Wagoner and Dolly Parton songs called \\"Making Plans\\" and the Dolly/Porter written \\"The Pain of Loving You\\" (Emmylou stated she wanted Porter to be acknowledged on this recording). Other greats include the #1 single \\"To Know Him Is To Love Him\\", \\"Hobo's Meditation\\", \\"Those Memories\\", and the Dolly-penned \\"Wildflowers\\".<br /><br /> \\"Trio\\" was followed-up with \\"Trio 2\\" in 1999, another huge seller and Grammy winning disc.

B0025UHKNS|5.0|The 405CX does everything that you would expect it to do. The heart-rate monitor easily connects with the watch and the GPS pickup is good.  The bluetooth connection to the computer sometimes requires that the USB adapter be removed and replaced in order for the computer (I use an iMac) to recognize the watch. The touch bezel is very handy when you are on the run, but if you don't lock the bezel it can be annoying when you are finished your workout. The watch battery needs to be charged between uses, but that is no big deal since the watch easily can be stored while connected to the charger. Since I started using a heart-rate monitor with my workouts I can easily gauge the intensity of my workouts. All in all, I am very pleased with this workout watch. I'm a gadget freak and the 405CX keeps me motivated to run.

This film will make you think. It is not a horror story or fantasy, but perhaps a bit of living history. Some of the scenes are extremely erotic, and the film is highlighted by a factual rendition of some Pagan traditions, as well as a wonderful cast. It really is a film experience.

9889979942|5.0|Tom Carter has done an invaluable service by letting us see the China we will not see as a tourist to China. His photos capture the peoples of each province from the point-of-view of a photographer who is more interested in the people being photographed than his own photography and photographic techniques. This observation is based on having met Tom during a recent visit to China while leading university students on an education abroad trip.     The book is the product of backpacking through China's provinces and photographing the people he met along the way. Some images are disturbing and some are funny, but all the images capture the soul of China. Even more important is that in the photos you see the China that is not sanctioned by the government or exploited by the tourism industry. Missing, but thankfully so, are those images of the Great Wall, the Forbidden City and all the other sanitized photos of the travel magazines. Included are the children, the man disfigured by an industrial accident, the people who live on the small farms, and above all the ethnic minorities that populate so much of China. We often hear about the people of Tibet, but most of the other minorities get lost and become only a blur of the larger term \\"Chinese\\" people.     This is a book of photographs, but don't overlook the excellent text that accompanies the photos. It is not just a photo book filled with pictures, but it is a personal diary that chronicles the experience that is China. Every review should have one negative, and the one thing that could have been improved is the page color and the size of type because for those of us who are getting older, our eyes do have some difficulty reading the text. The text, however, is so interesting that I could not just look at the photos and overlook the author's experience on the border with North Korea or the other adventures that went into making up Carter's Chinese adventure.    Reviews are good, but you need to get this book and experience it for yourself.
B003OF3R0S|5.0|This album this heavy as hell and its touching especially to hardcore A7X fans such as myself. Barely any mistakes during this whole album, all I heard was true genius and beauty. Every song had a different touch that made the album unpredictable. To be honest... I was kind of scared on what was going to come out of that CD. I had only heard Nightmare and Buried Alive before the album came out and my heart was pounding when I put the CD into my huge sourround sound CD player. I cranked it for the first song that I heard which was of course Nightmare and then the magical journey began...    NIGHTMARE: 9.3/10  I Love the beginning to this song, the tremondous drums start pounding after the spooking piano piece. Syn and Zacky's traditional duel guitar riffs were loved from the minute I started the song. Matt's vocals pound against your ears and make you feel like ripping your brain out of your skull. Portnoy fills in nicely because I'm already a giant Dream Theater fan. I listened to the demo of this song with The Rex's drums but to be completely honest I didn't like it that much. This is an amazing song and it's probably my fifth favorite song on the album... Yes it gets better.    WELCOME TO THE FAMILY: 8.5/10  At first I thought it was meant to be a radio friendly song but when I looked into it I saw an amazingly catchy guitar riff with a stupendous vocal performance and mind pounding guitar solo. It's the shortest song on the album but one of the truly talented displays that the band has ever put out. It's not the best of the album but it's defintley not the worst.     DANGER LINE: 7.0/10  Probably my least favorite song on teh album. A tribute to the families of war veterans and soldiers. A truly convincing song but it dosen't fit in well with this concept album. On any other A7X albumt this song would be great but here it dosen't contribute to the memory of The Rev. It's war like drum beat starts off when all of a sudden two guitars come in with a great solo. Thechorus is kind of boring to me, it has no feeling atleast not in Matt's vocals and not even in the guitar riff. It's a good song but could be better.    BURIED ALIVE: 8.8/10  As much as I'm not a fan of Metallica this has a Metallica-est sound from the early eighties. I love this song, its ten times better than anything Metallica has ever produced. The chorus is so powerful and full of pain and anger. After the second chorus the song really takes off and becomes one of the highlights on the album. Matt's voice gets so strong after the guitar solo. Convincingly one of the best songs on the album. \\"AND IT SEEMS LIKE I'VE BEEN BURIED ALIVE\\"    NATURAL BORN KILLER: 9.9/10  Practically a perfect song, the perfect mixtures of tempo's and pitch's. The speedy song with amazing guitar pieces and one of the true headbanging songs on the album. The chorus is extremly powerful and slows up a bit just to let people take in the insturmental performance they just heard. By now their minds have been blown and you are lying on your floor dying in agony over the beauty and perfection of this song. The guitar solo kicks complete ass and even a whales ass. It's so well done that I can't help but consider it my second favorite song on the album... Yes their is one song that surpasses this one.    SO FAR AWAY: 8.2/10  This song reminds me so much of Dear God off their last album which means its amazing. The one difference is that the guitar solo for this song is addicting and so beautiful that it deserves 20 Grammy's for best guitar performance. Syn's description of Rev is tear jerking and speaks to Syn's personality and his feelings for Rev as a friend and a brother. Defintley a guitar highlight of the album. If your a guitar player like myself you have to learn this song.    GOD HATES US: 10,000,000.0/10  The best f***ing on this album. The beginning is slow and compleley fools you. Then out of nowhere the song switches into maximum overdrive kicking you twenty times in the balls. I was pratically rolling around ont he floor crying like a baby hearing this godly metal song. It's fresh to hear Matt scream again even though I'm not the biggest fan of their first two albums. This is one of those moshpit songs that you hear in an epic sequence in the best movie in the world. The guitar is the highlight along side Matt's vocals. The drums are impossible and the bassline is extremly hard to follow along with. My favorite part is the guitar being played behind Matt's vocals in the beginning in the verse. Absolutley the highlight of the album and my favorite song.    VICTIM: 9.35/10  Brilliant but extremly minorly flawed. I love the female vocals in the background, it adds alot to the song. It's close to my favorite slow song on the album because the lyrics are very sincere especially in the chorus. The guitar is probably my favorite on the album even the clean stuff. This is my fourth favorite song on the album because of its time and effort that I hear throughout the song and the amazing vocal performance along with a beautiful guitar piece.    TONIGHT THE WORLD DIES: 9.5/10  Personally some of the best acoustic guitar work I've ever heard. The thing that draws me in is Matt Shadows vocals. I can't explain why but the lyrics message and the way he sings it makes me chill. Its one of those things like you don't actually have an explanation why You love a song so much. This is my third favorite song on the album.    FICTION: 8.1/10  The beginning piano gives me chills and hearing The Rev's vocals makes me practically fall on the crying. I don't know but it's like The Rev was preparing to die with this song because it seems like one of those suicide songs. Some parts of this son gs are extremly gothic and dark and make it the best track on the record but some parts make it bad. some of the vocal quality when The Rev is singing is very faint and unamusing because you want to hear him sing his heart out. This was the first and only recording of this song which makes it flawed in some circumstances. I love piano ballads and thats what keeps me listening to this song and almost crying but some epic guitar sections and better quality would of made the song epic.    SAVE ME: 8.7/10  Dream Theater defintley rubbed off on A7X for this progressive metal adventure makes it completley worth listening to this almost 11 minute song. Some parts remind me of Bullet for my Valentine which is good but the dark lyrical content makes it so enjoyable. The paower in his voice is amazing but its one of those songs that should of being overdubbed with four or five guitars but how would they play it live... exactley why they only used two or three guitars. A great ending to a magical adventure of a record.    They topped their previous albums with this, go out and buy it hell buy two for the hell of it. I assure you'll love it and have an orgasim over it.

B003PGNBO8|1.0|This is totally ridiculous!  I purchased the First Half of the season expecting that they would release a Second Half DVD as well.  I know that there is a coupon for $15 off of the Complete Season inside the first half set, but what good does that do me?  First you can't use the coupon online and I know I won't get a decent price at stores, AND, again, if I bought the Complete Series, what do I need my First Half Set for?  To throw in the trash?  You can't even give it to someone cause they won't get all the episodes.  They should have never made the First Half set if they knew there would be no equal Second Half Set.  I'm only going to buy this now if I'm able to get it used for like $10 from someone on Amazon, which I'm sure I will before too long.  Damn, at least with Avatar it was known ahead of time that a better DVD is coming before too long so I knew not to buy the first release...same with Sin City and the Lord of the Rings movies...why couldn't they do the same for this show (or actually say buying the complete series will be the only way to get the Second Half)...
0553381687|1.0|I picked up this series based on the recommendation of several folks over on reddit and I have never been more disappointed in a fantasy series. I've read an awful lot of books, Tolkien, Lewis, Howard, Lieber, Zelazny, Brooks, Eddings, Jordan, even Martin's other works where he edits the sci-fi \\"Wild Cards\\" universe.<br /><br />Nothing is as completely uncompelling as this series of books. The first book which this review is about, features NOTHING happening for the first 400 pages. Nothing. If you're looking for something other than political back-biting you're reading the wrong book.<br /><br />There is room for castle intrigue as a part of any fantasy series, sure. But to make that the prime mover? The main plot itself? Someone please stick a sword through my head.<br /><br />Put it down. Walk away. Go pick up ANY other fantasy novel and you'll be better served.
1588167461|2.0|This book contain a great deal of helpful, accurate information that can be used by any male buying, storing and caring for his clothes.  I found the history of each garment very interesting, and the tips on what to look for in terms of quality, fit, details, etc. are worth the price of the book alone.    However, for a book called a \\"handbook of style\\", I thought it was actually very limited. Overall, by following the rules from the book - and yes, the book is very rule-based - you won't go wrong at the office, at the dinner party thrown by your boss, or that polo match. The book also makes it clear you will impress women (gays need not apply or, it seems, anyone who doesn't have or aspire to have their social life revolve around a country club). If that's what your life is like then this book will meet your needs superbly.     If, however, you're looking guidance on creating a style that's a little more adventurous, look elsewhere. For example, want to know if what Prada sent down the runway might work for your style and body type? You're out of luck - the book won't give you broad principles that you can adapt to a more individual style. Especially when it comes to more casual styles, the book doesn't go beyond the world of chinos, v-neck and crew neck sweaters, jeans and other few basics.     Great book for what it is, not for what it's titled.
B0000714B5|3.0|I first saw this one in 1974. Have to say it changed a naive 24 year old's  view of life and it stayed with me for all these years.  Finally the chance to own a copy. I wasn't disappointed. Thanks.
B0036EH3XE|1.0|Despite strong performers and high production values, LOST's Final Season was a HUGE let down.<br /><br />I'll pretend it was some strange \\"flash-upside-down\\". I'd rather be left with unresolved mystery than an insulting, lame 'let's walk into the light' ending that diminishes the very parts of the program that were enthralling for 5 seasons.<br /><br />Well, they made their money I guess. Now they're crying all the way to the bank.
B00005UEAR|5.0|This album deserves its five stars for the second (self-titled) disc. For anyone who feels skittish about listening to a 40+ minute song, just get over it and jump in. As for disc 1, not bad at all. Love tracks 1 and 2. The rest is semi-lackluster (imo).  Bottom line: Amazing record
0374531269|5.0|I loved this book for so many reasons.  First of all, my knowledge of the terrible situation that has plagued Sierra Leone was very limited.  I pictured a cross of the films City of God and Blood Diamond.  I was very surprised to find this novel so irresistible.  You will finish it in less than a week.  It is very easy to read as the writer, Ishmael Beah, is very easy to understand and relate to.  He was an actual boy soldier in the government army of Sierra Leone, and nobody else could tell this story better.  This book is very sad as well as encouraging.  If somebody like Beah can make it through the stories in this novel, we must have hope for ourselves in this world.  There is no hell on earth as gruesome as what happened in Sierra Leone in the early 1990s.  Have fun reading, you will be talking and thinking about this book for long after you have read it.
B000063147|5.0|I love all of Avenged Sevenfold's albums, especially their first two. A lot of fans may not like their old material as much, but I absolutely love it. For me to enjoy the old material I have to go crazy, because it makes me crazy. If I'm just sitting down relaxing, like how one would approach Enya, this album would sound too heavy and uncontrolled. In reality, it is heavy, and the guitar is always pounding. It did take me some time to get used to. You have to let it grow on you to fully appreciate it.<br /><br />There are some really good songs on here, and even a couple ballads. If you want more, their second album \\"Waking the Fallen\\" is similar but a little more cleaner with less screaming.
0307474712|1.0|I was very excited to get this book, based on other reveiws that i had read.  i am very disappointed.  The story starts out great, but gets dark and overwhelming very fast.  It is exetremely depressing and there is never a silver lining.  I wanted the characters to do something bigger, but it never really happened.  The romance is too little too late and just not how people are in life.  Don't waste your time or money on this book!!
B003X9W98G|3.0|I really wanted to love the new doctor and in the beginning, I wasn't sure if he was a bad actor or if the writing was that bad. As I continued to watch through the season, it seems to me like Matt Smith is fine in the role, it's the writing that leaves me with a bad taste in my mouth. Karen Gillian is good as the companion but in the first few episodes, it left you wondering who was really the Doctor, Matt or Karen since she seemed to be the problem solver and he was just her sidekick. I watched the entire season, hoping with each episode it would get better. There was only one episode that I thought was wonderful this season, Vincent and the Doctor. The season finale was a big disappointment. I really hope that season 6 will get better. As much as I enjoyed seasons 1-4, plus the specials from last season, I would hate to see this wonderful show end on note like this. I miss Russel T. Davies and his creativity.
B0002IQAMW|5.0|This must have Allman Bros classic recording sound's fantastic on SCCD. I play it back on 2ch SACD and it sounds great. sound is clean and crisp and the presence is close to Vinyl.
0375842209|5.0|Rarely do I find a book that i feel is worthy of a review but this one certainly does.  I love reading and usually am reading on book on my iphone and listening to another as an audiobook.  I am half-way through this audiobook and it is absolutely fantastic. I don't think I would fully appreciate the story in written text but in the narrated form I am captivated and thirsty for more.  The narrator truely brings the story to life.  I enjoy hearing the german words and his accent grabs hold of me.  NEVER has an audiobook taken hold of me like this one.  Please don't let the book end!!!!  I would highly recommend LISTENING to this book!
0312427565|5.0|Tom Wolfe's \\"The Right Stuff\\" is a fascinating, in-depth and personal account of the test pilots who pushed the envelope between 1947 and 1963. From Chuck Yeager's historic flight in the Bell X-1, through the seven missions of Project Mercury, and concluding with Yeager's near-catastrophic flight in the NF-104, the book is an enthralling look at the early days of NASA, and of the men and women who made it happen! Of particular interest are passages that didn't make it into the terrific film adaptation, including the failed attempt of astronauts such as Jim Lovell and Pete Conrad to be among the seven; NASA's \\"shunning\\" of Scott Carpenter after what they viewed as a near-disastrous flight of Aurora 7, and how Wally Schirra's flight of Sigma 7 was seen as proof of Carpenter's messy handling of the fuel, and; the near-success of test pilots outside of NASA to successfully put a man in space before the first Mercury flights. A thrilling book for readers of history and of good storytelling, I highly recommend it!<br />Grade: A-
B002RKSZWG|4.0|For those familiar with Austen's work, Persuasion will be both familiar and somewhat different.  All of Austen's works are simple romances, but this one is another unique part of her writing.  In most of her novels, Austen had a young heroine, who is blocked from the hero by rivals.  In Persuasion, the heroine is Anne Elliot, who is 27 and cannot marry the hero, Captain Wentworth, because of a previous aborted romance.  Their history blocks them, but they still manage to overcome it.    Austen again manages to create believable characters with sharp wit.  However, while good, this book in my opinion isn't in the same great class as Pride and Prejudice, Mansfield Park or Emma.  For me its partially because of its Autumnal air and its rather tiresomely familiar at times.  Anne's father, Sir Walter Elliot's character is vanity from beginning to end.  Why Austen chose to always have a negative father caricature is a mystery to me.  The theme of the navy versus the nobility is also very prevalent.  Other lesser characters, such as the Admiral and his wife, Lady Russell, William Elliot and Mrs. Smith are truly alive.  So despite my misgivings, Austen sharpened her art enough for a book that makes a great read. It is a read that people will continue to experience for years to come.
B000002JOH|5.0|If you don't like the CD you are idiotic, dumb and don't deserve life.  Period.  This CD represents the best metal has to offer.  For you morons giving it one star go pop in your WHAM cds and then die.
1593081545|5.0|Austen's Mansfield Park is perhaps one of the most derided of Austen's books, while Pride and Prejudice, Sense and Sensibility and Emma are considered her best.  To modern readers, the heroine Fanny Price is too perfect and too inaccessible to be really sympathetic.  Earlier readers once thought Mansfield Park vied with Pride and Prejudice as her best work.  So do I.<br /><br />Austen was at the peak of her work, and while Fanny Price is not Elizabeth Bennett, she is a well written character in her own right.  While admittedly she has no 'flaw,' she does have moments of weakness, such as during the play and in Portsmouth.  But her main attribute is her resolve and accurate judgment of character.  Also intriguing is Edmund Bertram, the hero, who is the greatest clergyman in all Austen, far superior to Elton or Collins.<br /><br />Further, with Mansfield Park Austen creates some truly interesting characters.  Tom Bertram, Maria and Julia Bertram, Henry and Mary Crawford, Aunt Norris, Mr. Rushworth, the Price family and Sir Thomas and Lady Bertram.  In my opinion, Sir Thomas is the best father-figure in all Austen.  After he sees his flaw in raising his children, he at least repents and sees his error better than any other.<br /><br />The plot is magnetic and draws us into the events of these characters with an exciting payoff at the end which leaves the reader hungry for more.  Austen was adept at drawing normal characters in normal settings.  In Mansfield Park, the normal is what is really important.
B0037QGS0A|5.0|Chloe is the remake of a 2003 French drama named \\"Nathalie\\" with Fanny Ardant as Catherine the wife, extreamely beautiful Emmanuelle B&eacute;art as Nathalie the prositute, and G&eacute;rard Depardieu as the husband. This original French is very good and I recommend trying to find it. I actually saw it on cable about a month before Chloe was released and was amazed how good it was and surprised I'd never heard of it.... then a month later I went to the theatre to see Chloe because I like Amanda Seyfried.<br /><br />I was sitting there in the theatre and thinking, hey I've seen this before.... The first half of Chloe is almost the same script and scenes as the original, but then in middle of film it becomes much sexier and more Hollywood. The American version is certainly more sexy and erotic and exciting, particularly with Seyfried getting naked, but the French version with Ardant and B&eacute;art is just as good in its own right, and more dramatic in the end. ***** for both!
1423113497|5.0|If you like adventures then you will like this book. It takes place in New York, present day. The main character, Percy Jackson, is half man, half god,  but he doesn't know it. I like this story because it teaches you Greek mythology and it is full of adventures. In the beginning of the story, Percy's life starts to get weird and he keeps blowing up school equipment. Zeus thinks Percy stole his lightening bolt, and that is a problem! Grover, his best friend/secret protector saves him many a time. In the end, Percy becomes more understanding and brave. I like this story and I am sure you will too!
B002ZG99G8|3.0|The Losers, based on a comic with the same name, is about a group of mersenaries who are double-crossed by their boss and decide to pay him back for all the trouble.    The movie does push the PG-13 boundries. Lots of explosions, lots of gunfire and some corny dialog is peppered throughout this film to keep your interest up; but this film gets pretty tedious since the plot and the dialog is recycled from the A-Team.    Its worth watching once.
0307473473|5.0|This is just about one of the best books I have ever read.  I love the character development, the slow build of the story-yes that's right-SLOW-but the story of this magnitude takes a bit of time.  This is not for people that have little patience or need everything spoon fed to them.  The story is great and part of the charm is the time and care that Larsson took in familiarizing the reader to all the characters. It is like an adult version of the game CLUE but far more interesting and complex. The first 300 pages or so are setting everything up-once you get past that things really start to pick up.  This is not for kids or the faint of heart.  This is a very dark tale that will, if you truly give it a chance, you are sure to love. I was a bit sad once it was over-but happy to have two other books to look forward to in the series.
030726999X|4.0|This book is really Part III of a very long book, in which the three parts stand alone (sort of), but they really make more sense considered together. Thus, this is my take on the whole affair. Overall, I enjoyed it. The overall story is good, the characterisation is generally good and the atmosphere is nicely caught. I can quite understand those folk who criticise the slowness of the pace, but this didn't bother me. In fact, I quite liked the leisurely pace, a pleasant change from the \\"breathless\\" school of thriller writing, and much more true to life.<br /><br />The only thing I found bothersome was Lisbeth's apparent superpowers - a girl who has had little schooling, but who is a mathematical whiz, schooled in sophisticated finance, able to comprehend complex genetics texts and is almost infinitely resourceful? I guess I haven't met too many like that, so I find it somewhat incredible, but her abilities, both physical and mental, border on the superhuman, especially at the end of Book II, where even resurrection is apparently within her grasp. Now it does make for a good story, and we're all rooting for Lisbeth to come out on top, but it stops being believeable, and for me that is a big drawback. It reduces a most interesting creation to the cartoon level of Jack Bauer (who, you might remember, is actually literally tortured to death in one series, but when revived, manages to kill the baddie and escape!)<br /><br />However, in spite of that, I found the books a very entertaining and enjoyable read. And a thought-provoking one. At the heart of it is the concept of how far people are prepared to go, and the crimes they are prepared to commit, in the name of \\"national security\\". And how the apparently placid Sweden has its seamy underside, with the strong all to ready to exploit the weak. One can't help feeling that Mr. Larsson may also have had in mind countries other than Sweden...
B0036EH3X4|5.0|Lost is without a doubt, my favorite TV drama ever. Most of what people complain about, particularly \\"unexplained mysteries\\", are actually indeed answered. Lost almost never hands you an answer with one or two lines of dialog. Instead, the writers choose to show you their answers by weaving it into the tapestry of the show's narrative.    From the beginning to the end, Lost is about the characters and their relationship to each other being told in a mythical setting, and this is where people loose perspective. I knew from the start that you weren't going to find out just HOW The Island came to be, and I kind of like it that way. It's the equivalent of asking where the sun in the sky comes from. It just exists. Lost comes close at times to religious explanations of its mysteries, and this is where viewers become uncomfortable and dismissive. Many who complain about the ending forget that this dynamic of faith vs reason has always existed between Jack and Locke. Its what makes them tick as characters, and why they are so interesting to watch.    To anyone interested in getting into Lost, I suggest to start at the beginning with season 1. Its not ot say that the entirety of the show doesn't loose its way from time to time, nor does it have an absolutely perfect track record with its plot. However, it is a very rewarding experience, and if you let yourself buy into the show you won't be disappointed.
0670021652|5.0|I bought Eat Pray Love after seeing a commercial for the upcoming movie with Julia Roberts. I couldn't put the book down!  Knowing it was a true tale, coming from Ms. Gilbert's own experiences made me enjoy the book even more.  So I knew I wanted  to check out her sequel Committed.  Much different story than Eat Pray Love-but just as entertaining.  She once again shares her personal adventures this time in her quest to make sense of the institution of marriage. I think a big part of the charm for me is Ms. Gilbert's style of  writing - she makes you feel like your having a conversation with her.  Highly recommend both books!
9889979942|5.0|I forgot how I came upon Tom Carter's website but I was very intrigued by his works. I think he really show's the complexity and variety or cultures China holds. Unlike many other countries, China houses so many ethnicities and dialects. It cannot be represented by any one description, trait, or stereotype. That is why I enjoy his works, it covers so many spectrums of everyday life in China as well as the many forgotten scenes of what this ancient country holds.
B00000DCHI|4.0|Let's be realistic.  If you own \\"Piano Man\\" and \\"The Stranger\\" you have the majority of the songs on this 2-CD set.  The rest of the songs here don't measure up to the songs from those two albums that he left out.  If you don't own \\"Piano Man\\" and \\"The Stranger\\", buy them instead of this.      If you like them, buy \\"52nd Street\\" and \\"Glass Houses\\".    Forget about the rest, they're just a waste of money.  In trying to show that he wasn't a balladeer Joel turned rocker - big mistake.  He's a great balladeer - but as to being a rocker nobody is ever going to confuse him with his buddy Elton John.  But those albums that I did mention should be in any collection and my collection is 95% Classical - not even the Beatles measure up to Mozart.;)
1423113497|4.0|These are good books - I started with the movie \\"Lightening Thief\\" which I loved.  Now on the 3rd book.  I love learning about the gods & the stories capture & entertain me.  As an avid Harry Potter fan, I am disappointed by the obvious copy-cat of this author.  Things like \\"Invisibility cap(e)\\", \\"Half-Bloods\\", Parts of the villian needing to come together to make a whole, \\"Hippocampus\\" animals (think Hippogriff).  And different details like that throughout the book. Come On!  I wish that this writer, who is engaging and creative on his own accord, would come up with his own ideas.  It does a disservice to Harry Potter, and made me less respectful of him as a writer, and his work.     That being said, my kids love the stories & they are entertaining & worth reading.  Looking forward to book 4!
B001AQO3WY|5.0|I became interested in this series after reading the best-selling book of the same title. The book was outstanding and HBO's 7-part video/TV series of \\"Generation Kill\\" wasn't far behind. Like the book, the videos follow an actual group (real persons are portrayed primarily by actors...but the protagonists are real none the less) of Force Recon Marines as they enter Iraq in March 2003 as a \\"point\\" unit until they reach Baghdad and points north. Although the Iraq war would change drastically in the next few years \\"Generation Kill\\" is an excellent chronicle of the earliest phases of that war and its subsequent impact on the Marines involved. As a Vietnam combat veteran I have to say that these young Marines are a lot smarter than we were overall in terms of their ability to cut through the BS and see things as they are. And, they are every part as brave. This video series (and the book) are a must see for anyone interested in military history, on the impact of war on young hearts and minds, and the idiocy and incompetence that have accompanied troops into battle since time began. Excellent job by HBO.

9889979942|5.0|Carter's work is connected.  His photographs are evidence of not only the beauty and diversity of the differing regions of China, but also reveal the heart and soul of everyday Chinese life.  This could only have been done on foot, continually capturing the unplanned shot.  Looking through the book I can imagine not only being there to witness the sights, but also feeling the culture.  As someone who may never get a chance to visit China, I cannot recommend this book enough.  It opened my eyes.
0679804021|5.0|I teach students with special needs. Stepping Stone books give me modified classic literature that stays fairly close to the original text. This allows my students to focus more on comprehension skills, and less on \\"getting through the book\\". Treasure Island is a favorite combined with an overabundance of \\"pirating\\" activities that for a brief period of time my students get to become pirates. Comprehension soars. It is the best!
B003KUSUG8|5.0|I would have to say the first radio single doesn't do the recovery lp justice. By far the best album I've heard this year. Crazy as ever and shows his personal growth.

B003L0V758|5.0|If you pay attention to the top 40 pop songs only, this album is not for you. If you faint at the sound of any true creativity different from the stale and blasé 4 chord based rock/pop/country songs heard all over the radio, this album is not for you.    HOWEVER, if you appreciate Motown, soul, R&B, and the slightly new-age, or any genuinely good song that gets you dancing on your feet, this album IS for you. Janelle has a style that transcends generations.    When my sisters and I first heard \\"Many Moons\\" from her Metropolis: Chase Suite album, we were hooked on Janelle. I probably listened to that song over 50 times in a row before moving to the rest of the album. When we were informed that she was coming out with ArchAndroid, we waited for months and snatched it up as soon as it was available. We were not disappointed. ArchAndroid shows that Janelle is maturing and is hitting the ground running.    Her voice is superb. Not too gritty, but not too smooth to put you to sleep every second of every song. It has honeyed tones yet it holds you like a kung-fu grip at the same time. She never hits a bad note pitch-wise and her rapping in \\"Dance Or Die\\" puts most chart-topping rappers to shame.    I would have to say that this album is in the top 10 for 2010 and I'm thrilled to see where she will take us to next. GO JANELLE!

B002ZG97RE|2.0|I had a sneaking suspcicion after watching Green Zone that the reviews on Amazon.com devoted to this movie would be decidedly split since it does toss around a still volitale political football.  In this case, the lightning rod issue is the Iraq War and the infamous search for WMD's (Weapons of Mass Destruction).  Not surprisingly, the film has drawn praise and scorn for its take on the controversial issue.  Ultimately, this is the movie's downfall.  It is more concerned with pushing a political agenda than it is with delivering an enthralling, complex and well developed story.<br /><br />Matt Damon stars as Roy Miller, the chief of a U.S. military unit searching for WMD's at various sites in Iraq in 2003.  Miller quickly begins to question the intel he is relying on when site after site continues to come up empty.  Soon, he finds himself trying to get to the bottom of a coverup by the U.S. government involving a source known as \\"Magellan\\", who has been providing the faulty intel.  That's really about all there is to the plot of the movie.  Director Paul Greengrass attempts to build a tense action thriller around this thin plot, but it falls flat.  Depending on one's political leanings, I suppose the movie could be viewed as a bold and truthful indictment of the Bush administration, or a total crock of liberal garbage.  Personally, I don't think either interpretation is completely correct.  I am by no means knowledgable on all of the facts surrounding the war in Iraq (accuse me of ignorance or apathy if you will), but my guess is that the truth is far mmore complicated than either side, and especially this movie, wants to admit.<br /><br />So what we are left with, aside from a hot button political issue, is an  unengaging mess of politics and action that leaves you wanting to go back and watch the final two Bourne movies again to be reminded of what talents such as Greengrass and Damon can do when they are in peak form.

B003U21TBO|4.0|Liked this. Felt sorry for the monster: dying alone in a strange world is a frightening experience.<br /><br />The Doctor needs to take the time to tailor the talk to the audience. But he's a better physicist than a psychiatrist.<br /><br />Which leads me to another point. Amy, you could not have saved him. Trust me, and trust the Doctor, on this. (On the other hand, scholars and curators the world over are wondering who \\"Amy\\" -- in French, Aimee, Dutch, Ame -- was!)
B003RV43X4|3.0|If you can put you mind on idle, not pay attention to the butchery of the myths (did I hear right--did they say Jinn?), and accept some major plot holes, this is a pretty fun movie to watch.<br /><br />This version of Clash of the Titans is fast-paced mind-candy that sacrifices story-telling and doesn't keep faith with the audience.  After killing off one of my family's favorite characters, my children started grumbling that the movie should get one star.  The show then shamelessly tries to win back the audience by bringing characters into the finale who could not have made it there, even using the most tortured plot devices in the director's universe.  It's bad enough that you find yourself mentally popping out of the story to ask, \\"how'd they get there?\\"<br /><br />The acting is generally pretty wooden, especially for the male lead. Additionally, despite the director's attempt to make Andromeda sympathetic, I found myself not caring if she got eaten by the Kraken.  The actress needed some screaming lessons from some of the horror movie queens from the 1980's.  Perhaps Jamie Lee Curtis could find a job as a screaming coach if the yogurt thing doesn't work out for her.  Alexandra Davalos seemed to just hang there limply waiting to be eaten.  Some first class screaming and squirming might have helped, in a sick and twisted way, to develop some character sympathy.  Otherwise, one is simply left with images of Pegasus rapidly navigating around various Kraken appendages.<br /><br />Ralph Fiennes simply rocks as the bad guy, Hades. Without him and Calibos, the movie would not have worked at all.<br /><br />Did I mention that the CGI is really cool and the way in which the actors interact with it is exceptional?<br /><br />This flick is definitely a renter.

B003KATMYC|3.0|I agree with the two previous reviewers. I felt condescended to, but not insulted. This was obviously written for the 8-12 year old fans. But, unlike RTD's writing for children, it's written by someone who gets what they're interested in -- and gets them!<br /><br />Compared with the two previous episodes, it was a snore. Granted.<br /><br />I loved the Mr. Bean-esque dance Matt does in Churchill's office at the end. And I hooted at the jammy dodger \\"Corbomite Manouever.\\"  From pocket watches to water pistols, just about anything might be a weapon in ~his~ hands. The Daleks were right to be scared. :-)<br /><br />Tom Paterson is underused, again. But I suspect he'll be back. \\"Doctor Who\\" glows like a piece of Kryptonite on your CV.
B00005JMJ4|2.0|When a movie is sparse in humor, action, and storyline it is considered \\"character driven\\". Critics will always give movies like this one rave reviews. In my opinion they fear being considered unsophisticated if they call the movie what it really is; tedious, unoriginal, and boring.    The \\"comedy\\" elements tend to fall into the following categories:  1.Japanese people pronounce the \\"L\\" as \\"R\\" (Example: \\"have a nice fright\\". We've seen this bit done to death already right?)  2.Someone says something long and involved in Japanese and the translator reduces it to a sentence or sentence fragment; clearly losing much of the meaning. (also not breaking any new ground here)  3.Hollywood starlets can be so dumb and superficial.  4.The dry wit and charm of Bill Murray (Bob). Example: Charlotte (Johansson) asks Bob (Murray) where her friends are. He says they are taking dancing lessons and gestures towards them. The camera cuts to show them focused on strippers.    I enjoy the dry wit and charm of Bill Murray. He adds to every movie he is in, but this is far from his best work. There are many scenes of the two main characters discussing how bored, isolated, and unhappy they are in Japan. Then after a few tame nights out or at their hotel, Charlotte tells Bob they should never come back to Japan because it would never be as much fun. This line would have worked better if it had been delivered with a sarcastic tone. Two separate scenes of the two of them running out of a building and into the Japanese night are probably supposed to give the film a feel of excitement and energy. It doesn't play and shows a lack of imagination by the writers/director. Worse is the phony sounding phone conversation Bob has with his wife. He sounds like 15 year old as he excitedly tells her about the party he had gone to and the crazy music they were playing. I get it. His new relationship with his soul mate Charlotte has helped him recapture his youthful lust for life.     The larger theme here seems to be that seemingly dissimilar people can learn a lot from each other and form a strong bond when circumstances bring them together. Such themes have been explored in far superior movies (such as \\"The Breakfast Club\\" and \\"Beverly Hills Cop\\"). Most of those movies are probably too structured, entertaining, and geared towards young audiences for critics to heap the same praise on them though.    If this is a movie about personal growth and discovery then it invites the question; \\"in what way have the characters grown?\\" Bob had an affair on his wife of 25 years with a random woman (not his new soul-mate Charlotte, but a karaoke singer he meets in a bar). Will he realize that he and his wife have grown apart to the point that divorce is the best option, and find a young woman who still has passion for life? Would this be considered growth?    Charlotte has learned much about herself. She prefers the company of a man who is so independently wealthy that he doesn't need to work and can spend the entire day goofing off with her. Will she realize that her husband was never a good match for her and get divorced? Would this be considered growth?    I give the movie 2 stars only because Bill Murray is charismatic and likeable as always.
B003NOMHGK|4.0|I love the dorky and child-like facets of the Doctor. This is the guy who thinks werewolves are \\"beautiful.\\" This episode lets Matt play the silly child for a few shining moments, before returning to the curious, mouth-runs-ahead-of-brain adult.<br /><br />But there is serious business at hand, too. Someone's changing girls of the titular Italian city into something resembling the titular monsters, AND plotting to change the climate to favor their species. The Time Lord and his human companions must save the people by reversing the changes and preventing the invasion. (As usual, he pleads with their leader to save herself. Doc, you can't have it both ways.)<br /><br />Rory and Amy are along for the ride. There are scenes of violence. All in all, not \\"Pyramids of Mars\\" great, but not pure-camp silliness either. :)<br /><br />Loved the Questions scene between Matt and Helen. He sooo owns the role, now.
B0016Q2D5M|5.0|I first saw this on a movie channel and had to have it!  It is a good movie, full of adventure and chuckles.  The dvd has 2 sides to it, one side is for 2D viewing and the other side for 3D viewing.  The 3D glasses (2pair) came with the dvd. I can watch it in 2 and 3D which is awesome.      Brendan Fraser's character,Trevor,is a professor at a university who's brother, Max, went missing while following signals he had been monitoring. Trevor has his nephew, Sean, with him for a couple of weeks when he notices some activity on the rods he and Max had posted years ago.  Off to explore and start the adventure.  They meet Hannah, who is their mountain guide.  Off they go up the mountain, where Trevor finds one of the rods and he wants to study it but a \\"freak\\" storm chases the trio into a cave.  And that is where the adventure begins!  I love the line where Sean says, \\"We're in deep shist\\".  Gonna have to watch the movie to see how and why he says it.  I give this movie 5 stars for adventure and the laughs.  There are some cute one liners.  If you like adventure and comedy, this movie has both.

I did not see it that way (but I respect your review).  I both were kind of hung up on each other, and that at some level they knew there were the ones for each other.

0060507772|5.0|\\"The Last Hero: A Discworld Fable\\", is a basically Discworld novella by Terry Pratchett that is lavishly illustrated by Paul Kidby, coming in at around 160 pages, about half of which are in large-font text which tells the story, and the other half are illustrations, character portraits, and other fun stuff.<br /><br />Back in the 1980's, I discovered Terry Pratchett's Discworld novels not too long after he began publishing them, and I eagerly bought each new book as it was released.  My favorite leading character was Rincewind, but as time went by, Mr Pratchett centered his books around other, different leading characters and poor Rincewood faded mostly away.  Nothing wrong with that, as to a certain extent, Rincewind is pretty much a one-trick pony, and Mr Pratchett couldn't grow the Discworld universe around just one character, but I wasn't as interested in many of the newer characters.  After about 20 or so books, I kind of lost interest in the series, but I've generally kept my eye out for any stories containing Rincewind in any significant degree. So, I was pleased to recently discover \\"The Last Hero\\".<br /><br />The story focuses around the aged Cohen the Barbarian and his Silver Horde's attempt to return fire to the gods by delivering the Discworld equivalent of a nuclear bomb.  Unknown to Cohen, this act basically would destroy Discworld.  Cohen is old, and having basically beaten, robbed, or conquered everything on Discworld at one time or another, is bored and doesn't want to die of old age.  He doesn't really believe he can beat the gods, though, and just wants to go out in a blaze of glory.  However, Cohen being Cohen, he could potentially pull it off.<br /><br />Various well-known characters and factions on the planet find out about Cohen's attempt, and band together to put a team forward to attempt to deflect Cohen from his purpose.  (Rincewind, happily, is an involuntary part of the team.)  The story is well written and entertaining, and the illustrations fit well with the text.  My favorite illustration is of Verna the Ravenhaired, who basically looks like the kindly (but still deadly) grandmother she's become, but is dressed in chainmail and clutching a long, well-used sword.<br /><br />I enjoyed the book and enjoyed re-visiting Discworld again after so long of an absence.ions fit well with the text.

B00005ASOC|5.0|\\"The secret to a woman's heart is an unexpected gift at an unexpected time.\\"    This is one of my favorite movies.  I particular enjoy the dynamic between Rob and Sean's characters.  Its an observation of human behavior.  It analyzes what motivates people, how we are influenced by social pressures and expectations, and gives a perspective of how to respond to these influences.  If your in the mood for a drama that makes you think, this is one I'd recommend.  It has a Good Will Hunting feel in places although with much milder language.  There is a bit of coarse language so it may not be best for smaller children but I think its a great one for teenagers and up.
0441018866|4.0|House of Suns (2008) is a standalone SF novel.  It is set millions of years in the future in a galaxy populated by transient civilizations.  All these cultures have human origins.    The scatterling Lines are older than these civilizations.  They are long lived clones of a few powerful persons who led the expansion of humanity across the galaxy.  They extend their lifespans by time dilation and life suspension while traveling at close to lightspeed.    The Vigilance is a society of scholars living within a Dyson Swarm.  They have a different form of longevity.  The Vigilance collects data from every available source about anything and everything, but they are chiefly concerned with the Andromeda Absence.    In this story, Abigal Gentian is child of a very rich family in the Golden Hour.  Her family specializes in biological organisms, such as clones.  During a long -- thirty years or more -- childhood, she only had one friend of her own age.  She created the Gentian Line, with one thousand scatterlings.    Campion Gentian is a male clone -- a scatterlings of Abigail -- in the House of Flowers.  These clones started witn much the same memories, but live separate lives.  Once in every galactic cycle they meet in a reunion to share their experiences.    Purslane Gentian is also a scatterling of the House of Flowers.  While she and Campion are consorts, the Family generally frowns on such partnerships.     Doctor Meninx is a member of an aquatic species.  He is traveling with Campion to the Vigilance on a scholarly pursuit.    Hesperus is a Machine Person.  He is very handsome machine.    In this story, Campion and Purslane have repaired the stardam that is protecting the worlds of the Centaurs.  Campion is eager to trade for a new ship to replace the failing Dalliance, but the Centaurs are only interested in a few of his trade items.  So he decides to try another nearby ship trader.    Doctor Meninx is not happy with that decision.  He really wants to go straignt to the Vigilance.  But Campion is adamant that he must replace his ship.    Atesliga has only a few ships, of which none are suitable for Campion's purposes.  Atesliga then mentions that he has many spare parts in the largest of the ships, so the Dalliance enters the moon ship to check the inventory.  Then a force field grabs the Dalliance and holds it very firmly.    Campion tries to break out of the force field, but almost destroys his own ship instead.  Then Purslane explains to Atesliga that they are scatterlings of the Gentian Line.  Atesliga is reluctant to believe her, but she proves the relationship.    Then Purslane tells him that her ship is prepared to flee the vicinity to carry a message about their capture back to the House of Flowers.  Atesliga knows that any such message would result in prompt retaliation by the powerful Line.  He is suddenly eager to cooperate with the Gentians.    One of the spoils in Atesliga's possession is Hesperus.  Ordinarily, Atesliga would have avoided offending an emissary of the Machine People, but Hesperus was posing as an organic person at the time.  Now Atesliga is afraid to let him go for fear of retaliation.    Atesliga repairs the Dalliance, but they lose almost a year in the process.  Now Campion and Purslane will be late to the reunion.  At least they have Hesperus and other Line scatterlings as guests.    When Campion and Purslane near the Gentian reunion, they receive an emergency signal.  Embedded within it is a message.  Somebody has ambushed the reunion and killed off most of the scatterlings with Homumculus weapons.  These hellish weapons were used to melt the surface of the planet.    This tale puts Campion and Purslane in a dangerous situation.  They were told to flee, but instead decide to search for other survivors.  Purslane gives Hesperus a ship from her hoard in which to flee, but he insists on joining the Gentians in their search.    The backstory of Abigail appears in eight segments spread throughout the novel.  It starts with a visit from her childhood friend.  Abigail has a new toy -- Palatial -- which the boy appears to disdain, but she knows that he will want to play the game on his next visit.    The novella [[ASIN:1596062592 Thousandth Night]] is a prequel to this story.  This novel appears to be unrelated to the [[ASIN:0441008356 Revelation Space]] series, although similar weapons are mentioned in [[ASIN:044101173X Redemption Ark]].  Read and enjoy!    Recommended for Reynolds fans and for anyone else who enjoys tales of high technology, far reaches, and vast timespans.    -Arthur W. Jordin

0140714855|5.0|&#34;The Tempest&#34; is Shakespeare's last great play, and in an oddly appropriate way it is very different from much of his earlier efforts. Unlike most of Shakespeare's work, &#34;The Tempest&#34; seems to have come mostly from the Bard's own mind, and does not have source materials from which Shakespeare lifted the plot. This may explain the weakness of the plot of the play, regardless it does not matter in the big scheme of things.<br />The play takes the form of following three separate groups on an enchanted isle. A group of foul noblemen, who gained power through the usurpation of the rightful ruler, a comic trio who stumble about in drunkenness and plot evil deeds (the play's comic relief) and the &#34;lord&#34; of the island (Prospero) and his faithful spirit world servants. When the three plots converge in the final act of the text Shakespeare gives the reader a satisfying conclusion, but one that still has a hint of sadness and darkness to it. The famous epilogue of the play spoken by Prospero (Now my charms are all o'erthrown...) leaves the reader with a plethora of questions and emotions. This epilogue is one of the most beautiful pieces in the entire canon.<br />It has become fashionable to make &#34;The Tempest&#34; a valedictory play for Shakespeare, and there are many moments in the text that can be read as Prospero speaking for him. At the play's conclusion Prospero frees his trusty servant Ariel (some say his muse), acknowledges the half human Caliban as &#34;mine own&#34; (some say his own dark nature) and gives up his magic powers (his talent). This is an appropriate reading, and a satisfying one for lovers of Shakespeare. Just be careful not to limit the text to just that interpretation.<br />I think the greater strength in the piece is its portrayal of the absolute humanity of forgiveness, and how lucky we as humans are to be able to practice it. The most poignant scene in Shakespeare begins at the beginning of Act V when Ariel tells Prospero that he would be moved to pity for the people that Prospero has entrapped on the island (with the plan of taking revenge) &#34;were I human&#34;. This stunning declaration causes Prospero to recant his vengeful purposes, &#34;the rarer action is in virtue than in vengeance.&#34; A grown up Shakespeare has lived a life and seen the capacity for good that humanity can engender. It is hard to imagine the man who wrote &#34;The Tempest&#34; as the same man who wrote the revenge blood fest &#34;Titus Andronicus&#34; so many years earlier. A mature work, from a mature playwright!<br />As for the Pelican Shakespeare series, they are my favorite editions as the scholarly research is usually top notch and the editions themselves look good as an aesthetic unit. It looks and feel like a play and this compliments the text's contents admirably. The Pelican series was recently reedited and has the latest scholarship on Shakespeare and his time period.

097747609X|1.0|I purchased \\"Mein Kampf Official Nazi Translation\\" because I was curious about recent news of the uptick in its popularity in India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and the middle east.  I wondered what there might be in a 70 year old book that could draw so many eyes ... especially a book by such an infamous author.<br /><br />To be honest, I'm still wondering.  Although I haven't finished the book, and cannot pass final judgment, so far it's been bit of a snooze-fest.  Not only is it a poorly written mess, but it fails to present a focused thought.  Instead, it rambles on and on, and seems more of a rant than anything else.  Too bad there weren't blogs back then, perhaps he could have worked out his thoughts a little better before vomiting them out in what appears to be a singularly boring read.<br /><br />What keeps me reading (and it isn't easy) is a sincere interest in the thoughts of one of the most notorious men of the last century.  If this book is becoming a best seller in certain parts of the world, we should be paying attention.<br /><br />I suppose I'll have to finish it and then re-read it to start picking out the gems (if they exist), but maybe not ... there are so many well written books.  I can't decide which is the bigger waste, the money I spent to buy it or the time sunk in reading it.

B003JSSPSY|5.0|By comparison, the first season had it's shaky parts but was gorgeous as a whole...stunning characters, perfect scenery, just solid fantasy storytelling that's hard to come by on TV these days. I didn't expect to ever truly love it. But the moment you see Tabrett Bethell reprise her role as the wickedly beautiful, seemingly heartless (and bi) Mord'Sith Cara doing her Mistress thing in the first episode of Season 2 and thankfully joining every episode thereafter, everything changes. She was easily the best thing to ever happen. The show reaches its potential almost all at once, drawing upon much darker and interesting themes...downright deliciously twisted at times. Sometimes Xena-like, sometimes like nothing I have ever seen nor will ever see again. The fights were boss, emotions were everywhere, and both the good and dark magic never made anything easier. The Cara/Kahlan dynamic is completely surprising and oh so addicting. I loved every step of this journey. Must-see!

0393312836|3.0|When it comes to so-called classic literature, sometimes it's difficult to differentiate the truly ingenious material from the weirdly pretentious. In the case of Clockwork Orange, I think Anthony Burgess is dancing very merrily along the thin line that separates the two.<br /><br />I won't pad my review by rehashing the plot as so many others have already, but I do want to address a couple things. First, there's the frequent use of certain Russian slang/gibberish which the reader is assaulted with from the very first page. To some it may seem contrived and jarring, but if you plod through it long enough it becomes second nature with the help of context clues and it really does give the main character of Alex a distinct voice as Your Humble Narrator. I can be very impatient, so if I can get through it, anyone else should be able to. However, I don't feel there was much else to go on in terms of why I should care about or feel for Alex, and this is where I feel as if having seen the movie first works as an advantage. Clockwork Orange strikes me as a very visual story, and the Stanley Kubrick film adaptation really went over the top with its disturbing sexual imagery and bizarre costumes and set pieces. Love it or hate it, it sticks in your mind. In the novel, which I realize came first of course, Alex comes off an \\"everyman\\" and is quite forgettable once you close the cover, and is overall quite tame in terms of sex and violence.<br /><br />Thematically speaking I also felt the film version had the bigger impact. Maybe the whole idea of good and bad and the choices each one presents is better illustrated visually than on paper, I don't know, but perhaps Burgess tried to be a little too deep and profound which caused the whole thing to build up only to fall flat at the end, whereas the film presented it in a wink-wink, nudge-nudge kind of way all along. I will give props to the book for presenting a number of memorable and thought provoking quotes on the subject though, which I have since passed on to my friends for discussion.<br /><br />In itself, Clockwork Orange was not a bad read. It's a unique and imaginative social commentary and I can certainly see why it's heralded as a classic. But because of its inflated reputation and the fact I had the film so ingrained into my brain going into it, I suppose I couldn't help but be slightly underwhelmed. Still, I'm reluctant to come right out and say the movie is better at the risk of sounding like I don't \\"get it\\" because I most certainly do. I just happen to think the visuals of the movie enhance the characters and theme. In fact I'd probably recommend checking out both in order to get the fullest understanding of what's going on, because one helps to fill in the gaps of the other.since passed on to my friends for discussion.

B00003CXB4|1.0|As has been said before, this is an obvious knock-off of the original DVD. The printing on the case/DVDs is poor quality. This movie would not play in my Sony Blu-Ray player, nor would it play on the DVD player in our bedroom without hanging. Luckily, it does play in my daughter's DVD player, so I kept it (as this was intended for her anyhow).      Buyer beware.
1597801585|5.0|And I agree with the blurb on the front cover: It's ridiculous how good this book is. The world-building here is stark, intricately detailed, clever, imaginative, and capable of filling me with the same primal terror of an apocalyptic future as when I read Cormac MacCarthy's \\"The Road\\". There are no apologies in this novel and nothing swept under the rug, especially the ugly things that civilized people don't talk about: the things we all know are happening all over the world on the less alluring canvas of reality. At times, this novel is hard to read, and you feel outrage for creatures as abused as some of Bacigalupi's characters are. This is not a world that any sane person would want to live in, and at the same time you yearn towards it, towards the fantastical and the (currently) impossible, because we are smart monkeys and we adore shiny, deadly new things. This novel is a keeper. I can't recommend it highly enough.
B003ITZBW2|5.0|From the no holds barred opening scene dissolving to the classy cinematic credits and film score, this was the biggest surprise and the best of all the direct to dvd Warners/DC animated movies to date and packs a major wallop right to the final breathtakingly animated, heart wrenching scenes. Reminiscent of the dark themes, intensity and emotion of the uncensored version of Batman Beyond - Return of the Joker, no coincidence that the unrelentlessly evil and twisted psychopath Joker does very bad things to another Robin in this one too.   As they say, you are only as good as your script and this movie gets the balance just right between emotionally charged character motivation to give reason for all the vigilante anger and violence, so the explosive, action packed set pieces doesn't just become 'noise'. We actually give a damn about the characters. For an animated film as opposed to live action, this is more difficult to achieve but that's how good 'Batman: Under The Red Hood' is.  Voice acting all round (perfectly cast by Andrea Romano) is pitch perfect with perhaps the exception of Neil Patrick Harris as 'Nightwing' whose tone is more lightweight/cartoonish but then again, his character in this movie is the least angry out of all the characters.   What Christopher Nolan's 'The Dark Knight' did for raising the bar of live action superhero movies to the next level (how dark and adult can they go?), this movie raises the bar in quality of superhero animated movies. This movie is not suitable for children but made for a wider, more adult audience. Producer Bruce Timm and his team must be relishing the creative freedom that this direct to dvd format gives them (easing censorship restrictions that Television can impose), to be able to have such dark themes in animation get to the final cut.   If 'Superman/Batman: Apocalypse', released 28th September can match the quality and intensity of this one, then Warners Animation will continue to set the benchmark standard that other animation studios will try to emulate.
B003PGNBO8|5.0|Flashforward was one of the best new shows I've seen since Lost first hit the air. It had so many elements needed to make a great show: good writing, amazing actors, suspense and mystery all with a unique show idea. Unfortunately networks just don't seem to have the patience needed anymore to give a new show time to find it's footing. This on top of pulling it for a midseason break just as it was building momentum killed it. Hopefully another network will have dedication and give it the chance it needs to actualize it's potential.
B003VB5E2E|4.0|I was at the concert and saw the 2 hr movie release. So little BB King was actually a blessing he did very little playing at the concert and mostly talked. The young dude with Buddy Guy and Ron Wood was Jonny Lang he has been around since he was a 15 or 16 year old kid. Very talented. I think the DVD will be more enjoyable I own the first 2 and they were excellent!
B002RHGYOA|3.0|Salander is a complex character. Kind, evil, generous, selfish, capable, vulnerable - she is full of contrasts and likeable. With a strong storyline, and a suspenseful thriller, it's not surprising that this is a bestseller. It's original, and the kind of novel which creates a cult following.<br /><br />Issues<br /><br />Others have reviewed that the novel lacks editing, and I strongly agree. There is much included in the novel that really doesn't add to the story or character development, and therefore shouldn't be in there. It detracts from the pace of the novel, bogs you down with detail, and distracts from the story. It could benefit from some severe editing.
B002ZG97RE|2.0|Eh...It was an ok film, modern day Iraq w/ an army unit looking for WMDs, this film is also political. Damon did a good job acting. Interesting in that sometimes what the military wants and what the govt wants can be completely different things and the two sides can clash, and the resulting media spin to the public for what they want us to believe is happening. A few good chase scenes but that's about it. An ok rental, I wouldn't buy it though. I had to deduct a star due to the horrible shaky camera effect through this film, I get what they are trying to do- to make it seem more realistic, for me though it just doesnt make it enjoyable to watch.
B003OF3R0S|1.0|Terrible, redundant.  It's like a bad movie where every move the main character makes is predictable and boring. I knew every chord and riff that was coming before they even played it.    Fast forward ten years and people will say....     Avenged who?
B0000X61UU|4.0|I have extensively used Cindy Crawford's other two workout videos with happy results. This is the hardest video by far. I would say the leg portion is fun, but can be challenging if your joints or knees are vulnerable in any way. I am within the healthy weight range, but felt a lot of pressure on my bones and joints during the jumping portions. Those karate kicks are very fun, though! So, I just skipped the legs portion one time, doing my own version of legs following the rest of the tape, and it was fine.    The arm moves are really good. And I've researched a lot of arm moves. I use light weights, lighter than the ones she uses. This way I can do the movemements properly and without over fatigue. I have to say, these exercises are unique and really do use the muscles at different angles I hadn't seen previously.     The abs are good. Nothing special or as great next to the arms, but effective.     The one drawback would be the length of this video. It's longer than most, so you can't get your workout in quickly. You could, of course, break it up, but I like to get everthing done in that day's workout if I can.    Hard workout - I really respect Cindy Crawford for being able to do it all those years ago. It's not easy.
B003VB5D84|5.0|I love when people rate a DVD that they haven't seen because it hasn't been released it yet.  I especially like it when they are actually just getting some anger out and venting to the unwitting amazonian world.  And I love it when they sound pretentious about guitar playing and don't seem to like or appreciate the blues (which Clapton and many of his invitees seem to love).  But best of all about this person's emotional outburst: they watched only 30 minutes of a 2 hour theatrical release (which I would give 3.5 stars because the second half was very good), which is only 1/8 of the four-hour (as yet unreleased) DVD/Blu-ray of the film.  I love people that do this SO much that I decided I had to get into the action--at the very least to offset the maroon (as Bugs Bunny would say) that fits the aforementioned descriptions.    A lot of people seemed to think the film was pretty good--so I'm interested to see the other 87.5% of the performances when the DVD actually comes out.
1594202559|4.0|I've been in the Hedge Fund Industry since 2002 and have worked on both sides (HF and FoF), and this is a terrific read.  It has about 15 distinct stories and each story is ~20-35 pages.  Mallaby does a good job of both giving background on the trader/investor and the particular \\"bet\\" or series of investments that made/broke the managers.  There are a few points that stick out: 1) Some of the insider stories from the late 90s and mid 2000s that are funny, sad, pathetic, and amazing aren't told 2) The emphasis of this book is primarily Macro traders (Commodities Corp, Moore, Tudor, Quantum) though there are some stories of fundamental and EV driven (Steinhardt, Tiger, Farallon) 3) Due to #2, this is definately not an all encompassing HF story book.  Most good Convert Arb shop stories have not been told (very popular in mid 90s and 2000s, then had the bad 2005) nor the stories of many Tiger cubs or even the large launches of ELS and Event Driven shops from prop desks .  All in all, this is a good read and a fun read (you should get through it quickly, or at least not put down the book mid-chapter) and has some more detailed descriptions of trades.  It made me want to raise some money now and look for market discrepancies.  Happy Readings.

B000002I77|5.0|One of the great things about being a fan of Deep Purple is exploring all of the music each member was involved with. Sure I love the heavy stuff but its great to be able to listen to a genuine wide spectrum of music.   I'm glad I didn't listen to this album when I was a callous youth. I probably would have had real trouble with it. As a matter of fact, I made a conscious decision back then (mid eighties) not to listen to \\"Concerto for group and Orchestra\\". I knew I wasn't equipped to handle it and now its one of my favourites (actually the new version with Steve Morse is my favourite).   Spectrum would have been totally over my head but as I write this I am totally grooving to this extraordinary album. It's fantastic.   I look forward to enjoying this for many years to come and to exploring more from these fantastic artists.
068485743X|4.0|This is a great book for any one wanting to get published.  Lukeman gives insights into the publishing world and lets you know why editors and agents reject your novel at a glance.  He lets you know the common pitfalls that new writers stumble into and how to avoid them.  Each chapter ends with exercises on how to improve your skills.  I actually tried the first few exercises before giving up and finishing the book.<br /><br />I highly recommend this to all writers published or not. Actually most published authors could benefit form this book to tighten up their prose.<br /><br />Next to \\"The Elements of Style\\", \\"The First Five Pages\\" should be on every writers bookshelf.<br /><br />APD

0060558121|5.0|Just finished \\"American Gods\\" by Neil Gaiman. Great read.<br /><br />And maybe it's a little ironic (or fitting?) that now I'm posting about it in a space built for the \\"new gods of credit card and freeway, of Internet and telephone, of radio and hospital and television, gods of plastic and of beeper and of neon.\\"<br /><br />It's a space that doesn't *really* exist--by it's nature, it's virtual, yet it's one that millions of people give their time to every day. It exists, has a purpose, (a life?), precisely because we give it those things.<br /><br />That is the essence of \\"American Gods.\\" It's a story about a man named Shadow and his part in the old gods' struggle to stay relevant in a world of changing ideas. It's a story that stays with you. Highly recommend.

0691142165|5.0|Reinhart and Rogoff have done an excellent job at organizing and analyzing so much data for the past two centuries. A more clear picture is presented of how a financial crisis can potentially develop and what policymakers need to understand and do to see a crisis coming while responding appropriately. I'd agree the book can be pretty dry and academic however for any student in economics, finance and political economy, this is a must read. Certainly, a lot of the data is dependent on what others have found especially for data before World War II but it is difficult enough to accumulate and find exact numbers for two centuries.     A good book that deserves to become part of collegiate curriculums.

0805079831|4.0|Naomi Klein deserves praise for performing extensive field work in making her case of disaster capitalism. As a student of economics and political science, this book touches on a perspective that is not commonly taken when it comes to modern day issues. From my time reading, I find she has done an excellent job in investigative journalism from hunting down victims of CIA experiments to survivors of war torn countries. However, she does spend a great deal of time being very angry and antagonistic towards pure-free market capitalism and much of the recent administrations most notably Republican administrations. Her bias is clear but her point cannot be ignored with all the cases she has provided. I don't exactly agree with everything she writes and much of those nuances have already been laid out by other reviewers but she makes a good point overall. I doubt she misunderstood Friedman's free market capitalism or have not read works by Friedman and von Hayek. She makes it clear from the beginning that it is the fervor and zealousness in pursuit of free market capitalism that has lead to excessive hollowing of a government's core responsibilities. In this journey, capital is being stripped from the government and siphoned by private enterprises while taxpayers are getting the short-end of the stick as public services go downhill with private services profiting. Policymakers are not immune from being a cause for this problem. It is disturbing to think a country's capacity and wealth is being hollowed out as only a glass shell remains to defend the shrinking middle class and poor.
0743455967|5.0|King at his best. He always good for a laugh and a cringe, whether he's remembering his babysitter or ear infections; you just can't put this book down. Those memories alone make this a great book, but the details of his near-fatal accident that occurred while he was writing this book make it amazing. For anyone that aspires to write, this is critical insight into what it takes. And if you couldn't care less about writing, well then skip the writing stuff and read the rest. You won't regret it.
B001FB4W16|5.0|I was skeptical of True Blood, to be honest.  I am not a vampire fan, and the genre has become a bit stale to me.  True Blood pretty much took that opinion and threw it out the window.  The show is a must watch for anyone who just wants to see some good television.  It can be a bit over-sexualized at times, but it does little to detract from the overall plot line.  I would (and have) recommended this show to anyone who wants to watch something fun.

0307594777|2.0|I bought these books due to my boss talking about how much she liked the first book and her discussions about it with our executive director that had also read them.  I read the first book, but have to admit I gave it up after reading a little over 100 pages of the second book.  I found that he didn't make his main characters Mikael and Lisbeth likeable enough for me to really care what happened to them.  He had so many characters that it was hard to keep track of them.  He didn't have his main characters fleshed out enough and the secondary characters were even less so.  I can't say that I would recommend these books to anyone.  I'd tell them to wait for the movie and maybe the actors will add something to the characters that the books didn't.
B003RV43X4|3.0|My son and I enjoyed the movie.  Sure, it didn't follow the mythology to a tee, but we took it for what it was...entertainment.  My son has read all of the Percy Jackson books, and he noticed the disparity in legend.  But he enjoyed the action, and didn't really care that the costumes didn't measure up.  Go figure.  It's worth watching, especially with a kid.  As an adult, you may find your interest waning, but as long as your child finds pleasure in it what more can you ask for?

0143118420|2.0|I wanted to read this book partly because I was interested in it as a phenomenon. I don't have a problem with the subject matter or the reasons why (or means for) Gilbert embarking on and writing about this trip. Good quests about the search for self are important, no matter their original impetus. Did she suffer the greatest heartache one might suffer to send her on this quest? No. But she did have the encourage to recognize her pain and then to thoroughly dissect it.<br /><br />My problem, and the reason why I am finding it very difficult to make it all the way through this book, is the writing. I cringe at every \\"I'm so cute\\" or \\"let's make it rhyme so it's catchier!\\" So much of the prose is cloying and self-indulgent, the kind of tripe that would never be published without an established name, no matter how small, and a publisher's reputation (and dollars) at stake. Yes, Gilbert has some interesting insights, but those seem to be limited to two-three pages per section.<br /><br />Of course none of this matters now that it is a Juggernaut with Julia Roberts attached to it. But if Gilbert wants to write another follow-up that this time might succeed, I'd suggest a brief \\"21 Things I Learned While Traveling.\\" The only problem is that it might be difficult to find 21 truly insightful, interesting ideas to flesh out such a manual.<br /><br />I wanted to like this, if only in solidarity to so many women who have read it. I understand she was not out to conquer the literary world. But how very, very sad that this is heralded as a book for the thinking woman when it reads like the very dregs of every romance novel.<br /><br />Take a good writing workshop, Ms. Gilbert. Get a better editor. And best of luck on new \\"literary\\" adventures.
B002ZB26AO|5.0|If anyone ever tries to tell you that politics doesn't matter, I suggest you raise the case of North Korea. Now, I don't mean the big abstracts like \\"Communism\\" and \\"dictatorship\\" and \\"rogue state.\\" I'm referring to the little things, the day-to-day realities experienced by individual people who are caught up in the unique political environment called \\"North Korea.\\" Here are a few glimpses snatched from Barbara Demick's brilliant study of the subject:<br /><br />  * The elementary schoolteacher whose class shrank from 50 to 15 in the depth of the famine in 1997-1999 because the children had first lost the energy to walk to school -- and then simply died.<br />  * The doctor who was instructed by her superior at a hospital not to squander scarce penicillin on a man dying of a bacterial infection because he was a \\"class criminal.\\"<br />  * The five-foot-tall man who was accepted into the North Korean Army because its height requirement had been lowered in the early 1990s due to the stunting of the younger generation.<br />  * The young couple, desperately in love for more than a decade, who both had plans to defect to South Korea but were so schooled in distrust that neither could confide in the other -- with the result that they met again only years later in the South.<br /><br />Nothing to Envy -- the title is taken from a North Korean children's song extolling the virtues of the Fatherland -- is based on Barbara Demick's work as a reporter over eight years for the Los Angeles Times. Demick made nine trips to North Korea from 2001 to 2008 and interviewed approximately 100 North Korean defectors, most of them now living in South Korea or China. Nothing to Envy revolves around the stories of six individuals from the northeastern city of Chongjin, formerly a heavy industrial center where all the factories and all the businesses closed in succession as the country's economic crisis steadily deepened over the years.<br /><br />The stories told in Nothing to Envy cast a bright light on the tragedy of North Korea.

So far the toy seems very durable (a major perk since my toddler son seems to be bent on destroying everything in his path these days!).<br /><br />The only thing I am disappointed with is that the balls can suck in water, therefore holding water and eventually molding, which will be hard to deep clean but I have a process for those kinds of toys already.<br /><br />Other than that, its not a dangerous toy, its easy to clean and clean up, and the most important reason of all: it provides plenty of bath time fun for my son!
B000EXDS5M|3.0|This is a mostly entertaining look at a couple of bank-robbing buddies and the female teacher they both love. The cast members and locations are good and the story is interesting enough.  I just didn't care for the goofy soundtrack which is somewhat anachronistic, and I am not sure what happened to Etta at the end.  Also, the lengthy montage in the middle that is supposed to tell us of the trio's journey across the country and then to Bolivia seems out of place and odd.

0385532458|5.0|I have to confess I've never read anything by John Grisham before.  I've seen a couple of movies based on his books and liked them but never thought I'd enjoy reading his work as I thought they'd be too steeped in the world of lawyers.  This collection of short stories has completely changed my mind as they are delightful.  They extend a wonderful tradition in which Guy de Maupassant, Edgar Allen Poe and Roald Dahl feature prominently.    These are not heavy lawyer stories although lawyers or, at least, brushes with the law feature at least incidentally in every episode.  I suppose you could imagine this book being inspired by the scuttlebutt that gets traded around a small town lawyer's office.    The collection starts with the pathos and hilarity of Aggie's well-intentioned odyssey to visit a friend in hospital in Mamphis in \\"Blood Money\\".  The book ends poignantly with \\"Funny Boy\\" and tells of the return of a son of Ford County from his own different kind of odyssey. (Expect no spoilers from me).  Funny Boy is probably the story that shows Ford County's secrets at its worst but with a few jewels hidden amid the murk.

0143118420|4.0|I think Eat, Pray, Love is so popular because it plugs into the current zeitgeist for so many women, by telling a new kind of story.  Rather than use the familiar romantic narrative (woman is subject to a grand sweep of events beyond her control, but through her qualities of patience, acceptance, loveability, she makes connections and fulfills her destiny, which is to suffer nobly), Eat, Pray, Love creates a story that is more real to actual modern women.      Gilbert stubbornly refuses to be swept away by anyone, she wants to make her own life on her own terms. When she suffers, she makes a big huge stink out of it and then goes out to try to do something about it.  She doesn't romanticize her behaviour or omit to tell how much self-doubt she has to overcome.  Rather than paint herself as heroic, she shows all her pathetic, crazy ups-and-downs.  Women respond to this because that's what their own lives feel like.  It's a breathe of fresh air, like when biographers stopped painting their subjects as saintly and started discussing their failings.    Of course to do this, Gilbert has to try to include a lot of humour and charm.  She also very cleverly chose the narrative of an actual journey to relate a story that is really about her inner journey:  to learn to savour the pleasures of life, to develop spiritually and to find a way to live that is balanced between the two.    The result is far from perfect, there will no doubt be much better books in the future on this same theme, but hers is one of the first that feels real and therefore has struck such a chord with women.  I think many people who dislike the book so intensely prefer their heroines to suffer nobly, not get up off the floor and say 'to hell with this, I'm outta here.'

0743297334|1.0|After reading the first couple of chapters of boring conversations I was still waiting for something interesting to develop. But there was nothing, so I started skipping pages, finally skipping to the end. This book is rated as one of the finest novels ever, but I don't see that at all. It is a total bore.
B003L20ICE|4.0|O.K.--let me first say this--i'm no prude by any means-- but was all the sex really that necessary? It was to the point of being gratuitous. I mean, we are all sexual beings, but this film went a tad overboard with the heterosexual as well as the homosexual sexual escapades.    Other than that, I really liked this movie. The acting was superb by everyone. Jullianne Moore has always been a favorite of mine--why she hasn't snagged as Oscar yet is beyond me. Her performance is matched by Annette Bening. I'm convinced, come awards season, nominations will be kind to them both. And what can you say about Mark Ruffalo???--he is just beyond sexy in this film.      I just wish the film had a little less sex and a little more Moore/Bening dramatic interaction.
0060853972|5.0|Azaraphale (an angel) and Crowley (a demon) have known each other since Eden. (Crowley was actually responsible for that whole apple business. Like many of the underworld's senior figures, he'd been an angel once. He hadn't actually intended to fall...he'd just hung around with the wrong people). The pair have been on Earth ever since, officially doing their Masters' work...and have been enemies for so long, they've become good friends. (They don't interfere too much with each other's activities, and even - occasionally - help each other out. It means they both get to look good in front of their bosses).     Crowley has been responsible for quite a bit of badness over the years - the M25 and VAT, for example. (He also received a commendation fror the Spanish Inquisition, even though humans came up with that one by themselves. Naturally, he just took thecredit and said nothing). Unfortunately, Satan has decided it's now time for Armageddon and has decided Crowley should supervise proceedings. (He isn't too happy with this \\"honour\\". This is the Final Battle, after which there's no more world - just endless Heaven or Hell, depending on who wins. Crowley's grown quite fond of the world over the years, and he'd rather stay where he is). His first task is to deliver the Spawn of Satan to its human parents. Crowley arrives at the hospital just as Mrs Harriet Dowling - the wife of the American Cultural Attaché - has given birth. (Her husband's in on the switch, as are the nuns who run the hospital - the Chattering Order of Saint Beryl is, after all, an order of Satanic Nuns). Unfortunately, thanks to a mistake in the switching, the Lord of Darkness goes home to Tadfield with Mr and Mrs Young, who christen - if that's the right term - their new \\"boy\\" Adam. Meanwhile the American Cultural Attaché's new son - named Warlock - is fully human.     Following the switch, Crowley pays a social call to Aziraphale, who - like Crowley - has grown very fond of the world as it is. (Aziraphale runs a bookshop, but he does everything he can to stop people from buying anything. The shop is really just somewhere to store his book collection). The pair agree to become personally involved in Satan Junior's life, hoping their shared influence will bring about a stalemate - and preventing the war from starting. Aziraphale and Crowley, however, keep a careful eye on the wrong child and only realise the mistake - and how much trouble they're in - at Warlock's 11th birthday party.     Luckily, the pair will be getting a little bit of help. Anathema Device is an attractive young witch, who has just moved into Jasmine Cottage in Tadfield. She's a descendent of Agnes Nutter, the only truly accurate prophet who ever lived - and Anathem owns the only printed copy of Anges' very specific prophecies. Worryingly, they end - abruptly - shortly after Adam Young's eleventh birthday...though at least the prophecies have at least given her a heads up. There's also Newton Pulsifier. As a Witchfinder Private, it's his job to hunt out strange happenings...and he's noticed a bit of strangeness about Tadfield. (Newton and his superior, Shadwell, are the last two Witchfinders in England). An ancestor of Newton had, coincidentally, put Agnes Nutter to death - and now Newton and Anathema are fighting on the same side. However, they're really up against it - the Four Horsepersons of the Apocalypse are in the process of putting the band back together. (The group now consists of Death Famine, War and Pollution - Pestilence retired in 1936, after a nasty bout of Penicillen).    Inneffably good and totally recommended.
6304712936|5.0|This was a movie which was so entertaining from start to finish. It was funny and the music is so entertaining. If you love the music from Mozart, this will be the movie to watch!
B000MGB6M8|4.0|I think this is a great movie.  Just FYI, the Blu-ray only contains the theatrical release and not the uncut/unrated version that all these other reviews are describing.  I kind of think it's ridiculous that both versions were not included in this Blu-ray.
B001RIY4WE|5.0|This blu-ray is a good buy to show off your home entertainment system. The picture and audio quality are first rate. If you don't already own this movie, I would recommend to add it to your collection.
B003ES5JDS|5.0|WOW...I've never written a review for anything I bought, but DANG!!! This movie was AMAZING!!! I went in with an open mind and walked away IN AWE!!! This movie is GREAT the animation is SUPERB. The Voice casting (which I thought would never live up to the animated series) truly surprised me. The characters were right on...I like the Joker in this version, seems a lot more DARK,TWISTED, AND INSANE. If you like the DC Animation I HIGHLY encourage you to get this. PARENTS BEWARE THIS IS DEFINITELY NOT FOR YOUNG VIEWERS. Just in the first 30 seconds of opening you see some pretty brutal stuff. The extras were ok not a lot but ok I guess. The JONAH HEX SHORT THOUGH...This is another reason why this movie should be a must buy. Hopefully DC will come out with Hex's own animated movie.
1401203078|5.0|The Black Dossier is widely entertaining, and I think the format of the book is marvelous.  The Black Dossier is the history of the League, and the variety used in depicting it's history is terrific.  Peaple may not like the fact that there isn't a true end or may not be a complete story, but the gem is the Black Dossier itself.  I enjoyed this book thouroughly and since 1910 has come out, I can't help but wonder how many other stories from the Black Dossier might be done.
1439148953|4.0|Brooklyn casts it's spell quietly. A small story rich with human drama, for me it captured perfectly the feeling of migrating to a new land and the sense of loss and opportunity brought in equal measure.    Toibin is a master of controlled, evocative writing, he absorbs his characters with a journal like relevance, exploring inner thoughts that take you on a heartbreaking but entrancing journey. His brevity of prose pitches his characters perfectly and reminds us that a good story doesn't need to be overworked.    Highly recommended!
B003ITZBW2|2.0|Batman: Under The Hood, written by Judd Winick, reincarnates former Robin, Jason Todd, as a homicidal vigilante. Though the permise was gimmicky from it's conception, (an obvious ploy commisioned by DC to get people to buy into their ultra-convoluted \\"crisis on infinite earths\\" story arc) Winick wrote a sharp witted story-arc with humor and some psychological depth. This was all lost in the dismal animated adaptation. Batman: Under The Red Hood undermines pretty much everything Winick did in the comic book counterpart. Jason is sorely underdeveloped; All we know about him is he was a cocky kid who once wore green tights as Batman's former side-kick. His years spent with Batman are simply set-up in quick excerpts. Jason's bitterness is aparent but it's superficial at best. I think the film's secound biggest crime was the absence of good humor. Judd Winick is primarily a cartoonist so funny dialogue isn't foriegn to him and the witty banter he wrote for Black Mask and Todd was entirely eliminated for the animated film. As a matter of fact, the only reason why I read this story more than once was mostly because of the humorous dialogue. One of my favorite lines was the following:    Joker (talking to Jason): Didn't I kill you ?  Jason: You said that already.  Joker: I know, I just like to keep saying it.    In general, the humor fell flat in this film. Many of the one-liners felt like poor TV sit-com garbage, mostly coming from the painfully flat Nightwing. Last the plot was just done so poorly. Most of this film is just fighting, the initimate moments of the original comic book story-arc were brushed aside such as Todd taunting Joker because he knows he isn't as crazy as he thought he was and dimissing Black Mask (who looks like a low-rent pimp in this movie) as just another thug with a gimmick. The biggest plot hole had to be Jason's plan to free the Joker from Arkham Asylum. How would Jason know Black Mask would recruit the Joker to stop him ? In the comic it made sense, Jason found the Joker and just kidnapped him. Why even place him Arkham at the time ?     I think I could probably go into another long and seperate rant about the flacid backgrounds and character designs and futility of being \\"reaslitic\\" in animation. However I'll just say that DC is better off making story-arcs like this into live-action films. You don't have to go on the scale of features but something DTV so you won't have to cut so much out in an animated adaptation. Lastly Warners can afford a stable of talented voice actors that are a lot cheaper then boring live action stars. Spare us all and get the casting right for these films.
B001MCOXIK|5.0|A lot of negativity surrounds this album.  I think most of the negativity is undeserved.  This is not Heaven and Hell or Mob Rules, but it is great work by that fits well into the catalogue of Black Sabbath.  The songs to me came across as a bit heavier overall than the first two studio albums Black Sabbath did with Dio.  To my ears it worked well.  Your not going to find a Heaven and Hell or Sign of the Southern Cross on this album, but you will find solid songs that are interesting, heavy, riff laden, and enjoyable.
B001DDBCV4|5.0|So how many guys are fans of Sex and The City? Well for one count me in. The first time I saw this picture I was a relative novice to Carrie and the girls. I love the city and the films great reverence to all that is NYC. The extended cut in blu-ray is the one to have. I love this picture; don't miss it!
B0011ZYKRC|5.0|This is King Diamonds first solo foray from Mercyful Fate.  The story telling that you will find in later King Diamond work is present here, but not as overblown and word for word as you might get in some later King Diamond work.  This is one of King Diamonds best works with any band (not his best, but one of his best).  Any fan of King Diamond or Mercyful Fate would be foolish to pass this one up.
B003ITZBVS|5.0|This is a great flick.  Not just a great cartoon movie, but a really great movie for anyone!
B00002N9ER|5.0|The price at Amazon makes it a no-brainer purchase to go along with your Maglite. I've installed three of these around the house. After six months of active use, I have not observed  any signs of cracking or yielding in the plastic.    A few reviewers have mentioned that they have managed to break a few of these, and this might be caused by improper installation. It is imperative that, when using two clips for a flashlight, that they are perfectly aligned. If they are out of line by even a few millimeters they will require much more force to place and remove the flashlight. Alternatively, using just one clip for at least the 3 cell lights seems to work just fine as well.    Overall, I am satisfied with this product and consider it to be a good value at the advertised price.
B000N3SSVM|5.0|Catchy percussion, strong keys and haunting vocals in a three-disc set makes this one of the best music deals I've seen in a long time; when The Knife gets their unique kind of 'dance music' right, they get it so right!<br /><br />Concert DVD also has Knife music videos and is immensely viewable.<br />Music concert CD takes different angles on existing tunes.<br /><br />A highly recommended combo ... buyers should accompany this one w/Deep Cuts.
B003JLA4KS|5.0|This is a great movie, the extras are great and it looks fantastic on Blu-ray. I am really happy to have it as a part of my Rush collection.
B002GZQYMK|5.0|This is actually the first Muse album I've listened to in its entirety. The 3 part concluding symphony is definitely the highlight of the album. Unlike other reviewers, I don't have a problem with the sharp shifts in styles found throughout \\"The Resistance.\\" I highly recommend this album to any lover of classic rock. Looking forward to delving into their catalog further.
1416972242|5.0|There are so many good comments about the book that I can only say \\"Fantastic story\\".
0877180121|5.0|I've been taking Piano lessons since the beginning of this year. This was the the book my Piano Teacher started me on. I'm an adult who knew nothing and I mean ABSOLUTELY nothing about the Piano.<br /><br />I knew nothing about where the Middle C is on the Piano or how many notes there are on the Piano. This book taught me how to read the all the notes and how to play them and very quickly too!!!<br /><br />Did I feel silly learning from this book??? No way... I wanted to learn how to play the Piano and this book got me started.<br /><br />It's been 7 months and I'm playing pretty good.<br /><br />Granted I'm no Liberace... but hey I don't mind. I'm having a BLAST!!! :[]<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn how to play the piano for the very first time.
0316044938|5.0|I cried when I read this book and when the movie came out I could not wait to see it!    I cried with the movie too because the story is so powerful and amazing. I recommend this book 100%
B0013Y1UHO|3.0|The Kindle edition is full of typos, photos and captions that are out of order and a lack of punctuation.  Lazy editing distracts from an otherwise good book.
B0036EH3XE|1.0|The first three seasons of Lost were amazing.  Season 4 was pretty good, and Season 5 was good. Season 6, however, was a complete disappointment. The ending was a total let-down and didn't explain anything. If anything, it made the series make less sense than before. If you're a Lost fan and have yet to watch season 6, I would recommend just not watching it. Make up your own ending, because it will be better.
B003ITZBVI|5.0|If done correctly like they have done with \\"Batman: Under the red hood\\" Robin would be one of the best characters to grace the big screen. I was floored how well they made this animated movie, not scared to show how low it can get to entertain its audience. More animated movies should take notes from this excellent creation. I just hope the movies quit shying away from characters not considered as being \\"Dark and gloomy\\" as Batman.. Just make them dark if that's their issue! As long as you stay true to the character making them dark won't be a problem. I'm sick of just seeing Batman getting all the screen time when their are other characters such as Robin, Nightwing and Batgirl who some of us can look forward too!     By the way I can see Jensen Ackles being perfect as the Red Hood or an older version of Jason Todd as Robin in the movies, throwing you pennies for your attention WB & CO..    GET A HINT!
B000BYA5G4|5.0|You can never go wrong with Nick Cage. Plus, based an an actual person, makes it all the more fun to watch. Thoroughly fun film.
0385296495|4.0|I used to enjoy DS novels. This one is from 1995 and is one of her best.
B0007M22TI|5.0|Just awesome. Wide variety of musical styles. Fantastic stage work, lovely costuming, orchestra is awesome. If you've never tried Celtic music before, this will make a fan of you!    :)
B00005N5S5|5.0|I can't tell you how many times I've watched this movie. Never mind its sequels, though. This is the only one really worth watching. This is one of my favorite action movies and I recommend it for anyone who likes them. Terminator rocks!
B002C6A6N6|5.0|I have always liked good wholesome family entertainment movies and TV series and i did raise my children on them as much as possible. Movies and TV series that promote good moral values. I feel that the Dr Quinn series is one of them and have enjoyed them very much for myself as my children are all grown up and out on their own now.
B00003CXA2|5.0|This is by far my favorite movie. Tom Hanks does agreat job, I loved the plot, it's a just great movie altogether. If you haven't seen it then I won't spoil it for you, but I assure you that you will love this movie. If you have a brain you'll buy it.
B003OF3R0S|3.0|Doesn't matter what I type here. The record has nearly moved half a million copies this past week and will probably go to 2 maybe 3 million when all is said and done with this record. I hear at least 3 maybe 4 radio songs on this record and with an extra 100-200,000 Dream Theater fans buying this for Portnoy...the AX7 crowd just got that much bigger on the ticket line.    Good for them as they have had a horrible tragedy to live through the last 8 months. Not their best effort but still a good record.
B002ZG980U|5.0|Every once in a while a movie comes along that makes you glad you've got a brain. That expects you to be intelligent enough to \\"get it.\\" There was the original Star Wars, the Matrix original and a few others i can't name right now. A movie that's like a runaway freight train that dares you to grab hold and go along for the ride. I was giggling happily through most of this movie because each time i thought the director had topped himself plot-wise he piled on more and more to the story that dared me to keep up. My mind reeled during the movie and even half a day later it's still reeling. Happy that I had that experience. Happy that there's a movie maker that wants to challenge me. Like when I first Star Wars or the Matrix. This is a darn good movie and i want some more.
B00375LMGQ|5.0|There is little to add to the excellent reviews on this book.  Nearly seventy years after its first publication in 1944 Brideshead Revisited continues to exert its spell over readers. The PBS series that aired during the 1980s was a routine topic at the \\"water cooler.\\" In fact, the office eventually organized group viewing sessions so we could drink while we watched the program.  It is not possible to ignore the role that Catholicism plays in this novel, but too much can be made of it as well, reducing the scope and importance of Charles Ryder's recollections.  What Brideshead accomplishes at the end of the novel is, in my view, quite remarkable.  To be sure, Book II of the novel can seem quite distinct from Book I, at least in that Waugh seems not to have laid the groundwork for the novel's fast moving ending.  And yet, there is, throughout Brideshead an emphasis on ritual, at Oxford, at the mansion, in the community and within the family.  At the end of the novel, it is ritual that forges ahead of belief -- the ritual of last rites for the family patriarch that seems to pull him to belief, not long after he (Alex) had told the attending priest:  \\"I am not in extremis and I have not been a practicing member of your church for twenty-five years.\\"  All that past hate did, in the end, turn out to be, as Cara, Lord Marchmain's mistress earlier told us, \\"something in [himself that he hated] (p 103).  Whatever one thinks of the outcome, Brideshead Revisited endures, not for the solution to which it points, but for the questions it raises.  Thus it remains relevant from WWII to the present.
B0026P3G12|3.0|It is a very good CD.  I watched her on TV and she looks like she is making a name for herself. Being in the public eye has changed her looks also.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|very pleased with the product arrived in a timely manner I highly recomend this seller
B00004CX97|1.0|The DVD I purchased will not play in any of my DVD players. It so put it in the trash !!!
0307474712|5.0|Dexter and Emma tell a story familiar to all of us in one way or another. Their relationship faces many trials, experiences and fate first hand.  The book set up and story is brilliantly written and descriptions are superb. I highly recommend!
0307474712|3.0|I was quite looking forward to reading One Day--but I should have ignored the hype.  Everything I read led me to believe I would be treated to a blend of High Fidelity and Bridget Jones Diary. Not really.  One Day tells the story of two young people beginning in 1988, focussing on one day (July 15) for each of the next twenty years.  The trick was almost too cute for me, although I will say that it makes sense at the end of the novel and ultimately gives the novel a little more depth than I originally gave it credit for.  What bothered me about this novel is that the two main characters, Emma and Dexter (particularly Dexter) are not particularly likable. If the writing were funnier, the characters middling personalities might not have bothered me at much.  I'm probably in the minority here, but I just did not think this novel deserves the hype it is getting.
B00127RAJY|1.0|I thought Jillian Michaels was a revolutionary trainer because of all the large and in charge people on The Biggest Loser that she's shrunk down. Well, she maybe but her work out DVD is the same old style of boring work outs and repetitive exercises that the work out DVD genre has always had. That and her \\"work out buddies\\" never once seem to be working out. You never see a drop of sweat, a grimaced expression, nothing. They all work out like smiling robots which means, THEY'RE NOT WORKING OUT!<br /><br />I highly recommend getting The Biggest Loser: Boot Camp with Bob Harper and Biggest Loser: Weight Loss Yoga, also with Bob. It has real people, as in formerly obese people doing the exercises. They sweat, they strain, they even cheat on some of the movements. It feels like your working out with people who are going through hell right along with you.<br /><br />Bottom line: Don't throw your money away on a old Hollywood style production work out DVD. This one needs to jump into a Delorian and travel back to the 80's so Jillian and her best gal pal work out buddies can get some neon colored leotards.
B002ZG997C|1.0|I have been reading the reviews - And was surprised that many people really liked this movie.  There are a few that didn't like this movie.  I am firmly in the camp of not liking the movie.  For me it was a Christian version of Mad Max and Fahrenheit 451. Where after a great apocalyptic religious war all the bibles were destroyed and the only one left is the one that Eli carries.<br /><br />SPOILERS  (So there I warned you)<br /><br />Although we know that this movie would be in part have Christian over tones, if anyone is familiar with Christianity, they would know the name Eli. Eli does the Christian's (g)od `s will in the Christian Bible (Old Testament)  Eli is a Judge Priest .  Eli over time loses his eye sight and becomes blind.<br /><br />We see elements of this in the movie. As for a religious movie - It showed a man wandering for 30 years bleak stricken and horrifying remains of what was the United States.  People have turned to cannibalism to survive, eating what we would consider pets, and people reduced to lawlessness.<br /><br />I have no problem with the level of violence - I loved the mad max movies - Because it's fantasy it's not real.  Yes, eating a cat was disturbing, and although I was upset, but the point was, that these are hard times, pets are food, and people will do what they need to survive.<br /><br />We see Eli do things to survive and I have no problem with that.<br /><br />I can even understand Carnegie desire for the Christian Bible, he believes in it's power, to create a society of order, his order, but order none-the-less. He lusts for the power that he believes that it will bring. I can even understand why he might send out people who can't read to search for it. (Although, really, wouldn't you want someone who could read, and have some kind of intelligence find something this important?  Wouldn't you want someone who could at least think?  Be able to reason where it would be? If all the bibles were burned, would it really make sense to send out goons to find it, wouldn't you want learned people and search out place that might have hoarded one, two or three? And please, don't tell me that people would just blindly (yea I know pun) not have digital versions tucked away somewhere? Or whatever... )<br /><br />Getting back to the movie - I expected great acting from Denzel and Oldman. Neither came through, I felt like they phoned in scenes. I wasn't convinced (SPOILER Alert) at the end that Eli was blind.<br /><br />I wasn't convinced of the total breakdown of society would break down even more when Carnegie was near death.<br />The major problem I had with the ending where we find out that the Bible was Braille, was that the New King's James Version of the bible isn't one book, it takes 20 Volumes - YES--that means 20 books - for one written bible.  So, Eli's one volume Braille bible is unbelievable.<br /><br />Other problems I have with the movie is, if Eli is on (g)od's journey, why didn't he stop the woman from being raped? I know he is not meant to be perfect and we see this to show later when he admits not being perfect. So, a woman is allowed to get raped because the main character needs to realize that he isn't perfect?  Humm... I have issues with that.<br /><br />The movie seemed to drag, then get an action scene, then drag, then action. The amount of action left you wanting more of an explanation then you got. I didn't find it thought provoking or something unique or interesting.  I found it boring, clich&eacute;d, predictable, and underwhelming.<br /><br />There was really no pay off at the end, because you knew that Eli, although protected by (g)od through the movie was now allowed to die, after of course he recited the complete New King James Bible.<br /><br />I would have liked to know more about Eli before the war. I would have liked to know what he was, why he was so convinced that he was being played by his (g)od. I would have liked to know what really brought on the destruction, other than it was some kind of religious war.
B002VPE1OS|4.0|Like most iPhone purchasers, I got a clear screen cover when I bought a case at the time I got my phone.  The screen cover quickly got scratched up, though, so when I was offered a pack of 3 new covers free through the Vine Review program at Amazon, I took them up on it, asking my wife (whose dexterity stat is better than mine) to install them on both our phones.  She did and we've been using them now for more than a month.  The strong points are that the cover seems much tougher than the one that came with my Speck case and has a lot less glare.  It also seems less prone to developing bubbles along the edge.<br /><br />The trick is that although the package comes with good directions and aids to cleaning the screen and applying the screen cover so as to minimize bubbles, it is still a bit tricky to do perfectly and you are almost bound to have one or two small bubbles where there was a microscopic mote on the screen when the cover was applied.  My recommendation is that you should not attempt to reapply the screen cover--it will only get worse, and it is a darn good cover.<br /><br />One odd thing, although the covers are in a small package that could have easily fit into an envelope, Amazon shipped mine in a huge, long, narrow box for no discernible reason.  Oh well, at least I recycle my cardboard.
0545123275|4.0|Shiver is a Young Adult supernatural romance novel written by Maggie Stiefvater.  It is the story of Grace and Sam.  Grace is a 17 yr old girl that lives with her parents who are rarely around so she is pretty much raising herself.  Grace's home is on the edge of woods that are occupied by a pack of wolves.  Many years earlier Grace was snatched from her tire swing by the wolves and nearly killed as they ripped and pulled at her but she was saved by one yellow eyed wolf that pushed the others away and pulled her to safety.  For many years she sat out and watched her wolf as he came around watching her equally as fascinated.  She knew these wolves were special but she didn't know just how special until she met Sam.  Meeting Sam revealed a whole world to her that was thought to be fairy tale, a world of shape shifting... werewolves, as some might call it.  Once infected with the disease a human would begin shifting into wolf form, mostly with cold weather, but randomly in the beginning.  Sam and Grace have shared a bond and affection from the moment he saved her from the pack years before.  But something baffles Sam... Grace was bit, many times over, and she never changed.  Why?  What was special about Grace that she remained human and held onto the life that Sam grieves every day.  How long does Sam have in his human form before the cold of winter and the wolf take him over, maybe for good.<br /><br />The story of Sam and Grace is sweet.  Grace's parents are non-existent and even when they are around they are written to be scattered and the mom quite ditsy.  Without giving away any of the story I can't really tell more but you will understand if you read it.  I actually really enjoyed reading this as a light \\"fluff\\" read.  Not much substance and the characters aren't very deep but I just loved the story of Sam and Grace in its simplicity.  It can easily be read in a day and would be a good easy picnic or beach read.<br /><br />I have purchased book two \\"Linger\\" (didn't know it was going to be a series when I got the first one) and hope to read it this week as well.  I think that I might give this book 3.5 stars out of 5 (4 out of 5 if you're a YA fan).<br /><br />***Spoilers***<br />As far as your teens reading it, there are no language issues.  There is the situation with the parents and behind their back she speaks of them with little respect and feels a bit superior to them.  I didn't care for the way the parents were written in, but I suppose there are parents out there that are just this way.  Sam lives in Grace's home sleeping in Grace's bed with her for a couple of weeks without the parents knowing because they never even peek in her room at night to check on her when they get home. There is a lot of cuddling, touching, kissing and they do have sex in her room while her parents are out (which is always).  They talk about how it was the right time and they used protection so that makes it perfect and good.going to be a series when I got the first one) and hope to read it this week as well.

I didn't care for the way the parents were written in, but I suppose there are parents out there that are just this way.  Sam lives in Grace's home sleeping in Grace's bed with her for a couple of weeks without the parents knowing because they never even peek in her room at night to check on her when they get home. There is a lot of cuddling, touching, kissing and they do have sex in her room while her parents are out (which is always).  They talk about how it was the right time and they used protection so that makes it perfect and good.
B002ZG9788|1.0|Wow, not even sure where to begin. This movie was so bad I couldn't even finish watching it and I really enjoyed the original. The writers of this piece of garbage felt the need to completely change major elements of the story, the origin of characters and even which god is angered by comparing Cassiopea's beauty to that of Aphrodite.  Yet another remake of a 70's-80's film that pales in comparison to the original. Even though the Harryhausen effects of the original were dated they worked better than the CGI in the update.  If you are a fan of the original, don't waste your time and unless you are a fan of worthless drivel you will hate this lemon that jumps the shark in the first 5 minutes.
B003J8RI8M|5.0|I actually got this for a close friend who wanted to go down memory lane, but, of course, I had to listen in. It got here in less time than expected and was in PERFECT condition,. Might as well have been shrink-wrapped. Timeless Prince.  As good this morning as it was in college.
B002ZG977Y|3.0|A long time ago there were big, chaotic, uncontrollable gods, the Titans, who ruled the Earth and gave birth to new gods who destroyed them and created man, in order to gain power from their worship.  But men, being men, resented the arbitrary whims of the gods and it was inevitable they'd fight back.  Hades, the god of the underworld, hit upon a plan to bring fear into the hearts of men so they'd worship again.  He'd release the Kraken, a giant sea monster, and destroy a city, but at the same time gain enough power to overpower Zeus, the king of the gods.  It turned out, though, that a forgotten and resentful son of Zeus happened to be hanging around and had a motive and enough pluck to fight back.  (If you've seen [[ASIN:B003HARV3Y Percy Jackson & The Olympians: The Lightning Thief]], or if you've read the book you'll notice that it's nearly the same story, with slight variations, but the movie this is based on came first, and the Greek myths both movie and the book are loosely based on came long before that).<br /><br />While sacrificing story to CGI, this update of the original [[ASIN:B002ZD3V10 Clash of the Titans]] manages to be entertaining enough for a popcorn family night, but not enough to come anywhere near the inventiveness and excitement of the original. Sure the original had its kitchy moments - with celebrities playing the preening gods - but it felt fresh.  I remember begging to see it as a kid when it first came out and wanting to go back right away - I even had the board game based on the movie.  This one, by contrast, feels highly derivative and only adds to the original an intensity that detracts from the characters and computer generated effects that are only partially convincing.  In the original the effects weren't convincing either, but they were clever and inventive and it felt like an illusion, it gave the feeling of a story being told, rather than a dream pretending to be real.<br /><br />The opening sequence, that tells the story of the gods against the backdrop of the constellations, was my favorite part of the film.  After that, the portrayal of the gods by Liam Neeson as Zeus and Ralph Fiennes as Hades, who both brought the required gravitas to the mix; Jason Flemyng as Calibos and Mads Michelson as Draco were also top notch, and managed to import feeling and plausibility into some implausible and over the top hokey dialogue.  Sam Worthington, unfortunately, didn't convince me as Perseus, especially given a performance that was even more wooden and less nuanced than his performance in Avatar, where at least it seemed to fit the situation.<br /><br />The action is far too busy, for the most part; too much was going on during a fight scene to have much more than a sense of chaos mixed with awe and tension, when what is needed and was sorely lacking here is a stronger sense of identification with who is being attacked by whom and what is at stake in every moment of the battle scenes.  Still, on the whole, I have to say that while I wasn't overwhelmed and on the edge of my seat I was enjoying it.  My wife and kids, who watched it with me, seemed to have fun as well, and afterwards gave it a tentative thumbs up: \\"yeah, that was okay, Dad.\\"  If you don't go into it expecting much, you won't be disappointed and may even enjoy it.  If you do, check out the original, which is much more fun.ods against the backdrop of the constellations, was my favorite part of the film.

B002VPE1Z2|4.0|This is a nice camera case that is well made.  It has a flap that uses a velcro fastener and a belt loop that also uses a velco fastener (I would have preferred stitched).  This is convenient, but some might prefer a clasp or something more secure. That said, I had no problem and everything worked as it should.<br /><br />The case will hold a small compact point and shoot camera and it has a zippered front pocket for memory cards or batteries.  I used mine to carry my 4.3\\" Garmin GPS which fit perfectly.  It would also work for a cell phone, mp3 player or other small electronics device.<br /><br />This is a casual, convenience case good for light trips and everyday use.  If you're going hiking or mountain climbing, you'll need something more secure.  It is plush/padded inside and I find it very convenient for my GPS and carry-around compact camera.  Looks like it will last a long time as good materials were used throughout.<br /><br />I'm giving 4 stars because I think a stitched belt loop would be a lot safer (though the velcro is more convenient) and I'd prefer a clasp for the flap as well.  But the velcro has held well so far, so maybe it's good enough.  ;)<br /><br />8/2/10 Update:  Also note there is no carrying strap w/this case.  For the current price with free shipping, I am ordering two more because it's a nice padded case for delicate gear like a compact camera, GPS, etc.  I will use the case to hold the gear which will be kept in a larger carry bag.  Also for my gear laying about the house and car.  Cheap enough to have a couple on hand for various uses.
0307594777|5.0|Simply the best female character in the last fifty years.  She comes to life and drags you into her world.  I hated when it was over knowing he planned to write 10 books and passed away leaving us three brilliant novels and us wanting more.  All three novels are a must.
B0024FAG5I|1.0|I do not own this movie on bluray or DVD but I do have it on VHS. The only reason I have this movie at all is I got involved in a video club many years ago and it was free. This movie has only one plot, turn gunfighting into a sport. That's it! A couple of hours (not sure how long the film is since I've only wathed it once) of two people standing in the street shooting at each other. The one that looses is dragged off and another one steps up. Terrible! Those that know history know that gunfights in the old west was not as prevailent as in the movies for a couple of reasons. First, you could die, second, guns were not very acurate, third, ammo was expensive. I love westerns for the stories they tell about life back then but this dog has none of that. I've tried to give this movie away several times and thought I was sucessful a couple of times but it always came back mysteriously. If you love westerns, stay way from this one!!! The only reason I gave this movie one star is because I couldn't give it the negative 5 stars it deserves!!
B002VPE1Z2|3.0|This camera case is reasonably well made and has the limited features one expects in the price range. It is black nylon with Velcro closures for both the top flap and the beltloop on the back. The zippered storage compartment for accessories and flash cards that sits just under the top flap is itself almost big enough to hold my son's Canon SD1000. The main compartment is so big that my Canon S90, not the smallest P&S camera, kinda swims in it. I think it may be big enough for a G11, but I didn't check. Just for the fun of it, I have posted a video of me inserting my S90 in a Canon case (old one for my S400) and subsequently putting both into the ABUCC.<br /><br />So, enough ranting about how big it is. How well does it work?<br /><br />Pros:<br />* Sturdy, well padded.<br />* Black, which I like because it doesn't show the inevitable grime that happens when you use something like this a lot.<br />* Closures actually hold well.<br />* Has a belt loop.<br />* Zippered front accessory pouch.<br /><br />Cons:<br />* It's bigger than most of us need for our pocketable point and shoots. I think this will end up having me go back to keeping my S90 in my pocket.<br />* The belt loop has the convenience feature of a velcro closure, but this makes it able to be ripped off by a street thief. I also don't know how long the Velcro will keep its aggressive hold on the beltloop if you use this method for putting the case on and off a lot. I would have preferred a standard permanent mount for the loop.<br /><br />Summary:<br />You should check out the dimensions (Interior is about 5\\" x 3\\" x 1.5\\") of this case vs. your camera before purchasing because it is likely your modern digital camera is too small for it.

I fly a lot and one of the 3 books seems to be what everybody is reading. Read it before the American version of the movie is made and released.
B003ODL004|5.0|Many here have reviewed this musical work by focusing on the more upbeat, thundering numbers like \\"Dream is collapsing\\".<br />But what grabs me so wonderfuly, is the slower pieces which evoke such grace, mood and emotional pull.<br />Just listen to \\"One simple idea\\", the second half of \\"Dream within a dream\\" or \\"528491.  Something like \\"Old souls\\" and \\"waiting for a train\\" illuminate the quiet and reminds one of what John Barry had such a command of.  Musical cues as these highten scenes in a movie.  They draw one in and stay with you.  Like when I saw \\"Memento\\", it was that undercurrent of a theme that haunted through the entire film.  It is not the same without it.

B003ITZBW2|5.0|Still mourning the loss of Robin \\"Jason, not Dick Grayson\\" at the hands of the Joker (voiced by John DiMaggio), Batman finds himself up against a new enemy that calls himself the Red Hood (Jensen Ackles). The Red Hood cleans up Gotham as well but unlike Batman, killing is an option.<br /><br />  While trying to stop the Red Hood, Batman finds himself up against Ra's Al Ghul (Jason Isaacs), The Joker and Black Mask. Batman gets help from Nightwing (Neil Patrick Harris) but he rather work alone since he blames himself for the death of Jason.<br /><br />  Batman: Under the Red Hood is easily the best Batman animated film...ever! It has plenty of intrigue, action and it's also surprisingly very violent. The film is crowded with villains, even a Riddler cameo, yet the movie isn't a mess like Spider-Man 3. All of the villains fit into the plot extremely well. I didn't expect the movie to be so well made that dare I say, it's almost as good as the Dark Knight. I strongly recommend this movie! I want more Batman animated films like this!
0205606288|5.0|Shakespeare requires no introduction -- he is \\"the Bard,\\" the most imposing playwright and storyteller in the English language. And \\"The Complete Pelican Shakespeare\\" brings together every one of his plays, ranging from harrowing tragedies to airy little puffs of comedy -- and even the lesser plays are still brilliant.<br /><br />The plays basically are divided into comedies, histories and tragedies. The tragedies are pretty much... tragic, the comedies are not always funny but end semi-happily, and the histories... well, dramatizations of history.<br /><br />And everybody has heard of the greats here -- the Scottish lord who murders his way to kingship, young lovers divided by a feud, a Moorish general who is driven mad with jealousy, an elderly king whose arrogance rips his life apart, a very cleaned-up version of Henry VIII's split from his first wife, the goofy Prince Hal and his growth into a great king. There are feuding fairies, bickering lovers, romantic tangles, Julius Caesar's demise, gender-bending, an exiled duke/magician on his island, and the infamous \\"pound of flesh\\" bargain.<br /><br />But Shakespeare also wrote a bunch of lesser-known plays that often can't be so neatly categorized -- a rotten love affair during the siege of Troy, a Roman general attacking his own city, an Athenian gentleman embittered by humanity, Richard III's Machiavellian plot to become king, two sets of twins separated at birth, a corrupt judge obsessed with a lovely nun, Falstaff's doomed efforts to make money, and so on. Some of these (\\"Troilus and Cressida\\") aren't nearly as good as his \\"main\\" body of work, but they're still excellent.<br /><br />For all Shakespeare's plays, it's best to read them AFTER you've seen a good performance. Otherwise, it's like reading a movie script to a movie you haven't seen -- easy to get lost, and the dramatic effects aren't easy to connect to. But if you've seen performances of any/all of Shakespeare's plays, then his vibrant stories and poetry leap off the page.<br /><br />There are long eloquent speeches, puns, clever linguistic twists, and evocative language that soaks the play in atmosphere (\\"With sweet musk-roses and with eglantine/There sleeps Titania sometime of the night/Lull'd in these flowers with dances and delight...\\"). In fact, his plays are diamond mines of quotations -- some are infamous (\\"To be or not to be\\") and some of which have floated into public knowledge without labels (\\"Cowards die many times before their deaths/The valiant never taste of death but once\\").<br /><br />And while some of his plays are basically fluff, he manages to weave in moral questions, criticism and explorations of the human soul. And his characters range as far as his plots -- kings and princes, teenage lovers, proud but doomed men, bratty queens, the witty but combative Beatrice and Benedick, and even the puppet-master mage Prospero.<br /><br />Shakespeare's \\"Complete Works\\" is a must-have for anyone who loves the English language -- his writing was unparalleled, and even his lesser plays are a cut above the rest.here are long eloquent speeches, puns, clever linguistic twists, and evocative language that soaks the play in atmosphere (\\"With sweet musk-roses and with eglantine/There sleeps Titania sometime of the night/Lull'd in these flowers with dances and delight...\\").

B002QKZLZ6|5.0|My wife makes fun of me because I break my headsets all the time. I realized the problem is that I put it in my cargo pants pocket or my laptop case with no protection, and it is just too rough on it. So, I bought this little case for my new headset and it works wonderfully. The best part is that there is a hard edge on the side that the microphone goes in, and it is a snug fit. This protects it completely. I put the headset in and throw it in my cargo pockets, no harm done.
B00005221L|5.0|I got the bare-bones DVD version of the first Predator film, starring Arnold Schwarzenegger as Dutch, the head of a crack military unit whose guys are hired for extraction or rescue mission jobs. Dutch has a sense of honor that Arnold plays well in all his action films.  His men will follow him anywhere.  He is resourceful and demands a high military standard.  His unit is called in on a \\"rescue\\" mission which he's not too happy about.  And his pal whom he thought he could trust, will go in charge of his unit!  Hell!<br /><br />The battle scenes when they ambush a bunch of South American militants is right out of a Rambo movie, except smartly played.  Schwarzenegger shows off his weightlifting roots in one scene as he blows up, chops up, and stabs his way through the compound.  I love these cheesy lines:  \\"Stick around!\\" as he stabs a guy through to the wall!  Vicious!<br /><br />As vicious as these guys are, they find they themselves are the hunted.  Hunted by a being from space who has a code of honor as strong and as vicious as Dutch's.  As his pals get skinned alive and their skulls become part of the Predator's collection, the rest of the film is pitting wits against wits -- blood and sweat against advanced alien tech.  Who will win?<br /><br />The Predator is a cool creature -- \\"ugly as hell\\" and yet recognizes when his prey is worthy of a true knock-down, drag-out fight!  The other army punks and such are cardboard in their acting and characterization, frankly.  It's really Arnold's film.<br /><br />Now that I've seen this film I really understand a lot of the innuendo in the last film, Predators, that was released this summer.  Exciting action/adventure film, some gore and very little sympathy.

1881273156|4.0|I read this book several years ago and wanted to read it again.  I am in a new relationship and I think the concept can provide great insight into making relationships better.  The five languages of love are written words, spoken word, acts of kindness, time spent, gifts.  Different forms of expression of love mean more to different people.  Being conscious of what is important to your partner can make for a better relationship.

030745455X|5.0|The Millenium series, of which this is volume 2, share a dark view of the human condition.  Evil is everywhere, leavened only by the answering kindness and willingness to get involved of some people.  It's probably a pretty fair assessment of reality.  This book is just as dark as volume 1 (Girl w the Dragon Tatoo), so I recommend that you plan on also reading the 3rd volume (Girl Who Kicked the Hornets' Nest) which ravels it all up again, and sheds some sunlight (and hope) into the story.  Because, in the end, it is one story and one book.<br /><br />The books are long, but gripping.  The characters are very believable - you come to feel of them as friends (when they allow it) and you root for them.  The writing is nearly faultless - surprising, given their author's inexperience at this genre - and the translations are superb.  I'm looking forward to the Swedish movies made from these books.

B003L20IHE|3.0|\\"Charlie St. Cloud\\" would be the love child of a Nicholas Sparks novel and an M. Night Shyamalan film, were such a thing possible. It's on the one hand a relentlessly sentimental tearjerker and on the other hand a supernatural mystery, with a throwaway plot twist added for good measure. To say this film is awful would be harsh. Still, it certainly doesn't aspire to be anything more than what it so obviously is, so seeing this movie really isn't necessary - unless, of course, you're a tweenybopper hoping to lose yourself in the dreamy recesses of Zac Efron's eyes. That may, in fact, be the only reason he was cast, since the role is so generic that any actor could have played it to more or less the same effect. I suppose it doesn't really matter; his performance is decent enough, and I'm sure he will someday be recognized as the dramatic actor he always wanted to be.    Adapted from Ben Sherwood's novel \\"The Death and Life of Charlie St. Cloud,\\" the premise is that the title character, played by Efron, gains the ability to see ghosts after surviving a car accident. One of the ghosts is his kid brother, Sam (Charlie Tahan), who unfortunately was in the car when it crashed. Every day at sunset, the two meet in a secluded spot in the woods to play catch, since, in life, Sam was a devoted Baseball fan. It's a nice idea, although the filmmakers never take full advantage of Charlie's sixth sense, not even after he gives up on college and yacht racing, stays in his seaside hometown, and becomes a cemetery groundskeeper. The details of the plot prevent me from elaborating on this, but rest assured, he doesn't see anywhere near as many dead people as you might think.    Despite his reputation as a nutcase (which is itself painfully underdeveloped), Charlie attracts the attention of local yacht enthusiast Tess Carroll (Amanda Crew), who hopes to sail around the world and tests herself by heading into rough, stormy waters. As their relationship turns romantic, Sam - or rather, his ghost - begins to worry that he will be forgotten. Tess, in turn, tells Charlie that, at some point, he has to let go. He can't let go, he tells Tess. He made Sam a promise. This, of course, will be challenged in due time, although I'm afraid I can't say any more than that.    I'm making this sound like a complete film, but the truth is that everything about \\"Charlie St. Cloud\\" feels oddly condensed and unfocused. It's well established, for example, that Charlie can speak to Sam's ghost, but that's about it as far as character development is concerned. Never once do we see anything resembling brotherly love - anything, at least, the goes beyond the obvious spectacle of a young man and a boy playing catch in the woods. Likewise, we don't see any real love blooming between Charlie and Tess, maybe because (1) it happens far too quickly for us to believe it, and (2) we don't know that much about either one of them. For all I know, this may be more an issue of editing than of how the screenplay was written. Whatever the case, the film is so sparse that, even when it leads to something thematically, characteristically, or structurally, there's no sense that anything has led anywhere.    Other touches, like Charlie's encounter with the paramedic who saved his life (Ray Liotta), do little more than serve as an excuse for sermonizing. I don't mind being sermonized to, but the message involved has to have some thematic significance. What this movie tells us about life, living, and letting go is ultimately so broad and disconnected from the material that it fails to resonate. It's bad enough that the paramedic just happens to be sick with cancer upon reuniting with Charlie; this isn't plot advancement, but emotional manipulation, and that never, ever works when presented so obviously. At least, it never, ever works for me. This is the kind of overwrought storytelling that keeps me at a distance from Nicholas Sparks film adaptations. It seems he has had quite an influence. Will no one learn from his mistakes?    I will give this movie credit for its cinematography, with wonderful shots of picturesque harbors, open waters, and quaint shacks filling the scenery. A sequence of Efron and Crew frolicking through a foggy, moonlit cemetery is especially memorable; what would normally be associated with the Universal horror movies of old is instead a surprisingly effective example of high romance, if not mild eroticism. The film looks so good that it's a shame more of an effort wasn't put into the plot, the tone, and the characters. \\"Charlie St. Cloud,\\" despite having its heart in the right place, is too sappy, too meandering, and too weak in its story. The only real draw this movie has for audiences is Zac Efron, although it may be a moot point since he's actively trying to outgrow his teen heartthrob status.
0439023483|5.0|Spoilers!     I was captivated from the first chapter and all the way to that cliffhanger ending! I have noticed a lot of comments on the fact that Katniss doesn't have the voice of a 16 year old girl, but I think that you would sound older too, if you have gone through what she had. Single handedly feeding her mother and sister, braving the hardships of the woods, and winding up in the Hunger Games.    I loved how everything was described, there wasn't too much scenery description, but I thought that that fit Katniss, who strikes me as the type of person who pays more attention to what's hiding, rather than what's actually there.    I love how attached Katniss is to Prim, her little sister, I really have to think that that is who Katniss loves the most.It's proven when Katniss decides she will have to try and win the Games, even though it would be nearly impossible for her, because her sister begged her to. Also, Katniss gets attached to Rue (my favorite character), because of her similarity to Prim. And when Rue dies, it's almost like her own sister has died.    I also enjoyed how Katniss battled her way through the Games, facing a new adventure and challenge around every corner. I also found myself really immersed in Katniss's feelings, when she's scared, I find myself feeling the same way, and I cried when Rue died, and I loved the song Katniss sung to Rue.    Overall, I think that this book is for ages 11 and up, and that it is the type of book to read over and over again!
B003OF3R0S|2.0|I pre-ordered this album and couldn't wait to get it.  Amazon got it to my door on Tuesday.  What a letdown...    What happened to this band?  The songs are slow, and mostly the same tempo. The guitars are no longer driving the music, but sadly following along.   The great hooks are gone (You guitar players know what i'm talking about).  There isn't one memorable riff after 5 listens.  The Cd is hard to listen to after the 5th track.  Ug...  Portnoy plays it safe, which was wise of him.      These sellouts with skull tattoos and batwings all over them wanna go into the studio and whine. It sounds they would rather be doing anything but making this record.  It sounds completely forced.  I would think after their loss, they would be upset and go into the studio fired up and mad as hell.  I wouldn't even call this metal.  Jimmy must have been the metalhead in the group.  He will be missed.    Long live fast melodic metal.

B001VNB54A|1.0|I rated this mini-series one star, in honor of those who fell during the war in the Pacific.  I you invest 220 million US dollars in a mini-series, you'd expect the main characters to be portrayed with a minimum of depth.  Some battle scenes were depicted in a reasonable way, but the sum of its parts, is less than what we expected from Spielberg and Hanks, who did a great job with Band of Brothers. Maybe the problem lies just there: after Band of Brothers, you'd expect at least the same quality with The Pacific. Unfortunately, Spielberg and Hanks failed to privide the goods.They tried to combine a more personal touch, by showing the characters with their families and added a few sex scenes.  This didn't raise the quality of The Pacific.  It's true that Band of Brothers didn't show any family background scenes with its main characters, but that didn't prevent from Band of Brothers to be one of the best mini-series ever, if not THE best. If you already invest so much money, efforts and time in a mini-series(overfour years), how is it possible to STILL produce a dud? It only proves that even uber-producers Spielberg and Hanks can make mistakes.  The Pacific was such a huge mistake.

B003RV43X4|2.0|Having loved the original film, campy as it was, I was looking forward to this new take on the story, but with marginal special effects and a bizarre interpretation of both mythology and the original screenplay, this was movie was a massive disappointment.<br /><br />It had an illogical tangled mess of a plot, wooden performances, and an oppressive score.  This film was entirely humorless and took itself far to seriously.<br /><br />I guess that's a couple of hours I'll never get back.  : (

1594202559|4.0|As one who is relatively uneducated in the ways of the financial world, I found this book rather easy to read and understand. I was particularly interested in how the author turned around my thinking about hedge funds. I had thought they were probably at the root of the financial disaster, and here, found that not to be true.  As for the New Elite in the book title, the people examined by the author don't seem to be new, at least to me, as I have been reading about them for years. I would say a new light has been shined upon them however.   I would highly recomend this book to anyone questioning the workings of hedge funds.
0307454541|1.0|If there is such a thing as a woman's novel, then this must be the antithesis-- a men's novel. The main character Mikael Blomkvist, has no emotional life, no self-reflection, no growth as a character, and doesn't have deep feelings or cares. The mystery at the center of the book is the only thing preventing him from being a cardboard figure (like all of the Vangers, characters in the novel who are not developed fully). All of his needs are gratified. His sexual conquests include every woman character except the one that is missing, Harriet (just give him time, I suppose, and she will be on the list). Oh, and by the way, they all pursued him!  His ex-wife and daughter never intrude on his life. Like a true male fantasy, the central theme of the novel allows him to prove himself and get full revenge against his enemies and have two women competing to be his partner. The book has episodes of cheap violence that are not essential to the theme. Testosterone, anyone?<br /><br />It was interesting for me to learn that the title of the book in the original Swedish was \\"M&auml;n som hatar kvinnor\\" or \\"Men who hate women,\\" renamed for some reason in the English translation to The Girl with The Dragon Tattoo. The original title actually describes the focus of the book pretty well.<br /><br />While reading, I would often put the book down and wonder to myself, Why are we supposed to care? What character were we supposed to connect with? Even the scenery is flat. The author apparently doesn't like descriptive language (for example, whenever Blomkvist is going into town or running by the harbor, the author is downright abstemious about the visual details or mood, or, perhaps, just too lazy to conjure a scene.) The only exceptions are the sections with the sadistic sex scenes, in which Larsson clearly revels.<br /><br />Those scenes were repellant for me and not just because of the violent acts they depict. These are the rare occasions in which the author invites the reader in to see and feel what a character is experiencing. The author is deliberately working the scenes to make the reader uncomfortable. It is as if the author has become the impassive figure at the edge of the bed, and the reader his squirming victim. No thanks!<br /><br />The way the book has been marketed is ironic. \\"Mesmerizing, \\" one critic from USA Today said (on the back of the book).  Don't you wish?  For me it was one flat and boring scene after another, with no emotional life, no reflection, no depth, no description, and finally, no humanity.<br /><br />Finally, besides being pedestrian the book was not well crafted. I found it very hard to get into this book. I started it over and over and had to re-read the first part more than once. I looked for an emotional \\"hook\\" and never found one.  Unbelievably, the central plot wasn't even introduced until after page 100, and there wasn't much in the lead off chapters to hold our attention. The mystery of what happened to Harriet was the only thing that kept me reading, but I wouldn't describe the outcome as particularly compelling. Even the villains are cardboard and lack motive and depth. The religious angle --supposedly the clue that cracks the case-- is never explained. The deliberate edginess of the character Lisbeth Salander put me off and I never felt sympathetic toward her. The chapter headings, mimicking a financial report of a business deal, were somewhat amusing.<br /><br />When I bought this book, the woman who waited on me told me that others had highly recommended this book but that she didn't particularly like it. I wish I could have had a longer conversation with her. It's a mystery to me that the book got so many positive reviews. I decided I'm going to tell other book lovers I know exactly why I wouldn't recommend reading this one.r is experiencing.

B002VPE1Z2|4.0|AmazonBasics Universal Camera Case<br /><br />This camera case is very spartan in terms of styling and features. The belt loop actually has a hook and loop patch (Velcro) so you can mount it on your belt without having to remove your belt. When you open the main compartment, there's a small zippered pouch that can hold cables, small SD cards, or spare batteries. The zipper is rubberized and has the Amazon logo with orange text for a dot and the word \\"Basics\\". This is very plain, but reminds us that we have a product sold by one of the best retailers in the world.<br /><br />The main compartment is padded on 5 sides, and it is very thick padding might I add. My Casio Exilim EX-H10 (10x optical, 12.1 MP) digital camera fits perfectly with room to spare. In fact, this is one reason I'm going to stick with my Lowepro Ridge 30 case for this camera. The EX-H10 is a very slim digital camera - about 3 iPhones thick. I can put it in my polo shirt pocket and it wouldn't be a bother at all. The Ridge 30 case is a tad smaller than the AmazonBasics case, so it is more compact and convenient to haul around on holiday. However, the AmazonBasics case isn't large by any measure, it is just a tad larger than my Ridge 30. That said, the AmazonBasics has enough padding to adequately protect any digital camera and wins bonus points in this regard.<br /><br />Pros: Simplistic, easy to use, has a belt loop that uses Velcro for easy mounting. Thick padding all around for protecting expensive digital cameras.<br /><br />Cons: Slightly larger than what I had expected, very plain on the outside - looks like any typical dollar store camera case. Minimal storage options.<br /><br />Overall: 4/5
B000TXZVGQ|3.0|This show had it's entertaining moments, but I found it to be stereotypical and very unrealistic.  I first watched it as a teen, and my life was nothing whatsoever like those of the characters in the show.  The same goes for the lives of all my friends.  I also found the main character to be very annoying.  Angela tried to be deep but always ended up sounding like a depressed valley girl instead.  You had the stereotypical depressed, oppressed teens and also the stereotypical makeup-wearing gay male.  I don't get what all the hype was about really.
044024367X|3.0|I have burned through these novels all summer and love them. Yes, some are MUCH better than others, but all are good.  This one I thought was excellent the first 2/3 of the book.  Lots of mystery, tension, action.. then suddenly Mr. Child felt it necessary to impose his views through Reacher.  Remember, this is a journey man, former military, all action, and takes the law into his own hands... but then suddenly he begins this bent towards supporting AWOLs, tearing down Christians, and cheating on a husband is just fine.  It all came across in bad writing...I paraphrase..\\"your husband is a veritable and won't know, so lets do it anyways.\\" Regardless of the fact he was a fellow military man and was injured serving his country. Sex does not make a novel and I would be perfectly happy if it was omitted.  This novel especially felt contrived. On one hand we hear how awful he looks in clothes, etc... but then women can't keep their hands off him???    As to the story.. the ending felt rushed and this was the first I thought..\\"what the heck about this....\\" I never figured out the town story.    Its 3 stars b/c most of the book is 5 star worthy, but the OUT OF CHARACTER political views with the confusing ending ruined it for me. It felt as though they could only go into Despair so many times and Child just limped the story to the finish line.

According to the bio, this book is the culmination of several years of backpacking through the country: a feat very few people would attempt.<br /><br />Although I have never been to China, this book makes me want to go there.  If I don't make it there, at least paging through this book I am magically transported to this land far far away.
0571238343|4.0|The best part of this book is its recognition of the PROCESS of learning something as marvelously complex as cartoon animation.  It is filled with anecdotal views of what and how one learns to do it all better and more believably.  It also captures the skills and determination of many of the great artists from the golden age of animation.<br /><br />It is also unapologetic about being entirely about cartoon (drawn) animation, even though the author does recognize that most of the principles he discusses have validity to all forms of animation.<br /><br />As a teacher (and student) of animation, I enjoyed reading this book from cover to cover.  The first 20 pages are a useful summary of the main historical moments in the development of animation, and the next 15 are all about Life Drawing skills, and the next four talk about basic animation timing.  The first real anecdote of many breaks in at this point, and then the author returns to direct information exposition thereafter, but these anecdotes can often make it somewhat distracting to find the useful bits amongst the reminiscences.<br /><br />Nevertheless, it's worth the read in spite of the editorial comments, and sometimes because of them.  The included DVD (I have the expanded edition) is fun to watch, and brings to \\"life\\" some of the examples discussed in print.

Maybe because I m not American , so the story background about Freemasons hardly appeals to me,but I love Robert Langdon's previous 2 novels , especially Angels and Demons , so I rushed out to buy this when it was out in the bookstores.My oh my , am I in for a disappointment .  The story was kinda bland , action far and apart and somehow you can't project yourself in the same situation as the characters .It seems so detached and preoccupied.The history part was not emphasized enough , therefore people in other countries or have little or no knowledge of the Freemasons will be left scratching their heads about what's all the fuss about . The beauty of both Da Vinci Code and Angels and Demons is that Brown spent a lot of time explaining about the vast history and its importance . Here , it is extremely lacking .

1400052173|3.0|I'm a big fan of science and medical non-fiction, so when I saw the rave reviews for The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks, I was excited to read it.  It started off strong; I'd give the first half five stars.  The oral history of the Lacks family was fascinating, and I loved reading about how the cells got their start in the lab.  When the author introduced the adult family (Deborah, et al), I felt a strong sympathy for them and what they'd been through.  I was already recommending it to friends, anticipating that the second half would be as good.      However, once I got to the second half, it went downhill considerably.  The writing was fairly tight in the beginning, keeping all of the stories woven together in a comprehensible way, but seemed to unravel as the book went on.  When I read the introduction, I didn't understand why Skloot was so defensive about inserting herself into the book (in my experience, medical non-fiction authors do it all the time), but I soon realized why - because by the second half, the book becomes less about HeLa, science, history, and ethics, and instead turns exclusively into a memoir about Skloot's dealings with the family.  And at this point, the family became unsympathetic and insufferable.  The writing became repetitive, somewhat informal, and ridden with unnecessary details.  One reviewer called this book \\"deftly written\\" and I'd have to disagree.  The second half gets one star.      The book ended on a strong note, with the Afterward.  The Afterward took us back to questions of bioethics.  As I was reading it, I wondered why the Afterward was a separate part - couldn't it have been woven into the second half of the book?      In short, I thought this book was merely ok, but as the reviews show, a lot of people loved it.  If you think that you're one of the people who will love it, read it.  If you're looking for a book that's just outstanding, look somewhere else.

B003IDFLQO|3.0|I got wrong product.  I wanted a cd. To return it cost more than the wrong shipment.
B002KSPKRS|5.0|1st of all, the ratio of good reviews to bad ones(as of the time I'm writing this) is roughly 5:1 in favor of the product. I live in a condo and even though I paid to have it sound-proofed, it  still won't cover up the $4000 Paradigm surround sound system I wanted to purchase. That being the case, I finally(after friends raved about these) broke down and \\"settled\\"(or so I thought) for these. After all, Amazon had them for $50 bucks less than everyone else right? I was afraid there'd be problems w/ the wireless situation due to some of the bad reviews. I have it right next to my Apple Time Capsule wireless-N router and have had NO PROBLEMS WHATSOEVER. I've even had my laptop open and on the net right next to me while I'm playing w/o a hitch. I also have a microwave and cordless phone(5.8ghz) within 30' of it. I've tested it for several hours now and it works flawlessly. No static, popping, or echos, etc. It's a little unforgiving performance-wise when batteries get low(not just on the headset, when the 360's controller batteries got low as well). When the batteries on some things get low you can usually \\"squeeze\\" a little more time out of them. Not these. Your game controller must have FULL batteries or you'll get a little static(nothing to do w/ your wireless network of course). Most (NOT ALL)of the people having problems w/ these have inherent problems w/ their wireless networks already anyway. Some people just have problems w/ wireless networks at their residence for various reasons(too many computers hooked up to their wireless network w/ too slow internet speeds, other products like cordless phones, microwaves, etc. causing interference). It does say in the instructions if you have a wireless N router to switch it off N to a different band, but I didn't have to do anything. The best feature this product has is the distinct volume controls. You have the game volume and a separate one for chat. It also has a chat boost which AUTOMATICALLY raises the chat volume when the game volume raises(explosions, etc.)! You have to adjust nothing. The best way to set this is turn the game volume all the way down AT FIRST ONLY, then raise the chat volume to your preferred setting. Slowly turn the game volume back up to your desired setting and you're set. The surround dynamics have accurate sound placement and are crystal clear. It will(probably) improve your kill/death ratio a little on games like Modern Warfare 2. I play strictly hardcore team deathmatch, and I my k/d ratio was stuck on 1.57 forever. 2 days w/ the X41's, and I'm up to 1.60 already!

0439023483|4.0|When sixteen year old Katniss takes her sister's place in the Reaping, she expects certain death. No one from District Twelve has ever won the Hunger Games, and Katniss doesn't believe she will be the exception.     Right off the bat the book introduces a dark premise. (SPOILER) When they first introduced Katniss and Gale I assumed they would participate in the Hunger Games together, and Gale would ultimately die in the end. This would have been much better than watching Katniss and Peeta cuddle up in a sleeping bag. Literally, at least twenty pages is devoted to them snuggling and wooing each other. I wouldn't have minded, except that I am stubborn and don't like Peeta. He was stupid and annoying and weak, and Gale is far more superior. (End spoiler)    But other than that, I really enjoyed the book. I appreciated that Collins didn't patronize her reader; The Hunger Games is a young adult book but the writing style makes it appealing to adults as well. I thought the action in the book created suspense, and overall it was an appealing read. (I really liked Rue!) If you're looking for action, good writing, and a decent plot, the Hunger Games delivers.
B002SJIO5E|5.0|At first, the plot and characters in this movie seem quite bizarre, but it eventually becomes apparent that the movie is clearly and faithfully illustrating a theme which is natural to the human condition.  That theme revolves around what happens when a minority group lives in the midst of a majority group, with the division into different and opposing groups being established based on their differences in ancestry, appearance, language, diet, and other cultural traits.<br /><br />In such a situation, the majority group may grow to detest the minority group and unjustly blame them for many of their own troubles, and they may even be tempted to exterminate the minority group (ie, genocide), but their instincts will usually tell them that that's going too far.  Instead, the minority group will usually be allowed to continue to exist, but they'll be geographically cordoned off and their rights will be limited, so that they suffer deprived circumstances, including epithets, physical abuse, poverty, exploitation, and crime.<br /><br />Again, the movie illustrates this (important) theme well, and in a way that there's no question about who the minority group is and the ways in which they're being mistreated.  I found the movie gripping, and I suspect that I'll remember it for a long time.<br /><br />If I have to come up with a negative criticism of the movie, I would say that perhaps some of the violence is over the top, and I wonder if it was necessary to include Nigerians among the really bad guys (given that their reputation is already bad enough).<br /><br />Nevertheless, I do recommend this movie.  It's much better than I expected, and it does its job well enough to warrant a full 5 stars.
B000L3CHC0|5.0|The first Swiss watch I bought with my own hard earned money. GREAT value for price, looks and function. Seriously, if you want a watch thats accurate to a couple of seconds to the hour (it will lag by 1/100ths of a second every 10-12 days) this is the watch you want! Savvy shipped it soon enough and I received it brand new (for those doubting the authenticity of the online watch orders..it IS authentic!) You will not find the warranty card stamped however, and would need to go through Savvy for repairs etc. as covered by the warranty period. PROS: looks great. Functions well and you cant go wrong with a watch like this ( I have researched long and kinda know my watches well..) CONS: Not 'on the dot' accurate. And buying this online limits the folks who would want to 'touch' the watch for..well anything, even reducing the no. of links for eg. But, overall I appreciate Savvy for their promptness and I would encourage you to purchase from them for sure (not had issues with the item yet touch-wood...but I see their customer ratings good in the repairs/returns department).   Summary: If you want to get started with buying and collecting good watches (i.e. like me) start with this one!

SILLY JACK KEROUAC.    He should have secured a $200,000 book advance from his publisher, jetted to Italy, India, and then Bali and after getting his book on the New York Times Bestseller list, he could've sold the movie rights for millions more.    And then advised everybody to do the same to find \\"happiness\\".    Well, that is, everybody who is an attractive white thirtysomething American with $200,000 in pocket money.    Oh, and the writing style reminds me of a teenage girl's diary, about as deep as a wading pool after a fat kid has cannonballed in it.

B000N3T0DW|4.0|Both touching and absurdly comic, as is much of  Almodovar's work. The film is a paean to women's strength, like a more mature. complex `Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown'. Full of wonderful images, moments and plot twists, from a murdered good-for nothing husband who must be disposed of, to a long dead mother who returns as a ghost to explain the past.  Or maybe she's not quite dead.  Full of fun scenes, and terrific performances.<br /><br />But - for me - something gets a little lost in the last 20 minutes - plot elements that need to be explained never are, while things I didn't really care about, or liked the unsolved mystery of, are explained in great, literal detail that somehow lessens the impact.  None-the-less, yet another imaginative, creative, funny and thoughtful film by Almodovar.
0894803123|5.0|Following the instructions carefully (just like prior reviews) results in the best ice cream I've ever had.  I shared with family and friends and everyone agrees it's better than store bought by far.  The book was published in 1987, but I guess a good recipe is timeless.
B000T2OMX0|4.0|I just purchased this recording of Bach's Cello Suites.  At the same time I bought Steven Isserlis, and also Fournier.  Prior to this I had Rostropovich and Casals.      This performance, with its mindfulness of the dance rhythms, is a more lyrical performance.  He seems to me to use more glissando in his phrasing, or I notice it, anyway.  In some ways, I prefer Isserlis to all the rest, but Queyras is growing on me.  I listen more to these two(Isserlis and Queyras) than the others that I have.     It strikes me that Queyras was more closely miked than Isserlis, and this seeme to me to add to the impression of immediacy, makes you feel that you are more closely there, in a smaller more private room.  Whether I am right about this, someone who knows would have to comment.       Casals did much to place forward the cello,  however,  he seems more melancholic to me.  Perhaps Casals did not feel that way, and I am mistaken.     We are fortunate to have a wide selection of performances to listen to.  I would like to hear the interpretations of earlier cellist Emmanuel Feuermann, perhaps Jacqueline du Pre, who is supposed to embroider and ornament Bach(you mean like musicians did in the Baroque times?  Goodness, what are we coming to? ).  Slightly less old is Nathaniel Rosen's recording, which seems to be released again.  In the present day two others I would like to hear are Ophelie Gaillard and Zuill Bailey.
B0036TGSR6|1.0|Robert Harris book, the Ghost, is excellent. It is a pure thriller and well worth the read.  Yet this movie is tainted by the actions of the Director.  You can not buy this movie without contributing to a un-repentant and un-punished child rapist. Therefore this work can not viewed without the lens of what you are supporting. Just as you shouldn't buy conflict diamonds, I would argue you shouldn't buy \\"conflict movies\\"  Skip this one, borrow it from a friend, or torrent it.  Buy the book, if you want the story.

B0008KLVG4|5.0|this was such a good movie Spielberg did a great job with it this is the best jaws movie in the franchise. Where do i start this movie had a really interesting, suspenseful plot that scared allot of people [including me] into staying out of the ocean. The shark looks kinda fake but i don't really care it must be pretty hard to make a 25 foot long model of a shark look real [especially since this was made in the 70s]. In some ways i recommend the 30th anniversary widescreen edition rather than the fullscreen anniversary collectors edition because the bonus features in the 30th anniversary widescreen edition are longer. jaws grossed $470,653,000 which shows why this is probably the best shark movie get it.  jaws:10/10 awesome  jaws2:8/10 pretty good  jaws3:4/10 bad  jaws the revenge:1/10 waste of money
B0036TGSR6|2.0|Wow, in a million years I would have never guessed this plot. Let's see, Roman Polanski, the rapist, (or was it really rape rape, better consult Whoopie ), directs a movie about Tony Blair and President Bush. And much to my surprise, guess what? Bush is stupid, Blair is a puppet of the US, and the CIA is evil. Never saw that one coming. And the really odd thing, no mention of all the deaths, rape and torture caused by terrorist, oh I'm sorry, man made disasters. The only redeeming line was by Blair, take two planes, one taking all measures to insure safety, and one where security is performed in a perfunctory manner. Which one would you put your children on?
0061544493|5.0|This book is a very lively read complete with anecdotes and pictures. If you are looking for ideas in classic style tips this is the book for you. I would veer from most of the shops and brands she specifically refers too, because you can find good quality for a bit less money elsewhere. One of her main mantras is quality over quantity. This is a great point, it is much better to have one expensive pair of jeans that accentuate you in the right places and make you feel good than it is to have ten pairs of jeans that make you feel blah. Grab this book and learn from it; you will have a great time doing so.
0307454541|4.0|When I first started reading this book I thought \\"Uh oh.  A lot of hype for nothing.\\" The pace was a bit slow in the beginning but then all of a sudden I found myself very interested to know more about Blomkvist and especially Lisbeth Salander.  A very unusual, anti-heroic protagonist, Salander is truly unique and once I finished the book I found the hype pretty well-justified. Honestly, the mystery part of it is not so ground-breaking but Lisbeth Salander is so I will definitely continue with the rest of the series.
0307278255|4.0|Lahiri's prose is beautiful and she has a way of painting pictures with words that is rarely seen in literature today. The one negative thing that I would say is that all of her short stories seem to be about the same thing so that after reading one or two, you start to think that you have read them all. I recall being quite bored by the third story, but part II of the collection saved the book for me. The intertwining of stories and characters in part II made for a beautiful story and one that sticks with you.
B0006GAI6Y|5.0|This movie takes a serious but fun-loving look at how we sometimes get caught up in the \\"rut\\" of life, missing out on those things that intrigue us or lost desires. Each character finds what really makes them smile on the inside through the art of Ballroom Dancing. Richard Gere, Jennifer Lopez, and Susan Sarandon give, as always, outstanding performances.

B003J27WFW|5.0|This was a extremely well made \\"rockumentary\\". The history lessons and road stories are informative and inspirational. It looks at how three of the most talented musicians on the planet operate. How they coexist, and feed off of each other, and after this many years continue to challenge each other. Far surpassing \\"a band\\" and becoming a family. A wonderful story. You will laugh (a lot), you will cry (probably just once), you will save five bucks (?????), it's better than CATS you'll watch it again and again!
0140120416|5.0|I am not very good at learning foreign languages but have to do some of it for my job.  For me, the key to learning is to stay interested enough to be able to continue practicing regularly. Each chapter here builds on the previous one just enough to make me feel like I am learning and making progress with each lesson. I also enjoy how the dialogues show easy to use and understand examples of the points introduced in each chapter. It is also nice to see how exceptions to the rules are introduced and demonstrated in a relatively painless fashion. If you are looking for serious grammar and vocabulary help in a fairly straightforward format, by all means give this course a try. I have made many half hearted attempts over the years to learn Russian using several cassette and workbook type courses, but I lost interest in them quickly. After taking a brief two month intensive classroom course, I found this book and decided to give it a try based on other good reviews. I am very glad I did. Perhaps because the chapters are organized in a manner similar to the language textbooks I remember from school, I found this book easy to follow and very suited to my own personal learning style. The sections in each chapter are short, and I have found that I can do one or two sections each night without being overwhelmed. Vocabulary lists at the beginning of each chapter are useful for vocabulary building. Noun declension and inflected endings were the most difficult concepts for me to grasp in the classroom, but thanks to the straightforward manner in which they are presented in this book, I am quickly coming to terms with not only how they work but also when and how to use them properly. That being said, I agree with other reviewers who mention the need to hear the spoken language in order to acquire proper pronunciation, but there are resources out there online that can be downloaded, not to mention Russian language movies available even on the rental scene.
B003ITZBVS|3.0|I was shocked that the creators didn't hold back and showed the Joker beating Robin to death in the first scenes. ....other similar scenes make this DVD absolutely not for kids.     Cons: I was a bit disappointed in that unlike the movie \\"Superman/Batman, Public Enemies\\" that followed the story arc faithfully, used Conroy's voice, and based the artwork on artist's Ed McGuinness this story didn't.  I was looking forward to how they were to interpret the artist's Doug Mahnke's work and show some of my favorite's scenes from the trade. One scene from the book was Batman's quest for understanding how people come back to life after death from his friends, Zatanna, Superman, and Green Arrow .... classic Batman interaction. At one and 15 minutes long...they could have added some of these classic moments.    Pro: Pretend you never read Batmam, Under the Red Hood and this is a great movie. Brings all the pieces together of Jason's death and his comeback as the Red Hood.  The last scenes where Batman remembers the first day of Jason as Robin is heart-breaking.   The action scenes, the battle scenes, and the chase scenes are fantastic. They took a page from Batman, Gotham Knight DVD and brought Gotham to life..the lighting ...the shadows of the city, all enhance the story.
0307456625|3.0|~<br />This novel has been on my reading list for a long time, and I was excited to finally have the time to read, The No.1 Ladies Detective Agency. I wanted to like it, however...I didn't, not really.  Yes, it was charming enough, in a cute way, but nothing about it grabbed a hold of me, and motivated me to keep reading.  It was mostly a series of short stories about Mma Ramotswe, a women living in Africa who owns her own detective agency. Most chapters consisted of a different client with a mystery to solve, and ended with Mma Ramotswe cleverly figuring it all out. None of the chapters relate to each other, and I didn't think the individual cases were at all exciting or interesting. However, I did finish it, and it wasn't horrible, so I'm giving it 2 ½ stars.
B003INBOEM|1.0|Such a Excellent movie for a Wing Chun practioner, purchased the blu-ray collectors edition and it would not play on the player, requested an exchange and the 2nd one would not play. The blu ray version is made on cheap disks and you can see the defects on the disk itself.    AVOID THE BLU-RAY VERSION, will try the DVD and see if that has problems. The rating is not for the film but the media it is produced on, I give the film a 10 out of 5 stars!
0525423842|1.0|I was excited to learn that Grisham wrote a book for pre-teen readers. After an early negative experience, I now read all the books I give to my 10 yr old grandson, an avid reader. I could hardly wait to read this one before sending it on to him. However, I found this book not only boring but unsuitable in subject matter for a 10 yr old.     Theo comes off as unrealistically good and smart. None of his friends could possibly measure up. In addition, there's much discussion about other parents and the difficulties of abuse and divorce that are not appropriate. Too bad Grisham didn't exercise his talent in writing intriguing mysteries with characters you care about in this book.
B002VPE1XY|4.0|We got this case for a [[ASIN:B0011EA9FA Sony Cybershot DSCW120]]. It fits the camera perfectly and affords it an acceptable level of protection. The case is fairly well made but \\"leather\\" is of the light variety and looks as though it would start to wear out in a year or two. But who knows, perhaps it will hold up. So far, so good. It will certainly protect a camera from scratches and give ample padding for normal wear and tear, but it is not overly padded for drops from any great height. If it fell on it's edge the ribbed style would help protect it, but if it fell flat I don't think it would offer more than the most modest impact protection.<br /><br />It is an attractive case -- understated and not flashy. It isn't a high end case, but for the price you can't complain. The interior is covered with a suede-like lining and it even has a pocket for a spare memory card. The magnetic latch closes it securely and the velcro clasp secures easily to all but the widest belts. There is a hole at the top in case you want to run your wrist strap through it, but I found that feature unnecessary and it exposes the camera to the elements more than it should.  Otherwise it is a good design and one I would recommend purchasing at this price point.

B003LXM1RS|4.0|more electronic and less acoustic, the Sisters 4th album is slick and catchy. Two songs are a dissapointment but the rest is pretty golden. A must have for fans and a great intro for newbies. The Scissor Sisters are back with a slighly less edgy sound but it still is great listening
B002VECLVO|2.0|This film is very stylish with some gorgeous scenes and flashes of brilliance, but that will only carry you so far before boredom sets in. I think the editor needs a serious talking to -- all those scenes of naked bodies floating in water set to violin music may have seemed interesting at the time, but I was leaping for the fast-forward button on a regular basis.  [WARNING, POTENTIAL MINOR SPOILER] At the beginning of the film the bereaved Mr. Firth is informed that one of his dogs was found dead at the scene along with his lover, but the issue of what happened to the second dog is a total loose end that never comes up again. Laugh if you will, but the character, who is obviously very affected by the love for and memory of his dogs, would have made an effort to find that missing dog who was the last link to his dead lover.  I don't know if this was a flaw in the novel or the film, but it deeply irked me.
0545128285|1.0|Ok, the book was really good and I was happy. I mean, they are children's stories. I, however, was not happy with the condition of my book when I recieved it. The first 30 pages were water damaged, there was sharpie on the cover, someone had written in purple pen on top of the pages with unnecessary remarks, and the last page of the binding was ripped. I got this for my friend on her birthday, which is today. We were both very dissapointed. A girl only turns 15 once, especially when she has cancer. She may not have many more birthdays so this one was really special to her. Thanks for ruining it Snow Lion Books.
B003LAH7MU|4.0|Symphonicities easily gets four stars from me. The July 15 review by R. Mathes and the July 20 review by Gregory Wilson persuaded me to make the purchase. The recording carefully avoids the overproduction of many failed attempts at integrating rock music into orchestral interpretations, a list that began with Deep Purple in the Seventies, Metallica a few years ago, and numerous Beatles efforts. The Sting compositions lend themselves well to the renditions here and the craftsmanship and skill of everyone involved is very apparent to me. Sting's voice sounds great providing a newly gleaned melody and nuance' to the songs. Familiar lyrics are refreshed in a most positive way. Listening, I envision the music forming the core of a serious and excellent Broadway play. I am sad that many Sting/Police fans are disappointed with this album. I believe the effort and care that went into Symphonicities provides a very satisfying result. On high end headphones the aural experience is sublime.
B0012GMW0C|5.0|This is their first and best release. The opening track to this cd is probably the best song they have ever recorded.
B003OF3R0S|5.0|Nightmare sounds like what Avenged Sevenfold wanted their self-titled release to sound like.  That disc ended up full of throw-away tracks from City of Evil and sounding like the band had gone on vacation and let their producers write most of the songs for them.  The band didn't sound bad but the song writing was uninspired and strikingly repetitive.<br /><br />Here, the band has assembled a much stronger set of work and their effort shows.  Many of the bands fans are, understandably, still emotional over the death of the band's drummer.  However, Nightmare is an outstanding album worthy of praise for the music it contains, no sympathetic tear jerking commentary necessary.  This is a damn good disc.  As someone who truly believes the Rev was one of the best drummers in rock history, especially when it came to writing drum tracks that fit a song perfectly, Mike Portnoy is indisputably one of the great drummers in rock and metal history and he stays so true to the Rev's unique style that the quality of the songs is not diminished in any way.<br /><br />Rather than give a novel-length recounting of each individual song's merits I will simply say that perhaps the most impressive thing about Nightmare is the focus with which each song was crafted.  Each track leaves the genuine impression that the band made that the very best song it could be, and exactly the song they wanted it to be without the obvious concern for radio friendliness or fan appeal that was so prevalent on their last album. No song here disappoints, and none becomes weaker with repeated listens.<br /><br />I am not a person who fits in with most of Avenged Sevenfold's fan base, but I am a person who appreciates great music and this is it.  After repeated listenings I fully expect to enjoy Nightmare just as much as City of Evil and Waking the Fallen for years to come.
B003JLA4KS|4.0|If you're a fan, and basically grew up with RUSH, this is a great documentary that shows the inner-workings and creation of the band, a future R-n-R Hall of Fame contender. They have withstood the critical test of time, and maintained a core audience throughout. Good library disc!
B0036EH3XE|4.0|I've been a devotee of Lost since its inception in 2004.  When looking at the series as a whole, Season 6 was, indeed, satisfactory.  There were a couple of stenchous episodes (\\"Across the Sea,\\" for one -- too little, too late), but I wept through the entire series finale.  For one thing, Michael Giaccino's music hit the nail on the head.  Imposing, yet poignant, foreshadowing yet beautiful.  I cried for days afterwards because what was important not only about the final season, but the series finale, was how far every character had come (except for Kate.  The writers did NOT do that character justice).  The flashes-sideways of what might have been had the plane never crashed were touching and meaningful, and by the end IT DIDN'T MATTER that every question wasn't answered.  The IMPORTANT one was.  (Funny how we hope for answers on T.V. and in books when we can't get them in life.  Why should they be any different?)  All told, I'm glad this series had a finale that would NOT allow for any follow-up series or movies.  Anything other than the ending presented would have degraded an original, imaginative, character-driven work that will go down as one of the most provocative endeavors in entertainment history.

B002ZG97RE|1.0|Great action flick. I enjoyed the sequences, the acting, and the flow of the story. Where this film fails is it takes actual events and persons and re-creates them into a ficticious distortion of actual history. Where it fails for me is in presenting a very believable account that misleads the viewer about actual events. It could be a masterpiece but instead the story is a pathetic political diatribe chock full of politically motivated historical fiction.<br />If you are as predisposed to incriminating the Bush Admin as are the makers of this film you will love it because it will confirm all of your naive expectations.. Only one problem: is it is fiction.<br />Tell the surviving members of Kurdish families who were victims of saddam's WMD genocide massacre that the WMD's never existed. You say Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld fabricated the lie to justify the invasion. The historical fact is that the intel came from many international sources and a bipartisan congress examined the international intel and declared war. The president did not bypass the UN and congress. This is an inconvenient truth so a ficticious \\"Magellan\\" is fabricated to mislead the viewer.
030726999X|5.0|We are told that The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest completes the trilogy of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo and The Girl Who Played with Fire. However, there are rumors that before he died author Stieg Larsson had begun work on yet another book that is being edited for publication. Millions of readers the world over are fervently hoping that this is true. The books are fantastic.  Lisbeth Salander is definitely an original and intriguing character who is a brave misfit. The story opens with her critically wounded and in an intensive care unit of a hospital in Sweden.  If she manages to survive, she will be arrested for multiple murders. Her friend and one time lover, Mikael Blomkvist, a journalist sets out to prove her innocence. In his quest, he uncovers a corrupt group within the government that is responsible for Salander's situation. She will need to confront this faction and the individuals who have accused and abused her.  She moves from being the victim in the first two books to fighting back and taking charge in the conclusion of The Hornet's Nest.  The fast moving plot twists and turns are powerful, imaginative and very compelling.  The characters are complex, including the likable, the despicable, and the weird, but they are believable. Larrson's descriptions are detailed to the point of allowing the reader to step into and envision the settings.  As the characters drank cup after cup of coffee, I found myself craving a latte. The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest is constantly and completely enthralling in its depth and uniqueness. You won't be able to put it down even when you are making a pot of coffee, as you step into the setting and join the characters. While the books can stand alone, I would highly recommend reading the complete trilogy from the beginning. They are all just too good to miss.

B000084T18|5.0|This album is severely underrated and I think it is definitely one of the best. People hate on 50 because his latest stuff has not been as good, but this album was untouchable back in the day. You could listen to it straight through with out skipping a track. It was all hot, and that is something that is not common with a lot of rap albums being put out today. This album was raw and the beats from dre were some of his best. This album has to be considered in the top 10 hip hop albums ever made. Its that good.
B000WDSZ8E|5.0|HIMYM (How I Met Your Mother) is a fun show about a group of friends and the the stuff that happens to them. The big creative point of the show is that it is narrated by the character Ted from the year 2030, and he is telling all these stories to his children. The over arching story is how Ted met his wife, or how Ted met the mother of his children. I get the vibe from the show, is that it is like \\"Friends\\" but the characters are cooler and funnier.

B002ZG99G8|5.0|The movie starts out with an elite undercover group (The Losers) operating in Bolivia. An air strike is called in to take out some drug dealers. The Losers espy children in the group being used as \\"mules.\\" They attempt to call off the strike, only to be foiled on the radio by a guy named \\"Max.\\" With 5 minutes left, they go in and do a rescue operation, saving the kids from the air strike. A helicopter comes down to pick them up, but can't transport both The Losers and the 25 kids so the The Losers give up their seats (Buddy Holly thanks you.) The Helicopter is shot down and all those kids are killed.<br /><br />The Losers realize they were the target and they toss their dog tags into the wreckage to make it look like they died. While living \\"undercover\\" in Bolivia they meet Zoe Saldana who tells them she can get them back home if they go kill Max for her. The movie contains some minor plot twists, but it is not complicated. The characters are convincing and likable. The acting was simply great. The dialogue was original, crisp, and witty. The soundtrack was great, but why does every movie which involves spooks (CIA) and Latin America plays \\"Black Betty?\\"<br /><br />Recap: Great movie. Action keeps moving. Great dialogue. Humor. Good characters. Really was nothing not to like. Zoe is hot too. It is on par with Basic.
B001I5M9SC|5.0|Musically - astounding; Videography - exceptional.  How could it be any better?

And what a GREAT movie.<br />First of all, it had me balling in the first 20 minutes, but the movie really carried itself well, without making it too long. Secondly, what I really liked about the movie, is that it did have a lot of adult themes in it (death of a spouse, divorce, neglectful parents, problems conceiving children), it was still great for kids.<br />Great story, and great movie :)

0143117564|5.0|a miraculously humorous, friendly, witty, creative and highly intelligent story that perfectly answers the inane complaint that Pynchon is \\"too difficult to get through.\\" I love his lengthy novels and consider them masterpieces. Each page is a wonder unto itself. To follow up the epic, encyclopedic magnitude of \\"Against The Day\\" with such a tight, concise, rollicking, and light-hearted psychedelic mystery story is another surprising stroke of genius from the man worthy of endless esteem and awe.<br /><br />This is energetic and delightful \\"summertime reading\\" that will quench your thirst for something fun and peppy while it surreptitiously expands your mind! The language is gorgeous, the plot twists intriguing, and the dynamic philosophical musings are little gems of cognitive candy that leave a lasting taste.<br /><br />This amazing book proves a thoroughly enriching and satisfying novel through-and-through.<br /><br />Long Live Thomas Pynchon, the reigning master of the game!
B000F4RHB6|5.0|Their early work was a little too new wave for my tastes, but when Sports came out in '83, I think they really came into their own, commercial and artistically. The whole album has a clear, crisp sound, and a new sheen of consummate professionalism that really gives the songs a big boost. He's been compared to Elvis Costello, but I think Huey has a far much more bitter, cynical sense of humour.
B002ZG995E|5.0|To many, \\"The A-Team\\" is just another in a long line of movies-made-from-TV-shows. But to me - and to those that grew up with the original like I did - this is a movie that you would hope to kick butt just as much as the TV show did. There were plenty of movies based on hit TV shows that failed miserably: [[ASIN:B001B7CNXI Miami Vice (Unrated Director's Edition) [Blu-ray]]], [[ASIN:B000F9RB94 S.W.A.T. [Blu-ray]]], [[ASIN:B000ASDFGI Bewitched (Special Edition)]], [[ASIN:B000BKJ758 The Dukes of Hazzard (Unrated Widescreen Edition)]], [[ASIN:B0024FA9IM Lost in Space [Blu-ray]]], [[ASIN:0792842227 The Mod Squad]], and [[ASIN:0790738511 The Avengers]]. Needless to say, I was nervous when I heard of 20th Century Fox's plans to remake the 1983 NBC hit show. Then, fortunately, I saw the movie trailer and all of my worries subsided as I saw the stellar cast of Liam Neeson (who is awesome in pretty much anything he does), Bradley Cooper, Sharlto Copley, Patrick Wilson, and Jessica Biel. I was worried about Quinton \\"Rampage\\" Jackson  who didn't have any real acting experience before this film and is mostly known for his title as Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) Light-Heavyweight Champion. However, upon Jackson's first 15 minutes on screen, my fears all disappeared. I was also a little worried about Copley's casting as \\"Mad\\" Murdock (that character being my favorite from the show), but he -- like Jackson -- took on the role and made it his own. He correctly captured all the genius, maddening humor that Dwight Schultz brought to the original.<br /><br />The first thing you should accept upon going into this film is that this is a fun, slam-bang action film. It's not to be taken too seriously but it's also not merely some silly popcorn flick that the studio put together merely for money and marketing. There's plenty of action and laughs but the story, acting and pacing are all up to par as well. I remember watching the television show when it originally aired and loved the setup of these rogue heroes helping a client in need every week (a popular formula that is most currently showcased in USA network's \\"Burn Notice\\"). Unlike most action shows of its day - and action shows on TV today - \\"The A-Team,\\" with all of its bullets and explosions, had an extremely low death toll (only five people died during the entire run of the series and none of the deaths were caused by the A-Team themselves). The show's brilliant plot twists, action sequences, and customized weapons (take that, \\"MacGyver\\"!) kept all of us diehard fans coming back for five seasons. And those same elements, which are plentiful in this update, charge our enthusiasm to see the film.<br /><br />As I previously stated, Liam Neeson rocks in pretty much anything - any genre, any movie! He does not disappoint in this. His cigar-chomping, \\"love-it-when-a-plan-comes-together\\" leader Hannibal Smith does complete justice to original portrayer George Peppard. And there's no better actor I could think of today to portray Face than Bradley Cooper. Most know him as a comedic actor with prominent roles in \\"Wedding Crashers\\" and \\"The Hangover.\\" But most don't know that he first appeared as a serious co-starring role in the J.J. Abrams/Jennifer Garner hit ABC series \\"Alias.\\" So the man is multi-faceted; even though he's hilarious and I enjoy and look forward to seeing him in more comedic roles, I also hope to see him in more serious roles in the near future.<br /><br />If you haven't seen, or are not familiar with, the original TV show, you should know that it follows closely to the original series albeit with a few modernized plot points for making the film as contemporary as possible. Yes, this film is directed more toward guys but, ladies, if your boyfriend/husband/male friend talks you into viewing this film, don't roll your eyes just yet. Like I said, the story is enjoyable and Jessica Biel's presence is more female action star rather than just a sex symbol for show. Patrick Wilson's Agent Lynch is fun and deadly, which Jason Patric tried to capture as Max in [[ASIN:B003OCWF6I The Losers [Blu-ray]]] -- a graphic novel-turned-movie that follows closely to The A-Team's premise -- but did not succeed. Director Joe Carnahan, who directed one of my favorite action flicks of all time, [[ASIN:B002VEJKQI Smokin' Aces [Blu-ray]]], does an excellent job with both the direction and screenplay. The film runs at about two hours and yet I left the movie satisfied. I felt like I could've watched at least another hour. And the way the film ends (with a super cameo from Mad Men's Jon Hamm), I yearn for a sequel. Although, even if there isn't one, I won't be too disappointed as the film stands strongly by itself. Even though it's still early, I'll say that, so far, \\"The A-Team\\" is the best action film of the summer!ly, which Jason Patric tried to capture as Max in [[ASIN:B003OCWF6I The Losers [Blu-ray]]] -- a graphic novel-turned-movie that follows closely to The A-Team's premise -- but did not succeed.

1423113381|2.0|I really should have stopped reading when the baboon with the basketball Jersey appeared.  On first read Red Pyramid is more than disappointing.  I was eagerly expecting a new kind of story that empowered everyone involved and not incidentally told a great unbelievable tale.  Instead the older sibling who actually knows all about Egyptian history turns out to be useful mainly for grunt work and even gets a fairly cruel twist on his underage romance-like thing, while the sibling who knows very little turns out to be an incredibly powerful natural, mature enough to make impossible life and death decisions and gets her own little Twilight going.  Who is the mysterious traitor?  Let me put it this way.  Be prepared to say \\"Aww man.\\"   Fantastic ideas, apparently great intentions, but in the end the same old story.
B00002ZMNV|5.0|Even if one is not a Metallica fan, the power and rage of Metallica and their music is undeniable. The San Francisco Symphony, with Michael Kamen as the conductor, is regarded as one of the best orchestras in the world.  One would think that these musicians are disparities and would never cross path. \\"How can a thrash metal band sound remotely decent with an orchestra?\\" One would ask. Well, Metallica, Michael Kamen, and the San Francisco Symphony orchestra did it; and it was a masterpiece.    From the second Metallica walked onto the stage, the mutual respect between these true musicians was evident. Opening with The Ecstasy of Gold, drifting to The Call of Ktulu, then to the wrathful Master of Puppets, everyone in the stadium was ecstatic. The unexpected harmony was largely due to the conductor, Michael Kamen. The orchestra definitely volumed up, to the classic songs of Metallica (such as Of Wolf and Man and Devil's Dance).    Two of my favorites that I found to be especially dark and heavy were - Human and One. In my opinion, I think the music of Metallica and the Symphony blended perfectly in these two songs. All the audience were standing from their seats while the band and the Orchestra were making their music. Dark, raw, and astonishing......    S & M is a masterpiece.

0307265730|5.0|To be brutally honest, short stories are a genre I usually avoid.  I find myself frustrated with having to start and stop the story and my (usual) inability to get into the flow and inhabit the fictional world.  When it comes to Jhumpa Lahiri, none of the above holds true and I will read anything she writes, in any genre.  This collection of eight short stories is just as fabulous as \\"Interpreter of Maladies\\" and her full-length novel \\"The Namesake\\".  Three books, three knockout winners in my opinion.<br /><br />The first five stories are independent of each other and the final three are interwoven with the characters.  Each story typically runs 40 pages so there is enough time to fully develop these characters and she does it so well.  Telling the stories of second generation Bengalis, Ms. Lahiri explores all aspects of being immigrants and the children of immigrants but particularly shines as it relates to the conflict between the parents looking back to India and the children looking forward to the United States.  Each story is an absolute jewel that creates a world where the reader can enter, enjoy and then exit all within the span of relatively few pages.  Very few authors can do this to my satisfaction and she is the best I have found.<br /><br />Outstanding book and incredibly talented author overall.
B002ZG977Y|1.0|I don't normally write reviews for things, but this was just so terribly distracting.  The only reason why it gets even one star is because of the special effects.  The detail of the pegasus (even though they came from the beheading of Medusa...) was amazing, the soundtrack was pretty good as well.  Ironically enough I had watched a few episodes of ROME just hours before, and when I saw the costuming in this movie, I found how terribly artificial and inaccurate it was.  If you're going to spend that much money on special effects, you might as well do a good job on the wardrobe.  What the hell was Io doing in this movie?  Where's Athena?  And all the stuff Perseus gets from Hermes?  As soon as the inaccuracies in the mythologies started piling up, I was very distracted.  I couldn't get into it.  I really, really wanted Io to be gone, but she kept on appearing like a bad penny.  I wanted the grey-eyed goddess!  And the Djinn?  Isn't that from middle eastern mythology?  And Djinn were mischievous Genies.  Where did they get the idea for their character design?!  What were they smoking when they decided to put them in this movie?  If you want a more accurate depiction of Perseus, go for Lightening Thief because at least he has the flying shoes.
B003ITZBW2|5.0|As a long time fan of the Batman mythos, the story of the second Robin has been one that's lingered with me for ages.  \\"Under The Red Hood\\" does a fantastic job at exploring Jason's death and his rebirth.   The movie is beautifully animated, the acting is superb, and the tone is gritty, dark, and haunting - exactly what I'd hope for in a story such as this.      I love that there is very little true good and true evil.  It's very easy to see shades of the three members of the Bat family in each other - elements of Dick's lighthearted attitude return in dark reprise in Red Hood's lines, just as likewise we can see hints of Red Hood's ruthlessness in his former mentor.  And the complexity isn't just with our heros:  Jason Issacs as Ra's al Ghul is a delightfully conflicted character despite being nominally on the villain side of the house, and the political interweaving between Red Hood, the Joker, and Black Mask is honestly fun to watch.      If there is anything I'd have wished for more of in this story, it would be an exploration of the connection between Nightwing and Red Hood.  I'd have liked to see more about the similarities in differences between these two sons, both of whom left home for very different reasons - and returned in equally different means.  Sadly, Nightwing is phased out relatively early in the story which is a real shame for a fan like me who enjoys the relationship between Nightwing and Batman - and Nightwing's running commentary on Batman's methods - just as much as that between Batman and Red Hood.  The movie feels like it runs a bit short to me, so there could easily have been some extra time spent in this area.  The movie also suffers from a lack of Tim Drake, which is equally unfortunate but perhaps understandable in the interest of simplicity.    All in all, \\"Under The Red Hood\\" is an action packed romp with some truly delightful twists and turns.  It's grim and dark, but there's a delicate thread of hope and humor running throughout it.It's a definite must for anyone who enjoys the Batman mythos or even just fans of solid animation and action stories in general.  As I'm a fall of all three, it's a perfect win for me.
B000FS9FC6|5.0|This is not a movie for the faint-of-heart. It reaches down into the very root of the modern political warmaking machine and totally debunks the War on Terror (TM) (copyright) with all its sloganeering and xenophobia. I'm not sure the latter was intended by the movie's producers... it looks more like an attempt to analyze the mindset of hyperambitious politician-types. Nevertheless, the larger message becomes hard to avoid as the movie unfolds because it mirrors our government's actions post-911.<br /><br />If you're into feelgood fairytales, this is clearly not the movie for you.
B002KSPKRS|4.0|I have been using these headsets for about 6 months now, and I use them EVERY DAY!  Not only for playing games on the Xbox360, but for what ever else I can plug into them, stereo, TV, computer... etc.  I work on board a ship, and we have thin walls between the staterooms, using these headphones allows me to crank up what ever I am listening to without disturbing the crew members in the adjoining state rooms.  AND I have the freedom of being wireless, and to me that is priceless.    I do have one small complaint though, the plug for the wire that connects headset to xbox360 controller is rather cheaply made.  When I first opened them, and plugged in the cord so that I could chat with game friends, I got a lot of loud popping in my ears.  I discovered that it was the connection between the cord and the jack on the side of the headphones.  Not wanting to send them back, and knowing a little bit about electronics I opened up the headset and was able to tweak the mic jack so that it made a better connection.  I still get the occasional popping sound, but I am able to live with it.    Over all I love them, but they could use a much better jack for the mic connections, especially for the price that they are asking.  If I was in the market to buy another set of wireless gaming headphones, I would definitely buy these again.
B003EV6DBW|4.0|Doctor Who is quite possibly the best series I have ever seen. Bringing the Doctor back in 2005 was pure genius.  On to Season 5. Matt Smith is by far a great actor, and he does extremely well, but the chemistry one felt from Eccleston and Tennant is somewhat missing. I never grew to care as much for the new Doctor as I had the previous incarnations. That being said, Matt Smith had huge shoes to fill and he will hopefully grow to fill them.   Matt Smith is given some great dialogue. Amy, his new companion, is actually brilliant in her role. Smith is quirky, and he brings in elements from previous doctors. Rory is superb and often balances the other two characters strong personalities.  I liked the story arc that lasted the entire season, where there is a crack in Amy's wall and there is something just a bit off. For those of you who know the Doctor, that crack just might lead to the end of the world. With Moffat's strong writing, we again see the weeping angels, explore the time of Van Gogh, and find Vampires in Venice!  The reason I give this series 4 stars instead of five is I feel some depth has been lost from Tennant, the 10th Doctor, to Matt Smith. Thankfully, Smith improves by each episode, and this goes into the next season as well.  Completely updated 9/2011

B001AQTWF2|3.0|July 31st, 2010<br /><br />I'm gonna rate this like I rated John Mayer's new album.<br /><br />KEY<br />-------------------------------------<br />\\"PLUS\\" = Good<br />\\"OKAY\\" = Not bad, but could be better<br />\\"NEGATIVE\\" = Needs a lot of work<br /><br />This is my first time listening to all of the songs together.<br /><br />OK. Here goes.<br /><br />MILLION DOLLAR BILL: This song reminds me of a gay anthem or something. Especially the \\"ooooooooooooooh\\" vocals. It's not excellent, but for modern Whitney, I'll take it. Co-written by Alicia Keys and Swizz Beatz, it shows Whitney having a good time. \\"PLUS\\"<br /><br />NOTHIN' BUT LOVE: This song isn't that great. The \\"Nothin' But Love\\"'s in the background sound really dumb and just tacked on in the chorus. Not much else to say but this is a true skipper. \\"NEGATIVE\\"<br /><br />CALL YOU TONIGHT: This song has Whitney holding back a little and I actually like it. It's really relaxing and calm. I like the chorus and the simple  guitar. \\"PLUS\\"<br /><br />I LOOK TO YOU: A ballad written solely by R.Kelly, Whitney sets out to inspire. \\"OKAY\\"<br /><br />LIKE I NEVER LEFT: Co-written by Whitney (finally, she's writing lyrics!) this is actually the first song we heard from the album properly. I wasn't crazy about it at first but it's passable. I really hate to say it (because I can't stand him) but Akon compliments Whitney's sound in this song. \\"OKAY\\"<br /><br />A SONG FOR YOU: Um...first of all, she shouldn't have covered this. Her voice just doesn't fit the song. Second, why is this a dance effort? I really like the ending note though. \\"OKAY\\"<br /><br />I DIDN'T KNOW MY OWN STRENGTH: A really overblown ballad written by the one and only Diane Warren. Her songs are usually hit or miss and this one? Well...it's boring. \\"NEGATIVE\\"<br /><br />WORTH IT: I honestly wasn't sure about this song before when I first heard it. But it's good. In fact, I would go as far as saying this is tied for best song on the album with 'CALL YOU TONIGHT'. \\"PLUS\\"<br /><br />FOR THE LOVERS: I felt nothing really, listening to this song. It's a club song of sorts, but doesn't do anything for me. \\"NEGATIVE\\"<br /><br />I GOT YOU: Besides the spanish guitar, the production (which was done by Akon) although not bad, is totally not Whitney. It's kinda got a space-like vibe. I don't love this song but it's... \\"OKAY\\"<br /><br />SALUTE: The only thing I really love about this song is the piano part. That's it. Other than that, this song is a bust too. Sorry, Whit. \\"NEGATIVE\\"<br /><br />Well, with only 11 tracks on the album, I hope at least you sort of lost yourself in my review and enjoyed it. I was being honest even as a Whitney fan. Her voice has changed drastically and I bet you all could tell that by her singles.

1416550542|4.0|There's a lot of hoopla about this book, and it's perfectly readable, even if its somewhat boring in the beginning.  I liked House at Riverton well enough, but didn't love it, and that's how I feel about this book.  There's a feeling of screenplay about her story telling that, until the end, made me want to give the book three stars.  The structure of the story is decent, the mystery is no mystery, at least to me because I knew who the mother was all along, I guessed the father just after he was introduced and I am usually the last person to solve any kind of mystery!  This book for me suffered in comparison to the exceptional Ghost Writer which I had just finished.  THe stories are similar, a young person researching the past, a past involving an author and lots of family secrets, there's even the use of xrays (or misuse, in both cases) in the early 20th century as an important element of the story.  The last chapters and the epilogue showed enough feeling for me to raise the rating.  I guess overall, if you don't expect much, and you don't have the Ghost Writer (which I highly recommend) to read instead, this is a decent read.

It takes place mostly in Sweden, although it also involves Eastern Europe and Australia.<br /><br />In this novel, Lisbeth Salander is an operative for Milton Security.  She is very introverted, dealing comfortably only with a few friends.  She talks so little that her teachers thought she was retarded and she was declared as a ward of the state.<br /><br />Dragan Armansky was born in Croatia.  His father was an Armenian Jew from Belorussia and his mother was a Bosnian Muslin of Greek descent.  He is CEO of Milton Security.<br /><br />Mikael Blomkvist is a journalist,  He is part owner and publisher of Millennium, a financial magazine.  He is greatly respected -- and hated -- in financial reporting.<br /><br />Erika Berger is a part owner and editor-in-chief of the Millennium.  She is also a longtime lover of Mikael.<br /><br />Henrik Vanger is the former head of the Vanger companies.  He had been a major industrialist within Sweden.<br /><br />In this story, Mikael is found guilty of libel and defamation against Hans-Erik Wennerstrom.  He had not even defended himself on the stand.  The media -- and especially his enemies -- have a field day with the story.<br /><br />Mikael is certain that he had been set up by Wennerstrom, but there was no way to prove it.  Despite the judgment, Erika wants him to stay with the magazine.  But Mikael thinks differently and they compose a press release announcing his resignation from his position at Millennium.<br /><br />Milton Security gets a request for a background investigation of Mikael.  Dragan asks Lisbeth if she will undertake the inquiry.  She agrees and finishes the task in record time.<br /><br />Henrik learns from the report that Mikael is very honest and loyal to his sources.  So he concludes the investigation and sends his agent to invite Mikael to his home in Norrland.  Mikael doesn't care for the idea at first, but then agrees to go for the interview.<br /><br />Henrik wants Mikael to write a biography of the Vanger family.  But this task will really be a cover for the finding of his granddaughter Harriet.  Henrik believes Harriet to be dead, but he wants to find her body and her killer.<br /><br />Mikael is offered two things in payment for these tasks.  First, he is offered one million kronors, with the possibility of a bonus.  Second, he is offered incriminating information about Wennerstrom's earlier employment by the Vanger companies.<br /><br />The latter payment convinces Mikael to work for Henrik.  He moves to the family estate in Hedeby and lives in the Vanger guest house.  He immediately starts learning about the Vanger family and gets a more thorough briefing on the disappearance of Harriet.  He soon finds that Henrik's disdain for most of his family is soundly based on facts.<br /><br />This tale involves Mikael in a fascinating examination of the missing Harriet.  He also learns some distasteful information on the family, including their involvement with the Nazis.  Eventually, Mikael brings Lisbeth into the case as a researcher.<br /><br />This novel is filled with dry facts on Swedish history, the characters, and their circumstances.  The translation is very good, but the background was unfamiliar, so the background information was helpful.  The fictitious history of the Vanger family seemed well integrated into the real history.<br /><br />Although Mikael seems to be the main character, Lisbeth is the most interesting.  The next installment is [[ASIN:030745455X The Girl Who Played with Fire]].  Read and enjoy!<br /><br />Highly recommended for Larsson fans and for anyone else who enjoys tales of foreign cultures, retroactive investigations, and intelligent women.<br /><br />-Bill Jordinhe Vanger family.

He soon finds that Henrik's disdain for most of his family is soundly based on facts.    This tale involves Mikael in a fascinating examination of the missing Harriet.  He also learns some distasteful information on the family, including their involvement with the Nazis.  Eventually, Mikael brings Lisbeth into the case as a researcher.    This novel is filled with dry facts on Swedish history, the characters, and their circumstances.  The translation is very good, but the background was unfamiliar, so the background information was helpful.  The fictitious history of the Vanger family seemed well integrated into the real history.    Although Mikael seems to be the main character, Lisbeth is the most interesting.  The next installment is [[ASIN:030745455X The Girl Who Played with Fire]].  Read and enjoy!    Highly recommended for Larsson fans and for anyone else who enjoys tales of foreign cultures, retroactive investigations, and intelligent women.    -Bill Jordin
B000058983|5.0|This album is so amazing it's difficult to review.  I was not familiar with Love until another reviewer friend of mine recommended them to me a few years ago, and didn't follow up until 6 months ago.  The first time I played this album, I realized I'd heard UFO cover \\"Alone Again Or\\" in high school, and was delighted to hear the original version for the first time.  Now I know what justice they did to the Latin flavored folk beauty.<br /><br />Since I was born in the mid-60s, all of this stuff is an unearthed treasure trove to me, and yours truly was definitely not prepared for the way this album blew my mind.  Some of you own the group from your youth, which my generation is nostalgic about, but each new discovery is such a delightful find for those of us who aren't so wild for today's new music.  This album is such a gloriously bohemian product that the sheer essence of its time sucks you right into it, which is never a bad thing.  People used to care about something aside from American Idol, facebook, and the commercial humdrum crud that keeps people from being personal and caring about something other than themselves.  I envy your generation for caring and trying, and this album is a fine case in point.<br /><br />Heavy on psychedelic and folk (full of string embellishments that don't hurt either), Forever Changes is such a wonderful adventure into surrealistic art.  Faves would be the touching \\"Andmoreagain\\" which I love to play constantly.  \\"The Red Telephone\\" is nothing short of brilliance, and was featured in the film Taking Woodstock, much to my delight.  The anti-Vietnam theme is constant, and yet there are portraits Arthur Lee paints of hip social scenes and the pleasantries of Utopia in a country full of ignorance.  Irony?  Was he trying to paint a picture of people who were so numbed by being fed the war morning, noon, and night that our nation turned away for their own pleasures to escape the madness?  We all have to go on.<br /><br />Love some of these song titles.  \\"Maybe the People Would be the Times or Between Clark and Hilldale?\\"  LOL, guess you can pick, but it's got a great hook and a rather accidentally commercial appeal.  Very nice Spanish guitar picking.<br /><br />\\"Live and Let Live:\\"  \\"The snot has caked against my pants.  It has turned into crystal?\\"  Umm, maybe some of the low reviewers have a point here, but then, try explaining Jethro Tull's classic, \\"Aqualung.\\"<br /><br />\\"The Good Humor Man He Sees Everything Like This:\\"  Visions of that temporary Utopia, but so beautifully portrayed.  Love the guitar riffs and horns about Arthur Lee's soft, sensitive voice.  This is easily my favorite track, because it is so childlike and charming that it's irresistible.<br /><br />\\"Bummer in the Summer\\" is folky soul strut with an attitude, but the original final cut, \\"You Make the Scene\\" is the most disturbingly striking cut on FC.  Arthur Lee's lyrics can be sometimes vague, but nobody has to guess that he is commenting on the decay of society and the bleakness of war-minded people, much less the futility of human life in general.  This is such a disturbing song for me, because of Vietnam vets I have known who came home to such a hostile response, but it is more personal than that.  \\"You think you're happy, and you are happy--that's what you're happy for.\\" Who can actually achieve this unless they are Bobby Rydell and Diane Renay?  Exactly.<br />\\"This is the only thing that I am sure of.  And that's every living thing is gonna die.  And there'll always be some be some people here to wonder why.  And for every happy hello there will be goodbye.\\"  This song always makes me think of my brother, who died of leukemia just before Christmas of 2008, and it is hard to hear because of those lines.  There are also too many references to how people barter for this and that out of purely selfish motivation.<br /><br />My review has already gone on too long, and I don't like doing that to people, but the bonus tracks arealso really worth your time.  Forever Changes is such an underrated and glorious work of art, that it is impossible to conceive the negative reviews here!  I would recommend this album to anyone who wants to hear great 60s baroque pop, but use your own judgement.such an underrated and glorious work of art, that it is impossible to conceive the negative reviews here!

B003J27WFW|4.0|Product arrived right on time, and in excellent condition... Couldn't hold back in ordering the DVD set after seeing the show on MTV ... Loved seeing Alex, Getty and Neil in their \\"natural\\" state. Was amazed at the early footage when John Rutsey was a member of the band before being replace by Neil Pert. Had a great laugh of their \\"80's\\" period, enjoyed hearing a bit about their personal lives without it going overboard.<br />My favorite footage is on the \\"extras\\" when the guys are hanging out at a restaurant for a few hours consuming wonderful food and several bottles of wine ...<br /><br />Would recommend for all of those who are both major and minor RUSH fans ... Myself and my husband would be in the major category considering that once the purchase was received we have watched the DVD 3 times in less than a month, and hubby couldn't resist buying tickets for upcoming concert in Aug :)while watching the show on t.v<br /><br />Will watch DVD time and time again even well after the concert has come to an end
B00000JQFL|5.0|I grew up with EWF.  First heard them on a Spanish radio station cleverly spinning \\"Power\\" when I was on holiday in Mallorca in 1973.  Needless to say I was highly impressed by the soprano saxophone which makes that track so great.      A couple of years later I saw them live back home in London as the warm up act to my favourite band of all time - Santana.  The crowd (and I) loved them both.  Maurice spun round as he hit the drum kit - what a sight! This set comes from that era.  It contains a short version of \\"Power\\".  The full eight minute studio version is on \\"Last Days and Time\\".  As a fan you probably knew that.  If you did not, it was good tip from me, was it not? Please mark this \\"HELPFUL\\" because, frankly, if you like EWF and have not heard the original version of Power, you have not lived yet!!
B002GJT4XW|4.0|These ultimate editions are a pretty good value, especially if you don't own the films on Blu-Ray yet. They're only about $10 more than the normal editions, and they come with loads of extras. However, I feel like when you call something an \\"ultimate\\" edition there's nothing more you can add to it. There's a lot here, but I think any Harry Potter fan would feel like you could have more content.<br /><br />What you do get are 3 discs loaded with stuff. You get pretty much everything you get from the original edition (which includes trailers, TV spots, deleted scenes, and a few other small features). What you get that's new is a 1 hour documentary of the making of the first film. it looks like each of these ultimate editions will come with a new chapter of making the film. So once all 8 films are released, you should end up with 8 hours of the making of Harry Potter.<br /><br />The packaging is pretty nifty. You get a hardcover art book, 2 cards (one of Harry and one of McGonagall), and a digipak case which contains the 3 discs. The art book has stills from the film, but the quality is exceptionally bad.<br /><br />I wish they had gone the Lord of the Rings Extended Editions route with these ultimate editions and re-cut the movie to include an hour of footage that you know they filmed but cut. I wish we had gotten commentaries from the actors and production team. I supposed we'll never get those now, since this is probably the last edition they'll release. It's a shame, because it could have really made this a great value and a must own for Harry Potter fans.<br /><br />So should you buy this? If you don't already own the films on Blu-Ray then it's definitely a must own. The extra content is worth the money. However, if you already own a Blu-Ray copy of the movie I can only recommend this for a die-hard Harry Potter fan. You're essentially paying $30 for a 1 hour documentary, a low-quality art book, some cards, and an extra cut of the film where they say \\"Philosopher's Stone\\" instead of \\"Sorcerer's Stone\\"
0345457692|5.0|I've had this book sitting there on my shelves for a few years. And since my latest foray into Richard Morgan territory didn't end up well, I wasn't in any hurry to give him another shot. The more fool me, of course. But everything surrounding my review of The Steal Remains sort of went down the crapper, especially when the Hype Files post went live while I was in Poland.   Still, I should have known better. And since I own everything Morgan has written thus far, I decided to bring Altered Carbon with my as I traveled around Southeast Asia. Let's just say that with all the rave reviews this novel has garnered over the years, my expectations were rather high. Although I didn't think he managed to do it with fantasy, with science fiction Richard Morgan can swing with the best of them. And he packs a powerful KO punch.     Simply put, Altered Carbon is definitely one of the best scifi novels I have read in my life. This seamless blend of science fiction/hard-boiled crime/cyberpunk novel is amazing. The more so when considering that this was Morgan's debut!     Here's the blurb:     In the twenty-fifth century, humankind has spread throughout the galaxy, monitored by the watchful eye of the U.N. While divisions in race, religion, and class still exist, advances in technology have redefined life itself. Now, assuming one can afford the expensive procedure, a person's consciousness can be stored in a cortical stack at the base of the brain and easily downloaded into a new body (or \\"sleeve\\") making death nothing more than a minor blip on a screen.     Ex-U.N. envoy Takeshi Kovacs has been killed before, but his last death was particularly painful. Dispatched one hundred eighty light-years from home, re-sleeved into a body in Bay City (formerly San Francisco, now with a rusted, dilapidated Golden Gate Bridge), Kovacs is thrown into the dark heart of a shady, far-reaching conspiracy that is vicious even by the standards of a society that treats \\"existence\\" as something thatcan be bought and sold. For Kovacs, the shell that blew a hole in his chest was only the beginning. . .     The noir setting is unforgettable. Morgan's depiction of 25st-century Earth is impeccable, and his eye for detail makes every scene leap off the pages. The many futuristic concepts are thought-provoking and keep the plot moving. The concept of sleeves, whereby an individual's consciousness and personality can be stored inside a brain and downloaded into another body, is just the beginning. Morgan's scifi debut resounds with so much depth, you'll be begging for more. Here's to hoping that the Takeshi Kovacs sequels will unveil more of what we were offered but a few tantalizing glimpses.     And yes, as great as the worldbuilding is, it's the fast pace Morgan maintains throughout Altered Carbon that truly makes this book this good. It reads like the best thrillers out there, and the author will keep you guessing till the very end.     The characterization is \\"top notch.\\" First person narratives can be tricky sometimes, but it's hard not to like Takeshi Kovacs' no-nonsense style. There is a lot more to this character than meets the eye, and hopefully Morgan reveals more about his backstory and his past as an Envoy in the sequels. Though Kovacs ain't the most likeable of characters, it's all but impossible not to root for him as he tries to crack this case. And yet, as fun as it is to follow the misadventures of Takeshi Kovacs, Morgan came up with an impressive cast of secondary characters. Chief among them Kristin Ortega, but also Laurens and Miriam Bancroft, as well as Reileen Kawahara. And like Robin Hobb, Richard Morgan, at least in this book, somehow managed to give life and personality to minor characters that don't necessarily play great roles in the bigger scheme of things, yet they feel important in the scenes in which they appear.     Altered Carbon features a multilayered plot that will keep you guessing and second-guessing yourself till the epilogue. Then all is revealed and it all makes sense. Richard Morgan is a genius and came up with what I'd describe as a genre masterpiece.     Intelligent, intriguing, inventive, exciting; I could go on and on. I was a complete dumbass to let this book lie there, awaiting my attention. If, like me, you haven't read Altered Carbon, don't be a dumbass. Buy it, read it, love it!     Richard Morgan's Altered Carbon deserves the highest possible recommendation.
0812932293|5.0|Everyone knows Richard Branson and his brand Virgin. Sure, he's a billionaire and writing a book when you're one makes it easy to become a bestseller. What surprised me about this book was its depth about his thoughts and down-to-earth manner which is was written in.<br /><br />Taking the first 43 years of the life of Richard Branson into one book creates a wonderful journey which makes much of us wonder what it would be like. Growing up in the 50's and being a teenager during the sexual revolution of the late 60's and early 70's Richard Branson is being very open about his private life at that stage. I think it is great for anyone to see that entrepreneurs grow not only their business, but more so themselves as well. Putting forward his experiences building up Student and later Virgin Music this has been a great example to see someone pushing his own boundaries each day again.<br /><br />Further down the book, business will get the best of the read and not so much the person of Richard Branson himself. This may be due to the fact that he more or less became his business, where in the first part of his life this role was reversed. The writings are nevertheless as exciting and you can actually 'feel' the growth of business and figures while reading. Having not disbanded the little facts of thousand dollar loans in the beginning of the book give you a great sense about the scaling-up that has taken place. Virgin Music expands, business troubles and failures are mentioned, but always success remains. There can be no adventure without failure.<br /><br />The last part of the book focusses on Virgin Atlantic, the airline. Where the book ends around 1993 much of the British Airways lawsuit and 'dirty tricks' campaign is being written about. Although these chapters were a great read and blows the mind of any James Bond loving viewer, I think the total chapters are out of proportion. Feelings are noted, but Richard Branson as a person and what it did to his private life are missing out. Sure, the lawsuit was a gruelling experience, as anyone can understand who once had one. It is the wonder of how he could remain doing business in his 'fun and positive' way while going through this process what interests me most.<br /><br />This book has been a great read and could be a valuable experience when you're in business. Forget about the billionaire, read about the entrepreneur.lawsuit was a gruelling experience, as anyone can understand who once had one.

B002QW7ALM|3.0|My impression as I watched the movie was that I was watching a horror flick, not a sci-fi movie. True there are some sci-fi references scattered throughout and at the beginning and the end but this is mostly a horror flick.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised by the ending which was very clever and came away thinking, with some of the Hollywood sensationalism removed, it could have made a pretty good sci-fi short story.<br /><br />If you're a horror fan, then this movie may please you. I had some problems understanding all of the dialog as the recording level of the voices varied a great deal. The bulk of the movie is in darkened locations that could have been anywhere which is always best for horror it seems.<br /><br />I gave it three stars as it did generate enough interest on my part to wonder where it was going and how things would turn out.<br /><br />My suggestion is to rent it first and measure the appeal, if you love it buy the disc.
B002VECM6S|4.0|Good movie, great story  with good acting but more of a Hallmark TV movie than an Oscar winning movie.
B000F5GNX8|5.0|You'll pee your pants laughing.  It's one of the most hilarious movies I've ever seen.  Although the plot involves a string of murders, they are lighthearted and funny (if murder could ever be funny) in a twisted sort of way.  Val Kilmar and Robert Downey Jr. have excellent rapport together, and Michelle Monihan is credible as the out-of-reach dream girl (with a twist).    Don't watch this movie with your tween!  Although there are no heavy sex scenes, the setting is the debauchery of Los Angeles and there's quite a bit of casual nudity (sometimes perverted).  Send the kids to bed early and try not to wake them up snorting diet coke through your nose.
B000P0J09M|4.0|Quality quite good except that halfway through the movie the viewer has to get up and flip the DVD to the other side.
B002XLBC0Q|5.0|If you love vynal, you will definately need to buy a copy of this fantastic release.    The artwork on the cover is as sharp as the original back in 1975 and the FridayMusic labels made similar to the Atlantic release with the green, white and red look great.    The real bonus is the gatefold cover with all the lyrics printed.    There was a very limited pressing of the Nightmare album in France in 1975 with a gatefold (before they reverted to the non gatefold cover) but even if you do have a copy of that hard to find record, you definately need this one in your collection as well.    This is simply another outstanding issue for any Alice Cooper or vynal collector, go and buy one!
B003N7GATM|4.0|If you want a bare bones description of How to Destroy Angels, suffice to call this Nine Inch Nails with a female lead singer. The approach is at times similar, the riffs have hints from Year Zero, the Slip and even a large dose of the close remix you can hear in the Seven Soundtrack and the Deluxe edition of Downward Spiral... but there's enough here to not only keep your NIN fix under control, but to see that this just might get very different.     To boot, if you want to have leather bound goth frolickings, I sincerely recommend this album because some songs are simply meant for that. All I really know though is that I'm looking way forward to a complete album and am very very intrigued at what other tricks are up their collective sleeve.
B001MYIXAW|5.0|Theirs not much to say here just watch the movie and you will be amazed. Its a great love story and very realistic unlike Twilight which the vampires are immune to sunlight. The film is beautifully directed and the cinematography is great, definitely a keeper. Don't wanna go into the movie but you won't be let down its a very emotional and awkward journey.
B001EN71DG|5.0|INCREDIBLE! Disk 2 of each film has the original unaltered movies in widescreen. The only other place you could find that is on laser disk or if you saw a film print in theaters. Hell of a deal and loop hole!
B001MEJY8W|4.0|When I watched this I didn't know rather to cry or throw up ! I have to say this is what real horror is all about. But I truly felt sorry for these people when normally I'm laughing. Beware if you have a weak stomach especially the ending sequence. I was so shocked at how much violence was in this movie they even showed children being murdered ? This is a good movie but I just can't give it 5 stars because it's too depressing. I watched this once and once was good enough for a while. Watch this at your own risk and definitely prepare for the end. Because the people in this film are truly sick and unmerciful to say the least. This movie is truly Gut wrenching and that's putting it nicely !
B003X9W98G|4.0|This season was very good. I did not feel like I wasted my time watching any of the episodes, obviously some were better than others but that's to be expected in any show. I enjoyed Matt Smith as The Doctor it is completely different than how David Tennant was so I can see why people that were huge fans of Tennant's would be turned off by Matt Smith. Personally I did not like David Tennant as The Doctor but I still overall enjoyed his years and I'd give all of them a 3.5 rating. For me though Season 1 with Christopher Eccleston as The Doctor is head and shoulders above all the other seasons so far.  Anyway this season was a good start in my opinion for Matt Smith as The Doctor and I am looking forward to see where The Doctor, Amy, and Rory go from here.
B000SZH66S|5.0|I'm a big fan of magic music, by which I mean music that casts a spell on the listener. Music which creates an atmosphere. Which transports you, if only in your own mind, to another place, or at very least another mood. Mazzy Star excels at this: \\"So Tonight That I Might See\\" and \\"Among My Swan\\" are probably two of the most magic, atmospheric, mood-creating albums I've ever listened to. They may as well have come with candles and red wine in the liner notes, or maybe a hookah pipe and some absinthe; in other words, they are the sort of stuff you'd hear at The Bronze on \\"Depressing Night.\\" Except that they aren't so much depressing as just wonderfully melancholy.<br /><br />\\"She Hangs Brightly\\" is a departure from the Mazzy playbook. Yes, it's got the type of wistful, calmly brokenhearted tracks you'd expect from Hope Sandoval & Company, but it's livelier, and shows more emotional and stylistic range, than you might expect.<br />The first four tracks, \\"Halah\\", \\"Blue Flower\\", \\"Ride It On\\", and \\"She Hangs Brightly\\" are trademark Mazzy, but with \\"I'm Sailin'\\", the band steps out of its comfort zone, adopting a bluesy, Nawlin's-style twang, which is resumed on \\"Taste of Blood\\" and hinted at on \\"Free.\\" But it's the aggressive, hauntingly repetetive, almost trippy sound of \\"Ghost Highway\\" that sounds least like ordinary Mazzy: this song jarred me a bit when I first heard it, as it's like something out of a certain creepy mind-bending David Lynch movie. However, classic Maz resumes for the last two songs (\\"Free\\" and \\"Before I Sleep\\") to round out the show.<br /><br />You will notice I left out \\"Be My Angel\\" from this list, and that's because it deserves a little extra wattage on the spotlight. If there was ever a song that summed up the band that created it, this is it. Combine Hope Sandoval's ethereal-sounding voice with the half-inspirational, half-morose lyrics --<br /><br />Don't say \\"Love me\\" if you don't need me<br />Don't send me roses on your behalf<br />Just take me down and walk through your river<br />Down in the middle and make it last<br />Holdin on to you holdin on to me<br />Holdin on tight, to my lover's cross<br />Don't say it's useless and don't say forget it<br />You are my spirit and now you are gone<br /><br />-- that somehow manage to hit you right in the ticker without coming off as maudlin sap, and you have Mazzy at its best. I don't know how they do it; maybe it's that feeling that Hope is singing in great pain, but with a kind of calm acceptance and no self-pity, and maybe just the slightest hint of humor at her own suffering. Whatever. It doesn't really matter; what does is that what Mazzy does, only Mazzy can do, and they do it well on \\"She Hangs Brightly.\\"r   Down in the middle and make it last   Holdin on to you holdin on to me   Holdin on tight, to my lover's cross   Don't say it's useless and don't say forget it   You are my spirit and now you are gone     -- that somehow manage to hit you right in the ticker without coming off as maudlin sap, and you have Mazzy at its best.

B0000BYM3K|2.0|One is Rainmaker, one of the band's all-time best songs, the other is Age of Innocence, an underrated mid-tempo rocker.  Why do these songs feel complete?  Because they are the only songs on the album that sound as if they were thought out before the band started recording them.<br /><br />No More Lies, Montsegur, and Paschendale are okay; with some editing and much better production they would be classics.  As such, they are all over-long and overly loud.  New Frontier and Gates of Tomorrow are two up-tempo fillers, and if only more thought had been put into them they might have been half-way decent.<br /><br />The rest of the songs, however, are dire.  Wildest Dreams is horrendous.  The title track doesn't even start until the three minute mark, and it's an eight-minute track.  Face in the Sand is six and a half minutes of cacophony.  Journeyman is an ill-advised venture into acoustic ballads.<br /><br />Basically, this is The X Factor Part 4, Virtual XI and Brave New World being the two previous ones.  Overlong songs, repetitive choruses, banal song structures, awful production.  Maiden is in desperate need of a producer who has the balls to end Steve Harris' creative stranglehold on this band.
B003HARV3Y|3.0|The book is almost always best than the movie, so it goes without saying that is the case with Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The Lightning Thief.  Clarisse is not in the movie at all and it seems like they are trying to blend her character with Annabeth.  Also Ares isn't really in the movie and neither is Kronos.    For adaptation from the book to the big screen I would give this movie a \\"D\\", but that being said, I think if you haven't read the book it is actually a pretty good movie.
0399156577|5.0|As a Nora Roberts fan, I was excited for the release of The Search because I live in the area where it took place and am owned by two beautiful and loving yellow Labs.  Therefore, it was easy for me to fall into the story and relate to the wonderful characters Nora developed.  One thing I have appreciated as Nora Roberts has developed her writing style over the years is her approach to dialogue.  It has become snappy, fun, interesting and unexpected.  With The Search, I loved going through the dog and human training that occurred in the book, and had to try some of the described techniques with my boys.  Nora Roberts is not writing for a Pulitzer Prize, and freely admits this, but she writes for the enjoyment of her millions of fans and meets that goal with each new book she produces.  I appreciate that she finds new topics and venues to write about, and will continue to look forward to her publications as long as she produces books for her reading fans.  Your choice, read it now and enjoy it, or wait for the paperback.  For me, I couldn't wait to crack open the first page and devour the adventures of Fee, Simon and the dogs.
B000FUF6QS|4.0|If you've read the booklet that comes with the CD soundtrack, and you've seen both the 88-minute DVD and the 101-minute VHS, then you know you win some, lose some.<br /><br />I was dismayed to find that apparently the long cut was never released on DVD, although the commentaries by the cast and production crew somewhat make up for this. Only after you've watched the commentary and read the CD companion booklet, can you fully appreciate how excellent this film turned out to be---despite testimonials from the cast and crew that EVERYTHING seemed to go wrong during the production. Christopher Lee even made the remark that maybe the old Celtic gods worked their magic on the movie after all by the fact that it became a cult classic even though by rights it should have been an utter bust. The Wicker Man was truly British Lion's swan song.<br /><br />Missing from the DVD are the beginning scene where Sgt. Howie, still in his station, reads the letter about Rowan's disappearance; the scene where Lord Summerisle induces a teenage boy to undergo a rite of passage by sending him to Willow, and then gives a florid narrative on reproduction; and the scene in which the village doctor explains to Howie that Rowan was burnt to death.<br /><br />As for the storyline, Sgt. Howie's ignorance of the Old Religion is his undoing. He is a bachelor with a badge, and he doesn't realize until the very end that he's been tricked. Worse, no surrogate is available to stand in for him when he keeps his appointment with the Wicker Man.<br /><br />Overall, this movie tells us some things about the tenets of the Old Religion, though any true neo-pagans who've seen this movie will readily tell you it's something of an embarrassment to them because of its over-emphasis on sex and reproduction. However, I personally studied the Old Religion since I was twelve, and as reenactments of pagan rites go, this one is pretty good. It is a must-read for anyone interested in the Old Religion or Wicca, especially the Celtic rites which seemed to survive the longest in France and the British Isles.<br /><br />The Wicker Man is classed as a horror film, though I think it would best be categorized as an occult thriller. I'm not alone in lamenting that the motion picture industry sorely needs to release the long cut on DVD. After all, the people who put the soundtrack together found the original audio tracks in a storage facility where they'd been forgotten for decades---not entombed beneath the pavement of a highway as they'd feared. I hold out hope that someone in the motion picture industry will realize the fans of this movie (myself included) love it so much that we're willing to buy it in the form it was meant to be enjoyed, and the long cut will finally be available on DVD.<br /><br />Hail Queen of the May!to survive the longest in France and the British Isles.

B000TUXL2A|5.0|It's hard to describe the measure of talent that is displayed by Mark Knopfler in this enchanting effort.  If you were to put in equal measure a bit of world-weariness displayed by Springsteen in Devils & Dust with the optimism displayed by Christian Floyd in Dreams Into Daylight, as well as a host of other influences and throw on top of all of that Knopfler's signature dynamic lead guitar style, you'd still only describe a shade of the brilliance of Kill to Get Crimson.  I simply can't say enough good things about this CD!
B000I0FTN0|1.0|I would totally buy this, but renting it would rob me of the ability to savor it.  No thanks.  The material is phenomenal, a real British Machiavellian pleasure, a pity the price of admission is so exclusive.
B001TN1EBG|5.0|Emotionally driven, supremely well-executed song-craft from a prolific writer.  If you enjoy other artists, such as Joshua Radin or Christian Floyd, you will definitely enjoy William Fitzsimmons!  Highly recommended.

1423119509|5.0|This set is the 5 books of the Percy Jackson/Olympians series, in hardback, in a flip-top box.  The stories are fun, exciting for the 10 to 15 year old crowd and those who are young at heart and looking for adventure stories.  The books are decently bound;  typical quality for hardbacks, neither the very cheap style you sometimes find in book clubs nor exceptionally durable public library quality binding.  The box they come in has a \\"hinged\\" top (paper flap, not metal hinges) and is made of durable cardboard.  If well cared for it will last, but it would not tolerate a damp environment nor traveling or rough handling well.  There is a tiny packet of \\"souveniers\\" in the bottom of the box that we haven't even looked at (we bought it for the stories).
B001CT877Q|4.0|This film has suspense and action played out by John alias Arnold. He is with the witness protection program and he works alone. He does his job well and comes across as a man without alot of words but one who seems to care about those who cross his path in his line of work. He takes on a witness for a corporation that deals with intricate weaponry. This character is played by Vanessa, she comes across as a strong woman who is trying to get information for the fbi. She isnt prepared for the type of assault that comes from the force of criminal activity. Luckily, John is there to help her, he takes her out of harms way after they try to kill her in her house. It doesn't show much in the way of emotions, sadness, love affair, but the story line is good. John's boss is involved in a double cross with the government and the company under surveillance. His boss and others are selling weapons not accounted for to terrorist groups heightening their accesibility to more powerful technology. I liked to watch how John worked in his field of government. Parachuting seems fun but pretty frightening, which was one of the action sequences in the film. The suspense in obtaining secret info seems like an adventurous job yet its not a game, a risk of life or death. The ability to protect someone against extreme danger would be a scary prospect. The film does and it doesn't take life as valuable. What I mean is that when her male friend dies she doesn't seem to grieve. Even the bad guys get plowed by a train. Yet it does take it seriously because it is a job which saves a person's life. An action film that has the strength of an interesting plot. I liked it and think it holds your interest, especially the beginnings of the film, the end does not hold you as captive.
B000UG78NG|5.0|I don't write reviews very often; rather, I tend to read others in determining whether I should take the time to read the book.  I learned of this one through Penny Arcade.  This recommendation alone asserts how awesome Mike and Jerry are.    Anyway, the book is fantastic.  While the beginning is slowand the writing leaves something to be desired - and believe me, only in the beginning - once the story gets its legs about four chapters in, it is a story I can only describe as fantastic.  The main character is believable.  His story will illicit emotion unlike any other books that I have read for quite awhile.  And I think it comes from how simple the story is.  It's . . . wonderful.      Please do yourself a favor and read this book.
B0021L8V1G|5.0|This movie truly delivered. I've read a lot of people give credit to IM2 for \\"sheer entertainment value\\" they should also acknowledge that it's smart, well structured and offered GREAT performances. Oscar level performances to go with the thrills and the laughs mark a huge winner in my book. Iron Man was a great film but IM2 took everything movie one did and expanded on it. Iron Man was a great film but IM2 took everything movie one did and expanded on it. After going darker and deeper with Tony, they placed him again in \\"creator\\" mode just like the first movie. This gave some of the same flavor to the film as the first. That was a wonderful creative decision. Add the best final act in comic movie history and why wouldn't this be called one of the best ever?
055358202X|4.0|This certainly isn't my favorite book of the series so far but given the review's I feel like I need to step up the defense of A Feast for Crows.(There's a few spoilers here)    Like some other readers, I was impatient on my first reading, feeling like the plot had slowed down and that I wished I could know what was happening in the north. But to read this book just for the plot (and the plot is great, as always) is to miss Martin taking the depth of his work to a new level. It forces one to view characters not just from whether we like their personality or whether or not they are personally honorable, but through the lens of the consequences of their actions on other people, unnoticed people as well as the famous.    Viewed through this lens, Varys can be viewed as the heroic ideal of ASOIAF. The Whisperer does not appear in Feast, but his ethos is fully echoed in Meribald's speech. Varys has no personal ambition; he has no lusts; he cares not whether he is liked or hated. Like Meribald, he has learned to shed his ego for a larger purpose. He is viewed with contempt and mistrust by those he serves. Once he is asked what his goals are, and he answers with a single word: peace. He strives to prevent what has happened in Feast, and his failure does not make him less heroic. He tries and fails to save Ned Stark's life, not for one man, but because he knows Ned's death means war and death across Westeros. Unlike Littlefinger who schemes for power, Varys schemes for peace. He is common born, mistreated, castrated, and he is one of the few in a position of power in ASOIAF who thinks of the impact \\"The Game of Thrones\\" has on the common man.    Coming back to Meribald's speech, it's worth noting where it occurs in both place and time. It comes halfway through the fourth book of a seven book series; it is halfway through Feast, and halfway through the whole series. It is a moment of calm. It comes after Brienne's fight with Shagwell and friends, Tarly's hanging of outlaws,and before Saltpans, the row of hanged outlaws, and Brienne's terrible encounter with Rorge and Biter. It comes as they walk through a peaceful, open land of water and marshes and simple folk, less than a day from the horrors of war. It is a call to peace and calm amidst the ravages of war. And it gives Brienne's quest a deeper meaning. Her quest to find Sansa or Arya and fulfill her promise to Catelyn can also now be seen as a quest to defend those unable to defend themselves, to be the 'true knight' that men will never see her as because of her sex. Brienne's quest is a quest of the mundane - it could occur in a world without magic or the fantastic.    I simplify of course, as there are countless other questers in the series. But I don't think it's too much at all to say this speech is the Heart and Soul of Feast; the reminder of the consequences of violence. If you doubt that this is what this is about, look at the character that one could say begins and ends this book: Catelyn. Her unexpected arrival in the epilogue of Storm shows her as something no longer fully human: she has become vengeance personified, like the Greek furies. In the epilogue and through much of Feast we are happy thinking of her - we take a grim delight in her hanging Freys and other scum wherever she finds them. But at the end, in hanging Pod and Brienne she seems cruelly unfair, whether or not they survive. Brienne has given so much to fulfill her word to Catelyn, and to be treated so seems unjust in the extreme. But Catelyn is neither fair nor unfair, she is simply vengeance - a demander of blood for what has been done to her and her own. We like it when the Freys bleed, Brienne not at all.    Thoros' speech near the end of Feast where he acknowledges how war has warped their band of 'honorable' bandits is a perfect echo of Meribald's speech. The best intentions of Dondarrion, who gave everything to uphold the rule of Robert, has ended through the process of war in a band of cutthroats who are almost as bad as those they hunt. Here, as in King's Landing with the new High Septon, the smallfolk are having their revenge, but with Martin, all violence brings an enormous price.    And with these ruminations ended, I, like so many others, can't wait for Dance and am thrilled beyond measure to read that GRRM is close to finishing A Dance with Dragons. For Feast is the pause and the reflection at the center of the series, and with Dance comes the plot roaring onwards downhill with full force, I suspect.
B003ITZBVS|4.0|okay, the short review is as follows:  >> action, story, dialogue is great. die hard batman fans = buy, pedestrians = rent. *not for young children*    and now the long review:  >> first off, i'm reviewing this as modern age batman fan. i grew up on the animated series [and yes, batman DOES have the best rogues gallery]. i feel that as complex as batman's characters are, once you understand them, their interactions between one another become very clear. that being said, Batman: Under the Red Hood definitely delivers. the re-introduction of Jason Todd into DCU proper was nothing short of inspired and they did a fantastic job translating Jason's story into an animated short.  >> the script was great because it told a simple, fluid 'revenge story' that really didn't leave any plot holes. i like that the creative team pulled from different source materials to make a DARK, gritty, action packed movie. the dialogue between the characters was spot on and delivered with precision. all of the voice actors were great but i was very impressed with Jensen Ackles voicing Jason Todd. for a character that's never before given a literal voice, Ackles conveyed JT's emotion and purpose brilliantly.  >> as for the extras on the dvd, it's always nice to have subtitles. there are a few trailers for previous dcu animated movies, as well as trailers for 'the Lord of the Rings, animated', 'Jonah Hex Motion Comic' and 'Legend of the Guardians'. the best extra is the 'First Look at Superman/Batman Apocalypse', the next dcu animated movie [it tells the story of Supergirl's return to the DCU proper].  >> all in all it was a great movie. i didn't give it a 5/5 because there will always be room to improve, 99% of the time. in my personal opinion, it would have been more compelling to swap out Nightwing for the third Robin, Tim Drake..or hey, include all three Robins; but it would've probably gone over the 75 minute mark. i wish there was a commentary track but there isn't one. and yes, there area few other things that i could nitpick at but it's really just that, nitpicking. the DVD is great and my only regret in purchasing it, is not having purchased the two-disc special instead. good job DC!

B0039TD7PY|5.0|This CD will be in my collection absolutely forever.  I can honestly say that I will never get tired of listening to it.  I have had it for months, and still tear up in a few of the songs.  Loved the people, Loved the lyrics, loved the music, went to the concert, have the Cd and DVD; it's part of my history now.  Ask my 3 year old who we love to listen to?  \\"James Taylor!\\"(incidentally his name too) and my 1.5 year old finishes with \\"Carole King!\\"
B000NU2CY4|1.0|I fully concur with the other reviews here of the Blu-ray release of this film.  Outstanding move, atrocious picture quality.    But there's hope...    Paramount has just announced the release of a newly re-mastered version and an exchange program for those duped into buying this version.  Call this number to arrange for your replacement disk:  (888) 889-9456.    For those who have yet to buy, the new re-mastered version should be available in stores soon.  It will be identifiable by a yellow UPC label (the original was white).
0375815996|5.0|As a child I loved the regular version of this book so my mother bought the cloth version for my baby girl.  I was a little skeptical - thinking that this wasn't a story that a child a soft book age would enjoy (not enough rhythm or rhyme).  My little one has loved this since I introduced it to her at approximately 6 months (should have done it sooner).  She loves playing with and inspecting the birdie.  She loves looking at the bright colors (especially the red which is a color that babies see early).  We know that this is one of her favorite things because she takes it with her when she rolls or scoots.  I see the complaints about the original story being abbreviated.  I understand where the person is coming from because the original story is better but I accept this for what it is - a first book for a baby.  In that way it is absolutely perfect.  I was not familiar with cloth books before my mother got this for us and I am so glad that she did.  I am going to try to post a picture or two (she is holding the book above her head while laying on the floor - absolutely adorable).
B00026WU9Q|5.0|In the process of updating music collection, we jump back and forth in time with each artist. Purchased Dylan's \\"Together Through Life\\" was first time hearing his newer voice register...it was a little shocking! After the first time through, that album grew on us. We turned back in time to \\"Bringing It All Back Home\\" because we never had this album on vinyl or cassette. Old favorites (along with his old voice) just sound so great. The Subterranean Homesick Blues is classic, loved the Love Minus Zero and finished off with It's All Over Now, Baby Blue. This album should be in any Dylan collection. Don't hesitate to get Love and Theft also, it's more recent with his voice, but I tell ya'...he always sounds great...and do YOU still sound the same after 40 years????
B003956Z8O|4.0|I love MGMT so this was hyper attractive to me. It comes with the collector's scratch off coin containing symbols pertaining to the last verses of \\"Flash Delirium\\" freakin' cool. My only problem is I don't want to scratch off the \\"Scratch-off\\" cover cuz I find it looks so cool as it is. :P Oh, and I would've hoped for more pictures and cool stuff in the booklet, what there is is individual band member pictures and pics from around the mansion they recorded the album in.
0545123283|4.0|An interesting turn of events in a follow-up novel. If you think about it, the plot is almost too ironic.  The author pulls it off though, and even though you see it coming a mile away you find yourself in denial right along with Sam.  My only disappointment was with Grace's parents attitude, and by her reaction.  Her parents did a complete 180 out of nowhere.  And she just sat there.  That was a little strange, the Grace in the first book wouldn't have let them treat her like that without a fight.  The ending is a cliffhanger, and left me a little depressed.  But I like when a book affects me enough to still feel something when it's over.  I cannot wait to see how this series ends, it's just so different from other supernatural books right now and a nice break from vampires.
B0015DROBO|5.0|For some reason, I kept passing over this book.  Then, my daughter recommended I read it.  I downloaded it to my Kindle, started reading, and couldn't put it down until I finished.  Somewhere in the middle of it, I stopped long enough to download the next two books in the series. I'm now in the middle of the third book and am already upset that this is the last one.
0465043577|5.0|Benoit Mandelbrot presents a very sophisticated approach to describing the statistics of financial markets.  The assumption of gaussian statistics is often the starting point for modeling many phenomena.  Sophisticated modelers soon realize that gaussian statistics are inadequate in many cases; and so, it is not surprising that gaussian statistics fail in modeling financial markets.  I can only hope that the organizations that analyze risk for retirement investments and the plans that these organizations recommend do not use gaussian statistics in predicting possible retirement financial scenarios.
B000UBMWG4|5.0|Well, this one has it all. The image quality is superb (as would be expected) and the soundtrack has more punch than ever before. Needless to say, opinions on which cut of Blade Runner is the best will continue on ad infinitum, but with this collection you can pretty much view them all and choose your favorite.
0811806405|5.0|Terrific book. There are lots of details which help one to make design changes with confidence.  With the aid of this book ( and a little hlp from my friends ) I build my first acoustic guitar which came out great.
0312370849|5.0|This is a beautiful book. It was a very easy read. I read it in three days. It is the tragic story of a little girl's horrid childhood infused with a American publisher living in Paris with her troublesome husband. Each chapter in the first part of the book goes back and forth from both stories and then at the end they all tie together. The ending leaves the reader to make their own ending. This is definitely worth while. 5 stars.
B0007DAZW8|1.0|From the first eponymous track the album has a common theme on most of the songs: they introduce interesting sounds and fail to do anything with them, so halfway through every track has fallen flat on its face. Even my favorite track (Make Love) feels like trying to grasp air, it just goes on without any development and it makes me sad because it had a good foundation. What makes the album truly disappointing though is a lack of life in the music: everything here was half done so you never can connect with any of it.
030745455X|5.0|For me, this book was better than the first. I enjoyed Dragon Tattoo, but I found this one to be a lot more suspenseful. I am plunging right in to the third after reading where Fire left off. There is a lot of background in this story as to where Salander is from and explains her status as ward of the state. There are many evil characters involved and lots of murder and mayhem. If you liked the first book, you'll love this one. It moved at a quicker pace and had a lot more story to it.<br /><br />I think at times, some things might be lost in translation, but altogether, I found this story very strong and I had a hard time putting it down.<br /><br />Salander moves into a high end apartment and stays hidden a lot of the time, but some character's from the last book are justly rewarded. The book ends with a major cliff hanger that will have you reaching for the third book to find out what happens next. I wish there could be more of these novels as Salender is a great hero who's a lot of fun to read about, and care about.<br /><br />This series is a top notch mystery series written by a genious author who drives plot and character with unbelievable force.
030726999X|5.0|What a great trilogy! I loved all three novels. It's been many years since a thriller kept me up hours after my normal bedtime, but this book did that. This book was great, but was different than the first two. First, it was not a mystery to the reader. The first hundred pages or so mostly followed the bad guys as they plotted their cover-up after after the murder of Zalachenko. We know what's happening as the protagonists work to figure things out. This worked well. This novel picked up right where the previous novel ended. Unlike the first two Stieg Larsson novels, this does not stand on its own. You need to read the The Girl Who Played With Fire first, and it's best to not let too much time elapse before starting the third book. That first hundred pages is a bit slow and confusing. In fact, throughout the whole novel, there were so many characters introduced that I had to work very hard to keep on top of them. The effort, though, is worth it. After page 100, we switch to following Salander, Blomkvist, and the police supporting them, and I was hooked. With numerous interconnected subplots, this novel drew me and and became pure fun. This has action, suspense, great characters, and maybe the best courtroom drama ever. The final hundred pages were the most riveting and fun of any of the three novels. This made up for the slow start. What a reading treat.

B000BNX4MC|4.0|As several here have noted, there are flaws in this Special Edition of \\"Ferris Bueller\\" (the not-included John Hughes commentary track, lack of participation in the anniversary documentary by several of the cast, most notably Mia Sara, some missing deleted scenes and outtakes, and the theatrical trailer), but all this having been said, of the editions available to own, at present, \\"Ferris Bueller's Day Off Bueller...Bueller... Edition (Special Collector's Edition)\\" is, to me, the best choice. The price is incredibly reasonable, the bonus material that IS offered is fun, and if you want something to enjoy until the 'ultimate' one appears, I don't think you'll do better, truthfully!<br /><br />John Hughes was our generation's Preston Sturges; a brilliantly gifted screenwriter who revealed, as a director, a unique, original vision in a handful of film classics, then burned out, tragically, gradually fading from the scene. Where Sturges specialized in likable, working class characters in escalating, awkward situations, Hughes was the voice of the young, revealing their maturity, as well as angst, in a series of wonderful comedies set at key moments of their lives...and \\"Ferris Bueller\\" is one of the best. As portrayed by the perfectly-cast Matthew Broderick, in his breakthrough role, Bueller is the archetypical likable high school 'user', smarter than the rest of the world, but guileless, willing to share his 'grand vision' with those he cares about. Just a tad less gifted is his jealous younger sister (Jennifer Grey), who never seems to get the 'breaks' he enjoys, and, of course, the nemesis is the authority figure, the vice principal (Jeffrey Jones), furious that Bueller so effortlessly can twist the rules his way! The film splits into plotlines involving each character, as Bueller and his best friends (Mia Sara and Alan Ruck) enjoy the ultimate 'skip' day, his sister attempts to 'out' him to the parents, meeting bad boy Charlie Sheen in the process, and Jones, intending to publicly punish him, is inflicted with a never-ending series of slapstick disasters. Each storyline is very funny, and the end result is one of the best films of the 1980s!<br /><br />I hope the 'ultimate' Bueller film is made, someday, but until then, this edition is quite nice in my collection!ublicly punish him, is inflicted with a never-ending series of slapstick disasters.

0385523904|5.0|This is a well-written, moving, stirring book, which recounts the stories of several North Koreans, some of whom are such unlikely defectors I spent part of the book wrapped up in the mystery of 'How is she telling this person's story'? Perhaps the best thing about this book, beside the peek inside the enigmatic country, is that, in a world where sympathy and empathy are bombarded by media coverage, this is no 15 second news clip, but an examination of the lives of people (many of whom embraced very alien ideology) in extremity. It teaches us to care about the lives of people in the grip of a regime that would really rather we forget. It also rewakens our mercy, and rekindles hope that the lives of the oppressed can change. That makes this well worth the read.
0307592839|5.0|Jennifer Egan has written one of the most unique and entertaining novels I've read in a long time.  Each of its thirteen chapters is told from the perspective of a different character, yet each of them connects in some way to other characters in the overall story.  The central figures in Goon Squad are Bennie and Sasha. He's a former punk rocker working in the music industry, and she worked for a time as his assistant.  But they each only get a chapter in the early part.  From then on, other people carry the story.  Usually (but not always), the character in a chapter is someone who appeared as a secondary or even tertiary figure in the previous chapter.  It's as if you were on a web page, clicked on a topic, and then the page for that topic came up.  Then you clicked on another item in the new page, and so on.  The events in the novel are spread out over about a 40-year time period, beginning in the nostalgic past and ending somewhere is a vaguely depressing possible future.  Ms Egan's writing is brilliant on many levels.  The characters she created are interesting people, simultaneously like us and yet with enough peculiar behaviors and unpredictable actions to keep me glued to the page.  The stories themselves are often sad, funny, and captivating.  I especially loved the tales in chapters 8 & 9.  Much has been made of the stylistic boldness of this book, which uses different formats in different chapters, including a magazine article, powerpoint slides, and text messages (called simply \\"T's\\" in the future).  She also uses all three persons at different times for the POV; first, second & third.  However, most of that is just integrated into a relatively standard narrative, with the major exception of the powerpoint chapter.  That chapter, told by Sasha's 12 year old daughter, is a strikingly unusual piece of prose.  I wasn't sure I'd be able to follow the story within the slides there, but I did (also admiring the way the flowchart approach to storytelling alters the ways the message can be received).  Earlier this year I had a very negative reaction to an annoyingly gimmicky novel called Ilustrado, where it seemed like the author was way too clever for his own good.  With Ms Egan's new book, however, all of her adventurous ideas worked really well for me.  In fact, it's a book I'll be recommending enthusiastically to my more adventurous acquaintances.the ways the message can be received).

B003L20ICE|2.0|Okay, yes, the acting on everyone's part was great.  And yes, it showed-- surprise, surprise!-- that lesbians are like everyone else.  But why does all the hype about this movie, including the money shot featured in all the ads, give the impression it's warm and open-hearted?  The Mark Ruffalo character, whose only crime was to donate sperm that these two women used to create a family that they love, is contacted by the kids (he is not the one who reached out), hit on by the Julianne Moore character (he is not the one who kissed first), steers his son in the right direction with respet to a destructive friend, and even dumps his gorgeous girlfriend because he's starting to get feelings of wanting to be in a family, and at the end of all that he has the door slammed in his face and is told he's an interloper.  The final shot of him shows him looking longingly through the living room window at his son, while his son turns his back on him.  And we're also supposed to, what, laugh?, at the fact that the Latino gardener gets fired simply because the Julianne Moore character feels guilty that she slept with a man.      This film was made by a lesbian who is married and has a child via sperm donation.  Fine, it's her film she can do what she wants.  But it's kind of sad that the warm humanity in evidence does not extend to any adult male character in the film.  It resulted in a movie that did not \\"feel good,\\" IMHO (and FYI, I am a woman).

0765348276|3.0|I really wanted to like Old Man's War, but after the first hundred pages this book really loses steam and devolves into action sequence after action sequence.  Basically, the beginning of the book revolves around the question of \\"Why choose 75 year old's to fight a war?\\"  It's an intriguing question, and I found myself racing through the early pages of the book to arrive at the answer.  However, once the logic of choosing old men (and women) to become soldiers is explained, there's basically no more suspense or tension left to the plot. We basically get battle scene after battle scene, each lacking any real stakes or drama.       The main character, although witty and creative, is surrounded by supporting characters who are completely forgettable and one note.  You have Thomas, the doctor who likes to eat, Maggie, the quiet girl who is beautiful, and Alan, who is gay, and half a dozen others who quickly die off in a way that lacks any sort of emotional impact.  The aliens introduced in this book fall into a similar pattern--most feel like generic aliens ripped from Twilight Zone episodes and Doctor Who.      However, the book reads quickly, the dialogue is fun, and the the author never seems to take the story too seriously.  Neither should you.
B001E95ZI8|5.0|Caught it on HBO and was very very surprised.  It was so much better than I thought it would be.  Funny and fun pretty much sums it up... but all the songs were really good on top of it.  The movie went fast and left you wishing there was more.  One of those where I found myself sad it was over... I'd liked to have seen more from the characters.  Great cast... great casting.  It is not often that a movie steps up to exceed expectations but when it does, it makes it even that much more enjoyable.
B0025KVLSI|5.0|The rush of their first three albums is supplanted here by a melancholia. The harmonies show them to be at their most Everly Brothers-influenced ever. The album jacket reveals them to look world-wearied, however, that doesn't neccessarily inform the material. Though \\"Mr. Moonlight\\" is a lapse of prudent judgement, all the other covers work. \\"Rock And Roll Music\\" has the same shivering explosiveness of \\"Money\\" and \\"Twist And Shout\\" and I do love the charm of Ringo singing \\"Honey Don't\\". George's rockabilly guitar phrasings inspire both Carl Perkins inclusions. The John and Paul duet on Buddy Holly's \\"Words Of Love\\" bests his great original and there goes George's fine fretwork again. \\"Every Little Thing\\" is just another irresistable euphoric love song in the Lennon-McCartney catalogue. But the striking  \\"I'm A Loser\\", \\"Baby's In Black\\" and \\"I Don't Want To Spoil The Party\\" let the darkness creep in. And first prize goes to John's scornful \\"No Reply\\", a complete story of repudiated lover and a double-crossing woman with an assertive lead vocal that intensifies its drama.
B000JK8OYU|3.0|I held off buying this disc for a very long time (oh, 4 years?) because I feared it would be just another Beatles compilation (like [[ASIN:B00004ZAV3 The Beatles 1]]) assembled to assuage the hunger of a world without any songwriters left.  Now that Yoko and Paul have decided that backcatalog plundering is acceptable we've been subjected to a few too many \\"fly on the wall\\" releases -- and you know what flies are attracted to.<br /><br />Then I heard that [[ASIN:B000JK8OYU Love]] was remixed by George Martin (and his son Giles) from the original Beatles multitracks, taking individual instruments out of context and creating new songs from the unrelated components.  I wish I could remember where I read that, because it is not strictly speaking true.<br /><br />There is one track, track 14 -- significantly the demo proof-of-concept track used to sell this compilation to the label -- where John's vocal and George's veena from \\"Within You Without You\\" are laid over the drum track from \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" -- and it works marvelously.  Unfortunately this is the only (ONLY!) track on the 26-selection album where anything new and interesting emerges.  The rest of the tracks are just old Beatle tunes, newly mixed but essentially full-length and unchanged.  Oh there are new transitions (the songs span over six years of output) and the occasional anachronistic background element thrown in and on some of the original rave-ups (like the ending to \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\") Giles has overlaid other non-tune non-time excerpts to make a denser collage, but nowhere else is the Beatles music re-thought, re-imagined or mashed up like I'd hoped.<br /><br />You'd think with modern digital tools like ProTools and access to the entire library of Beatles multitracks (both released and un-) Giles and his dad would have been inspired to create something new and startling and diabolical to shake up the moribund Beatles catalog.<br /><br />But no, we get a second Beatles \\"best of\\" collection.
B0025KVLRO|5.0|This great band provides variety by balancing Rock and Roll, R&B, shiny pop and four singers though not in equal measure. There's clear evidence here that John Lennon and Paul McCartney are catchy tunesmiths and occasionally clever lyricists. And though this doesn't contain a lousy original, the bluesy harmonica gives their U.K. debut single the needed heft to enliven its simplicity. Meanwhile, the three outstanding ones here include the high-velocity \\"I Saw Her Standing There\\", the self-revealing \\"There's A Place\\" and the gritty Mersey Pop of \\"Please Please Me\\"-and a racy number at that! Admittedly, \\"A Taste Of Honey\\" is saccharine, but they're a great covers band too. They twice revere the Shirelles and John sings for broke on a tour de force assault of the Isley Brothers smash \\"Twist And Shout\\". Their abilities are unquestionable. The energy they radiate is reason enough for the beat to take over the world.
0435123432|5.0|When I first read Flowers for Algernon some forty years ago, I was fascinated by the way Charlie, after being considered stupid his entire life, quickly became smarter and smarter, mastering increasingly difficult subjects and solving complex problems of science, math, and even linguistics. I was less interested in his emotional problems and his social difficulties. I remember the horror of realizing that he was going to lose his mental abilities and that he would be aware of what was happening to him, yet helpless to prevent it.<br /><br />I reread the story after I helped my aunt move into a nursing home five years ago. Her Alzheimer's had made it unsafe for her to live on her own or even to go out by herself. She used to be mentally sharp, loved to travel, and took a brisk walk every day. She understood what was happening to her brain and knew there was nothing that she could do about it. Even as she struggled with remembering everyday words like \\"calendar\\" and \\"TV,\\" she was remarkably philosophical about what was happening to her, explaining to her friends that that's just the way it is.<br /><br />But it had to be terribly frustrating to have your own brain let you down and to know that it would keep getting worse, and that no one could do anything to stop it. I was hesitant to read Flowers for Algernon again, afraid it would be too close to home this time. It's a fast-moving story that gets going right away. Soon I was caught up in the changes Charlie is going through and dreading the inevitable ending.<br /><br />To my surprise, the ending did not leave me feeling helpless and depressed. Although it was a shame that Charlie couldn't remain a genius, he seemed more at peace with his life in the end, and even more mature as a human being. In the story, as in real life, if you have a choice (and most of us do), you should choose to be smarter. If, on the other hand, you really no longer have a choice, there's something to be said for accepting that.
B000000HX0|5.0|I absolutely love this album.  The songs on this album have such a great ebb and flow, its one of a few albums that I truly feel can be listened to throughout, instead of like most albums from the 80s to present, where there are one or two great tracks and a bunch of mediocre ones that have no cohesion to an album as a whole.  I have the CD and vinyl version of this album, just recently picking up the vinyl.  I can not believe how great this album has stood the test of time, the single \\"today\\" was just recently used as backing music in a 2010 commercial.  Amazing album.  If you liked alternative music of the early 90s, this is one of the seminal, must have albums of that musical movement.

B003ITZBW2|3.0|Although I grew up on Robin (Dick Grayson) in the cartoons, Jason was the current Boy Wonder when I was buying comics. So I dugged the idea of a Jason Todd as Robin/Red Hood movie and hoped that his Robin years would finally be appreciated.   He got dissed when the \\"fans\\" voted him out and seem to favor Dick Grayson and Tim Drake as Robin. There's even a Dick Grayson featurette on the Special Edition. His Robin isn't even the star. Jason's Robin featurette is only available on the Blu-ray, which sucks big time. Like it or not, Batman has three \\"sons\\" (not counting Terry McGinnis), and it's time Jason gets his proper respect. This movie truly wasn't what I had hoped, but had a few okay parts. I wanted a less gory version of the Death in the Family storyline from the comics, they complied. But all the changes weren't cool. More Jason as Robin first would've been great, especially for folks unfamiliar with the storyline. I did like how bad ass Jason (Red Hood) was when battling Batman and Nightwing. But why was his Robin costume primarily red (like Tim's)in the flashbacks? Didn't Jason ware the same yellow cape, green shorts, original Robin costume that Dick wore, with minor if any changes? Tim originated the black cape, long red pants Robin costume. ONE IMPORTANT THING. The reason whey dvds aren't selling well anymore is because companies aren't packing them with nearly as much bonus content as before, and releasing 2-Disc editions with so limited an amount of content that it should be compiled onto one disc. DC/Warner's animated releases typically include the main feature (60-75 mins. long) on Disc 1 with preview or two as a bonus. HELLO, A PREVIEW IS NOT A BONUS. Disc 2 has one short documentary, a brief animated short, and two episodes from Batman or Justice League box sets that most of us already have. So it's a major rip-off. When they finaly stop putting out 2-Disc editions with only one disc worth of content and provide more actual bonus content altogether, then maybe more people will start buying instead of renting for a buck though Netflix or Redbox.
B003ES5JDS|5.0|Reading the reviews others have given, I would have to say that I agree with most of them.  Under the Red Hood is an EXCELLENT addition to the DC animated library, no question!  However, something I was VERY pleased with that doesn't seem to be getting a lot of attention is the Jonah Hex Showcase short that is included on the disk.  I'm a fan of the western and wierd western genre, so Jonah is right up my alley.  Thomas Jane provides the voice for Jonah, and I have to tell you, he really does an excellent job.  With any luck they will do a full length Jonah Hex animated movie, and Mr. Jane will reprise his role (hint hint, you folks that make this all happen!).
B00005JM20|4.0|This movie is a stupid type of funny. You will like this movie if you liked Mr.Bean the movie or Mr. Bean the tv show.
B001HN6940|4.0|When my copy of Alice in Wonderland BD arrived I was very keen to see how good the movie looked in bluray, and well it was an excellent adventure that more than lived up to the original story. Being a Diney production the special fx are most entertaining and the plot becomes quickly engaging. While some of the characters are quite mad, like Johnny Deep's Mad Hatter, Alice's journey is highlighted by overcoming all odds to save Wonderland, and in the end realize things about her own reality. Quite a worthwhile bluray to add to one's collection, the visual imagery at times is quite psychedlic and mind bendingly good.
0143118420|3.0|Wanted to read the whole thing before I see the movie with Julia Roberts.  Good read when not sitting with grandkids
1416550550|3.0|This isn't a bad novel.  It's readable and salacious with plot twists and jumps in time...the problem is, that if you've read The Thirteenth Tale (which was published first) you can basically predict the entire story because they are basically the same book.  I'm not saying this was done intentionally, it's just that the similarities are strong.    My case [SPOILER]:  A young woman investigates the past of an elderly woman only to discover a history of unknown/unclear identity.  Said young woman travels to a lonely town in England to investigate a mysterious house and legacy.  Young woman discovers that an elderly woman once had a sibling that died tragically.  Young woman discovers that elderly woman is the decendant of a wealthy aristocrat and a poorer woman.  Somehow this all ties into one of the character's ability to tell and create stories.  Siblings are involved.  Incest is involved.  Death at an early age, soon after one of the characters becomes a mother is involved. Did I mention the secret garden/area that is supposed to be off-limits? I didn't? Well, that's the same don't-go-there plot twist too.      Like The Thirteenth Tale, this is a good stab at modern gothic romance...it's just that it's pretty much the same stab.  If you can ignore that - read on.  I just couldn't, and it kind of annoyed me the whole way through the novel.
B003OF3R0S|5.0|Once again my 7 year old son gets to see his 38 year old dad air guitar like a teenager.  Bad ass delivered again as usual.  Highly recommended.  There are a few slower songs I don't care for too much.  Not that I have anything against slower songs, its just not what I buy Avenged Sevenfold for.  The good stuff makes the album well worth the price of admission.

0307454541|5.0|I usually don't read thrillers, but after hearing the hype surrounding this book I decided to give it a go.  I was not disappointed.  I will admit that it took me a little time to get into it, but once I did I was totally hooked.  I finished the bulk of it in 2 days because I was so engrossed in the story.  I would definitely recommend this book!  I just purchased the 2nd one and have high hopes for it!
B002SQ3664|5.0|I love this movie. As soon as I saw it I knew I had to have my own copy. I love how the movie shows the behind the scenes view of what took place to bring Woodstock to life. I think the actors were brilliant. All the different kinds of characters were great. If you were old enough to remember when Woodstock happened, you will want to see this film. If you weren't, you will want to see what the fuss was all about. There will never be another Woodstock. It was a one time thing. This movie makes it possible for all of us to experience a little part of it.
B002VPE1B6|1.0|The movie is great, but the distribution has none of the customary extras: none, zero, nada, nothing.  I hear they are going to have another release in November with some extras, so this release is just a marketing trick.  I suggest waiting for the full edition.
B001VS46DC|5.0|This lovely expression of the goodness inherent in music is a wonderful experience and will reaffirm for those who care that here is something to be proud of as we slowly but surely destroy our mother earth. The production is top notch from beginning to end peopled with natural sights that are breathtaking, performers whose talents are obvious, and music, the universal language, which weaves itself into, for all those in attendance and those who are lucky enough to view this offering,  our hearts and minds.     There is a selection where Diana invites the audience to join her in song in a dimly lite hall with people sitting at tables lighted magically by candle light(?). They begin faintly at first but join together, delicately, in their beautiful native language with a sensitivity and love that just might bring on an emotional response as you join with them in spirit. (For those of you who might say,\\"What is this?...Sappy? No way...check it out for yourself.) Diana's side musicians, along with the orchestra, complement her talent with theirs and give us, for a period of time, their artistic gifts for which I believe you will be grateful.... You will be touched.
0802130208|5.0|It seems that half the reviews of this book together form a collective discussion of whether the book is \\"funny\\" or not.  This argument misses the point.  While the book is darkly humorous, that alone wouldn't make it a great book, which it is.    The simple fact is that this is a fantastic, American novel.  It deals with the classic American themes of freedoms, race, ambition, and self-definition.  It rises above exploiting stereotypes and actually explores them.  It adds something to psychology instead of haphazardly and incoherently borrowing from it, as so many other novels do.    Don't read this book \\"because it's funny;\\"  Read it because it is a great book.

B002JCSWV6|3.0|I really was looking forward to seeing this film.  Rugby as a mechanism for healing racial and political divisions in South Africa.  Go team!  But...<br /><br />Both Morgan Freeman and Matt Damon failed to make their characters come alive as significant players in this particular story.  And most importantly, Clint Eastwood didn't make me believe that this particular rugby team had a healing effect on the nation.  And isn't this what the film was about?<br /><br />I hoped for more...

0399156577|5.0|Nora received some negative reviews for \\"The Search\\" and I'm not surprised. She's spent the last twenty five years writing genre fiction. While there's nothing at all wrong with writing genre fiction and Nora writes it wonderfully well, genre fiction, is, by definition, eminently predictable and highly formulaic. Not so with \\"The Search\\" and the reason is obvious. \\"The Search\\" isn't genre fiction; it's a novel.    \\"The Search\\" is a good novel. The writing is first-rate, the plot is well-crafted, the characters are complex and multi-faceted. There's a lot of show and not much tell. It's atmospheric and descriptive, an easy world to enter and accept. The characters are credible and Simon -abrupt, taciturn, moody Simon- shows just how good a writer Nora is. He could so easily have slipped into unlikeable, obnoxious, in less capable hands. Yes, it does start slowly. Yes. It meanders more than Nora's books usually do.    These are not flaws. It's a good read.

0307454541|1.0|I'm another Constant Reader who just didn't \\"get\\" this book.  I bought it when it was first published in the US, not during the recent hype, and I was encouraged to buy it initially because of its popularity in Sweden.  It sounded like it would be a good read.  I started the book and only made it through a few chapters when I decided that I didn't need to waste my time on something that wasn't enlightening or compelling.  I'm not saying I have to have everything \\"spoon-fed\\" to me; I've read my share of books where I've spent vast sections wading through prose.  Hell, I've read \\"Atlas Shrugged,\\" for crying out loud. Talk about wading through prose.  I've had this book a few years and since it's become extremely popular and there are two additional books now, I'm going to give it another try.  Perhaps I'll write a different review in six months.
B003ITZBVI|4.0|Great story line.  the only drawback I had  with the movie Is that I am a huge Joker fan and the actor they chose didn't do as great of a job as Mark Hamill dose, this actor did very well, however at times I felt his portrayal of the joker wasn't as deranged as it should have been i felt the joker should have enjoyed the beginning scene much much more than he did the beginning scene should have shown the joker having some serious fun but Ihe just seemed less sick to me. the joker just didn't seemed sick enough at times. although the final scene with the joker was very good and made up for some of the scenes i was disappointed in. I don't know why they chose a different cast, I suppose to differentiate this story line from the animated series and other films with that cast, but I enjoyed the film its awesome. I would have enjoyed it more if mark Hamill was in it. I would recommend it to any fan (way better than Gotham knight) If your a batman fan you will definitely enjoy this movie its worth getting.
B0021L8V0W|3.0|If one female can bring in the summer action fare, it's Angelina Jolie. 2 years ago we got \\"Wanted\\", where she played the smokin' hot Fox (her name certainly is right), the smart and super-tattooed female who leads poor, depressed Wesley to a clan of assassins called The Fraternity. Now 2 years later, she returns with \\"Salt\\", which, as you could tell from the trailer, is your typical summer action flick. So if you're expecting anything deep like \\"Inception\\", do be prepared to be disappointed. But if you're like me, asking for just a summer action flick, then you'll be satisfied.<br /><br />Evelyn Salt works in a cubicle in a CIA-owned office building. It's her anniversary day, and she is trying to figure out a perfect way to hold her anniversary dinner with her arachnid-fascinated husband Mike. She is called to interrogate a mysterious Russian man when she finds herself in two troublesome situations: 1) Rumor is spreading that she is working with Russian Intelligence and 2) In 24 hours, the Russian president will be assassinated by a Russian spy upon giving a Eulogy at the Vice President of the USA's funeral. She must prove her innocence from this accusation, as well as stop this spy from assassinating the Russian president.<br /><br />So yeah, a typical summer fare plot. Obviously you know that half the movie will just be Angelina beating guys up, and this film does not disappoint in that aspect. Action-wise, this film has some great action scenes, including a particularly exciting car chase that involves Angelina jumping from truck to truck. Her stunt work is quite impressive too, and it has some of her best stunts she's performed since the Tomb Raider movies. She is in great shape evidently, and so therefore her action scene work is quite fun to watch. Acting wise, she really can act, and she shows it well enough here.<br /><br />So yeah, it's fun and all. Good twist near the end makes it worth it as well. So why 2.5 stars? Because really, this film is like a fast food hamburger. Enjoyable while consumed, yet after, you're left with a lingering stomach ache. After the film, you're left wondering why you watched it, just like after you finish eating a fast food burger, you're left wondering why you ate it, despite the enjoyment you got out of it.<br /><br />In short, It's worth it while it lasts, and that's mainly it.ble while consumed, yet after, you're left with a lingering stomach ache.

1594744475|4.0|I fell in love with the idea of Yum-Yum Bento Box, even if I'd never dream of attempting some of the things inside it, although the same could be said for many cookbooks. Unlike most cookbooks, however, just looking at the cover makes me happy! Happy frogs, precious little chicks, an octopus with eyelashes that must be Maybelline, and a little pink thing I think is a lamb (or pig?)... who doesn't love that!?!<br /><br />While American kids express themselves through the design or characters on the outside of their lunch boxes, in Japan, Bento - Japanese for \\"boxed lunches\\" - are all about what's inside the box - well as an expression of love from mother to child. (I'm not saying that kids with better bento are more loved, but...) Of course bento isn't just for kids, but you may feel like a kid if you open your lunch box to find a field of smiling faces made from fruit, veggies, sandwiches and other assorted (healthy) lunch foods. And what's wrong with that? (Hint: nothing!)<br /><br />Aside from being adorably cute, however, the small dishes encourage portion control, while also making food more appetizing, and encouraging thought. (Do I really want to eat that smiling mushroom?) The book provides info on the tools you'll need to make all of the creations featured in Yum-Yum Bento Box (more than 50 complete bento), which are divided into three sections, Cuties and Critters, Fairy-Tale Friends, and Special Day Treats. It's not only a super cute book your friends will want to borrow, it's also fascinating to read, and full of fun things to do!

Every year a boy and a girl from each district is chosen to participate in the Hunger Games, where they fight and kill down to the last person standing. This year Katniss is going as a tribute from District 12 and she's rather determined to win.<br /><br />WITH (minor) SPOILERS!<br /><br />Thoughts: I was a little leery of this because I'm not the biggest dystopian fan and it sounded super violent. Plus it was super popular-what if it was another Twilight (Note: I am largely anti-Twilight because it is crap, crap, crap).<br /><br />Now Katniss doesn't really have any female friends but she's close to her sister and fiercely protective of her family, which I love. As an older sister, I like to think that I would be able to protect my sister even if I can't shoot arrows as well as Katniss. I also loved the secondary characters, especially Cinna and Haymitch, two of the people helping Katniss during the Games. They're funny and she interacted in interesting ways with them.<br /><br />There was some predictability. It was pretty obvious who would be the last to die, when Rue would die, and a bit of the love story but it didn't detract from my enjoyment.<br /><br />Team: This is the big question so...Peeta! He's been in love with her for eleven years; person secretly in love with another for ages is one of my favorite romantic tropes. While Gale may be in a similar position, he didn't take the opportunity to express it. It also helps that in Forever Young Adult's handy dissections of the series, Peeta is represented by William Moseley and Gale by Ethan Peck; Um King Peter FTW! (Actually I really love their review so check that out too)<br /><br />Overall: Outstanding dystopian with generous dollops of romance-highly recommended!<br /><br />Predictions: Keeping in mind that I've mostly avoided spoilers for the next two books, these are some of the things I'm thinking: Katniss will lead a rebellion against the Capitol, culminating in Mockingjay; the relationship between her and Peeta and her and Gale will end in a permanent relationship of her with one of them; I am also hoping that Katniss doesn't die.mance-highly recommended!

0307346617|5.0|EDIT: I'm back on Amazon to buy another copy of this book. My first one now sits in a well-deserved place on my shelf, held together with packing tape and a rubber band. I cannot express how much I love this book. I can pick it up at any time, open it to any page, and start reading. I'm even planning a trip to Tampa Florida to have the author sign my copy. This book is everything that I, a child of the 21st century, Dawn of the Dead remake, Zombie apocalypse era could ever expect or want. I had high expectations for this book and it surpassed them all.    I have been wanting this book for years now, pretty much since it's release. But for one reason or another, I never got around to it. Max Brooks weaves a believable tale using the first hand 'accounts' of people who lived through Wold War Z. The facts, such as locations and terrain, military specifics, ect. are all very well researched and add a feel of authenticity to this novel. Even if you're not a HUGE fan of zombies like I am, this book is still a very good read. I would recommend this book to anyone needing something to read that's going to keep them entertained. It pulled me all the way from the Introduction to the final pages of 'Good-Byes'. Highly Recommened.
0439023491|5.0|Catching Fire by Suzanne Collins<br />Scholastic, 2009<br />391 pages<br />Dystopian; YA<br />Second in series<br />5/5 stars<br /><br />Warning: Spoilers!<br /><br />Summary: Katniss has managed to survive the Hunger Games but while outwardly things look much the same, around the country, the districts are in turmoil. Her relationships are also fractured: her feelings toward Gale and Peeta are confusing and she's confused about her place between the Capitol and rebellion. When Katniss is called back to the arena, the stage is set for an uprising.<br /><br />Thoughts: It was really easy to jump back in to Katniss's world, probably because I just finished The Hunger Games. It was pretty slow at the beginning as Katniss tries to sort things out: how she feels about Gale and Peeta; how she feels about rebellion; what she's going to do. Then she gets word that she's going back to the arena to serve as another tribute. It really picked up after going in to the arena-I sped through it! Trying to figure out what the Gamekeepers might have dreamed up to torture the tributes and then clutching at my chest as she scrambled to get out-it was very intense!<br /><br />Team: I still like Peeta even if she wants to stupidly remain in love with like the first guy she ever met. Peeta bakes! And he sounds adorable! Whereas Gale hunts and he sounds kind of ugly.<br /><br />Overall: Even more gripping than the first book, Catching Fire ends with a bang to send us right in to Mockingjay!<br /><br />Cover: I like the black of the first book more but this fits with the series.

B003ITZBW2|3.0|I agree with most reviewers that this movie is not for kids.  This is mainly due to the violence.  In this movie characters actually get shot and die.  Plus there is a pretty violent beating scene for a cartoon.<br /><br />Plot:  The overall plot was good, nothing special though.  There were no twists or mystery and everything was pretty predictable<br /><br />Characters:  All the characters were done well and so was the dialogue.  My only complaint is the Joker.  Mark Hammil is NOT the voice of the Joker in this movie.  This is a shame.  I believe the directors were trying to make this joker more like the one in the \\"Dark Knight\\" movie.  This doesn't relay well in an animated feature.  Plus if you bought this movie, its probably because you are a fan of the animated series.  Not having the original character voice is a disappointment.
B002VKE1K2|4.0|I love a horror movie that does not rely on just gore, and the same old tricks. This was very much like Blair Witch, but I liked Blair Witch. I loved it, and was creeped out.
B0030ZOYJ0|1.0|This review is from someone who knows nothing about the series and has never seen it.<br /><br />Yes, the movie is visually stunning and that's where it stops.<br /><br />I enjoy anime and every now and then purchase something new I have never heard of, in hopes to find a great new series.  Well this isn't it.  This movie is purely for people that are long time fans and have watched the entire series.<br /><br />First off, I thought it was a stand alone movie.  Apparently I was wrong and this is merely an introduction.  An introduction filled with NO back history, annoying characters and plot holes.  There are these things called Angles and they are attacking the Earth.  You don't know why they are attacking, what they are exactly, where they came from or anything!  Then the \\"hero\\" of the series is a whiny 14yr old boy who pilots a giant \\"cyborg\\" type robot.  Do we know anything about the boy?  Why he was selected to pilot, how he had the ability to pilot without ever training or ANYTHING besides the fact that he cries the entire movie.....NOPE.  Plus there is no need for the nudity.  Its not that it \\"bothers\\" me, it just seems completely irrelevant and out of place.  Not to mention it usually occurs between a brother and sister, that are 14yrs old.  Does anyone else get the feeling that this is the culmination of some perverts fantasy?  14yr old incest....yeah I think I'll pass.<br /><br />After watching this and now knowing its an introduction, I still have no interest in watching the series.  I'm just going to go over to Wikipedia and read up on it to fill in all the plot gaps.<br /><br />However, if you find a 14yr old whiny character, who want to bone his sister, cry about piloting a giant robot and suffers from neglect and daddy issues then this is YOUR movie.
B002XB0AC2|5.0|Pros: Sturdy construction and good use of rubbery PVC plastic. Lots of articulation.    Cons: Doesn't scale well with the older play arts figures due to larger size.
0307454541|1.0|I decided to read this because of all the hype, but what a disappointment.  Really mediocre writing style with half-baked characters, and full of gratuitously disgusting episodes.  I love the fact that he puts seemingly female-sympathetic statistics at the beginning of chapters (e.g. \\"Thirteen percent of the women in Sweden have been subjected to aggravated sexual assault\\") then proceeds to give us numerous Hannibal Lecter-esque episodes.  Yuck.  I think the only reason this book caught on was because of the Asperger's suffering female lead.  Not nearly enough to save it in my book.
B003HKN51Q|2.0|I had the opportunity to view \\"Elvis on Tour\\" theatrical release on July 30th, it was great to see the King on the big screen, and I have also pre-ordered the blu-ray version here on Amazon but after seeing the theatrical release my hopes of WB doing anything good with this film has torpedo all my expectations.  They have altered the original film mainly the opening credits replacing the opening audio of \\"Johnny B Goode\\" exchanged it with \\"Don't Be Cruel\\".  I should be happy that it has been transferred to blu-ray, but I have no idea of the quality of the transfer until I receive it from Amazon.  The bonus video showed before the feature film was not very good, WB and Elvis enterprises is sitting on hours upon hours of video never before seen before, what are they thinking?  Can money still be made if they let decades go by before re-releasing?  Will it be altered and censored so we view only what they want us to see?  We have seen Elvis at his best and his worse, we are big boys and girls, I think we can take Elvis at any point of his life because he was just that great and gifted of an entertainer.  Where is my bonus material?  If anyone has an idea how to make these companies involved with Elvis rethink ideology other than stop buying the scraps they throw at us, I am all ears.

B001C4CI8U|5.0|This has got to be one of the best shows on television. The writing is excellent and you never know what little quip Walter will come up with. This purchase was a gift for a fellow Fringe fanatic like myself. I ordered it when I pre-ordered Season 2 which I can't wait to get in September. I have watched Season 1 several times now and the season opener still grabs my attention. The last disc, especially the last show, is my favorite. I definitely would encourage everyone to watch the special features on each disc.
B001NLKT60|5.0|This is the second book in the Millennium Trilogy by Stieg Larrson. I read the first book and thought it was quite good and I just finished this, the second book. It was even better then the first. I am glad I purchased all three books and started with the first one because I got to know and understand the characters that continued into the second book. I can't praise this book enough. I am about to start reading the third and final installment of the Trilogy and look forward to another terrific read.
B000025XE5|3.0|One can't fault the song selection on this collection.  The A and B-sides are presented in chronological order.  There are many great \\"proto-punk\\" classics on this collection.  Iggy Pop cited them as a major influence on the Stooges.  However, the sound quality and liner notes leave something to be desired.  I would love to hear this collection remastered from original source tapes.  I would also like to see more information in the liner notes such as recording dates, release dates, personnel, etc.  However, the song selection makes this worth having if you are a casual fan of the group.
0307394549|5.0|Amazing book, it includes a nice number of recipes, each one with at least a picture showing the way it should end up.

You won't regret getting this one.
B002N8A14M|4.0|I like this product a lot.  It is stylish and protective. I do, however,  wish they would sell it without the armband at a reduced price.  The major issue is that the opening at the base of the cover prevents full insertion of the charger/synch cable, so it must be removed before performing these operations.  It also blocks insertion of the connector on certain headphone models with a broad plug.

B0009DXFBY|2.0|This movie would get a top rating if not for the tape itself.<br /><br />This STAR CLASSICS dub of Frank Capra's IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE was one of the first videotapes I ever bought, way back in 1986. A budget-priced item that comes in an oversized cardboard box with tucked-in flaps at top and bottom, it's a slow speed transfer of only middling quality. There's no HiFi audio track, only a linear one. The film itself is unrestored and has a less than pristine picture.<br /><br />Although now a perennial holiday favorite, in first run \\"Wonderful Life\\" failed to earn back its $3.7 million cost.<br /><br />Shortly after its release, the FBI cited this movie's anti-banker plotline as a common ploy used by Communists. There may be some truth here, for the story was partly scripted by Dalton Trumbo, playwright Clifford Odets and poet/critic Dorothy Parker. All three were investigated for possible Communist activities. Trumbo and Parker were both blacklisted. Odets avoided the same fate by cooperatively naming his \\"fellow travelers.\\"<br /><br />SYNOPSIS--<br />After a large sum of his customers' money is inadvertantly lost, businessman George Bailey (Stewart) attempts suicide by jumping off a bridge into an icy river. He's rescued by an angel named Clarence (Travers). In a clever variation of Dickens' Christmas spirits visiting Scrooge, Clarence shows the despairing man how the townspeople of Bedford Falls would be far worse off if George Bailey never existed.<br /><br />\\"It's a Wonderful Life\\" is also available on [[ASIN:B000VDDDVO DVD]]. (Includes the colorized version.)<br /><br />Related item:<br />A year after this picture, Cary Grant, Loretta Young and David Niven starred in THE BISHOP'S WIFE. Here, Grant is angel Dudley, come to help Bishop Brougham and his wife Julia. Unlike Capra's often dark tale, this one's consistently light and charming. One of Cary Grant's best movies.

World Wide Infertility  Government Sponsored Terror  A small glimmer of hope lies in one woman and a hapless hero.    OK - there were moments in the movie that I thought \\"What a great movie!\\" and there were just as many where I thought \\"UG, when is this going to get to the point?\\". Michael Cane did a good job with his role but, the role was a poorly written stereotyped pot smoking, beatles loving, long haired hippie. Yawn.

0486477436|5.0|One of the Dashwood daughters is smart, down-to-earth and sensible. The other is wildly romantic and sensitive.<br /><br />And in a Jane Austen novel, you can guess that there are going to be romantic problems aplenty for both of them -- along with the usual entailment issues, love triangles, sexy bad boys and societal scandals. \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is a quietly clever, romantic little novel that builds up to a dramatic peak on Marianne's romantic troubles, while also quietly exploring Elinor's struggles.<br /><br />When Mr. Dashwood dies, his entire estate is entailed to his weak son John and snotty daughter-in-law Fanny. His widow and her three daughters are left with little money and no home.<br /><br />Over the next few weeks, the eldest daughter Elinor begins to fall for Fanny's studious, quiet brother Edward... but being the down-to-earth one, she knows she hasn't got a chance. Her impoverished family soon relocates to Devonshire, where a tiny cottage is being rented to them by one of Mrs. Dashwood's relatives -- and Marianne soon attracts the attention of two men. One is the quiet, much older Colonel Brandon, and the other is the dashing and romantic Willoughby.<br /><br />But things begin to spiral out of control when Willoughby seems about to propose to Marianne... only to abruptly break off his relationship with her. And during a trip to London, both Elinor and Marianne discover devastating facts about the men they are in love with -- both of them are engaged to other women. And after disaster strikes the Dashwood family, both the sisters will discover what real love is about...<br /><br />At its heart, \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is about two girls with completely opposite personalities, and the struggle to find love when you're either too romantic or too reserved for your own good. As well as, you know, the often-explored themes in Austen's novels -- impoverished women's search for love and marriage, entailment, mild scandal, and the perils of falling for a sexy bad boy who cares more for money than for true love... assuming he even knows what true love is.<br /><br />Austen's formal style takes on a somewhat more melancholy flavor in this book, with lots of powerful emotions and vivid splashes of prose (\\"The wind roared round the house, and the rain beat against the windows\\"); and she introduces a darker tone near the end. Still, there's a slight humorous tinge to her writing, especially when she's gently mocking Marianne and Mrs. Dashwood's melodrama (\\"They gave themselves up wholly to their sorrow, seeking increase of wretchedness in every reflection that could afford it\\").<br /><br />And Marianne and Elinor make excellent dual heroines for this book -- that still love and cherish each other, even though their polar opposite personalities frequently clash. What's more, they each have to become more like the other before they can find happiness. There's also a small but solid supporting cast -- the hunting-obsessed Sir John, the charming Willoughby (who has some nasty stuff in his past), the emotional Mrs. Dashwood, and the gentle, quiet Colonel Brandon, who shows his love for Marianne in a thousand small ways.<br /><br />\\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is an emotionally powerful, beautifully written tale about two very different sisters, and the rocky road to finding a lasting love. Not as striking as \\"Pride and Prejudice,\\" but still a deserving classic.a sexy bad boy who cares more for money than for true love... assuming he even knows what true love is.<br /><br />Austen's formal style takes on a somewhat more melancholy flavor in this book, with lots of powerful emotions and vivid splashes of prose (\\"The wind roared round the house, and the rain beat against the windows\\"); and she introduces a darker tone near the end.

0385737947|5.0|Enjoyable slow paced book that we listened to on a very very long car trip.  The children ages 7 - 13 were absolutely captivated and demanded to turn it on and turn it up as soon as we'd pile back in the van.  As we dropped each child off at their homes (We were delivering kids from summer camp), each child begged us to call and tell them how the book ended.<br /><br />I spoke to the moms, and they assured their kids that they were making a trip to the book store and/or the library to pick up the Maze Runner so their child could know the ending.  The moms were thrilled that their kids were finally interested in reading.<br /><br />As an adult, I found the book fun but a tad slow in action.  It's a mysterious/sad story and I think the age of the reader of this book should be adjusted to encompass ages 10 - 15.
B003UYUQZW|1.0|Despite my distaste for Jerry Bruckheimer, I actually didn't think this film looked too bad. I like Jake Gyllenhaal and I knew he had the acting chops to bring this epic video game adaptation to life. However, I'm not sure what Gyllenhaal was doing during this movie, but it certainly wasn't acting. Both him and Gemma Arterton failed to unite any sparks to carry the movie through the dull patches (and believe me, there are lots of those), and Ben Kingsley plays one of the most unconvincing villains I have seen in awhile. To me, this film seemed like the \\"Pirates of the Carribbean\\" films, but without the wit or charm of Johnny Depp's immortal Captain Jack Sparrow. If you ever wondered what it would be like if \\"Pirates\\" didn't have Depp to stir things up between the lifeless relationship between dull Will Turner and boring Elizabeth Swan, see \\"Prince of Persia\\" and you'll see it for what it is: Pure torture.

B002LYTNR4|3.0|The information is very powerful, unfortunately the presentation is cumbersome.  Each CD is only 2 tracks and each track is 20-45 minutes each.  And yet the book is a series of questions and answers.  They should have made each question a track.  It doesn't cost anything extra and it would make the entire CD experience worthy of the material he presents.    Also, the book is read by the author. And I must say his thick German accent and extremely monotone voice make it very challenging to listen to this audio program, particularly in the car. I know it is wonderful when the author reads his work, but that's only when he has a good speaking voice.  Echart Tolle does not.  Tolle should have read the introduction, and then a professional reader should have taken over.

B001MYIXAC|5.0|I do not look out for art, but you find it right there. The scene, the composition of light and the choice of actors are a piece of perfection.<br />Believe me, it is. I first read the book and was prepared for changes to the worse here and there, but even if i try hard, i cannot rightly complain. Partly subtle in movement and direct in words, the story is still told the same and is great to enjoy. The play on Eli's last secret is not included and holds a nice surprise for anybody who reads the books....and yet a chapter more of horror.<br /><br />The vampire is not the monster, it is human against its nature<br />The humans are monsters. And it seems to be their nature. The truth about our own nature sets us right into the middle of self-produced filth and misery
B001U7WUW8|5.0|I've had this album in three inceptions now.    1. A cassette which I wore out listening to so much  2. A CD to replace the worn out cassette  3. This vinyl pressing.    I have to say that this is the best one. Of course, you can't really  beat vinyl. I do agree that the vocals are much richer and more crisp. This album is one of the best I've owned as far as music goes in general. Having a actual vinyl copy makes me appreciate it even more than I already did. Having listened to Dookie since it's release I have to say that I'm more then happy that I picked up this version of it. It's nice to fall in love all over again.

141690977X|4.0|First I would like to say that I did see the movie and it lit a bulb for me so i decided to go ahead and read the book. The book pretty much states the same advice as the movie \\"if a guy is into you he will make it happen\\". One part that was very true in the movie but wasn't as touched upon in the book was how women all get together and make excuses for the guy who is not acting as he should which is VERY TRUE especially among younger women.   I would say that the book is a pretty good light read. Yes a lot of this stuff is common sense such as don't date someone who is married or who cheats on you but you'd be surprised how often women don't use those bits of common sense and I felt because they were written out in front of you they are much easier to confront head on and hopefully think about. That being said I liked the way they wrote together with Greg writing the general rules and liz answering them as a single woman and how she might feel on the topic. This book also included q and A with greg as well as a after you finish this book list of stages with liz.   In my opinion, the great thing about this book is that you can think about the guy you have in mind or past boyfriends or relationships and think about how they were in each category that he lists. Hopefully it leads to honest answers about them and maybe you'll realize that if he's dating you and he really doesn't call that much then he might really not be into you. Yes sometimes he oversimplified situations like men will always make it happen. As much as i would like to believe it to be true I know men are also afraid of rejection so they might need a little nudge.     Overall I enjoyed this book. It was a quick and easy read and it forced me to look at my own relationships. Enjoy :)

B0000UJL96|5.0|I am a fan of the original Star Trek series, and the six movies that featured the original crew.  The even-numbered movies were the best; Wrath of Khan, Voyage Home, and this one, the Undiscovered Country.  Not only is the movie exciting and well done, but it brings the history of the original crew to a satisfying conclusion.  I love this movie.  In fact, I already owned it on VHS, but wanted it on DVD to survive the progress of technology.
B002VECMAE|1.0|The trailers were tantalizing, the list of stars was intriguing, the movie itself challenged my Dyson Vacuum in it sucking quality. Need I say more?

I can not figure out why in anyone's name did George Clooney make this movie?
B001HN69AY|5.0|This was my first time using Amazon.com Video On Demand. It is very simple to use. Find a movie that you want to watch now in the Video On Demand category. Choose and click on \\"want to rent\\". This will take you to the License Agreement which you must agree to. Then to the \\"bill to...\\" section just like you are purchasing something from Amazon. Use your bank account or gift card/ promotional balance. You will then be taken back to the black screen to choose if you want to see it now or within the next 24 hours.<br />  I chose The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus (2009) because I like the versitle performances of Heath Ledger. He was so different in every movie he does. Since Doctor Parnassus is the last film he was working on at the time of his unexpected death, January 22, 2008, I just had to see it. Plus I like fantasy movies that take you to a dream-like place of the strange and bizarre, a la [[ASIN:B002DYYGQK The Wizard of Oz (70th Anniversary Two-Disc Special Edition)]] (1939), [[ASIN:B000LC4ZE4 Blue Bird]] (1940)[[ASIN:B0030U1TFW Alice in Wonderland]] (1933), [[ASIN:B001HN694K Alice in Wonderland]] (2010).<br />  I had no problems with Video On Demand. I could even put it on Full Screen. Periodically, I had to move my mouse so that my monitor did not go into a black screen sleep stage, but it does not interupt the movie.<br />  Once you begin Video On Demand, you can not stop the movie.

B000Y7U98C|3.0|I won't write a long review considering how much has already been written about this film. In terms of its science as well as the sometimes nonsensical plot twists, particularly near the end, the film is certainly very flawed, but it still managed to hold my interest for nearly two hours, which is more than I can say for most science fiction films these days. For those who like cinematic SF, Boyle's sources for the film are quite obvious: influences from \\"2001,\\" \\"2010,\\" \\"Dark Star\\" and \\"Alien,\\" in particular, abound. (I learned afterwards that Boyle mentioned getting inspiration from these, as well as Tarkovsky's \\"Solaris,\\" the influence of which I personally didn't notice, in interviews.) Boyle at least stole from the best. Still, it's not even a tenth as good as any of these films, but it's interesting and original enough to be worth watching. Just don't expect anything great. (SPOILERS AHEAD) I really thought that the film would have been much better if some reason for Pinbacker's murderous rage had been given. Instead we're just told that he's insane, apparently after becoming convinced that the Sun is God (although given that the aim of both Icarus missions is to save the Sun rather than destroy it, it seems odd that he wants the God he worships to die, but as with many aspects of this movie it's best not to think too deeply into it), and it's left at that. I kept hoping that we would discover that Pinbacker had learned some profound secret during his time in space that had caused him to want to let the Sun go out. But, no, in the end he's just another crazed, knife-wielding serial killer. That was probably the biggest disappointment of the film for me.
B0009RCPY8|4.0|Ok if your a fan of the ghostbusters movies than you will LOVE this package. But I have a complaint imagine if you didn't grow up in the 1980s and there talking bout classics in the 1980s. The first thing is E.T. which deserves it but what comes after that is ghostbusters. For those who don't know I just have to tell you right now Ghostbusters is not the 2nd best movie from the 80s, its not even the best movie that came out in 1984 both Temple of Doom and Gremlins are way better made films. I just feel like it was rushed espessily at the end and I wish it was a little bit longer lets say by 30 minutes. They didn't talk bout the ghosts but more bout just saving the city which is fine but at that time it was so unoriginal. Now I know what your thinking if you don't think saving the city is important than why do you love gremlins. My answer is cause Gremlins is different in Gremlins you learn bout the Gremlins before they attack and everybody as to agree you don't get that in Ghostbusters. You know maybe being born in 1989 didn't help either but all I am saying is that you really had to live back in 1984 to appreciate it cause if your born any later than it isn't going to be funny. Do I think its a bad film no i don't but it is certainly not E.T., Raiders of the lost ark or Back to the future like everybody says. But for those who like ghostbusters this is the best deal you can get but for those who have never seen Ghostbusters i recommend renting it first.
B002ZG994U|5.0|The A-Team  When I heard that they were going to shoot the movie I said: Oh my God I hope Hollywood does not spoil everything... and guess what? I was completely wrong!!!      A-Team it´s definitely a great movie! I was a little skeptical about this movie because I thought it was very difficult to shoot a the A-Team film.    I thought it was very difficult to find the perfect actors for the film... but they did it... they found them. The whole group of actors is excellent!    The film is also a tribute to the original television series, is full of details that make a classic film but modern at the same time. For example: now we all know how they met, why B.A. is afraid to fly and uses that hairstyle and how the TV series begins.    I think they did an incredible job with the characters and perfectly adapted them to modern times.    If you liked the series I guarantee you will love this movie!  Great plot, great actors, great performances, great visuals, great action!! In other words, The A team is a film that you can not miss!!    A MUST SEEN MOVIE!!!!!!

B002ZG980U|4.0|This is a movie that grew on me as I watched it. The first part was slow and almost incomprehensible to me; I seriously thought of walking out of the theater. But as the sponsor of the \\"dream team,\\" Saito, began to make clear what he really wanted--the breakup of a competitor's business empire, the movie gains clarity and focus and begins to move ahead with great energy.<br /><br />The first issue is keeping the cast members in mind. The \\"team\\" developed by protagonist Cobb (played by Leonardo DiCaprio) includes an array of professionals--an architect (Ariadne, played by Ellen Page), Eames (played by Tom Hardy), Yusuf (a chemist who develops sedatives to facilitate the dream process--especially if there are dreams within dreams [the movie, at one point, goes four dreams deep]), and Arthur. The normal goal of Cobb and his partners is \\"extraction,\\" getting information through entering dreams--and even manipulating dreams. In this case, Saito wants \\"inception,\\" introducing an idea into the mind of his competitor, Robert Fischer, son of Maurice, who had developed a business empire that threatens to overwhelm Saito's concerns. The idea would lead Robert to dismantle his father's empire and allow greater competitive room for Saito (at the beginning, needless to say, this and other threads are hard to keep in mind).<br /><br />Then, they build the scheme--to function at three levels. The top dream involves a chase; the next layer occurs in a hotel room; the third layer in a winter wilderness. Violence occurs at each level as \\"projections\\" from Fischer's mind emerge in the dreams. And, making the schemes developed by Cobb's team more difficult, his wife, Mal, who had killed herself believing that she was still in a dream, shows up as a projection in his \\"capers.\\" No different in this effort, and she adds an element of unpredictability and danger.<br /><br />As the movie begins to gather momentum after a slow start, the characters make this plot \\"work.\\" The action is nonstop. Some suggest that this is a cerebral, deep movie. I'm not sure that I agree. It is an action movie, based on an interesting concept about dreams. One other plus: an appearance by the redoubtable Michael Caine as Ariadne's college teacher and Cobb's father-in-law.<br /><br />If one can be patient until things begin to clarify, this will be a worthwhile movie to attend and reflect upon.is a cerebral, deep movie.

0765322889|3.0|I am a huge fan of Donaldson's Covenant books, and when I saw Donaldson's recommendation, I said, \\"Wow!\\" and opened the book to take a look.    Like another reviewer said, I am a very impatient reader. If you haven't gained my interested on the first page, I won't read your book. And if you haven't captured my interest by the end of the first chapter, I will stop reading. I say that to point out that I read the first three and a half books of Erikson's Malazan Book of the Fallen. That says something. I love the way he writes. He is very descriptive, his characters are exceptional, and he has nearly everything that you would want in a story.     That \\"nearly\\" is important for me, however. After three and a half books, I could not tell you what the story was about. I need plot, and Erikson doesn't offer one. Each book has something of a plot. There are things the characters are doing, places they are going, reasons for going there and doing what they do. But there is no connection. Nothing that ties everything together.  It is a series of books that seemingly have no point other than to describe the day to day experiences of the people, the day to day events that take place. But there is no \\"point\\" to the story. While his style may be \\"realistic\\", I don't want that much realism. A film that shows nothing but birds eating food on the ground would be realistic. It is exactly what is taking place in the real world. But it would be an incredibly boring film. Malazan Book of the Fallen is, to Erikson's credit, not boring. It's just pointless. And after three and a half books, I got tired of trying to figure out why I was reading this and where it was going.    One person's comment on a previous review said that if you give it time, all the side plots start to be tied together. I grant that is a possibility, and I saw glimmers of that in the first three books. But every time I thought to myself, \\"Ah! THAT is where we're going.\\" We went off somewhere else, and it seemed I was wrong.    I read somewhere (can't find it now) where Erikson says that the books were inspired by Napoleon's \\"Book of the Fallen\\", which was a list of those who died in his campaigns. Erikson said, if I recall correctly, that he wondered about the experiences behind the names. The series reads like that. It reads like a series of characters who each do \\"their own thing\\" without much connection to one another. If, as the commentator above suggests, these events all do tie together later, then Erikson waits too long to begin bringing the story into focus. I am not willing to wait 8 books to figure out what the main story is.    The fact that I got three and a half books into the series speaks to Erikson's immense talent as a writer. The fact that I put the series down after three and a half books speaks to his shortcomings as a story-teller.

B002BU0DPE|5.0|I ordered my PX21's in June and received them in about 4 days with the cheapest shipping method. Out of the box I had problems connecting my mic so it would work with the Xbox but it turned out to be my controller. It does have a noise but its more of a white noise than a hissing sound. Its sounds like very faint static which could ONLY be heard if there is no sound, so when you are playing you wont even notice it even if you try. People made such a big deal about the noise that I was worried but its nothing. The features are nice, I like being able to control Chat and Game volumes separately.     The one thing that I really like is being able to hear yourself in your headphones. It really helps me know how loud I should speak when talking to my friends. The other feature that lets you widen the sound or something. Its nice but I enjoyed the game more with that feature turned off. The bass boost is amazing. It really makes the game sounds more enjoyable to listen to.     Overall this is a great product I would recommend to anyone in need of a universal headset. The wires are a bit of a mess but nothing that isn't easily manageable. I really like this headset.
B0039ZF8D2|5.0|Being someone who's not really into hip hop, I did not expect to be blown away by this cd. I bought it because of Damian, (who I think can do no wrong), and hoped for the best. I popped it into my cd player during my lunch break and Distant Relatives impressed me so deeply that I literally stopped eating.<br /><br />If this cd does not get album of the year the music industry is seriously flawed. I haven't heard anything this dynamic in years. Not knowing much about Nas, I thought his  flow was on point although I felt that a couple of his verses were a bit too self indulgent for the album's theme, especially his last verse on Strong Will Continue. Perhaps his fans get it, but I thought that verse took something away from an otherwise outstanding song.<br /><br />I've never heard anything good about Lil Wayne, (probably because I'm not in that age group), but his small contribution on one song sounded decent to me. I found something to love about each and every song, including Joss Stone, whose voice is lovely. These are my standout tracks...<br /><br />As We Enter<br />The beat is so infectious on this one that I can't sit still and the hair-trigger back and forth exchange between Damian and Nas is so darn flawless, it's unbelieveable. It ain't braggin' when it's true.<br /><br />Tribes At War<br />From the African drumming to the thought provoking lyrics, this track is mind blowingly powerful. On the third verse Damian's delivery is absolute fire and K'naan's 5 point breakdown is stunning in both it's lyrical and melodic impact.<br /><br />Strong Will Continue<br />The last verse notwithstanding, this is still one of my favorite tracks. The dramatic sweep of the music, the soaring chorus and the overall uplifting message of encouragement makes this song unforgettable.<br /><br />Dispear<br />Another perfect interaction between the two artists. One of Nas' finest moments on the album, \\"my mind is my modern day spear\\", and completely breathtaking when Damian comes in after the pause. Utterly compelling.<br /><br />Land Of Promise<br />Irresistable, deep bass, classic reggae beat in homage to the motherland and her potential.<br /><br />Patience<br />It's extremely difficult to choose a favorite track, but I think this may be the one I choose. The hauntingly beautiful sample of Amadou and Mariam is seamlessly woven in with lyrics that defy description except as a meditation on humanity. Read the lyrics, then read them again. Damian's styling is beyond outstanding and this song is also where I think Nas really shined his best.<br /><br />Africa Must Wake Up<br />A thoughtful commentary on the motherland, our shared origins as one human family and a call for unity beautifully expressed with the added treat of an engaging guitar solo at the end. It gives the impression that a lot of thought went into the sequencing of this album.<br /><br />Add the fact that the production on the album is stellar and I doubt you will find a more interesting musical adventure for the forseeable future. Proceeds of the sales going to build schools is an added incentive to buy one cd for yourself and another for a friend.Irresistable, deep bass, classic reggae beat in homage to the motherland and her potential.

Alice is a highly intelligent, highly motivated lady, a great scientist admired by all, envied by many in her field.  BUT things begin to go wrong in her life.  She is confused about things, things she never was confused about, always confident and competent.  That was Alice as she was.  But presently it is not how she is now.  This confused person who doesn't know the time or place.  How strange.  From knowing what she wants,she begins to forget who she is, where she is, who the people around her are.      Alice is only 50, too young for occurances to be happening, to forget things.  She has always had a good mind, remembering, teaching, so what could be happening.  She doesn't know.  There so many places to go, things to do.  But no.  This descent into madness, into nothingness, being highly competent, then needed to be treated like an infant must happen.  Why?  But things happen.  Must there be a why or how?  It seems not.  So like a fast train her mind, her intelligence is rushing away never to return.  She is not the person she once was, but she is still Alice far from the person she once was.  Tragic,but this is her fate, her karma.

They were the first band I went to see live ($6.00 back in the day) I love DVD sets with rare concert footage, and the little tidbits into the past. It's kind of like reliving my childhood as well. Normally I wouldn't buy a full on documentary, but if you are a RUSH fan like me this set is a must have. I couldn't stop watching it, twice in 2 days. This one's a keeper. There is something in this set for all fans of RUSH, even if you aren't a rabid fan like me. I highly recommend this set.
B000002L9S|5.0|After hearing \\"Papa Don't Preach\\", \\"Open Your Heart\\", \\"La Isla Bonita\\", and all Madonna's other hits on Celebration, I decided Madonna was my 7th favorite artist. So, several months later, after my mom's friend Priscilla gave me a copy of Ray Of Light, I started buying all Madonna's albums.<br /><br />When this album came to me, I put it away for several days (too busy listening to LaV) but when I finally listened to it, I regretted ever putting it away.<br /><br />This is officially my 5th favorite Madonna studio album. From in love songs (True Blue, Open Your Heart, Jimmy Jimmy, Love Makes The World Go Round) to sad songs (Live To Tell) this is an awesome album.<br /><br />If you want a good introduction to Madonna and don't want to buy a Greatest Hits album, choose Like a Virgin, Like a Prayer, or this. (I think Ray Of Light and Bedtime Stories are her best albums personally, but I'm not sure it would be a great introduction to her overall dance quality.)
B001PU8N0I|4.0|Another excellent BBC production. Although a lesser known story of Dickens it was thoroughly enjoyable. The characters are as varied and colorful as you possibly can imagine and the cast brings them to life. You want to root for the 'good guys' and love to hate the bad ones. The going back and forth between the poor dark alleys of life in those days with the very colorful rich upper-class' life prevents this story from becoming too depressing. If you like period pieces, this is a must see
B000002LGQ|5.0|I got Madonna's fourth album, Like A Prayer, on the 1st of this month. When I first listened to it, I immediately knew it was one of my favorite Madonna albums.<br /><br />\\"Like A Prayer\\" and \\"Express Yourself\\" I had heard beforehand, so I already knew this album would have a great feel, but the rest of the songs on here were awesome bonuses.<br /><br />In \\"Like A Prayer\\", Madonna sings about her true love whose voice \\"takes her there\\".<br /><br />In \\"Express Yourself\\", she tells us second best isn't ever enough, so we should put our loves to the test.<br /><br />\\"Love Song\\" is NOT a love song, according to Madonna. She tells her \\"love\\" to say what they mean, mean what they say.<br /><br />\\"Till D eath Do Us Part\\" is a great follow-up to \\"Love Song\\", where she sings about her divorce and how her love \\"don't love her anymore\\".<br /><br />The sad songs continue with \\"Promise To Try\\" where she sings about her mother's leave from this world. She promises to try to be okay without her... but you know how hard that is.<br /><br />Finally, we reach a non-break up love song - \\"Cherish\\". Madonna \\"perishes the thought of leaving, she never would.\\"<br /><br />Then, she switches back to a sad-yet-lovable song, \\"Oh Father\\", where she finally has gotten away from her abusive people-in-charge.<br /><br />We get our second non-break up love song with \\"Dear Jessie\\". She tells her Jessie about \\"the love parade\\" and \\"pink elephants\\". Such a sweet song. :)<br /><br />I have always wanted a positive song about family, and Madonna answers that want with \\"Keep It Together\\". She sings to us about wanting families to stay together (keep it together).<br /><br />After \\"Spanish Eyes\\", Madonna sings a Lord's Prayer, followed by \\"I reserve... I reserve... I have a reservation... WHAT DO YOU MEAN IT'S NOT IN THE COMPUTER?!\\" in \\"Act Of Contrition\\". A funny way to end the album, but still keeping the overall feel of it.<br /><br />My fourth favorite Madonna album. I highly recommend it. :)
B0000257O9|5.0|The three bonus tracks were the reason to buy this album for a third time (LP - 1983, CD - 1991). Front and back pictures are just like the ones in the LP. Back picture (Geoff) in the first CD was offcentered giving the impression of a cheap and hurried up release.<br /><br />Excellent sound. Bonus tracks are quite interesting: one of them is a different version of one of the original tracks. The other two, although simpler than the original eight, are nice songs to be considered as new (unheard) material. Essay in booklet is an insight to the story of this short lived band. Including lyrics would have made a major overall improvement.<br /><br />Like it or not, The Buggles had to do with Yes and this shouldn't be taken lightly.
B000002NJS|5.0|I can't believe I haven't reviewed this one yet!<br /><br />So, after my mom gave me \\"Celebration\\" for my 15th birthday, her friend Priscilla gave me a burned copy of this.<br /><br />I immediately had to listen to it, and I immediately could see why Madonna fans list this as her best album.<br /><br />She starts us off in \\"Drowned World/Substitute For Love\\" by saying how sad she is she doesn't have a current love and needs to find a \\"substitute for love\\".<br /><br />In \\"Swim\\", Madonna refuses to keep carrying these sins on her backs, so she swims to the ocean shore.<br /><br />\\"Ray Of Light\\"; the ever-famous title track (tied with \\"Like A Prayer\\" for fan favorite) is about her singing about her children.<br /><br />In the next song, she does her sig  re - singing about her true love in a way that makes us not be able to stop listening to it.<br /><br />Following that, in \\"Skin\\", Madonna sings about how she's got somebody, well, under her skin. Take that in any sense you want.<br /><br />\\"Nothing Really Matters\\"; the title pretty much sums it up. Nothing really matters, love is all we need...<br /><br />I haven't really listened to \\"Sky Fits Heaven\\" or \\"Shanti/Ashtangi\\" as often as I should, but they're still good songs.<br /><br />\\"Frozen\\"; her second biggest hit off this album, is about Madonna liking a person who \\"only sees what their eyes want to see\\" but \\"if she could melt their heart, they'd never be apart\\".<br /><br />\\"The Power Of Good-Bye\\" is another song that is pretty much summed up by the title. Nothing's a greater power than the power of good-bye.<br /><br />In \\"To Have And Not To Hold\\", Madonna has been told her new love is to have but not to hold. Poor Madonna. :/<br /><br />In \\"Little Star\\", she tells us never to forget where we came from; love. :)<br /><br />In the very last track, she sings about running away to get rid of all her fears, all her tears, and to look for herself. Something we all do at some point.<br /><br />Her best 90's album, as well as her best album overall in my opinion. If you don't want to buy one of her Greatest Hits albums, buy this instead. :). :)
034544678X|2.0|I bought this book based on the rave reviews, expecting it to be revolutionary in the way we think about dogs. I am quite disappointed. It is a primarily collection of personal stories and does not really have new ideas about interacting with canines. My grievances:<br /><br />* I already knew most of the information from reading the book \\"Good Owners, Great Dogs\\" (which is 10 years older) and by watching Victoria Stillwell's \\"It's Me or the Dog\\" TV show.<br /><br />* I learned far too much about the author's life. I don't need to know that her nieces use the term \\"happy slappy\\" to describe a pat to a dog's head, and I didn't need to spend 4 pages reading about how one of her dogs ran away while she was having her roof re-done. Moreover, I suspect the author exaggerated some of the stories. For example, she deals with an aggressive dog that had, \\"a head the size of an oven\\" (page 1), which is unbelievable.<br /><br />* The book is far too wordy. It could easily be half the length it is. The following quote demonstrates how the author has little to say but expresses it verbosely:<br /><br />\\"Given that rank is important to both humans and dogs, how does that affect our interactions with each other? It's not completely clear...  One night over cocktails, John Wright, another certified Applied Animal Behavioralist, and I thoroughly enjoyed debating each other over whether dogs envision humans as being part of their social hierarchy. He said no, I said yes, and by the second gin and tonic, we both thought that it mattered little who was right but that it was a great question. (page 155).\\"<br /><br />* Some of the author's cutesy writing is confusing. For example, she refers to human hands as paws. You may need to re-read a passage to figure out who she's referring to: the dog or the owner.<br /><br />* She constantly references her Ph.D. and the fact that she's an Applied Animal Behavioralist.<br /><br />Unless you really want to learn about the author, skip this book.

Who would've thought that in just 27 years, the woman singing about her Lucky Star would grow into the one tons of people know now as the Queen Of Pop?<br /><br />This album is full of dance music about love and just being with each other. If you want an awesome dance album, buy this. All pop lovers should own this.<br /><br />In the very first song, \\"Lucky Star\\", she sings over and over again about her lucky star, the person she likes. :)<br /><br />In the next song, \\"Borderline\\", her lucky star is pushing her love over the borderline.<br /><br />In \\"Burning Up\\", Madonna is well, burning up, for her lucky star's love.<br /><br />We switch from in a relationship to break-up in \\"I Know It\\". Madonna knows her date's gonna take his love and run.<br /><br />\\"Holiday\\" is about just taking a holiday to celebrate anything and everything we have.<br /><br />Madonna decides it's time to switch back to romance with \\"Think Of Me\\" where she tells her date they better think of her or else they're over.<br /><br />\\"Physical Attraction\\" is about, well, Madonna having a physical attraction for somebody.<br /><br />Last but certainly not least, \\"Everybody\\" is a great dance song where Madonna tells all of us to get up and dance, and once the song starts, you know you want to listen to her. ;)
030726999X|3.0|It wasn't the worst book, but it also was not the best. There was not much action in the book as there was in the first two books. Also, the author seemed to fill in pages with a lot of Sweden's history which made it a pretty boring read. I read it because I had already read the first two books and I had to finish the series. Overall, it was an okay book to read.
0767817664|5.0|Saw it when it came out (feels like 1955 now) at the movie theater, and it was a riot. I don't know how it plays on DVD at home, but I have so many fun memories. You probably already know the premise of the boy who has trouble convincing his friends and everyone else that the guy who just moved in next door is a vampire on a killing rampage. The boy is a fan of a late night tv show, Fright Night, whose host is played my McDowall. The casting of McDowall is one of those things that could have exploded in the face of the producers, but as it turns out it worked brilliantly. McDowall made a career camping it up in B-grade horror movies, and here he plays someone who made a career camping it up in D-grade (pun intended) movies. This type of self-parody is carried to an extreme, because the movie spends most of its first half making fun of the established cliches of the genre, only to use them all, ALL, in the second half, with a straight face, and to great effect. It is not nearly as gory as the reality-horror we see these days, and I know that to some this will detract from the film, but not for me. Also, this may have been the first movie where the vampire transformation changed the whole facial demeanor of the monster, at least to my knowledge, so there's a little innovation in the genre's rules right there. And then there's Geoffreys' performance (the scene with the mop on his head, then reading the note, is the type of disturbing scary that stays with you, rather than boo-hoo scary), and Sarandon's, suave and threatening, Bearse's seduced virgin, and Ragsdale's earnest geek. Zap the popcorn, unplug the telephone, turn off the light, and enjoy!
1435248244|5.0|My first thought was...this is familiar.  Yes, the Twilight Zone show of the Pretty people and the daughter who didn't want to look like \\"them\\". If you haven't seen this show you will enjoy the relation to the \\"Uglies\\". This book is in the teen section at our library. There are many teens I know who do not know that the Twilight Zone is like a forerunner for many good stories. I am glad Mr. Scott enlarged the TZ story to make one all his own.....a very good one too.  I look forward to the rest of the series (even though I'm not a teen anymore).  D.
B0038QMREA|5.0|I'd previously heard Kristian Matsson's first release, Shallow Graves, which was good, but his sophmore effort is simply superb.  Love is All, Burden of Tomorrow, A Lion's Heart are personal favorites, but I truly love every track on this album.  Fantastic!  Get it, it's worth every penny.
B002VECLVY|5.0|A Single Man was a fabulous movie. Well acted by Colin Firth and although Julianne Moore was only in one scene she was wonderful as his best friend. There was so much chemistry between the two, it was hard to take your eyes off them. I can understand Colin being nominated for an oscar it was an oscar winning performance.
0307474712|3.0|I won't add much to the other spot on reviews but to reiterate:  beautiful, haunting, stunningly and realistically written novel.  A classic. Will go down in the annals of literature and be read 300 years from now by the yuppies of tomorrow in their moon-colonies, as a perfect sociological study of the perplexing and wasteful behavior of twenty and thirtysomethings in the late 20th century.  This book is definitely a literary coup and all that.  It is NOT, though, contrary to the reviews and cover marketing and splashy glossy weekly blurbs about being the funniest rom-com EVER - it is NOT I repeat NOT, a romantic comedy by any means, it is NOT a more serious Bridget Jones, it is NOT a cousin to Sense and Sensibility, or anything remotely related to Jane Austen, (the marketing people's dream chick-selling-point-du-decade it would seem) and it is not chick-lit.  It's a somber book, with a spritz, a soupcon, of genuinely funny humor every so often, inserted at random to keep the story from steering into Nicholas Sparks Waters. I loved the book for what it was, incidentally, but not for the reason I purchased it, which was because I was in the mood for a bit of light British lit, and that's what the cover, with its neoney orange, pink, cartooney invitation for fun, and People Magazine - told me it was going to be.  I loved it, but perhaps would have, instead of purchasing it, intead made this a library choice, had I but known what I was in for.  Now that I own it, I will re-read it, and recommend it to others who want a SOMBER read, but again just not what I expected.  Feel slightly duped. GREAT book, well-written/crafted.  NOT a comedy though. 1 star removed for misleading marketing, one star off for jolting, cheatey ending.
0307474712|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading this story.  There are characters you care about wrapped in a compeling story. I highly recommend this book for anyone looking to be transported and entertained for a few hours. You wont be disappointed.
B003IPC5UC|2.0|Don't get me wrong, the focus of the article is still kylies' beauty ...,and talent of course.  I paid for a booklet in which the photos are off center and duplicated.   Leaving much to be desired.  Next, the bonus disc is crap you can see on youtube, which will most likely be released on a dvd sometime soon.  Finally, you don't get the actual video to \\"All the lovers\\" just the behind the scene.  Note: if you live in the U.S.A, when you purchase the Cd bundle that includes the video beware, most of Kylie's singles with videos do not work in the U.S.A....., speaking from experience. ( I feel the artist is not to blame of course, but should be made aware for integrity purposes).... do not worry Kylie, I am relaxed!
1423113497|5.0|My son who is eight read all the Fable Haven and didn't really want any other series, However he has loved this one.  He finished all three books in a month.  (Reading at night mostly).
0307474712|4.0|As several reviewers mentioned, I too was inundated with the numerous positive reviews in EW and other publications.  I picked up the book because I'm always a sucker for interesting plot devices.  I wasn't exactly sure if this would be \\"chick-lit\\" with a twist or something more.  I definitely think that it's more....but not sure that it's quite 5 stars.    On the positive side, I really liked \\"one day a year\\" format.  The author does a great job of leaving some mystery and then filling in the details in various ways so that it doesn't feel too choppy.  I also think he did a great job of capturing what is it like to be at those periods in your life --- idealistic early 20's, to settled acceptance in late 30's.  As someone who met my husband when I was 30, was friends with him for 8 years and then 3 years later, got married --- I could definitely see that this evolution of a real relationship -- humor, warts and all.  I did not feel that Emma was spending her years \\"pining\\" for Dex --- but I also feel like she didn't want to settle for something that wasn't right for her.  Also, it was clear from the beginning that Dex had major feelings for Em, so think that there was always a mutual attraction.  For me, what really rings true is that they could make each other laugh --- I think that is the single most important thing.    I stayed up last night to finish the book and agree with the reviewer that said by the middle of the book, I just couldn't put it down.  In the end, I'm not sure if I really liked the ending as I think it was a bit \\"made for movie\\" ending.  I agree with the other posters that in the beginning, both of the characters had traits which made them unsympathetic --- yet over the 20 years, you do see them evolve.  Dex's problems with alcohol and drugs were particularly hard to stomach at times.  In the end, Emma did not change the world like she wanted, but I think that she did change Dex.  I would definitely rank this high on my list of what I've read in2010.
B002VECM6S|4.0|I'm sure hollywood fugged the story a bunch, but it was still a good family movie.  Acting was poor in some parts, but what else is now.  Sandra Bullock did a good job, but I don't think it's her best work.  All and all a really good family night movie to watch.

0316010669|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  Gladwell does a great job of using real world examples to draw you in and then backing it up with research / science.  The subject matter in another's hands could be deadly dull, but he's a very good writer and the topic is captivating - how we think, the value of snap judgments, and the amazing capacity of our brains to put stuff together.  There aren't any final gotcha conclusions but he  puts out a lot of interesting ideas and I feel like it might change my behavior in some ways.  For instance, how can we use the active subconscious / quick judgments and not feel like everything needs to rely on data and spelled out logic?    I definitely found myself wanting to share the ideas in this book with others.  Highly recommended.
B003J27WFW|5.0|This is a must have for any Rush fan.  Shows their early years and the growth and history of one of the greatest bands of all time.  Now, it's time to get them into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame!
B002NXSRX4|3.0|I think the overall reviews of G.I.Joe are just about fair. As an action movie it's about what you'd expect. It's not great, but it's entertaining and there are lots of special effects, gunfights, and explosions. Where the movie falls short is in depicting the classic characters or in capturing the feel of the old tv show or comic book series. I think the last part was something that was important in making this a successful series of movies, and they messed it up. The gross was great on the first movie because long time fans were giving it a try. I don't think many of them will be returning to the theater for a sequel. Scarlett-Ripcord??? Why? Why not Scarlett-Snake Eyes like in the comics, or Scarlett-Duke like in the cartoon? Going with Ripcord makes no sense. How is it better? There are a lot of things like that that take away from the movie. But ignoring all the history, it's a 3-star action movie.
B003J27WFW|5.0|Watched both dvd's all the way through as soon as I got them and in one word \\"AMAZING\\"<br /><br />Rush is a GREAT band and some of the BEST musicians in the world! I've been a fan since grade school (late 70's) and it was really interesting to watch how these guys got together from the very beginning. I never knew that Geddy and Alex were childhood friends and met in grade school. This doc takes you from the very beginning, thru all the ups and downs, all the musical changes such as implementing more keyboards in the late 80's, to the present day success they are still having after all theses years. Just went and saw them live in Chicago for the first time and going again Aug 23rd 2010! Can't wait!<br /><br />Like I said this doc is \\"AMAZING\\" .. If your a Rush fan especially but still very interesting if your not. Viva Rush!!
0812550757|5.0|With any type of artist, be it an author, musician, director, etc. I always get tired of the fact that they only have one style. It might be a good style, but when all their subsequent works seem like the original that gets tedious. This book was so refreshing because it was so drastically different than Ender's Game, yet it was still a fantastic book in it's own right. Some reviews say it's slower, in the sense there is less action. That's true, but I found myself glued to this book, I could not put it down. This is the way science-fiction is supposed to be done, with heart and soul and using technology to probe the human condition.<br /><br />I will say that Card's style of writing is still the same. But I happen to like that style, emphasizing the telling of the story over flowery language around the story.
0783225857|4.0|I watch this movie periodically and still enjoy it.  My only disappointment with this DVD is that on an older VHS cassette I had, there were interviews with the actors who played Scout and Jem at the end of the the movie. This DVD does not have this in the \\"extras\\".
B0013TXA5Y|3.0|I'm 30 something and enjoy reading young adult fiction now and then. This may grab the younger crowd and make them go wild but it didn't do much for me. I found the writing boring at times to the point where I'd skip her descriptions and jump to dialogue. I also found that the writer seemed to have a list of adjectives and descriptive phrases that she used over and over again. I like the story, the plot and the potential of the characters but the writing brought the book down. I also found that it was incredibly predictable. There were times were Clary put two and two together and I thought, \\"Hmmm, I thought she already knew that.\\" I read all three books so I guess it was good enough to make me read all three. My criticisms are for all three books. I'd say they got better each time but even the last was not so great.
B002ZCDR88|5.0|I had the good fortune to have heard Natalie perform a number of these songs live, in Washington, DC. The songs were crafted from poems that she had found in her extensive research for this project. Her voice is rich and pure, folksy in a good way and reminescent of Celtic styles at times. I love this album and deeply appreciate the work that went into its creation. Natalie Merchant has a fan for life.
B002QNGKGW|5.0|My 5 star review is based SOLELY on the previous seasons of Dexter. I love the show. I am addicted. I have been tearing through the previous 3 seasons. Tonight, when i felt the need to get my Dexter \\"fix\\" and start season 4, I came here and was concerned with all the negative reviews regarding the edited nature of the show. I nervously purchased the season. It is NOT edited. Not to spoil things, but nudity happens fairly early in episode 1. It is safe kids (well maybe not safe FOR the kids). The purchased version is NOT edited. The \\"free sample\\" is probably the one that people are complaining about. Long live the Bay Harbor Butcher!
0345457692|5.0|This book can be a bit raw and is not to everyone's taste, but i loved it. It's some of my favorite rough poetry and still the only book I've read that explores the intersection of body with mind and how each affects the other in terms of how we see ourselves. I can't really do Altered Carbon the justice it deserves in this review but recommend checking it out.
B0021L8V0M|4.0|As the movie \\"Salt\\" opens, CIA agent Evelyn Salt (Angela Jolie) is being tortured in a North Korean prison.  Fortunately, her CIA boss (played with marvellous deadpan charm by Liev Schrieber) manages to make a trade to get her home safely to her German boyfriend.<br /><br />The storyline jumps ahead two years.  Salt is married to her boyfriend and working at an unadvertised CIA location.  A walk-in Russian defector named Orlov claims that a group of former Soviet deep cover agents, the KA program, has been activated to kill the Russian President when he arrives in New York City.  under interrogation by the skeptical Salt, Orlov turns everything upside down by naming her as a KA agent.  Salt panics and goes on the run, dodging the pursuing CIA with daring improvisions and scary quick martial arts skills.  Salt will go first to her husband, then to the defector Orlov, before pressing on to New York City and the assassination plot.  Neither Salt nor her opponents nor even the assassination plot are who they seem to be.<br /><br />The non-stop action and Evelyn Salt's Jason Bourne-like sense of cool will help the audience get past some significat plot holes to a Mission: Impossible-type ending.  Recommended as an exciting spy thriller.
0307454541|5.0|Great story!  If you feel bored at the beginning (I didn't, but a friend of mine that I recommended the book to apparently did...), stick with it!  You'll be happy you did.  I'm just sad I'm done reading all three books in the trilogy.  Definitely fast-paced, thoroughly entertaining reading that will leave you wanting more!
B003L20ICE|5.0|By choice, I hadn't been to the movies for quite awhile, and so was pleasantly surprised and greatly pleased by this humorous family drama distinguished by great acting and believable peformances by a stellar cast.      In many ways, this film was a send-up of the over-intellectualizing California life style; in others, an entertaining non-preachy commentary on the ongoing sexual revolution and changes in American mores.  Yes, there were  times when the movie was draggy and self-conscious.  But overall, it was a better than expected viewing experience.  Highly recommended.
B000JJSJR8|1.0|I've tried to play this movie on 3 different dvd players including the brand new one and my pc. It feels like they forgot to burn the movie on the disc and it's completely blank. I don't recommend it to anyone
B002ZG995E|5.0|This was one of the highlights of the Summer movies, growing up watching this show who didn't love it!?<br /><br />So the 2010 movie, a great cast from Liam Neeson as Hannibal Smith, Bradley Cooper as Faceman, Quinton Rampage Jackson as BA Baracus, Sharlto Copley as Howling Mad Murdoch.<br /><br />The movie starts off with one of the longest prologue's/ Intro's I've seen in a while had me grinning from ear to ear while watching it, we see how the Team is put together in Mexico, some nice action scenes in the beginning then que the iconic theme music which gave me goosebumps and I felt like a kid again watching the TV show... and fast forward like 8 years later, the team has become a well oiled, seasoned, crack commando unit, they are in Iraq where the A Team is together doing one last job given to them by CIA Man John Lynch (Patrick Wilson) to retrieve some counterfeit U.S Treasury plates that some Iraqi Insurgents have and are moving in a heavily armored convoy...we get a pretty cool action sequence as the Team retrieves the plates then are set up and accused of stealing plates and are then sentenced separately, each going to a different Maximum Security Prison. We follow the A Team as they promptly escape, so the Team goes out to clear their name and find out who really took the Plates and set them up as the fall guys, throw in Jessica Beal as Face's former old flame who is after them and CIA guy Lynch, some wild action sequences, comedy, nostalgia (light on the nostalgia which was good, there were a few good odes to the TV show but for the most part filmmakers and actors kept the spirit TV show in the movie) Ok so some action scenes were they plausible? Probably not, But watching Faceman firing a .50 Cal machine gun mounted on a Tank free falling some 20,000 feet at a Drone Predator is pretty damn kick ass! This is the A Team!! Which makes it fun!<br /><br />The whole cast was great, of course growing up my favorite was Murdoch, I think it's a given everyone loved Murdoch and Sharlto Copely (District 9) did a wonderful job as the crazy man and Rampage Jackson as BA, good job for a guy who never acted, I am sure he picked Liam's Brain for some tips, Cooper with those damn good looks any guy would want as Faceman had the perfect charm, ladies man, and can kick ass, then Liam as the stoic, the brains, leader Hannibal who doesn't like Liam, all around great acting from this group I left the theater thoroughly happy with a smile on my face, will pick this up when it is released.pely (District 9) did a wonderful job as the crazy man and Rampage Jackson as BA, good job for a guy who never acted, I am sure he picked Liam's Brain for some tips, Cooper with those damn good looks any guy would want as Faceman had the perfect charm, ladies man, and can kick ass, then Liam as the stoic, the brains, leader Hannibal who doesn't like Liam, all around great acting from this group I left the theater thoroughly happy with a smile on my face, will pick this up when it is released.
B002GHHHP6|5.0|A worthy little film on the far west the way we can see it today, a big farce. Everything is false. A woman is playing poker and picking pockets. A Marshall is robbing the bank of a poker competition, with the agreement of the organizer. All kinds of players who are cheating and trying to win with weapons or violence, or even unfair padlocks. Indians who are organizing wagon train attacks for some dollars and the killing of some fake Indians still for a lot of money from a Russian ambassador. In one word everything is false, a big lie and a big laugh between or among the gun fire and the bullets. And yet all those crooks are trying to steal one another and the only woman in the tale will get the last word, except that she will only get a small part of the stake. Never put all your eggs in one basket. The only real interest of this film is not to show you what the far west used to be but to make you enjoy a comedy about it and that comedy is of course absurd. And that's why it is funny with some good actors who can play surprise and fear and joy and pleasure (you see the one I mean) and horror just as if the rattle snake under their feet were a real rattle snake. It sounds like one all right but it is nothing but a fake plastic rattling device and it won't bite. Even though they had a rattle snake tamer on the team, or rather because. I guess he is the one who dubbed them for the rattling to sound really real. Speaking of Canada Dry. Well we are in the country of the saints, Saint Louis and so many others down to New Orleans.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Cr&eacute;teil, CEGID

I mean, what would the 80's have been without \\"Legs\\" and \\"Sharp Dressed Man\\"? Even ZZ Top's terrible foray into disco, \\"Viva Las Vegas\\" is included on this album.<br /><br />There really is very little else to say about ZZ Top's Greatest Hits, the ultimate boogie rock album of all times.

You may not find it to be the greatest Batman story of all time, but you'll be hard-pressed not to laugh at the end. Re-printed more times than almost any other comic in history, The Killing Joke is still readily available, meaning you have no excuse. If you've read it before, go back and read it again. You owe it to yourself.
B002ZG997C|5.0|The cast in this movie is fantastic. The movie is fantastic. Denzel Washington makes for the perfect starring role & Gary Oldman is the perfect nemesis. Mila Kunis? Excellent, as well.<br />The cinematography runs largely in sepia tones, though the movie is color. It goes perfectly with the post nuclear war world.<br />Nuclear war aftermath movies have been done many times. Trust me, not like this one.<br />Mr. Washington has been walking west for the past 30 years. He has a definitive purpose. That purpose & the surrounding elements are revealed in the end. You feel you know the ending; it's predictable. Nope, there is a very good twist or two which will surprise you.<br />This movie falls into the \\"Do Not Miss\\" category. It's excellent
B000002GY9|5.0|Tom Waits is a musical shape-shifter.  But his first several albums were a fairly consistent mix of blues, lounge jazz and folk.  In my opinion this is the best of the early albums.
B003M30T9Y|5.0|If you have, at any point in your life, liked pop music, get this album. The tracks play like a history of pop music set on shuffle, and the overarching sci-fi theme is icing on the already mind-blowing cake. Loved it.
B000051VWW|5.0|I love this album. I overlooked this record back in 2000. This is a record that is less about the 8 years that have gone by than promise and vitality of the here and now. It is a record that is by turns moving, elegiac and beautiful. The music stripped back to its essential elements: voice, melody, and meticulously arranged instrumentation. The result is a record of bare, sometimes startingly, immediacy. This album has been certified 3x Platinum. Remember, this was 2000.
0451209338|5.0|I'm not really a fan of the spy genre, regardless of medium (the rebooted Bond series is OK in my book, and I've read a little bit of le Carre, but that's about as deep as my well of experience runs), but The Kill Artist knocked me on my ass with a mixture of surprising, subtle complexity, believable ethical ambiguity in some of its characters, and a surprising lack of political bias.  My one complaint might be that this novel is almost unbiased to a fault (almost was the operative word there, I had to go looking for an issue with this book to find one) and may leave people with little knowledge of the historical background involved with the impression that one side of the conflict it explores has more of a point than reality might otherwise suggest-it sort of goes without saying that opinions about that will differ, and thankfully the book's relative objectivity will ensure that political bias on the reader's part only needs to be an issue if the reader is desperate to make it one.

B001RTP3YQ|5.0|The quality of the amazing musicians, like Javier Mas, Sharon Robinson and the backup singers, and the marvelous arrangements make this a truly great album.  Leonard Cohen is graceful and deep voiced and totally present, not exceeding the limits of his voice but using it as a lyrical tool, perfectly integrated with his terrific ensemble.  As others have written, this music is not just a sentimental experience or rehearing of tunes you liked in the past, but a truly satisfying musical experience in the now.  Thanks, Leonard Cohen.
B0030E1XJU|5.0|My son received this for his 6th birthday and he did struggle at first with putting the characters in place but caught on within a week.  He loves to show people how he can set it up and describes what is going to happen before he hits the plunger and sets off the Rube Goldberg effect.  We can't wait to get more sets and string them together.  And I like buying the buddy packs, keeping them on hand, and surprising him with a reward for good behavior.
9056912445|5.0|Some endgame books assume too much prior knowledge and lack important detail, while others are excessively comprehensive and can become both overwhelming and boring.  This book manages to strike the right balance, focussing on a number of key positions judged by the author as important for both practical and theoretical reasons.  It is generally well written and the ideas are presented in a clear and concise manner.  The focus of the book is to teach you the principles of good endgame play, not merely to memorize a series of positions.  It is this emphasis on understanding that puts this book well ahead of other endgame tomes.    Not only have the positions been well selected, but they are logically structured so that the reader can build a deep comprehension by studying problems that increase in difficulty.  Also of great value are the two tests that are included.  The first is a basic test at the start of the book that gives a clear indication of current endgame strength - I'm sure many will be surprised by the results. The book also concludes with another test to see if you have really absorbed the ideas and principles.  The use of these tests, along with the overall arrangement and presentation of the material, makes it clear that the author has thought about the process of training and cares about the reader being able to develop practical skills and apply theory to real world problems.    My only criticism is that the book has been translated and there are occasionally a few convoluted sentences and odd phrasing.  Generally it is a very good translation, but now and again some of the writing is a bit unclear and requires extra work to make sense of.  This, however, is a minor gripe, as the majority of the book is extremely good, and where the language occasionally falls down, the compelling logic and care taken with the selection of endgames compensates for any other shortcomings.      I believe players of all strengths would benefit from this book.  This is without a doubt one of the best endgame books ever written.
B002ZG9788|3.0|The special effects was great, the story line suck.  It didn't sticked to Greek mythology like the original Clash of the Titans.

0307454541|5.0|When I started this book I had my doubts.  The first few pages, I thought, were confusing and boring, but once I got going I could not put this book down.  It's a great story that will surprise the reader!  It's like three different stories in one book.  I usually do not like reading mystery books, but Steig Larrson had me hooked!  I can hardly wait to start The Girl Who Played with Fire!
B0030BCCAM|5.0|BEST SONY RELEASE EVER!<br />A MUST FOR ALL FANS OF THE ZOMBIES!<br /><br />The wait is over! This 3 CD box set neatly packages Colin Blunstone's top 3 albums from the 1970s, with One Year, Ennismore and Journey. With excellent artwork, each disc comes packaged in a mini-LP jacket replica of each album, similar to that of the original vinyl LPs. The sound quality is amazing, as should be expected from Sony.

Though both projects produced very different forms of music, Argent backed Blunstone on his solo albums. Argent's hits included the singles Hold Your Head Up, Liar covered by Three Dog Night and God Gave Rock and Roll to You, which was later covered by Kiss. I met Gene Simmons of Kiss some years back and he stated that he is a fan of The Zombies and Argent.<br /><br />Personally, I found Colin Blunstone's solo albums to be very likable, if not near-perfect. It was hard for me to digest the over-the-top, art rock sound of Argent with Russ Ballard's vocals. While a solo Colin Blunstone maintained the quality sound that was present with The Zombies, Argent strayed away from the look and sound of The Zombies to make music that was more commercially viable during the 70s. The original Argent lineup reunited at the High Voltage Festival in Victoria Park London on July 25, 2010 and there are plans for a reunion tour.<br /><br />In the end, Colin Blunstone's solo career lasted longer than that of Argent. Blunstone charted hits during the 80s while working with Dave Stewart. Such hits included his masterful version of What Becomes Of The Broken Hearted, which songwriter Jimmy Ruffin stated was his favorite of all renditions. Blunstone was also a member of the groups Keats and The Alan Parsons Project where he sang lead vocals on the song Old And Wise. In both groups Blunstone worked with Scottish rock legend David Paton from Pilot, who is known for their song Magic.<br /><br />Colin Blunstone has also been touring with his own band, playing concerts which allow to him focus on the quality solo material from these albums.<br /><br />Although Colin Blunstone is currently performing solo concerts with his own band, he and Rod Argent are also working on an album of new material with The Zombies. The current lineup of The Zombies includes Colin Blunstone, Rod Argent, bassist Jim Rodford and drummer Steve Rodford.

0143038419|5.0|I was hesitant to buy this book as I didn't think that, as an average income, working mother of two, I would learn something about finding myself in it.  We all face challenges but how many of us could really afford to take a year off from work AND travel the world? However, I knew the movie was coming out and the trailer looks cute, so I wanted to read the book before seeing the movie.  I am glad I did.  The writer does not come across as over-privileged or preachy.  She truly and simply takes you along with her on her journey to find life's joy and let's you figure out how her lessons might be incorporated into your own life.  I ended up being grateful that she was privileged enough to take the journey and talented enough to share it in such an inspirational way...and now I can't wait for the movie to come out!!! It's an easy read, broken down into many small chapters.  I highly recommend it.
0345494997|5.0|Those of you that have read my reviews before know that I do not rate books unless they are five star statures. LOVING FRANK IS A MASTERPIECE OF LITERATURE. From my point of view, I truly feel, this work, by Nancy Horan, is worthy of a Pulitzer Prize.<br /><br />It is very possible that some of the readers of this book might think it to be a dynamic women's read only...simply not true. Because of our basic human nature, much of the main female character would never quite be appreciated by her family, friends, and readers of yellow journalism for her kindness and loving affection. For many of us this this kind of love will never happen.<br /><br />This is a story of a brave woman that followed her dream, often with fears, bereavement for leaving her children for a time, and leaving her first husband for the affection of Wright. It was a story of how we judge others so unfairly before judging ourselves. After all we are only human and prone to mistakes. Yet, I truly feel that what this brave and understanding kind soul did was not a mistake.<br /><br />The ending was emotionally devistating to me. This is the kind of book no one...and I mean no one should read the ending before its time. The climax of the book was one of the most powerful I have ever experienced. You will love...LOVING FRANK. I did.<br /><br />Thanks for reading my review. I hope this review helps you decide whether or not you want to purchase \\"LOVING FRANK\\".  If you do you will experience this roller coaster feeling for yourself.<br /><br />Steve
B003JJA59K|1.0|Cant say anything about the movie really, what I got to see was pretty good. I have satellite internet and I was not impressed in the manner in which amazon downloads the movies, small bits at a time. their signal kept getting lost, even though my satellite was fine, not sure what the problem was, but I really dont care to watch a movie in 15 minute intervals-download the whole freaking movie geeeez-doubt I ever use amazon video again, was terrible.
B002MW50KO|1.0|If there was ever a recording that proves some singers should stick to their genre, this is it. Dylan's vocals are dreadful; his &#34;singing&#34; is so bad it makes my ears want to hide inside my head... This is like some kind of bad joke.
B0000009SG|4.0|Was this an attempt by Frank to be more commerical while at the same time keeping his edge?  Does it matter?  Frank Zappa was an incredible musician who created his own genre , style and image that is difficult to define.  at a time when seemingly everyone was trying to be original, trying to \\"be themsleves\\". Frank was really doing just that.    This is great album.

B003KUSUG8|5.0|This in my opinion is Eminems best album.  There is not a bad song on this album. From the honest lyrics in \\"changes\\"(he talks about his problems and overcoming them) to the melodic \\"not afraid\\", to the catchy \\"white trash party\\", to the heartfelt proof tribute \\"you're never over\\", to the laid back acoustic \\"space bound\\" and to the fantastic rhyming skills he shows in songs like \\"cinderella man\\", \\"wont back down\\", \\"fire\\", \\"almost famous\\", \\"so bad\\", and \\"no love\\"(lil wayne spits a good verse on this song), Eminem shows why he is one of the greatest rappers and musicians ever.  If you are a fan of rap music you will love this album.  If you are not a fan of rap music you will still enjoy this album.  There is something on it for everyone.  I love all of eminems albums but this one is my favorite.  Eminem is back to his best.  If you are looking for an album to buy that you can listen to over and over again make sure you buy this one, you will not regret it.

Back to Basics is one of my all-time favorite albums and the show exceeded my expectations!

B001F0WXY0|2.0|After seeing typo complaints about the Kindle edition, I decided to look at the free initial chapters before plunking down that much $$. It didn't take me long: '...he was bom on Caladan...\\" in the 5th sentence of Book One! Come on Penguin (and Amazon), either significantly reduce the price or get it right (and do the 40th Anniversary proud). Why not give the first reporter of each typo $1 credit and then fix them. I was hoping to reread the entire Dune saga (this time on the Kindle 3 when it becomes available). Now I think I'll just dig out my original hard-covers instead. Very disappointed!

0143034901|5.0|Every once in a while you finish a novel and come away from it with a sadness similar to that you feel when you are moving across the country and have just said good-bye to your best friends. This was how I felt when I finished this book. The story is basically a mystery. Ten year old Daniel, the son of bookstore owner in post-civil war Barcelona comes across a relatively obscure book titled, \\"The Shadow of the Wind\\" written by the mysterious Julian Carax, an ex-patriot from Barcelona, thought to be living in Paris. Daniel is so taken with the book that he goes in search of other books by the author only to find out that someone has been burning all of the known copies of the 5 novels written by Julian. Daniel sets out on a ten year quest to find out more about Julian and solve the mystery of why someone would want to destroy his whole body of work.<br /><br />But to say that this is just a mystery is an understatment. Woven into the fabric of the mystery is a story about adolescent growth into adulthood,friendships,first crush, broken hearts, first loves, disappointment, revenge and redemtion. Daniel eventually unravels the mystery with the help of his friends and mentors, such as his father, and a host of characters living in his Barcelona neighborhood.<br /><br />While this book was on the European bestseller lists for years, I first heard about it in June 2010 when I was with a tour group in Barcelona. Our group leader recommended this book. I read it after we got home and recognized all of the streets and plazas that Daniel and co-conspiritors visit during the course of his growth into manhoood and his invstigation of the msytery. I found it amazing that the book is all about Barcelona from between 1915 to 1955 but the streets were totally recogonizable to this 21st century first time visitor to Barcelona. I suspect that had I read this book before my visit to Bareclona it would have signifcantly added to my enjoyment of this lovely city.<br /><br />The recent popularity of the Steig Larson books by American readers shows that we Americans are more then willing to embrace novels by non English speaking European authors writing about the home countries. It is time for this masterpiece by Carlos Ruiz Zafon to come out of the \\"Shadows\\" and be embraced in this country in a similar fashion.Larson books by American readers shows that we Americans are more then willing to embrace novels by non English speaking European authors writing about the home countries.

B0000844M8|5.0|As the story opens, George Adamson (Bill Travers), a game warden in Kenya, is bringing three orphan lion cubs home to be cared for by his wife, Joy (Virginia McKenna).  Raised as pets, two of them are eventually sent away to zoos, but the third, Elsa, was especially loved and they decided to keep her.  Of course, that soon became impossible, so they set about rehabilitating her back into the wild knowing she might not survive, but feeling she must have the chance to live free.<br /><br />In the 1950s, no one had ever reintroduced an animal to the wild, and the Adamses were the first animal lovers to do so.  Travers and McKenna are wonderful as the couple and went on to become animal activists after the filming of the movie.  Geoffrey Keene (the 'Minister of Defence' in six James Bond movies) gives able support as George's boss.  The Kenyan landscape photography is simply breathtaking and the lions, at various stages of development, are adorable.<br /><br />John Barry won Academy Awards for both his score and song, which are truly iconic and guaranteed to have you reaching for the tissues.  This beautiful, inspiring, and unforgettable movie is a must-see for animal lovers.
0316017922|4.0|It's amazing how some people can see through some trivial occurrences into the bottom of it. I wish I could learn from it and be able to see behind the surface of people and events. I recommend this book to the \\"why\\" and \\"how it works\\" question lovers. The style of the book is pretty nice too - it's witty and intelligent.
B003ITZBVS|5.0|I hope DC/Warner keeps up the story and production team creating the stories like this. Was amazed at how well done the story was. Animation was also nicely done along with the story and soundtrack to the movie. This movie follows the batman animated series. Hope this may be a start to bring back the batman animated series.  Keep it up DC/Warner this new direction does work. The next release Superman/Batman: Apocalypse also looks good. They have a good behind the scenes feature on the single and 2 disc edition.
0767817486|5.0|I purchased this for my mother and father, they had seen it several years ago, and wanted to watch it again, because a documentary was being aired about the young man in the movie.  They were thrilled to be able to view the movie anytime they want and the price was reasonable.
1932907009|5.0|I've read stacks of magazines and books around the topic of writing for the screen. None have made as much sense, and inspired me as much as Blake Snyder's \\"Save The Cat\\". After reading this book, I pulled screenplays off the shelf that I thought would never see the light of day again. Now I feel with Blake's suggestions and ideas that if my screenplays have any chance of selling it will be after I run them through the screen of tools found in \\"Save The Cat\\". You can only gain from reading \\"Save The Cat\\".

B003JLA4KS|5.0|Rush: Beyond the Lighted Stage is the best rocumentary that I have ever seen.  Excellent mix of information, music, and humor.  It takes you through all the stages of Rush's career.  From the early days with John Rutsey all the way through a hunting lodge dinner with Geddy, Alex and Neil.

B002ZG97RE|3.0|This movie takes place in the general time frame of April-May, 2003.  This is the period just after the initial invasion as US officials began to start the work of stabilizing and rebuilding Iraq.  Several key participants in that phase of the Iraq War are easily recognized.  Paul Bremer head of the Coalition Provisional Authority is represented by the character Clark Poundstone, Judith Miller of the New York Times is represented by the character Lawrie Dayne and Ahmed Chalabi appears in the film in the form of Zubaidi.  Viewers interested in how closely this film mirrors actual history should do some background reading on these individuals.<br /><br />Near the top of the end credits we learn that the film was inspired by the book, \\"[[ASIN:0307278832 Imperial Life in the Emerald City]]\\" by Rajiv Chandrasekaran (Washington Post).  This award winning book is a fascinating read and unlike most books of the period doesn't overreach with hype and a crusade for someone to demonize.  Chandrasekaran's observant eye paints a realistic picture of the scene and the CPA's mostly flawed activities.  And let's be clear, there is nothing partisan about finding fault with the CPA's execution of its mission because even the most loyal of Bush supporters have criticised the CPA.  Newt Gingrich is quoted as saying, \\"Bremer is the largest single disaster in American foreign policy in modern times.\\"  Anyone interested in the period should read the book and other historical accounts.<br /><br />The film does a decent job of reflecting the flavor of \\"Emerald City\\" with the absurdities and screw ups.  Dominos pizza is served by the pool in the heart of Baghdad.  American leadership hand picks a new Iraqi leader that has not lived in Iraq for decades and is predictably discredited by other Iraqi leaders.  The army is prematurely disbanded along with many other major social institutions that might have helped organize the rebuilding.<br /><br />The action is OK although I think the chase toward the end is bizarre.  The resolution of the chase was interesting though with what Freddy does and says.  It caps one of the main messages of the film.<br /><br />The bits of preachiness and wacky plot contrivances are disappointments and I think they do an injustice to the book.  But the film still delivers on some action and the big picture of what happened during the time.  This is OK as an action/political thriller but this film is not a great one.  Although based on real people and events, it is still fiction so one has to be careful about what details to absorb from it.<br /><br />I'm glad I watched the film but I'm also glad I didn't buy it.  Being based on a great book boosts this up to 3 stars from me.  I hope it stirs debate and encourages Americans to read the book.The resolution of the chase was interesting though with what Freddy does and says.  It caps one of the main messages of the film.

B001N26GFC|5.0|This is a great movie.  It's different, subtle, positive, and funny.  The supplemental material helps clear up some of the motivation (of the main character, played by Sally Hawkins), but it's great even without that.
B002VPE1B6|4.0|At first I determined not to see AVITAR because James Cameron is a complete ass. But he is a gifted director with a penchant for movies where someone gets in a situation they can't get out of. ALIENS, TITANIC, TERMINATOR -- that sort of thing. I rented the movie and found it was much better than I thought it'd be. The computer generated graphics were impressive, but they didn't get in the way of the story, in my opinion. It was a great balance and the DVD quality is so good that I don't think I'd much care for it in Blu-Ray (I hate putting in a second disk.)<br /><br />If you haven't seen it, yes, I recommend it. But chances are you have, so you be the judge. The DVD is fabulous, though. I wish all DVDs could be this good. Especially STAR WARS, which I've been waiting for for years in high def.
0307454541|5.0|I really did not know what this book was about - I just knew enough people in Europe and America thought it was good enough to be made into a movie (in BOTH places!).  It's a bit slow in the beginning, but I always expect that in books (they do need to give us some necessary background).  But please keep reading, I swear, you will not be able to put it down!

B000MV8AE0|5.0|Let me get to the point. I am a very serious DVD collector. I have over 2,000 DVDs in my collection at present. I try my hardest to watch each and every DVD that I buy. I must admit that \\"Copying Beethoven\\" was one of those DVDs that did not get my interest even though I had bought it. After I bought it, the DVD sat on my shelf for about two years. I watched the other DVDs and passed on \\"Copying Beethoven\\" time and time again. Finally, finally I said to myself I need to watch it and decide if I wanted to keep it or sell it. I was stunned by the magnificent acting, photography of this unexpected gem. I'm not a favorite of classic music but I was mesmerized by this production. It was one of those unexpected surprises. I truly enjoyed this delight. Ed Harris and Diane Kruger were marvelous in their roles.  Treat yourself to this movie!
0688062334|4.0|I read all three stories an enjoyed them for what they are: lighthearted fantasy stories for kids. Howl's Moving Castle is not dark or edgy or complex. It's about a steady young woman and a sorcerer who can be a bit of a diva but is good at heart. There's magic, adventure, battles and plenty of humor. And it teaches that love can prevail- a good lesson for kids to learn these days.
0061478784|5.0|I read this book when I was 10 and loved it,after seeing the movie I was curious to see if the book was as wOnderful as I remembered it. It was so fun to reread it as an adult and I am so excited for when my daughter is old enough and I can pass it on to her.
030726999X|5.0|Great conclusion to a great trilogy.. Here's hoping they can work out the 4th. Stieg will be missed.
074322454X|5.0|Here it is!  The book that started it all!  It launched the wildly popular HBO miniseries \\"Band of Brothers\\" and the dozen or so spin-off books that followed the TV show.  It made household names out of previously unknown soldiers and brought their deeds and sacrifices out of the recesses of history into the light of day.<br /><br />Ambrose's gift was that he was able to empathize with the common GI because he loved them all!  He related to them extremely well, understood them even better and told their stories as well as they could be told.  It says a lot about the man when his subjects refer to their interviewer and semi-biographer as a \\"friend\\".<br /><br />The chronicle of Easy Company of the 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment starts out a year before the regiment joined the 101st Airborne Division.  As an experiment, the regiment was destined to take its basic, weapons and parachute training together as a single unit.  They remained together for 2 years before going into combat.  This elongated training regimen served to bond the men together far more tightly than other units.  It also served to infuse a spirit of camaraderie and brotherhood that was exceptional and unique even among elite units.  They called themselves \\"Toccoa Men\\" after the camp they trained in and \\"Currahee\\" was their motto after the mountain they ran six miles up and down on a regular basis.<br /><br />From its inception with an insidious and demanding commanding officer through four major campaigns through the end of the war, Ambrose weaves a compelling and absorbing account of many of the major players of Easy Company.  Through their nightmares and recollections, he recreates history as seen and felt through these men.  Fully indexed, well written and fast moving, it should be read both before and after viewing the HBO miniseries.  It's an outstanding book, one of the very few that I have read four times!<br /><br />John E. Nevola<br />Author of The Last Jump - A Novel of World War II

0156027321|4.0|I loved the first and last third of this book. A fresh voice of a boy with an inspiring view on our world of religion opens the book, and closes it..... but what happened in the middle?  It seems Martel got too caught up in the gore and survival to remember how he made the reader fall in love in with his character.    Beside this fatal flaw, this book is 5-star deserving.
B00000IMTE|3.0|Ritchie Blackmore is smokin' with his first post-Deep Purple album.  Understated guitar, but melodious.  Strong enough hard-rock elements to satisfy his Purple followers.  The beginning of his Renaissance obsession post-Rainbow, with 16th Century Green Sleeves.  Standout songs Man From the Silver Mountain and Catch the Rainbow.  I highly recommend that you purchase the Universal Japan SHDM version.  You will need to crank the volume, but the music is nearly distortion-free on that.  It's worth the money if you are a fan of Blackmore.
B003QI95Y0|5.0|I bought the original pressing of \\"From Beale Street to Oblivion\\" on the first day it was released. It stayed in my car for at least 4 months, becoming my favorite Clutch album in the process. It had the perfect blend of rocky/psychedelic/blues that I just loved. The new release on Weathermaker Records includes new and expanded artwork which tops the original with a digi-pack design and very cool booklet. The live tracks on the second disk are awesome, as only Clutch can be live. I look forward to the re-release of \\"Robot Hive/ Exodus\\", as I've heard is coming. Hopefully it will be just as cool.
B002ZG9788|4.0|This movie was much better then the original with Harry Hamlin. I am not sure Sam Worthington would have been my choice as Pursius but he did pretty good.<br /><br />This movie wasn't the love story of the original, and for that i am greatful. I hate love stories, and this is a guy flick with swords and no love story was needed<br /><br />the scenery and special effects are fabulous. the action wasn't always there in your face, but there was enough. you do need time for breathing in between battles.<br /><br />The story was as strong as any other. Mother compares her beautful daughter to a goddess and curses the town. the reluctent hero has to find a way to save it. first by finding the evil witches that eat human flesh to find out you have to find Medusa who will turn any male to stone in order to kill the Kracken.<br /><br />ok, so it isn't the STRONGEST of stories, but it is there and the sword play (which is what i wanted to begin with) was pleanty. The only reason i didn't give it 5 stors is it could have been better. where were all the mythical monsters? I wanted to see a battle with a hydra.

0307454541|1.0|... to waste on reading this turgid book. I was bored by the poorly drawn characters - in fact I was so bored I only read half of it.  The author made no attempt to draw the reader into his book - although that might have been the fault of the wooden translation - I felt no desire to find out more about the plot or characters. But then so many of my friends have almost raved over it. I just don't understand this at all. Oh well, meat and poison, as the saying goes but as far as I'm concerned this is the worse book I've (tried to) read for months.
B002YJUC8A|5.0|Everyone will enjoy this book. Some...will love it. This is a book for chefs, foodies, or anyone with a general love for cooking. Bourdain will take you on an adrenaline soaked ride into the culinary underbelly. Trade secrets, shortcuts, and things you DON'T want to know. (and some you do)  Hilarious stories and misadventures abound. A MUST read. I highly recommend Kitchen Confidential for ANY reader...but especially for those who are hooked on the lifestyle, and the culture of food. You know who you are.

B000A7DVR2|4.0|This movie is completely ridiculous, but in a good way.<br />My boyfriend was watching it while I was playing on the computer, but it was so entertaining that I ended up turning my game off and watching it.<br />I definitely would consider this movie a win for the Coen Bros. You get the same intelligent humor that appears in Fargo, without the dark plot. Definitely an ecclectic cast that fits together nicely.

0312370849|4.0|When I go on vacation it usually is to a good beach with a book in hand.  This is one of those books which I found hard to put down, so I found myself essentially in heaven.  The book is written from the perspective of an 10-year-old Jewish girl during WWI and an American who presently lives in Paris.Its a sad story, but well told - the only thing lacking is that I thought the ending was rushed and wanted more.  Its a good book, one I would rate a 4 because of the ending, but I have recommended it to others.

0307346617|4.0|This is one of books I took for a beach read. When I go on vacation, I really don't want to have to think or focus to might. The book is entertaining, thought it very cleverly written and it was an easy read on the beach.  Kudos to Max Brooks for finding a niche for himself.  The book is basically a no-brainer, but a good one if you are into Zombies.
B000JML7EC|3.0|I was slightly disappointed with this book.  Hard to decipher the sailor lingo for one thing, even though I knew some of it.  But also the plot was...unlikely.  But, it seems likely a decent enough book for a young teen.  Since I acquired an almost free copy of the book, I had to read it, having read Mr. Hyde.  I did like some parts of the book, and Long John Silver was one character that kept it going pretty strong.  His parrot was also a high point and should've played a more active role, albeit inane tidbits. But, as I say, if what you're reading seems improbable, and you're asking yourself why am I wasting my time reading this, it's hard to rate the book more than three stars.  But then, the author is pushing daisies and he doesn't care.  haha

B003E48AYC|4.0|i wasn't going to buy this video,however i kept getting put down further in the wait list for netflix to mail it out to me so i found this copy being sold by a dealer at a price i simply could not turn down. even walmart wanted nearly $40.00 with tax and i got this copy for around $22.00. i have the blue ray for my use and i can still loan the dvd copy around to my friends.<br />  about the movie, in the movie house it was abit disappointing only because i wear glasses and it really interfered with the 3d experience. i watched it at home with my system and no 3d and i really had to reconsider my rating for it. i picked up alot of the audio,especially the dialog between the mad hatter and alice, i really believe that by not focusing so much on the 3d experience, it allowed me to really get more into the story and explained alot more to me.<br />  i was kind of critical with my first review in IMDB but will go back now and update it for fairness.<br />  not sure i would spend $40.00 but it is definately worth at least $25.00

B0015DROBO|4.0|\\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" has obviously become a huge best-seller...a bit of a sensation really.  Like many books of this type, the hype often gets out of control and reader expectations skyrocket, which seems to be the case here.  Numerous people recommended the book to me, and all seemed to think it was brilliant.  I was eager to finally read it, as I am a fan of Scandinavian mystery novels, such as the Martin Beck series.  Unfortunately, I thought that \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" was good but not the masterpiece some seem to think it is.<br /><br />If you can overlook the hype, then it's a highly readable, solid mystery novel.  As noted by many other reviewers, the book probably could have used some judicious editing and tightening.  In particular, details about Lisbeth's background and life are parsed out over and over again, becoming highly repetitive and not really adding much new.  I felt the same way about details given for other characters as well.  On the other hand, it's hard to knock a book for providing character development, especially in a genre where it is so often lacking.  Plus, I did end up actually caring about the two lead characters, which again is not always the case with mystery novels.  The other main issue I had with the novel is that I didn't really become very invested in the main plot/mystery until about halfway through, when the pieces started to merge.  Getting through the first half was a bit of a chore, but the book did improve significantly after that.<br /><br />In the end, I liked but did not love \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.\\"  The novel could have been shortened and not lost anything crucial.  However, the book did intrigue me enough that I immediately downloaded the next one in the series onto my Kindle.  I guess getting me invested in the characters worked.
0307341550|4.0|As indicated by the blurbs on the back cover of Gillian Flynn's 'Sharp Objects,' the novel is difficult to put down once you start reading it. The characterizations are sharply etched, with Camille (the protagonist and narrator), Amma (Camille's half sister), and Camille's mother, Adora, especially acutely described. The descriptions of life and environs of southeast Missouri are vivid, although somewhat unflattering-- Ms. Flynn suggests throughout that the residents of southeast Missouri are either rednecks, 'white trash,' or snobbish elites. Anyone who has ever been to southeast Missouri or southwest Illinois will recognize *some* of that, but, again, the overall portrait of the residents is not admiring.  The weakest part of the book is the climax. The revelation of the perpetrator of double murder that is the focus of the plot will catch the reader by surprise. Up until the end, Ms. Flynn brilliantly aims the focus of the police investigation first at one logical suspect, then another. Once the true offender is divulged, this reader was bemused that (i) the plotting gave little evidence that this person commited the double homicide; and, (ii) since the police and an otherwise-proficient detective 'on loan' from Kansas City did not suspect the killer either, one surmises that there were no 'clues.' Given the perpetrator's relative youth, the 'no clues' undertone struck me as implausible.
0307454541|4.0|Mikael Blomkvist, investigative journalist and owner of Millennium magazine, is on top of his world. He's just published a hard hitting series of sensational financial articles exposing the staggering corruption of Swedish banker, Hans Wennerstrom, and his star is in the ascendant until Wennerstrom drags him into the courtroom and wins a devastating criminal suit for libel. Blomkvist's world looks bleak as he faces three months in prison and a fine that threatens to take down everything he has ever achieved in his life.<br /><br />When reclusive multi-millionaire Henrik Vanger offers to pay him a ridiculous amount of money to find his neice who disappeared under mysterious circumstances over thirty years ago, the opportunity seems heaven sent. Put in a legitimate if token effort for one year attempting to solve a mystery that has eluded the best efforts of any mind that has thought about it, serve a three month term in prison that will almost certainly be shortened by parole and pay off the fine with the money that Vanger wants to throw at him.<br /><br />In the course of his investigation of this mystery (murder, kidnapping or runaway ... no one really knows which), Blomkvist meets Lisbeth Salander - a skinny, hard-edged but attractive, on-again off-again feminist; a tattoed punk wild child with bisexual tendencies; an extraordinary computer hacker and skilled journalistic researcher with a photographic memory; a skilled boxer; a survivor of child abuse whose difficult memories of rape and sexual assault have turned into an abiding hatred and a desire for revenge on misognynists.<br /><br />Together, the unlikely pairing of Blomkvist and Salander drag the skeletons out of the Vanger family closet and then turn their sights back onto the Wennerstrom financial empire to re-write the devastating financial article that caused such a stir. Only this time, Blomkvist's going to do it right and find the proofs and the smokings guns that will leave absolutely no room for a rebuttal in the courts.<br /><br />If Lisbeth Salander isn't the most bizarre and off-the-wall literary character ever created, she'd certainly be a front-runner in any ranking. THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO is a gutsy, hard-driving psychological thriller with a convoluted plot and a brilliant cast of richly, developed characters. It's a long novel, to be sure, but the writing is so rich, the plot is so deep, the dialogue is so convincing, and the characters are so twisted, that turning the pages deep into the wee hours just seems to happen all by itself.<br /><br />THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO is many things. On the surface, it's a provocative, complex mystery that is more than exciting enough to justify reading and enjoying an extraordinarily long novel. Slightly below the surface, we have a number of cautionary tales on topics as disparate as sexual abuse, the abuse of trust by those in a position of power and, finally, the confounding ethics of legitimate journalism. The side story of Salander's revenge on Nils Bjurman, the court-appointed trustee over Salander's financial affairs, is a bizarre combination of poignancy and jaw-dropping graphic violence that will simply take your breath away.<br /><br />Highly recommended. But be warned ... once you start, be sure to clear your calendar. Because you won't want to stop.<br /><br />Paul WeissIf Lisbeth Salander isn't the most bizarre and off-the-wall literary character ever created, she'd certainly be a front-runner in any ranking.

0545140315|4.0|I wish I had a club like this in high school. Heck, I wish I had this club in college! Penny's story is one that resonates with a lot of girls. Who hasn't been rejected or hurt by a boy? And the best people to turn to when you've got relationship problems are your friends.     The novel beings with Penny discovering her boyfriend cheating on her. She vows to stop dating boys in high school because all they seem to do is lie, cheat, and use you. She plans to enjoy being single. Not long The Lonely Heats Club goes from one member to a group of girls at school who want to start focusing on themselves and not on boys. However, things start to get complicated when Penny starts falling for Ryan. She has to confront her fears of getting hurt again and ask if she's willing to take a chance on Ryan, and whether as the leader of The Lonely Hearts Club, she's going to break her own vow to stop dating.     The story is sweet and I love how it emphasizes friendship. The club's get-togethers felt really genuine and I wanted to hop in the book and sit around with them watching movies and dishing the dirt on boys. The Beatles heavily influence the story too as they inspire a lot of Penny's actions and I thought the author did a fantastic job of incorporating the songs. And, come on, who doesn't like The Beatles? This book was cute, and in the end, it warmed my heart.     (Oh, and I must say I loved that in this book Penny's parents had her back. I'm glad there's YA novels out there that showcase parents supporting their children.)
B00364K6YW|3.0|We have this 1995 version on VHS, the original DVD release and, unfortunately the \\"new\\" DVD version. The Pride and Prejudice story speaks for itself. I speak to the video creators. What is wrong with the people who produce videos for public release?  First the VHS is beautiful to look at and draws you in instantly... until you have to change tapes every 55 minutes... all SIX of them!! We all know that VHS tape could hold recordings for as long as 8 hours... here we only need about 5 1/2 hours. The story could have easily been represented on a maximum of 2 VHS tapes! Second, the first DVD release is as others have said, washed out and \\"blue\\" toned.  However the creators briefly got sensible and realized that fans DO NOT want to have the story chopped up and give us a 2-disc run with 3 episodes each smoothly relating the story without \\"Protecting\\" the directors vision by inserting every single beginning and ending of each episode vainly and pompously listing them and their \\"accomplishments\\".  Once is enough. Third, the latest DVD issue returns to STUPID! You get 2 DVDs with every single break between episodes with all the listings for all of the directors, writers and producers at the beginning and end. The first DVD in this version ends awkwardly and you pick up the end of the story with disc 2. You cannot even select a \\"PLAY ALL\\" option to have the story just play out as you watch. Disc 2 is a WASTE!  As a fan, I am NOT interested in more information on the director, producers, writers than there is story!!!  When are these pompous, vain people going to get a clue?!?  I want the STORY... simple, without interruption, with clarity and logically. The extra \\"making of\\" JUNK should have been put on a disc by itself.  Also, disc 1 has so much of the story on it, it is quite possible that if the DVD creators has NOT felt compelled to include all of the introduction and ending credits, the WHOLE story could have been included on ONE DVD!!!!  OMG what a concept!  The storyfor the story's sake!     I will wait until the price of DVD recorders drops, put in my VHS and record it on a DVD myself.  ONE introduction, ONE ending credits listing and 99% story with great color and ambience!
B001SWQYGI|5.0|I bought this headphone amp because the new flat-screen TV had a line stereo output, and I needed to use headphones at night. (The line audio was too weak to adequately power the headphones.) The sound I get from the amp-headphone combo is better and more life-like than the TV's speakers.    I'd recommend this amp to anyone.

B002VECLVO|5.0|Perfect film in every way.  Visually stunning peak at a private sorrow never done better.  No one can give this type of performance better than Colin Firth.  For those who don't know his range I recommend, Fever Pitch (the original English version), you can probably get it in Canada (Amazon), Apartment Zero and A Month in the Country.  Only then can one really appreciate his range.  Pride and Prejudice may have exposed him to the US audience but he can play everyman and any man.
0446613444|3.0|This is Michael Connelly's second published novel. This story, similar to Black Echo, started slowly and took a while to build momentum, but then it hit a narrative lull just before the DEA staged its raid. Where Black Echo kicked into gear, this story started to idle. Police procedure detail suddenly switched to DEA procedural detail and it was distracting to me. I started skimming over a lot of paragraphs, searching for where the story regained momentum. The bull attacking the helicopter in the middle of the night was sort of an unbelievable laugher and I thought it was one-hundred percent not believable.  I was disappointed that I figured out the guy was still alive before Harry Bosch did. From the very beginning the one option that got little consideration was the possibility that Calexico Moore was still alive - and it was an obvious option that I would expect Harry Bosch to strongly consider. One of the things I liked about Black Echo was that Harry Bosch figured out the clues before I did, but not so in this story. The demise of the antagonist was also a little too clichéd -- not very creative -- I saw it coming all the way from Los Angeles. Overall, an okay read but somewhat of a letdown after Black Ice.
B000002JSP|1.0|I am a huge Zep fan but, when this album came out my friend and I thought it was a joke by the radio station that was playing it for the first time. We couldnt believe that Zep could make anything this bad. In the Evening is the only song that resembles the greatness of Led Zep. Avoid this album at all cost. Physical Graffiti, Presence, I, II, IV are much better than this pile of crap. Even III and Houses of the Holy are better but are not great albums. Take it from a Zep freak and not a Zep hater this album sucks.

B000TETD9Q|5.0|After carefully checking out all the Beach Boys greatest hits albums, and listening to the samples, I downloaded this MP3 album. After listening to the album, I'm happy that I chose this one (Sounds Of Summer). It has 30 songs, most being their radio hits. All in all, I still think this is the best Beach Boys greatest hits album available and very good sounding. In my view the only thing that would make this an absolutely perfect album is if \\"Wild Honey\\", \\"Getcha Back\\", \\"Heroes and Villains\\", \\"Good Timin'\\", and \\"Darlin'\\" were replaced with \\"Wendy\\", \\"Catch A Wave\\", \\"All Summer Long\\", \\"Little Honda\\", and \\"409\\". Also if \\"Fun, Fun, Fun\\", \\"Don't Worry Baby\\", and \\"Help Me Rhonda\\" were remastered in stereo, instead of mono. That being said, I still think that it is a 5 star album and their best greatest hits album.

B0013N3DSE|5.0|If you already have the 2003 DVD edition, then you do not need the Blue Ray.  But if don't already own this movie then the $10 for the Blue Ray edition is worth it. I did not see any real differences other than maybe picture and sound were a little crisper.  The movie itself is a good representative of Hollywood's true golden years.  Flynn and De Havilland made one of the best Hollywood couples.  Would like to see a set put together of their eight movies.
B001HN69AE|5.0|This movie is a lot of fun for the whole family, with a great cast, great acting, and a great story. The FX are done well, and the plot feels complete.    My whole family loves the animated series: Dragon Ball, Dragon Ball Z, Dragon Ball GT, and we love this movie as well. But, you cannot watch this movie expecting it to be a faithful recreation of Dragon Ball, the animated series. If you're expecting to see the animated series in the form of a movie, you'll be disappointed like the majority of reviewers on here.    We're really hoping they make Dragonball 2: Reborn!

0307454541|4.0|I read this book because of all the hype about it. Actually I purchased all three novels in the series and have just finished reading the first.<br /><br />I found it very interesting from the point of view that it described life in Sweden exceptionally well but from the serial killer mystery adventure point of view, the author waited too long until he got into the mystery and solving it.<br /><br />The middle of the bok was five star in my opinion since it dwelt with the disappearance and the revelation that Harriet's disappearance revolved around a string of serial killings unraveled by the reporter and the research assistant (the girl with the dragon tattoo).<br /><br />Overall, it was worth the read and I intend to pursue the other two after I gulp down the latest Daniel Silva offering.
B00009P1O0|5.0|Update- May 16, 2012.<br /><br />I apologize for the negative review.  I was pretty hard on this album two years ago.  I was probably suffering from an ingrown toenail infection (a recurring problem of mine) while writing that review and wasn't in the best of moods.  In fact I distinctly remember I was suffering from one of those.  Nasty little stressful problem.  I remember it came back after only two months despite all the pain and trauma I put myself through.  I didn't care for that.  Yeah... I wasn't in the proper state of mind to comment on anything that day, much less a Neil Young album.  Now I'm having a problem with my upper left molar resulting in constant migraines and cracking cheekbones.  I just can't win.  God apparently doesn't want me to listen to On the Beach without any painful problems.  Nice.  Either way, ignore the negative tone of my review below.  I actually love On the Beach and, with a pack of ice on my left cheekbone and an urgent surgery appointment on the horizon, the album is now 5 solid stars.<br /><br />Neil Young has always been wildy inconsistent throughout his career, and On the Beach is no exception.  This album contains a few really memorable songs as well as a couple filler tracks.<br /><br />It bugs me a little bit that the biggest reason most people love On the Beach so much is because for several years (before 2003) it has built a reputation as being \\"a lost classic never released on CD\\".  It all honesty, this album isn't even better than Harvest, or even one of Neil Young's other mellow late 70's offerings for that matter.<br /><br />It sure starts off on a really high note though!  \\"Walk On\\" is a *perfect* little pop song with a great vocal melody.  I love it.  As soon as track two however, some of Neil Young's more bland and predictable songwriting habits rear their ugly head once again.  \\"See the Sky\\" is WAY too boring for my liking.<br /><br />Unless you have an obsession with Neil Young's more tender emotional ballads that sound completely stuck in the mid 70's, you won't like this song very much.  There must be thousands of songs released in 1974 that sound exactly like this one.<br /><br />I think what bugs me the most about this track is that it sounds like a bad imitation of Crosby, Stills and Nash.  Had that band still been together by this point in time, and with Neil Young contributing of course, this track could have been something amazing.  As it stands, it's just pretty forgettable.<br /><br />\\"Revolution Blues\\" is a magnificant song though.  The lyrics are solid, and even though I initially hated the clumsy way the vocal melody was put together, I have learned to appreciate it.<br /><br />Again though, the title song is written remarkably similar to \\"See the Sky\\" and loses a bit of steam.  At least I like this vocal melody a LOT more than the one in \\"See the Sky\\".  I don't see how it's supposed to be one of the most beautifully written songs of all-time however.  It's good enough for being just another inoffensive and dated-sounding mellow track, but that's about the only positive thing I can say about it, I'm afraid.<br /><br />\\"Vampire Blues\\" has funny lyrics, but not a particularly interesting attempt at the blues style.  Seek Eric Clapton for better blues (and guitar playing).  Clapton never would have written such a clumsy guitar solo during his classic years either.<br /><br />\\"Motion Pictures\\" wouldn't be out of place on pretty much any number of Young's OTHER soft country rock albums.  It's pretty enough, but nothing remarkable or anything.  The lyrics are relatively bland too.  I can think of several Neil tracks over the years that fall under the same category.  You know, where the vocal melody and the lyrics are good enough to put down on tape, but never truly blowing you away.<br /><br />The obvious highlight is \\"Ambulance Blues\\".  A 9-minute ride into a lyrical journey and covering a lot of adventurous territory in the process- *these* are the kind of songs Ibelieve captures Neil Young's talent better than anything else he does (yes, these songs are more interesting than even his lengthy guitar jams with Crazy Horse, but just *barely*).<br /><br />I still believe On the Beach wouldn't be receiving so many positive reviews had it been released on CD from the get go, because then people wouldn't be making such a big deal over how underrated it is.  It's just another Neil Young album to me.  His best albums are still Rust Never Sleeps, After the Gold Rush, and Everybody Knows This is Nowhere.

B002RI9PKO|4.0|Like other bestsellers Blink and Tipping point, Malcom Gladwell has written compelling stories. He has tried to find out what makes people successful. This book is not about how to be successful, but tells about how opportunities and legacy play role in life of successful people. This book is more about the circumstances where one has little control over and how these circumstances affect us, Except 10,000 hour rules, which explains how hard work and persistence is more important than intelligence and innate talent.<br />Most of us already have vague understanding, how opportunities and legacy shape the peopleâ(tm)s destiny but we cannot deny the fact that Outliers use sheer force of their passion and will power to convert adversities into opportunities. Nevertheless Malcom has not contested role of will power and other important principles which makes somebody outstanding. I also like the idea of ~Power distance Index(tm). Reading this book was pleasure.
B002C6K7N0|5.0|This album almost sounds like Master of Puppets during brief periods, with some RIP and PS. The music is so fast, and the message reflects what many have been feeling politically for some time, and more are beginning to share those views. It's interesting to watch Dave's political messages change over the past twenty years.      I also think this is a great album for those who have been clamoring for the return of the RIP days. In terms of metal, some have equated aging musicians with a slowing down of their music; if that's the case then Dave has broken the mold.
B000005YZM|5.0|I purchased this album on March 18th after buying the Zombie Heaven box set, and fell in love with it immediately.  As a newcomer to the group, I can honestly say I love most everything about them in every phase of their short-lived 60s career, but nothing prepared me for this opus of extraordinary richness and depth.  It is like taking a deep inhalation of breath for 70 minutes, and exhaling at last with the knowledge that you have inhaled the scent of something so unique and euphoric that mere words cannot describe the pleasure of the experience.<br /><br />Be it mono or stereo, I listen to the entire thing raptly, and can never fully take in the brilliance of what has been experienced (okay, it's still really blowing my mind).  Don't want to do another Forever Changes, but here goes anyway:<br /><br />\\"Care of Cell 44:\\"  Bright, poppy tune about the anticipation of someone returning to society soon.  Rather insecure study, as our person on the outside wants to believe things will be alright.  This remains to be seen...<br /><br />\\"A Rose for Emily:\\" Lovely delicate piece about a spinster who will probably die without even a cat to mourn her.  Enchantingly neo-classical, but very pointedly moody and contemplative.<br /><br />\\"Maybe After He's Gone:\\"  Quietly epic and understatedly desperate.  Yeah, I've been there too.  Didn't happen for me either, but can relate to the earnestness.<br /><br />\\"Beechwood Park:\\"  Lovely fictional Chris White piece about an old girls school that got him in trouble with a head mistress.  Nice tremelo guitar and sweet harmonies.<br /><br />\\"Brief Candles:\\"  Oh, so near and dear to my heart.  \\"Her sadness makes her smile.\\"  Alternating vocals that weave a web of depressing, yet magical aura.<br /><br />\\"Hung Up On a Dream:\\"  My absolute favorite track on this album, inspired by the art of meditation.  Such a gloriously, well-layered piece of \\"psychedelic\\" pop(This album is NOT psychedelic, though most people think so.  The Zombies were not drug users!), and so breath-takingly gorgeous I can't believe how overlooked this album is for this song alone!<br /><br />\\"Changes:\\"  Stellar acapella performance of a poetic commentary on people who become someone else once they become wealthy.  These guys certainly weren't, and there were stories of people moving pianos about while they were recording this track at Abbey Road.<br /><br />\\"I Want Her, She Wants Me:\\"  Sounds more like a leftover from the British beat material, except the harpsichord and folk edge save it from being dated for this album.<br /><br />\\"This Will Be Our Year:\\"  Delightful bit of romantic pop fluff that reminds me of some of the forecoming Colin Blunstone solo works.  Makes me swoon just thinking about it.<br /><br />\\"Butcher's Tale (Western Front 1914):\\"  For the last time, this is not a reference to Vietnam, hence the title, although I can see the allusions.  Creepy, dark, reference to flies on corpses does not exactly do anything for me!<br /><br />\\"Friends of Mine:\\"  A song naming personal friends who are so happily in love.  Catchy and bright, at first I thought, god, I wouldn't be happy if all my other friends were in love while I'm lonely and down.  Colin says his \\"Aah!...\\" at the end was to rebuff some of that appearance, and rightly so!<br /><br />\\"Time of the Season:\\"  Undisputed jazz fusion classic, and the forerunner to future Argent projects.  Colin originally hated this song, \\"but now he likes it.\\"  Might as well, bud, because you're stuck doing it forever!  Great keyboards by Rod Argent, and Colin's vocal is so cool and sexy, who would have guessed?<br /><br />All in all, I cannot even begin to do this masterpiece justice, and have been dragging my heels on it.  All I can say is, you must own this because it is an absolute paragon.  Worthy of your time, you will never stop listening to it if you pick it up.  God only knows that after a few months, I'm going to need a few more copies.  Enjoy, and I sincerely mean that!an't believe how overlooked this album is for this song alone!    \\"Changes:\\"  Stellar acapella performance of a poetic commentary on people who become someone else once they become wealthy.

B0009UC810|1.0|The product failed to perform. It simply stopped midway through a scene. I now see that it was a two sided disc which would have been nice to know when I purchased it.  I returned the product as defective to the manufacturer as instructed and asked that I be credited for product and shipping. I have still not heard a word.    Very dissatisfied with my first Amazon experience.
B0000024UH|5.0|I'd heard one or two tracks on the radio, eg \\"Evil Ways\\" on BBC Radio One and \\"Soul Sacrifice\\" on a French radio station (as music to use in the run-up to the news on the hour - well at least the French played a bit of Soul Sac; we Brits never did at all at the time!!). So I already knew that I was on to something very, very special. I first heard the whole album on a pair of stereo headphones in the then record dept of Harrods in about 1972 after it would have been out for some three years. My reaction - I just could not believe that music could be so good! To put it mildly! I shall never forget that experience of hearing the whole album for the first time.    There was not just the beat of drums; there were congas, bongos, timbales !! So exotic and the perfect antidote to a grey London morning. And that hammond organ! And That Guitar, plugged into That Socket marked \\"GOD\\"!!     I made my purchase straightaway, and \\"Santana - First\\" has remained my joint favourite album (with \\"Melting Pot\\" by Booker T and the MGs) ever since by any artist.
B002XHN776|3.0|30 Seconds to Mars. What comes to your mind? Rock? Metal? This album takes a really different approach to the band's style. What you have is an album that will make you ears bleed at parts and wanting more at the same time.    The problem is Jared Leto's voice. Since they added more electronic style to this album there's just something wrong with it. He screams. Almost whiningly. It doesn't stand out in the band's previous albums with regards to the screaming. Like if I listen to the kill it's fine. Somehow the music style in this album makes my ears bleed any time he starts screaming. It's PERFECTLY FINE when he's in a calm voice, but if you listen to a song from this album on youtube you will understand what I mean.    Unfortunately what they've done is taken a style that's meant to be calm and tried to make it somewhat feel \\"chaotic\\" with the screaming, but all it ends up being is a bloody mess.

B000YAA68W|5.0|I can hardly recall a movie as complex yet easy to follow as this one.  I like the message a lot, and I do can feel the pain from the main character.  I would say my favorite character is the grand mother.  Is a perfect representation of freedom and happyness among tough times and repression.
0439023491|5.0|An equally dramatic book to the first one. It pulls you in and spits you out with an ending that makes it impossible to wait for the third. Definitely worth the time and read.
B00003CY6M|5.0|I just love this movie, it's a fairy tale come ture and I belive in real life things like this can really happen, if you love a good romance then you will love this movie with John Cusack and Kate Beckisale
0439023483|4.0|This was a great book. Written well, with a great story line that pulls you in. Definitely worth taking the time to read.
B003CH9PV8|5.0|This is the best show on television and the best acting. Anyone who knows Bryan Cranston as the doofus dad from Malcom in the Middle will be in awe when seeing this. The Character of Walt White is deep, convoluted and played to perfection by Mr.Cranston. The rest of the cast is fantastic too and we're presented with some of the baddest bad guys ever. If you are a late comer toBreaking Bad, you should startfrom  the beginning because though episodes can probably stand on theirown, the show is mostly about the journey ofthis nice guy kind of loser, to \\"the dark side.\\" If you are a teacher or have kids, lots of opportunity for discussion - when is it justifiable to do bad things?
1423101472|4.0|This book did a great job of maintaining the mythological aspect of the book while intertwining the story. Very Well written and worth taking the time to read.
0739499963|3.0|It was a little boring specially where a few chapters were just explaining how things went in Irag and characters that didn't have anything to do with the rest of the story but it's worth reading overall ... I kind of liked it.
1572815108|4.0|Everything is utterly amazing in this deck. The imagery is stunning, and most definitely contain secrets of the Golden Dawn that would not appear in the Universal Waite deck. HOWEVER, there is a misprint with the Lust trump card, and the Adjustment trump card. The numbers are switched, I don't know about the rest of you but this was enough to kill the accuracy of my deck. I can't read it correctly knowing that it has a misprint in it.
B000I186FW|5.0|Rarely do you find an action movie that combines good acting, a well developed plot and characters, excellent effects, and a thought provoking message. V for Vendetta has all of those in full measure. Highly recommended.
0143118420|5.0|There are two books all women should read (men can benefit, too!) as they begin their life's journey--or are stuck along the way: [[ASIN:141690977X He's Just Not That Into You: The No-Excuses Truth to Understanding Guys]] and Eat, Pray, Love.  Eat, Pray, Love is wonderful: funny, enlightening and inspirational.  I loved this book.  I related to so much of what Gilbert went through and wish I could have taken the journey that she took--even for a little while.  She is a very brave woman.
B0038QGXHW|5.0|Beautiful, simple, and absolutely elegant performances here of several old classics ... this album is an excellent follow-on if you enjoyed \\"The Melody at Night, With You\\".  I second the comments of reviewer SF_Musician above who noted that he is \\"not one of those people who thinks that everything Jarrett does is great ... but this is -- \\"    Highly recommended.
B000PDYVVG|2.0|If you want to follow the travels of an incredibly narcisstic individual then this book is for you.  If not, then I suggest passing it up.  The author comes across as shallow and self-serving, especially in the divorce of her husband.  I would love to travel to Italy, India and Bali.  However, I wouldn't divorce my husband and abandon my family to do it.  Finding God and understanding yourself comes from true soul searching, sacrifice, and commitment. This is a typical example of a person who expresses the motto \\"It's all about me!\\"
0156027321|5.0|I had to buy this book for summer reading purposes for 10th grade. I never actually read books because of fun. But this book was rather adventurous and I really liked it, I haven't read many books in my whole life but this was actually very fun to read. If you are buying this for school related purposes, fear not; it's easy to read and also very fun. You wont be tortured with reading this one.
B0021L8V1Q|5.0|This review actually pertains to the movie HAMLET 2, which I've reviewed a number of times and for whatever reason the good people at Amazon.com continually refuse to publish.  And yes, HAMLET 2 is that rare sequel that actually improves upon the original.
B003XU02QG|5.0|If you liked either Black Hawk Down or Gladiator... this is your kind of movie. it's brutal and nonstop action throughout. Great characters and beautiful women. It's everything 300 should've been.
B000XUUQQK|2.0|It's because it sucked. Now it wasn't terrible, but it's just way different from the first movie, and it isn't even a sequel. SPOILERS- Apparently not a lot of people didn't like the first one since the Boogeyman was an actual supernatural creature. The one in this movie was just all psychological. I'm sure that if I had gotten into this movie knowing that it wasn't a sequel to the first movie then I might have given this a higher score.<br /><br /> Before I go into the bad part of this movie, the actual plot was pretty interesting. The writers seemed to know what they were doing when they wrote the film. It was well written, but pretty much a typical slasher movie. This had Tobin Bell in it. I mean c'mon this guy is a pretty good actor, and he was the main bad guy in the Saw movies, so it was nice to see him be the good guy for once. He had a soothing voice, and at one point in the movie it seemed very much like Saw when the girl found a tape recorder that the male doctor (Tobin Bell) had with the main girl's brother. I can't remember their names, but yeah.<br /><br /> However, Boogeyman 2 has a ton of flaws. In my opinion anyways. First off, the title is misleading. It isn't a sequel so they should've renamed it something else like \\"Boogeyman: A Psychological Thriller\\" or something like that. There was also way too much over the top gore. It was so...DISGUSTING! A guy being crushed in half by an elevator hanging upside down, girl cutting open her leg in the bathroom with blood pouring out of the stall in the drain, a guy eating a bag of chips and roaches start coming out (that was disgusting...i don't want to eat another bag of chips again...his death however wasn't too gory). Then the next two (not sequentially since there was the lady who was electricuted) were absolutely disgusting...a guy gets his chest ripped open by some crazy tool, and a girl is hooked up to a bunch of crap and blegh. I thought there was going to be some gore in this since Tobin Bell was init, but not this much! I had to peek through my hand for all those gross scenes. It was disgusting...do not try to eat while watching this movie!<br /><br />I personally liked the first one better, since it was interesting and the guy was transported through the closets. Anyways, I wasn't looking for a psychological thriller from this one, and it just wasn't my cup of tea.
1843117592|5.0|[[VIDEOID:moGZDLOD9HL0A]]<br />DO YOU WANT TO GO FIRST?<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />This is a delightful and useful book in the current policy climate for primacy of ADR here in the UK as a device when sorting out contentious matters.<br /><br />We have always felt that mediation is really about common sense and Cyril Chern's \\"International Commercial Mediation\\" fulfils this task brilliantly in 15 chapters littered with samples and examples of what we need when mediating.  A CD ROM would be a useful additional tool in what is a great ADR guide for all involved in sorting out arguing parties.<br /><br />The book starts with a short history of mediation as a method of dispute resolution worldwide although author Cyril Chern's task is to expand the little that has been written about how to mediate and what techniques can be applied to obtain a successful result. Also, little has been written about how to deal with large, complex international commercial disputes and how they are effectively administered.  Here, Chern provides the knowledge necessary for those actively involved with ADR as well as those needing to learn the process for membership of the Chartered Institute of Arbitrators or the requisite courses for lawyers.<br /><br />In his Preface, Chern highlights two examples of mediation in North America from Toronto and California. Both were successful and form the basis of the book as the result of his experiences... and which we are suitably grateful for as he is a rightly acknowledged expert.<br /><br />The questions he raises are the best checklist of what we need to look for:<br /><br />* How does any mediator know what is the best way to approach any dispute?<br />* How does the average mediator know what techniques may work better or what forms and procedures are better than the ones currently used?<br />* What new methods for effective dispute resolution are available and how are these best out to use?<br /><br />The book is a summary of Chern's expertise in arbitration, mediation and adjudication across the world and gives this useful pointer- each of us develops their own particular style, procedures and methods and, with mediator training courses, new mediators are at least taught a method of mediation that can be successful.<br /><br />In other words the tricks of the trade are unveiled although we have always thought that mediation has \\"an individuality\\" about it because no two cases (or parties) will ever be the same.<br /><br />For those starting out on the mediator road, do look at how Tomlin orders are covered at page 190 and see the excellent samples set out including the Scott Schedule (page 157) and the various draft agreements throughout the book which makes it so valuable to the advocate mediator.<br /><br />Mediation has been with us since the beginning so it predates written history although scholars disagree as to when the first known example of mediation actually occurred.<br />One thing is clear, in a new age when we may be returning to litigation as a last resort rather than a first resort, the polite question `do you want to go first?' will always set the scene for a successful attempt at mediation as the initial courtesy can disarm the belligerent at the outset... and you will need Chern's guide at the outset, too, for its sage advice and calmness of thought.pertise in arbitration, mediation and adjudication across the world and gives this useful pointer- each of us develops their own particular style, procedures and methods and, with mediator training courses, new mediators are at least taught a method of mediation that can be successful.

0312370849|2.0|I wanted to like this book, the subject matter is important and I was very interested in this bit of lesser known history of the holocaust.  However the author's writing style was juvenile and boring, I felt like I was reading something a high school student would write.  I felt nothing for the characters, they never became \\"real\\" to me.  Such an interesting topic delivered in such a boring way.
B003ITZBW2|3.0|The movie itself would get 10 stars, don't get me wrong!    This review is specifically for the two disc special edition ONLY!    The Jonah Hex short is amazing, but I've heard DC is soon releasing all the shorts in a collection with a brand new Captain Marvel one. If Jonah isn't on the single disc for Red Hood, wait until the Showcase collection.    The Dick Grayson as Robin documentary was what made me buy the two disc edition. The documentary wasn't good at all. It does not cover the character of Robin or Nightwing in depth, does not cover the character's appearances in other media (from the 1940s serials to the cartoons of the 1960s through Batman Brave & Bold...not even Batman TAS!).    The two Robin episodes are nice (Robin's Reckoning Parts 1 & 2), but if you have the complete series of Batman TAS you don't need them.    The Robin documentary mostly covers the psychology of the sidekick, and the psychology of comparing Batman to Robin and how they deal with parental loss differently.    I'm telling you, as a fan of DC Documentaries as special features this is a dud. The 18 minute long Supergirl documentary in the Smallville Season 7 boxset was more comprehensive! The 14 minute Plastic Man history with the 1980s animated series DVD set was even more comprehensive! Seriously, Robin deserved a better documentary, not even his time with the Teen Titans in the comics was mentioned!    I don't recommend buying the two disc set if you were only doing so for that Robin documentary!
0316017922|2.0|caution, this review contains spoilers.    good book, presented one original idea: it takes about ten thousand hours of practice to be really good at something.  everything else is just pretty obvious.  mitigated speech and tiredness causing plane crashes, tradition of Chinese work ethic developed from centuries of working on rice patties(which required three times harder work than any other crop in the world), jews getting good at a form of law practice shunned by the gentiles and getting rich later after the practice became lucrative.    Everything is all very logical.  So the only pearl in the book is that it takes about ten thousand hours of practice to master something.  I plan to at least partially master investments by studying 16 hours a day for two and a half years, yay, thanks for the info.    The author said a bunch of junior canadian hockey players were born in the beginning of the year because the cut off birth date for team selection is new years day.  Thus young kids who are older by a better part of the year were stronger, bigger, faster and more likely to be chosen.  My question is, since this book is about outliers, why didn't the author focus on the few who made the team that was born at the end of the year(about ten percent i think) and focus on the reason they made the team.  Did their talent overcome their fate?    Other than the ten thousand hour finding, the book was honestly a waste of time.  I hope my honest review was worth and will save your precious time.
B003ITZBVI|2.0|Once again, I was duped by the \\"digital copy\\" offer.  For $19.99, I was supposedly getting the blu-ray and the digital copy, which theoretically would have allowed me to play the movie on my iPad and iPhone, as well as AppleTV.  Well, again, this studio has decided to make the digital copy Windows only and \\"not compatible with iTunes or Macintosh.\\"  The studios can do whatever they want, even if they want to cut out a large swath of the public for no obvious reason.  But my problem, when purchasing on Amazon, is that this is NEVER EVER clearly indicated.  Since, I've been duped before, I've learned to look for this.  But NO WHERE (and the digital copy is no longer offered) on here did it say PC only. This is the CLEAR EXCEPTION to the digital copy norm and I make it a habit to encourage studios who offer digital copies with Blu-Rays by buying them (when reasonably priced). I would not have purchased this movie had I known that.  A simple \\"PC-Only Digital Copy\\" tag would have sufficed...    What's worse, I actually have Windows 7 running in Parallels on my MacBook.  So I gave this download a try in Windows.  After being forced to install some bizarre download manager, I was shown two files downloading: PC and PSP.  To make a long and annoying story short, there only appears to be one file and it WON'T PLAY on Windows Media Player -something about an incompatible codec (ay yay yay!).  The file is only about 3MB, so I assume it's the PSP file.  The \\"PC\\" file is no where to be found and the download code no longer works.  So now, I don't even have this digital copy in PC.  All that pain for nothing (and this isn't a Mac vs. PC issue - I often use both). The only reason I give this product two stars is because it actually is a good movie.  But I didn't get the value I paid for.  Again, this is why there is piracy.  Studios are punishing people who are actually willing to pay for digital media...
0307474712|2.0|There was a lot of English slang and that threw me.  I know, that is so American of me.  But I spent a couple chapters wondering what \\"rocket\\" was and why they would want it on a pizza.  I looked it up and found out it was Arugula and STILL wonder why they would want it on a pizza.  Bottom line is, I spent all this time wondering about the English-ness because I absolutely did not care for the main characters in the book.  I can appreciate the fill in jobs and the fill in loves but I really didn't care if they ever got together.  They were both whiny and annoying and I didn't feel the chemistry at all.  And the reviews that found it \\"hillarious\\"??  I truly feel as if I read a different book. I'm sorry, I really didn't enjoy it at all.  Just my humble opinion.
B0026IQFS0|5.0|My son loved the book, 14 years old.  This is a hard age to know what boys will like to read, but he liked this book.  He also likes the Warhammer books, a little dark for me, but he enjoys them.
B003CNQPNS|5.0|For the past couple of years I have been checking Amazon (at least once a month) to see when Street Hawk was going to be released on DVD. Boy was I ever surprised to find it finally listed. Of course I bought it right away. I was 11 when the show came out and didn't remember much about it, but I remembered I liked it. My kids think (especially my 16 year old son) that I'm a big nerd. Being female doesn't help any if I was a guy I think he would understand better. OK so my phone plays Le Parc (LA Street Hawk) by Tangerine Dream. What I remember from my youth was Knight Rider, Airwolf, and Street Hawk. I loved all three of these shows and I own the ONLY three seasons of Airwolf. Season 4 to me does not count because none of the original cast is in it. I would be like if they re-casted Harry Potter right in the middle. See told you big nerd here. I did own seasons 1 and 2 of Knight Rider, but me being the pain in the butt I am sold them because the boxes weren't in the best shape. When I was watching the extras I was surprised to  hear that Rex Smith did a lot of the motorcycle driving himself. Of course the stunts were left to the professionals. I don't know if its still on there but on [...] the Street Hawk page there is an article from July 1, 2010 that says that Rex is trying to revive Street Hawk. That would be awesome! Make sure it's not on NBC though because they have proven that they can't remake a series. I'm happy to finally have Street Hawk in my TV on DVD collection!    Excuse me, pardon me, nerd coming through.

B003CNQPNS|5.0|I like Street hawk series.  Back in 1985 and 1986, I remember watching this ABC show on Friday night.  This show has action, suspense, and comedy(more on the cheesy side).  The quality of the DVD is okay of the time period( remember most TV show from the 80's were tape using poor quality film).  One thing, some(not all) of the music(popular songs from the 80's) in certain scenes have been replaced with generic music (I think, not 100% sure).  Beside that I would recommend this DVD set to anyone who is a Fan of Streethawk or if you like any of the 80's action series(A-Team, Airwolf, Knight Rider, Powers of Matt Starr, and etc).  I miss the 80's ( I HATE REALITY TV BIG TIME!!!!!!!!!).

0440243688|5.0|Jack Reacher, riding a New York subway in the early morning hours, notices a woman passenger acting strangely. Reacher watches her, ticking off the 12 points identifying her as a suicide bomber. When Reacher approaches her, she pulls a gun and kills herself. Since Reacher was the last one to speak to the woman, he's taken to the police station for questioning. When the feds show up, Reacher suspects there's more to this story than a depressed woman committing suicide. This is confirmed when he's approached by governmental and foreign organizations wanting to know what the woman passed to him before she died. Curious about what everyone is looking for, Reacher begins his own investigation which puts him at odds with law enforcement and leads him to the White House and its past connection to the Soviet war in Afghanistan during the `80s.<br /><br />Lee Child's 13th offering in the Reacher series is a tense thriller with plenty of bad guys and ample graphic violence. Reacher is a dangerous man confident in his abilities and with his own sense of justice. He isn't timid when dealing with the FBI, Homeland Security, the Department of Defense, and terrorists, all of whom are after him. His brusque, at times edifying narrative, as always, carries the plot forward in an intriguing, entertaining way, and readers will root for Reacher to take care of matters in the way only Reacher can.

1934030554|5.0|This book was just what I was looking for when I got my SRM Power Meter. If your using the WKO+ Software it covers the key areas of it. Good power based workouts are covered as well.
B0029O08WA|5.0|Loved this soundtrack.  Brought back memories of the movie.  Enjoyed all the songs.  Sometimes there might be one song that's ok, but this track they were all great!
B003VDXTWE|5.0|One of the reviews said 'I can't imagine enjoying this album in a casual or critical listening context'. Well, it fits perfectly in my listening context. I was looking for a music I can windsurf or ski with. Disco, rock, techno, classical do not work for me anymore. This album is absolute gem! The only problem is that I need 25 mi/hour wind or double diamond slope to fully enjoy most of it.
B0015DROBO|5.0|Stieg Larsson's three books were enthralling.  Revenge, murder, intrigue, compelling<br />characters, vivid descriptions.<br />Once you are done reading his third book, The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest, you will wish the author<br />had written more in his short life.<br />Good luck when you finish all three books, you will<br />want to start over with the first one again, because it will be very hard to find current fiction that even steps up<br />to his intricate, thoroughly researched and plotted stories.
B001FB5634|5.0|_The Road_ (2009) is an excellent film based on a novel by Cormac McCarthy.  The film focuses on the relationship between a father and his son as they attempt to survive a post-apocalyptic world.  The father and son travel along a dangerous path and meet the few survivors on their way.  Gangs of cannibals chase them along the way and manage to capture some of the few other survivors.  We learn that following the apocalypse the boy's mother has committed suicide by walking alone into the woods.  The surroundings are bleak and desolate and few people remain along the way.  Eventually the boy and his father meet up with an old man who has gone blind.  The boy begs his father to help him so they give the old man some food.  They continue along their way and manage to find an old farmhouse where they stay for the night.  Eventually they make it to a beach where they meet another man who the boy begs his father to help.  However, the father decides to leave him alone.  Along the way the father is injured and is slowly dying.  The father tells his son that he carries the \\"fire inside\\" and that his son must go on without him.  The son cares for his father throughout the night as he slowly passes.  When the father dies this leaves the son all alone to survive in the world.  However, at the end he discovers another family that he can join and the father of the family tells him that he too \\"carries the fire inside\\".    I felt his film was very good in its featuring the relationship between father and son.  The scenery is bleak and desolate but well put together.  The movie has a positive ending despite the fact that at the end the boy will remain separated from his father.  Overall, I felt this film was excellent.
0060989157|4.0|Fun read if you are a guy.  I can't imagine many girls liking this book but I'm sure some are out there.  Pretty much exactly what you would expect from a rock band.  Not the most intelligent writing in the world but if you are reading this then you aren't looking for that.  Read it over a 3 day weekend at the beach.
B002ZG997C|4.0|_The Book of Eli_ (2010)starring Denzil Washington as the prophet Eli features a world destroyed by war brought on by religion and hate.  Few humans remain left and water has become a scarce commodity.  Many of the humans have resorted to cannibalism and those who attack the wandering Eli are quickly despatched with his savage blade.  Eli enters a town where he is able to teach a young girl about his religious belief and to pray to God.  However, the leader of the town seeks to impose his will upon the people and has been searching for a copy of the Bible so he may use it towards his evil ends (he also seems to enjoy biographies of Mussolini).  Only one copy of the Bible remains in existence and that is the property of Eli who maintains that he must \\"head West\\" under the guidance of a voice he has heard \\"from within himself\\" so that he may find an appropriate place for the Bible.  A series of massive gun fights ensue and a couple George and Martha (Washington?) are brought into the matter which occurs in an epic showdown between Eli, the girl, George and Martha, and the rest of the gang looking for the Book outside of a white house.  Eli is wounded but the girl manages to escape; however, the leader has managed to attain the Book despite the fact that he has been injured.  Eli manages to head further West with the girl where he encounters a second remaining society.  This society has a library set up and seeks to spread all human knowledge to the world again through its printing press.  The library contains much of Western culture including books by Shakespeare and the music of Wagner as well as Britannica encyclopedias.  Eli tells the girl that he contains the Bible in his heart and begins dictating the entire Bible to an old wisened librarian who eventually is to complete the entire dictation thus preserving forever knowledge of the Bible (which will be set to the printing press).  In the meantime, after trying to pick the lock on his own Bible the leader of the town discovers that the Bible is written in Braile.  He attempts to have his blind mistress read it for him but she refuses.  Eventually the illiterate men of his town are to revolt against their master.  In the meantime, Eli slowly dies of the wound inflicted upon him but not before completing the entire Bible.  In this manner, the Bible and teachings of Christ will be passed on to a future post-apocalyptic generation.  Earlier in the film Eli had noted that in the war of the past books were burned and destroyed with the exception of the Bible.  I feel that this may be a reference to the internet in which books are pillaged and information is ripe for rampant abuse.  At the end of the film, the girl manages to set out back for home carrying her mission from Eli to return home.  I felt this film was spiritually fulfilling a vacuous post-apocalyptic world.  Eli notes that in the world before the apocalypse people had much but did not appreciate what they had.  His personal faith is quite touching in light of the hostility to such faith in the modern world.  The end of the movie explains the importance of cultural and religious preservationism and through the medium of the printing press the Bible and the Gospel of Christ will continue to live on a for a future generation of people.    My main criticism of the film is the excessive violence that Eli delivers in brutally killing animals for food and his opponents in battle.  Eli spares none and carries a sharp blade which he uses to torture and kill all his opponents.  I felt that this was somewhat unbecoming in a film about spiritual truth that emphasizes the golden rule.  The harshness and violence of the film detract from the overall message I felt and for this reason I only gave the film 4 stars.

B003J27WFW|5.0|Great video! A nice behind the scenes look throughout Rush's career from the early beginnings to today. Answered a few questions I always had such as \\"Why did John Rutsey leave the band?\\", etc...A lot of great looking footage and some interesting, older footage. Includes a bonus disc with extra film and concert footage. A highly recommended video for any Rush fan.

B001GCUO5M|1.0|I am a huge fan of Leonardo Dicaprio.  He has such a great talent for so many characters.  Unfortunately, for him, this is not one of his best parts.  Oh, he was, as usual, interesting, however the story line was far less clever.  Was anyone really not sure, after several of his flash backs, just how the story was going to play out??  It started out promising, but soon fell to mediocre  after the first 35 min or so.  I kept watching because I already bought the movie, and because the shinning reviews promised there would be something redeeming in the story line.  It was not to be.  If you just like to look at Leonardo and don't care about the story, then by all means get the movie.  But if your looking for a thriller, or some real substance or thought, forget it, you aren't going to find it here.  Hopefully, he will be able to find a worthy script sometime soon.  He has made some great films.
B00003CXB4|5.0|I bought this movie for my 8 month old daughter...and she loves it. I notice my child loves looking at movies with music.  And the Lion King is one of her favorite.  It keeps her attention from the time it comes on to the end or she falls asleep first.<br />It's really a good movie.
B00368PSN2|4.0|I got this movie mainly because of Jim Caviezel and it was really good. I don't know why this movie wasn't given wider screenings because it has a good cast, the story is good and the acting was, on the whole, excellent.

THIS ONE IS A CLASSIC.
0143118420|2.0|I read the book in wake of publicity surrounding the movie version, and I hope Julia Roberts can at least make this viable entertainment.<br /><br />The longer the book went into ms. Gilbert's self exploration, the more self congratulatory and obtuse the account became.  I don't know that I was expecting anything, but I don't think (spoilers) I envisioned that this woman who felt tied down would end her journey of self-discovery being tied down, just over three continents instead of simply within NYC and its environs.<br /><br />Autobiographies are by their nature a little too in love with their subject...that is to be expected. But it was strange to me that after a year abroad she had simply exchanged the drama of her old life for the undiscovered drama of her new life.  It seems odd that her new life does not sound that much different from her old life-except she's got a new man.<br /><br />I was taken by the final protion where she evaluates all that has passed in her life, and simply accepts them as being what they are and that she was no longer burdened by them-which sounds exactly like what my friends who have taken EST (in the old days), the Landmark Forum, or any number of self awareness adventures say-and is an experience that can be had without traveling across the world.<br /><br />Kudos to Ms. Gilbert for finding herself-but I have to wave off anyone who reads this book with an expectation of anything but a narcisisstic expose of a privileged person exchanging one privileged life for another.

B000UVK84W|5.0|My brothers and I grew up watching the films that Ray Harryhausen did the special effects on, and The Golden Voyage of Sinbad is one of his works that we admired.<br /><br />The one thing that I love about this movie is how it is shot on location.  The scenery is beautiful, and Sinbad is as swashbuckling as can be!  I enjoy the mystical creatures and magic that is a part of the story.  Seeing this movie again was like taking a voyage back to my childhood! It's a story of wonderment and mystique that can be enjoyed by all ages.
B00005JLF5|3.0|I was disappointed in the condition of the packaging for this item.  The hard plastics of the package arrived with several broken parts to it.  These are the pieces that hold the DVDs in place.  The plastic covering for the DVD box is also taring at the seams.  Fortunately the DVDs play just fine, but I can tell that the item wasn't stored properly.  Probably in some hot warehouse where the packaging just dried out.  I will likely purhcase a DVD case for the DVDs to prevent them from jumbling around and scratching.
B001PA0FFO|1.0|Count me among the minority of reviewers who doubt that this movie has any real merit.  As they've noted, this movie only pretends to wrestle with uncertainty and doubt of a profound form.  Anyone who entertains no doubts with regard to the big questions has fallen under the spell of an ideology; if you need this movie to be awakened to doubt, you've probably been in the grip of such a spell.<br /><br />The main doubt portrayed by the movie is actually a superficial one resulting from witholding information which would provide closure and meaning to the rather simple plot.  The truncated ending (or rather lack of a real ending) is such a fatal flaw that any redeeming qualities this movie has (and there are many) are totally undermined, to the extent that my rating is pushed all the way down to the extreme of 1 star, which is a rarity for me (I tend to be generous with movie ratings).<br /><br />I have no doubt that the 100+ minutes I spent watching this movie were wasted.

B003ITZBVI|5.0|DC has produced a comparatively (to Marvel) prolific line of straight to DVD animated features in the last few years, and this latest release is the best since Justice League Unlimited.  The script delivers everything a fan wants, delving deep into the Batman mythology and taking advantage of Batman's rogues gallery, especially the Joker who is as brutal and deadly as any we've ever seen him (NOTE to parents, most of the worst violence happens off screen, but it may still be upsetting).  The animation is beautiful,the action genuinely thrilling, and the script smart and well acted.  The story has surprising psychological depth, but still delivers as a straight forward adventure for The World's Greatest Detective.  This is a keeper.
B0006OBPTA|5.0|These movies are great, and everyone needs to own them!! They teach good lessons in life.
0307474712|3.0|I had high hopes for this book. I had read a review in a magazine that gave the book 4 stars and raved about what a good book it was, that it was a clever love story and that it was really funny. Well i agree that its a cool concept but as far as a love story and being really funny i have to highly disagree. It never came off funny what so ever. For me the book rambled on and on. Also the characters are english and there are several reference that im clueless about, along with some english terms that i dont know the meanings of which made it a little annoying to not understand what im reading. Overall id say the book was \\"eh\\".
B002ZG980U|5.0|Inception was a great movie. It has been over two weeks since the movie was released and it is still going strong. The movie theater was packed to the point where people was sitting in the front row, that right there should tell you something most people myself included hate sitting there.   The story line was more original then anything I have seen in a long time. Leonardo's character is tormented my the lost of his beloved wife. To the point where he is seeing her everywhere and this is affecting his work which is getting into peoples dreams and stealing their secrets. He has to face his demons and figure out what is reality and what isn't in order to get back to his awaiting children.   The movie was visually exciting I felt during parts of the movie I was in it. I would recommend Inception to anyone.

0515125024|3.0|I read Lee's first Reacher book, \\"The Killing Floor,\\" and really enjoyed it. This book disappointed me a bit, though the actual plot was interesting (I have never read a story about crazy militia starting their own country, blah blah blah). The problem with this book is Lee includes far too many wordy details and descriptions. Some people will love that, I did not. When someone pulls a gun on the lead character, I want to know what happens - how does he get out of it? I don't care that a gun was pulled on \\"so and so\\" and then go through several paragraphs about the type of gun and how it fires and any other technical details. I want to know how the character gets out of the situation. Another point is in a different scene, when someone fires a bullet, I don't need a mili-second play-by-play description of how the bullet is flying through the air and how it reacts to gravity and other aerodynamics. I just want to know if it hit the target or not. Maybe I had ADD, but I though the overuse of descriptions was distracting, and at times, forced me to skip some paragraphs. Towards the end, I was tempted to skim, but I didn't allow myself to do that. The overall plot was interesting enough, making it easier to bypass some minor plot holes (there has to be some suspension of disbelief with Lee's Reacher character). If you don't mind over descriptive details, you may like this book. The use of such details I'm sure will be interesting to some and actually isn't bad information -- just not in thrillers that I like to read.
0143038419|1.0|A story of a woman who abandons her family.  I can just imagine the outcry from feminists if a film were made about a man you decided to leave his family in search of personal fulfillment (lets just say sex!) abroad!  Her (ex) husband should be glad to get rid of her useless ass!
B000N6TX1I|1.0|This movie is boring, pointless, awful, ugly. Stupid story and stupid film.  So the little black girl gets pregnant to carry on the human race? Is that supposed to be ironic?   And why did other girls not get pregnant? They used birth control and she didn't?      How lucky for her to become another Eve!     \\"The Handmaid's Tale\\" by M. Atwood deals with a similar premise but is a great novel and was made into a great film.    The book by P.D. James is crap and so is the movie.
B0012GVKW8|5.0|I was very pleased with the picture quality of the movie.  Obviously there was no HD equipment in 1987 when the movie was filmed, but this Blu-ray looks very good.  One of Arnold's best, for sure.
0385732554|3.0|Rather unremarkable dystopian fiction, only this time geared for young adults.  It's a serviceable book for middle schoolers to read, if for no other reason the books from which it is derived (1984, We, Brave New World, etc.) are at a much higher reading level.<br /><br />Although it's readable (and engaging, as soon as you get to the \\"You may lie\\" line), the thing that prevents it from being any greater is that the core metaphor, the core premise of the book, is wobbly.  It'd be one thing if the Giver had been teaching him about the lost art of reading.  But that's been done, in \\"Fahrenheit 451.\\"  Or maybe teaching him about the lost art of science?  But that's been done, in \\"Anthem.\\"  Or teaching him about history?  Only that's been done too:  in \\"1984.\\"<br /><br />So what remains for Lowry?  To teach him to reconnect with memories.  Which can be transfered, though when they are they cannot be retained?  What?  And the way to transfer them is to put your hands on the recipient's back?  What?<br /><br />This whole operation suffered from a sort of clunky awkwardness that prevented me from engaging with the novel any more deeply.  That and the unclear, unsatisfying ending.
B00000J7JO|5.0|8 long years had passed since the Red Hot Chili Peppers released their seminal album Blood Sugar Sex Magick, and in this turbulent time period the Red Hot Chili Peppers experienced plenty of upheaval including numerous lineup changes, after guitarist John Frusciante abruptly left the band and rode the downward spiral of heroin addiction, as well as the drug problems of lead singer Anthony Kiedis.  The band's outlook improved when John Frusciante decided to rejoin the band, finally beating the addiction that robbed him of a once-promising career.    The result of their work is one of the finest albums of the 90's, a critical and commercial smash. The opener \\"Around the World\\" hits hard and mixes a funky bass line with Anthony's rap/sing style. Anthony's voice sounds world's better than on previous albums, and his range is impressive, as he sings his way through a majority of the album. Songs like \\"Otherside\\" simply would not have been possible earlier in his singing career.     The album reaches its zenith with the title track \\"Californication,\\" which deals with California's influence on the rest of the world, a song that may be one of the finest in the storied career of the band. John really stands out on this song with a great solo that makes the listener glad that he cleaned up and rejoined the band. \\"Scar Tissue\\" rides one of the most recognizable guitar riffs and shows why Frusciante is one of the top rock guitarists working today.    The band reminds you of where they came from with funky tracks like \\"Get on Top,\\"  \\"I Like Dirt\\" and \\"Purple Stain\\" that showcases Flea's bass and wouldn't be out of place on Mother's Milk or Blood Sugar Sex Magick.     In short there's really something for everyone, both old school fans and casual listeners will fall in love with the reborn Red Hot Chili Peppers, and this album really marked a turning point with the band mostly abandoning the funk/rap style for a more mature, world weary sound that would dominate on later albums.
B000GFLAI0|5.0|That's the great thing about Dylan. Sometimes, at first listen, some of his albums are difficult to \\"get\\". This is one of those. A lot of the songs are catchy but to a youthful modern ear they don't go anywhere, no huge solo, no self rightoeus pointmaking, just Dylan at his \\"desolation row\\" finest. One slow, rambling storytelling song followed by the same. Great if you're into that.... and I am.
1405853115|5.0|It's funny because I bought this book in Russia for about 600 roubles, which is roughly 20$.    This book is great, but the dvd in my book is covered with scratches.
B00009MGGI|5.0|This DVD was so compelling that I don't know how anyone could watch one episode without continuing on! Wonderful acting.
0439023491|4.0|It would be easy to dismiss \\"Catching Fire\\" as a perfunctory bridge between \\"The Hunger Games\\" and \\"Mockingjay\\" and, in a sense, it is necessarily that.  i was at first put off by the plot device that pushed the characters and readers into a second Games, and more or less knew from the outset where this second part of the trilogy would end.  Inevitably, \\"Catching Fire\\" is a set-up device for Mockingjay; it is, however, considerably more than that.  Collins uses this book to paint an emerging polarity between Katniss and Peeta -- she becoming hardened (and nearly unlikable); he becoming ever more valorous and human.  This rich subtext of character development surmounts the plot's predictability and makes \\"Catching Fire\\" a worthy prelude to the trilogy's crescendo.
B0029LX2LC|4.0|Great album. Content is very current to our times. Not the average shallow Hip Hop album. The Roots put alot of work into this release.
030745455X|5.0|My review title says it all.  I shook my fist and grinned from ear to ear at the very end -- YES!  Can't wait to start Hornets Nest!!!  Lisbeth Salandar is my kind of protagonist.  Her story is heartbreaking and yet inspiring.  You can't help but want things to work out for her.  I enjoyed the relationship between her and Blomkvist in the first book but found myself a little disgusted with all his bedhopping.  In this book he has seemingly grown up a little.  Now he knows her history and the pain she's been through.  Who knows what lies ahead for these two?!?!?  Great story and a really fun read.  YES!!!

B00127RAJY|4.0|Last year I started doing this workout 1-2 times a day in the spring. By the fall, all the fat around my stomach area was almost completely gone. This is a great workout.My pants were practically falling off of me. If you stick to this and eat right, you will tone up and get fit.   My only complaint about this workout is the stupid commercials in the beginning. I have to wait around 5 minutes before I can start the workout every time because it wont let me fast forward through it. Comon already! Stop wasting time! Im ready to EXERCISE!
B00049QQHI|4.0|As a huge fan of Leonardo DiCaprio, I was excited to watch this movie for the first time. Not surprisingly, I enjoyed it immensely. The Basketball Diaries is a raw, harrowing account of young man's descent into heroin addiction. It's dark, disturbing, and painfully hard to stomach at times. It's another brilliant example that Leonardo DiCaprio can play so many more roles that sweet, love-struck boy from Titanic.     For the first thirty minutes, I had trouble understanding where this movie was headed. A bunch of Catholic school teenagers stalk the streets of Manhattan, creating small mischief. They appear harmless, headed in the direction of numerous basketball scholarships. Leonardo DiCaprio's character, Jim, writes stunningly beautiful poetry. However, things eventually go downhill. Through a series of events I won't spoil, Jim and his friends begin experimenting with drugs.    Everything changes. This seemingly light tale commences into a constant battle for another taste. It's hard to watch characters fall so hard. The Basketball Diaries turns into an unbelievably bleak story of what these chemicals can really do to somebody. The withdrawal scenes in this movie are some of the best I've ever watched. I was cringing for minutes at a time. I found this movie incredibly moving and engaging. However, the ending seemed a little rushed. The transition from drug user to clean, completely changed individual didn't come off realistically enough to me. Leonardo DiCaprio's character was so obsessed with the needle I had trouble believing his somewhat quick recovery. That being said, the rest of this movie makes up for it.    As a side note, I also thought Mark Wahlberg did a great job with his smaller part. He's a great actor, and always entertaining to watch.    Check it out!
B003J27WFW|5.0|This is a must have for Rush fans. Great info and a great story. One of the best documentaries I've ever seen!
0393334988|5.0|In February 1942, the city of Singapore, defended by 80,000 British and Commonwealth troops, surrenders to the Japanese. The loss of Singapore, coupled with the preceding loss of the British warships Repulse and Prince of Wales, is described by Churchill as the darkest British moments of the Second World War, whilst the capitulation of Singapore becomes the British Army's greatest defeat.    Amongst the tens of thousands of British soldiers rounded up and taken into captivity is Lt. Eric Lomax, a Royal Signals officer. Initially, the vast mass of British POWs hugely outnumbers their Japanese captors, leading to a relaxed atmosphere where the British prisoners mostly police themselves. Overconfident, many of the British prisoners began building home-made radios to keep a closer eye on the course of the war. However, as time passes the POWs begin to be dispersed, many being sent to be worked to death on the River Kwae railway as it slowly makes its way across Thailand and into Burma. In these smaller camps, much more aggressively policed by Japanese guards, the prisoners find their confidence and expectation of good treatment rapidly disabused. Lomax's involvement in the construction of clandestine radios leads him to being imprisoned, humiliated, tortured and condemned to a number of horrific prisons in and around Bangkok.    Eventually the war ends and Lomax returns home, but finds that his torture continues. His experiences lead to the breakdown of his first marriage, an estrangement from his father and decades of nightmares and broken sleep patterns. Only in the early 1990s does Lomax finally receive the counselling and psychiatric help he has needed, a process which eventually leads him back to Thailand and a meeting with one of his Japanese tormentors, an interpreter who rejected his nation's barbarous methods of torture and militarism and has spent the decades since working to ensure that the Japanese do not forget what they did in the war. In this meeting Lomax eventually finds a kind of peace, fifty years after the war ends.    The Railway Man is a memoir of one man's experiences in the Second World War. It opens with a summary of Lomax's childhood and background, his experiences as a railway and engineering enthusiast, his decision to enlist before WWII even starts and his eventual involvement in the debacle of Singapore's fall (the city's monstrous defences were oriented seaward, allowing the Japanese to simply walk in from the rear and take it almost completely unopposed). This is followed by the largest part of the book, as Lomax recalls his experiences in various POW camps and later prisons, in which he recounts his treatment at the hands of the Japanese. These sections are definitely not for those with weak stomachs. The cruelty of the Japanese to those who surrendered to them is well-documented, but even so the sheer, inhuman horror they inflicted on Lomax is shocking. However, even more startling is the lack of counselling or treatment Lomax received upon his eventual release, and the mild mistreatment inflicted on the former POWs by their liberators (such as former POWs, in many cases malnourished and weakened by four years of captivity, being expected to do the work of fully-healthy, fresh recruits on the return voyage to Britain).    The book ends with Lomax's experiences as a much older man, meeting one of his former tormentors face-to-face in Thailand, revisiting his old prison camp and then visiting Japan. This section of the book is the most powerful, as Lomax's utter hatred and loathing of the Japanese comes through the text vividly. He has no interest in forgiveness or reconciliation until he meets his former adversary and discovers the extreme lengths he has gone to to make amends for his actions in the war, including directly challenging Japan's culture of denial and disinterest in the war crimes committed by its soldiers during the war.    The Railway Man is one of the most powerful experiences of life in wartime I have ever read. Lomax illuminates the so-called 'forgotten war' by showing the rank foolishness that led to Singapore's capture, the overconfidence of the British POWs whose initial freedoms led them into a false sense of security, and the horrors of torture, in which no punches are pulled. Lomax describes his own mistreatment in a somewhat dispassionate tone for the most part, but occasionally his fury and anger at his mistreatment comes through, undimmed by fifty years of peace (the book was originally published in 1995). Lomax refuses to consider himself a hero, citing many of his fellow soldiers whose feats were more impressive (such as the Scottish officer who grabbed a rifle off a startled Japanese guard to put a bullet through one of his own men dying from cholera after the Japanese proved unable to shoot him accurately), but, as with many old soldiers, Lomax dismisses his own achievements too easily. Lomax refuses to give out any names or compromise the network that led to the construction of the radios, despite being put through treatments almost too horrendous to contemplate (including the Japanese practice of repeated waterboarding), saving the lives of his colleagues. The final section, dealing with the reconciliation, is quietly hopeful, with the reader left hoping that the author has indeed exorcised his demons through the process of the meeting and the writing of this book.    The Railway Man (*****) is a remarkable story, powerful, moving and intense, and again confirming that people can endure incredible hardships under extraordinary circumstances when the need is greatest. It is a book that everyone with an interest in the Second World War should read. It is available now in the UK and USA.  Bookmark and Share

Each character has more depth and personality in a cartoon than they do in the live action films. The animation is spectacular and so is the voice acting. The fights are superb... a lot of thought has gone into how someone like batman might actually have to do some of what he does.

B003L20ICE|2.0|I guess the problem I had with The Kids Are All Right was lack of focus and character development (although the performances were top notch!). It starts off being about the kids and their need to know who their biological father is, and then it turns into a \\"soap opera-like\\" affair between the donor and one of the lesbian moms. Frankly, I found the squabbling between the lesbians to be a tired, cliche-driven, melodramatic plotline. What was the point of it all? That a member of a gay marriage can feel just as under-appreciated as a member of a straight marriage? Wow. I paid 10 bucks to find that out. Really big deal. I was much more interested to discover more about the kids. (After all that was the title of the film.) I wanted to see more interaction between them and their biological dad. I wanted to find out how their biological dad affected their lives--especially the boy who lacked a father figure and was the one who initially wanted to find out who the donor was. You can tell this boy, Laser, lacked self-confidence. He let his \\"best friend\\" Clay bully him around. You can also tell that the biological dad, Paul, was probably bullied around too when he was Laser's age. That could've been the reason why he didn't like team sports. Laser and Paul could've had a much more meaningful connection in the story. But instead we were stuck with this lesbian soap opera jamboree. It didn't seem like the writer knew what she wanted to do with this story. It was going off in too many directions and subsequently lost its focus. So the kids lost respect for their biological dad because he had an affair with one of their moms. That was the whole point of having the kids in the story??? I give it a C.
1401227821|5.0|I've been following the art of Adam Hughes since I was a child. He has evolved from a competent pencil artist to a superb illustrator. The book covers this journey and it is nice to see his development. There are many sketches to complement each cover and lots of commentaries by the author.  The only thing I miss are the works he's done for other companies, but as long as DC is the publisher that was impossible. Let's hope someone collects those works in another book.  If you are a fan of Adam Hughes' work, don't think it twice: this is your book.

0316017922|5.0|Gladwell's book is well written documenting a number of successful people and tracing the roots of their success.  It also tracks a number of well educated and very smart people who aren't particularly successful and explains why.  In either case, we owe much more to hard work, luck and/or extraordinary set of circumstances that lead to success -- those are the true sources of success rather than individual ingenuity.  For as Gladwell documents so well, there were many generations of very ingenuous people who did not succeed due to unlucky and unfortunate circumstances, say folks born after 1900 that experienced two world wars and a great depression.      While this perhaps isn't new to some, Gladwell does a great job articulating his thesis.  This is something I've felt but would not have been able to articulate it nowhere near as clearly and as well as Gladwell.  On the contrary, when I first came to America in the early 90's I was overwhelmed by a number of people telling me how this or that person rose to riches \\"all on his own.\\"  It never rang true to me and Gladwell's book does a great job debunking that myth.  This is a book well worth reading.

A fine nose, slightly shiny with grease, and dark skin beneath the eyes that looked almost bruised, a badge of honour from all the smoking and late nights spent deliberately losing at strip poker.\\"<br /><br />Emma Morley, a beauty when you wipe away the dull veneer and really look in closely, smart, needs a jab of ambition, definitely not promiscuous - which is not to say she is by any means prudish.<br /><br />\\"She was pretty but seemed annoyed by the fact. Her bottled-red hair was almost willfully badly cut, alone in front of the mirror probably. Her skin had a pallid puffiness that spoke of too much time in libraries . . . there was no denying that her face - well, her face was a wonder.\\"<br /><br />Someone should -- and surely will -- make a movie about their relationship. It will pull in buckets of money. It will reduce audiences to tears.<br /><br />St. Swithin's Day is celebrated in the U.K. on July 15. We meet Emma and Dex on St. Swithin's Day in 1988 when they spend the day (and night) together, in Edinburgh, the last of their days as students. Over the next two decades, we catch up and check in with them every year on the same date, July 15, and watch as their lives unfold and their friendship grows and a relationship, mostly platonic, develops based on need and trust and the emotional sustenance they gain from each other.<br /><br />Post-university, Emma ends up \\"in the graveyard of ambition\\" working as a waitress at \\"Loco Caliente,\\" a Tex-Mex restaurant in north London. One of the great set pieces has Emma giving the new guy on the wait staff, Ian Whitehead, a tour of the dive. \\"Loco Caliente means `Crazy Hot.' Hot because the air-conditioning doesn't work, `crazy' because that's what you'd have to be to eat here. Or work here, come to that. Mucho mucho loco.\\"<br /><br />Dexter, meanwhile, learns to define hedonism and falls into the job of a TV \\"presenter\\" on \\"Late-Night Lock-In,\\" a past-midnight program targeting his age group and lifestyle. Dexter attracts success much like he does women. He enjoys both. Humility is an attribute for others. \\"Dexter didn't like to think of himself as vain, but there were definitely times when he wished there was someone on hand to take his photogaph.\\"<br /><br />Dexter's success is dazzling. His fall from grace and teen favor is equally steep. Booze, drugs and bad behavior account for the decline. We get to see him, as Emma does, at his absolute worst. Being out of fahion is not something Dexter wears well.  Emma remains a steadfast friend, for the most part. Their relationship snags bottom in 1995 when Emma gives Dexter what she believes and fears is a final buss on the cheek, \\"Dexter, I love you so much. So, so much, and I probably always will. I just don't like you anymore. I'm sorry.\\"<br /><br />With time and circumstance, it's fair to say, the relationship bounds back, evolves. If this all sounds as if the book might veer in the direction of becoming this generation's \\"Love Story,\\" forget it. \\"One Day\\" is a love story, but a story of two people without all the pathos of Erich Segal's 1970 bestseller.

B003NTSBUG|5.0|At first I was a little thrown off about casting Leonardo DiCaprio in a suspense/ thriller, but this being a Scorsese movie I had to watch it. Watching this movie has left me not only scarred by the realization of the climax, and ending, but HIGHLY impressed at how Leonardo has matured in his acting. Scorsese has AGAIN created a masterpiece that will not only leave you breathless, emotionally scarred, amazed, and distrought by the plight of every aspect of the protagonists life.(partial spoiler!!!!) It does leave you to think... Is it better to live as a monster, or die as a good man?

1591843162|5.0|Warning: If you absorb all business blogger Seth Godin's advice, you could end up overworked and underappreciated. Godin's antidote to mediocrity and conformity is so effective and convincing that it may have the unintended consequence of making you the go-to person for your whole organization. Godin stipulates that everyone faces a choice: An individual can choose to live day after day, year after year, languidly going through the motions, doing work that is devoid of excitement and imagination. Or, he or she can choose a path that promotes uniqueness and ingenuity by becoming a \\"linchpin,\\" an invaluable, indispensable employee, the center of all a company's activities. Godin declares that if you believe in yourself and your potential for greatness, kindle the creative spark within, embrace risk and seek the good in others, you can become an influential linchpin. Although Godin writes in his signature rambling style, which some readers may find distracting, getAbstract applauds this unique, absorbing business book, whose reach extends far beyond the conference room. The author has done his part; your path is up to you. Proceed with caution - even being a linchpin has its hazards.
B00003CWN3|5.0|Hilary Swank is great in her role, but it's Chloe Sevigny that makes the movie. The plot is solid and the emotion really builds as the movie goes on. One of my favorite films.
030726999X|3.0|Having greatly enjoyed the first two thirds of this series, I was eagerly looking forward to the last, particularly because the ending of The Girl Who Played with Fire was such a cliff hanger. Hornet's Nest opens where Fire left off, at the crime scene where Blomvist finds Salander in such trouble. Those troubles persist, big time, throughout this final installment, and it is up to Blomvist to unravel a conspiracy of mind-boggling proportions.<br /><br />Regrettably, the plot thickens, and not in a positive way. The action grinds to a halt, and more than five hundred pages descend into an endless series of meetings, discussions, hypothesizing, and talk, talk, talk. True, the conspiracy is a complex one, but some judicious editing might have cut some of the less interesting passages, such as those lengthy ones explaining the constitutional status of the government of Sweden.<br /><br />When the trial, which is the centerpiece of the plot, finally commences, Larsson's usual taut pacing returns. The last quarter of Hornet's Nest is suspenseful, but ultimately satisfying. It would certainly be possible for  Larsson  to have continued with this series, but since he cannot, it's gratifying for readers to be able to let Blomvist and Salander go with a sense of equanimity.<br /><br />Readers of Tattoo and Fire are encouraged to read Hornet's Nest, where the real backstory concerning Salander becomes clear. Reading this entry as a stand alone, however, would probably be disappointing.

0226264211|5.0|Although this text is over forty years old, the principals are just as true today.  Milton Friendman seems amazingly prophetic, and that is one of the most entertaining qualities of this book - to look at the text now and see how most of the examples of government intervention have developed just as he theorized.  Not only has the result of government intervention turned out much as he proposed, but the reaction of government has followed his predictions almost exactly.  This book will be an eye opening jump start for anyone who believes FDR's policies were beneficial, that the federal reserve has done it's job, or even that professional licensure by the state is a beneficial protection of consumers.

From the beginning the whole thing is so blurry and made worse by not showing it in the wide screen format as it was filmed but on a bad full screen version.    Even the print on the dvd case is hard to read I tried using a magnifying glass to no avail.

I don't know why there are not a lot more of the series made available.    My favorite episode on this DVD is \\"Gun Shy\\" it is a parody of the wildly popular Gun Smoke that was just starting out at the time. The more you know about Gun Smoke the more hysterical this episode is.    I'd buy more of the series if they were available.    Definitely 2 thumbs up!

B001NLKT60|5.0|After Lisabeth dumps Elvis at the end of the Girl With the Dragon Tattoo she spends a year or so traveling around the world. Shortly after she returns to Sweden she becomes the primary suspect in a triple murder.  The police are looking for her, Blomvist is looking for her, her old boss is looking for her, a murderous motorcycle gang is looking for her. Every thing known about her life is plastered in the papers, and exaggerated in the tabloids, she and all her known friends are laid bare and twisted into santanic worshiping dykes for the public to consume while drinking their morning coffee.<br /><br />Blomvist is friends of two of the victims who were journalist writing an in depth expose on the sex trafficking business in Sweden. They were trying to track down the elusive references to Zala. The very mention of him causes hardened men to shake. His secrets seem to lie hidden within the police files.<br /><br />Lisbeth is avoiding Blomvist and she is also looking for the evil Zala for reasons of her own. During her search she is kicking but and taking names (for future retribution I hope).<br /><br />I read this book on a Sunday, I literally could not put it down. It is very very suspenseful. If you enjoyed the Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, you will love The Girl Who Played with Fire. Tonight I start the Girl Who Kicked the Hornets' Nest.
B0038VPB5W|5.0|I've always hated BfMV because of their immature and common style, but Fever blew me away because they finally grew up and matured. Their sound is more melodic, heavier, deeper, and just overall more mature. Every song on this album is unique and packs a punch and really hits you. Song like Your Betrayal, Dignity, and The Last Fight really scream diversity. The guitar riffs are very melodic and technical, as well as heavy, and Matt's singing is a lot tighter, and more professional sounding. If you hated BfMV before this album will change your opinion on them.
B0015DROBO|4.0|When I first mentioned to a few friends I was reading The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo they all commented about all the violence toward women in the book (these were friends who have not acutally read the book). I read the book anyway and found no more violence in the book than in an evening of primetime American tv viewing. And anyway what do you expect from a book that was originally published under the title Men Who Hate Women?<br /><br />The first 50 or so pages were extremely boring to me and I wondered how the book had ever gotten published. I stuck with it and then things began to pick up and I had to force my self to put it down to sleep, eat and other things.<br /><br />Lisbeth, the girl with the dragon tatoo, appears to be the perfect victim, small skinny and apparently with no resources. Appearances can be deceiving and in her case they are...very deceiving. She has a strong spirit and has survived many many devestating events in her life. Many times she has been victimized but never a victim, if you hurt her she can and will hurt you more.<br /><br />Blomvist is a journalist in disgrace hired to solve a mystery that has gone unsolved for more than 2 decades. He and Lisbeth unite when she is hired as a research assistant. Together they solve the mystery, face a family that has more than its fair share of whackos, nut cases, and murderers.<br /><br />Don't let negative comments or reviews, the first boring 50 pages or anything else stop you from reading this book. I enjoyed it and believe anyone who likes a good who dunnit will enjoy it too.<br /><br />As soon as I finished this book I bought the next one in the series.
B003L20IHE|5.0|Having gone to see this movie last night, I went home and ordered the book, and signed up to be notified when the movie becomes available on Amazon. Going in to see the movie, I had looked up the details on the plot. It looked like a good movie. I was not disappointed. The main characters were great, Charlie, his brother Sam, the woman who comes into his life, all were great. After Sam dies, Charlie stops going forward with his life. He can see Sam in spirit, and spends every afternoon playing ball with him. After 5 years, a woman comes into his life and shakes up his world. He is torn between hanging onto the past,time with Sam, and getting into a relationship with her. There is a boat accident, and much more. Towards the end of the movie, it can tug on the heartstrings. The ending is great. If someone is hanging onto the past that need to be let go, this would be a movie to help it happen.  Well worth going to see, and buy for the home collection.
9889979942|4.0|I have been contemplating travelling to China for a month or to now. I saw this book and thought it would be worth a look as I am more interested in the people I meet and the places they are from than anything else!  The book is fairly hefty as you'd expect, China is huge. Tom highlights each individul place he visits, uses his own photos to illustrate each place and also adds a brief description of what he encountered. It was perfect for me and I just needed to be teased in this way before heading out to see the magical place he's presents so well. Basically the book is Tom's views on what he saw at the time. Also some travelling tales that sound amazing.  It all made for an easy and interesting read. Tom appears to be  good 'tourist' he shows up, walks the unbeaten track, takes photos and embraces everything he can, his book is a part of him and hundreds of others he has met on his travels.  So far I haven't encountered anything negative or opinionated. It's a beautifully illustrated glimpse of China and it's people.    A book I will show to anyone thinking of venturing to China. Also to my chinese friends in the UK. To see what they think.    Thanks Tom, for the inspiration.  Keep walking on ....
B003KUSUG8|5.0|Eminem is brilliant. This is a fantastic album, definatly not for children. He is a genius.
0307269752|1.0|First, full disclosure: I only managed to read about 150 pages of this book before I gave up in disgust.<br /><br />That said: what a freaking disaster. I knew going in that this novel was only published in the United States because it was an international bestseller, but that didn't prepare me for how awful the book actually was.<br /><br />Let me start with the writing. Not the nitty-gritty word choice and sentence structure of the writing; those issues could possibly be the fault of the translation. Translation can't possibly be to blame for the relentless telling instead of showing, however, or the way that the story interrupts itself every three pages to include a paragraph or ten of backstory for Every. Single. Minor. Character. Or the way Every. Single. Dwelling. referenced in the book (whether or not any of the characters actually spends time in it) is described down to the exact square footage (though I was interested to learn that Swedish homes are apparently vastly smaller than American ones). Or the way that the investigation of the mystery is given to us in ten page chunks that manage to stretch on endlessly without actually providing any useful information. Or... well, you get the point. When a chunk of exposition is dumped into the middle of the narrative in a TV show, it's referred to as a visit by the exposition fairy. This novel, in contrast, seems to have been entirely written *by* the exposition fairy, with the narrative fairy fighting tooth and nail to get a word in edgewise.<br /><br />And don't get me started on the way that the author describes software used by the characters and *then includes a link on where to get it*.<br /><br />The writing might have been more acceptable if the characters were good, but they aren't. Lisbeth, the highly touted eponymous character, might have improved over time, but in the first 150 pages all I learned is that she had a troubled past, is somewhat punk, is brilliant, and men fall in love with her for no reason. All of which is *told* to us. When we're actually shown what she is, it appears she's someone with good internet surfing skills who likes to poke around her boss's office when he's not in. *shrug* Said boss is even less developed, as we don't get to *see* anything about him at all and even in the telling side of things he gets less page time than his business does. As for the real protagonist of the story, the beleaguered journalist who is being unfairly persecuted by an eeeeeevil financier, all we know about him is that he's hard nosed (but not hard nosed enough to fight back against the financier, apparently), that his career was started by a lucky break, and that he's sleeping with his married coworker (which might have provided some interest except that the coworker's husband doesn't care).<br /><br />The mystery is presumably what makes this story so popular and I will admit I'm mildly interested in it. Unfortunately, despite scores of pages of relentless fact-spewing, huge holes in the mystery go entirely unexplained. For example, all suspects between the ages of 20-25 are considered in the clear. Why? Who knows! But watch out for those infants, because everyone knows it's always the baby who did it.<br /><br />To be honest, I'm hard pressed to imagine how this novel could have ever been a bestseller at all. Perhaps the writing style is what's popular in Sweden (and Europe as a whole). Perhaps a *lot* is lost in translation. Perhaps it's just that the author is dead and people are overlooking things that they wouldn't overlook in the work of a living author. Whatever the reason for its success, this novel is one of the most overrated books I've ever attempted to read and my only wish is that I hadn't wasted three hours of my life on trying to slog through the mess.s. When we're actually shown what she is, it appears she's someone with good internet surfing skills who likes to poke around her boss's office when he's not in. *shrug* Said boss is even less developed, as we don't get to *see* anything about him at all and even in the telling side of things he gets less page time than his business does. As for the real protagonist of the story, the beleaguered journalist who is being unfairly persecuted by an eeeeeevil financier, all we know about him is that he's hard nosed (but not hard nosed enough to fight back against the financier, apparently), that his career was started by a lucky break, and that he's sleeping with his married coworker (which might have provided some interest except that the coworker's husband doesn't care).    The mystery is presumably what makes this story so popular and I will admit I'm mildly interested in it. Unfortunately, despite scores of pages of relentless fact-spewing, huge holes in the mystery go entirely unexplained. For example, all suspects between the ages of 20-25 are considered in the clear. Why? Who knows! But watch out for those infants, because everyone knows it's always the baby who did it.    To be honest, I'm hard pressed to imagine how this novel could have ever been a bestseller at all. Perhaps the writing style is what's popular in Sweden (and Europe as a whole).

0307454541|3.0|I liked the characters; thought the girl, Salamader, was developed very well. I enjoyed the fact that she was not perfect---not the usual blonde bombshell. I thought the plot was confusing and the entire story went on about 100 pages too long. Too many situations where they were almost killed, too. Just too long and drug on too much for me. Succinct is a great word.
B001DD0DCI|1.0|This particular Blu-ray DVD deleted the first five minutes of the original movie, also the aspect ratio is not 1.78:1 as advertised but rather 2.40:1. Don't waste your money on this one.
B003UYUR10|5.0|I have to say, I was a little hesitant when going to see this at first, but it turned out to be fantastic! Lots of action, and keeps you interested a lot! Jake Gylenhaal plays a great role, and he is very great in this movie. 5/5
B003ICWTR4|5.0|Bruce Springsteen & E St. Band performing In Hyde Park is the best Live show out to date.  The NY Live and Live from Spain DVD's are also great, but this show blows them away. If you're on the fence about buying this DVD \\"Just Do It Already\\".   You won't regret it.
B0000AC8LR|5.0|I didn't see *Donnie Darko* in its theatrical release--matter of fact, I didn't even know it existed until I heard the song \\"Mad World\\" and found out it came from a movie. I was curious so I looked up the movie online, and what I read made me even more interested in seeing it. But I was concerned I might be bored because I knew the plot.<br /><br />So I found it on TV one night and sat watching so spellbound I didn't even change my position on the couch. About an hour into the movie, my husband came upstairs and said, \\"What are you watching?\\"<br /><br />\\"Donnie Darko.\\"<br /><br />\\"Oh. What's it about?\\"<br /><br />I had to sit there for about 30 seconds, and then the only explanation I could give was a sigh from the deepest part of my chest. And even then, when the movie was done, all I wanted to do was stare at the black TV screen for about another hour.<br /><br />So if you're worried about the surprises being ruined, rest assured it is impossible to write a spoiler for this film. Complex, layered, ambiguous, intense, and yes, dark, it is something you have to see to even begin to understand.<br /><br />The reviews here cover most aspects of the film's possible meanings, so I'm only going to add my one take. Now I'm not one to find religious messages in everything, but I'm going to go out on a limb and say I did see a few parallels between Donnie's story and the Jesus story. First, when Donnie starts telling the truth, people really resent it. The results are sometimes funny, sometimes sad, but they all have one thing in common: Nobody wants to listen because they're afraid of what they'll hear.<br /><br />Then you have Donnie's choice to accept his death. If he saves his own life, many other people's lives will be ruined; if he chooses to die, these people will be spared. And yet....Donnie dies and the motivational speaker is still mired in a horrid mess of a life; Donnie's family is devastated; and the gym teacher is still blinkering herself into a black/white paradigm. So did Donnie's death really serve any purpose? I won't give my answer to that question, because this is a film everyone must see and process for him- or herself. And this is why I would definitely recommend getting a DVD, because you need to watch it more than once to even start to sort it out.<br /><br />Very rarely does a film this powerful and affecting come along. Do not miss it!

030745455X|5.0|In lieu of so many reviews, I'll keep the synopsis of _The Girl Who Played With Fire_ short.  Picking up a year (or so) after _The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo_, Blomkvist is dealing with the celebrity from his work with the Wenenrstrom affair, and Millenium financially is doing well, planning an issue (concurrent with the publication of a book) about the seedy world of prostitution, sex trafficing and what amounts to \\"white slavery\\" - young girls (early teens) brought to Sweden to serve as prostitues.  The writers of the story are murdered, dragging Blomkvist and Salander into the mystery of who did the crime and why.<br /><br />_The Girl Who Played With Fire_ moves at a much faster pace than _Dragon Tattoo_, which was a relief.  That readers are given additional background into Salander's past - specifically why she was institutionalized and what \\"All the Evil\\" was that contributed to Salander being the intorvert she is, especially held my interest.  Apparently some did not care for the way in which Larsson showed events from the perspective of various characters - essentially \\"rewinding\\" the scene to provide another angle of the story.  I didn't mind the literary device, and in fact thought it provided addtional insight into the characters.<br /><br />I was bothered, however, by the intentional witholding of information regarding signficant plot points.  For example, Salander meets with the murder victims before they are found, leaving readers to suspect (perhaps) Salander is guilty of the crime, as the story does not provide any details of what she was doing there.  I understand that this was done to \\"build suspense\\" (and perhaps to put readers in the shoes of Blomkvist and others investigating the crime), but I found it trite.  This reservation aside, I really enjoyed the story and \\"getting to know\\" Salander better.<br /><br />As with so many book in a series, if you enjoyed _Dragon Tattoo_, you will absolutely love _Played With Fire_.  If you struggled with the pacing of the first, I would recommend this installment of the trilogy, as the \\"first act\\" (so to speak) is much more brief (the assumption being, I suppose, that we already are familiar with the protagonists).  If, on the other hand, you were among those who were bewildered at the buzz around Larsson's books, don't bother - there is nothing new here that would dissuade you otherwise.would recommend this installment of the trilogy, as the \\"first act\\" (so to speak) is much more brief (the assumption being, I suppose, that we already are familiar with the protagonists).

0061251305|5.0|The first of two books I picked up as a result of Tony Hsieh's \\"Delivering Happiness\\".<br /><br />Although nearly all the books I make the time to thoroughly read have immediately applicable material, it's been a while since I read a book that so solidly nailed several of the situations I was presently in and took immediate action.<br /><br />In fact, upon arriving at an overseas client, I shared several insights I'd already read and was applying. Then, as I was returning from this same client I read a chapter I wish I read on the outbound leg rather than the return leg! It would have been tremendously helpful in a situation I found myself in -- to get past a specific challenge.<br /><br />There was so much great material that I mostly ignored a serious flaw in one small section of the book. In fact, I imagined that the flaw was due to poor editing by the authors' publisher, and/or, that the oversight was influenced by the market at the time. In particular, the authors labeled something as \\"behaviors\\" that were patently *not* behaviors but nothing more than \\"tasks\\" in a plan... maybe even mini \\"action plans\\" in and of themselves.  But, it's a leap to get from \\"tasks\\" or \\"action plans\\" to \\"behaviors\\", and, I believe using the term \\"behavior\\" can mislead less informed readers into believing that listing tasks or the facade of planning has the same depth as truly altering behavior.<br /><br />One bit of advice for readers: The authors suggest you can skip ahead to parts of the book you might best relate to.  DON'T DO IT.  Read the whole book in the order presented.  And, stop and reflect on the summary points at the end of the major sections.  There's plenty of tactical content in the book, but reading the entire book provides the strategic context.
B0031RAOVY|1.0|Everyone says this film is about loyalty. Well, the only one who is loyal is the dog. His owner obviously loves him and cares for him. After the owner passes away the family abandons Hachi. Those who make their living at the train station; the hot dog vendor, ticket vendor, etc. say hello, pat the dog, feed him scraps (at least this is what is depicted in the movie) but no one takes him in. This dog was left to live on the street in all kinds of weather for 9 years. The owner was let down by his friends and especially his family who should be ashamed of their disregard for the dog that made him very happy through his life. I may be the only one, but I don't think this movie is about loyalty at all. Quite the opposite

0441013597|3.0|The story is supposed to take place in the distant future, on a dessert planet called Arrakis. People travel in inter-galactic transports, they ride some bird-like aircraft (\\"ornithopters\\"), use \\"lasguns\\" and some sort of energy shields to protect themselves ..<br /><br />But, underneath this thin veneer of machinery and gadgetry, the story is a very old one -- emperors, dukes and barons, witches and assassins, conflicts among imperial and aristocratic houses, palatial intrigues, quotations from the \\"O.C. Bible\\", even sword fights in a Colosseum-like arena ... and of course there is the Messiah, the one to save the world. This is supposed to be a sci-fi masterpiece, but I find the imagination lacking: besides what I listed above, there are very few imagined technological advances or scientific curiosities; most of the battles are fought with knifes and swords, and the most prized substance is a cinnamon-scented narcotic which turns your eyes blue and is essential for space travel (hard to imagine in the distant future people cannot manufacture a synthetic substitute for this). The political and social institutions, if anything, evolved even more backwards -- the societies are most feudal or slavery, and there is a band of nomads whose culture is very primitive with some funny (and manipulated) religion.<br /><br />The book is praised for the construction of a world with vivid details. But I find even that not very satisfactory. The plants are what exactly you find on earth, even their names: saguaro, creosote, sage bushes. Indeed, if you strip off the sci-fi veneer, this could very well take place in Arizona. Or in the Sahara -- actually, that would be more like it. The Freman people talk about \\"Jihad\\" and \\"Ramadhan\\" (although their religion is clearly not what you recognize as one of any real-world religions and these terms have somewhat different meanings than their orthodox definitions), you could easily imagine them being a band of Moorish people in the Sahara. And with all the witchcraft, telepathy, bloodline determining everything, feuds among baronial and ducal houses, you can easily place the setting in Medieval Europe and North Africa.<br /><br />Some of the elements in the book are not very believable (in a scientific context), such as passing one's own memory and experience through a drug-induced telepathic communication, and that one can see the future, etc. This is supposed to be science fiction; as such it should be based (at least mostly) on science. These things should be found in mythology or fantasy.<br /><br />Maybe we shouldn't be so strict about the boundary of genres. Now let me turn to the writing style. This is not an easy book to read. The writing is very baroque and quite repetitive (the characters constantly \\"swallow their dry throat\\"). Almost all the characters are with such a sense of destiny that they become very mechanical and have very little compassion (with perhaps the exception of Chani). Then at the end, there is an epic battle, but, alas, there is not much description of it at all and we skip right to the surrender. That is a bit of a letdown.<br /><br />I know there are many books in this series, and I really wanted to like it, but I think this will be the first and last book I will read in the series.witchcraft, telepathy, bloodline determining everything, feuds among baronial and ducal houses, you can easily place the setting in Medieval Europe and North Africa.

B003ITZBW2|5.0|Batman: Under the Red Hood is the latest in the DC Universe series of animated DVDs.  The two-disc DVD is very special and tells a gripping story and gives lots of great features that you'd spend hours watching.<br /><br />The main event has to do with Jason Todd, the second Robin who was beaten to death with a crowbar by the Joker and then bombed out of existence -- or so we thought.  Batman began his darkness at this time, blaming himself for Todd's death.<br /><br />I though it interesting that the writers only touched on Jason Todd as Robin, not really getting deep into the history of the character -- just enough to interest the viewer but not so much as to bore me to death with details only a rabid fan would know.<br /><br />Still, the foam began forming around my gums as Batman hunts the Red Hood.  The Red Hood was also the name of The Joker back in the day (in the comics world, in the 1940s) and so he hunts up the Joker (with some special humor appeal from Nightwing) to see what Joker knows about this Red Hood character.<br /><br />The underworld is under his pay, 40% of all they bring to the drug trade to the Red Hood and he will provide protection.  This vigilante can't stop crime, he says, so he'll join them -- and kill anyone who gets in his way.<br /><br />Great fight scenes, some ingenious moves and some flash-back stories to a younger, more vibrant Jason Todd.  The story reminded me in many ways of the Hush storyline in its action and keeping the viewer guessing as to the Red Hood's identity.<br /><br />Features:<br /><br />Lots of backstory on the Robin character, from Dick Grayson's beginnings, his development into Nightwing and the early writers and artist's reasons for giving the lone Batman a sidekick in the first place.<br /><br />Two Batman-related videos from the early 1990s, where Robin finds the killers of his parents and Batman tries to prevent him from taking revenge.  Tight story, not a slow minute.<br /><br />The previews and trailers, I've seen most of them already:  Crisis on Two Earths and so on.  However, the first look into Superman/Batman Apocalypse with Darkseid as the powerful bad guy and a complete Supergirl origin story was right out of the Supergirl comics done by Michael Turner a few years ago.  But the story is expanded and the creators of the show really exude interest and excitement for this project.<br /><br />Lastly, some Jonah Hex animated stories.  The animation is not as top notch as the feature film, but does make for some interesting storytelling.  Jonah is looking for a man who is on his bounty list.  Except the man was murdered by a madam who kills first and kisses later.<br /><br />Bottom Line:<br /><br />The story and voice-acting abilities of Batman: Under the Hood create a dark, interesting view of a Batman who seems to have created a monster, full of anguish and what he can do to rectify the Red Hood and his crime spree -- regardless of how many criminals he has to walk through to stop him.<br /><br />A must-see for any Batman fan and a great intro to the DC Animated Universe of DVDs.<br /><br />Other DC Universe Films You Must See:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B003ES5JEC Superman/Batman: Apocalypse (Two-Disc Amazon Exclusive Limited Edition with Litho Cel)]]<br />[[ASIN:B002YOKVUY Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths (Two-Disc Edition)]]<br />[[ASIN:B00023E894 Batman - The Animated Series, Volume One (DC Comics Classic Collection)]]wever, the first look into Superman/Batman Apocalypse with Darkseid as the powerful bad guy and a complete Supergirl origin story was right out of the Supergirl comics done by Michael Turner a few years ago.

0143034901|3.0|The book focuses on this boy who throughout his teenage years tries to find out what happened to the author of a book that fascinates him. The story gets increasingly complicated, revealing various passions expressed as both love and hatred, all this coinciding with a young man's passage into adulthood.<br /><br />The writing style is captivating. What makes even better is the fact that the main character is a good, likable guy in his teens. Everyone relates to those tumultuous years, the passion and despair of the first love, etc. Add a mystery to the mix and you have a good combination.<br /><br />HOWEVER... it all becomes very predictable after a while. You may not guess the exact story but you know very well where it's going. Also, I thought some characters are not well defined. This \\"bad cop\\" who is full of hatred and evil (for apparently little reason) is obsessed with some other guy's relationship and wants to destroy everything and everyone somewhat related to it. Another bad cop turns out to be a good guy after all. Another male character is once in love with a girl, and his [male] best friend seems to have only one purpose in life: to help them with their secret love affair, as if nothing else really mattered at all. He had no testosterone of his own, so he lived through his best friend? It's just hard to believe. I thought the way everything falls perfectly into place at the end was too far fetched as well.<br /><br />A decent book, but far from being great.

They sent a DVD that I can't play in the USA (Wrong Region) and then said that their mistake is not a clearly return costs paid item.  The whole issue has not been completed so we will see if they replace the one I can't use with one I can and if they refund the return shipping costs.  They said that they shipped the item \\"as ordered\\".  Why would I want a DVD that can't be played on USA players?  If I had wanted one that could be played overseas I would have asked for one, but in fact there isn't even a way to request such a product on the Amazon ordering site, that I could see, so of course never indicated such a thing.   So just be warned.  Love Amazon, but MovieMars not so much.

1594488843|5.0|I found DRIVE to be the most practical book I have read on motivation. As an experienced consultant, trainer and speaker I have read my share of books loaded with research with an academic slant, and while they may be theoretically sound they are dry as dust. Business professionals need more books like this one that don't read like an Industrial Management textbook from the 1950's.     I was booked several months ago to speak to the senior leaders at one of my client's on the topic of employee engagement and motivation. I have a standard presentation that I usually give and planned on using that. After reading DRIVE, I was so inspired that I integrated the ideas of Motivation 2.0 and 3.0 into the discussion and had an overwhelming response from the audience of validation and relief. They had observed (like most) that Motivation 2.0 wasn't working, but could not understand the dynamics of why not. Now it all made sense. I believe they have all ordered the book.
B001TOD92C|4.0|If you've ever seen \\"Fade to Black\\" ([[ASIN:B00000K0E2 Fade to Black (Ws Coll)]]) with Dennis Christopher of \\"Breaking Away\\" and \\"It\\" fame, you know what a cruddy, third-rate movie it is.  What you might also have noticed in that viewing, however, is a young Mickey Rourke who, despite a small part, clearly outshines his acting compadres.  And so it has always been with Mr. Rourke, from \\"Body Heat\\" to \\"Year of the Dragon\\" to \\"Fall Time\\" to \\"Domino\\" to \\"Sin City.\\"  Regardless of what's going on with him personally, he's always great professionally.<br /><br />Granted, Rourke is America's poster boy for bad living, but that only helps make his role in \\"The Wrestler\\" more convincing.  He plays the role of aging professional wrestler Randy \\"The Ram\\" Robinson (his first name is actually \\"Robin\\"), twenty years past his prime, living in a New Jersey trailer park, estranged from his daughter and with no caring connections in the real world.<br /><br />In fact, the whole movie might be said to be about what's real and what's fake and, regardless, does living in one versus the other matter, especially if one (the real) is more painful than the other (the fake).<br /><br />Marisa Tomei is quite fetching in her turn as the stripper love interest of Rourke's character.  Comedian Todd Barry also stars as Randy's boss at the supermarket.<br /><br />Great film.

When they find some though loyalties are put to the test. Fred especially starts to question whether or not he can trust his partners.<br /><br />  The film has it's share of action and adventure but it's mostly about greed and paranoia. Humphrey Bogart shows all those qualities in this film. I expected him to play some great heroic character, but his character is a very selfish and paranoid man.<br /><br />  I mean, when Curtin rescues Fred from a mine cave in, when he could have just left him there, Fred still questions Curtin's loyalties. Fred is too busy thinking that he's gonna lose his gold. When Howard and Curtin start to learn that there's more important things in life than striking it rich.

0307454541|4.0|I downloaded this book onto my Kindle because I had heard good things about it. When I started it, however, it didn't really grab me. I knew it was supposed to be a mysetery novel, but there were no signs of a mystery in the first 10% of the book. I ended up not reading it for a few weeks. I recently started reading/finished the book and once you got past some of the \\"framing\\" it became quite fast-paced and entertaining. You won't want to put it down! I'll more than likely be reading the other two novels in the trilogy.
9889979942|5.0|I want to share with anyone that might read this  how much I enjoyed this book. My husband ordered the book - CHINA  Portrait of a People - for us because we had recently returned from China and he knew I could not get enough of the life style we had just experienced.   When I first received the book I thought it was quite a unique size for a book of photography, but once I started looking at it I really enjoyed the small size in my hand; it made it easy to just sit on the couch with book in hand.  I liked the map of each province, and the introductions at the beginning of each province. I found myself going from picture back to the map to locate the cities.  The photographs are absolutely beautiful and captivating.  I tired to pick my favorites but can't, they are all special, they all tell a story, or capture an emotion of ancient history, beauty, the pulse of the cities and the diversity of its people.  In all, I found the book  fascinating and even more amazing was the Carter's story and journey to get this done - it is truly a life's accomplishment and Tom you should be so proud.  I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested or planing on visiting China.

However, I visited a Costco today and they have The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo AND the next title in the 3-book series for only $8.99 each softcover.  I opted to buy these paperbacks from Costco since they are part of a series.  If you are itching to buy a physical book, the Kindle version is only slightly less in price...treat yourself!<br /><br />Good buy!
B002VPE1B6|4.0|Wow. 1500+ reviews.  No one will get to this one probably, but had to say something about the film. It's glossy and a great film.  Great sound and great transfer, but I kept seeing parts of Alan Dean Foster's \\"Midworld\\" in this movie.  From the people living there and being exploited for the goods native to the world.  People living and cavorting in the trees.  Burying their dead with the forest to become one with it.  All of the world connected through plants and people.  No furcots but the people ride horses and flying steeds while having a mental connection with them (I'm thinking Dragonriders here).  The people have to fight the invaders, and the people win.  The people even have a \\"home tree.\\"  So a great movie but a rip on several books:  Midworld, The Dragonriders of Pern, and even Fern Gully.
B000S057X2|5.0|i don't have to say a lot, I just want to let you know that this movie is awesome!!! Rented the movie in the public library, and after watching it, I was like \\"I must have that movie!\\" overall, an entertaining film!!
0743297334|5.0|I never really read much Hemmingway. Sure, [[ASIN:0684830493 Old Man And The Sea (Scribner Classics)]], my Dad had it lying around when I was a kid. A month long vacation traveling through Spain seemed like a perfect opportunity to get started.<br /><br />It's a great description of \\"the expat life\\" and the Basque country was not so very different when I first traveled there in the early nineties. When I was last there in 2007 it had fast forwarded into what seemed like the 1980s. Shame.<br /><br />Two very memorable characters in Jake Barnes and Brett Ashley, forever battling the wound that will never heal. They and their motley crew have \\"a wonderful nightmare\\" at the Pamplona fiesta. I'm not going to give away the plot here but my thinking is that all of the male characters (Cohn, Bill and Mike) represent different aspects of Jake's personality that he is either suppressing (Cohn and Mike) or aspiring to (Bill). Even the great Pedro Romero - Pedro loving and Pedro fighting both bulls and men seems to represent Jake's not so subconscious. That doesn't give away the story line but see if you don't agree after reading.<br /><br />The Pamplona fiesta is mostly foreign turistas and creeps now. If you would still like to see a more authentic fiesta complete with bullfighting (though no \\"bull-running\\") try Ronda in September. Ronda is the birthplace of both bullfighting and Pedro Romero and is also featured in Hemmingway's [[ASIN:0684803356 For Whom the Bell Tolls (Paperback)]]. People travel from all over southern Spain for the fiesta. The point though, is that they are Spanish not skipping classes at Penn State.
0385504225|1.0|I hardly drop a book in the middle of the story, but this time it was too much.  I really appreciated The Da Vinci Code, so I decided to embark on Digital Fortress some time ago. Having to force myself to read it entirely, I concluded that Dan Brown was not mastering his writing yet at the time of Digital Fortress and that I should rather go to his recent novels.  With The Lost Symbol, my conclusion is rather that The Da Vinci Code might have been an exception... I did not read Angels & Demons or Deception Point, so my judgment might be biased, but I will definitely let others make a more exhaustive review. The Lost Symbol was my last Dan Brown.

B002ZG98Z0|4.0|I loved the movie because it wasn't all about DRAMA, just a fun filled romp with the girls looking Fabulous, the clothes over the top, and bringing in all of the old cast from the series.  No, the girls didn't solve global warming or world peace but they were wacky, fun, spunky and great.  I for one can't wait for another \\"Girl's Night\\"  We have enough really serious movies, I just wanted one really fun one and that's what they delivered.
B000005RRP|5.0|This item was difficult to find. I bought it used, in good shape. The album, itself, is a gem. The remastering is of high quality (as you would expect). The additional material added by Roger Glover is a joy to listen to. I expect you will have to purchase this item from a person other than a retailer, and the price may be steep. All I can say to that is, if you are a true blue fan of Deep Purple, this is a must-have item. You won't be disappointed with it. It is a very enjoyable and high quality recording.
0316044938|5.0|My son Chris was killed in a traffic accident on Thanksgiving Day in 1992, he was 19 years old.    The book accurately depicts the emotions that affect the entire family. For parents there's: guilt, anger, depression, frustration, health problems, etc. For my other son there was depression, and the sudden awareness that death can happen at any age. Too many parent's end up divorced after their child dies.    For children who are murdered or take their own life, the affects are even more severe than what we endured; I know because my (now) ex-wife and I attended a group called \\"Compassionate Friend's\\" for 2 years after our son died. Some members children took their own life, and the guilt (THEIR FAULT?!) was much more severe; for members whose children were murdered they wanted the perp caught and punished (one mother in our group kept after the police for 10 years until they caught her daughter's murderers).    Only a parent who has lost a child can understand... in many cases people who know you either don't know how to console you or enhance your grief by saying stuff you don't want to hear(i.e. you have to get on with your life). It took me almost 2 years before I could talk to someone without breaking down crying... you never stop grieving as long as you live, just learn how to control your emotions.    My guess is that the majority that gave the book a low rating have not lost a child, and don't want to think that it might happen to them some day. If you can't take the heat (a life changing tragedy) stay out of the kitchen (don't read the book and then throw stones at it)!!!

B003EYVXT6|4.0|SPLICE<br /><br />STARRING: Adrien Brody, Sarah Polley, Delphine Chaneac and Brandon McGibbon<br /><br />WRITTEN BY: Vincenzo Natali<br /><br />DIRECTED BY: Vincenzo Natali<br /><br />Rated: R<br />Genre: Science Fiction / Thriller<br />Release Date: 04 June 2010<br />Review Date: 12 July 2010<br /><br />I'm not exactly sure why I liked Splice, but I did. Even so, I won't be recommending it to anyone I don't know closely, because it's out there and isn't what most people will be expecting - especially based on its trailer.<br /><br />If you're envisioning Species, you may be let down. If you're thinking Alien; you could be disappointed. It does however; lie somewhat in-between those two great films. And it's also sprinkled with a hint of the sort of family drama you'd find in The Jerry Springer show. I know - I just lost half of you there, didn't I? Still interested? Okay, keep reading.<br /><br />Adrien Brody and Sarah Polley play Clive and Elsa; scientists as well as lovers. We quickly move on and accept that their employers are either blind to the fact, or don't seem to care that they are beyond fraternizing. A good deal of the film rests on the shoulders of the merit of their relationship, and their on-screen allure makes those portions believable as well as entertaining; mostly by Adrien Brody. He's such a likeable guy, and a terrific actor.<br /><br />I'll admit Splice takes it's time getting to the point, but I was never bored with it. The - `two characters in a room for prolonged periods of time' approach was handled with care; and there is a very subtle hint of `what the hell is gonna happen?' - teasing those hairs on the back of our necks for the first 30 minutes or so.<br /><br />After advisors shut down their project, Clive and Elsa secretly push forward with their experiment of splicing animal and human DNA. There must be some kind of strict Hollywood code in Sci-Fi movies, that forces the writers to script the purpose for DNA splicing to involve `the better of mankind', because it's seems like that's always the reason. It is here too.<br /><br />If you're not asleep by the end of act one, you may enjoy seeing the creature Clive and Elsa have well... spliced. I've certainly never seen anything like it, and was astronomically impressed. A blend of some barely visible CGI and beautiful make-up effects and voila; an original movie monster at last! The actress they hire to play the thing soon named Dren (Delphine Chaneac), does an amazing job at making her convincing, interesting and somehow even slightly attractive.<br /><br />If you think you can predict where this film is headed, you may be surprised. It is essentially three films in one; each act taking a sharp turn into something else. Several viewers will despise the third act entirely. While it wasn't my first choice of destinations for the film to take me to, I wouldn't say I had the worst time with it.ason. It is here too.

0143038419|5.0|Fun, entertaining, light-hearted and profound at the same time, without being pretentious.<br /><br />If you're like me and have a weakness for stories of getting lost in the unknown only to rediscover yourself by making the hard decision of starting once again from scratch in totally new surroundings, and the excitement that goes along with it, this is definitely a must-read.
B003EV6DBM|5.0|BBC-America, where first-run \\"Doctor Who\\" episodes air in the 'states', is not available to everyone on every cable/satellite system-subscription.  Current fans don't need a review ... we're hooked and can't get loose.  So ... if you've come here intrigued about what you've heard, but are not sure what it's all about, then Season 5 may be just what you need.  It stands on its own for newcomers and old fans like me, alike.  Once you've become a fan, then get modern seasons 1-4 with Mssrs. Eccleston and Tennant as previous, highly regarded leads as the \\"Doctor\\".<br /><br />There is no way to bring one up to speed on 37 years of series history in a few words.  Following great series seasons under Russell Davies lead, Steven Moffat has taken the reigns for a revamped Season 5 with a new Doctor (Matt Smith), new companions (Karen Gillan as Amy and Arthur Darvill as Rory) and compelling episodes wrapped in a season-long story line that concludes with the best 2-part season finale ever crafted in the series, as my take.  Mr. Moffat's nickname should be \\"Captain Hook\\" for leaving fans hooked at the end of a rope with questions:<br /><br />Why did the Doctor take Amy along in the Tardis for 'no reason at all'? (ep.1 revealed in ep.13)<br />Why is there a crack in the universe in her bedroom wall? (ep. 1/13)<br />What is 'the silence'?  When will it 'descend'? (ep. 1/13 and to be continued)<br />Who is River Song? (Alex Kingston, no less and the question is finally asked)<br />Why does she always encounter the Doctor in the wrong place in time?<br /><br />You will NOT get these subtleties in some of the time-edited re-runs; BBC is goofy about that.  Nor is its re-run schedule predictable or in sequence.  Another hit on BBC - for reasons unknown, many of the fan extras, such as \\"Doctor Who at the BBC Proms\\" are all but impossible to get in the states and do not run on BBC-America ... huh??.<br /><br />Then, Murray Gold's updated scores wrap it all up in a nice package with some music that can stand alone.  For a sample, search YouTube for \\"Doctor Who at the Proms 2010\\" and check out the video for \\"I Am the Doctor\\".  Go ahead ... open a new browser window and find it ... I'll wait ....<br /><br />If you liked that, search the Prom for \\"This is Gallifrey/Vale Decum\\", a fan favorite many have trouble watching. It details the regeneration of the revered David Tennant as he morphs into Matt Smith amid concerns no one could equal Tennant.  Not to worry ... Smith quickly came to own the role in his own way.  Give it a try ....<br /><br />If you liked that, then you really do have a fancy for mad-cap, off-the-plot science fiction with compelling and refreshing British/Scottish actors who bring hilarious mayhem cloaked in serious drama and fabulous music.  Consider DVD - OR - Amazon's very well done download system with the full season at $13-bucks in good looking hi-def under a Windows 7 system.  Start with the free preview, then plunge in.  Check requirements for a more dated computer.  The audio and video clarity is BETTER than the BBC-America first-runs on television.  As the Doctor would say, \\"... no peaking and no 'spoilers'.\\"  The ending makes no sense without the beginning. Just sit back, relax and get ready for a roller coaster ride with the Doctor and Amy Pond.  Smashing and brilliant.search YouTube for \\"Doctor Who at the Proms 2010\\" and check out the video for \\"I Am the Doctor\\".  Go ahead ... open a new browser window and find it ...

0151013837|3.0|The biggest problem I had while reading this book was my underlying thought that it was supposed to blow me away; everyone I knew had read this book three to eight years ago, so I felt behind the trend. In fact, I read this book predominantly because I felt the need to inhale this wonderful piece of literature I'd been missing. My experience, though, was that it was a 300 page \\"You had to have been there.\\"<br /><br />Don't get me wrong; the book was good. But it was not great. There was this lure in the beginning of religious symbolism and parallelism. Before leaving India, Pi had wanted to practice three different religions at the same time; as a teenager he has this earthy, spiritual side that was just begging to have more of a presence. Being trapped on a boat in the middle of the ocean with (depending on the point in the story) one to four zoo animals could have represented much more than being trapped on a boat in the middle of the ocean with one to four zoo animals. The actual acts of survival--learning how to fish, learning how to collect fresh water, learning to assemble a raft, etc.--were described in a very dry, matter-of-fact tone. The emergence of animalistic urges, like tearing into a fish with bare hands and teeth for example, were significantly better-written and much more heart-wrenching to read. However, for a boy who had talked so much before the shipwreck of finding the perfect religious blend, there were shockingly no doubts of faith during this time, no conversations with higher beings, no inner-conflict at all really. In a few instances Pi said he missed his family, or that keeping Richard Parker (the tiger) alive kept him alive, but it was all too little and too random to have that great of an impact. Even the scene on the meerkat island with the nocturnally lethal \\"land\\" and the tree with human teeth for fruit--even this was begging to have deeper meaning, instead of just seeming like a bizarre, pointless piece of plot.<br /><br />The ending tried to reconcile this lack of depth. Up until the ending, Pi had been telling his story including all the animals and side-adventures. Then he quickly retells it replacing all the animals with human beings and deleting some of the side-adventures. He asks his listeners which story is more believable and--more importantly--which story they would rather believe. The two versions so beautifully intertwine that as a reader you suddenly doubt whether or not the previous 300 pages was the \\"real\\" story or not. Truly this is the best part of the book, both from a plot perspective as well as from a writing perspective.<br /><br />One last thing structurally about the book: I had the \\"Deluxe Illustrated Edition.\\" The illustrations were absolutely breath-taking. The colors at times were more vibrant than the story and it certainly is not a waste of money buying this edition. The artist should be commended for his job; he showed quite a bit of variety and talent in just 40 illustrations.<br /><br />Overall, this book is \\"okay.\\" Again, it's by no means a horrible read, and the ending does a great job of redeeming earlier transgressions (though it does not completely eradicate them). It would probably make a \\"safe\\" gift for a young teen. It would be a good beach read--though perhaps not great to bring on a cruise. This book may continue to be popular for a few more years, though I will be shocked if it is still considered such a classic in another ten or fifteen years.le this lack of depth.

B000PMLFRA|4.0|I can't contribute anything more poignant than has already been written on this topic, but what has compelled me to put finger to plastic are three things.    Firstly, I wonder if Mr Lucas or any of his closest confidants DO actually take the time to read any of these comments. Most of us assume that the rich and famous don't have access to \\"our world\\" and instead shut themselves away in their ivory towers with \\"special stuff\\". But how hard is it to log onto amazon and search for a product?  You are here reading it - how easy was that?    So maybe he does read stuff, even if just out of mild curiosity.    In which case, the general vibe I am getting reading all this is one of betrayal. People seem to feel deprived or cheated of the one thing (the only thing in this instance) they desire. To underline this, I am of course talking about an HD version of the original theatrical releases of ANH, ESB and (because it would be churlish to ignore it) ROTJ. Uncut, Unimproved, and completely Unforgettable.    This leads me nicely to my second point. The reason we all feel so impassioned about this subject is because it is part of us (even those of you that have \\"moved on\\" and don't care anymore). Trust me, I know exactly what you mean and how you feel, but if you are really honest, isn't some tiny, insignificant, brilliant and beautiful part of you, still that little boy or girl who was first captured by this amazing soap opera set in space.    It is worth reminding ourselves at this juncture, that this particular opera was conjured up in the genial mind of George Lucas and no matter what else is said or done, I for one will always be grateful for what he gave us. He doesn't \\"owe us\\" anything. We however, will forever be in his debt.    The more discerning among us figured out a long time ago (indeed in a galaxy far far away) that this \\"debt\\" did not include buying every lame reinvented, repackaged \\"special edition\\" that hit the stores. No, we decided to wait... in the hope that one day our wish would be answered. I sense we are large in number...    I have deliberately avoided until now mention of TPM, AOTC, & ROTS because (as most fans of the originals will concur) they were... somewhat disappointing. To many they have \\"spoilt\\" the entire universe that we so lovingly clung to all those years while in real life we actually just grew up. I came to realise that these films were not really aimed at us (mostly 30 somethings) and were in fact aimed at a whole different generation. Shrewd move perhaps. I certainly know many kids that thought the prequels were pretty cool. Maybe this was the intended target audience. The ones that are gonna buy the action figures today!    Mr Lucas, If these films are released, they can be safely messed with to your hearts content. It is unlikely to win over any original fans but the kids will probably love it!    This brings me to my last point (thanks for hanging in with me!)    The target audience for the original films was undeniably us (albeit us when we were much younger). We may all be kidding ourselves that this innocence will ever be recaptured, but we have the absolute right to dream that it might. One thing is for sure - tampered versions do not rekindle youth. At best they are jarring and I personally find them oddly offensive.     I firmly believe that IF (and that's a big IF) the films are released in their original guise, they will become the biggest selling Blu Ray discs in history. Do the math.    In short Mr Lucas you had us all at hello... or should I say, you had us all at \\"Did you hear that?\\"
B0026RHR6K|5.0|I bought all of the seasons separately as they first came out, and I highly recommend watching the entire television series through to the end. The five stars are for the series, NOT for the atrocious marketing.<br /><br />While looking for the last piece of the series (see the end of the review), I came across some great deals (in terms of price), but was dismayed to see just how confusing things have become on Amazon. This review below is meant to help you wade through the mess in the marketplace, purchase the series, and enjoy it. I originally posted it for the combined Seasons 4.0 and 4.5 set, but someone kindly suggested I post it elsewhere as well. I hope you find it helpful.<br /><br />DVD CONFUSION<br />-------------------------------------------------------<br />The show is incredible. However, the whole DVD thing has been a disaster. They released it in the worst way possible (see below), Amazon compounded the problem by lumping together reviews for DIFFERENT PRODUCTS, and the DVD manufacturers seem to be changing the contents of some products. I cannot imagine how someone who is not deeply familiar with it is supposed to purchase this wonderful show. Certainly, they would hesitate to give it as a gift!
