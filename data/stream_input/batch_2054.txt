B003UBTX6S|5.0|I love this series. It was gripping. I read all four books in three days! The love story is great. The family bonds and friendship is amazing. I am so glad I read this series. I probably cried 20x while reading this.
B00A8KJK7G|3.0|I didn't liked the film because the story was too simple.<br /><br />And there is not one original moment in the story.<br /><br />I thought that it's maybe for a few people who enjoyed his short version of Frankenweenie only.<br /><br />Even as a crazy Tim Burton's fan, I still don't like the movie.<br /><br />I was right.<br /><br />I bought the DVD and I still didn't liked it.<br /><br />But becasue I bought it in Korea, they gave me a thick Frankenweenie original magazine.<br /><br />I truely enjoyed the magazine, so I don't feel regret buying this DVD anymore.<br /><br />But those who buy in the US, there is no original magazine included.<br /><br />Sad for you guys. Truely Sad.<br /><br />The magazine seems everything to me.
142314189X|5.0|There isn't enough I can say about this series. It is fabulous! I am a big fan of Greek mythology and as soon as I started the Lightening Thief I was completely sucked into Percy's world (often staying up until 4am just to see what happens next). It is a fast paced series that I finished in 5 days. The characters are so likable and realistic that you feel like you are going on the quests along with them. I absolutely love how Riordan intertwines Greek mythology with the present. I often caught myself trying to remember the mythological stories in order to guess what monsters they will have to face next and how they were originally killed/defeated. Many times I was left surprised by all of the twists and turns, it definitely keeps you on your toes. I strongly suggest this book to anyone who likes Greek mythology, sci-fi, mystery, suspense, and action packed adventure!
B005CKPQNE|5.0|love it just wish it was part of my prime package! i wish there were more seasons - i watch it on the elliptical in the morning

B00A0NOF7G|5.0|I got this book when it was a free Kindle book, however, I will say that I would have been willing to pay for this book. It was a quick, fun and enjoyable read. I am usually able to pick the killer before the end, but I will admit that I was pleasantly surprised that I had no idea until right at the end who was the killer. I can say that I have found a new cozy series and author that I will read more of.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|Love all the new designs in the game visualy looks great. The new power ups makes it differant as well. The controls are very slow on my note2 have yet to find a game this phone would not handle. Hope for a update

B00APUYWYA|4.0|I wasn't sure that I wanted to spend money to see this in the theater, but after hearing great reviews from friends, I decided to check it out on Amazon Instant.  I was pleasantly surprised that the movie was funny, though it was predictable.  The songs were fantastic, and even though I don't really like musicals, I really enjoyed this movie.

B001NLL93W|5.0|Last month, a friend of mine recommended that I begin the Mortal Instrument series. I, being a huge Harry Potter, Hunger Games, Divergent, and Delirium fan, was a little skeptical at first. However, I was soon so involved with the books that it was all I could do to not to skip ahead. I literally did nothing but read for days. In City of Glass many revelations are made. So many in fact that if I had not known there were more books I would have thought that it might have been the end. BIG changes occur with almost all the characters and new ones are introduced. Right now, I am just beginning Book 5, City of Lost Souls and I can't wait. It's definitely my newest fandom. I don't know how I didn't read them before I did! They're incredible.
1891252089|4.0|This book is a must have for those who wish to get involved with Ashtanga Yoga.  He really goes into detail for all of the poses in the primary series, and discusses the different options for those who are not as advanced. He also describes exactly how to do a jump through, which is really helpful for those of us who are beginners who simply jump between their feet and not all the way into sitting.  Some of the pictures can be a bit intimidating, but it does give you something to reach for.
B006CHML4I|5.0|Excellent watch, excellent packaging. Item sent as described. Seiko watches are very resistant, I am &#34;heavy hand&#34; for any watch and this one comes with a very hard crystal. The brace with metalic rings is a good idea.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|A lot better than the first one!  It is fun and you get to go into mines. Love the \\"big\\" Monkey...seriously KUDO's on the monkey!
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I'm going to start by just saying The Mortal Instruments is a must read! Not only was I a fan almost instantaneously, but now I can't put the series down. It's also a plus that City of Bones is filming as we speak and will come out in theaters in August of 2013. I'm a Harry Potter/Hunger Games/Divergent junkie, and this is hands down right up there with them. City of Bones has everything: Nail-Biting Action, Forbidden Love, and Comedic Relief. Jace is my favorite character and I can't help but be in love with him! I guarantee that you won't be disappointed!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Nice and easy to use, good fun. Recommended for all ages whether you are horsey or not it's simple to play.

B008602KQI|1.0|Where's the story? Why do these people want to watch 12 year olds kill each other? Why is society split between psychopaths with crazy hairdos living in the year 3000, and seemingly normal people living in the 19th century? Is that Will Smith's son or is that a girl? Oh, I guess it doesn't matter now because he/she is already dead. Are the CGI computer dogs computer generated by the computer forest or are they supposed to be real dogs made by the computer forest? And if the CGI computer dogs are CGI then is the CGI city a real city or a computer manifested city? Is this like the Matrix? The computer dogs must be CGI within CGI because the deer at the beginning was real. At least it wasn't as bad as the equally overrated Battle Royale. If you're over 20 years of age and your neurological development hasn't already been retarded by an overexposure to \\"young-adult fiction\\" titles like the Hunger Games then you probably won't like this movie.<br /><br />It's just that bad.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Great book couldnt put it down.  This is one of the best books I have read in a while.  Recommended it to all of my friends.
0425252868|5.0|This is without a doubt one of the finest books about the air war in WWII I have ever read. Having the honor to have met many flyers from the 8th Air Force it really brings home the emotions they displayed when dicussing their experiences. More importantly, it let's the reader see conflict from both sides and in doing so shows that we are not so different. \\"A Higher Call\\" also provides a valuable insight into the leadership of the Luftwaffe and how they helped the allies win the war. The real message of this book is that even in heat of combat there can be humanity. Best wishes to all who read \\"A Higher Call\\". Andrew L. Hastings, MSgt(Ret), USAF
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Hopeless is as far from hopeless as it could possibly be! Rather courageous, strong, stubborn, beautiful and full of hope!<br /><br />Sky has been home schooled her whole life, but for her senior year in high school, she has managed to persuade her mother to let her go to the local school so she can get ready to go to college later. Just as Sky is getting ready to go to an actual school for the first time, her best friend and next-door-neighbor Six is leaving for a year abroad. Because Six is very friendly with boys, she has quite a reputation in school, and that reputation has kind of trickled down to Sky as well, just because she's been hanging out with guys as well and of course, since she and Six are best friends.<br /><br />Hopeless really isn't about high school drama, though, it is about Sky, and Dean. How they both have to deal with gossip and nasty reputations, and how they fall in love and Sky is finally feeling something when she is with a boy, and about how they both need to deal with the past. At the same time as Sky starts feeling something, she is having dreams as well. About a past she cannot remember. She knows she is adopted, and that she was in the foster system until she was four years old, but she never had any actual memories of what happened before she became Karen's adopted daughter.<br /><br />Sky has not had the same kind of life that Six has had - not only because she was home schooled, but also because Karen has a very strict no-electronics thing going on at home. They have no TV, computers or cell-phones, and while I can appreciate that some people want to be able to be off-line when at home, it did seem a little strange as well. When Six leaves for Europe, her goodbye present for Sky is a cell-phone, that she keeps hidden from Karen.<br /><br />The relationship between Karen and Sky is a very good one, for once, there is a parent who is really present for her teenager, even if she also trusts Sky and lets her make a lot of her own decisions. Apart from her strange and disturbing dreams, Sky seems to be well-adjusted. The writing is extremely well done, it flows easily, the prose is beautiful, and the characters are all fleshed out! Even minor characters are described and showed in a way that made me feel like they were real, and that is a huge plus in my opinion.<br /><br />Dean is a very complex character, and since the readers get to know him through Sky, her judgment of him color our own. I was a little wary of him in the beginning, even with all the warning signs telling me not to listen to gossip, I made the very same mistake that Sky made - I believed the things I learned about him from second or third hand<br /><br />At the same time, Dean is also quite volatile in the beginning, we never know if he is going to be nice or nasty, happy or angry. As things move quickly between Sky and Dean, it is still easy to understand how she gets so caught up in him, because there is a depth to him that is really amazing. Sky and Dean seem to really get each other, they are both outsiders in high school, and they both have to fight against the gossipers who have nothing better to do with their free time than to make stuff up about people they don't really know.<br /><br />As the story moves forward, the mystery of Sky's past becomes more and more present, until her memories almost explode. The aftermath of her remembering everything, and then realizing that someone else knew some of it as well was heartbreaking to read about. What she had to relive made me cry, and in some instances I had goose-bumps seeing how she was sorting through her memories to find some kind of peace within herself. She showed an immense strength, and she only got stronger as she worked through her past.<br /><br />To make sure I don't spoil anything, I will stop here - but I urge you: Get this book and read it! You need a quiet place so you can just read without stopping, and the time to do so as well. You also need a lot of tissues, but know that there are a lot of both happy and romantic moments as well - all is not sad - as I said in the beginning, there truly is hope throughout the whole narrative, and that might be part of what made Hopeless so beautiful to me.<br /><br />*** Favorite quotes ***<br />Everything Six eats is only eaten to compliment her main course of Nutella. Tonight, she's having a cheese and Nutella sandwich. I don't know if I could ever acquire a taste for that.<br /><br />I'm really hoping he's being genuine because I can already tell he isn't the kind of guy a girl gets a simple crush on. He's the kind of guy you fall hard for, and the thought of that terrifies me.<br /><br />\\"So you get the house to yourself and you spend Friday night baking? Typical teenager,\\" he says mockingly. \\"What can I say?\\" I shrug. \\"I'm a rebel.\\"<br /><br />Passionate. He's passionate about life, about love, about his words, about Les.

0439813786|5.0|I loved this book! It was simple, easy and quick to read, and is a great book for anyone of any age or preference of reading material. It's a perfect book! When I first went to buy the book for my Book Club in High School, I was very weary of getting it. I thought it was quite expensive (since I had to way of income for myself and my parents aren't fond of giving me $20 for a book), and then I thought it was really heavy and thick, but once I opened it up and started reading it--I was done in just hours, not even. It was simple but amazing-holds your attention throughout the whole thing and is just an amazing book! I recommend at least borrowing it from someone if you can't afford to buy it
B003ODIZL6|5.0|This was a great way to get my homework done it is a great dictionary one of the best I've ever read

B005K0HDGE|5.0|Love this book.  I was a little hesistant as some Stephen King novels can be a little on the scary side.  Since I read right before sleeping this is not the ideal way to fall asleep.  However, this book is engaging and enthraling, so much so that I find it hard to put it down.  Time travel is the foundation of the story and the reader finds himself transported to the 50's and 60's.  Very interesting how times have truly changed!
B0064W639K|4.0|Batman: The Long Halloween is one of the seminal works of the modern Batman mythos. It is a chapter in a series of Batman comics stories that tell the tale of the early stages of the Caped Crusader's crime-fighting career. It is, in fact, still mostly in continuity after the Flashpoint crisis crossover event rebooted the DC Universe.<br /><br />The story begins during Batman's second year as a crime-fighter. At this point, Gotham City is still ruled by the iron fist of organized crime. The \\"freaks\\", as the costumed super-villains are called, are just emerging, and are yet to become a real power in Gotham. But all of that is changing as Batman's actions against the families, with his allies on the police force lead by Captain Jim Gordon, are making an impact, and proving the mob to be vulnerable.<br /><br />Amid this backdrop comes a new serial killer whom the newspapers dub \\"the Holiday Killer\\" due to his or her penchant for striking on holidays and leaving holiday-themed calling cards at the murder scenes. Batman and Gordon struggle to take down this new menace, while supporting their friend, District Attorney Harvey Dent. But Dent may not be the man they all think that he is....<br /><br />One of my favorite parts of this story was that it really did answer the question that so many fans have asked, that being whether or not the criminals are somehow \\"created\\" by Batman. The scene at the end of Batman Begins where Gordon spoke of \\"escalation\\" alluded to this question. This story seems to answer that question as a flat \\"no\\". Crime and horrific evil would always be in Gotham. If it is not the so-called \\"super-villains\\", it would be the mob and random degenerates.<br /><br />The fact is that Gotham is a crooked, corrupt city that needs Batman to fight evil, inspire hope, and help necessitate change. Evil will always be there, but a few good men and women like Batman, the various Robin, Nightwing, Jim Gordon, Batgirl, even Catwoman, etc., can fight that evil and bring about much good. And Batman will never rest in this battle, as he promised his parents, in a way that this graphic novel very poignantly made clear.<br /><br />The panels and art were great in this issue, though I wish they had not portrayed Poison Ivy as so ridiculous looking. She's a plant-themed villain with powers over plants, but she is not herself supposed to be a tree! She looks ridiculous. The other issue here was that this was a few years back where Batman was still being depicted as seven feet tall and 500 pounds of muscle or something. Overall, the art work was great stuff, but some of the characters were rendered in such ridiculous ways that it sort of \\"pulled\\" you out of the tale.<br /><br />Despite the above (minor) criticism, this is definitely a read I would recommend.about much good.

B005G5PPGS|5.0|...especially if you are not a big baseball fan. I'm not familiar with terms or baseball metrics, making it equally harder for me to follow. However, I was so intrigued by it and with my background in analytics, I found it fascinating that businesses thrive on statistical data to optimize and improve the bottom line and yet baseball's powers that be think that they are beyond such things. The \\"insiders\\" that the book tells us about are the high priests in this religion and the \\"outsiders\\" are the atheists and blasphemers telling the great unwashed that the gods didn't exist because of facts. Anyway a great read and highly recommended.

B009KS4XRO|4.0|I love this game and I play it on a regular basis, it has a variety of games to play. My biggest complaint is the facebook comments get out of control by several of the participants, especially the young players.
B002ZG976U|4.0|its a cute movie.  Has great music.  The cast is fun and energetic. Overall I liked it. I would recommend to others.
B008NA3I30|4.0|This is a romantic drama about a Margot, (Michelle Williams -`My Week with Marilyn') who whilst scouting for a job crosses the path of Daniel (Luke Kirby). They share seats on the flight home and then a cab and as luck would have it he has only recently moved in opposite her house in what looks like an idyllic little road. It is quite obvious that there is a big spark going on between them but as he exits the taxi she drops the bombshell that she is married.<br /><br />Well as with all dramas worth their salt Daniel, who is a rickshaw puller by day and an unexhibited artist by night, keeps up the gentle persuasion and Margot does the minimum to deter his advances. Meanwhile life for Margot and cookery, writer hubby, Lou, (Seth Rogen -`The Green Hornet' and `Kung Fu Panda 2') carry on as normal with overt displays of affection and extended family life. The problem is Lou is just a really nice bloke, and a loving husband, so will she do the right thing or jump into the back of the rickshaw for a free ride or two?<br /><br />This is a film that whilst firmly set in the rom/drama model actually hits a few clich&eacute; land mines at the start and then goes all out to avoid them and become a very grown up story of love, relationships and heart break. There is some very adult language, frontal nudity and gratuitous smooching on m ore than one occasion.<br /><br />The nice thing is that all of the players are given a fair shot at the limelight and are presented as real people rather than bit players in someone else's life and I really appreciate that in a film. The sound track is rather good too with at least a couple of contributions from Micah P. Hinson, oh yes and The Buggles - trust me it works. This is a Canadian production from director and writer Sarah Polley who has made a rather good film that should appeal to all those who like a bit of reality injected into their romantic drama.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Thouroughly enjoyed this Harry Bosch novel. It kept me guessing throughout the story as to the next twist or turn. I absolutely loved it.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|My kiddo loves it.  Happy it was free!  He is seven years old and very appropriate for his age group.
B004EPZ07K|5.0|ok, when it comes to Ryan Reynolds, you just cant go wrong.  If anything, he is nice to look at. right?<br />But movie itself was good too.  If you are a fan of comic books/xmen/etc... you would like this as well.
B004J4WNL2|4.0|Excellent research and perspective of the power of the introvert in social and interpersonal relationships. I also will value the information about leadership in decision making circumstances.

B004J4WKUQ|5.0|If you have ever been into gaming, even just a little, this book will blow your mind. Ernest Cline managed to touch gamers from all styles and factions from all walks of gaming life. A phenomenal book that had me reading on the beach while others were surfing, reading in the car while others were ready for a big night out, and kept me entertained all the way through.<br /><br />Such a great read.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|So good ugh! Heart wrenching...probably my favorite of the three ..if it's even possible to break them up lime that. This is humanity in a nutshell I loved it.

My mother has quite a few vinyl records that she's had since I was a child (which incidentally was about the last time I had heard them) and a broken record player that she has had for many years. When I went home for Christmas I ordered it on Amazon and had it sent there.<br /><br />Shipping was quick, the present was awesome, and Dan Fogelberg made a reappearance.

B001O1O71C|4.0|I found  this book a very interesting commentary on the emotions of the innocent who simply learn what they are told. The pointy of view was very effective. I was not a huge  fan of  the  ending. I felt it was lacking. After readers have gone on this adventure with characters, they deserve more in the ending.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love it and so does my big brother, we play it about all the time.<br />U should try it out!!!!!!!!!
B00846REIS|5.0|Couldn't put it down.  The writing brought me into the character's feelings.  It kept me wanting more.  Can't wait for the next one.
B00ACBN9CI|3.0|this is a memory hog and doesn't run smoothly on the Stratosphere. The &#34;free&#34; version is very limited and the controls are a bit choppy.
0345803485|5.0|I really loved the whole trilogy of Fifty Shades. I've read them over and over again. I would tell someone they should read the whole trilogy.  Thumbs up!!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Amazing game always fun great time passer love it even better than the first love the ziplines and the mine cart but fix the bugs! -kindle fire hd 8.9
B0081FO2Q4|5.0|I bought this album because I liked one song and it turns out that Ed is a great singer/songwriter. Awesome album and I would now gladly pay full price after hearing it in its entirety. I'm am satisfied with this purchase. Highly recommend this album.
0446343129|5.0|This book also is a must if you are concerned at all about your sugar intake.  I read it years ago.  I was pleased they still had it in print.
0345803493|5.0|I Really loved this book. I've read it over and over again. In fact I've read all read all three books over and over.  And yes I would tell someone they should read the whole trilogy. Thumbs up!
B003TSEEDY|4.0|It was a good book, but I wouldn't recommend it for younger kids. But I do think it's a very inspiring story.
B0088TG252|5.0|watched this on my Kindle during a flight from Connecticut,,  was a pretty good movie,  is defiantly a good airplane ride rental.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Really great read--book came to life through the words of the author.  One of the best book I have read.
0345803507|5.0|I Really loved this book. I have read it over and over again. In fact I've read all three books over and over again.  Thumbs up!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|this game is awesome! i would give it a five star but.... some times when you click on the game, it will some times go back to your home screen. other wise, I LOVE IT!!! i also have temple run 1 and its a good game too. if theres any way i could contact imangi studios, i would tell them to fix the game. im just happy that temple run 2 does not shut down my kindle like some of my other stupid games. other wise, GET THIS GAME!!!
B000HF6XV8|2.0|I bought this for my 7 year old's birthday along with the movie Matilda.  She loved Matilda, but only made it through about 30 minutes of this one.  This just doesn't hold the attention of younger kids.  We'll have to hold on to it until she is older.
B001AI7KAE|5.0|Great Stuff ! ! !<br /><br />If you like this group this is a must have.  The songs that I have liked for years and years are all on this disk.  There are like 4 or 5 songs that I have never heard before and am not crazy about right now are also very very good.  This group is awsome.  I have been looking for this CD for many years and found it within one minute on Amazon.com.  And I am not just saying that cus the founder is from Cotula, TX right down the road on IH 35 from where I live in San Antonio, TX or because they are building a multimillion dollar Distribution Center right up the road in Schertz, TX but I am seriously impressed.  Me and my wife have been listening to it full blast in the truck all weekend long.  I would definitely recomend you to get this CD.  It will definitely rank in my top 10 CDs I have bought in 25 years and I would go as far as to say it is in the top 5.  I cant think of any better right now but I just may.  If you are on the fence on this CD let me give you a little push over the edge, dont think about it, just BUY IT !
B007BFSYMS|4.0|Has as wide variety of sounds available. I've used a white noise machine for awhile, but the one I have uses batteries with no AC option. That was starting to get pricey so when this cane up ad the FAOTD I thought I would give it a shot. works just as well and gives me lots of choices. I'm extremely happy with it.
B003EYVXTG|4.0|A young, willful teenage girl conducts a desperate hunt for her father, amidst the grey skies and brown, snow-kissed hills of an Ozark Mountain winter. It's a tough, winding trail that traverses thorny conversations with her cold, lip-zipped relatives as well as the bleak, desolate Missouri wilderness. The selfish restraint of nearly every face in this young girl's world is infuriating - by the closing chapters I wanted to see them all brained with a baseball bat - but it's not that kind of a story. Instead, the film takes a note from its young, headstrong protagonist and simply endures, waiting for the storm to blow itself out to see what's left behind. Jennifer Lawrence shines in the difficult leading role, balancing responsibility with determination, and enjoys plenty of help from a rich, convincing supporting cast. It's also quite appropriately shot, with a focus on rural poverty and a permeating lack of color. Bleak, dark and emotionally exhausting, it's a powerful bit of cinema, but not something I could bear to watch multiple times.
B0083H6AQA|5.0|I loved this movie. I would have gone to the movies to see it but it never came to Austin.
B004ZN9RWK|5.0|Whether you have heard this for the very first time or over 100 times it never gets old. Still one of the best albums ever recorded.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I was sceptical about how they could beat temple run and temple run brave but they did and it is awesome
B000QRIGJY|4.0|If you've enjoyed the other books in the Harry Bosch series, you will likely enjoy this one as I did.  We have glimpses of some of the past characters, otherwise, it's also fine as a stand alone book.  Good police procedural.
B00168OINK|5.0|I only buy blu ray movies because the picture quality is awesome and this movie did not disappoint me not at all!!  The picture quality is simply beautiful anda veryaffordable price!
B00280LYIC|5.0|If you are looking for an amazing book to read, it may be closer than you think.<br />Rick Riordan is excellent at making this book come alive! And if you've read this book, read the rest of them. They get better and better, if possible!!! 5*. *****, definitely!
B00AVPYT8I|1.0|when I follow directions I can not get more than 10 books to be displayed. when I press load more books the screen reverts back to previous page .
B0011UJMK2|5.0|I bought this book as a kindle deal.  Although the writing itself was fine, I almost put it down-- only because of my weak stomach.  I found the descriptions of life in this Stalin era too depressing.  I guess in my middle ages, I personally don't want to read things that depress me too much.  I think I also had a hard time with the child murderer- following in the heels of recent US history.  At any rate, these are just factors of where I was at the time I read the book.  I stuck with it and became completely engrossed in the story.  It has a very likable main character (in that he is very human yet almost too honorable to be human) and a fast paced story line.  I highly recommend it.
B005HSG3U6|5.0|Love love love it.  Fits my fire perfectly and i am also able to put it in a case i had purchased a while go.  Its one of the best purchases i have made for my fire.
B005O7Q6FM|1.0|From the start to the finnish it would pause and have to rechash ....dont waste your money!!! Needs major improvment
B004X6PRO6|3.0|Its a long story.  It seems to be pointing out how things really are in N. Korea so it is not so much a story to be read for pleasure or entertainment as it is to learn or educate.
B0002E5O9G|5.0|I saw the 10th anniversary performance on PBS several years ago and just recently saw the movie.  I wanted to listen to the music again and again so this CD is now one of my favorites and I have listened to it 5 or 6 times.  The most moving part (for me) was the &#34;parade&#34; of former Jean Valjeans at the end of the performance singing &#34;Do you hear the people sing?&#34; in their native language.  (I would like to order the DVD of this performance.)<br />  &#34;Master of the House&#34;  brings a smile;  &#34;Red and Black&#34; is powerful;  &#34;Bring Him Home&#34; makes me pull over to the side of the road because my tears make it dangerous to drive;  and the finale makes me want to stand and cheer because of the talented cast!!  This is a once in a lifetime performance.  Thanks!
030758836X|2.0|This book was interesting throughout, until the last few chapters.  Worst ending ever!  The Soprano's had a better finale! I was actually upset with the conclusion and felt the read was a waste of time.
B008133MDK|5.0|There simply is nothing better (in the Holmes world) than Cumberbatch's version. These 'episodes' could stand on their own as 'art' films anywhere. They are engaging, sophisticated and a well-written modern-day version of Holmes and Watson.
B009SJ3GUK|4.0|I really enjoyed this season although I kind of enjoyed the first season better. Very dark twisty but still very entertaining.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|cant stop playing it. this game is addiciting. the motions are so life like. it makes me miss my horses.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I can watch the coverage I want to see when I want to see without waiting for the Weather Channel to cover my local area.
B006P0FD4W|5.0|Bought this dvd for my uncle who loves these movies. This movie is really creepy! If you liked the first and second paranormal activity movies then you will like this one too!
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|First book I have read by Picoult.  A friend loves her writings, so I decided to read her. this book was intriguing and heartwrenching. I couldn't stop reading! Enjoyed very much!

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a GREAT product.It is very easy to use, the size is perfect and you can use is it in a dark room without turning on the light.
B00957T6X6|5.0|one of the true fantasy classics of our era ; Martin deserves the highest praise for his books.  I only wish I had read them sooner!
B0006PV5VC|5.0|This was an piece my parents listened to when I was a child, and a month or so before Christmas, I missed it in my own collection for the first time.  I still don't know how I managed to arrive at adulthood without a version of this sensual delight.
B004X2M9VY|5.0|I know that I'm just a drop in the bucket as far as fans go to this series but I do believe that Matt Smith and crew are truly getting better.  find myself waiting for the next season.<br /><br />Thank you for all of the fun.
B0091LS07E|5.0|fast shipment enjoy the CD Thanks... Will order and again in the fortune looking to check some movies on the site
B00915G6WQ|3.0|while theres's multible plot twists im a lil dissapointed with this season..me being a huge fan of season 2 i felt like this season was a lotta filler but i hear theres word that there gonna keep going after season 8 which would be pretty awesome we'll see how. it goes .......i hope the series ends a particular way but im not a writer for the show so what can ya do but hope anyways if ur a big dexter fan like me get it if your not ya gotta start at the beginning and if you dont like dexter........then...\\"get on the table\\"
B003V5CFV8|5.0|Great music and great fun. Must see. Cohen brothers have a real talent for getting the feel of an area of our country(e.g.Fargo) and they hit the nail on the head with this southern piece.

B00127RAJY|3.0|I am finally motivated to lose weight and i was really feeling the burn on this DVD but it stopped working, in the middle which is really disappointing, I want to return and get another one but have no clue on how to. Help?
B001PO53IO|5.0|I love the two to three episode story arcs they have going with this show. Interesting how gritty the show can get considering its development had young children in mind.
B00899F0G8|5.0|I get completely involved and love it. I love the characters, the story line, the mystery. All of it. Its not like many other shows where you can predict everything that will happen.
B004TI5N38|4.0|Along with Zero Day, an exciting thriller. The twists and turns kept me trying to figure out &#34;who dunnit&#34;. Recommended
B00B2V66VS|5.0|its very funny and awesome. recommend for all to pass time and have a lot of adventure. good game. :) (y)
B0013F1D02|5.0|This is a fun family movie that everyone can watch.(10 and up) Love, honor, pride and determination, defeat evil and overcome the ages of disparity. Fantasy with a bit whimsy, magic, fighting and fun along the way.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Addicting.  This game is so fun.  But be careful.  Once you get into it, it's hard to put it down. Better than Temple Run 1.
B00095NX9G|5.0|Excellent dvd. The yoga part of the dvd is reason to buy it. Rachel goes in detail and explain posture, technique, and the combinations of the two choreographies she perform. A lot of hours to learn from Rachel in the two dvd. You should buy this dvd
0765325950|1.0|The prior 13 volume had a depth to the characters that gave them life and made the pages live!  In Memory of Light all of the other characters were suddenly reduced to a depth of a Harlequin Romance character, and the pages simply processed wood pulp.<br /><br />Rands participation is 90% fantasies (BBOORRIINNGG) and there are an endless number of battle sequences.  How many ways can you kill a Trolloc, or vice virca?  Evidently almost 800 pages worth.  After 5 or 10 battle sequences you started to skim to the next meaningful story point.  After the 15th or 20th, you started to wonder when this stupid book would end.<br /><br />Every channeler is using The Power at full strength for days on end with, for the most part, little consequence except fatigue.  In all prior volumes before using it at this level would have burned every channeler out on the first day.  3 or 4 characters that had significant parts in one or more of the prior volumes ended up with only a few paragraphs, maybe a couple pages.  Key parts of The Prophecy of The Dragon, obsessed over in earlier volumes, ended up with a short sentence here and there, or were quickly stuck in in the last part of the last chapter.<br /><br />I have read every book in WOT at least once every year since publication, re-reading each one before diving into the newest,  MOL, unfortunately, is not a book worth reading again.  Which makes me wonder if it may have killed my desire to re-read the first 13, which were beyond excellent?<br /><br />The first two WOT volumes Brandon Sanderson ghost authored were excellent continuations of Robert Jordan's WOT epic, difficult to differentiate from The first 11 volumes. I don't know if  there were fewer notes from Mr Jordan, Mr Sanderson was ill, or if the editors had interns - nay, their 5th cousins, twice removed - edit the book.  Whatever the case, MOL was hardly worth the paper in was printed on and, sadly, all would have been better served if they had simply never published this WOT conclusion.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This book is a page turner that holds your interests from cover to cover.  Both men and women will like it!
B00B2V66VS|1.0|Do not download this app for kindle fire if you close out of the app and re open it will just close out after aproxmately 6 seconds.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Very easy to use and follow. It's also what my church uses so that's nice too. Real life plans to follow.
B009HELT3C|5.0|It's a nice escapist movie.  Very clever and entertaining and an enjoyable way to spend the evening.  Not quite as good as I but much better than II
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Season 2, like Season 1, was absolutely OUTSTANDING!  I'm starting Season 3 and it is certainly on the same track.  Loved it!!
B00AYB20KI|3.0|Remembered the previews on tv and since my cable went out, figured why not watch this! Kind of choppy in beginning the and the characters past is not well explained. You figure it out, but shouldn't have had to. Good twist in the end, but questions are left unanswered. All in all, good rainy day movie, but I wouldn't pu tit at the top of your list.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|I love it but after u die you have to back to the beginning and do it sting. don't get me wrong it is fun and u would over it like I do. I think u should deside if u want to get it or not I'm not really trying to convince u to get it.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I am reading this book now and I can hardly put it down-really interesting.  But knowing Child he will get my favorite person<br />out of trouble and clean out this messed up town.
B0084I9QI2|5.0|They alone make this purchase worth it. The Bad DVD is wonderful. With it was bluray, if only for the better sound.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|residents at the nursing home really love this game. helps their thinking and also focus. To bad it doesn't have any music to it. this is a game for all ages.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I love this app! I can't put it down...I'm not much of a &#34;game player&#34; but I love this.  I do have to put it down now and again to rest my eyes.  It's great for when you're waiting in the doctor's office or elsewhere and you don't feel like reading.
B004SIIBGU|4.0|This app comes in handy for using ebay on my Kindle Fire HD. A must have if you are going to do some betting.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|kept me wanting more.. Love writings that I can 'see'..so now I'm reading the second book of the trilogy!Look forward to the third book!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Addictive game. I keep playing, trying to beat the computer one more time. It is easy to move the cards just by tapping, so my fingers do not get tired. Love it.
B007THA4FI|3.0|Guess that I was expecting the prose of &#34;Harry Potter&#34;.  This book is dry and very difficult to get into.  I have not finished it because it has not &#34;hooked&#34; me.
B007N8RULO|5.0|My husband loves this game and plays every day. Easy to use and understand. A must have in the game department.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|it's cool you can take a lot of different cool picture and you can decorate it you should get it's awsome
B00ARN0XGG|4.0|Stand alone the movie would get 2 stars. But since it is a continued story I have 4 stars for the series perspective.<br /><br />It is what it is. 93 minutes of entertainment you don't need to rewatch but weren't mad you spent the time on it.
B00A81MV3U|5.0|The film centers around Patrick (Bradley Cooper), a bipolar person, who has issues. He goes into a berserk mode whenever he hears \\"My Cherie Amour\\" like Curly used to do when they played \\"Pop Goes the Weasel.\\" Of course bipolar people should be introduced to other bipolar people, because you never sleep with anyone crazier than yourself.<br /><br />Patrick is introduced to Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence) who steals every scene with an Oscar worthy performance. Robert De Niro plays Patrick's father, a superstitious Eagles fan, who appears to be slightly bipolar himself. While institutionalized, Patrick learned to look for \\"the silver lining\\" in everything in order to cope with life, something he doesn't always do too well. Tiffany has her own issues and together they haphazardly work their way into a relationship.<br /><br />They should film more movies in Philadelphia as I have never seen the streets so clean. It is a heart warming, fun drama/romance with an indie flavor. Worth a view, but not necessarily on the big screen.<br /><br />Parental Guidance: F-bombs, no sex, brief nudity.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I love this game I have it on my moms phone and it is real additive I love it I think young should get it.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|A sufficient story. Easy to read and enjoyable though somewhat predictable. I was specifically looking for a romance and it delivered. Will certainly purchase the author again and already have...lol.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|If you are a John Corey fan, thanks to author Nelson DeMille, you'll enjoy this novel for the story, the wit and suspense. I can't wait for the next installment.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's about time there was a good horse based game app!<br />There are a few things that could be better, like having tack available that matches the English based competitions.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Very well written, an interesting view into the lives of two members of the Greatest Generation during and after the war.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book made me laugh and cry at the same time.  No book has done that to me before. read it
B009VB7P6G|4.0|Things I liked-  more realistic bodies (spring ferry has fecund, plush thighs), no &#34;bad guys&#34;, good for sensitive children. Music was a bit bland.  Not a very good plot but fine for kids.
1451629192|5.0|Very well written. Love all the information.Love the cover.Great.Love how she looks at life.Get a box of tissue ready when you read.
B00A9C3RB8|3.0|Only had a few good spots.....just an ok movie..don't think that I would see this one again but now that is all I have to say...
B00AIQP9DE|3.0|Should let you know only a portion is free, the free part is more like a demo.  Graphics are good, puzzles are fun.
B00AEFVRB2|1.0|never seems to amaze me how so much effort and money can be spent on d grade movies?<br />I continued watching, but there always was a big urge to turn it off.<br />The characters were average, the story line was as thin as paper and the finale was laughable...really<br />I suppose actors do get paid?
B005CVWWJY|5.0|I grew up in the late Seventies and early Eighties, and really enjoyed this book.  The various references to Dungeons & Dragons, and early console and video games brought back a lot of memories...and yes, I suppose I was a bit of a geek.  Cleverly written with an interesting &#34;matrix like&#34; storyline...top stuff.
B007EECSFA|3.0|Very clever storytelling. A back and forth plot both confusing and intriguing. I am glad that I stuck with it.  There is so much more to the story  lots for the reader to reflect on.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|It was a very good book. It kept me turning the page from beginning to end. I finished the book and only wanted more. I had to buy book 3
B000I0QL82|5.0|This is my favorite Adult Christmas movie.  I have watched it twice since I received it.  I even watched the bonus features, which is something I don't usually do.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I had to uninstall it one time and reinstall it wouldent come up it would go to the home screen.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Great app, very easy to use and even easier to read. For a free app, this is well done and makes me wish there were more free apps as good as this one.
B009ZZDNT6|3.0|ITS OKAY JUST DOWNLOADED APP IF you want to wake up if you sleep sound you might need the bullhorn alarm
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Well written given the target.  HDTV hornet mihbigb kick much ,n,our hrs njdnugvbnju NFC NBC byt not ntf my nut
B0055B7K7A|5.0|very good. very good. very good.<br />5 stars. 5 stars. 5 stars.<br />great. great. great.<br /><br />The movie is very good.
B006OB3K56|5.0|Just bought this the other day and viewed it last night for the first time. I must say I was shocked on how powerful the performances and the storyline were. Yes the film is rated NC-17 for sexual content. But that shouldn't sway you away from viewing this incredible story about addiction and trying to come to terms with it. This was in my opinion one of the top five films of 2011. I can't wait for the next Fassbender/Mcqueen collaboration. The Hunger and Shame were both very exceptional pieces of filmmaking.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|This is probably the game that gets the most use on my phone. The gameplay is really unique & challenging, and there is something oddly addicting about trying to conquer the world with a plague. I've played through 20+ games now and I'm still having fun.<br /><br />Easily worth a dollar if you're a fan of strategy games at all.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Better than the first and I LOVE the first one! I can see a lot more of my time spent on this one!
B00170F0WU|5.0|very good. very good. very good.<br />5 stars. 5 stars. 5 stars.<br />great. great. great.<br /><br />The movie is very good.
B00A8KJN14|4.0|A sweet little film by Burton and a love letter to classic horror movies. It's a real shame that this film wasn't a big hit in the U.S.. We need more films like this. Stop-motion animation is definitely becoming a dead art and that just shouldn't be the case.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Great game that translates really well to mobile devices. Looks and sounds just like the PC version on my tablet. Highly recommended if you enjoy light strategy games.
030758836X|1.0|I have never gone from loving, to hating, a book so fast and so intensely.  The beginning is an interesting study of a marriage going wrong.  I thought the author had wonderful insights into marriage.  Then the book changes and turns into a wallow in everything that is wrong with modern entertainment.  What is our societies fascination with psychopaths?  It seems like today's writers (tv, movie, and print) think the only way we can hold someone's interest is to maim, sexually assault, or murder someone. Unfortunately, the victims are so often women.  This book takes that on that theme, with a slightly different twist, but no less demeaning to women or disturbing.  It feels like the book is written by two different people.  The first author, takes a sympathetic look at two people in a strained relationship.  The second author, feels a misogynistic shock jock. I kept reading because, as other commenters have indicated, I kept waiting for justice.  Now I feel traumatized.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|The RACKETEER- Great plot, interesting characters and fast paced.  Grisham is the best story teller. Worth the read for sure
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great game very realistic and lots of fun!!! Lots of levels and fun things to do with your horse. I love it
859037985X|5.0|I have all the Lua books dating back lua 5.0,  I highly recommend this one. The author, Roberto(Lua's primary developer), is active daily on the mailing list as well to answer questions regarding the book and Lua in general.
B00785P2QC|4.0|this is a great little game that has a lot of content, good fun and easy to pick up, quite addictive too.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Just as good as Girl Gone.  Would recommend this book.  It is a page turner. Plan to read more by this author.
B00B2EWNWG|1.0|I will make this short. The Man with the Iron Fists is in the top 3 worst martial arts movies ever made!! Bad acting + a horrible story = KUNG POO!!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I would give this double the stars. I love it. I use it everyday for bible readings and devotionals. I use in church so I can find the scriptures easy when the pastor gives them out. If he goes to different ones I can follow. I would HIGHLY RECOMMENED THIS APP !!!!!!
0307165485|5.0|This is such a nice collection of stories. All kids can find something in here they are interested in. Great for a long car or plane ride!
B005I6EVUG|5.0|I love the collor and design of case and the case does a good job protecting the kindle. I can easily carry it in my purse.
B00AF46Q5Y|4.0|I am speed reading these books because it still seems like there is a lot of repetition and extra stuff that doesn't matter.  While in the first one, I was okay with the stereotypical characters (good/poor, evil/rich) in this one it got a little hokey.  Don't get me wrong, I still enjoyed it because I am immersed in the story and what will happen next in the plot.  Unfortunately, this is truly an episode in the series and ends with a cliffhanger.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Lop it's so cool to play so I am playing this game every day. So you should play it too. Be cool and play.
B002Q1YDLI|5.0|I've read this 5 times now and still love it, which I think is the biggest compliment you can give a book.
B00AKOB7CG|4.0|Love the convience of the worksouts. Need to use it more with a busy schedule. Life is busy and the convience is helpful
B004LP3AYI|4.0|I enjoyed the story, and whisperync,  but found the narrator stiff and monotone.  This was my first whispering experience and I loved it!
B0089AD8IO|5.0|This was a gift for my daughter.  She was very happy with product.  Spend the holiday catching up on Doctor Who.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|It was great and I loved the movie too. I would recommend both to anyone. Loved Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I only played temple run once in a while but then once I downloaded temple run 2 I loved it. I couldn't put down my tablet (Kindle Fire which is also amazing:)
B00AMSLRAC|4.0|my 3 year old daughter really likes this game.  I am not sure if she is learning about growing though.
B008XBHIEY|5.0|Brother Les played a part in it.  Was pissed when I was late to work because they closed the road during the filming of the &#34;pond&#34; scene.  Also pissed that my brother took the part and made me work instead.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|very fun game realistic animation love the horse choices the outfits are cute and the training for the events is fun
B001NLKT60|5.0|Difficult to put down...  Plan a lot of free time when you start the trilogy. Perfect to take on a quiet vacation
B003MC5N28|4.0|Fast read, interesting concept. Good book for book club discussions. Our book club was able to get into a heated discussion about the book.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|It was very good. A nice twist at the end. John Corey's humour was great throughout. I liked it very much.
B007HACDLK|4.0|Muy bien escrito, entretenido, bien investigado, excelente para una lectura con ganas de espionaje, política y aventura! Muy bien gastado mi dinero.
B000N2HCM4|4.0|....if ever you want to understand the frame of reference of a great man......what an opportunity to get an insight into his values and experience....he is unique, beyond bright, intuitive....this book shows you why....sometimes I cried...was deeply moved....
B00A2LOAKI|5.0|Hello,<br /><br />Great movie, but I have a question for all the buyers here, is the bluray \\"all region\\" like part one was? becaus if its only region A it s*cks cause I'm in France...<br /><br />thanks for your answers!<br /><br />grouss
B00AFCEIB0|3.0|I find the product. To many categories to pick from. I just wanted an App that would take me straight to Google Search. Didn't want to have to choose a category once the App came up. I really don't like it.
B004SRNH10|3.0|I didn't use this product.  So I can only say that it is okay.  I ended up deleted this app. only because it wasn't what I needed.
B004LWZWGK|4.0|I was not happy that the digital copy was different.  You need to be online to veiw the movie.  I was hoping it would just load on my Ipad, that only happens if I have wiFi hook up.
B001GUXJQA|5.0|Enjoyed<br />VERY suspenseful  five star.  Kept me wanting more  from a world far from my own. Gives me some hope for true respect for the officers who deal with this life and  continue  on for all  of us but for the right reasons.
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|Totally Addicted to this series. It's a must watch. I can't wait until the next episode airs next week! :)
B00A2FSXHK|4.0|Tom Cruise does solid films as eccentric as he is.  The concept of the film is interesting and the acting well done.  The film as a whole had an emptiness to it though.
B00APUQH0W|4.0|Quality acting with a decent story,  Hard not to like.  Worth your time and good for family viewing.  Rent it.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I thoroughly enjoy this series.  It has many ups and downs, but I like that<br />there aren't interuptions for commercials.
B0097C8XL0|5.0|it's addicting! Just try to play 1 time, double dare you. We need more games like this, fun and helps hand eye coordination
B00632HWOG|5.0|I do not like the updated online version of Yahoo, but the updated android version is awesome. It is just as useful as the online site.
B0094K1WZE|1.0|This movie could not keep my mind engaged, so the action becomes meaningless.<br />Cerebral juices lulled.  Most movies keep me awake ... i fell sleep.
B008CPZNL6|5.0|I love Flipboard...especially on the 8.9&#34; Kindle Fire. All of my social network updates and news feeds sewn together into a stunning, flippable digital &#34;magazine&#34;? Hell yes.
0385535147|5.0|I also bought this book for my husband and he said it was one of Grisham's best ever. I can't wait to read it myself.
B008LY9AWG|4.0|I would categorize these stories  as written in the noir fashion. All of them are a great read that hold your attention. Definitely worth the time and money
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The book was tragic, heartwarming, and tear-inducing at the same time!! It was one of the best books I have ever read since Harry Potter!
B0088P2A7A|5.0|Great app for fans of the original website. There are a lot of Wiki apps out there that transcribe the info from Wikipedia, but this app IS Wikipedia.
B00785P2QC|5.0|ich finde es super toller Zeitvertreib Macht immer spass aber aufgepasst es ist ein großer suchtfaktor dabei zumindest bei mir.
0425264351|2.0|Came back to this one having read half a dozen other Reacher novels. So obviously I like them. This strikes me as being the same plot as all the others with slightly different names. I know that if it ain't broke, dont change it but I think Childs needs a fresh frame work.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Book is quite good, wasnt expecting it to be as good as it is. really enjoying it, read through in about 3 days
B00AMBLDEE|4.0|I'm sure most people already know, but Jeremy Renner is NOT playing Jason Bourne. This is not a typical reboot, but more of a story-continuing character reboot. Set after the events of the Matt Damon movies, Renner's character is a product of a similar government experiment at creating perfect soldiers that doesn't go exactly as planned. Glorious shoot-outs and butt kicking ensue. An enjoyable watch.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is by far the best book I have read in a while. It had some twists that I didn't see coming plus a love story that stood the test of time and guilt. Read it! Perfect book for a cold, rainy Sunday afternoon!!
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|First of all, I have to say that Colleen Hoover is an exceptional author. I've read so many books where I just could not care less what happens to the characters, whether or not they fall in love, or if end up together in the end, but Hoover's character are so REAL. That being said, I really did enjoy the story. Although I have never met a high school boy with the maturity level and vocabulary that Holder had (and let's be honest, no adult really wants to read a book about two high schoolers with the ACTUAL maturity level of two high schoolers...) I loved his and Sky's chemistry. I only wish there hadn't been so MUCH chemistry. Call me straight-laced, but I believe there is something fundamentally and MORALLY wrong about two kids talking about birth control and having such active sex lives. It's a very unfortunate message to send to all the young people reading this book (ok ANYONE reading this book)that sex is just something expected once you pass the age of 15! SO while I really did love the story and all the character development and change that Sky Holder go through, I honestly think that their love and relationship would have been sweeter without all the sex. I don't believe it made their feelings or connection seem anymore real or intense in the slightest. In fact it was the one think I really hated about the relationship and made it seem more forced to me.  This is why I can only give it 3 stars. Again, I really do love this author and Slammed and Point of Retreat were incredible books. I was just disappointed  with this book's lack of morals and horrible example...
B004LWZWGK|4.0|Not much into superheros and fiction? This is happy medium of both. Not too unbelievable and not too zany. I was a instant fan of the series upon wanting Batman Begins. The Dark Knight is still probably my favorite of the three movies however this is not very far behind. I strongly recommend this movie to anyone that has 2.5 hours of free time. Great cinematography, excellent eye-candy (and not just Cat Woman either! /whistle) , and great sound track.
B0094MAZKK|5.0|Didn't know a thing about this when my brother recommended it to me, but gave it a shot. Very intriguing plot about a SWAT like unit attempting to infiltrate a crime syndicate controlled high-rise building...which sets up a very nice backdrop for some extreme action and very cool fighting scenes.
B000095K7A|5.0|on vinyl.  The Postal Service included so much more with the vinyl release of their album.  Bonuses included a 2-sided album art poster, B-sides and remixes and a booklet.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Being that we are a family of railroad workers, I thought it would be fun for my 6 year old grandson to play this game.  The graphics are awesome and he had no problem figuring out what to do.
B00ATDOVNK|3.0|Some things were fairly easy i loved the story plot. More to come??? Please keep me posted for brand new game like this
B009X01C64|5.0|After purchasing the new Kindle Fire HD (8.9&#34; version) I set about finding a nice case for it. I was already familiar with Marware, having purchased a case for the original Fire from them. This one was a no-brainer. Attractive leather exterior, protective felt interior and the ability to rotate the screen from landscape to portrait views while standing the unit up? Awesome.
B000AHJJDM|5.0|This one is my favorite DCfC album.  Rarely is there an album by an artiist wherein each song is amazing and there isn't a single song to dislike.  This is one such album.every single song is one to be cherished and listened to over and over again.  The best track however, in my opinion, is I Will Follow You into the Dark.  It is such a powerfully emotional song.  The lyrics are beautiful.  The melody is beautiful.  His vocals are beautiful.  He typically performs this acoustic in concert.  If you've ever experienced loss of a loved one you will deeply feel this track.  I had the last verse tattooed for my father after he passed.<br /><br />If you only own on Death Cab album, make it this one.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|great graphics; variety of puzzles. has hint button which needed to solve some puzzles. kept me interested and sometimes scary. worth the cost and would do sequel.
B00APUYWYA|3.0|With such an all-star cast of recognized actresses, I though the story would be clever and funny. Turns out it was just funny, but it tried too hard at even that.
B007FRHZ4A|1.0|This seems like it would be a fun game...but the little plastic bubble that the pig goes in, doesn't stay shut...so you really can't play the game.<br />Waste of my money!
B005RUUUAI|4.0|Good Sci-Fi. Worth your time and keeps your attention for the most part. Always curious to see whats coming next.
0802473164|5.0|I love this book!  I've shared it with several friends and relatives who have all enjoyed it.  This is applicable to all relationships (not just romantic ones).  I don't know exactly how much the \\"male\\" version varies from the original but I've shared this particular book with couples who did not seem to notice a difference.  They are both fairly androgynous.  My boyfriend and I read this book over a year a go when we were still dating.  It gave us dialogue we needed to express our abstract thoughts and feelings.  His commitment to reading this book while reflecting over it together wooed me.  Till this day he asks me \\"how is your love tank?\\".  Definitely full!
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I love it when you need it will be there<br /><br />I love it when you need it is there for you
B007VUA7VO|1.0|This app will give you info on the battery but will drain it faster than anything else...do not download for kindle fire
B009FZHYKU|4.0|Good Sci-Fi. Worth your time and keeps your attention for the most part. Always curious to see whats coming next.
B0019BI1FA|5.0|It was always amazing, back in the days when this collection was aired on PBS, to see how deep the revervoir of English acting talent went.  Each one of these production is a 'gem', with fairly good production values, video, sound and direction.  It such a pleasure to hear the language (with all the nuances at Oscar Wilde's disposal) spoken so beautifully.  The humor is sly, the drama is high and the enjoyment is endless.  Hightly recommended.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|Great protection for the kindle fire HD7. I can carry it anywhere with out worrying about it getting damaged or. turning on without my knowledge
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|After reading this book, Colleen Hoover has become my new favorite author. Once you start, you can't put the book down! Such an incredible story. Loved every second of it!
B00AE2J5HI|4.0|Great storyline, great acting, dragged at times but eventually would start moving again. Would recommend and watch again. Rent it.
B007L96SI6|3.0|This album was OK! for her first but I was hoping for a different style from Haley. Haley does great with jazzy, bluesy music especially with Case Abrams.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Always love his books.this book had twists and turns and made me root for underdog  smart  haven't read another like it
B008AK8FHM|5.0|The author really tried to look at all possible answers to his voyage.  But it came down to the truth...his voyage to heaven and back and the peace and love he felt.  Renewed my faith in heaven.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Really enjoyed the film and it brought tears, laughter and drama all wrapped into one great story about family relationships.
B004HXIZVC|5.0|I'm really glad I there's a soundcloud app for Kindle. Now I can really enjoy everything with one device! Thanks!
B009MF5BXK|4.0|Loved the first one that can out  saw at theaters and wanted to purchase  lots of action  mayb liked first one better but still a good buy
B005804NCI|2.0|On the positive side, the sound of this pressing IS more transparent and open than that of the 2004 domestic remaster. The treble is also more extended. HOWEVER, the '04 version has vastly superior bass and dynamics and will remain my reference for this album. To put it simply, the SACD just doesn't rock. What's more, two songs on the Japanese disc feature different mixes from the American version. \\"Never Going Back Again\\" doesn't include the famous plucked open string shortly after the first chorus (people who know and love \\"Rumours\\" know exactly what I'm talking about). And, \\"Gold Dust Woman\\" begins at full volume instead of fading in. This disc did solve a mystery for me, though. I recently downloaded \\"Rumours\\" in 24/96 resolution from HDtracks and received the mixes on the Japanese album. At least now I know where they came from.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I prefer happier books after this one.  Love the character and definitely something I can't relate, fortunately. I feel blessed to be healthy.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Because of the movie coming out and just receiving a Kindle for Christmas I figured I would get the first book. Loved it so much that I turned around and bought the second one. As soon as I'm done I will be getting the next one and the next and the next...
B0063GORYU|4.0|This version of the classic Solitaire will keep your mind alert.  Success depends on thinking several moves ahead. I like the challenge.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple run 2 is a great second version of temple run 1 ! it is really fun and easy! 5 stars!!!
B0002OXVDW|5.0|This collection bring my dad's memories back...he really love it and me too!<br />Nice packaging and very good quality. ;)
B005KELQEU|5.0|Bought this for my Kindle that I had received for Christmas. Just the right size to fit in my purse for when ever I get an opportunity to read.
1849904251|5.0|I simply had to have this when I saw it was a tie-in book with my favorite TV series of all time. It was everything I could hope for. 'Reproductions' of John's case notes including the post it note arguments between Sherlock and John are interspersed with articles about the series and Sherlock Holmes in literature and media. A great read and one I will re-read for years to come.
B0065GC0BA|5.0|Beautiful, heartwrenching and hallarious at the same time. A real page turner! It changed the way I see the world from a quadroplegig's point of view.
B007PBKG5G|5.0|Awesome band - so refreshing to hear something unique in today's music scene.  I highly recommend this to any classic rock, folk, rock, soul, or country fan, or just about anyone who wants to hear a great band.  Disappointed that I missed my chance to see them in Baltimore a few months back, but I can't wait till they come around again!
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|I love it!!!! Great show, fun to watch, well acted and filmed.  If you want to have a good time watch this show!!
B0034DGPEU|5.0|It is not often that I read a story that affects me as much as The Kitchen House.  The story is so rich in characters and thought provoking with each page.  Lavinia is orphaned on a ship from Ireland and ends up bought as a servant.  Her transformation from a seriously traumatized child to a young woman who learns the importance of morals and values from the slaves that opened what little they had to her....  this book will stay with me for awhile.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|The book was very intriguing, sans all of the sex scenes. It captured my attention and held it, which is hard and rare for a book and I immediately purchased books 2 & 3 to find out what was going to happen next!  The sex scenes became distracting, because they seemed to be repetitive and the author was stuck on certain phrases, which he repeated over and over in all three books! Can someone say Thesaurus?
B004QKNXIQ|1.0|i rented movie because my grandkids just love this movie. but they were disappointed cause it will not show on my computer on the first day of rental when my grandkids were there and then the next day it was showing when they were gone. i will not be renting any more dvds.
B004N622EY|4.0|I liked the book, was looking for something to read and start a new series. had only read Brandons contribution to the Wheel of time series, so thought I would give this series a go.
B00A6TYCNQ|4.0|I think the app is alright because sometimes it has random glitches.My screen will go black and have to do soft reset. The combats good though
B002RI9HUM|4.0|loved this book, really like Marian Keyes for holiday relaxing reading. Sh tells a great story and I particulary like the family characters
B00992CF6W|5.0|My boys play this all if the time. They have a creative mode where they can build whatever they want with no time limit. Good app :)
B003XNTTYY|4.0|A good read, interesting story and like the progression and growth of all the characters. Now committed to reading the entire series.
B0048KXRR6|3.0|Very heavy British language with some slurred speaking.  No closed captioning made it a difficult story to follow verbally.  Having watched the first Nanny movie, one could follow the idea OK.
B007KOYEOC|5.0|Read all three books on my kindle and can I say I enjoyed it? bit boring in the 2nd book (and predictable) but I liked the ending.
B0058YPGSY|5.0|Love this series.  I don't have HBO so buying it after the season is complete.  I will continue to buy as long as the series continues.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Enjoyable read, real page turner. You must have a pretty high freak level to really image and feel the characters in this book. On my way to the next book Fifty Shades  Darker.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Really fun game with difficult puzzles and great graphics!  I can't wait for the sequel!  Well developed storyline that makes you think the game is over but you're actually wing led into a brand new area of the game.
0765325950|2.0|I concur this was a ghastly conclusion to the WOT series.  Why were the characters so off?  What the heck happened to the well developed and interesting history developed for the central players.  Sigh... my guess is that there were fewer notes that we the readers fantasized about and what we read over the last two books was Sanderson derived extrapolation.  Presumptively, ridiculously endless battles with thousands of never-ending Trollocs and a number of story line premises that quite frankly were non-applicable or even offensive to any reader of the WOT series, What the Heck!!! This book seems to be a work constructed in hast because of back pressure from publishers and readers alike.<br /><br />I do not blame Mr. Sanderson I lament the passing of Mr. Jordan.<br /><br />Good job Mr. Sanderson in trying to fill the gap but I have to agree with other readers who have presented reviews that perhaps it's better for us to dwell and reflect the possibilities only upon the books completed by Mr. Jordan.
B009NPKTN6|1.0|Nice try for the return of the musical...but this movie was more irritating than anything else. I wanted to like it, I'm a rock fan, but the characters couldn't pull it off.
B006MHWXMS|4.0|I have used this app for a while now. I like the ability to have different lists and have a master tab to see all items at once. One thing I don't like is when checking off multiple items the sync can make checking off the right item a bit of a challenge. I just have to slow down a bit.
B00003CXB4|5.0|Good condition for used item. It was a gift for someone and they loved it.  Besides its hard to find this movie on dvd anywhere.  Great movie and love watching it with the kids.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Great book. Kept waiting at the end for Sparks' sad, heartbreaking ending but was pleasantly surprised! Can't wait to see the movie.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|The book was good, but you are really left with the feeling there is more to come, not sure when that will be but anytime will be most welcome :-)
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I read all of Grisham's novels. I wouldn't says this is the best one but I love how he can tell a story. Highly recommend this book. It is an easy read.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I know there have been mixed reviews regarding this book but I think it was fantastic. Definitely a tear jerker!!
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Haven't finished the whole thing yet, but it is incredibly written and a great read for anyone that loves the show it is filled with detail that puts things in a different perspective then the show.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Makes me wonder what the future really holds, I know it does not end there, the author gets you invested in their lives that is so great
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Interesting game with story, hidden objects, and logic puzzles. The game is not too hard and fun to play. Hope you have a good time with it.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It is a good book but it could be longer<br />Jeff Kinney is awesome at writing books. Buy this now
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love the new scenary and obstacles....never a dull moment. so much fun.....I could play for hours if I didn't have so many daily chores.
B0095R76EW|4.0|I'm a fan of the Judd Apatow crew but I didn't feel like watching a rom-com this night. I said, let's watch the trailer, if I laugh at all during it, we can watch it.  Unfortunately, I laughed at something. The movie was pretty good though and by the end of it, I was content with the purchase.
B004IFYN2E|5.0|Both Jolie and Depp did a wonderful job with their characters.<br /><br />The movie had drama, romance and comedy.  How can you go wrong with a movie like that!?
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a great tool to have that you can always keep with you! You can read or listen to all different versions of the Bible when ever you chose to. I really enjoy listening to the Bible and it helps me sleep at night. Thanks Bible Gateway!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|App works fine and of course fun. All levels work fine except for one which says it coming soon. Plenty to do in the mean time.
B004SUWR2C|4.0|Chose this game because I like to play cards and like to play this game with friends  It is a little different from the card came
B004SUDPWI|5.0|This is like Shawshank Redemption in that it never gets old.<br /><br />Actors, story line and setting are outstanding.  And the whistle song - love it!<br /><br />Timeless classic.
B0053TMP24|5.0|After reading The Lost Hero, i couldn't wait to read this book. While at first i was a bit sadden that Jason, Leo, and Piper wasn't really in this book, but Frank, Hazel, and Percy were all characters i liked.<br />I'm not much of a reader, but once i started reading i couldn't put it down! Any free time i got i was mostly all over the book. There was enough action, the pacing i thought was good.<br /><br />I recommend this book to everyone.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|It has all kinds of options for your daily reading and has bookmarks. And it has multiple versions to choose from.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Enjoyed this book a lot!  It kept me curious as to where Jews  going with all the twists and turns!
B00AG6Z92C|3.0|I have many Andrea's CD's and never ever get tired listening to them. Who's idea was to have him sing simple standards, showing that he can sing these songs. Its like letting a college math professor count till 10, LOL. In fact I know many of these songs and they are done much better than Andrea, even with voices not as good as Andrea. This is my personal opinion, cheers! P.S. The CD Amore 2006, has much better song selection, that shows his fantastic voice in full power, without going into an opera, love this CD!
B003TSEL7S|5.0|This was my first book(college textbooks don't count!! ;( ) that i have read front and back in let's say give or take 10 years? Once i started reading my god i couldn't put this down. This was my first book from Rick Riordan, and i love it. The pacing great, the action awesome, the integration of Greek/Roman mythology is fantastic. The way Riordan merged it with modern society is perfect.
B008MM9630|5.0|This is a ideally good game.. I didn't think I would like it. But I do good graphics and its really fun..!!!
B00B2V66VS|1.0|When I started the game I loved it couldn't stop playing it. A few hours later when I try to open the app it shuts down and will not let me play...sucks
B009UWYFFK|5.0|I'M WATCHING THE MOVIE AS I WRITE THIS AND LOVE IT! I CAN'T WAIT TO GET THE BLU RAY WHEN THE PRICE GOES DOWN. I LOVE MONSTERS AND THEY DID GREAT WITH THIS ONE! LOVE LOVE LOVE IT! WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND!
B0052RDHTM|5.0|learning about the  first world war proved to be not only interesting ,but also  a  great background to understand why we had also a second world war.<br /> The author thru its many protagonist from several different countries moves the story along in a very entertaining manner.Looking forward to read the next book<br />The architect
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is amazing. And to find out i can play it in my kindle is a miracle. I love minecraft on pc and pocket edition if amazing! I think it worth every penny. I highly recommended this for minecraft fans and non minecraft fans. Its a great start if you've never played pc minecraft, but even for minecraft pc fans. But for all who are complaining that this is to unupdated, STOP it. this game is still under develpment and it turning out great. I can't wait for all the new updates that are coming. Even for the early version of minecraft it still supports many features, and it has zombies, skeleton, spiders, and creepers.<br /><br />A big thanks to the developers. Your doing a great job.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Easy entertaining, many times a sad read. I would read something by this author again. I need five more words to post this.
B009AMALLM|5.0|JUST WATCHED THIS ABOUT AN HOUR AGO! I LOVE IT! THEY JUST KEEP GETTING CREEPIER AND CREEPIER. I WAS THINKING IN THE BEGINNING THE LITTLE BOY ROBBIE ACROSS THE STREET WITH KATIE WAS ACTUALLY HUNTER THAT SHE STOLE AWAY IN THE SECOND ONE. THEN TO FIND OUT WYATT IS ADOPTED AND HE IS HUNTER. I HOPE THEY DO MAKE THE 5TH ONE AND EXPLAIN THAT PART OF IT. I LOVED EVERYTHING ELSE! DON'T KNOW WHY IT GOT SUCH BAD REVIEWS BUT I LOVED IT. EVERYONE HAS THEIR OWN OPINION. I PLAN ON BUYING IT AS WELL WHEN THE PRICE GOES DOWN. IF YOU LOVED THE MOVIES AND LOVE SCARY STUFF DON'T MISS OUT ON WATCHING THIS.. DECIDE FOR YOURSELF! I WASN'T DISAPPOINTED.. A LITTLE CONFUSED BUT STILL :)
B00846REIS|5.0|I love this series and ordered the second book before even finishing this one.  I have reread the two books out so far 3 times!  Very intense, passionate romance.  Great characters.  I highly recommend it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app soooooo much it is so fun and I can't wait to show my other friends how to play it!
B001N1DPDE|5.0|Heavy duty 1/4 &#34; thick steel. Full tang. Great for chopping, digging, batoning, you name it this knife will handle it!<br />Ethan Becker and Ka-Bar are a great partnership!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|most of the times I click on the app it always click on it always start and then automatic ly closes
B00003CXTG|4.0|Like Titanic, don't watch Pearl Harbor as a historical documentary. If you watch it to enjoy a great film wrapped around a historical event this one will be for you. Are you a Michael Bay fan? If not, you're not going to like it. Count on all the Michael Bay movie tricks, the 360, beautiful ladies, male bravado....but I love all that stuff. To claim this movie doesn't have soul or depth isn't accurate. A compelling love story, and even more compelling friendship are where I anchor my love for this movie.<br /><br />I'm not a movie critic, or a history buff. But to me, a good movie has to satisfy a few requirements.<br /><br />1. Make me laugh<br />2. Make me cry<br />3. Inspire me<br />4. Make me think<br /><br />Amazing cinematography and extreme watch ability make this one of my favorite action/drama films, period. I'm reviewing the 2 disc DVD, I don't know if the blue ray has the film on one disc, but I'd recommend a one disc viewing as there is only about 45 minutes on disc two. Since I dont like to interrupt any movie viewing the break between disc one and two kind of messes me up a little, but that's really my only complaint.<br /><br />Wreck diving footage of the Arizona at the end of the film really takes me back to visiting Pearl Harbor last year. Since the attack happened 30 years before I was even born this movie just makes me want to learn more of the actual history. I do NOT judge it for taking some story telling liberties, there are plenty of good film that account the actual event. An amazing soundtrack applies the polish to what I consider a very very good movie. Take All this into account and you'll enjoy it I think.

1451696191|2.0|I was really looking forward to this book because everyone says it is amazing. I also wanted to finish it before seeing the movie. The book was alright. Nothing bad, but nothing major. It was interesting to see a boy so sensitive from a male author though.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|It's everything temple run was and more! Love the new power ups, the new gameplay style, and graphics. However the controls are inconsistent. Many times I swipe to turn and it makes me jump, to my death. Never had this issue on the original....
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Wow amazing!! I love this amazing series of the hunger games imagine how it would be in a fourth book!!!
B0070Y46UY|2.0|I am trying to slog through this book because I bought it, but I don't like it. Now I am only half way through but that should give me a pretty good idea of the book's content and pace. It seems slow and unrealistic. The part of the beginning about the zoo and his religious experiences held my attention, but since the freighter sank and he explains his experiences on the lifeboat, I have lost interest. I don't know that I will finish the book.
1476712042|2.0|(1.5-2 area) I'm not going to lie I really had no idea what I was going to rate this book or what to write for the review. I really liked the beginning of the book and thought I was going to review this book higher, but as I kept reading my feelings towards the book became questionable. I have great admiration towards the author since she was an Indie author who was able to grow to a NY Times seller. I enjoyed the relationship in the beginning and the excitement of the underground fighting. However as the book grew on I was a little surprised how sexual the YA book was, but this might be in the midst of that whole new 'New Adult' genre forming. However my big problem was the obsession over the relationship that formed, between this and twilight and some other books I really do not get the whole obsession is attractive. I read books I like when the guy is protective and whatnot over the girl, but there is a fine line between protective and attachment issues, and this book is seeing that line a mile down the road. I felt pretty frustrated as characters kept making up excuses for the behavior as the friends even supported it for the most part. I did have a problem with the ending and the fact that there always seemed to be more to the plot. However minus the obsessive relationship which was really unhealthy I might be harder on this book because I was really excited to read this, then it kind of did not meet the expatiation I had.
B007THA4FI|3.0|&#34;The Casual Vacancy&#34; is certainly a change from the &#34;Harry Potter&#34; novels which rocketed Ms. Rowling to fame, fortune, and instantaneous name recognition!  &#34;The Casual Vacancy&#34; is  a story of a small, but snobby, English village in which a village council member drops dead with an aneurysm or stroke (I can't remember which).  Of course he must be replaced as quickly as possible as not to disrupt governance.  In the ensuing days the citizens of the village show their true colors and reveal their allegiance to one &#34;side&#34; or another.  They also show their class-conscieniouness and pettishness.  To add to the mess, the neighboring village is lower-middle-class whom the uppity citizens may look down upon.  The lower class village does provide crime, drug use and addiction, and vulgar behavior.  Of course there is overlap between between the villages.  &#34;The Casual vacancy&#34; is somewhat enlightening as to the workings of the British class system.  Had the book been written in the 1950's perhaps it could be a companion to &#34;Peyton Place&#34;-there are similarities; but neither would raise an eyebrow today.

B000E8QVWY|5.0|Good movie about the life of Johnny Cash and his wife June Carter.Reese Witherspoon and Joaquin Phoenix give great performances and make this movie so interesting in drags you deep into it. I found it very entertaining. After you watch it, you need to watch &#34;Walk Hard: The Drewey Cox Story for a great laugh.

141659521X|3.0|The last time I read a Flynn book about special agent cum assassin, Mitch Rapp, I told myself it was the last. But this book was set in Afghanistan and Pakistan, two countries that continually capture my interest, so I was hooked again. And I must say, it was well written with a rather complicated plot that kept me reading.<br /><br />Joe Rickman, head of CIA ops in Afghanistan is kidnapped and his bodyguards killed. In his head Rickman holds a zillion secrets. Mitch Rapp's boss, Irene Kennedy, sends him out with some of his special forces buddies to find Rickman fast, less the world-wide net of CIA operatives and informants unravel. Rapp quickly finds that other US agencies are also searching, and quick to blame Rapp.<br /><br />The Last Man rates a 4 out of 5 for writing and plot, but a 2 for the underlying assumptions that the only way to defeat militants is by ruthless and deceitful use of deadly force. I'm sure many would label me naive, but having spent 16 years in Pakistan, I really believe gentler methods will achieve much more in the long run. I'm troubled that more and more, some seem to assume that the only way to fight terrorism is by using overwhelming power, torture, and military force.
B0044WSGXI|4.0|This movie is a classic, and still entertaining today. The video and audio quality could have been a little better,IMO.

0061474355|5.0|Sabriel is one of the most amazing books I've read in a long time. I was taken with it when the first hint of magic was involved. I've read a lot of fantasy in my time, but Sabriel takes the cake. The story is well played out, relationships are dynamic, and there's even an anti-hero, my favorite kind of character! Sabriel is a must read for all ages starting at 13, and the sequels are just as amazing!
141659521X|5.0|I like Flynn's novels,  Have read all of them and find them exceptional as a an adventure.  It's interesting that these books take a year or so to write, but are current in events and information regarding Iraq and Afghanistan.  For me, they<br />are helpful in forgetting my own problems, I love the thrill.<br /><br />I wish the best for Vince Flynn and hope the worst is over.  Looking forward to the next book.<br /><br />PS:  The picture on the back cover is awesome.

B003JTHXOK|4.0|Safe Haven is a good read that deals with issues many women face.  I encourage everyone to read this good story.
B0024SQW2Q|5.0|I may be biased because I love, love this series.  This was the only one out of the 4 that I had not seen.  I actually saw the fourth prior to the 3rd.  I decided to go back and watch them in order and I believe that this one was my favorite.  It tied the other movies together really well.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|It killed time when I was waiting around with nothing better to do. I like the game just fine for that purposes.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|Best app I have it is allowing me to go through the Bible the way I want to. The only draw back is the need for wick to make it work.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I was highly disappointed after all the hype. I found the heroine annoying and strangely naive for a woman of the 21st Century, even if she was just graduating from college. The sex scenes bareloy carried a meager plot forward. They reminded me of the writing in early 1980's romance fiction, soft porn at the center of a plot that's just there to surround the chewy center. The subject matter didn't particularly bother me; I just couldn't warm up to any of the characters, got seriousloy tired of the inner monologue, and found myself starting to skim sex scenes to look for plot developments -- they pretty much weren't there.
B00AVPYT8I|4.0|Great app for finding free e-books for kindle. &#34;If It's Free, It's For Me&#34;! Very ease to use. I reccomend it.

B008MG1E4A|5.0|This is one of those books that you just can't easily put down.  It starts a bit slow, but gets you involved so that you want to find out what is on the next page.  There are a few facts in the book that dispute the way Obama and the White House told it.  I am glad someone that was right there when things happened put down exactly what he witnessed.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|I really enjoyed The Dark Knight Rises. Very entertaining and just as good as The Dark Knight Rises. Nolan's fingerprints are obviously all over this film as well. The level of attention to detail is amazing. The soundtrack is out of this world! Don't hesitate to pick this up. I buy very few movies but this is a &#34;own&#34; for sure.

1400067820|3.0|A new book by Nassim Nicholas Taleb was published in November 2012 by Random House in the United States and Penguin in the United Kingdom, titled Antifragile: Things That Gain From Disorder, at first stimulating, but ultimately a jumbled and flawed presentation of an interesting idea.<br /><br />Has Taleb heard of the Feminist Revolution?<br /><br />After reading dozens of reviews of Taleb's new book Anti-Fragile, I don't have much to add to the evaluations of anti-fragility itself. Many assessments are detailed and erudite, and it is clear that Taleb arouses and stimulates discussion. That alone is reason to be interested in his writing. Taleb uses colorful language and coins fanciful terms like `black swans,' a continuation of earlier writing, and `anti-fragile,' the subject of this volume.  Weaknesses pop up, however, early in the un-edited, verbose, flight of fancy pages, and grow larger as the book moves into middle chapters outlining the same concepts by drawing different pictures.<br />Reading the first chapters, the fresh concept and novel, anecdotal writing style drew me in. I was able to suspend the annoyance I felt with discrepancies and omissions. However, as I continued to read, I felt less able to focus on the concept and more thinking: who is this bountifully opinionated, myopic, overly-confident guy? His personality overcomes the ideas so that Anti-fragile quickly becomes more about the author than the intended subject.<br />First, what I understand to be the subject. A person (or entity) who can weather a certain amount of bad times is what Taleb calls robust, which is good because it's good to be strong. To improve on that, to be anti-fragile trumps robust because undergoing painful events--gaining from disorder--actually makes you stronger. What's more, understanding and welcoming these events, will make you strongest. Since much of life is painful, this is a positive spin on the circumstance of most human life.  It's appealing to read about how the pain in our lives is needed, that a certain amount of suffering and affliction is something to welcome, instead of dodge.<br />Taleb has what he calls logical papers and more mathematical writing; as I am not a scientist or a mathematician, nor have I read his technical papers, I can't speak to that. But this book, aimed at being user-friendly, is less essay and more biography, with a strong leaning toward tirade. Flavorful, interesting, but based more on anecdote, even cult of personality, than laid out logic. I'd go so far as to say that good user-friendly writing is always sensible and logical, while this is not, although at times it can be. I wish for more of that, because these are worthy ideas.<br />However, Taleb's ideas, like most, are not new. Yet he presents anti-fragile as such. the closest definition Taleb finds to anti-fragile is hormesis, which is defined as a biological phenomenon whereby a beneficial result (improved health, stress tolerance) is gained from exposure to low doses of an agent that is toxic or lethal when given at higher doses.  Taleb outlines why the two concepts are not the same. His logic follows that anti-fragile is a unique and new concept. It's true that this is a new definition; As he explains, no word has made its way into the English dictionary to define anti-fragile. Fragile breaks from disorder; anti-fragile gains from disorder.<br /> Yet, the concept and practice of gaining from disorder, distress or pain is ancient and well-known in certain circles. This lack of awareness by Taleb leads me to read his writing with a grain of salt. For example, anti-fragility is one of the foundations of Buddhist practice. For those who have studied Buddhism, a good example can be seen in the Five Slogans of Machig Labdron (a Famous Tibetan Teacher who happens to be a woman):<br />1)  Confess your hidden faults. 2)  Approach what you find repulsive. 3)  Help those you think you cannot help (sometimes translated as those you do not want tohelp). 4)  Anything you are attached to, give that. 5)  Go to the places that scare you.<br />Without going further into Buddhist thoughts, these Edicts are clear: an anti-fragile being will thrive only by confronting the pain of living.<br />The other exasperating, foundational oversight in this peculiar book is that Taleb likes to note many revolutions and evolutions in history, but forgets a little phenomenon called the Feminist Revolution, sometimes called or connected to the Sexual Revolution. For most of the book, it's as if the man is writing in a vacuum of time or from some hermetic back room where women barely exist. I recognize that many parts of the world, parts Taleb may have spent segments of his life in, have not had the benefit of this historical change. However, if you are going to be in print in English, and printed in New York of all places, the oversight is incredible. Taleb's lack of ability to take women's contribution and existence into his writing leaves a huge, indefensible--frankly suspect--hole.  For example, his one chapter where women's contribution is noted is called:  The Touristification of the Soccer Mom, outlining in brief, puzzling strokes, how what he calls `soccer moms' are the greatest hindrance to a child's development.<br />Women are noted in less than a dozen sentences in a book of over 400 pages, and wow when he does make mention, his ignorance and bias is quite conspicuous. In the Soccer Mom chapter, he blames soccer moms for hindering their children, without any clarification for this assertion. Although later he makes a slight mention of a soccer pop, in this chapter it's as if the males don't exist, those men you hear about all the time in the news who become physically and verbally violent if their child is either a) hampered from participating or b) given what the father considers a bad call.<br />It's as if Taleb has had no interaction with American families where the overwhelming opinion and historical evidence (news, print, popular media) is that mothers are the main nurturers of children, educational or otherwise. Although there has been an identified subgroup of people Americans call soccer moms, this is mostly for political delineation (as a voter group), and has little to do with the actual way American parents bring up their children. Soccer moms are defined more by the crazy driving schedules assigned to them in modern family life.  If you are going to ascribe the term Soccer Mom, as Taleb does, as a mother who is involved with their child's scholastic and hobby practice, by what logic can one charge these mothers as hampering their children? Taleb's writing could benefit greatly from more mindful judgments; Much of this writing is whimsical assumption.<br />Strange it would seem to Taleb that most first world parents consider it the role of both parents, mother and father, to raise and guide the education of to their children. In later pages, Taleb spends a lot of ink praising his father--disorderly, disvaluing education--as the main force behind his upbringing. He does not mention his mother in any direct way. From his personal experience there appears to be an extrapolation about families in general. I wonder, where included in the anti-fragile universe are the so-called non-soccer moms in the world? If you are not a soccer mom or a disorderly dad, where are you in Taleb's spectrum of parenting? Non-existent? Quietly demurring in back rooms?<br />The chapter \\"How to Become Mother Teresa\\" reveals more jaundice. If Taleb wrote one word about how Mother Teresa was a positive force in the world that would have been great. Instead, in quite the opposite vein, Taleb paints a cautionary tale of a sweet-looking yet husband-swindling woman he knew to prove his argument that victims (sacrifices) create learning and anti-fragility for others (the men she didn't marry). I know that when I think of the victims of this world, rich divorced men come to mind near last. How about you?Yet this is the major anecdote that comes to Taleb's mind when wanting to portray victims.<br />Thoughts about economy and philosophy, however important, cannot exist in a bubble of masculine, platonic, hierarchical solitude. In the same chapter \\"A Lesson in Disorder\\" soon after, Taleb outlines what he calls his `barbell education', further underscoring the problems with this book. Out of perhaps thirty writers he shares that he read when young, one was a woman, Anais Nin. I love Nin as much as the next person, but that style of authorship is but a small snippet of women's writing--serious, deep, important writing that happens to be authored by women. Again, Taleb exhibits no attempt to acquaint himself with women's impact, this time in literature. Taleb's ideas, however erudite, need to reflect the modern world where women exist, took part in history, write and read books.<br />As a woman, a writer and editor and as a person who is part of the world (with husbands, kids, families), I found Taleb's writing muddy and rocky. I wanted to forge ahead, but I kept tripping over flaws. How can I ponder the intricacies of an idea when its execution is so awkward? If you do not count the balance of all people in your readership that the modern view at least attempts to reflect, your ideas are going to be skewed, and thankfully outdated.<br />I've taken some time to look over the over 170 reviews on Amazon to test my theory and I find that I was right. There is nary one woman writer providing a review. Some reviewer names are \\"opaque\\" so I can't tell about those. But the names that I could read were all men.<br />Most women are not patient enough to wade through a tome where they might as well be aliens--that is, if they are not prostitutes, gold-diggers or soccer moms, the major contributions Taleb attributes to women in history.<br />Taleb is obviously a brilliant guy, and it would make his writing far more readable if he recognized the other half of the human race who arein fact successful--anti-fragile--teachers, parents, bankers, economists, writers, thinkers and history-makers. I'd like to hear a point being made by a person who accedes that I am a person in the room with an opinion and a history that matters.

Some young people may not enjoy it, they feel it moves too slow, but the message is very clear; especially to couples who have been together for a long time.

B0042RJWTC|1.0|We saw The Tudors through Netflix bitstream and loved it so much that we ordered the complete series, brand new set, through DVDBargainbuy (vendor).  Major problems with the entire set.  It wouldn't load on some DVD's and/or it stopped playing.  The vendor recommended we clean the DVDs twice in warm soapy water, we did, they still didn't work; then recommended we buy a DVD repair kit.  We bought the kit, repaired the DVDs as instructed, they still did not work.  DVDBargainbuy told us to send the set to DVD Exchange in Maryland.  In the course of this, we moved to another state. When we returned the set to Maryland, we explained the problem in the letter and gave them instructions to mail the replacement to our new address.  They sent the replacement set out on January 4th to our OLD address, it was supposedly forwarded to us on January 15th and as of January 29th, we still have not received our working set.  We reorderd The Tudors Complete Series through Amazon.com and they are working toward a resolution for us with the original vendor.
B006LSZECO|4.0|The first half of this book was INCREDIBLY slow...for some reason I stuck with it---complete boredom at work, and was pleasantly surprised.  The ending was good and captivating but not sure if the drawn out beginning was entirely worth it.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|I had a good time with this game.  The graphics were good and it took some thought and concentration to get where you needed to go.  The map feature helped a lot!
B0083GQKQG|2.0|Plot and flashbacks are way too choppy.  The movie became tedious and boring.  The acting was good, but I almost didn't finish watching the movie.
B002RI9O9G|3.0|I found this book a bit short and the ending very unsatisfactory. overall I was disappointed with the book.<br />and would not be happy to recommend it.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|11/22/63 is certainly not King's best writing, but it s perhaps his most well researched and one of the more thoughtful writings.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I enjoyed the first book far more than the first.  Unfortunately the internet and friends have given away much of the plot here in the second book of the series.  All in all, it is a quick and fun read.
0765348276|4.0|I haven't read a lot of science fiction but this was very good. I finished it in two days and found myself reading late into the night when I should have been sleeping. I don't want to say too much but thanks to the technology of the skip drive, humans have begun to colonize other planets throughout the universe. However, we have also discovered lots of other species and some of them are very hostile. The Colonial Defense Force seeks to protect the colonists and expand to new planets. CDF recruits are humans living on Earth that have reached 75 years of age. That's all I'm going to say but if you have any interest in science fiction you should read this.<br /><br />Scalzi is definitely influenced by Heinlein and acknowledges it at the end of the book. While comparisons to Starship Troopers are inevitable, I found this to be superior. Scalzi not only creates a fascinating world of high technology and alien species but he also creates believable characters. I hope that his subsequent novels are of the same quality as this book left me wanting to know even more about the characters, alien races and the struggle of the human race to survive in a very hostile universe.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|this game is a very intense and fun game! it is a great sequel and has beautiful graphics! HOWEVER some people might take it to be difficult and get frustrated!
B0063IH60K|3.0|Only one game version but okay for a free game. I can win some times. easy to figure out how t play
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Perhaps you'll think it's corny but don't put it down. It's about believing in yourself. And about being loved. There's nothing corny about that.
B004SUWR2C|5.0|GOOD GRAPHICS layout WOULD RECOMMEND TO OTHERS very user friendly can choose number of players to play with playable from device
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book was great can't wait to start the next one. So off I go to buy the next one.
B00AYB1RGG|5.0|This movie is fantastic. A surprisingly solid, cohesive story that isn't one tenth as hammy as the Stallone adaptation. With action that will have you hopping out of your seat and cheering for more. Really hope they do a sequel in the same vain. A movie that every guy will love.
B000274THQ|5.0|We saw the film on the weekend with our teens (14 and 15) and we all loved the film - although it was a trifle slow for the kids....i had seen the film earlier in flight a few years ago and wanted to see it again with the kids...loved the theme and the storyline...loved the acting as well as the way it was handled
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I la-la-loved this book. One of my favs...you won't be disappointed.<br /><br />Characters and story line are great. I had no regrets!
B000021Y77|4.0|I bought the film as i enjoy foreign films (hollywoods handling of films is quite typical so foreign films add the something extra)- we saw this film as a family (with 2 teens) - i loved it but the kids groaned at times when they had to see the same scene repeated 3 times with difference. It was memorable and loved the direction and raciness
B007BFSYMS|5.0|Great sounds. It's extremely relaxing and easy to use. The sounds are just loud enough to relax your entire body.
B00A6N8F4Y|4.0|This was a well made movie that dealt with the trials and tribulations of modern drug dealing as well as the increasing dangers.  Needless to say there is a lot of violence, as there is in fact with any drug dealing.  Mexican Cartel against Yankee free lancers and the extremes both sides have to resort to keep things the way they want.  A good watch and a little differant while being a little too true.
1118156315|4.0|I Like it, es muy bueno, es una buena idea aplicar el modelo campas a  la vida personal, profesional, las personas tambien debemos ser competitivas y generar  y entregar valor
B004GXKBFQ|5.0|As much as I love anything to do with Peter Pan, I had NEVER seen this movie!! Absolutely amazing. As with any interpretation, they mixed storylines together to create something new, and it worked beautifully. A++
B004OC07F8|5.0|Todos saben lo bueno del libro,por eso ha vendido  tantas copias, se trata de algo que debería ser más de la cultura competitiva de todas las empresas en todo el mundo.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|The graphics are way better than Temple Run 1.  There are more characters available.<br />It's more fast paced and challenging.  The course is less monotonous than in Temple Run 1.<br />I love this game and am glad I downloaded it.
B008FRFN7A|2.0|Had high hopes for this one after reading the reviews, but am very disappointed.  It found my printer fine and says the print job was successful, but it didn't print.  Am using a Kindle Fire 2nd edition.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Only thing about it, if you rady John's books I had figured it ot about 3/4 of the way thru ... I still could not put it down!
B008JF8O9M|2.0|Worked fine on my Kindle Fire for awhile, then all of a sudden it quit working altogether.  Have uninstalled it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|greeeaaattttt apppp! love this so much fun! it lags a little in contests but overall great! I really like how its like taking care of a real horse!
B008476HBM|4.0|After enjoying several movie versions of this book I wanted to read the original, and was not disappointed. The only (minor) thing I found was the &#34;soap opera&#34; quality of much of the dialogue.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Olive the game, but gameplay may be slow at the beginning if you aren't willing to spend a few bucks for in game credits and what not.  Still, a worthwhile free game to waste time with.
B000FC1HBY|4.0|The world and the people that Martin has created are fascinating and leave you wanting to know what is going to happen to them next. Can't wait to read the next book.
B00A0SKFLG|2.0|If you're looking for even as much plot as the original, forget it -- the movie moves from one action scene to another without enough (almost any) time devoted to the plot. I'm an action junkie, so believe me when I say this is just pointless action. I liked a few fight/flight scenes, but that's about it.<br /><br />Wait to watch it on TV.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Just as fun as the first one, performs better on my kindle fire as well. Has a few new twists and additions which keep it fresh enough, and the addictiveness and &quot;just one more run&quot; attitude is as strong as ever.
B0086700CM|4.0|My teenagers love it. I personally haven't tried it. If you are afraid of monsters, don't play it. They like Temple Run two better. I think because of the size of the monster.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|Love the dragons and surprise eggs but when I do something, like change dragons or hatch eggs I get kicked out
B0063GORYU|3.0|I really don't care for it but my daughters love it. I might try it sometime. I do like regular solitaire.
B00881PPTO|1.0|had problems from beginning. had to download and did not care for the game.  need to find better game support
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love playing it. Makes your mind work and challenges you. You have to make sure you have a lot of time. Its addicting once you start.
B009LK6JS2|1.0|would not download  once downloaded did not enjoy game.  more game support needed for this type of game play and dowload
B0063IH60K|4.0|Don't play this one as much but still a good game.  Anyone could play it. I need to play it more
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Definitely a book that I would read again.<br />And again...it's just so entertaining.<br />Just the right amount killing with nit too much details but just enough to get the imagination going.
B0002JP4L4|3.0|The movie could be a bit better with language, other than that not a bad show  Not recommended for children.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|I'm completely hooked on this show.  I love it.  Every season so far has brought an interesting and unexpected new angle to the story.  And so far, season 8 is no exception.  I bought season 8 through Amazon instant video.  I love getting the new episodes as soon as they come out so I can watch them again.
B0053O89WY|5.0|Sheldon (Jim Parsons) is brilliant at being a genius. His acting brilliance is genius. This show would be nothing without Penny (Kaley Cuoco). Her Nebraska charm and poignant facial expressions along with her comedic demeanor make this show. I love the theme of this show because it's about being entertaining without having to make a political statement or worry about being politically correct. It's just funny. It is the Andy Griffith's show of the new millennium. The casting director was almost perfect, the only sore spot is Leonard (Johnny Galecki) because he is irritating to watch. He kisses like a 4 year old, for being a supposed doctor in physics his idocy is ever apparant. No one could have that much education yet be that stupid. His acting is forced and lacking in believability. All in all a great show that you can watch over and over and still be entertaining.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|It is great fun working through the levels of games and not as addicting as I had feared it might be.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|OMG this book was absolutely amazing!! I never write book reviews but i felt like i had to write one on this one. This book had me hooked from the first page and didnt let go until the last one. If you havent read this book yet you are missing out!!!!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love temple run two all these new graphics have been added it makes so much fun to play love this app
B006OOHYIC|5.0|it seems like there isnt much to it but you find yourself hooked in no time.  thinking game but with the music it is still quite relaxing.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I just really enjoy this game.  It real help pass the time.  very entertaining.  story telling was  entertaining  love it
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|This show was a shocking story, but it was very well written. It kept you on your toes and Jessica Lange is just fabulous. I am not really into really scary or provocative shows, but this one I had to watch every episode (though I close my eyes a lot!  lol)
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I loved the app just wish you could get more jems faster and easyier along with the coins other wise I liked it a lot!
B004LLDN3A|5.0|Dick Van Dyke, Julie Andrews, how could anyone not give them 5 stars!!! This is a classic . I was so happy to share this with my 2 year old grandson.He's still trying to say &#34;superfragilisticexpialidocious&#34; !
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|We all know that Andrea Bocelli's first love is Performing Opera, but he also loves to do pop music and when it comes down to it he is more well know for his pop albums such as Romanza, Sogno, Amore, etc., then he is for many of his Opera albums. This new recording Passione is a pop recording of Italian, Neapolitan (an Italian Dialect), Spanish, Portuguese and English songs and is his third Album With David Fostor doing the producing. The other Two are Amore (Amor) and a Christmas Album called My Christmas. Passione is really a part two of the Album Amore. And as most know David Fostor wrote the Song, the Prayer that has been done by many but made famous by Andrea and Celine Dion. It was one of Bocelli's early mega hits along with Con Te Partiro and Il Mare Calmo Della Sera.<br /><br />As with any Bocilli Album and David Foster they are very well done, the production is great, the musicians are wonderful, and of course Bocelli's voice is simply beautiful. Bocelli's voice reaches into the heart and soul of many of us, thats why we are fans. This is a very smooth romantic and wonderful album you can listen all the way through.<br /><br />The Tracks are (and I would suggest you get the deluxe edition and get the four extra songs)<br /><br />1. Perfidia -a really nice start hear very smooth and Beautiful.<br />2. Roma Nun Fa La Stupida Stasera - I have not heard this one before or if I have I had forgotten its really good.<br />3. Champagne- Very nice, All the songs sound very romantic, its the voice.<br />4. Anema E Core- I just love this song.<br />5. Quizas, Quizas, Quizas (perhaps, Perhaps, Perhaps) With Jennifer Lopez an Interesting mix of voices. Natalie Cole has been doing this song with Bocelli at some live venues as well. And Andrea is working on a duet with her for her next album witch will be a latin album. This is a very cool version very playful and romantic.<br />6. Era gia tutto previsto- A beautiful song.<br />7. Tristeza - Excellent.<br />8. La Vie en Rose with the Late Edith Piaf. If these is a week song on the CD its this one I like it but the old recordings just don't match the new recordings all that well. And I know this has been done before by others. But having said that its a wonderful tribute to the great Edith Piaf.<br />9. Corcovado with Nelly Furtado is another interesting pairing for Bocelli, I like Furtado she has a lite but very sexy voice and Bocelli matches good with her and does not over sing. He is a rear opera singer that can sing pop, as it should be sang, and not make everything sound like Opera. I really love this duet.<br />10. Sara' Settembre -This is the Italian version of the song made famous by Neil Diamond's \\"September Morn\\" Bocelli wrote the Italian lyrics with permission from the songs writers by Neil Diamond and Gilbert Becaud Stay. Bocelli goes a great job on this one.<br />11. Love In Portofino- (this is also the title of Bocelli's upcoming Live DVD), This is my favorite song on the CD, Just Beautiful.<br />12. Garota De Ipanema - Always have loved this song since I was a child from Sinatra to Bocelli and many other versions, I know Andrea has wanted to record this for a long time and wants to record many Portuguese language songs).<br />13. Malafemmena -This one Is a great song that has been sang by many done such as Sergio Franchi, Bocelli does an excellent job.<br />14. Love Me Tender (BO does Elvis well)<br />15. Il Nostro Incontro- Very pretty and also features Chris Botti.<br />16. Senza Fine- really nice.<br />17. A Mano A Mano -A Beautiful song.<br />18. When I Fall In Love  *With Chris Botti) - A Really nice version of this song in english and I know many Bocelli fans would love for him to do an album in all english. Quizas!<br /><br />Passione is a wonderful selection of songs is beautifully done and is a must have for lovers of Beautiful Music and all Bocelli fans.ose with the Late Edith Piaf.

B00470TOV0|5.0|I loved this movie, and will still watch it on occasion. It keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|the  game is simple and fun, easy to play, hard to master, and it is free. This is a good review
B0036K3OFY|5.0|action packed. one of my favs. I downloaded it to my ipod and i have no idea how to play it without using the app. Plus i had no idea that amazon instant movie not an app for android.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|its way fun :) I have it on my kindle but the family has a kindle HD and its way nice playing on it so just get it and try it
B003O86FMW|5.0|Awesome!!! Couldn't stop reading! J was very addicted n gasped a lot. Can't wait to keep reading from this series!!
B008RA3X5E|4.0|I love this alarm clock althoughbi wish I didn't have to pay extra to have my own song to wake me up in the mornings.... the alarm is still just a little too Quiet for me.... sometimes i almost sleep in!!! other than that I ALOVE the clock
B004VMUS9G|4.0|I love this freaking app only this is when you have it set to where you solve math problems to hit dismiss like if you hit the mute button on an accident there's no way for you to unmute it, it sucks. =[
0756914582|5.0|This is my 10 and 12 year old girl & boy review:<br />This is a twist on the pied piper story. Maurice, a self-centered ugly cat, finds a stupid-looking boy who plays the flute & a bunch of rodents, & convinces them to trick towns' people into paying the boy money to get rid of the rats. They get to a town and meet an opinionated funny little girl, and together they figure out the mystery of this town and save everybody. The narrator is very good at expressing the characters in his voice. This is one of the best audiobooks we've enjoyed. A must read/ listen to boys and girls of all ages.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This was excellent game for money. It is long with plenty of content and it is not so hard that you have to check for help all the time, though did need it occasionally as I tend to be impatient. DID NOT like the ending all is my only complaint; but looks like they are doing a sequel. Would recommend to my friends.
B00A757EFW|5.0|I HAVE ALWAYS LIKED PAC MAN<br />now I have on my Kindle fire<br />Makes me feel more at home on kindle
B00ADIT8U2|5.0|Was a really fun game, but is NOT a hidden object game !! IT COMES UP WHEN looking for hidden object games though.  WAS fun to just solve something and there are a lot of puzzles to solve in this also. Would recommend game to friends &amp; worth the money.  These people also have direct link to them if you have any problems, which is VERY NICE ! I did not have any problems, except there is not as much to find on Kindle version, though did not affect my game. They mainly left out bonus stuff.  Thanks
B005OCHOZS|1.0|I don't know why this is in my box...never ordered this so I am replying to get this off my list.  Thank you.
B00AMBM9MO|5.0|Loved it. I saw it at the movies and loved it then. And loved it now. LOL and great bear.
B00A0SJWQU|3.0|Of course, I saw the first one with Arnold.  So, it is hard &#34;not&#34; to compare this title to that one (I give them both 3 stars out of 5).  Quite honestly, the movie was 'good enough' - not great but ok.  If you like scifi, then you will be able to 'get through this'.
B0084BMUFA|4.0|The second best book in the world! (The best being the bible) I absolutely love this story and the meaning behind it.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This book although about a sad topic of a quadraplegic, was also a beautiful one, where the caretaker had a earth shattering character development just by being with the handicapped man. It was a hauntingly good story!
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is so fun and addictive. I cant stop playing this game. it is a must get game in my opinion. it is an awesome game. I luv the game.!.!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I  watched one show due to the fact that I saw the show won the SAG award for best ensemble in a drama series.  I thought I might see what the show was about.  I'm addicted now!!  I have watched Season 1 - 3 in the matter of 4 days.  I love the show!!
B0098VXE50|3.0|Charlize is, as always, up to the task of infusing new life and dimension into a well-known character we've seen (or imagined) many times.  Bravo to her performance.  Stewart, on the other hand, is as drab and uninteresting as in every other film she's done (and I'm pretty sure I've seen them all).  I went into this hoping to see her finally do something different for once, but it just doesn't happen.  Not that all Snow Whites have to be sweet and innocent and Disney-esque, but she provides absolutely no reason to cheer for her character.  It got to the point where I was hoping a huge new twist would happen and that the Evil Queen would triumph in the end!
B0011UJMK2|5.0|I found the beginning to beat somewhat confusing and a little difficult to follow. However, as the story progressed it all connected. The story was completely believable and providing great insight into conditions in Russia during that era. I have already started the second book of the trilogy.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|When you need a quick calculator, this one works well following mathamatical logic.  Only failing I find is it needs a square root function.
1451627297|5.0|After almost a year of not finishing novels, this one gripped me from page 1 and I read it in three days. Excellent plotting, good-enough character development, and a love story that feels central and important to the story, not tacked on. This was a book worth finishing with an ending that really satisfied me and moved me at the same time. Highly recommended!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|OK, it's the Bible, my favorite book. This electronic version is nicely done--searchable and capable of bookmarks. You can also set up and follow reading plans. A delight is that multiple translations are available, some of which can be downloaded for offline reading, such as on airplanes.
B008602KQI|5.0|Love, love, love this movie.  I bought it new because I want to watch it over and over again.  I will keep it forever.
B001NLKT60|4.0|I would say this book overall is ok.  Personally, I liked the first book better but will be purchasing the final book in the series today.
B005LAIHSQ|5.0|Got this for grandchildren.  My son and his family didn't like it; said it was boring.  I haven't seen it yet.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|great graphics, fast, different run every try, really enjoying this. also &quot;upgrades&quot; earned with coin won or purchased ( l hate to pay for free games ).<br />Thank You
B00005JPD0|5.0|Anything with Denzel in it is wonderful.  The DVD was good quality.  I try to buy used when it is for me.
B00000J6AG|5.0|After 600 reviews praising this Moby's work it's hard to add anything here. Yes, these are beautiful songs... At least most of them. I just want to give you one suggestion - if you live in a scenic region like I do (Pacific Northwest) just take your car out on a freeway during a the time of low traffic, and start driving somewhere while listening to the song \\"Evervolving\\". This is my favorite and I still remember driving in Yellowstone NP while listening to it - this is one of my warmest memories ever.
B005LAIGRS|5.0|Anything with Denzel in it is wonderful.  The DVD was good quality.  I try to buy used when it is for me.
1568363931|3.0|I like the book its got great recipes and I would recommend it for any one who wants to start learning bento.  This is my first book and I am also just starting out but I really like this book.  The only down side was that the front cover was bent a little in the top middle and it made a weird crease.  So what the packaging but overall I like the book its got great material.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|Love, love, love this movie.  Glad to see that it won several Oscars.  Will watch it over and over again.
0756697875|5.0|Great Christmas present for young  Batman fan. My grandson is 6 and loves the book. And the hair acted tht comes with it.
B007B6VOG0|5.0|I love this album. I usually listen to rock music but I am addicted to this album. Its different than anything I heard.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|Too many quirky bugs.  I've lost gems and been restarted when trying to use the Save Me feature then it puts me at -1 gems so I have to find another gem just to get back to zero.  The monster gets in the way of seeing ahead when I trip, making navigation more difficult.  The game response is significantly worse than previous edition and gets frustrating.  much prefer the original.  The graphics while very nice can be overwhelming and overloads your view.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I really loved the style of the narrative.  I would recommend this book to fans of The Walking Dead.  This is an easy read and the stories and fictional accounts really kept me interested.  Good book.
B000002KXV|5.0|The Nightfly places Donald Fagen capturing the smoothest elements of Steely Dan's classic album Aja (producer Gary Katz included) and applying them to a retro-futuristic concept album based on his own perceptions about the future growing up in the golden years of the 50s' in the Bronx. The result is a gem of early 80s' vocal jazz-pop, a collection of themes that fuse the nostalgic musical elements of its fictional place in time (female harmonies, early bossa nova, lounge-like textures and space-age themes to mention a few) with the trademark of early 80s' smooth-jazz' production. It's a sensationally timeless affair that avoids the pitfalls of unrelateable nostalgia and mixes itself breezely among contemporary works, not only determining Fagen's own musical output, but also matching up to (what used to be) the Steely Dan standard of quality with dominating presence.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|i loved the book it was one of the best book i ever read buy it is awesome i love it you should read the other books it is really good percy and anabeth fall down a hole
B005LAIH4A|5.0|They love it!  And it's pretty cute, so I don't mind watching it with them occasionally.  Catchy music, too.  My four year old is always humming something from this!
B0084U0IEG|2.0|The first 10 per cent of this book was mildly interesting.  The author developed a female protagonist in a way that enticed the reader to care about her fate.  However reading the next 40 per cent of the book was like slogging through cement.  I expected so much more from Ian McEwan.  The resolution was prolonged with a bit of a twist, but not exciting.
0345529057|5.0|The best read i have had in a long time, have got series one on DVD, cant wait for the second.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|A great story.  A fantastic plot.  No profanity  No guns.  Looking forward to the next book.<br />Hope the next story has Gale as love interest.
B002RI9UBS|5.0|A great book to read for all ages, different and a change of pace from other story lines. highly recommended
B0034DGPEU|4.0|Reminded me of The Help in a way. Good beginning and ending but seemed to drag on in the middle too long.
B004W25KKW|4.0|What a change to read, this gives you a very different perspective on how to think about things and to try and  re-learn how to remember.  And you don't need to read it in one sitting.
B007Y36K46|4.0|Buy it instead whyto much to rent. My mistake. Most movies rent for 3.99 I should of looked first! slower conetions wont play this as good either. Pretty grainy
B0039Q7QKE|5.0|For the price I knew it was going to be metal, but I expected some minor flaws. Overall it actually is much better than expected. Good machining in the construction, a realistic brushed look, and it has decent heft. It easily fits in with the movie accurate replica's in my collection.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love this game.Bought it for my kindle.Now I can play it anywhere,while waiting at appointments,etc. I love it.Great to have games that are not violent
B0047Y0FGY|3.0|Tina Fey is clearly intelligent, experienced, and hilarious. And yet her acclaimed memoir doesn't do it for me. Sometimes trying too hard, sometimes skipping around, Fey lacks a central thread to pull throughout.
B0086700CM|4.0|My daughter got this game on my kindle so she could play it. She loves it, and it has no violence in it so I love it to.
0307341577|4.0|Maybe because I read Gone Girl first, I did not find this novel to even contend. From reading her three novels, I find that Flynn is wonderful at writing interesting and well-developed female leads. I like that she leaves out the romantic subplot that drowns many other stories that otherwise have potential. Still, Dark Places protagonist Libby is difficult to relate to, and I even consider myself to be somewhat of an asocial eccentric. Technically well-written, but not Flynn's best work.
B00797MB0O|1.0|Previews made it look like a good movie... and whomever created these trailers deserves a BIG FAT raise. Because seriously this movie sucked. If it wasn't for someone's (clearly very hard) work to make it look enjoyable, I would not have been remotely interested in the first place. TERRIBLE MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!
B006LSZECO|5.0|It is no wonder this one made it as a best seller. Flynn masterfully pieces together the fascinating world of a man and wife and the unique circumstances they create for themselves. The female antag is a one-of-a-kind in many ways, and genuinely relatable in others. You will not be able to guess how this story ends. But even more than that, you won't want it to end.
B0094K1QR8|5.0|I love this movie! Natalie Portman is my favorite actress and she is great in this, as always. I love her sense of humor... her comedic timing is impressive. Ashton Kutcher is typically pretty silly in his films, but did a good job in this. Kept his aloofness to a minimum and the chemistry between Natalie and Ashton, while palpable at times, made for a really great movie!!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Let me rephrase- for those have read a few books in their lives, you will find that this book is wrongly described as being pornographic. I have read James Patterson novels will saucier scenes. And Jackie Collins knocks James out of the park if we're talking about true smut. But beyond the misinterpretations, the story is a poorly executed re-write of Twilight. Redundancies abound. Characters have annoying idiosyncrasies. The protagonist is weak and embarrasses the true Western Woman. However, it's a fun light beach read just the same!
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|While I preferred season 1 over 2, I am continually surprised by the directions this show takes me.  Both the writing and the acting are superb.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is great. It has also of the features of the first temple run, and added many great segments such as the zipline and the monetary tracks. I love it.
B002Q1YDLI|5.0|This was an excellent follow up to Something Borrowed also by Emily Griffin . It wrapped up all the Manhattan,  sassy socialist  characteristics that Darcy possessed . The book delivered a full circle story leaving no stone unturned as well as many new discoveries.  From the beginning to the end a truly delightful book about friendships.
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|Game is rather...retarded for lack of a better word.  Wouldn't and haven't recommended to anyone as I dont know anyone that would bother with it.
B001JIFYSA|4.0|Great movie.  Great cast. Funny and heart warming.  ... short on the drama ....thank god. Love to watch it again.
B004A8ZWWO|5.0|Enjoyable entertainment for everyone. Ben Stiller performs his above average acting and comedy along with all the supporting actors and actresses.  AAA+++++
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I love this series and how involved get with the characters. Definitely a love story with the intrigue to keeps readers engaged.
B0006N2EZ0|5.0|The depth and beauty that was displayed in this movie is unequalled.  Since the tragic death of THE DIVA, Whitney Huston, I appreciate her music and acting more, since we don't have her in our physical lives anymore.  Dolly Parton was the only other artist to give justice to &#34;I Will Always Love You&#34;.  Watch Whitney enhance that beloved melody with her special harmonics and incredible range.  The action and suspense were commendable on Kevin Costner's part as well.
B004LSO7IS|5.0|This is a perfect movie for those of us who enjoy true romance.  The two characters are excellent, and I loved Necar Zadegan's voice especially.  Good chemistry between the actresses and some really cute comical dialogue in the supporting cast.  The intimate scenes are tastefully done and stress the sensuality and tenderness that can be beween two women.  I highly recommend it and give it a 5 star rating, taking into consideration it is an independant film company.  I also enjoyed the expressive exchanges between them, emphasing the love, rather than the sex.
B0053O89IS|5.0|If you like the murder mysteries, or any who done it type story or movie, this is for you!  Having been in Forensics, I have a special love of this program.  I highly recommend this for intelligent entertainment.
B007TNS6JI|4.0|The game is quite good however it's not without it's fault. Just a tad glitchy but still a good game.
0385344228|4.0|I enjoyed the book, the twists and turns kept me guessing. Somewhat predictable, but I was surprised by the ending.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game, really fun. At first it was hard to swap lanes, but after playing it enough it was easy to do. I just have one question: On the mystery box, if the mega headstarts are so rare, then why do I have thirteen of them?
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|This book is a thrilling adventure story that risks life or death and it adds a little bit of romance here or there! I thought that Ally Condie couldn't have created a better book, but she never ceases to amaze me. If anything, I couldn't put this book down! If you like the Hunger Games, you'll love Crossed.
B00AECGQF2|4.0|Fun, entertaining app for kids. Keeps them busy for hours, if I would let them play that long. Wish there were more characters, tho. Like that you can do their hair from start to finish, including washing, styling, cutting, coloring, adding accessories. Don't know if I would have paid for the app, but 3 year old downloaded it without permission. At least she likes it!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This game has been a blast to play. I play it everyday. I think this is a must app for anyone.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It seems like a good game to start with.The pix are good but they need more of a breed choice for the horses. And more of a variety of colors for their horses.
B0076I622Y|5.0|This is really great movie! I feel it was very fulfilling. Sometimes sad but then a very nice happy ending!
0316224588|4.0|So many similarities between Rebus' comeback from retirement and Harry Bosch's (Michael Connelly's series) to cold cases. Here we also get the benefit of a crossover between the Malcolm Fox series and the Rebus series. Overall a nice thriller though the resolution seemed a bit forced and incomplete to me. Rebus breaks even more rules than normal and gets Clarke involved again. Recommended.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Stephen King does an incredible job recreating the late 1950s/early 1960s while telling a thrilling story.<br />This book is difficult to put down once you start.
B000001GPW|5.0|I think Bartok is one of those composers who, at least in part, is an acquired taste, and these performances were instrumental in allowing me to acquire it myself. Admittedly, portions weren't easy going down at first, but it happened. I'm not musically trained and so I can't discuss these works in depth as others have; as a layman, however, I can testify to the power of these compositions and the recordings of them on this release. The performances really allow one to see with one's ears, if you know what I mean -- \\"see\\" structure and flow and purpose. After listening to some Bartok very long ago and not really caring about much of it other than the Concerto for Orchestra, I latched onto these recordings on vinyl as my first experience with the Piano Concertos and the rest became delicious history. Now, on disc, they still provide satisfaction and insight decades later.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|I enjoyed the story but it wasn't a \\"stay up all night\\" reading it kind of book.  Couldn't beat the price!
1439152802|5.0|As a teenager in the English countryside, Laurel witnesses a stranger confronting her mother, and a shocking, violent act. Many years later, she returns to the family home, now a famous actress, to meet with her sisters to care for her dying mother. Increasingly haunted by the event in her past, she begins to dig into her mother's history, finding some tantalizing clues, including a fur coat, and an inscribed copy of Peter Pan. Interspersed with Lauren's story is that of her mother as a young girl, and of her life at the time of the Blitz. It becomes clear that her mother is not the woman Lauren thought she was, and Laurel begins to remember comments from her mother and stories from her childhood that add up to additional clues. The historical portion is rich with detail and it becomes clear that she suffered from delusions about her life and may have been involved in a covered up crime. We see her vivid imagination as she imagines a friendship with a wealthy woman on her street, wife of an author, Vivian, and anticipates an inheritance from the woman for whom she is a companion. The author does a fantastic job of drawing you in, letting you make your own conclusions, and then with a deft twist, changing things up entirely.  This was an engrossing tale that kept my on my toes and surprised me.
B007FY9ZWI|1.0|It does play music sometimes, but I can rarely get it to work. It lags a lot and will currently not work. &gt;&hellip;&lt;
B0091QS88K|2.0|This is just a promo for the paid version. I got it for my 3 year old granddaughter, and when she finally got to the cooking part she really like it, but it was difficult to navigate.
B004C3DLJS|5.0|We have four boys ranging from 2 to 17. The Two Story series has been in our family since they first came out. I rented this for our 2 year old. This movie really tied together previous story lines in a heartfelt and funny way. We tend to watch these movies over and over again, they are the few that we get tired of. This is a great family film and has plenty of sarcasm and humor for parents to pick up on as well.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Fun to play, keep your mind and reflexes working. Doctors say to keep the mind busy. So that's what I am doing.,
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Blending classical music with pop music is an excellent exercise to the ears and the arrangements of the CD Piano Guys are very well made, clean and songs are hot to hear.
B001E75QH0|2.0|2 of the movies freeze for a second in 1 scene of each of the 2 movies. I'm not crazy about them doing that.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|This movie was hilarious I loved the tracks loved all the music played & I can't wait for a sequel hopefully its just as good.  Best movie I've seen this year :)
B005LAIHPY|3.0|I don't remember hearing a good thing about this when it first came out - and so my expectations having been set correspondingly low, I came away rather pleasantly surprised.  In tone, scale and aspiration this is a [[ASIN:B0060FXBNM Transformers Trilogy (Transformers / Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen / Transformers: Dark of the Moon) [Blu-ray]]] clone - it's even generated by the same toy company, Hasbro.  How you feel about a movie whose success hinges on how good its special effects are and how gorgeous the cast are, above such other criteria such as, say, acting or script, will largely determine how much you enjoy this movie.<br />Plot-wise, slacker Taylor Kitsch has been encouraged to join the Navy by his high performing brother, under the gruff command of Admiral Liam Neeson.  He does this to win the hand of the Admiral's unfeasibly gorgeous daughter who seems to serve no purpose other than wearing ultra tight denim shorts and straddling Taylor in provocative poses, and who is inexplicably drawn to him.  Things get complicated when Aliens land in the ocean next to a huge naval exercise and their intentions are clearly more Decepticon than Autobot...  When the action kicks off, it's all wildly over the top, and yet done with such excellent effects and solid editing (hooray, Michael Bay-like frenetic editing has been dialed down so you can actually see what's going on..) that there's quite a lot of fun to be had.  Rihanna is surprisingly underplayed in a supporting role, Liam Neeson is.. well, Liam Neeson and the rest of the cast ably put Tab A into Slot B for their respective prescribed character developments.<br />As a US Navy propaganda it actually works well, in a Top-Gun-at-sea sort of way. The effects are genuinely quite impressive, with stuff blowing up, vaporizing and blasting around in a way that actually seems to look realistic, even if physicists will struggle not to place their head in their hands and shake it at some of the plot points (why DO radio waves beamed into space need to be a striking white beam of light that zings and shimmers..?).  I found the time went fairly quickly and chuckles and thrills outweighed the cringing. Not at all as bad as the nay-sayers would have you believe, and fun if you can suspend disbelief long enough.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple Run 2 is awesome! I do (rarely) have problems with it restarting sometimes when I try t  use the same me option, but other than that I absolutely love it! So much fun!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is awesome. i never thought a game could be so addicting and fun. I'm so happy Im so happy I downloaded it.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I love a book that keeps me guessing right up to the end and this book certainly did just that!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I found this app very fun. It is very entertaining and enjoyable. I love this absolutely enjoyable and awesome game.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|If you have any sense of humor at all add this book to your reading list! So quirky and funny - the adventures are so outrageous I want them to take me along. The author makes even morbid subjects seem amusing, but not really disturbing. Another reader mentioned shades of Forrest Gump (maybe). The cast of characters has a style of their own and the only poignant moment comes nearly at the end. I won't give the ending away but I found it surprisingly sweet without being sappy. Not always laugh-out-loud hilarious, a more subtle style that just keeps you amused all the way through.
B008RTE08E|5.0|If your a beatles fan you will like the film and this DVD finally gives the film justice remastered and the sound is superb<br />the film is self indulgent and not well executed but its got beatle charm to it and the idea is brilliant (the coolest bus on earth) the footage is great and the music keeps it all interesting!! i am the walrus, blue jay way, fool on the hill, magical mystery tour!!!! the extras are all well worth the price of the dvd alone with alternate videos of blue jay way, fool on the hill and your mother should no!! it also has deleted scenes which are now gold!!!<br />we now need to have a dvd official release of let it be<br />and i would rather own mmt than ahdn or help anyday!!!!!!!!! gooo gooo ga joob ;)

B008YCMM2A|5.0|I'm 15 years old and an avid jazz lover. I currently play trumpet (jazz in particular) and I love listening to jazz musicians, Miles Davis being one of them. My father brought this home for me today as a gift and I must say it is really amazing. You get 3 CDs which equates to hours of music and it also includes a DVD Video featuring live performances (which I am watching right now). Very nice, worth the money if you're a jazz enthusiast like me.
0811870413|5.0|I love the bread at Tartine in San Francisco and was sad to leave the area. I wasn't sure if I could reproduce bread that was as delicious as the one made at the original bakery, but this bread baker has his recipe down to a science. If you're serious about bread baking, you should get this book. You will need a scale to measure your flour and water, and probably a thermometer, too, so get them if you're buying the book. The photos are gorgeous and help you get a sense of what your bread should look like. I also love the recipes in the back - there are great recipes for kale Caesar salad and other delicious treats using your homemade bread!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|cool game for a little kid that is young. But still it is fun for young people .! kool 3&times;for this horse game so far I have seen any other horse games
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I LOVE this game. I am an EXTREME horse lover and this game is perfect just for that. I DEFINITLEY recommend this game :-)
B0084AXZK0|5.0|I am enjoying the book.  Not finished yet.  it's very comfortable to use in bed.  Also enjoying being able to take with me.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is a sequel to the fast-paced, energetic, fun Temple Run. Although, not many character selections, this game has it all. Even a HUGE demon monkey!!! This is a game for children and adults who think active and creative . Anyone would love this game!
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect when I got the app, but I am glad that I did.  Offers a wide variety of choices and allows you to explore and select favorites. And it's free! I don't usually take the time to review apps but felt compelled to praise this one
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Very fun game. Addictive. Variety of things to do and settings. Love the range of horses and unicorns.<br />Especially good as it's free.
B005CRQ3RK|5.0|AWSOME because it so so so so funny I read it with may friends try 2read the third wheel . LOVE IT!!!!!!
B007BFSYMS|2.0|The sounds seemed like a good assortment and I might have enjoyed this app but after the first time I used it my phone crashed completely.  I'm not going to use an app that crashes my phone (Galaxy S) every time I use it.
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|Awsome I read almost all the books I can't wait to buy more. It is so AWSOME I want to read it again
B0094KF4WG|3.0|Not oo bad, a little shallow perhaps. Needs more intel background, would probably make a good action film though. Yada
B00AGKHEUI|5.0|This is perfection. Thanks for this FM! I am listening to this right now on Amazon Cloud Player while my cd is being shipped. sweet.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I came across this book on chance. I trusted the thousands of reviewers to decide on a book to help soothe my saddened soul. I do not know if it is soothed, but I do know that this is quite possibly one of my favorite books. Definitely in my top 5.<br /><br />Read it. You won't be disappointed.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I really love this game!!! the only problem I have is that when I use the &quot;save me&quot; option it totally crashes. Then when I logged back on it didn't even save my score! Yet it did manage to take away the gems. I was at 9 million..  and it crashed. Very disappointing.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|Couldn't put it down.  Read all three books in less then a week.  After I finished one book my husband started it.  We only have 1 Kindle so as we over lapped books I finished reading on my iPod!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This was a more realistic story compared to 50 Shades. I am a big fan of the Crossfire series and can't wait for the third book to be releases
B004INHTK4|4.0|This was a very interesting book.  I think any mother would admire how this Mother operates.  I don't know where she got the energy and patience from.  I am a perfectionist but I could never see myself behaving this way for the good of my family.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|Never got interested in the characters--didn't care if they died or not--except the main two. Do not care about reading the other two. Having a Book Review and I always like the book after we talk about it.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|STARS<br /><br />Waking Up Married is from the New series Harlequin Kiss. So far this is the first book I have read from the series. I am going to read more before deciding what if anything is different from this line of books.<br /><br />Waking Up Married is about two people that are scared to fall in love but want a family. They meet in Vegas and are drinking and talking. Next thing Megan knows she is waking up in a hotel room sick. Tossing everything she had and a ring on her finger. She doesn't remember much except meeting Connor and talking.<br />Megan says she wants a divorce.<br /><br />Connor did not realize how much she had drunk. He wants a family and not a love match. Megan had plans to be a mother through science. Connor than spends the next few months showing Megan how could a life they can have together.<br /><br />Megan finally is convinced and then Connor has doubts that Megan really knows what the real Connor is like.<br /><br />Thier is a lot of seductive action as Connor tries to use physical attraction to convince Megan about the future. Lots of love scenes. Megan and Connor have to face thier past relationship to find what they really need. Some humor.<br /><br />I was given this ebook to read and asked to give honest review when I was done by Netgalley.
B003UESJF6|4.0|This was a requested gift for my three grandsons.  They enjoyed it and laughed a lot. A fun video for them.
B00AESN8XY|4.0|This is a fun, addictive game that uses strategy to be able to stay one step ahead of science.  It would have been 5 stars, but I don't like that you either have to purchase mutations seperately or wait until you can beat the game on the medium level when that is so difficult.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This was the best diary of a wimpy kid I ever read thanks Jeff Kinney thank you a lot just thank you
B00274EYKY|2.0|washed up, broke, lives in a trailer that he can't afford, hooked on steroids, alienated his only child - this is a sad, slow moving, and predictable story.<br /><br />I did watch end-to-end but honestly, it wasn't worth my time.<br /><br />Wanna watch something from the same genre but much better? see Warrior
B006LSZECO|5.0|I could barely put my kindle down!  I highly recommend this book and the convience of the kindle version is a plus.
B003U6BE8I|1.0|This movie follows nothing of the book. I LOVE the Percy Jackson series!!!!!! But this is a bad movie even if it wasn't named Percy Jackson. THIS IS THE WORST MOVIE. If i could give it negative stars i would.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|this game is so fun. if you like to draw you will love this game it is definately a must get!!
B00AGOGOLE|1.0|Don't need to buy it. It doesn't do anything different than downloading free camera. No instructions on how to use. Would like to be able to take a regular picture
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is awesome!! I love it. it is so addictive. my friend wishes there was blood though. she loves happy poo.
B000N4SHOE|5.0|I can't imagine a better take on Beatrix Potter.  She was an intelligent and slightly quirky young woman ahead of her times.  I don't know if she really talked to Peter and Jemima and considering them her friends but I surely hope so.
B005HSL626|5.0|this game is so addictive!! I love this game. you don't have to buy anything with real money either. its awesome
1407121111|3.0|I bought this used and I didn't know that it would take as long but the book is really good and I would tell anyone to read this series.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|What makes this story compelling is the science Dr. Alexander uses to support his belief that his experience was a true NDE (Near Death Experience) and not a neurological response to physiological stimuli. However, I would have liked to to read more about the experience itself and the phenomena he encountered in the other reality. He claims that he received answers to all his questions and a fountain of knowledge, but he does not share that knowledge with the reader. His experience was also very different from the typical NDE I have read about, but he offers no explanation for that either. Perhaps, as he did state in the book, the English language limited his ability to describe the events. It left me somewhat unsatisfied, although it was an interesting read.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I love it its a short book but it was great I really enjoyed it I'll have to read the next ones
B000FC1MCS|5.0|Great book.  Very well written. I read it several years ago and it still sticks in my mind as a great book.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I use this game lots. It works well and is easy to play. Only thing I don't like is you can't win til cards are all played.
1457514508|4.0|I really liked this book! Fun fast paced thriller. I was hooked from the start.<br /><br />Engaging characters who kept the story popping! I love a bit of quirk in my mysteries and this one served it up so well. Rather like a dog lovers Desperate Housewives.<br /><br />Very nicely written tale. This is the first book for me by this author. I am definitely looking into more of his work. A very clever writer. I hope I smell a series!<br /><br />Cover Art - Not awful but not ringing my bell either!<br /><br />*ARC courtesy of the publisher via NetGalley in exchange for an honest review*
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This game has been played the most of any game I have downloaded. Responsive and works well. Nice game to pass time.
B000002J6H|5.0|I was pleased to get this remastered version.with a Jimi Hendrix solo on the track \\"Old Times Good Times\\",Blistering Guitar...wish the solo was longer.Eric Clapton jams and solo's on the track \\"Go Back Home\\" both songs are Ipod Worthy.

B007SGLZP8|5.0|As usual John Grisham delivers a captivating page turner! The Racketeer has it all...suspense, intrigue, action, and a plot that doesn't stop! I found myself turning off the television...and reading into the night!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think this is a good and fun horse game for horse lovers like me.  I think people who like horses should get this game.  It is fun.  It is like taking care of a real horse.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Kate Morton writes a wonderful tale, with many unexpected twists to the story.  The World War II stories are well-depicted.
0783229526|5.0|Not your average corney slap-happy comedy, twists and turns galore. This film is a creative genius and Depp is so awesome. If you don't pee your pants, there is something wrong with you.
B005R32L66|5.0|I just tried it on my google tablet and my android phone. It works great and the quality of the communication has greatly improved from the past versions.
B009E3EWPI|5.0|Great DVD and CD from the best rock group ever - this was a Christmas gift for my husband.  Really awesome music!!
B00004WNE4|5.0|This is an underrated piece of pop music. Among all the British Invasion bands of the 60s, very few had much staying power. Most were merely able to generate a few pieces of forgettable radio hits while being overshadowed by the likes of the Beatles and the Stones. But among the fray was the Zombies, a quintet from St. Albans, who were born to sing and write music. Colin Blunstone had the most angelic voice and was arguably one of the most talented front man vocalists of that era. He might not have had the showmanship of a Jagger or a Daltry, but he had a much stronger voice with an ear for pop zeal. Chris White was a brilliant, underrated songwriter. The songs are about love won, love lost, looking back on previous experiences from a wiser perspective, and being young. &#34;Time of the Season&#34; is the instant standout, but each song provides something rewarding to the listener. &#34;This will be our year&#34; is one of the greatest romantic pop songs ever written; &#34;Rose for Emily&#34; is a beautifully sung ballad by Blunstone; &#34;Care for Cell 44&#34; is an outstanding album opener. This album's stature has only grown in the years since its release, and it's no wonder why: it is a timeless treasure from the summer of love that featured the group at its zenith. The band split up in 1968, but this album remains their triumph. It may not be Pet Sounds or Sgt. Pepper, but it is indeed one of the strongest albums released from the 60s.
1451613512|5.0|Of course I am a hated progressive and I freely admit my inherent bias, otherwise known as the ability to think critically. It is tragic that so many of us are immersed in the view of exceptional America, the altruistic nation who only acts in decency and concern for humanity. While I am well read in various unsanitized versions of our history this book was enlightening in ways I could never had dreamt. Certainly Stone will be villified as will I for even daring to write this, but it is a true shame that we cannot look at our history dispassionately and discover that we are not just &#34;hated for our freedom&#34;. Highly recommend this work to those idealistic Americans who want to do right by the world. &#34;Those who do not know history are condemned to repeat it.&#34; (Edmund Burke)
B000UJCALI|5.0|I hadn't ever had the pleasure of seeing the Shining up until a couple of years ago. It had a good reputation but movies based on Stephen King books have a certain stigma attached to them that I am sorry to say I mostly find to be well-deserved. However, the Shining is different.<br /><br />Jack Torrance is a man who is looking for a change of scenery. It is hinted at that he has his share of demons that he is trying to escape. He gets a position as the winter caretaker for the grandiose Overlook Hotel, located deep in the mountains and inaccessible to most folk for about five months of the year. He and his family move in, but all is not well. The Overlook has some uneasy ghosts that have their own evil agenda, and Jack seems to be just the instrument of destruction they're looking for.<br /><br />Jack's son Danny is a special little boy who has psychic abilities, and the hotel wants him on its side. Can Wendy, Jack's wife, save her child and herself from the hotel - and her husband?<br /><br />The Shining is impressive on quite a few levels: there is an atmosphere of tension throughout the whole movie that really draws you in, the casting is excellent, wonderful performances are turned in by all, and though it was released in 1980 and the clothing and styles are definitely from that time, the picture holds up admirably, rarely feeling dated. This is a picture that a lot of the more recent horror/suspense films could learn something from. You don't need gratuitous sex and violence to make a good horror film, and a lot of gore won't cover up a lack of plot or forgetting to firmly establish the proper mood to scare the pants off your audience. Not to say that the Shining is devoid of sexual overtones and violence of any kind - because it isn't, this one is not appropriate for the children - but it doesn't throw them at you repeatedly to distract you from the fact that it sucks.<br /><br />If you've got any interest in being scared or you just want to see a really well-made film, watch the Shining. And for all you Stephen King fans who cringed at Christine, Sleepwalkers and the end of It, this one should be on your list.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a get-away.<br />It's well written and full of surprises. It's easy to relate to.<br /><br />My book club loved this book. It was good. I can't wait to read another book from this author.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I have a Samsung Galaxy S3. I've noticed when playing on both my phone and the new Kindle Fire that there is a lot of glitch. It's unbelievably aggravating to be within range of reaching a goal only to die because of a glitch. I appreciate the upgrades you guys have made to the game, it is so awesome. PLEASE, for my sanity fix the glitch problems. Anyone else experiencing this?
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Loved it! I fall more in love with each character each episode! Can't wait to catch up on the rest of the episodes!
B002M2T1RM|5.0|He is very honest and straight forward! Told me right away if i had trouble the dvd, to let him know! Not to much of that these days!
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|This book would make a great movie.<br /><br />Fast paced. An easy read.<br /><br />I will read others books by this team of authors.
B000ICXQXI|5.0|The slasher movie that all other slasher movies are judged by.  Hitchcock made a serious genre turn and created a new category of American movie.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|you have to be stupid not to get this game trust me I am telling you the truthit is so cool
B006OCM0G0|3.0|Initially this is a fun app to play - full of easy-to-reach levels that make the first few days seem rewarding.  But after closing down pop-up after pop-up, it's easy to reach the point where you just click quickly, and that is a mistake. It's ridiculously easy to accidentally purchase (yes, with real money) gems, and also ridiculously easy to spend gems (major gem purchases are not confirmed before being taken out of your account) .  Luckily, I turned off in-app purchases.<br /><br />Fixing these problems would make this a 5 star app (which is misleading to say in the description above - you cannot get above 4 stars in your restaurant rating.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I chose this because it is easy, all the interpretations were easily available, I can read offline and take notes. I also use it in church. When my Pastor makes a point about a scripture he read, I can make a note of it and save it to my kindle to study later.
B0042VJ1PI|4.0|I watch Castle all the time.  It is one ofmy favorite shows.  The book is like the show and I enjoyed reading it.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|I enjoy listening to all my favorite radio stations.  It works well with my kindle The sound is clear. I love it.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|'PASSIONE': I was a bit doubtful when I ordered this CD as it is not the kind of music I have ever really appreciated. But I decided to give it a try, and was pleasantly surprised - I love it! I have played it several times now, and it has proved to be the rare kind of album that gets better and better every time. Bocelli enthralls me with his interpretation of these love songs, many of which are new to me and which include some inspired duets with Jennifer Lopez, Nelly Furtado and the late Edith Piaf.<br /><br />There are few singers who can tackle Elvis Presley's music convincingly, but Bocelli can! His rendition of 'Love me Tender' is stunning, every bit as good as Elvis's own version, and sung with such simple sincerity and honesty - just beautiful.<br /><br />In 'Passione' Bocelli shows how versatile he has become as a performer and how much he has developed since his early 'Romanza' days. With his remarkable voice, which has got deeper, richer and more expressive over the years, he has produced one of his most interesting albums to date.
B00631HASU|4.0|Not very relaxing but fun to play.Good game to use to pass the time. My granddaughter loves to play too.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Finally it here!!!!! The sequel to the addicting first temple run!! I love the graphics and how we, the players, don't have to go straight anymore!!! Now they just have to make another one where we, the players, can make our own track and share it with our friends!!!!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My 10 year old loves it and occasionally I play it too! Very nice game great graphics. And it was easy to learn and no adds pop up!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is really one of the best games ever you should get temple run 2<br />You will love this game
B003Y74AZ2|5.0|Simple, well functioning design. Slim and easy to keep clean. You will love the grip and it keeps the phone in place, say on a dashboard.
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|I really like this book, I have really  liked every thing I`'ve read by Louisa may Alcott, I would also suggest reading eight cousins and rose in bloom, and an old fashioned girl
B00AMBK6J2|1.0|Don't waste your time. Don't know what Mark Wahlberg was thinking. No redeeming value but this was the unrated version. Doubt the rated would make it more worthwhile.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|The only thing I did not like was that it does not have search, I get tired of scrolling through the whole thing looking for one word. If you can search for the word, please show me how. Other than that, I thought it was great.
B008Z9YGEE|4.0|I'm in my 60's and thought: 'no way' but am glad I was the gazzilionth person to watch. Good story nicely done.
B008CPZNL6|2.0|This version makes me wish I had not surrendered my IPad to my wife. Crashes and the only fix is to reboot.
0984183523|5.0|I started my case practice with other case materials and books, but I always ended up getting \\"good but not there yet\\" feedback. After going through this book, the biggest advantage I got was understanding what every piece of case interview means. Why am I supposed to develop an hypothesis early? Why I need to be structured? Why unnecessary delving costs money or \\"job\\" in my scenario? and What it means to be a consultant? It really helped me to radically change my approach for case interviews. Instead of mindlessly doing tons of cases, I started spending more time on reviewing the case I did against the benchmark I developed after reading this book. Voila!! I \\"understood\\" what they look for in the interviews. Having a good business intuition and problem solving is one thing, but for a career switcher like me, understanding how to channel and highlight that talent in consulting world is a different beast altogether. If you are just like me then this is the first book you should start with if you decide to pursue consulting as a career. Mind you, this book doesn't have cases for you to practice, but it will provide you a good foundation to think in the right direction to approach a case.
B005LAII3A|1.0|I really regret this purchase. This was a sorrowful remake of the original Arnold Schwarzenegger film. And further, there was very little in common with the Philip K. Dick story. A total mess. Nonsense dialog, robotic actors, blah blah. It should never have been allowed to be sold on DVD!
B00B2V66VS|2.0|Well, the countinuously glitches on me... whenever I start playing, the screen gets all fuzzy on my NEW Kindle Fire HD with the camera. Not worth taking up space on my kindle...
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|Great movie.  Special effects were awesome.  The characters are either likeable or you like to hate them.  In the end, everyone gets what they deserve.  Karl Urban played it very close to Stallone.  Lena Headley was a bad bad lady.
B009NPA3Q4|4.0|Saw this guy on American Idol and immdiately got into his style of R&R music. Decided to buy the cd and wasn't disapointed. Cd flows nicely.
B009LDD1X0|5.0|As announced at Digital Bits, The Big Bang Theory: Complete Season Six, will be released onto DVD this coming 09-10-2013, and published by Warner Brothers. It's expected to be a box set, of the usual number of episodes onto the same familial number of disks (specifics not yet disclosed), and the SRP is yet to be revealed as well.  However, since I can't wait to place my pre-order, I hope that Amazon will make my dream come true (better sooner than later)...Penny..Penny.Penny !!!<br />Have fun in 2013 :) :) :)<br />JWC II

B008MG1E4A|5.0|Being the wife of a 30 year Master Warrant Officer, who spent over 25 of those years deployed overseas, I felt the book reflected the beliefs and dedication of our silent warriors.
0061122416|5.0|The Alchemist is an easy unexpected extremely well written book. After reading it, I had to read everything that he's written.  I took 11 minutes with me on a trip to Africa and was totally upset, I finished it on the plane on my way there, I couldn't sleep the story was so gripping.  His style is amazing.  After Malcom Gladwell, he's my favorite!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Imangi took a winning formula and made it even better.  The graphics are gorgeous, and the game play is very entertaining and addictive.
B005BRS8Z6|4.0|It's the kind of thing you already know, and it's written in very simple language.  It's also a very quick read, I'd recommend it. I want my daughter to read it.
082300659X|5.0|I just received this book yesterday.  I went through it last night and looked at every page, then read a couple of chapters.  This morning I watched the video.  It is all beautiful.  I am not an artist, but I have always wanted to draw.  At 61 I have amassed all the skills of a clumsy child.  But this woman's book explained in a very short time skills that seem understandable and attainable.  I highly recommend this book.  I think it would be worth the purchase if you are just a beginner, or someone with experience.  I am excited to give drawing another go.
B001IF252M|4.0|It's small, works fine, nothing wow, functional.  You might need an extender. I was able to connect my mac to the projector which is what I needed.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I am giving it 5 stars now....haven't even read it yet. Still on book 1 and I love it! Can't wait to order #3!
B009KS4XRO|2.0|I enjoy it, but wish it didn't have so many issues.  I have been booted, and frozen and lost my initial \\"purchase\\" of cards or haven't been able to collect my prizes.  I have been unable to play the daily tournament now for over 10 days although they claim to be working on it.  The problem is that is where you can get additional tokens or bingo credits.  After you've spent your initial credits you must wait up to 24 hours for 16 more.  As you get into more advanced rooms, that will only buy you one or two cards.  So basically you can only play one or two games a day for free at that point.<br /><br />My biggest complaint is in order to \\"complete a room\\" you must trade 2 \\"free gifts\\" with other players and you can only do that through facebook.  I, personally, do not wish to give out my personal information including my facebook page to people I meet in a bingo room on the web.  I would prefer there was a way to win all of the prizes in each room.<br /><br />I do have fun playing the game, but I do not like the idea that I can never complete a room without \\"friending\\" strangers through facebook.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I have been reading and enjoying every page of this book. Just ordered book #2 and will definitely order the 3rd!
B005H9B2CE|5.0|What else can I say.......Natalie Portman is exceptional as always. Action packed and great CG. Excellent movie for any collection.
B007B6VOG0|5.0|I have listened to this album several times. I love it. It is very catchy and definitely POP music but the lyrics are great and Nate Ruess has a great voice.
B005KAH7QU|5.0|Very engrossing and enjoyable. This movie is definitely worth watching. You won't be disappointed. Excellent acting and keeps you engrossed.
B009P0ZUJW|5.0|I have loved Grimaud's work for years. I'd never heard Sol Gabetta before this .. but I am looking forward to hearing more of her work.<br /><br />It is beautiful and I play it often.
B005JU5JEI|5.0|I really enjoy Cameron, she's a talented actress and this movie just shows how she can play different rolls and still be great.

030758836X|4.0|I was so excited that I had finally found a truly good, gripping book.  I stayed up late way too many nights because I could not put it down.  However, I was so disappointed with the way it ended, that I would never recommend it to anyone.  I give the author 4 stars for the first 99% of the book.  The last 1% .. two big fat thumbs down!
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I love it!!!!!!!!  it is so amazing and  I thought that the movie was good . And I love  way you combined 3 books into one!But will there be any more books????!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|i Love it best horse game i have been on in quite awhile different actions on looking after horses the best
B009MCRHH6|4.0|Played this game before on the PC and the Android version plays great. Only drawback is it is a bit tricky to play with your finger (rather than the mouse on the PC). Kind of difficult to get that exact positioning where you want it (because your finger is on top of the 'goo' piece you are trying to place. Can't see thru your finger.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Loved the trilogy.  Different, engaging & provoking.  Well written.  You can't help but be pulled in to the saga and route for the good guys!
B00992CF6W|5.0|minecraft is about the best game in the intire world . I have been wasting sooooooo loooonnnnnggggg!!!!!!!!!!!! I love it I love it!!!!!!!!!
B002361MLA|1.0|I've tried reading this book.... twice.  The only reason I give it one star is that zero stars aren't an option.  People rave about Eckhart Toile but I simply don't see the attraction.  His views weren't life changing or new in my opinion.  I found it tedious & boring.
B009RI4FRU|4.0|A sweet and romantic tale with just the right amount of quirkiness.  The movie was about 90 minutes long and the time flew by. Moonrise Kingdom is a &#34;Fargo light&#34;.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I was totally drawn into this creative and unexpected book.  It is a great story and a thoroughly enjoyable read.  I highly recommend it!

B0010SEMP0|3.0|The second book in the Night Huntress series wasn't as good as the first one. The story almost seemed to be rushed. Other than that it was good. You get to learn more about Bones in this one and I love Bones he's my second favorite character.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|A little overwhelming with the scenery... It's a fun game, a nice extension of the original, but might be better suited for a tablet than a phone.
B001MSMULG|4.0|The book was very  good.keep you on the edge of you set.the kill  artist. Would tell allowing friends about it
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|The Merriam-Webster app for Kindle Fire is very convenient especially when you don't want to lug a heavy dictionary around.  It's great when you are reading on the Kindle Fire and you need to look something up.  I definitely recommend this to heavy Kindle Fire users.
0805047905|5.0|I received this in a very timely manner, and it was very well packaged. I love that it is a board book, which is great for durability and little hands. The story itself is one I would consider a classic children's story. It makes great use of visual clues, and word/picture association.
B009U9S6FI|5.0|I have yet to read the book. Nevertheless, I have listened to a recent local live interview of him. This man has insight to life to offer those of us searching for meaning when faced with emptiness and misery.

B0002KVUKM|5.0|Great movie, no problems. I especially like the bonus features. This was a good deal and I would recommend it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this was an awesome game. I recommend that you buy. in my opinion it is better than the first game.
B00AECGQF2|1.0|Pay WAY TO MUCH 3 to much for bad app that's not fair don't waste your hard earned money because you will be posting comments with1 star wish I could give it no stars it is that bad the point is don't waste time or money on this app

B008673ZAQ|4.0|I enjoyed this book - it's not an earth shattering novel - but a nice, easy vacation read.  I will definately get the next book when it becomes available.

B003VANOFY|1.0|I have both the G35 and the G930 headsets. I will state that from the previous el cheapo gaming headsets I had used, they were a massive step up. I have some great sein's for cans for music, but until Logitech came out with these, there was nothing at all available for gaming that was good. I got the original G35's when they had massive software and driver problems. Some of which still persist today. Oh which I'll go over shortly.<br /><br />So for over a good year I owned the G35's and they performed well. Comfortable, better sound for gaming headsets than anything previously, AND didn't have a mic that tends to snap off easily. Nor was the mic a piece of crap that makes you sound tinny or garbled. I had owned several Plantronic and cheaper Logitech gaming headsets that had massive problems with mics. They almost always invariably snapped off after awhile. It wasn't anything excessive to do it, just repositioning of the mic several times everyday while wearing them is enough to break mics off most headsets. These were the first solid pair I had. The only problem with the G35's was the nylon wrapping around the cord. It twists CONSTANTLY. The twisting motion will cause the cord to bound upon itself. Eventually it will twist up tight enough to split the nylon. It happened after a year of usage. Not wanting to further damage the G35's, I thought to look around and see what was out there. I saw the G930s were coming out soon, so I went back to a cheap $10 pair for the interim which broke right as the G930's came out.<br /><br />I bought the G930's. I loved how much lighter they were compared to the G35s. They sounded just as good, although good sound reproduction or even better sound reproduction was starting to come from competing headphones in the gaming arena finally around this time. I enjoyed the headphones immensely when they were released. However, it was not all milk and cookies. There were problems with driver stability, compatibility problems with the Logitech software with games, and many times the button customizations for the buttons on the ear piece would not work. Just like the G35. I could deal with it, and eventually many of those issues were solved. I could use a button on the side and program it to activate push to talk in most VOIP programs like ventrilo, mumble, or team speak. It was great if you had to take a break from a group raid while getting a drink in the kitchen. I could hear when others were coming back from their breaks and make it back to the game without wasting time. All while still being able to hold a conversation with those on the VOIP channel that didn't get up to take a break.<br /><br />Still, there were occasional compatibility problems that occurred. One that STILL occurs is with adobe flash. Sometimes you only get sound from Logitech headphones through the right ear. It is a known bug and has been around for a LONG time. There are work arounds like turning some of the sound enhancements on and off. Annoying to deal with but I could do it and did. Again, there wasn't much in the way of competition for these headphones.<br /><br />However, after 8 months, what I dreaded would happened finally did. The micro USB port on the headphones for charging worked loose and now will not charge the battery in the headphones. They have become an expensive paperweight. I babied these headphones too like the G35's. Never slammed them down, had a homemade hook I put on the wall near my computer desk to keep them safe when I was done with them. I never pulled on the cord or did anything that would cause excessive strain on these.<br /><br />So I resorted back to the G35's. I had been using those again for another 8 months when the plastic that holds the cans to the band cracked on the left earphone. The part where the cans are attached to the headband is just a very TINY thin piece of plastic that allows the headphones to swivel a bit. This is a massive material failure piece in both the G35 and G930 headphones. It's not a matter of if this will break but WHEN it will break. On top of that, the faux leather lining around the foam padding on both headsets had started to flake off after about 6 months of usage. It's almost completely worn off the G35's before they snapped.<br /><br />I will say this, while I was happy with my time when I owned them, I would not purchase either the G35 nor the G930 again in their current incarnations. Unfortunately there still is not a whole lot of competition for gaming headsets like these. So right now I'm back to el cheapos that I hope will last a year between purchases. To me I rather spend $20 or less on a pair of gaming headsets that I know will last about a year versus $100+ for a pair that will last the same time frame. Sure the sound quality, mic quality, and fun features of the Logitech headsets will not be matched by an el cheapo pair, but I don't consider it worth my money any more for something that will break in a year or so.<br /><br />Here's hoping that Logitech either comes out with a Gen 2 that fixes the problems of the current G35/G930 lineup, or the competition finally comes out with something better. For reference I have tried them all. Plantronics, Corsair, Razor, and Soundblaster for high end gaming headsets. I've tried all that they have offered. None of these companies have yet to put out a solid gaming headset that is comfortable, provides great sound, great mic, great feature setup (like programmable buttons), AND has quality durability. They all suck in the later department of durability, and most of the others lack in the other areas.

B008476HBM|4.0|A classic I just read for the first time. I can see why it's a classic!<br />I'm sure I'll be reading it again.
B005FISBTO|4.0|I was HIGHLY disappointed in Season 5.  I thought it in no way lived up to the standards of Seasons 1-4 and I ended up skipping this season because of it.  Season 6 hits all the right marks.  Great villians, great story arch, NO ANNOYING LOVE INTEREST, and a great ending.  As people can probably tell from my capitalized complaint, my least favorite seasons are, in order: 5,7, and then 2.  Rita is the only woman whose presence didn't annoy the crap out of me.
B001J20ZIA|5.0|Our granddaughter requested the rental.  It seems that bullying is covered in her first grade class and she heard some of her friends saw it.
B006JSXYPA|5.0|This was part of a Christmas gift for my 9 year old transformer junkie grandson - he loves it and is very happy with his grandparents for getting something he really wanted.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Ok, the techno-thriller is a bit hackneyed these days but I love Clancy and delving the depths of the cyber world and the Cinese anti-carrier missile were fascinating.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|great game. my 6 and 7 year old loves to take care of the horse. they really enjoy the games too.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|The characters in the book become very real.  No one is perfect.  The idea of great loneliness and longing for community is clearly revealed.  The story drops in on two individuals, one  a man and one a woman, who are coping with the fact of living alone after having company of elderly relatives for years.  Both struggle to get out of depression. Both struggle with the idea of dating. There is a wonderful surprise ending that gives a satisfying conclusion to the book.<br />This story will haunt you for some time, and make you more aware of the lonely people all around you.
B005IQZB14|5.0|This is by far the best book I read in 2012. It was really refreshing to read something that was very entertaining and at the same time helping me to grow. You will laugh and cry as you go along on Cheryl's journey with her.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Great continuation of the story.  Held my interest and had a hard time putting it down.  Highly recommend this book.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|Very deep and emotional book. Enlightening and joyous. This book answered so many questions and brought up many new ones. I highly recommend it.
0452287022|5.0|I bought this book for school because I had a class the required it. That's about it, Three more words required...hah
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I really enjoyed this game..it was challenging without being so hard that I couldn't go to the next step..  the story plot was interesting and I am looking forward to the sequel.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|This book is about 17 yr old Sky who has the perfect life, sheltered but perfect or the closest thing to it. Sky passes time with her best friend Six eating ice cream, watching movies, oh and sneaking  boys through her window and making out with them. But it's only for their benefit she doesn't feel anything for or from the guys EVER. Until she sees Holder and everything in her life changes forever. This is such a nice read to me I love the friendship between Sky and Six. They are truly how best friends should be. Holder was giving me an headache with his mood swings and also I don't blame Sky. I would think he really is a stalker too with all this info he knows about her w/o her ever telling him. But, it will all make sense once everything &#34;comes out in the wash&#34; so to speak. I enjoyed the book but I will admit that the 3-4 pages spent solely on making out scenes did become a bit much to me. But overall the book was a good book and I enjoyed it! I read this in two days so I say get the book. <br /><br />Sent from my iPad2
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Really nice app. Love it for when I'm bored. Wish there was more to do on it though. Graphics are great, doesn't crash or freeze, and let's you customize your horse, fun fun fun!
B000SCHBGQ|5.0|i hade got this book over a week ago and was instanly hooked. At first i didnt know what to expect but as i started reading it i couldnt put it down i just reacently finished the series so ya all in all great book
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love it, it's a amazing game and I love to play it just wish you could actually ride the horse
B006OCM0G0|3.0|This app. Is fun and addictive but has some draw backs when you try to close to get food made up ahead it still gets ate so there is no getting ahead.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I'm somewhat &#34;new&#34; to the Sci-Fi/ Fantasy style books, (not new to reading in general by any means), and I thought that the &#34;Song Of Ice And Fire&#34; series was as good a place as any to start out. I would definatley reccommend reading it, but it you're just starting Sci-Fi/Fantasy books like I was, you should start out with something a little bit more light. And I don't mean figuratively either. The book is LONG. Maybe not long as compared to other books of this genre, but long nontheless. If you do decide to read it, have the next book close in hand for when you finish ;)
B002NANLCE|5.0|This book is a great perspective on time.<br />Worth every penny spent to purchase it.<br />- breath taking - .
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Well written, just as the previous book. I loved this one just as much as the first. I look forward to reading the next one, but for now I'm giving myself some time to read some other books ;) They're just so looonnnng :P Maybe not for some of you, but hey, it was worth it.
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|Any parents worst nightmare! It's a Must read, to understand how strong and brave a little girl could be in a time like that. Happy ending!!!!!!,

B000YH6YG8|5.0|This movie should be on the 'must watch' list for everyone.  It shows the anatomy of hate groups, why people are sucked into them, how a person can learn to step out of the hate.  Edward Norton is a genius, and portrays the almost psychotic zealot to the letter, while showing the 'redeemed' Derek just as well.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I recommend this book to everyone looking for a book to read. Someone that loves Nicholas Sparks books. He never fails me with his extraordinary writing. Never was there a time where I wanted to put this book down. It took me three days to read, because that's how much I was into it. I for sure had to give this book a five star!
B00A4FOWYQ|5.0|I'll be honest- \\"The Con\\" is one of my favorite albums of all time. When it was released, I listened to it constantly, and when I wasn't listening to it, I was thinking about it. The documentary that was released along with it made me love the songs and the album even more. It almost felt like I was in high school again, having an album I loved so much that I was able to sit and listen to it and *that* was enough. It's been a long time since any music felt that way and not much has come out since that does the same thing for me.<br /><br />And then, \\"Sainthood\\" came along and it took some adjusting to. I almost felt alienated by it the first time I listened to it, but it grew on me. Not like some of T + S's earlier music, but it wasn't as jarring as I first thought. But it never felt 100% right.<br /><br />\\"Heartthrob\\" is another adjustment. It definitely puts Sainthood in perspective, sort of like they were testing the waters with Sainthood and with Hearthrob they are diving right in. Like I said, this isn't some long awaited follow up to some of Tegan and Sara's earlier acoustic music. It's definitely part of the evolution in their sound that they've been doing the last few years. But Tegan and Sara are smart, they are talented, they are creative, and they are clever and their music is thoughtful, so it would almost be tragic if their sound didn't evolve along with them.<br /><br />Overall, \\"Heartthrob\\" is a super interesting and *catchy* album. It feels like there is a tremendous amount of new wave influence in the songs (I guess I am showing my age writing that) but it's all put together in a really brilliant way. And in the midst of all the electronics and catchy choruses, I'll hear something very \\"trademark\\" to Tegan and Sara's sound in the songs and I'll get the chills and sort of see the brilliance in it all. The yearning vocals, the clever lyrics, the honesty... presented in this really curious group of songs that I'm still mulling over even after hearing the album several times.<br /><br />I think this is one of those albums you fall in love with over several listens rather than *seeming* brilliant on first listen but then getting dull very quickly. The thing is, each time I listen to the whole album from start to finish, I want to hear it again and again just to figure it all out.<br /><br />If I had to describe \\"Heartthrob\\" in three words, I think I'd choose modern, vulnerable, and (a bit) eerie. Like I said, it's an interesting collection of songs. There's definitely something there that really captivates me and makes me want to keep listening to it before I make that decision.<br /><br />The honest truth is I'd listen to T+S sing the phone book, but I prefer them on their game. I think that \\"Heartthrob\\" is a great contribution to their discography. It's definitely not what's expected of them by many, but there's nothing sacrificed either.<br /><br />If you are a die hard T+S fan, you'll probably love it. If you are a die hard \\"The Con\\" or \\"So Jealous\\" fan, and wanting more of that, you probably will not find exactly what you hope for in this group of songs. But it's definitely worth a listen to see if something resonates. Overall, I'm thrilled to have a new set of T+S songs to obsess over.he album several times.<br /><br />I think this is one of those albums you fall in love with over several listens rather than *seeming* brilliant on first listen but then getting dull very quickly.

B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I love this game. I go back and challenge myself to better my time. It takes concentration and a good way to zone out. I would recommend this game.
B003XRELGQ|5.0|Great book and for a great price. I recommend the Cat's Cradle on Kindle version. I never read Kurt Vonnegut book before and this is a good start for anyone who wants to delve into this venerated satirist.

B005OP7162|5.0|This is a great series,  and keeps you watching to see how Emily (a.k.a Amanda Clarke) weaves her way through the information in her father's journals to write the wrongs done to her family.  Great acting by Emily VanCamp, Joshua Bowman and Madeleine Stowe.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|the best game to play for a horse lover. my kid loves it so much he wastes my battery every time
B005XN31LY|5.0|I haven't watched from the beginning.  Just started but got hooked quickly.  Great series... can't wait for more to come.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple Run 2 is better than the first. The graphics are fantastic, everything seems so realistic, and overall it's a great game. The only problem is that sometimes when I play one game it lowers my coin total. First I had 3,101 coins, now I have 854 and I didn't even buy anything. But other than that I love this game with a capital L!!!
B000PAAH3K|5.0|gives you a whole new way of looking at the world  AND  that can't be all bad! try it out and see for yourself.
1439196834|2.0|Love the book, but shipping took forever! Longer than the expected delivery date. Got this for my SO's birthday and it ended up as his Christmas present instead. Great book though! Any HIMYM fan will love this! Every play is in here, except for the most recent one from Season 8 (I won't spoil the surprise!).
B00AZVAE1E|3.0|The Sherlock Holmes of Conan Doyle's authorship can be updated, and made good television, but the Brits are better at it.  Probably because they understand the main characters more than American writers and actors do.  Sherlock Holmes was not quite so scientific, he tended to disappear for days at a time, returning in disguises so well executed that Watson couldn't see through them.  He would be discovered in an opium den by an astonished Watson who entered himself expecting to only find a man he treated as a patient.  In Modern NYC it could be a homeless community living in a subway tunnel. Holmes used his disguises in waterfront pubs, among the criminal element that hated and feared him, and he was consulted by royalty from across the world, in great confidence.  The possibilites are so limited as this first season has been written, I only wish the writers involved to take the time to understand a character who was the Harry Potter of that generation, and usually nothing like any American movie or TV series made of him.  The best actual portrayal you are ever likely to see would be the Jeremy Brett 'Sherlock Holmes' from Granada TV, and PBS fame.<br />As is so often the case American TV lacks adequate 'Imagination' in its creations, and they limit their actors to stale characters by handicapping them that way.  I think this show has real potential, but it needs more Sherlock in its portrayal of 'Holmes'.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|This book is interesting, The author gets a little wordy at times.  It's a feel-good book so far.  At times I can not put it down.
B00B2G2RG6|4.0|The dark storyline is well written and acted, but too violent and psychologically disturbing for kids.  Should be a big hit.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|Great album, like any other Bocelli album.<br />I am a big fan and Im only 18, this is real music
B000JMKQX0|4.0|It was an interesting way to present the story. Really looking forward to the movie.  The story wrapped up well.

B000I9YWZ2|4.0|This is a great movie. Would have prefered to be able to watch it for a longer period of time.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Well this is my first read of 2013, and I must say it was a fantastic start.  I don't often read non-fiction but I'd like to change that. I very much enjoyed this book and one reason was because I knew it was a true story. No Easy Day: The Firsthand Account of the Mission That Killed Osama Bin Laden<br /><br />All the names are changed in the book,  including the author's,  so we don't know who he really is, but the author was one of the members of SEAL Team Six, or DEVGRU.  This team was primarily responsible for carrying out the raid on bin Laden. The author takes us through his history in the SEALs and some of the training he endured, along with a few previous missions in which he was involved prior to the bin Laden raid. If you enjoy stories about Navy SEALs then you'll like this book. After reading this, I'm planning to pickup some more books about the SEALs and about military history also.<br /><br />This story is not for the faint of heart. It deals with real warfare and might offend some people who are bleeding hearts. But it is realistic and does an excellent job of portraying the necessities of guns, war, the need for our military and especially our Navy SEALs, along with showing the best and probably only way to deal with terrorists and those who would threaten the United States and its citizens.<br /><br />The author wrote under the name Mark Owen, but says that isn't his real name.  He also changed names of all his buddies in the book, to protect the SEALs identities.  In the epilogue of the book, he gives his reasoning for why he decided to write this story and basically says that since his Commander in Chief, meaning Obama as President, has decided to talk about these events in open public, he sees no problem with doing this himself, being one of the men directly involved in the mission.  He was tired of seeing the news reporting and public internet accounts of the mission, because he said most of them had erroneous information and didn't tell the true story of the raid.  His intention was to set the record straight, and I think he does a fine job in this piece of literature.e story of the raid.

B007UZO3F6|5.0|the 500W powersupply will run a top tier card (one with dual 8 pin power!), the case is cramped but all accessible.
B000FCK65W|5.0|I hated to have it end. It was a genuine story of American life in the early 20th century, people rising out of poverty.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|Contrary to what I thought I was getting into, A Feast for Crows isn't the whole book.  No it is half of the stories in the Song of Ice and Fire world based on where the characters are geographically.  Unsurprisingly Martin's tale is full of deep intrigue and the true grit of what it would have been like to life in a time where men, and one woman in particular, lived and died by the sword.
B009HXG9UQ|5.0|Quirkymovie, reminiscent of &#34; The Incredible Mr. Fox&#34;. We laughed through the whole movie! Excellent acting, too. I would watch it again and again!
B003JTHWJQ|5.0|More so than anything I've read, Ricard Dawkin's book has opened my eyes to the wonders of living without religion.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|A bit off color, but incredible music and great dialogue. Fun for teens especially! One we would watch again and again.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I contacted Gameloft after the FIRST time the game reset. I had only been playing for a week or so, and was only at level 16 or so. That was almost three weeks ago. I was told that \\"because the data is saved on the device we cannot reset the game for you.\\" Well, now the game has reset AGAIN. This time I was at level 29 with tons of houses, businesses, animals, etc. I have emailed them again, but I hold no hope for any assistance. It is a very fun game, when it works, but be prepaired for it to crash. I have now uninstalled them game from my phone. I will soon uninstall it from my daughters Kindle because her version crashed a few days ago.

0345803507|1.0|I am completely amazed there are so many of my friends telling me that they want a Christian Grey in their lives.  Do you know this is exactly what violent and angry men do??  They start out being obsessed with you, they adore you, you are their world  and then slowly they start creeping up on your life and controlling it in ways you did not think were possible.  It might be so many different ones, they dont want you to be out with your friends, they control your finances, they dont want you to study, to have a career, to work and the list goes on. They are totally about you at first.  You are the only woman in the world who truly understands them because all the others were just like Cruela De Vil.  You become the center of HIS UNIVERSE.  I have to admit it is very heady at first to have someone so completely in love with you but please WAKE UP!!  Recognize the signs before it is too late.  If we fast forward this book 10 years I guarantee Christian will be violent to Ana in some way.  Please read[[ASIN:0425191656 Why Does He Do That?: Inside the Minds of Angry and Controlling Men]] the book by Lundy Bancroft so you can read the signs before it is too late and read something like[[ASIN:0988262606 The Goddess Letters]] so we can raise the vibration of this planet and we can truly initiate something beautiful for all the women in the world.  Lets elevate the female principle to what it should be, its equal complement to the male principle.

B0017I1IZA|4.0|Janet Evanovich entertain her reader once again with bounty hunter Stephanie Plum's silly predicaments. As she continues to struggle with her romantic feelings for two men, she searches for a mother and daughter who have disappeared.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is fun because you get to unlock cool things and you also get to make family's and buy stuff.
B004EPYZV2|5.0|I have to say I wasn't expecting much when I went to see the new Mission Impossible movie. I liked the 3rd but I wasn't blown away with it. However, something was done in right in Ghost Protocol. In it we find that Ethan Hawke and his team are in essence framed, which in turn makes the US seem like the bad guys, and they have to do the impossible to prove otherwise.<br />I have to say I really liked Tom Cruise in this 4th installment. I found him much more humble and not as cocky as in his other movies. Also, I enjoyed the sarcastic remarks, it made the movie seem more realistic among all the unrealistic stunts.
B005FISBTO|5.0|Love me some Dexter! I hate how the season ended because I have to wait until Season 7 comes out on DVD...ugh. Don't do this to me Showtime :-)<br /><br />DO NOT WATCH THE PREVIEWS AT THE BEGINNING OF THE DISCS IF YOU DON'T WANT TO SEE THE LAST 5 SECONDS OF THE SEASON FINALE!!!<br /><br />One of my favorite parts of Season 6 was when Dexter was dancing to \\"Can't touch this\\" at his high school reunion.....puts a smile on my face just thinking about it.<br /><br />I ordered seasons 1-6 and watched them all in a little under 2 weeks. Now I am having Dexter withdrawls. Hurry up and come out Season 7!!
B008476HBM|5.0|Doesn't matter how many times I read P&P I never get tired of it, it's still the best!  Perfect example of true romance, will always be a must read. Many people opt for just watching the movie however, i recommend you give the book a chance and read it least once, it will not disappoint!!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|My wife loves this series.  She convinced me to watch season 2 and I have enjoyed the 6 episodes I have seen so far and I will watch more.  Good Stuff
B0011UJMK2|4.0|Once I started this book, I read it very quickly. Interesting insight on the culture of the time. A little disappointing in the end but overall very good.

B007UWH3O2|5.0|If you are a fan of ever changing, new, and different music by the same artist(s), then Storm Corrosion is for you. If you want the same sound, it is not. I absolutely love this release and listen to it frequently. It is like nothing Steven or Mikael have ever done while still retaining a sliver of their respective styles.<br /><br />I hope they return in the future with another collaboration.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Definitely a different book than I've ever read before. Interesting twists and turns that kept me turning the page late into the night. Can't wait for Gillian's next one!

B000IZXR7U|4.0|I LIKE TURTLES. And Mad Max. Excellent movie. I like very much. I love him. And the bad guy was good in Farscape.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|After the reading the last book in the 50 shades trilogy I was extremely disappointed. I agree all three books were poorly written, but the excitment and the suspense between Ana and Christian you continue reading. The first book grabs you with the raw details of the relationship between those two, the second makes your heart melt for the sexy Christian but the third book jumps from one to another scene. It seems the author ran out of ideas with the third book. I would recommend the first and second book but not the third is not worth the ten dollars. The second book should have been the ending to the series.
0547848412|5.0|What more could you want from a book? Ok, more than just two characters maybe, but you don't need that when you've got Pi living three different religious lives.<br /><br />Here is a tale of a young kid who is moving from India to America with his family when the ship wrecks and leaves him stranded on a tiny raft with a massive Bengal tiger. Learning to live on the raft with this lion proves to be a life threatening task and a humorous endeavor for young Pi. Eventually he is able to figure out a few tricks and solutions to his problems, but they don't come easy, and watching him learn the hard way ends up being quite funny.<br /><br />Pi is also faced with the moral decision of deciding whether or not he should try to kill the tiger or keep his only companion alive for some much needed company in the middle of the ocean. The debate goes on in his head over and over. What would you do?<br /><br />This was one of those books that I couldn't wait to finish, but once I got to a certain point I began reading slower because I didn't want it to end. You know, the ole, I want to read this book, but I want to savor it syndrome. Never a bad syndrome to have.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor, buy this book, and never watch the movie. It is doesn't even compare.

B008JFUTT0|5.0|Rodriguez was a folk music genius and his music/message almost slipped past the world unnoticed. Thank God it didn't though.<br /><br />Like all great prophets and brilliant people, he needed to be heard. Luckily, miraculously, he was heard. And he was heard by exactly the right people at the right time. It is stories like this that make you believe in a greater force in the universe. One that makes things happen when they need to happen, and as subtle as that force may be at times, it truly is magnificent and inspiring.<br /><br />Rodriquez was a Detroit musician during the 60's. During that time he cut two albums that were expected to make a big splash in the industry, but ended up fizzling out. Although the producers and people on the Detroit music scene thought he was going to be the next big American rock star, it never developed. Well, not in the states at least.<br /><br />Through a series of incredibly hard to believe coincidences, a bootlegged copy of his album Cold Fact made it's way to South Africa, wound up all over the radio, and against all odds ended up being inspiration for a social uprising in South Africa. Rodriguez's music and message was all about rebelling and going against the grain. At the time, that was what the people of South Africa needed.<br /><br />Overnight Rodriguez became a mysteriously popular rock star. No body in South Africa knew him, they didn't know where he lived, and had no idea where the music came from, but he grew to be bigger than the Stones, bigger than Elvis, and bigger than the Beatles in South Africa. To them he was a musical God and was the best that had ever lived. \\"Jimi who?\\"<br /><br />Urban legends began spreading and rumors grew about the myth that was Rodriguez. The only theory that ever seemed plausible to them was that Rodriguez had died. This was the album he made right before he died and that was it. For a few fans though, this wasn't enough. They needed to know about Rodriguez's life and who he was. They didn't settle for anything but the truth, and this documentary is their wonderful search for the musical God of their life. Their search, for the Sugar Man.dn't settle for anything but the truth, and this documentary is their wonderful search for the musical God of their life. Their search, for the Sugar Man.

B003A4IFGY|5.0|You will NOT regret this purchase! Beautiful and bluesy, this is a great addition to your collection! Definitely buy it!
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|This novel captures the reader's interest from the word go but fails to maintain it.<br />The story meanders somewhat and at times stretches credulity.
B001AH6ZWY|4.0|I have always loved this movie and the Blu-Ray version is fantastic! Though a little bit of artifacting can be seen as a result of the upscaling of the movie, overall its not terribly distracting and the audio is great (at least on my 2.1 sound system).<br /><br />If you love this movie, I recommend adding the Blu-Ray version of it to your library!
B007VUCAVO|5.0|I like being in control of my equipment and this app is the most useful tool I have for my kindle fire hd. Everyone should be using it.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|I love Jodi Picoult's book. She captures you in from the first page. The beginning of the story amazes me that I can be so attached with the characters so, so quickly!!
B008NC1LJ6|2.0|When a movie has a great cast we have a right to expect a movie to match.  This didn't come close.  It may seem interesting to create a story showing how lives interconnect etc.  But the script in this movie just doesn't amount to much.  The film aspires to be thought provoking and/or profound but I found it just provoking.  Why did I waste the time.  A few good scenes - Anthony Hopkins at an AA meeting etc.  But overall I found this to be a pretentious flop.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I loved it, I'm sure it's not for everyone, but it has got a lot of depth that comes out as the story continues.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is a good game and is described well in the App Store. It is not overly difficult as yet. I hope it gets more so as I reach higher levels.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Just love everything about this show - the show and everyone on it should get awards. That's all I have to say.
B000FC1CYG|5.0|An intriguing tale that kept me turning the pages.  What delightful characters Mr. Collins brings to life through his pen.  There is a reason this book is considered one of the \\"classics\\".
B00A0SKFLG|3.0|This remake was okay, but not as well written and as much of a joy ride as the original, but I do think Colin is a pretty good actor
B00013RC8O|1.0|This DVD would not play in the UK - it says 'wrong region'.<br /><br />Very disappointing - it should have said this when I bought it,<br /><br />Not happy!!!
B007PS0DTI|5.0|This one was very good, because I missed Kate in the last Underworld version. This would have been a whole better if Scott Speedman had come back. It will be interesting to see if there are anymore Underworlds, and if so will the real Scott return and not the fake one in this one here.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is so fun i just love it is a great great game for everone i just love it
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Nicholas Sparks fans here's another of his perfectly charming writings!  The human touch with carefully drawn characters, a slice of life story, and the intrigue to keep you reading until the very end!

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love this show.  The mannerisms and the subtleties are wonderfully done. I am totally addicted and will be devastated when I am done with season three.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This trilogy blew me away. It gives you so much to think about. The parallels to today's world are brilliant. A must read!

B00095NX9G|5.0|This is everything I could have asked for! The dvd was in excellent shape. (Although one of the dvd holders didnt hold the dvd in very well) Very happy with my purchase.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app so much. You never get tired of it and it always gives you something to do. Love it. This is one of the best apps i've had.
B00A9C3RB8|3.0|Still can't get over seeing Meryl on her knees in a movie theatre.  It was worth watching but would not have wanted to pay for it at the movies
B003JTHXOK|5.0|By far one of Nicholas Sparks best!  I thought Lucky One was good until I read this!  Well worth the price.
0743243153|5.0|I couldn't believe I waited so long to read this book, but also very lucky to have finally finished it. It is by far the best self-radiance book. It shows how to love yourself, thru which you know how to love life and other people around you. I would recommend it to anyone who is struggling in relationship, confidence, life direction. And I wish more work done in this area. The  world will be much better while everyone focuses on self-growth, knowing to be independent and reliable at the same time. There is nothing more important than to be responsible for your own in one's growth.<br />I will revisit the book very soon, or anytime I feel struggling again.
B004HO6I4M|5.0|I loved this movie and was happy that I was finally able to purchase it. Sometimes my roommate and I watch this movie 5 times a week. Bored maybe but we both liked it that much. Excellent animation and storyline.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|In my opinion this is by far Nicholas Sparks' best book. Don't get me wrong I love a good ole romantic love story but they can get dry, boring, and predicable after a while. This book is definitely not typical. I'd say it's a romance/thriller book which means you won't be able to put it down! All that to say it's a great book! I'm interested to see how the move turns out...cause in my opinion the book is always better:)<br /><br />One last note, as others have said don't read the end page or ending of the book before you start the first chapter (I know people who do that) because it will ruin everything for you.
B002RKSZS0|3.0|An interesting look at the customs of the day, but not a page-turner. No climax to speak of. Yet I do still love the challenge of reading Austen's works and will continue to do so.
1423140605|4.0|The Heroes of Olympus saga continues and in what a way. This story brings both the Greek and Roman sides of mythology together. All the characters you've come to know are here and are on quite an adventure to stop the Titans.<br /><br />The book cover is just as vibrant looking as you see in the picture. Perhaps a little bit more so. I know you're wondering why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. The reasons are only minor. As good as the cover looks for some reason it can start to feel very clammy and attracts things on it. Be prepared to wipe it down from time to time. The only other thing is I noticed quite a few typos while reading, but it's pretty minor for me.<br /><br />This is a good adventure story for pre-teen readers and up. I've always been fascinated with mythology themes especially growing up watching Hercules and Xena: Warrior Princess. It's a good read overall.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It helps me get my mind off of things. Way better than the first one. I love the app and give it 5 stars
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|I haven't really kept up with Seth McFarlane's shows and wasn't sure how I would like this movie. But have heard enough good things about it (plus McFarlane's hosting the Oscars) that curiosity got the better of me. I have to say I really enjoyed it. I thought the humor was nice and dry, while really getting to the point. Mark Walhberg played to type and the bear well. Great movie if you're looking to not take life too seriously for a couple of hours.
B00AJAFNIA|5.0|This is a fun game for all ages it is challenging but also very happy love the plot AMAZING game guys
B007OUFESC|2.0|i wanted to like the movie because of the stars (although more the guys than the girl). but found it slow, stilted and uninteresting. it's too bad...
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|The game is great. It's runs great and has made me jump several times. The game is for those who like they pc slender or the movie The Blair Witch Project. Hope others enjoy.
B006YXTRHY|2.0|disclaimer: I usually always like the books better than the movies. however, i have never liked a movie series based on the based on novels this little. starting from the the first twilight movie, i was disappointed. and each new movie in the series has not helped. now i'm watching just to be able to have my own opinion (rather than base it on hearsay), rather than for any enjoyment.
B009YU62H2|5.0|King Animal, I have to admit at first, was something I truly never saw coming, nor believed in once I found out about it. Being a long time Soundgarden fan I knew the music would be good, but I had my doubts about whether or not Chris Cornell could still pull this kind of stuff off after Audioslave's lackluster Revelations, and his last two solo albums of which completely and equally seemed to lack substance (save maybe a handful of tracks between the three of them). I told myself though, I would pick it up. I would check it out and give it a fair chance. And in the end, I'm glad that I did. The only two problems I have with the CD, at all, are that \\"Halfway There\\" feels more like a Chris Cornell solo track than anything Soundgarden would legibly come up with (and it shows in one of the video promos for the album with Kim Thayil and Ben Shepard, who themselves seem to kinda distance themselves from it), and the same exact thing with \\"Rowing.\\" Except, in the case of the latter, it feels like Beck with special guests Soundgarden. That doesn't make it a bad track, per se, but it just doesn't feel like a natural progression for the band. Barring these two tracks, however, this is probably the best overall record to come out of the last 10 years, and without doubt THE best of the 2010's so far. You're crazy as hell if you don't get this. Especially if you're a fan of Superunknown or Down On The Upside.
B00400NHRO|3.0|Bought this because the book has a \\"reputation\\" as a classic among many MDs, and I finally decided to see what it's all about.<br /><br />Parts of the book are interesting and informative (and funny, unless you're one of the types of patients so often referred-to as a GOMER or some other acronym), but overall the writing is rather amateurish. (Med students today have trouble writing lucid sentences or paragraphs, let alone an entire book, so the writing in House of God doesn't surprise me, given when in the author's early career it was penned).<br /><br />Although much of the book flows with a good story sequence, it ends with what I can best describe as a thud. A quick lead-up to the author deciding to become a psychiatrist, and with the rationale/explanation that apparently psychiatry is the only way really to help people. (That the author wound up becoming a shrink didn't surprise me at all, by the way.)<br /><br />Yes, all kinds of crap, inhumanities, and general nonsense get heaped on patients by physicians, but if you needed to read this book to learn that then you're out of touch with the real world as it was when the book was written (if not for centuries before), and they're applicable now.
B000E6UK5K|5.0|Wonderful album, David Gilmore and his band at their best. Heard it on the Albert Hall concert originally. Enjoy! Enjoy!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Love to play this game on my Kindle Fire when I am bored! The only downside is the volume control not being in game
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Great acting, deep characters, excellent cinematography...story line based on truisms...see how early 20th century Brits who were wealthy and in power lived.........
0395389496|5.0|The kids loved the movie and this book goes great with it.  Awesome pictures to go along with this fun story
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Highly recommend it to anyone who loves Temple Run and Subway Surfer! This is a must have app! They have really out done themselves on this one!!!
B000SEGUDE|5.0|Definitely a book that you have to pay attention to.  You get thrown in feet first, and it's a great ride trying to make the connections.  I read this in order to better understand the movie, and I'm now crossing my fingers that the movie will do this book justice.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Not really much to it but I find myself going back to it whenever I pick up my kindle. Strange really but fun to play.
B00A6VAW9W|5.0|Every now and then something special comes along.  When I first heard Blue Sky Riders I immediately became hooked on their intricate harmonies.  They write their own songs and each one is amazing in its own unique way. \\"Finally Home\\" is a complete collection of great songs and it is impossible to pick just one favorite.  Don't miss the opportunity to see this band perform live - their chemistry is AMAZING!  They never disappoint - I saw them play their hearts out for a small crowd at a record store when they could have easily gone home after 3 songs - they played 11!!!
B00095NX9G|5.0|I am still a beginning TS bellydancer, & a beginning dancer in general.  I will be challenged for what feels like decades with this one DVD!<br /><br />I will write that I am glad I am not going totally solo-- I use this & other Tribal Style Bellydance DVD's to practice at home, but I do take classes with an actual (TOTALLY AWESOME!) person who corrects me & I try to defer to her (TOTALLY AWESOME!) style when stuff on the DVD is different to what I remember from class.
B00992CF6W|5.0|If you don't like this game you are an idiot. Idiots are not good for a long time to go to a cologne to go to.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Love i. Don't want it to finish. Excellent writer. Can't believe this is the end. I want another trilogy, please.
B004FRX0MY|2.0|When I listen for 4 or 5 minutes, MP3 locks up and then turns off my phone. How do I prevent this
B005USZML4|4.0|It is good. But the book before it was better. Even though it is a book for kids, adullts will enjoy it.
1609613937|1.0|I have first handed tried all types and ways of eating.<br />I have tried low carb and low fat. Low carb, with an emphasis on eliminating, grains, fructose and vegetable oils, is what works for me and other people i know, both in terms of fat loss and in terms of being and feeling healthy in every way.<br /><br />The positive reviews for this book and the helpful votes of this book to me seem very suspect.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Love it. Love it. Love it. Excellent writer. Did excellent research. Love the theme. I like the way it is narrated.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|More fun than I thought it would be. I really like this app and would recomend it to horse lovers.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Love Grisham. But this is not his best book. Still, it was interesting but slow.. The best part is the surprising end.
B00881VLCE|4.0|good app for puzzles.  Lots of variety. The only thing that would make it better is if you could change the background color.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Love it. Best book of the trilogy because of the action in it with the side stories about Leila and Jack Hyde.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I love this game. Some parts were challenging but that's what's I loved about it. I would recommend it to everyone.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|This has a great story plus the visuals are beautiful. The editing is perfect. But best of all is the acting - how could you possibly miss with Willis, Murray, McDormand, Swinton, Balaban - but I want to say extra praise for Norton, Schwartzman and the two kids Hedges and Hayward (not a firm). Actually everyone was great. And don't forget Keitel.
B007M45PMU|5.0|Fantastic album. Would recommend to anyone who loves their hit song &#34;ho hey&#34;. Great tracks, very chill music. Love it!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is awesome for many reasons but I don't like how u have to wait awhile to go to compitions.
B00AVTMB4I|4.0|Anytime you enjoy watching a movie and its not totally filled with violence yet an adequate amount of human drama, and it keeps you engaged and its good acting...Of course its for us old guys too in that the music is from the early 80's.
0307352153|3.0|As an introvert, I was eager to read Quiet:  The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking by Susan Cain.  In this book, the author condenses research findings, relates history, and introduces individuals to explain what makes people introverted and why society--especially in the United States--doesn't appreciate the quiet among us.<br /><br />I was most fascinated to read about America's transition from a Culture of Character to a Culture of Personality.  (This concept was not originated by this author, but it's the first time I've read it.)  Up to about 1900, the ideal person was serious, disciplined, and honorable:  character traits that anyone could, with work, improve.  But with the rise of industry and the shift of population into cities over the next decades, we transitioned into a Culture of Personality.  What became valued were personality descriptors like magnetic, attractive, and forceful.  These not only define extroverts, but are traits that we are born with--or not.<br /><br />Quiet turned out to be not what I expected.  The research, though it won't help introverts cope in a culture that does not value them, was very interesting.  The book does contain some helps for introverts, but that's maybe one-third of the book.  Whether you'll like it depends on what you're looking for.<br /><br />I should note that Quiet is written for the secular market.  It contains a few mild expletives and quite a few references to evolution.  One of the notes at the end of the book is negative about the men who were prominent in the First and Second Great Awakenings and today's megachurch pastors.<br /><br />Disclosure:  I received a copy of this book, at no cost to me, for review purposes.  All opinions in this review are my own.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|Was very fun and entertaining especially to be free. Only bad part was it seems short. It ended too fast for me.
B00AECDDYY|5.0|A simple yet mentally engaging and seriously fun game! I'd love to see more content released -- 3 stages aren't quite enough.
B005LAII3U|4.0|The plot was basically the same but the location is totally different from the original &#34;Total Recall&#34;. But I like it this better than the first one.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this app is great i recommend using the seed zombie<br />I also love this game but it has some few bugs<br />My world turned survival into creative<br />i had lost about 100hours of playing<br />BUT THE APP IS STILL GREAT<br />please fix bugs and it would be almost perfect<br />Also please try to add minecraft for the ps vita
B005LAIISU|5.0|My kids loved it. Never get tired of watching the squirrel's misfortunes. I remember Coyote's similar unfortunate events. I'm sure they are going to make more sequel. Hope it will be good.
B00APUYN0I|4.0|I really like this movie, and I am far from musically inclined. However, I always like the acapella style and understand what life is like in a music group (my wife is a music teacher). Assuming you have nothing to do with this type of activity or have no interest in it, I would probably give the movie a 2 or 3 star rating because it does tend to be formulaic. There aren't really any surprises or major twists, but the acting is good and I really like the character interaction. It was a lot of fun and had great musical numbers that anyone in the the right generation will understand (plus enough throwbacks to get everyone else).
B005LAII80|3.0|I think the first one was a good plot. The new movie is like a copycat of the movie &#34;The Raid&#34; [Indonesian film]. One setting [building] and too much to cover for just 2 Judges to fight the bad guys. I applaud for the props though.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is a amazing game with the same qualities from the one on the computer and XBOX but cheaper it has all the same qualities the same weapons marlterials and animals plus this game you don't even have to worry about if you rembered to turn off the game system
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is a awesome game! The new turns and gameplay is epic. This game is a total use of storage and time.
B004LROUW2|1.0|This book is a big, or rather overlong, disappointment. In the end, after almost a thousand repetitive pages, it was just a trite, uninspired love story with some goofy stuff, that maybe someone's five-year-old daughter thought up, thrown in. Being the sort of person who hopes for the best and finishes what he starts in the way of movies , music and books, I finished the thing, but I'm sorry I did, because it just got worse and worse, as characters completely changed their behaviors to suit the inane, coincidence filled story, finally finishing with a heart warming hand holding scene on a child's slide in a public park, again possibly written or inspired by a five-year-old. Holding hands and looking at the moon. How corny can you get? Seems like the author just phoned it in, but while on the phone he just kept talking and talking and talking. By the way, may I ask, in all sincerity, if other readers found the excessive use of italics and bold font as irritating as I did? To what purpose does the author use my eyes thus? I have read Haruki Murakami works in the past and bought this book on the strength of them. My mistake.<br />Do yourself a favor, read some Yasunari Kawabata instead.
B009HNDTPO|4.0|This episode was not as suspenseful as most but hit high on the creepy meter. Now I hate marionettes as much as clowns

B00AAX68HG|4.0|Not as addicting as some and the first page of levels seems too easy. I guess i will see if it gets more challenging from there!<br />*edit: Okay may be slightly more addictive now that I have played it a while. I am going through an getting 3 stars on every sub-level. Some of them do make you think a little to get all three. If you get all three stars, on all sub-levels it opens a new sub-level in each \\"story\\" that actually makes you work for it.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|this game is pretty fun.  I thought it might be kind of stupid but it is actually really fun and a little addictive
1609611543|5.0|Great book, very informative! So happy I bought/read this! Makes so much sense! Wish there was more literature on this topic! I have lost weight and my belly is for sure going down, and my joints feel better too. I highly recommend this book.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|I have been a big fan of Tom Clancy, even reading the more recent books written by others. I have always considered those that he writes himself to be much better, with more intricate background and plot structures. He also includes elements in his books that are &#34;politically not allowed,&#34; and I think that this appeals to many of us who are tired of &#34;doing the right thing.&#34; This book is again good, but I don't believe he is currently achieving the quality that was present in his earlier works. The plots seem more predictable, and there is even a triteness developing in some of the characters. I was actually glad when I reached the last page, something that I did not experience in his first books. Nevertheless, it was a good read.
0345275055|5.0|This book had some of the most beautiful language I have ever had the pleasure to read. Take some time in your life, stop all the noise, and read something simple and beautiful...
B0076DCT2G|5.0|This is another in DeMille's great series involving John Corey. It is the characterization of Corey that makes these books so enjoyable, especially the witty and funny way in which DeMille depicts Corey's ever-present attitude. The reader is also placed directly in Yemen, feeling the tensions, intrigue,and severity of that environment. Corey does many things that we might like to do as readers, and he gets by with them. We can thus delve into this book and live vicariously.
B004DM0UII|1.0|Why does it require so much access to everything . The only thing this app should do is stream. Streaming music should not require so much access
B008X9Z37A|3.0|This case is on the flimsy side and offers minimal protection from falls. Made of a cheapo plastic material, there is nothing outstanding about this case which isn't particularly well padded. The anchors which are intended to keep my Kindle in place don't do much in that respect. The Kindle slips around and is not secure. There is no closure on this case which leaves it prone to flopping open. This is not good if you want to prevent scratching.<br />I'd advise passing on this case. It is not worth the money.
B002361MLA|5.0|The thoughts presented in this book are some of the most important truths that everyone needs to know.  It strips away the mystery surrounding time and eternity, telling it like it really is.  Read it at your peril for your thoughts will never be the same afterwards.

B006M7JCC2|5.0|This was the best description of a Near Death Experience I've come across.  How the author described it makes perfect sense and goes a long way towards explaining the mystery of death and what comes after.  This is a book everyone should read.
B0097PW7H8|4.0|Like the interface but which it was easier to use. Not sure what is doing. Looking for a app to help battery charge faster.
075669812X|5.0|it has the characters which my grandson loves.  And the heavy duty color pages, describing each character of the Ninjago is great.  Very nice purchase
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I really enjoyed reading Safe Haven.  I love it.  It made me think about how some  people are treated in their relationships with others.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I love the trilogy and the first book is my favorite. The whole book keeps me wanting more and more!
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|great movie..one of the best movies ive seen in a long time.i give it five stars as a top choice
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I appericated the writters prespective, well written and a great story of how difficult being an adolesent can be. Great read for an older teenager like 16 and up. and even for a parents I think it would be great for both the parent and teen read it together and talk about the differences.
1451695195|5.0|Just about everyone should read this book.  Eben is not a crackpot - he is a long time respected Harvard medical school practicing neurosurgeon.  What he tells us is true.  There may be a question for some if it actually happened but no doubt this memory is in his sub-concious.  Confirms what many of us suspect and denies what some do not want to believe exists.  Closest thing to some actual evidence we have on this subject.
B00A0SKFLG|3.0|The special effects are very good, the plot is ok but starts very slow, yawn yawn, but the acting is far from an oscar. HAd I known how bad I would never have watched it
1573301183|5.0|This is a must have for any Alice in Chains fan.  Their incredible talent is showcased in this performance, even in Layne Staley's final days as the front man.  It's plain to see the toll that Layne's addiction is taking on him physically; he looks like a shell of his former self.  It can be hard and depressing to watch, knowing that this beautiful, kind and talented man eventually shut everyone out of his life and lost his battle with drugs. Even though he looked to be in bad shape at this point, he still delivered an amazingly beautiful and haunting performance that will stick with you long after you've watched it.<br /><br />Seeing the band interact with each other in such an intimate, calm setting really tugs at the heart stings.  If you watch closely, you can see how Jerry is watching over Layne, encouraging him to try again when he makes a mistake in the verse during \\"Sludge Factory\\".  The band stops and Layne looks over to Jerry, as if he's looking for guidance.  Jerry calmly tells him that it's okay, try one more time.<br /><br />In the beginning of Angry Chair, Jerry is intensely watching Layne almost anticipating a mistake but Layne performs beautifully.<br /><br />My favorite moment is during the stunning, tear-jerking performance of \\"Down in a Hole\\" when Layne first sings the part, \\"but my wings have been so denied.\\"  In the background, you can see Jerry wink and give the biggest smile when Layne absolutely nails his part here.<br /><br />Alice in Chains is one of the best bands, not only out of the Seattle \\"grunge\\" era, but anywhere, anytime.  Layne's voice was so unique, so beautiful, and he sang from the depths of his heart and it really shows.  Jerry is a brilliant song writer, guitarist and vocalist.  No one can match the beauty of their vocal harmonies together.  Sean Kinney and Mike Inez also deliver stellar performances, as well as the guest guitarist.  Sean Kinney's percussion work on \\"No Excuses\\" is breathtaking.  I also love when Mike busts out Metallica's \\"Enter Sandman\\" between songs.<br /><br />It is sad to watch this and see what a huge loss it was when Layne died.  Not only did we lose an amazing musician, but a kind, smart and funny man as well.  I hope that he has now finally found the peace in death that he could not find in life.  It's easy to focus on his tragic death but I try to remind myself to be thankful for the short time Layne was alive and created this beautiful music for us to enjoy.  Sometimes when I'm feeling down I put their music on and hearing Layne sing with so much pain and emotion, I know I'm not alone.<br /><br />I'm happy that Jerry has continued to write and perform music when he could have easily just given up and disappeared.  He's still doing what he loves and touching people with his music.  I think Layne would have wanted that.<br /><br />RIP - Layne Staley

B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is fun and is a great way to pass time! I love horses so this game is great for me!
B007KZY1YY|5.0|Kept me on the edge constantly. I couldn't put my kindle down. E.L James, I love your writing I do hope she continues to write the story
B003UBTX7C|5.0|I was thrilled to see the camel club characters back!  Great page turner again by d. Baldacchi.  You won't be disappointed.....
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Try and imagine a really excellant drama with zombies! It's so well written and beautifully acted you really feel a emotional tie to the characters. Surprises around every corner, this show has you hanging off the edge of your seat!
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I wasn't sure about reading this series until I saw the show on tv and then I knew I HAD to read the books. Very good story! Now to start book two.
0425252868|5.0|I, like so many others here, loved this book.  It IS great.  It IS riveting.  But I would like to add some reasons that are special to me.<br /><br />(a)  The description of living in the Sahara desert.  The hot days and cold nights.  Watching out for poisonous snakes and deadly black desert scorpions.  And the German pilots looking up into that beautiful Sahara night sky from inside their \\"graves\\" (i.e. foxholes sized for cots).  I worked for a short time in the Sahara 29 years ago and felt like I was back there as I read this part.<br /><br />(b)  The American pilot, who as a prisoner in Buchenwald, called over a German Luftwaffe officer and told him in perfect German what was really going on in that camp.  My dad, although the second generation of his family born in the USA (1919), learned English as his second language.  Like so many others born into German communities in central Texas, German was his first language.  And, like so many other Americans of German descent, Daddy fought for this country - in his case, as a young Navy Seabee on Guadalcanal.<br /><br />(3)  The fact that the NAZI leadership was just about as incompetent as they were evil.  Could this have been the hand of God?  A good friend of mine, in his 80's now, who flew P-51's on bomber support missions, certainly thinks so.  He still just shakes his head and gets very quiet when he recounts the mis-use of the ME-262, among so many other NAZI blunders.  I loaned him my copy of this book when I finished it.  He will enjoy it but he will find no surprises.  It reads so very much like Bob has described to us over the years.....
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I have been looking for a game like this for a long time. I would definantly regimens this app to horse lover's like mwa ;*)
B0063GORYU|4.0|When playing this version I find that when I make a move it does not always go to the obvious play which causes me to have to force it to move to the correct one.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The book was fantastic I could not put it down I really think it's great and that anyone could read It and enjoy every exciting word of it
B005OCFHHK|5.0|I was so happy when I saw this on sale on Amazon!! I bought it as a Christmas gift for my wife and we ended up watching it over her Christmas break. It's nice to have all of the movies in one set now instead of all different cases. Great set to keep!!!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|The game is addicting.  Great game for kids.  My daughter does not want to put it down.  I wish it was a little bit easier to increase your energy.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|A good read but I kind of got lost or bored in the lawyer talk sometimes. Very twisty plot that kept up the suspense.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Couldn't put it down. Little far fetched but it's fiction, what do you expect. I would suggest  it to a friend.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It is ALOT like temple run brave. It has great graphics and it takes awhile to get used to just like the original. It's a great game! Awesome action and crazy stunts make it more intense in this sequel to the top rated game in the market place. It is highly addicting
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I play a lot of these games and I enjoyed this one. It flows nicely and the puzzles are enough to make you think- but not get frustrated.
B00AB0AR2U|4.0|Though not as off the chain as the first through third installments, it kept our interest. Would watch again more than likely
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I can't believe this series is over! Books were all fantastic! Extremely hard to put down! Guess I will have to wait for the movies, hope they stay true.
B009329ZF2|5.0|Really enjoyed this flick.  Rihanna was better than I expected in her first acting role in a major movie. Lot of action.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This isn't as bad as I thought it might have been. I love it! Recommend to anyone who likes or loves horses .. I should know since I'm 16 going on 17 playing this game :D
B002VWNICW|5.0|I had it in DVD.  I was hoping blu-ray would make me fall in love with Darcy more.  LOL!  I just wanted the best quality view for a really great movie. I love the casting.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The hunger games has been one of my favorite books and movies in a while. I love the way the author captures every detail, She makes it seem like your right their fighting to the death with Katniss, Peeta, and all the other tributes. She's an  amazing writer and I encourage you all to read this amazing trilogy by Mrs/ Ms. Collins :)
B008U7ZPHS|5.0|I have read all the other book and this book does not disappoint. It has a great storyline and It will leave you cozy in your couch for days. All I can say is, its a great read!
B001W63DX2|5.0|Having been able to see maiden for the first time in this tour I gotta say that I was given more than what I originally expected. Set list is great, performances are flawless and the vibe is simply unique and breathtaking.<br /><br />This show, plus the documentary is a must have for Maiden and heavy metal fans.
B00AFWEPVI|4.0|I got this app after the highly unprofessional and unfinished app called HD Camcorder decided to glitch out on me. The other app caused a problem, however, that followed to this app as well. Whilst adjusting the video quality on the other app, it caused a glitch which was forewarned in the apps description in which the video function becomes unusable. However, this impairment followed to this app as well. The problem lies within the operating system, not the app. If your camera/video function is freezing with a window that pops up saying, &quot;Camera has stopped&quot;, your solution is this&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br />1) Go to your clock drag down menu and click &quot;more&quot;<br />2)Click applications then installed applications and then scroll down to the camera app of your purchase and click.<br />3)Now, click force stop and then click clear data. After that, shut down and restart your Kindle.<br />4)This should fix the problem. If not, then you must take a more drastic step.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br /><br />--You will have to restore your Kindle to factory defaults. This will remove all apps, saved data, etc. However, you will have no trouble getting your apps back due to them being on your Amazon account.<br /><br />Step 1) Drag down menu, them click more.<br />Step 2) Click device then scroll down to restore to factory defaults and click.<br /><br />This will completely reset your Kindle. You will have to re-register your Kindle to your account and re-register your Facebook and other things and then re-download your apps which you WILL NOT HAVE TO PAY FOR AGAIN. This should be the end all be all of fixes, being that it is your only other solution. However, if for some unfathomable reason this hasn't fixed the problem, chances are you have a virus or software issue. Then you will need to follow up with Amazon Customer service and support.<br /><br />Now that this app has had updates and fixes, there should be no problems unless you have downloaded another app that has tinkered with the settings within the device itself. Have fun!t has tinkered with the settings within the device itself. Have fun!
B001DMJ9R4|5.0|This concert is so nice and powerful that I have seen it many times, they play most of their hits up to the avenged seven fold album.  The band walks off stage and you get a feeling of wanting more, but in a good way, because it is such a nice concert. Highly recommended for those who think A7X is emo band.... His shows why not!
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|This processor is the best in the market right now. i7 is just overkill.<br /><br />Overclocked to 4ghz and still stays at 40-50C in gaming.
B00APUYN0I|5.0|Love this movie  great entertainment ..Enjoyed every minute of this movie ...Funny ,Great singing, I  will be buying the Blueray ...  I esp Love watching it on my Kindle HD
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this app is very awesome it works fine on my kindle fire no complain its freezes sometimes tho need an upgrade.....love this app
B00A8SPNYW|5.0|From Cheese was for my grandson. He enjoys it. He got a Kindle Fire for Christmas, which he loves. Excellent investment.
B004UJTG6Q|3.0|The book was interesting but next time make the next page other percent,pretty please?<br />Over everything I said before I liked the Book alot
3836501910|4.0|IT'S WHAT YOU EXPECT FROM THE EARLY RICHARDSON. TONS OF NUDITY, SURPRISING SHOTS OF PENIS' AND VAGINAS, COW UTTERS, A WOMAN WHO LAYS GOLDEN EGGS, CLASSIC KATE MOSS PHOTOGRAPHY AND FEATURES A STRING OF PORN STARS, CELEBRITIES, MODELS AND BATMAN. A SEQUENCE OF IMPROMPTU SHOOTS, UNPLANNED PARTIES AND A RADICAL POINT OF VIEW FROM THE GENIUS MIND OF TERRY. NOT RECOMMENDED FOR THE MODEST.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|By far one of the best books I have ever read. I don't think anyone can not like this book, it's just not possible. It'll have you crying, laughing, and it really does open your eyes to everything we take for granted. Read this book and you won't forget it.
1439163154|3.0|HARD A HARD TIME SHIFTING FROM CHARACTERS... ONE CHAPTER IS FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF A HIGH SCHOOL GIRL WHO DATES A TEACHER, ANOTHER POINT OF VIEW IS FROM A HIGH SCHOOL STONER IN SEARCH OF A GUN... ADDITIONAL PERSPECTIVES FROM A CHILD WHO TRAVELS TO YOSEMITE WITH HIS FATHER AND BROTHER... IT'S RANDOM AND VULGAR. AN EASY READ BUT A HARD PLOT(?) TO FOLLOW. IT'S LIKE A MEMORY SEQUENCE OF ADOLESCENCE AND CONFESSIONS.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Cool and entertaining game. A good way to pass the time. The graphics are great and there's a lot of different things to do. Overall a great app a d I highly recommend it to anyone  who like horses or animals in general
B008CP6RWU|5.0|I was very excited, but at the same time scared to play this game.  The reviews are so incredibly high, I didn't see how it was possible it would live up to my extremely elevated expectations.  I'm speaking specifically to \\"Journey\\" as I have not played the other games enough to comment.  I made sure to block 2 hours of my time so I could play all the way through.  I must say that I loved it.  \\"Journey\\" alone is worth 5 stars.<br /><br />I won't give any spoilers, but my only \\"negative\\" comment is that the beginning of the game is slow.  I understand this is done on purpose and allows the user to learn the controls and get a feel for the game.  Those with little patience may need to practice some restraint in the beginning, but it definitely pays off to stick with it.<br /><br />I generally like action and RPG type games.  This was a wonderful change of pace.  There is a little strategy to the game, but you can really play however you like.  Cruise through as fast as you can, take your time and enjoy the scenery, or even help out your companions along the way.  Whatever your preference, this game can tailor to your style of play.<br /><br />One quick note.  If you particularly enjoy playing with a certain companion, be sure to finish the level at the same time.  That will allow you to travel to the next level together.  If you do not finish at the same time, you will be paired up with a new companion at the next level.<br /><br />Extremely enjoyable.  Replayable.  Fantastic.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Love this amazing game! Better than the best game alive with good challenging puzzles this game will make you smarter while playing fun games.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|You'll love this game! Fast paced and definately addicting! Be prepared for your heart to be racing! and you'll be hitting RUN AGAIN time and time again!
B0091REZMW|4.0|If you are looking for a hidden object game you will enjoy this one. Although entertaining it seems no different than any other eye spy game I have played.
034580404X|1.0|i never review items, but on this occasion, it was necessary:<br />if i could only turn back time... because this was a waste of it.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|Quirky story with painting quality photography.  Simple, touching story . It's no wonder famous stars like working on his films.
B004GTLFNW|5.0|Price of the book and the android app and I'm on the road to better health with little cash out lay. I like the author's philosophy that you don't need a gym nor expensive equipment to exercise. I might be biased by his military background being an old, but out of shape, former Marine. I think everyone that really wants to improve their body for whatever reason can benefit from his book. The app isn't really necessary, but for $1.99 its a really nice adjunct. I believe there is a iPhone app too. Book describes like 125 bodyweight exercises and different variations of each to make them easier or harder depending on your current condition. Good basic info on nutrition and more. I'm on week three of his basic 10 week course following the app and I am already seeing usable results. I know that if I do my honest best, even if it isn't anywhere near pro level, at the end of 10 weeks I'll be in much better shape than when I started. I think the book is necessary to go along with the app so you know why you are doing what you are doing. Recommended.
B00AE2LJVS|1.0|We like Shia LaBoeuf, but every scene was mega violence with little in between.  Not much of a story.  We didn't finish it.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|Insightful. Told from the patient's perspective. A clear sighted view of a families' struggle to deal with Alzheimer's disease.  An important read
B009CCBCU4|4.0|Good writing, interesting plot. Good background on historical meso-america. Easy reading. I was engrossed with the description of life of the natives of pre-Colunbian Mexico.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|get this app so much better than the first temple run  my 10 year old daughter loves it its all she plays
B00AMBK0X4|2.0|I considered many ways to describe this film, but most people have already covered it. So, I'll reduce my review to a single word: tedious.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Really helps with super challenging math while preparing for ISAT (the state test). I would get horrible grades without it on my kindle fire
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I had heard the Walking Dead series was good but never caught it on TV.  It had a lot better story line than I expected - my wife even is hooked on it - and she doesn't like zombie movies.  It is nice to not have to watch all the commercials!  Highly recommend this series!
B006LSZECO|3.0|Like other readers I raved to friends about how great this book was. Twists and turns everywhere. You love a character then you hate them. The ending totally ruined it for me because it just stopped-maybe there will be a sequel. I would have given this book 5 stars until the end. I am anxious read another Flynn novel though because I did like her writing. Read it but be prepared for an ending you may not like-it just stopped.
B006FO3ERQ|4.0|Ford cites Thomas Hardy late in this novel and I think his philosophy of man's helplessness is very Hardy-like. A terrific tale.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This was an extremely well written book.  I laughed, cried, everything.  This invaded my dreams (not in a good way since I have kids myself) but it was still a very good book.  It's such a senstive topic but it was very good.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Good game, fun to play. If you own horses, you do this stuff for real. Maybe not so much fun.  Still it's a fun app. The first of your own horses is the one you remember the most.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|My husband has the otterbox defender for his iphone but I decided to try the LifeProof.  I love it!  It is more compact than the otterbox and protects everypiece of the phone.  I read all reviews before I purchased and some people had said that it was harder to hear with this case.  I didn't find this to be the case.  The screen protector is even better on this too.  My husband is going to switch to the lifeproof also (just in a different color of course)!
B00062PN6I|4.0|For $15, these are a pretty good value. These do NOT sound like my good pair of wireless headphones at home, but I use these at work for a few minutes a day... And they get the job done. They are a little more heavy duty than a flimsy set of headphones that I was using before... The sound isn't all that great, but if you just need a cheap pair of headphones for normal everyday use these work... Also, the cord is sort of short.... Works well for me because I use these at a desk, but something to consider....
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I love this app for up to date weather information.  It will let you know severe weather and up to a 10 day forecast.
B003EI2EH2|5.0|You are so intrigued by the experiments and his sense of humor that you forget you are learning. I like the fact that he broke it down so that you can go straight to the stuff that interests you, and then go back to the other stuff when you have time.
0525478817|5.0|Bought for my daughter for xmas.  She loved this book.  She's in high school so it's more for that age group.
B004XZR63M|5.0|Very inspirational! I have read books on how to make your body stronger. I have read books about how to make my mind stronger and be more successful. This book is like a workout manual for your bank account.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I get so many ideas from pinterest.  I'm on it almost everyday seeing new recipes, crafts, etc.  I am completely addicted.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Just amazing to hear what our brave men and women go through day to day. I wasn't expecting to laugh at this book and it actually made me laugh out loud! All I can say is thank you Mr. Kyle for your service and for the great stories.
B008JGSM6G|2.0|I actually downloaded this for my kids to play and I have played it once or twice.  okay if you need to pass a few minutes but gets boring pretty fast.
B00A9X9ORI|1.0|This was a terrible movie, wasted 90 minutes of my life!! Don't waste your money, acting and plot were subprime.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love this app...play it everyday!!!  Simple and FREE...wish it did't have the ads but that goes with FREE, I guess!
B003MC5N28|4.0|I say it was a very good book and you should read it. I recommend to read the rest as well, but they won't make sense unless you read this one 1st
B005CRQ2IU|5.0|A great read for anyone looking for a quality graphic novel. I recommend it for 17-25 year old because of the subject matter.
B00973DDN2|5.0|These guys just haven't made a bad album yet.  If you are a fan or no, this will knock your socks off
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|Not as good as the second, but a great film nonetheless. The ending will satisfy for those looking for a happy epilogue while still being plausible.
B000F8O2PG|5.0|i love this show. all of the episodes. want to get the rest of the seasons. but its a start.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is good but I would make the gems more common<br /> In the fameI would also make the cave earlier
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|Turn after turn this book kept me interested. You would never expect half the things that happen! Wish there were more to read.
B0014DW3OS|5.0|One of the rare situations where the 2 roles in 2 different movies are different, but theatrically have the same effect. Denzel and Russell could switch places in the different movies and still both movies would fair as well theatrically; those characters are that similar in application and practice. Training Day is better throughout, but Dark Blue has a better ending.<br /><br />Denzel starts the movie out by trying to convince Hoyt through intimidation(makes him look like a sissy when he either reluctantly or does not conform to the smaller tactics of dirtiness and control). At the same time, Denzel has a plan that he has working to ensure the success of his schemes and agenda. Denzel is the perfect puppetmaster, if you will bend--even unbeknownst to you--then he'll get you. If you compared Denzel to Van Meter, there's no comparison--as Denzel is  far more subtle; uses widely varying psychological methods to coerce one's emotions or what the person will logically  accept/tolerate; and, therefore,could affect many more people(Van Meter only demands, uses associations, and uses tactics like you owe me or this is the last time). Case in point, Denzel has 3 or 4 known killers who are cops that he's coerced into infamy. The thing is that Hoyt(Hawke) resists the programming or there wouldn't be a movie. Although some of this programming causes Hoyt to do things that he wouldn't otherwise do, it does not have the desired effect: it does not change him. Hoyt--for the most part--knows who he is and is comfortable with that. Denzel--when manipulating people--uses subtlety; he goes down a similar road with situations. When he finds out that Hoyt will not be programmed into murder, he subtly--through his Hispanic gang banger connections--seeks to put his lights out. Hoyt's only saved when(bc he saved the lead gangster 's cousin from being raped by crackheads)the lead gangster lets him go. A battle ensues between Hoyt and Denzel, but the battle does not end the movie and I will not give it away. Favorite Segment of the Movie: [In anger, Denzel says when confronted by a community that attempts to help Hoyt remove tyrant Denzel] \\"King Kong ain't got ..it on me! I work here; y'all just live here.\\" The Original Dark Blue--Russell probably got ideas and pointers from Denzel. PG compared to Dark Blue and yet loses no value. 5 Stars out of 5.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I thought this book was excellent, was I retesting and different! I enjoyed it thoroughly up through its harrowing end! You gotta love Sky and Holder.. There's something to be said for that intense new young love that the author captures vividly! I thought Sky was like able and relatable!! I recommend this book for anyone who wants a different story to enjoy!!
B000IMKDPC|5.0|DC must have a child consultant on their movies, bc all of them are bad. Marvel--on the other hand--has plenty of good ones! The XMEN Movie Series, the Spiderman Movie Series, the Blade Series, Fantastic 4, Hulk, etc. They've had some duds, too(Iron Man, Fantastic 4 II, Elektra, Blade Trinity, the 2nd Hulk movie, Daredevil, etc.), but that total comes to 10 to 0 against DC(if you count movies with lasting impact). Might I add, that's also in a shorter frame of time.    X-MEN movies point indirectly to the Civil Rights Struggle or Battle For Equality/Freedom To Thrive. Sub mutants in for minorities/undesirables and humans in for RACIST whites/intolerant people and X-MEN comes into clearer focus. This movie features leader and professor Xavier(extraordinary, unbelievable mental control-- enhanced even more by Cerebro: a device that gives Xavier scanning, pinpointing, and other special extras) who runs his school for mutants(usually powerful) which doubles as a defense agency. The hands-on agency particularly deals with mutant vs. human rights/affairs--with no quarter given to either side. Xavier's mutants important to this movie are Cyclops (field leader and has a powerful optic blast), Jean Grey(Cyclops' wife and controls objects with her mind plus is slightly psychic), Storm(the power of the weather--any of them), Wolverine(unbreakably metallic claws; unbreakably metallic skeleton; heightened senses despite being a heavy smoker; and almost instantaneous healing ability from almost any illness or injury), Iceman(generates ice), and Rogue(can absorb another's life force: partly or completely & their feelings/memories/abilities for a relatively short time; when doing so, she weakens the victim and can kill, if prolonged). Iceman and Rogue are teenagers and numbered as apart of the children: not allowed to fight at this point. They try to use peace to solve their problems, but, in situations where this is not possible or their special abilities give them an added boost,they will use their abilities. His team of mutants also have access to a state of the art jet. Enter their problem in this movie: Magneto(decades ago, he and Xavier were tight friends working for Xavier's transcendent goal until Magneto's--prior to officially becoming Magneto--family gets killed by humans) now regards Xavier as a civil acquaintance and will attack anything or anyone who interferes with his mission: mutant superiority to humans. Helping him are likeminded mutants: Mystique(shifts into the form of other people), Toad(super long tongue and frog like abilities), and Sabretooth(stronger than Wolverine and has his healing ability without the metallic claws). Magneto plans on turning all humans into mutants and this involves the death of Rogue and all the death of the humans to which this machine's energy is applied. The old friends' missions always clash and, many times, battles break out. Magneto and Xavier clash in a dramatic scene from a comic scene standpoint. Storm clashes with Sabertooth and Toad(both relatively short, but dramatic battles). Wolverine clashes with Mystique and Sabertooth(pretty good battles). Magneto is a magnetic giant; while, Wolverine has a metallic skeleton. Mystique and Toad are at least as agile as Spider-Man--no X-man is agile(all but Wolverine are static or stiff). Sabertooth is a good bit stronger than any X-man and he heals up like Wolverine, too. Magneto has a helmet that protects him from mental probing and can fly like Jean Grey or Storm, so that cancels out Xavier, Storm, or Jean Grey there. It's almost as if the X-men, though being power heavy, are handicapped against those enemies. This all comes to a head and a good comic book ending. The best of the series. 5 Stars out of 5.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|It was action packed and has  good flash back moments.  I would recommend this to any one that likes superhero type movies/shows.
B003O86FMW|5.0|It started out predictable and then...bam.....it really takes you on a ride! Well done Suzanne. Can't wait to read book 3.
B0085KGHOK|5.0|This is one of the best concerts I've seen on blu ray, slipknot is a great live and studio band ever but that'sy opinion so anyway anyone that's a slipknot fan this is a must have . This is a great show and not to mention this is shot before the death of Paul their bassist which was great to see him play for one last time . A must have!!!!
B008QTVNUI|5.0|The show is incredible! It has a lot of twists and turns that make you wonder what will happen next.
B003ODL004|5.0|I have some of Hans Zimmer's scores(Gladiator, Simpsons, Black Hawk Down)and these show what a versatile composer he is. And this ranks right up there with his best work. The movie and the music are indelibly intertwined. During the actions scenes, his music propels the action forward. And the end is captured with his haunting notes. When his career is viewed in totality , I think  he will rank as one of the all time greats. And this will be ranked among his best scores!
B008JGSM6G|1.0|Unfortunately I do not have an android and was not able to play the game and on top of that it was difficult to download.<br /><br />Not Impressed.
B005D0RDKW|5.0|A nice tribute to cleveland where rush got their start in the states. The two songs Caravan, Brought Up To Believe that would later bow on the Clockwork Angels album are signs of great things to come. Presto, for me is an overlooked gem that gets it's due here! But the real highlight is having all of Moving Pictures played live! A must for the real rush fan!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app..I an 12 years old and as soon as I get home I play this game before I don't homework
B009HELT3C|5.0|Amazing Movie! The Best Of The Trilogy! Finally Got To See Another Side Of Kay! You Will Not Be Disappointed!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I like this game because you get to work your skill it takes practice and focus you must watch every moment
B0041KKYGU|4.0|Funny movie, surprisingly so. I got this for under $3 between Thanksgiving and Christmas, when they have great deals on many products.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This is a good game. .It has me hooked and it's very good quality. It shows what its like to have a horse sort of and it has other things you can do as well.
0316010669|4.0|This was a supplemental book I needed for one of my college classes, so I wasn't expecting to enjoy it too much. However, it is a very interesting, enlightening read!
B0022CY8WK|5.0|SOUNDS AMAZING! AND SO EASY TO PUT INTO ANY OTHER DEVICE! WAY MORE CONVENIENT AND CHEAPER THAN ANY OTHER WAY :)
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game test your reflexes pretty well, you have to be dodging all those objects including the trains while the &#34;big guy&#34; and his dog chases you.  Its fun.
B009ZQC7MY|2.0|I have Hulu attached to my tv with a hdmi cord so I ordered the episode I missed in HD, but all I could get was SD quality.  Wasted a dollar, it seems.  It's been so long since I've seen anything in SD--we're so spoiled!
B00A8ZZ2Z0|5.0|This is a fantastic release from Helloween. i enjoyed this right from the very first listen and i was instantly hooked. i enjoyed this one even more than the previous 7 Sinners album, Mainly because this one has more melody to it harkening back to albums such as Master of the Rings, And Time of the Oath. Where as 7 Sinners was a full on metal assault record. This album is very consistant and the flow of this album is superb. There is enough charm and shivalry to this recording to satisfy not just power metal fans, But fans of any genre of music. Great riffs, Great melodies, Catchy choruses, And great hooks. This album has it all, And it's one of the best records the band has ever done. i strongly reccomend you going out and buying this release. i guarentee you will love it.
B008AK8FHM|1.0|This book was terribly disappointing.  I felt like it was written for Sunday School teachers, especially Baptist or Southern Baptist Sunday School teachers, to hand out to their students.<br /><br />I WANTED truly and so badly to believe some part - ANY part, but its just another re-hash of what everyone has learned about Heaven in church.  Tedious and boring; I've quit reading it several times, but determined to finish it, I finally did so.  I cannot recommend this book to anyone except very religious people.<br /><br />NDE are totally believable and during my career I've known several people who experienced them.  But no one used the word \\"God\\" - only family, friends, peace and love.
B0036EH40Q|5.0|It was Val Kilmers birthday last year and I remembered that I hadn't seen Tombstone in a long time and I could not find it anywhere for rent and it was difficult as well to find in the stores so I went on-line and Amazon had it, of course. Now I have the Blu-Ray in movie collection. Love it!
B000002AGN|5.0|Listening to Dave Brubeck is one of my favorite ways to spend a Friday evening (along with some good wine).  This is really a classic album from the guy who really revolutionized the rhythms of jazz.  Everyone should have a copy of this great album.
B00AYB1RGG|3.0|The special effects of the movie were pretty cool  - and I love Karl Urban - but honestly anyone could've been Dredd since they never did show him without the helmet.  Disappointed.
B0021L8V0M|5.0|The movie is fast paced, intriguing, and has lots of unexpected twists. No one could survive the injuries Salt would sustain but don't take the movie seriously and you will really enjoy the adventure. The Director's cut provides explanations for how or why things happen that the regular movie leaves you questioning.
B00AIA89HS|4.0|Hatebreed's 2013 album The Divinity Of Purpose is their sixth full-length studio album of original material. It follows up their 2009 Self Titled album which expanded the band's sound a little and it is the first Hatebreed album to come out after Jasta's self-titled 2011 solo album, which took the core Hatebreed sound and made it a lot more commercial and melodic sounding.<br /><br />The Divinity Of Purpose at first appearances seems like something of a reaction against both of those records. If you look at the beginning and end of the record it is arguably their fasted, heaviest and most direct album to date. There is a lot less deviation from the established Hatebreed sound, and songs are all pretty brief and straight-forward. There are still chanting backing vocals, crunchy guitars, grooves and breakdowns of course, it is a Hatebreed album after all, but the band seem to be in the mood for the fast, loud and angry side of music this time around. It wouldn't be unreasonable to say that they've taken more of a Slayer influence this time around.<br /><br />With that being said; the record isn't devoid of absolutely all variety whatsoever, and from about the halfway point the band start changing things up a little. `Dead Man Breathing' for example, sounds like something from their Self Titled album, and is one of the slowest moments here. The title-track is a little reminiscent of `I Will Be Heard' after a fashion and `Indivisible' has a punky feel to it.<br /><br />Highlights include `The Language' which has some fun lead guitar briefly, as well as the aforementioned `Indivisible' and the very catchy `Nothing Scars Me Anymore' which is sure to become a live favourite.<br /><br />The album was produced by Zeuss again, and as such sounds fantastic. If you are expecting something drastically, drastically different to what the band have released before you may be disappointed. Its more of the same, with even less surprises than usual and yet it's a damn good album. The band are still brilliant at what they do and just know how to make this style of music sound good. This is another set of songs in their trademark style, so its logically going to be a very good album. Even with that `know what to expect' idea that follows Hatebreed around, it has its own place in their catalogue thanks to its especially straight forward, hard-hitting nature and I recommend it if you like the band.band are still brilliant at what they do and just know how to make this style of music sound good.

B005CRQ4GU|4.0|I bought this book because I read all the other books it was good but I just wish it was longer because I read this really quick
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I live this game it is so fun my friend shows me this game and if I never found out about this game then I am just missing out on every thing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I love this game I hope you guys make a temple run 3 u really should<br />P
0345803485|5.0|Ok, so I just finished book one, and will definately purchase the next. Lets face it people, this book is pure beach read. Yes it is a bit repetitive, however how many ways can you explore BDSM. It is, simply what it is.<br /><br />And, if any of you were COMPLETELY HONEST with yourselves, you couldn't tell me there wasn't some twinge of,  Oh my,,, would I enjoy that.... What woman wouldn't want to let herself go, for just one day, with Christian Grey? It's Fantasy, it's sexy, It's for entertainment purposes only.<br /><br /> With that being said, I do have to warn you, your bedroom life may just get a little hotter!!<br />Read on, real housewives!!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I think you should improve your game, because of how long your run! Also you should improve your characters. By the way I love your game otherwise.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|it is good but I don't like how the monster thing chases you I was doing good and ham!!!it ate me like realley what does that
0765325950|5.0|I remember devouring each and every book in this series as it came out.  Despite trudging along sometimes, the end finally arrived and it was quite satisfying.  I'll echo what some of the other reviews say about it being a bit too much of a battle scene, but overall, very strong work and way better than I had expected, considering the enormity of the task of tying up the WoT....<br /><br />I would recommend this book in a heartbeat to anyone who is or has been a WoT fan.  That being said, the book drags and the pitched battle that takes up a lot of the story really could have concentrated more on individual battles/struggles, and some of the villains that had had such a large buildup were discarded quite quickly/easily.  But again, credit to Sanderson for tying things up, and he wrote a much better Mat this time around.
B00AXVIHBU|5.0|I fell in love with the series and was so disappointed to find that season three would cost me so much to watch... but then i found season three episodes for free at pbs.org
B006VA3ZEG|5.0|A very interesting viewpoint from the perspective of the dual class society that existed in England at the beginning of the 20 century.<br /><br />At first, I have to admit that being a man, I thought that Downton Abbey would be for women. Not so.<br /><br />I find it abhorrent to think that PBS would have the nerve to edit for American audiences. It would be like the English editing Roots or Dallas for play in England. Please do not do that anymore.
B00007KWHG|4.0|The products has come home on time and in excellent condition and plays excellent with crystal clarity. Valli is a great song artist.
B003O86FMW|3.0|Ugh assoc and the hobbits made a mistake of this article was written for your website and approximately the count
B008MEM24S|5.0|it is a fun game to past the time when you travel or when you are just sitting there. That is why I like this game so much.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book is awesome!  Characters were easy to fall in love with.  I have read all three of this author's books and this one is my favorite!!!!
B00AREIAI8|1.0|I would enjoy the game more if I could actually play the game... It will not load at all..... and it would be nice if it was was on facebook also.<br />Thank you
B004WGGQPQ|4.0|This is so great for kids!!  You can entertain them while still encouraging creativity... all on the go with no mess!  You can save their pictures and post them on FaceBook to share with family. It would be better if while in the paint portion it virtually mixed colors more like real paint (I have program like this on another computer).  Also there is a little glitch that when you try and &#34;share&#34; a picture from the drawing pad program, it tells you there are no apps to do this with.  but you be able to do it with any app like Face Book.  If you save creations to the gallery, then from face book you can upload pictures. That's why I gave it a 4.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|it is one of the best games I had ever played and it is as best as the first one
B0083EW97W|5.0|I have never been a huge John Mayer fan, but this CD is great.  I am so happy with this purchase.  I can listen to every song without feeling like I need to skip one.  That, to me, is a trademark of a great album.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|A really good read but I was hoping for more movement in the story and character experiences after waiting five years for this next chapter. I hear Martin plans on another 3-5 books in this series, I'll be near death at this rate. Don't read this until you finish the previous 4 books in the series, you'll be lost and never finish it. Drags along in places and I forced myself to finish it in hopes the next one will be better.
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|I watched American Idol last year because of this guy.  His album definitely did not disappoint.  I wish that he would tour with the Lumineers!
B004JN1D2I|5.0|A modern day Tolken. You won't finish this series in a hurry but you'll enjoy the shock of the events and characters. Nothing is sacred. About the time you really start likeling a character, he/she gets killed off. Keeps you on your toes and out of a rut. Set aside 4 months for this read.
B009VLX8FS|5.0|I wish Taylor wasn't so cheesy in her love life, but it sure does produce some great songs.  She is a guilty pleasure to listen to.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Now I want to read every one in the Jack Reacher series. The movie got my interest up and the first book grabbed me. I like Lee Child's style of writing and the steady flow towards the finish is refreshing. Not much fluff and useless page fillers. Good stuff.
B0000X61VE|5.0|I had this workout on VCR tape from the early 90's.  It is still one of the best workouts available.  The moves she uses are still some of the most recommended today to firm up and get some definition.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for a great workout.
B001NHNG64|5.0|Great story line, action and well written. The flow and suspense of this book is just right with just the right amount of plot twists and unexpected discoveries. I love the way Lee Child weaves researched information into the story.
B007IK44CK|1.0|I saw this in the theater and my buddy and I agreed that it was formulaic and frankly disappointing. I enjoyed the first MI, don't remember the second, and strongly recommend against this tired third sequel.
B007BFSYMS|4.0|Works well. I enjoy a lot of the available sounds but I really wish there were a way to combine some of them. (If there is, I've not found it yet.)
B000FC0OOU|1.0|the book is censored ! not original text , should be removed, and replaced with the un-edited original version. why are altered books being sold ?
B002VPE1WK|5.0|When you have invested greatly in a product you have to protect that investment people work 2 hard for the money they have to give it away, i tested this bag and it works greatly, looks great as well, had to order a second one thanks to amazon .
B003N5VOUO|5.0|I love this bollywood movie. Excellent realistic story. It's basic message is the ill treatment and prejudiced attitude as aftermath of the 9-11 attack. It is focused though on the life of a single autistic man. Very funny, pulls at the heartstrings. I would compare it to the movie The Blind Side only without profanity or sexual content.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This is a cute, short read.  Yes, it's predictable, but most books are.  That didn't make it any less enjoyable.  I really liked the two main characters, and don't have anything negative to say.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Love the new version.  I die a lot but it's still fun trying to get to each level. I recommend this game.
B001B1CBSQ|5.0|The lyrics, beats, rhythm, melody, you'll love everything about this group. Too bad they broke up. L Boogie's MTV Unplugged recordings are great also.
B000SW4DP8|5.0|Awesome movie! I first saw parts of this movie at a family gathering, however due to constant interuptions and channel flippings I could not follow the plot. But, I did see enough of the movie  to order it from Amazon as soon as we got home. The movie was not exactly a &#34;everybody lives happily ever after&#34; sort, but it did portray the goodness in many people's hearts, regardlesss of where they live or how they live. Highly recommend it!
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|Hard to put down once you start. A great story-teller especially when dealing with topical subjects. She brings all the characters to life.
B0011UJMK2|1.0|too depressing. looking at the USA's  future, perhaps.<br />could not finish book . no &#34;character&#34; to like at all ,dark<br />and dismal
B00A9X9ORI|4.0|Saw the preview and it looked like a science fiction movie I would like to watch. I would recommend this to adults only.
B00A6VAW9W|5.0|Having been a loyal fan of Loggins and Messina, I just couldn't believe when an old disc jockey friend emailed me with a link of some LIVE Blue Sky Riders  April 2012. I was blown away by their backstage, warm-up harmonies. I started to watch the tour schedule and jumped on the chance to see them perform the now available CD LIVE last September. If you were ever a fan of the likes of Poco, Loggins and Messina and even America, you are just going to love this band and their first CD. They sing together like they have always been together. FINALLY....new music for me.....and I thought I'd have to stay stuck listening to oldies.
B00AE2LJVS|4.0|I didn't know how violent this movie was until I watched it.  Lots of blood.  I would recommend this to adults only.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|Everything was repetitive and boring.  Expected better than first.  Will definitely waste time or money on third. Vacation read, but skipped back to little women.
B005OP821K|5.0|I caught a current program of this series, and was hooked right away.  I bought Season 1, to catch up.  Would recommend this to adults.
B002JVWRAO|5.0|this was a Christmas gift for my fifteen year old grandson and he loved it, I would say it was a great gift
B0084BMUFA|4.0|A story which has been told many times in many forms. I am still fond of the plot, even though Charles Dickens is far from my favorite author. After reading it I stand by my original opinion that the Muppet Christmas Carol is one of the best!
B006X5L6VS|5.0|this has been fun for the grandkids I'm not sure how correct it is but they enjoy it, and there is lots of neat info
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this game. It has challenging levels but not so impossible where you want to give up. I found myself losing track of time so be careful. Its addicting!!
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|what's to say? it is Google and does what it is suppose to do. I don't use it slot but when I do its nice
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Helps me train to save Gotham City. Jumping, running, sliding down ropes, and faking my own death and coming back to life. Enough said.
B009O2XY12|5.0|My husband and I take turns playing this one. We both have had loads of fun playing it. We try to beat each other.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I loved the characters in this book.  This story was sad but was told so well...very enjoyable book and more depth than I was expecting!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Great game: both my 5 year old daughter &amp; I love it... we've even gotten my dad to play it non-stop!
B001P9EQH8|5.0|I am hard of hearing so the E5 was a delight to use. The highs are much cleaner than with just my ear buds and the lows are more definitive as well. It's compact powerful and very useable. I recommend the E5 to any ear budder out there who want better sound through their player.
B0035JRVBO|5.0|This movie is awesome. I want to watch it all the time, and them watch it some more. I love Forrest Gump
B0051ANPZQ|4.0|This novel gives insight into the feelings of a &#34;different&#34; kid and how he deals with his difference.... and how others view him.  There is such a lack of charity these days in children, mostly because they are not well formed in virtue - too much busyness in parents' lives to bother with it, and schools are handcuffed by the state to teach without moral directives, but this is a novel every parent should take the time to read with their older children.  The situation was presented in very real terms, both in the child's reactions to others, and even parents' reactions to him, some embracing his deformity while others steered their kids away from him.  Heart-wrenching, but very real.  In the end, a loving tale of how humanity can triumph over nature.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Starts off quite easy, but starts tickling the brain juices as it progresses!  Nice little time killer that can become addictive.
