B0054JZC6E|4.0|really enjoy this game.  keeps my kids entertained on road trips and waiting rooms.  takes awhile to unlock everything but nice that there are so many different games
B005LAIH4A|5.0|This is an awesome movie. the lorax is such a fun film full of lovable characters. i love this movie. i liked the animation, story and the songs in this film my favorite song is how bad can i bee. and another thing i like about this movie is the good message it represents. we do need to take care of our trees. this is a great movie for kids and adults. this movie is great for the whole family. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do
B0098VYKSA|2.0|Maybe because I'm not a fan of KS. Not at all.<br />Effects were great but overall: meh. Neither here nor there.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|This book caught me at a time in my life where I have questioned \\"time.\\" For example, I'm not sure I have enough \\"time\\" to learn a new craft. I'm not sure if I have enough \\"time\\" to read all the books I want to read.<br /><br />The story is about 3 people and how they relate to time - how they want to count it, how to make it last longer and how to destroy it. I identified most with Sara. She's a high school girl who is relatively friendless and not attractive, at least in her eyes. She wants so much to be accepted and, of course, that doesn't happen - in the way she expects. Other characters face different challenges that tore at my heart.<br /><br />\\"The Time Keeper\\" blew my mind. I found it to be easy to read and even easier to apply to my own life. This is an amazing read and I highly recommend it to everyone.
B008VBYN80|1.0|loved the game. hate the glitches. constantly glitching. not just me, my friends experiencing the same troubles. real shame because it completely ruins what would otherwise be fun.
B0061PEAUY|5.0|A little hard to get use to the French names and terms but once it got going it got going.  Great dynamics between the characters and many twists and turns to keep you from seeing the future action.
B0089ZEEYG|3.0|My granddaughter rates this three stars and says it is \\"okay\\".<br />It was free. Easy to play and fun to start, but does get boring.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Is it worth it to buy this? I don't want to use up ALL my money. Is it just as good as online
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Angry birds is really fun.  The different kinds of birds do different things.  This is different from the Ipad version.
B008MEM24S|5.0|This is a fun game.  It's not difficult for an adult - you could probably finish it entirely in a few hours.  But it has kept my 6yo daughter busy at her brother's baseball games.  And you gotta love the Maj. Monogram and Doofenschmirtz voiceovers.
B005NKGEP2|3.0|I'll admit that the main reason I purchased this book (on Kindle) was because, like the protagonist in the novel, at one time I was also an expat living in Luxembourg. I have to say that the author does a great job of capturing some of the daily routines, sights and overall feeling of being an expat in Luxembourg. On top of that, the book is an enjoyable read, and certainly there is plenty of adventure in the book.<br /><br />On the downside, the author continually shifts back and forth between the present day and earlier periods, incrementally revealing more of the plot as the story progresses. While I understand the reason for this technique, it became a little wearisome after a while, and I felt that it was used to mask an overly linear plot development. In addition, the plot became a little too far-fetched and stretched the bounds of credibility later in the book.<br /><br />If you enjoy spy vs spy intrigue and don't mind compromises in plot and character development, the book is fine. If you're interested in the nature of American expat life, the book is enlightening. At the end of the day, I came down firmly in the middle on the book. I enjoyed reading it, but I don't know if it is for everyone.
B000FC13E0|4.0|Exciting and suspenseful. Too bad it turned into a horror flick with the grossness of the dead bodies. That part when the hero got his foot stuck in the chest of his teammate was especially hokey.<br /><br />The entire hive felt like it was out of a alien-like horror movie. I was kind of frustrated that it took them so long to figure out that the virus could defeat the e. coli assemblers. The plot dragged on and on as they tried to fight it with conventional weapons, blowing up things, etc. I had already figured out that Julia was colonized by the particles. I also don't like the loose end about the cause of the accident. Perhaps the real Julia wanted out, but the particle man caused her to crash.<br /><br />A bit slow at the beginning, but picked up after the rabbit died.
B0083ZRAJS|4.0|This was a nice story with a lot of subtle jokes throughout the book. I recommend reading the book before watching the movie.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I liked the sequel and could it get tedious at times but I stuck with it because with Sylvia Day books there is always a reward at the end.  It takes awhile sometimes to get to it but it is always worth it. I think the reason for the change in the book is because she published Bared To You independently and this is through a publisher.  The publisher has made her change the name of this book 2 times since this series has been picked up by them and that should tell you something of the content of the book and what they had a hand in her editing.  I just wanted to put out to the other publishing houses please stop with all these books with \\"Fifty Shades of Gray\\" in their titles.<br /><br />In my opinion I think the point in her taking the self defense was about her not feeling defenseless anymore and it helped with her self esteem.  I was kind of disappointed that the police did not pursue the investigation but they ran into a road block and hey Gideon becomes a murderer but Nathan was awful and sorry deserved to rot in prison or die.  I don't know why everyone is surprised when he said he would kill for her and was methodical enough to put it together.<br /><br />I think Corinne is sleeping with the brother Christopher because it is the next best thing.  I don't remember if it was Corinne who had slept with him in Bared To You but I know someone did as I did not reread the book before this came out.  I knew when they police said Nathan was dead who had done it and why and the reason Gideon was acting so strange.  I knew Eva's mother had that reaction that she had seen Nathan outside the building.  I also suspected that Nathan had attacked Cary because he was close to Eva and wanted to get him out of the way.  I do think we should have heard something from Nathan and what made him so twisted so young as a small part of the story but it is what it is.<br /><br />What I think with Entwined With You is we will find out that it was Dr. Terrence Lucas who was the other therapist (or someone he knew) and who abused Gideon and the reason for Gideon going after his wife or something like that.  It might be that just because Dr. Lucas lied about the exam that he went after his wife.  I want to know why Christopher and the doctor lied.  Gideon's mother is an idiot and should have believed her child unconditionally and frankly I would have been in that room when he examined to make sure everything was good (or her current husband).  He would not have been examined without one of this parents in that room.<br /><br />I didn't even address the sex in this book and I thought some of it was hot hot hot and how can I jump my husband.  Some of it I was like wow I don't think guys like him exist.  I didn't meet any of them in my single days and I don't know if that is good or bad and it is too late now<br /><br />I think everything will be cleared up in the final book and I can't wait to read it!

B008G12ERC|5.0|The album starts with Rage Against the Machine by way of a James Bond movie, and ends with dubstep and the END OF THE FRIGGIN' WORLD, and nothing in between those bookends makes any more sense than either of them, and it's fabulous.<br /><br />\\"But I like my music and albums to maintain a coherency and a general sense of order an--\\"  BYE.  Go away.  Wrong album for you.  Matt Bellamy appears to be a musical Godzilla who can do whatever he wants and has decided to just go ahead and do that, without regard for his listeners' or his own sanity.<br /><br />And good for all of us.  I liked many of their previous albums.  This one outshines them all on pure balls and pure comically unfettered creative adrenaline.<br /><br />The highlight of the album without question is the duo of \\"2nd Law\\" tracks at the end.  One of my fellow critics here dismissed them with a simple \\"these are not songs.\\"<br /><br />I guarantee, if you agree with him, you will dislike this album.  But if you sit there listening with a goofy grin on your face, feet subconsciously tapping out the bass drum lines, awash with the excitement of something which didn't exist before, and wondering how the same band that made this made the dance-pop \\"Panic Station\\" or any of the other inexplicable joy that came before it, well, you'll get it.  And you got it.<br /><br />FIVE STARS.  If you don't like it, your soul has died.

0385344333|5.0|I could not put this book down.  Housework and everything else went by the wayside.  Lee Child is a master at keeping one in suspense, even though you know in your heart that Jack Reacher will survive.  By the way, who broke his nose???  I don't think we ever found out![[ASIN:0385344333 A Wanted Man: A Jack Reacher Novel]]
B003O86FMW|4.0|Was a good read, seemed a bit short as it only took only about two days to read it from start to finish but I pretty much never put it down.
B005X5XIL0|5.0|Anyone that has listened to Andrea Bocelli will agree that there is something magical in his voice that reaches deep into the soul.  It isn't necessary to understand the language to become completely engaged.  The addition of the other great singers sharing in the wonderful Italian Operas made the DVD a delightful experience, but so did the renditions of pop music done in grand American style.  No one could imagine an opera singer swinging the song, \\"More\\", and so effortlessly.  The flute, trumpet and violin accompanying this marvelous voice in selections transports you to another musical high.  Don't miss his duet with Tony Bennett singing, \\"I Love New York\\".  There is so much in this video to please everyone in your household.  Make it a family event.  Spend an evening with this DVD, and it will be a night to remember.
B0044XRIMW|5.0|In this sequel to \\"The Hills Have Eyes\\" The Sound of Music - is the creepy tale of a  governess who disguised as a nun plans to gain a wealthy position as a Captains wife. She goes to the hills when she needs to communicate with Satan, but as a nun her peers think she is going so she can communicate with God. The conflict between good and evil has never been presented in a more interesting way. It is the most creative musical ever made. The haunting overtones of \\"Do Re Mi\\" & \\"Climb Every Mountain\\" will make your skin crawl, as do the performances  of the entire cast , which is chillingly & thrillingly led by \\"Oscar\\" winner Julia Van Drews in the lead role as Maria Von Trapped.

B005LAII9Y|5.0|I just went and saw this and enjoyed it so much that I'm writing my first ever review on Amazon about it. Check out C. Sawin's review (no affiliation) for a more in-depth look. From a personal perspective, I found it touching, funny and done in classic Tim Burton style (great story, great visuals, faceted quirky characters who are lovable because of their quirks). It definitely feels more like -him- at his truest nature and has his own funny quirkiness all over it, much like Nightmare, Edward Scissorhands, Corpse Bride, and his Vincent short (vs. Alice, Batman, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory). At its heart is a sweet story of a boy's love for his dog, Sparky. Around that is an array of characters that reference horror movies, a tribute to Vincent Price (whose brief monologue at the town meeting is hilarious), mainstream townspeople who end up coming to Sparky's aid, and a delightfully odd girl (seems like Luna Lovegood done in Tim Burton style) with her even more odd cat (who has fortune telling poop). I went to see his artwork exhibit at the MoMA and LACMA and this movie is very much along the lines of his drawings and doodles, which is what I consider to be classic Tim Burton, like who he is as an artist for himself. I highly recommend you go see this movie.
B004JN1D2I|2.0|This is what would likely happen if steven king started writing contemporary fantasy. And I'm not praising this series.<br /><br />George has a habit killing off characters right after he's managed to make you attached to them, and I personally don't appreciate it. It's more suited to a horror story. If that is what you want in a book, you will appreciate this series. Think of it as a book to be read with a frozen heart - the less you care about any character, the better off you will be. Oh, and due to this same fact, you are often forced into the viewpoints of characters you would normally not want to read about, untill you want to read about them. Then they die.<br /><br />The series could not be more aptly named than \\"Game of Thrones\\". It is literally about the power-play among the royal, the ambitious, the cunning and everyone in-between. There is no black and white, and I can resentfully say that this is the first book that made me hate the whole \\"shades of grey\\" concept.  Buy a sample of the first book stand-alone and read it to be sure you want this want BEFORE picking this up. Because you could end up hooked into reading a series you don't like at all. Hope this helped.

0525953728|5.0|I liked reading \\"No Easy Day\\" because it was very informative. I didn't say I enjoyed reading it because the material content wasn't necessarily pleasant. Hearing from an Elite Navy Seal, his extensive training, and an account of his team's missions was both exciting as well as informative. My only difficulty was keeping track of all the acronyms being used. What these Seals do, first their torturous training, then their unbelievable missions that are seemingly carried out flawlessly even though adjustment must always be made. There is no doubt in my mind that I could never meet the standards of a Navy Seal and, as an American, it makes me very proud that our country has such an elite group that helps keep our country safe. I'M PROUD TO BE AN AMERICAN and learn about the CREME DE LA CREME of our Navy. THE SEAL Team six!! Thank you to all our SEALS!!

B00005JKLZ|4.0|Its been about thirty years since I've seen the 1960 version of H.G. Wells \\"The Time Machine\\" directed by George Pal starring Rod Taylor.  If memory serves it was more comic book than genuine sci-fi.  Thougn the effects won an Oscar they were kind of cheesy and the Morlock makeup was borderline laughable.  Regardless, I have an affinity for that film.  It's probably why I like the original \\"Star Trek\\" more than its more technologically more proficient antecedents or the original \\"King Kong\\".  I recently saw a repeat of \\"The Big Bang Theory\\" where the boys bought a time machine and they referenced the 1960 version and not the 1992 version.  Telling? So what is wrong with the 1992 version?  Nothing that I can put my finger on.  It's a handsome looking production with state of the art effects that make the original's look like \\"Plan 9 From Outer Space\\".  The Morlock makeup effects on display here make the original's look like DIY Halloween costumes.  The performances are above par.  It deviates from the original story by positing some interesting theories about how you can't change the past but you can change the future.  It isn't a soulless remake because it was directed by Wells' great-grandson, Simon Wells.  I think it's just one of those things.  One can only honestly judge this film if you divorce yourself from whatever impact the 1960 version had on you.

B007UPNA6Y|1.0|The story is ordinary, the characters predictable and the whole thing inconsequential.  The other recent Jack Reacher novels were far better, such as 61 Hours and The Affair.  Lee Child certainly seems to have taken a step backwards with this very simple effort.

1423140605|5.0|Hi. My name is Merin, and I am a Percy Jackson addict.<br /><br />I love Percy the way a mother loves her child. I am blind to his faults, and adore him even when he's being a sarcastic pain in the ass. My feelings for him are such that I am physically incapable of giving this book anything less than five stars. Even though Percy isn't the main point of view character he was in his title series, these books are what they are because of him, and his involvement makes it nearly impossible for me to be objective.<br /><br />That being said? This book is absolutely FABULOUS.<br /><br />The elements that made the previous installments so great are ever-present in THE MARK OF ATHENA. You still have the humor, the action, and the emotional journeys of the characters. And most of all, you still have Percy being Percy. Except this is a more mature, more tested, more grown up Percy. He's still hilarious, still the character who says things he shouldn't. But he's also the guy who is totally in love with Annabeth, and their relationship is what's really at the heart of this book. Yes, they're trying to figure out how to keep Gaea from waking, and they're going to have to reunite the Greek and Roman camps. But what the previous two books have taught us is that their feelings for each other - their inability to live without the other - have created what is probably the best \\"One True Pair\\" of all time. NO ONE will ever be able to compare to Percy and Annabeth, and that's saying something when you consider that they're not even seventeen yet.<br /><br />\\"Yeah,\\" Percy said. \\"I learned a long time ago: NEVER bet against Annabeth.\\" - 53%<br /><br />Of course, I can wax poetically about how awesome Percy and Annabeth are together until the end of days, and it still will only encompass part of what made this book so fantastic. The truth is, Annabeth ROCKS this book. She is tough, headstrong, and stubborn, and while she is confronted with some very serious weaknesses, she never gives up, even when things are going against her. Honestly, if you have ANYTHING bad to say about Annabeth after reading this book, please do it elsewhere, because I will be like Octavian in that dock scene; I will be unable to hear you over the wax in my ears. I don't know what the next book is going to bring for Annabeth and Percy, but I have faith that they will be able to overcome whatever it is just because they are together, and as Annabeth said in this book, being with Percy always makes her feel braver. And she's definitely going to need a whole lot of that.<br /><br />Now, just so this doesn't dissolve into a Annabeth and Percy lovefest, here were some other things I loved about this book. The return of the \\"dam\\" joke. The Jason/Percy bromance; I really think these two can be best buds forever. Leo being absolutely kick-ass, and the way he felt like an outsider and became such an integral part of the quest. Piper's brief moments of being awesome (I wish there was more of this and less of her waxing on about Jason). The Hazel and Leo backstory. Jason and Percy working together. The glimpses of the gods and goddesses. Aphrodite's tea party. The ever-present humor interspersed with all the action and adventure. The way that all seven demigods have realized that they can't do this alone and are going to have to work together. The way Riordan combined the Greek and Roman stories together. Reyna. The scene where Annabeth drops her dagger and Percy is awesome. Annabeth's ability to face her worst fear. The Percy/Annabeth reunion scene. All of the Annabeth backstory, which answered nearly every single question I had about her. All of the absolutely hilarious lines.<br /><br />To sum up: this book was everything I wanted it to be, and more. I love that we got an Annabeth point of view, and I absolutely adored her voice. There were lots of achy-breaky moments in this book, but it just made everything seem more realistic, and it hurt in the good way. Be forewarned, though, that if you read this book, you're going to want the next one immediately. My only complaint is that we're going to have to wait another year to learn what happens next! I'm definitely starting the countdown for THE HOUSE OF HADES. How about you?at if you read this book, you're going to want the next one immediately. My only complaint is that we're going to have to wait another year to learn what happens next! I'm definitely starting the countdown for THE HOUSE OF HADES. How about you?

B0084B1T8Y|3.0|This book was an interesting book but I had a hard time getting into the whole thing. Also it was hard to read because it was written in olden language. I think if they rewrote the book in an easier way to read it everyone would be happy including me. But overall I liked this book.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Although things always seemed to move along, it seemed that most of the moving was done during the car chases from state to state and back.

B008MG1E4A|5.0|Very good story.  Nothing that would give our enemies any informantion taht they would not already know.  A non political account of the day Bin Laden was killed.  Why would the government want to punish this man when?
B002QKZLZ6|5.0|Exactly as described. Use it in my backpack to prevent damage. Easy to get earpiece in and out of case but takes a bit of practice to get it folded properly. No plans to wear it on belt.
B007FEFLTO|3.0|This a good attempt to take a difficult period in world history and bring it down to a personal and more understandable level. Unfortunately, the events of the time were not on a soap opera level rather the barberism exhibited throughout is not really comprehensible on a moral level.<br />Nevertheless, the book is a page-turner and I look forward to the last instalment.The barbarities of Hitler and Stalin are far beyond human comprehension and the characters that Follett created struggle to deal with these evil titans.
B005I4JG80|5.0|Loved this book. As someone who is looking forward to having children soon, I really enjoyed the practical advice here. Makes me have hope that children can behave with civility instead of screaming every time they are in public!
B007SSDS24|3.0|The Darkest Hour is an interesting concept on an old formula Aliens attack earth and make a mess of things.  What I would have liked to see is more character development.  You have your classic corporate raider turned girlie putz yet I am not sure why he was there.  More could have been made of his evil nature you know one on the aliens and one eye on him.  The wrong people die in this flic and it still does not propel the story forward.  I was hoping for an Independance Day type ending instead the film just ended.  Arrg!Overall an hour and a half was probably a half an hour too long.  Still, boy gets girl and alien boody gets kicked.  To the director, microwave those suckers in the rain, hit them with a massive EMP and blow a few million of them up.  First find where they come from and then send a few navy seals to kick a**.

B005LAIISU|5.0|Went to see this latest version of Ice Age on July 13, 2012 along with a 5 and 11 year old girls and their Grandpa. Grandpa fell asleep with 10 min's of the movie beginning (due to the HOT TX. weather outside!) and the 5 year old was interested...on/off! But myself and the 11 year old loved it!! She can hardly wait until the DVD (or Blu-Ray) comes out so I can buy it for her! I also liked the Ice Age Christmas DVD but as the kids said..\\"it was too short\\"!!<br />I HOPE there will be more future versions coming out!! It's refreshing to see a movie that doesn't have all the violence, bang-bang, shoot them or blown them up or High-Speed chases in it!! No wonder kids now-a-days are 'messed up' (to put it mildly) and bullies!!! Violence in the Movies, TV and Video Games! Oh, We saw this movie at our local theatre and NOT on Blu-Ray.

B004JVZXXU|1.0|Saw the first movie, which I tolerated, but this one was boring. I ended up fast forwarding much of this movie. It was a free rental for Amazon Prime and I still think I paid too much. If you really liked the first movie you will like this, if you didn't skip the rental, even if free, and go to something better.
B007GCY8FS|1.0|I have read all Lee Child's books and eagerly look forward to new releases. This has been the first time I was let down. The book read very slowly and the ending was a let down. I hope this is the first and last time this happens.

B001FD5KJM|3.0|Robert Downey, Jr. does about as good a job with the lead character as anyone could, and the acting is pretty good overall, but the special effects are just OK, the plot is somewhat juvenille, and the portrayal of the Afghan bad guys is laughably stereotypical.  I watched this movie with the family (not my choice of movie), and it wasn't a total waste of time, but I do wish the time had been better spent.

B002BU0DPE|3.0|PROS:<br />-Great control of game and voice<br />-Excellent sound<br />-Long cord<br />-Use for PC, PS3, or Xbox 360<br />-One year warranty<br /><br />CONS:<br />-Cord coils too easily<br />-Not durable: 1st set lasted 6 months and mic quit abruptly.  2nd set lasted 6 months and sound went out immediately in 1 ear<br />-Warranty information buried deep in the Turtlebeach website.  Exchange was not an easy process. 3-4 week to replace headset but new headset does not come with a warranty.<br /><br />Bottom line:  If you have money to blow and can replace the $70 headset every 6 months then go for it.  If you want durability find a different headset.

B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Great book.  It follows the trials and tribulations of an otherwise very lost soul as he moves from drug addiction to a true American hero, until his death during a mission in Afghanistan, another Viet Nam.  He truly shows everyone how to rise above adversity, external and internal.
B000OIZUW6|4.0|A compelling visit back to a time when wars were fought with wits, not technology.  It keeps WWII alive for us.
B009GEAPYW|1.0|For casual viewers of the Batman movies please be aware this is an animated movie and not the 2012 movie starring Christian Bale.  We ordered this on Amazon Instant Video through our blu-ray player unaware we were not purchasing the version mentioned above (the fact it is the animated version is not in the description). Needless to say I was charged for the movie even though I only watched 3 minutes of it and Amazon does not allow any refunds on digital content. (I was not particularly In the mood for an animated film) I'm sure some will take issue with me posting a negative review about this particular movie but I feel it is necessary to call out what I feel was intentionally deceptive labeling. Yes, we were caught off guard by it...hopefully this doesn't to other viewers as well.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|I did not enjoy this book as I have the other Jack Reacher stories.  I felt it was bogged down with too much detail----  about munitions, about areas where action took place, about the various agencies of the government etc, etc.  I found myself skipping large portions of the novel, hoping to get past the endless detail to more interesting material.  It never happened.  Even the ending was week.  Jack shooting everyone then being \\"saved\\" at the very last moment. Very disappointing story line.
B00457X7XQ|3.0|Zero Day has been around for a while but unlike a good wine it will not improve with age. A fair first novel but thats all. You just cant escape from the fact it is only a fair story, written only fairly, no more! I am a geek so the technical correctness is appreciated but the formulaic plot development and the average writing style does not make for a great work of literature.

B0098WWEH8|5.0|Different from last album, not as much as an odyssey. More of a dynamically-paced, episodic singalong. Very masterpiece in the sense that not many other bands can walk down this path and actually produce a substantive track-to-track listen-thru album. I'm overjoyed by this release and recommend it highly.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I really like this game.  I find that I cannot stop playing.  You have to wait to collect coins but I do not mind.
1400069289|3.0|I was very disappointed.  I just couldn't see the relationship between a manufacturer trying to get the public to buy its product (presumably by making its purchase a habit) and the habits, good or bad, of the individual.  I only read the section of the book that dealt with individuals, and could find nothing helpful in it at all.

B009157BWU|5.0|This movie was just plain wonderful.  Sweet, funny, moving, and absolutely gorgeous.  The amount of hard work and love put into this project is obvious.  It's a little sad at one point, but if your kid was ok with Bambi, they'll be ok here.  And the movie as a whole will be a great experience for both adults and kids alike.  I was still smiling when I thought about it days later.

B0081SRJSY|5.0|I first saw this game from a distance, and was instantly intrigued. No dice, no board, just a bunch of tiles, a little strategy, and a whole lot of fun. Every game is different; every game is unique. Best played with 3 or 4 people, but loads of fun just one on one. You won't be disappointed.

B009GFEOY8|2.0|I'm still waiting for The Impossible Project to make a film comparable in quality and convenience to Polaroid's old film.  Based on the hype on the Impossible Project's website, I had hoped that this film would be it.  On the plus side, it was fun to see my old SX-70 power up again after all these years, but at $3.00 per shot, this film's convenience, color, and image quality pale in comparison to Polaroid's $1.50 per shot trouble-free Time Zero film.  I will not buy this film again.

B008NW67E0|4.0|I thought the album was solid and was what I expected from Mumford and Sons. Most of the reviews saying \\"they didn't change their sound enough\\" would be the same people griping and moaning that they \\"changed too much\\" if they had strayed from their roots. Bottom line: If you love Mumford and Sons, you will love this album.  It's familiar, but still has enough depth and change to be new and exciting.
B00008G7UF|4.0|enjoyable romantic comedy, especially if you like Meg Ryan or Kevin Kline.  Bought this and Bottle Shock for an amateur wine making friend.  Settle in with a good Cabernet and it's a great double feature...

B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Nice app. Fun time waster.  My children love it as well.  Coins regenerate a bit slow,  but no money needed to enjoy.
B00943SQCI|5.0|Why on earth viewers would compare it to some old show and miss what this movie gave is beyond me.  I know nothing of the old 'Dark Shadows' and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  Johnny Depp's acting was superb, as always ... that alone can derive pleasure from the movie.  The special effects were unique and quite good.  Humorous in spots and dark in others.  I was thoroughly entertained, as likely most will be who aren't wrapped up in some cult classic.
B005LAIHPE|5.0|I could  not take my eyes off the screen. Loved the action, the dialogue and the amazingly well done visuals. I did not pick up this movie to be sucked into it so much, just a fun action packed movie. Which it was, but it was above and beyond anything I expected.
B007UPNA6Y|5.0|As usual Lee Child does not disappoint.  I love Jack Reacher and this book brings you more of the mystery, thrills and humour.  The character stays true and the story is fast moving.
B009B50QOU|1.0|I was trying to give these guys a chance but they still make the same shit they have been doing...they need a style change immediately
B005LAIHY0|1.0|I was astonished at how stupid, ridiculous and boring this film was, and how the producers and script writers, when not rehashing the elements from the original Alien, were busily stealing plot elements and ideas from other authors and film  makers. In the beginning of the film, we are shown an alien who for some reason dies. But there is no explanation as to what is going on or why--like it was tacked on as an afterthought. Flash forward, from the present, to 70 years into the future--a future that seems no different than present day. Seventy years from now explorers using the standard  tools of the 19th century, find a cave and within the cave we see 6 stars above a lion--and this is an amazing discovery 70 years from now and it means that prehistoric men understood astronomy! Astonishing, right?  In a book edited by Sir Roger Penrose [[ASIN:0982955200 Consciousness and the Universe: Quantum Physics, Evolution, Brain & Mind]] there is a chapter on \\"Paleolithic Cosmology\\" which reproduced cave paintings from Lascaux, the \\"Hall of the Bulls\\" and detailed how above the back of one of these charging bulls, appears a grouping of 6 stars, which the author believed represented the \\"Pleiades\\" which is associated with the constellation of Taurus. Yes, somehow this was lifted and found its way into Promethsus, and it becomes  the reason why a space ship is sent to the Pleiades--but without any explanation. Hey, they are pointing at stars, lets send a space ship and meet our creators--the engineers. What? This is not just a leap of logic, it makes no sense. The plot of the book, [[ASIN:B005JE2FKU Life and Death on the Red Planet The Pyramids of Mars: Genetics in the Garden of Eden. The Adventures of the First Mars Colony]](which was published by the same publisher), centers on the exploration of a hollow diamond shaped mountain on Mars which reveals, thanks to holograms created by the aliens, the secrets of advanced alien race which genetically engineered and created modernhumans. Then some of this alien DNA is activated, and some of the human on Mars start becoming just like the original aliens. Surprise! We get the same plot in Prometheus, except in Prometheus it doesn't make any sense. OK--so the major aspects of Prometheus were just lifted from books and authors published by Cosmology Science publishers, and then these jokers who made Prometheus tried to pass this material off as original ideas about our origins. Then  there is the scene where the two scientists are lost inside the hollow mountain/space ship, and this reptilian creature rises up, stares at them, they remark on how cute it is, then it unfolds a fan like ornament/appendage around its neck and attacks--and this is taken right out of the film Jurassic Park. The list of thievery goes on and on in this film in search of a plot.<br /><br />Then there is the really bad, often, really stupid acting. No plot, bad acting--its like a B-movie but with a 200 million dollar budget and almost no special effects worth mentioning. The movie is so stupid, the actors act like such idiots, the plot is so ridiculous... How could Ridley Scott produce such crap?<br /><br />There is nothing original  or \\"science fiction\\" about this boring ridiculous movie which really didn't make any sense--which is probably because the film-makers were so busy stealing from other people, they didn't have time to develop a plot or come up with anything original. When they make part 2 of this film, one can only wonder who they are going to steal from next.<br /><br />Final verdict. Boring, inane, stupid, a mishmash of other people's idea and work, coupled with some really bad acting and no plot.
B009KHCT94|3.0|OK this is the strangest SciFi I have seen since Ice Pirates.  It really defies description. It was entertaining to that end.
B00992CF6W|4.0|This game is really fun.  However, the game is lacking in a few places.  The worlds are too small and it is lacking items and features that the PC and even the Xbox360 versions have.  It's still worth the price though.
1401324649|4.0|The story starts when Allan climbs out his window in order to avoid going to his 100th birthday party at the old folks home.  From there he wanders through Sweden collecting around him a motley assortment of characters. He also, in flashbacks, wanders through major events of the 20th century and his own role in them.  At various times it is a rollicking buddy story, at times a history lesson, and at times a commentary on life, love, politics, religion, and war.  It works on all the levels because of Allen's basic likability, his live and let live attitude, and because of his total lack of interest in politics and religion while others are all riled about one or both.  Highly recommend.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Getting a new Ken Follett, for me, is a double-edged sword; on the one hand I can't wait to open it, and on the other hand, once I do, the laundry doesn't get done, the vacuuming doesn't get done, and my family is lucky to get anything to eat until I finish the book. Since he changed direction from the spy thrillers that started his career (and which didn't particularly interest me), he has chosen complex, interesting subjects with characters the reader will care deeply about and a story that makes you sorry the book has ended! I can't wait for the third volume of the Century Trilogy to appear, and I hope he has other weighty subjects in mind for his next efforts. Be sure to read these books in order or you will be hopelessly confused--but DO read them!!
B0092SPYQG|4.0|It's about time they have made a good album. This album is truly an album they have been waiting to make. All of the greatest elements are put together to create a great CD.

B007PFD90G|5.0|The writing in this memoir effectively captures the emotional trauma of the writer facing the dangerous time of his life. His ability to survive this trauma while still showing us his comic and narrative genius makes this one of the best non-fiction for the year.

034580404X|5.0|I was unsure what I was going to think of the Shades of Grey series.  From what I understood of BDSM it did not sound like anything I would ever want to read about.  I was glad that I gave it a chance.  The book is now my favorite romance novel.  It is very important to read the entire first novel because even though this book is advertise to be about BDSM, there is a wonderful romantic love story that unfolds and with each book this relationship only gets better and better<br /> The book truly is more about a couple who loves each other so much that they will overcome obstacles to keep from losing one another.  I passed this book onto a friend who never would have selected this book otherwise and she loved it as well.
B000TEMRIU|4.0|While some albums from this genre (and time) haven't held up well to the ravages of time, Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness still pulls one's attention in and won't let go until the last chord is just an echo radiating from your speakers.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Lee Child is one of my favorite authors, and his novels with Jack Reacher are supurb.  A Wanted Man may be his best yet.  Do yourself a favor and read \\"all\\" of the Jack Reacher Novels.  You will find they are hard to put down.

B007GCY8FS|3.0|\\"A Wanted Man\\" fell short of my expectations. The ending seemed rushed and left a lot of loose ends. We need antothe book to finish this story.

1451648537|2.0|So I picked up this book at the local library a few weeks ago. I was mildly interested in the book, but I am no means a Jobs' worshiper nor do I idolize anything made by Apple. While I do have an IPad, I don't revolve my life around these gadgets which in a few years will be rusting and rotting in a landfill. There is no use in life to worship inanimate objects.<br /><br />I remember when the book came out: the news websites were chattering about it for a while. I remember the gist of the some of the news at the time mentioning that Jobs was portrayed in the book as arrogant and I guess the word might be manipulative.  I hadn't read the book at that point yet, but I did read some blogs at that time and I remember not being impressed.<br />Imagine my surprise when I got into the book. That initial analysis seemed to permeate from every chapter and every critical situation in Job's life. It seemed that every story contained some example of how he got what he wanted through domineering or manipulative behavior. It seemed that every story contained evidence of arrogance or hubris or some victim. I didn't keep a mathematical tally of all the stats for each story, but the narrative of the book was overflowing enough to easily convey this impression.<br /><br />I will leave with a more positive note. I appreciated Isaacson's ability to become transparent in telling the story without interjecting himself into the narrative. So I think Isaacson did us a service by trying to write as truthfully as possible.<br /><br />This is a book that I will never read again, I simply can't read about such a character twice.

What I love about this book is that it lays out a diet that we can follow for life in a simple way.  If you really give the McDougall diet, or basically any whole-food, plant based diet, for a couple of months you will never want to go back.
B004LWZWGK|1.0|Wow. I felt like this was a ruff cut of the movie. Bane? What did he say. Can barely understand him. Jim Gordon ? Great character turned into a almost a bumbling fool. Send all the police force down into bane's hide out. What!!!  Go after batman and not the terrorist who has a hostage strapped to the back of his motorcycle. What!!!  Batman stops to look at some files as he is surrounded by police and just does a general lee and jumps over everyone and escapes. What!!  SPOILER. Robin...... What!!!!!  Uh dick Greyson maybe or even Jason Todd. Could have sort of saved the movie to set some kind of batman beyond hope. I could go on. Wow.  People search your feelings you know this to be true. Did u walk out of the theatre in silence too. Wow.  Sorry for the one star. I was not allowed to leave no stars.

B007GCY8FS|5.0|In his travelog fashion Lee Child continues Jack Reacher's quest to meet the \\"woman with a nice voice\\" in Virginia.  Reacher is still wearing the duct tape band aide that he used to tape together his nose which was busted by the butt of a shotgun.  Moving across the country via hitch hiking on an east west interstate during the winter Reacher contemplates the possibility of being picked up late at night and the type of traveler who might be willing to pickup a large rough looking man whose face is taped together.  After being passed by several vehicles and standing with one foot on the pavement for alomost 90 minutes a car finally rolls to a stop short of where Reacher has his thumb out.  He notices the group of 3 people in the car engage in a conversation and the lone women who is sitting in the rear seat finally nodding her head yes.  Only the \\"yes\\" wasn't what Reacher thought it was.  The newly formed group continues east and when Reacher is asked to drive his turn, the mystery and trouble begin.  Soon and sure enough Reacher finds himself neck deep in an international terrorist scheme and becomes a \\"Wanted Man\\"  Child's ability to take even a mundane scene and describe the scene to the point that the reader can actually sense the temperature, colors, textures and odors is unmatched.  Child's characters are both realist and believable.  The depth to which Child describes the landscapes and how the landscape and buildings help to shape the action of the story which he telling is a unique talent that draws the reader to see, feel and hear the action going on around the characters.  Reacher is once again a teacher, leader and trustworthy friend to those who are smart enough to listen to him.  Lee Child's ability to keep the reader interested in the story without resorting to use of carnal activities is wonderful for the reader whose interest is the action of the story rather than explicit sex.  SPOILER ALERT:  At the end of the story Reacher once again resumes his journey to Virginia, and I can't wait to find out where Reacher ends up next.
0812974611|4.0|Attilius's occupation is an aquarius in the Roman Empire, a job description that nowadays would be \\"director of waterworks operations and maintenance for the southern district of Italy.\\" As the earth beings to swell and shake in ominous warning in advance of the tragedy that is to come, the main aqueduct cracks and fails and Attilius is sent out to repair it. So this is a historical novel and we learn of life in the Roman Empire around AD 79 at the time of the eruption of Vesuvius. Here are masters and slaves, filthy rich and beggars. We get a little romance as Attilius meets the lovely daughter of a viscous, cunning landlord who used to be a slave himself. We learn a lot about Roman culture: meals, daily life, transportation technology, ships, soldiers, relations between men and women, political and financial corruption, and the unique role of the baths in Roman culture. It's an old fashioned boy gets girl despite obstacles romance story during a fast-paced hectic three-day period between when the aqueduct fails and the volcano blows. We learn about the aqueduct system, tunnels, reservoirs and siltation tanks. We learn of famous real-life Romans such as the general and prolific scholar Pliny the Elder and his nephew, Pliny the Younger.

B007TBZ63Y|5.0|i loved this book. i could bearly put it down. once you start the series you can't stop. i started the series over the summer and it was almost impossible to put down. i finished the first 2 books in one week it was  perfect. rick riordin did an another amazing job on these books. once i found out that the mark of athena cames out in october i was so anxious ti see what would happen. i waited for mounths and i was extreamly exited when it came out. [spoiler alert] the first chapter is narrirated by annabeth which in the past couple books has been searching for percy. leo was as funny as ever just almost always cracking jokes. jason always seemed to be hurt and piper was alwayss helping him out. percy was the same as he was in the past as always very, very loyal to annabeth and everyone else him and Jason  always seemed to see whose better but in the end they ended up believing they work better as a team. annabeth gets badly hurt while following the mark of athena. when her friends and percy finally end up saving her you think &#34;aww how sweet percy and she are all back together they're gonna finish the quest and live happily ever after&#34; but no there ends up being a spider web caaught around annabeths ankle. well believe it or not the wep goes strait down to tarterus. no one ends up cutting it so percy holds her hand as they hover over tarterus and annabeth tells percy to let her go but instead of her they both drop in to tarterus. nico declars them not dead and everyone feels bad they didnt save them. the ending really bumed me out!!!!!!!!!! so as a recap awesome read but ending bumed me out.

B000O77SOK|5.0|I love this set of Plan A / Plan B DVD's.  I was a dedicated fan of 'The Practice' and wish there were reruns on cable but unfortunately I had to resort to this. You're guaranteed to love this set of 4 discs; 13 episodes.  Some of the best!  I'm still awaiting Volume Two.

030758836X|5.0|I won't waste time going over the plot points, or giving a synopsis.  In fact, this book is so much better if you don't know a whole lot of information going in.  It starts off seeming like your average first person crime/suspense novel, then you get the added bonus of the missing woman's perspective from her secret diary entries.  This holds up as a good read on its own. Then half way through, just when you think maybe you are starting to figure things out, a huge twist gets thrown in the mix.  Things get 10 times more interesting, and the twists and intrigue just keep coming after that, right up until the very end!  Some people will likely hate the ending of this book, the same people who hated the ending of \\"LOST\\" or \\"The Sopranos\\", the folks who like everything to be tied up into a neat knot and bow at the end. So few things in life have a tidy ending, and in my opinion the ending was almost perfect.  I won't elaborate, as it would give to much away.<br /><br />On another note, I loved how the author cast light on an issue that I think is a huge problem right now.  How a person's guilt is so often decided in the media instead of a court of law.  How so called \\"tv journalists\\" make their careers by convicting a person before their trial, and persecuting them in the media regardless of the verdict, regardless of the truth, and regardless of who is hurt by it.  And they will keep doing it, because people lap it up!  People who have no knowledge of the case, beyond what is leaked, to the news, will condemn and gleefully judge.  Will ask \\"why the police aren't doing anything about it?\\" as if a case can be built, solved, and tried in an hour just like on tv. If it happened to you or someone you love, you'd be outraged.  So please think about that the next time you spend hours watching coverage of the \\"Casey Anthony\\" trial, or whoever the next media scapegoat is.  Whether they are guilty or not is for a jury to decide, not for the media to cash in on.  We can blame themedia for being irresponsible all we want, but the bottom line is, they wouldn't do it if we didn't keep making them rich off of it.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Can´t wait to read the third. I love you Ken Follett!!! You really know how to transport us to the world within your pages.I feel I am right there and then.
B000SEGUDE|3.0|I found the book confusing and hard to follow. The parts written in dialect are incredibly hard to follow, especially since the dialect is related to a future society that is currently unknown to us. The parts set in the past are often dry and hard to follow. The breaks in stories between the beginning and end are hard to follow. I finally started to get into the book about 70% of the way through. The only thing that kept me hanging on was the question, \\"What's all the fuss about? Surely this is going to get better.\\" It gets better toward the end, but this one definitely didn't hook me soon enough. I'm not sure why it's a best seller...

0452295548|4.0|\\"My Stroke of Insight\\" offers a detailed first hand account of a stroke through the lens of a neuroscientist. Dr. Jill Bolte Taylor provides a fascinating perspective as she provides details of the experience, and relates these stroke symptoms to the brain issues that were causing them.  I was eager to read the book after watching Dr. Taylors T.E.D presentation on her experience, and am glad I took the time to read the account in its entirety.<br /><br />Synopsis:<br /> This book starts off with a brief introduction of her life, research, and reason for becoming a neuroscientist.  Dr. Taylor then provides a couple of chapters dedicated to educating readers in basic brain function and anatomy. In this section she does a great job detailing the differences of our two cerebral hemispheres.  This information regarding the function of each hemisphere is useful in her later account of the stroke<br /> After providing this background information, she describes waking up with an excruciating headache. At first, Dr. Taylor attempts to get rid of these pains by normal means, but she is astonished by the extremely unusual perception of reality that she is experiencing. She states, that she feels like her senses have no filter, that all sounds and lights are excruciatingly powerful and painful. She loses the ability to think sequentially and realizes she can hardly speak. Most notably, she cannot maintain focus on any one task, which makes organizing her rescue significantly more difficult.<br />  Throughout this entire ordeal, she repeatedly describes this raw perception as blissful with intermittent moments of complete euphoria. None of the typical \\"brain chatter\\" is cluttering up her senses. She feels as one with her body, fully aware of each communication in her body, even including the transmissions to muscles in her legs instructing them to contract to maintain balance.  She describes the stroke as \\"the first time I felt truly at one with my body as a complex constructionof living, thriving organisms\\"<br />After struggling to get help, Dr. Taylor describes the trials of a confused stroke patient rapidly being screened and questioned by multiple scurrying healthcare professionals. She then depicts the journey through the initial treatment process through the lens of a disconnected patient. Repeatedly she mentions having to make the difficult decision to attempt recovery, and how exhausting the road to recovery was for her.<br /><br />My Opinion:<br />The combination of the unique experience and education Dr. Taylor was \\"blessed\\" with put her in a position to hit a homerun with a book detailing this account, and she hit a triple.  For a book that is as educational as it is, she does a stunning job of maintaining the audience's attention by appealing to emotions and senses.<br />  The way in which Dr. Taylor goes about teaching anatomy in the first few chapters is interesting and surprisingly robust. She was savvy enough to provide all the necessary physiology training in the first few chapters, and when things need further explanations she provided intuitive diagrams.<br />  The description of the stroke itself was the most stirring section of the book, and understandably so. Dr. Taylor is able to present in unbelievable detail the perception of someone losing contact with his or her left hemisphere. The internal imagery she delivers here makes readers attempt to imagine the sensation she felt when she was experiencing complete \\"brain chatter silence\\" and fully aware of each of her incoming senses.<br />  The account of her recovery from the emergency room, to being independent with activities of daily living, and being able to write a book, are significantly slower than the earlier parts of the book, but she does tell a motivational story. She makes clear the difficulties and frustrations faced by a patient recovering from neurological damage.<br />  One question repeatedly found its way to my consciousness while reading this book:If the stroke was really causing all these problems, how was she able to harness the cognitive ability to recognize the physiology of the situation? During the early stages of the stroke she says, \\"I understood neuroanatomically that my motor cortex had been affected...\\" How was she able to connect her symptoms with the portion of the brain most likely affected? It doesn't seem likely that she could make this connection while she \\"felt devoid of my worldly wisdom and I was desperate to maintain a cognitive link between my moments.\\"  Her cognitive ability to recognize the problem seems to contradict the neurological deficits she is describing. This contradiction makes me believe that parts of the account were embellished with facts that were probably only obtained after the fact.<br /><br />For Neuroscience Novices:<br />  This book is written for you. Any physiological information you need to comprehend and appreciate this book is included.  Dr. Taylor goes out of her way to use non-medical language and helpful analogies when describing the more complex aspects of her experience. Especially for people who may have a loved one that has had a stroke, this could be a very eye-opening reading into what he or she may have endured.  This also provides a motivational story of recovery from a near death situation. Dr. Taylor describes how she was able to harness her motivation to energize her through the tiring recovery process. Dr. Taylor also includes a recipe for building an encouraging environment for recovering stroke patients, which could prove invaluable to the families of stroke victims.<br /><br />For Medical Providers:<br />  This would be an excellent read for all medical providers, particularly those that work with patients suffering from neurological deficits. The book provides basic background information that may or may not seem redundant, and if you would rather avoid this you can easily just skip chapters 2 and 3. However, she does provide an intriguing discussion of the brains hemispheres presented in a manner you probably have not heard before.<br />  Most relevant however is the discussion about how she felt to be a patient in our healthcare system.  She described how chaotic and disturbing the treatment environment felt to a patient that had just experienced a stroke. She speaks about an interaction with a medical student that was more concerned with completing task than caring for the patients, and how discouraging the hospital environment can be. As a medical provider, it is understandably difficult to be concerned with the emotional wellbeing of a patient when the patient's life is in danger, however Dr. Taylor makes a convincing argument for the importance of this aspect of healthcare.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />  Overall, this is an amazing story, which I would recommend for all readers. The latter part of the book may seem to develop slowly, but it is a truly amazing story. This motivational book follows the journey of high functioning PhD that is suddenly disabled by a stroke that leaves her unable to speak or read, but manages to recover fully.
B0087HT36U|4.0|Good game to play when bored a lot like angry birds.can't play fourth level until I write this review I hope
B009AJDDQU|4.0|The movie was not quite what I expected and the relation to Alien is not as clear as one would expect. In fact, its a bit of a puzzle how the two movies could connect without having the obvious contradiction that this movie would have happened BEFORE Alien and nevertheless they have far more advanced technology here. That said, the movie is good and provides an interesting background and explanation for some of the things you see in Alien. The story is a bit weak towards the end and not some scenes do not make a lot of sense. However, the special features (Deleted scenes, alternate scenes - if your edition offers them) definitely add to the story. I think they should have been included in the movie and it would have made it much clearer. But maybe the decision was to keep the movie a bit shorter and more fast paced, I would have enjoyed a slower, more detailed movie more. Also the director's commentary is worth to listen in, it gives more details on the ideas behind scenes and helps to understand the movie. As a fan of Alien 1-3 (I don't like Alien 4 and I didn't even try the Alien vs. Predator stuff) I think this is a great movie and makes a nice addition to the set. If you have never seen Alien and are not into SciFi movies, keep your hands off.
B008673ZAQ|3.0|*3.5 Stars*<br /><br />Reflected in You was an emotionally exhausting roller coaster ride. A good sequel to Bared to You, but not really a strong one in my opinion. Some parts dragged a bit and the fighting & jealousy got a bit worn out for me. Some parts seemed almost repetitive. In addition, there didn't seem to be much story for the first 2/3 of the book. I felt that the story was just spotlighting Eva around & there weren't much scenes of Eva & Gideon actually together as a couple as Gideon's presence was not much in the book (which was obviously explained later). However, I liked the twist at the end which was quite a surprise. That was probably the only time that really got my attention. Nonetheless, Reflected in You was still enjoyable and am looking forward to Entwined With You to see where Gideon and Eva's story will lead to with especially with that shocker ending.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|Overall Fifty Shades Freed was predicable just like the first two books in the trilogy. I was not impressed because I read so many books like this in the past.

B0098VYCCE|1.0|I have Netflix and Hulu Plus. I never have any problems streaming movies from other venders. But Amazon stops every two minutes to catch up with its buffer. So if you want to watch a circle go round and round for two hours the go ahead and stream this. I will never rent another movie from Amazon.

B007ZZ3RI0|4.0|Whereas For Your Entertainment was more mainstream pop, Trespassing features more dance, more funk, more edge. Songs like \\"Never Close Our Eyes\\" and \\"Naked Love\\" are catchy pop, and \\"Shady\\" is a true dance song. Adam Lambert expresses himself beautifully in songs like \\"Underneath\\" and \\"Outlaws of Love\\". It's a great album from a great singer.
B002TZ3DYY|4.0|The first book in the No 1 Ladies Detective Agencey series captured me completely and so did this one. It is so unlike other crime novels I have read.  I enjoyed learning about people in Botswana and how they live their lives.  It is quite a gentle read and amusing.  Alexander McCall Smith has depicted the characters well.  I know I shall go on reading the rest of the series as I enjoyed it so much
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|Excellent story line and graphics. Hidden object scenes will enlarge which is key on a Kindle. Puzzles are. well placed and challenging.
0345803485|1.0|I'm with the folks who find the dialogue laughable, character development nonexistent, and writing style awkward and repetitive.  If you're looking for kinky sex, you will be disappointed, as Chris gives up on his quest for domination of the reluctant Ana in the first book and after that they are just two fairly inarticulate young people who like to jump each other frequently. I can't understand where all the hype came from.  In fact, the first book was so pathetic I read the second to make absolutely I wasn't missing something (they are so repetitive you can skim a bit).  The second one is slightly better written, in that there are somewhat fewer \\"holy cow/crap/shit\\" exclamations and no more \\"inner goddess\\" interior monologue (now referred to as \\"my subconscious\\").  A slight improvement.<br /><br />To describe E.L. James' writing skills succinctly:  it is not until page 133 of the second tome that we learn loverboy has red hair.
B007UR1OHO|2.0|I'm really perplexed why this movie is considered a romantic comedy. It is not particularly romantic or comedic. This is no \\"When Harry Met Sally\\". This movie would have been a flop if it was not for Rachel McAdams. She is a fabulous actress. Its too bad she has been typecasted for these so called romantic romcoms. Tatum Channing is woefully miscast. He is flat as a distressed husband trying to deal with his wife's disability. I think Ryan Gosling or Ryan Reynolds would have been better choices.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|My daughter and I compete who can get the highest scores for completed puzzles at each time level. Great fun.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|The story line and characters have you laughing from start to finish.  You also learn some history while you're at it.
B0055SWM08|5.0|this app has the combination of characteristics that make a blockbuster. an artistic design superior to most, a music that can be heard on infinite loop and a difficulty level that is adaptable to all levels. great job
0345803493|2.0|As others have commented, if you can get past the awful writing, it's a mildly engaging potboiler as you wait for something to finally happen.  But it's so annoying - no one ever \\"says\\" anything; they either whisper, murmur, or mutter, often several time on one page...if they make a movie true to the book it will be a very quiet one.  Though E.L. James' linguistic skills are shockingly limited, the wisp of a plot could be enough to keep you hanging on if your standards aren't too high.  Kinky sex, the supposed attraction of the book, is in regrettably short supply.  With competent editing, there could have been one good book rather than three lame ones.
B005R32L66|4.0|I have made several calls and surveyed people on the other end.  For the most part the calls sound like a regular cell phone call.  The interface is easy to learn.  The service seems priced right (I have the unlimited international plan).
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Great movie with a lot ...and I mean lot of special effects.<br /><br />The story is simple: all superheroes are reunited to save the earth from a bunch of ugly aliens. The acting is fantastic as expected and dominated by Robert Downey Jr (Iron man) who always cracks these one liners that are sometimes funny. Even Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) finds a way to control himself.<br /><br />If you can, you should definitely watch the movie in 3D. It is really well done. Especially towards the end when the war starts and you can see the planes practically flying over your head.
B008KW43TE|5.0|This is an excellent CD from top to bottom. Every song is both meaningful and powerful with great beats and a soulful Frank Ocean voice. I'm not a huge R&B guy but I've been listening to this album for weeks and can't get enough - it's that good.

B003JTHWJQ|5.0|It seems that those who dislike this book are those who feel that the subject of religion is sacrosanct. One must not criticize or speak negatively about the beliefs of others. If that's your position, if you have a problem with truth, you should avoid this book. On the other hand, if you are interested in truth and have an open mind, read it. Does the truth make you free? Yes, if you care to listen.<br /><br />Dawkins writes clearly and simply. The book is not difficult to understand. His credentials and his scholarship are beyond question and beyond reproach.<br /><br />Robert Heinlein said that one's allegiance must be to truth, and if a truer truth comes along you must hitch your wagon to that truth. I find truth in this book.
B0058YPL66|5.0|I was hooked on this show the minute it started!! I love the way the Fairy Tale characters are portrayed from the pastto the present time, all the actors and actresses are perfect in their roles. I looked forward to every episode and bought the DVd as<br />soon as I was able to. Couldn't wait for the second season to start and also wait for each new episode. Writers keep up the good work!!
B0085TKAW6|5.0|Ken Follett at his best. Part two of a great journey in human folly.The worst part is now waiting for book three.Bugger!
B006UAWH2S|3.0|Well acted film that places a heart in an end-of-days sci-fi backdrop. McGregor and Green has a lucrative chemistry compared to any Jane Austen made-for-film.
B009AJDDQU|5.0|OK for those who went into this movie thinking that maybe it will be the \\"prequel\\" to Alien. Well guess what? It is! In it's own sort of fashion. It's not a direct prequel, it just sets the stage for what will become the nightmare that Ellen Ripley must endure. She just wanted to go home to her daughter. So of course the crew of the Prometheus sets down on a moon orbiting the infamous LV-426. Looking for their creators, the crew begins to realize they made a HUGE mistake by going there. The movie itself is as beautiful as anything committed to film. Ridley Scott defined the Sci/Fi horror genre back in 1979. He brought it back in 2012. That should be enough to satisfy any fan of the evergrowing \\"Alien Legacy\\". I guess that's what you call it now. Mr. Scott just reminded us that Science Fiction can be the most engrossing,disturbing,exciting,and fascinating movies that people will ever see....2 thumbs up for Prometheus..
B0099G4Y26|5.0|Love it. It's a great album and for the price it was even better. Pink is an awesome artist.  She really knows how to put herself out there.
B000FBFML6|4.0|Robin Hobb has created characters that you'll want to continue reading about for as long as possible - the Fool is certainly one of them.  Golden Fool continues the relationship/on-going story of Fitzchivalry and the Fool and many of the other characters that we have grown to love in this and other related Hobb's series.  A fun, enjoyable read!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Loved this book it! An intense page turner that was anything but predictable!  I'm anxious to read more novels by William Landay.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Superb!  Thought I would forget details of the Fall of Giants...not a chance!  I just love history and historical non-fiction!  Spent many Saurdays in my childhood watching WWII newsreels with my Dad.  He served in the Army during WWII in the Aleutian Islands in Alaska.  And he was a \\"southern boy\\"! When is the final book of the trilogy expected?  Ken Follett...excellent!!

B008I3QZKU|5.0|I like the Killers and have enjoyed their previous albums but this surpasses all of them. This album actually sounds quite different to their other music in some ways but for me this is maybe the best album by a US band I have ever heard. That sounds like a very high praise but for me it is simply that good.
B0098VYCCE|3.0|I enjoyed this film.  I didn't get to see the ending because my amazon rental ended before I could finish it.  I think they could have gotten a better actress to play the part of Snow White, but I enjoyed what I saw.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|It was infused with romance while still having adventure and action. I can‘t wait for the next book!! So exciting

B000091EYF|5.0|This album has a few hits on it.  I liked Bon Jovi back in the day,  but i don't follow them anymore, but its nice to have on vinyl some songs that remind you of yesterday.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Easy breezy book! Finished reading it in 3 days! It was easy to order for my kindle app for iPad and I will continue using Amazon for future purchases! This is a rather racy book and I would not recommend to my mother or mother-in-law but I would recommend it to all my girlfriends!
B005SFR7YE|5.0|Bought this for my daughter who loves all the Phantom performances; this was no exception, very well done with an amazing musical score. Arrived quickly and in perfect condition.

B008XG1X18|3.0|I really love this app. I find a lot of great things on it. The only problem I have is that it wants to \\"force close\\" all the time. And other times it just won't open. This is the only app that does this on my kindle. But that is the only down fall I have found.
044024630X|4.0|Tight action murder mystery and romance. Reacher is on a run in this book, cool , tough and one step ahead of the bad guys. It was a fun read.
B0084IG7KC|3.0|Love the movie, love amazon, but the disc is a POS. Thw very first time watching it it either looses sound or skips or freezes. There are no scratches and even other blurays that we own that do have scratches play better than that.
B008RYN44U|5.0|OK folks, we're not going to get a 1995 version of what No Doubt should be today. Music has evolved as has technology and the times we are in.  I have listened to this album a few times and I have to say it's impressive. Settle down is Great as is Looking Hot, as is One More Summer, and the reggae beats of Push and Shove.  Track 10's Heaven is my personal favourite of the album and I think it would work well as a single.<br /><br />I think the track Easy is better than One More Summer given that Easy has really subtle guitar elements that work really well.  Tracks 6 - 9 are a little slower and there's nothing wrong with that. If I were to have a critique it's that I don't like tracks 9 and 11 very much but it's not to say they are not listenable and these tracks do work with the album as a whole.<br /><br />I think if people would listen to this album with an OPEN MIND, they would appreciate all the elements of this album, just listen to to how well the bass and drums are working together.<br /><br />Quite frankly, I think the band did a great job and Gwen sounds amazing and I personally think she is the best female vocalist of our generation. I would be quite disappointed if they sounded the same as they did in 1995 with this new offering. I admire bands that evovlve as musicians.<br /><br />You have to give No dobut Credit for they have been together 26 years now and that's a considerably long time given that band's today only make it as far as 1 or 2 albums before they start popping out greatest hits to fulfil contractual obligations.<br /><br />No Doubt, if you do read this review, please put Auckland, NZ a spot to tour as my wife & I would love to see you guys play live.
B003K07DUC|5.0|Awesome movie, Matt Damon at his best as usual. The scary part about this movies is that it is probably what really happened. Our government was probably at the bottom of the war as the movie stated and a lot of people died as a result of a few people's idealogy..
B005HEEFH8|5.0|The writers did a good adaptation of a classic WWII drama(Enemy Below) in space. The suspense of where to find and destroy the enemy. Patrolling the neutral zone sounds very familiar to NORAD and air space incursions of the fifties and sixties. Cold war era tensions between Russia and the US or the Federation and the Romulan empire. It seems history can repeat itself in fiction.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|This is an amazing show. It's one of the best things on TV year after year. I would recommend this to anyone who loves action. Great characters
B007FEFLTO|2.0|I really liked the first volume of this trilogy. After eagerly awaiting, for months, volume two, I regret to say that I was greatly disappointed. Weak and confusing character development, and a story that dragged until about the last quarter of the book, when it picked up speed - a bit. It seemed like Follett just rushed it through to get it on the market. I will probably not buy volume 3.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is addictive. I have never played this game before and should have read how to play but I didn't.  it is relaxing.
B004SMD4H2|4.0|I watch this show because it reminds me of xfiles although a little watered down in comparison. I just want to find out what the big secret is that allows the impossible things to happen in Haven.
B006ID01OS|5.0|This book represent the business owner fighting for there business and strongest strategist. Experience transfer to reader, have the point of business builder would have. And have a big question in this book you will see in this book, the important question made your business be strong.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Really easy to navigate. Only thing I wish you could do is if you accidenty pin something in the wrong category, that you would have an option to move to a different board and not have to repin and delete to correct your mistake.
B002QE3CTY|4.0|The premise is solid, but some of the character development is a little lacking... I found myself confusing characters as the tone of their character was so similar to others in the story.  It will be interesting to see if the characters develop more as the series goes on, or if it was a one hit wonder!
B003L77GH4|5.0|The writers of this show are amazing as this story is so multifaceted. I love the vampire brothers and root for them both to find love. This is the only booked based show that makes me want to avoid the books so it won't taint my love for this story and world. TvD is Brilliantly done and I will remain a loyal fan til the last episode.
B008Z9YLV2|2.0|Neither the story line seemed to be a mish mash of other \\"world gone wrong\\" or post \\"end of the world\\" wars and there for didn't hold your interest.  It didn't have the depth or psychological impact of something like \\"1984.\\" It seemed to use the basis of children killing children to try and draw you in and hold your attention but that was it's weakest point.  The acting was the only good part.
B008LY9AWG|2.0|Wasn't as interesting as I had hoped for from all the other's I have enjoyed!!  The short story's were not<br />As exciting.  As I got into the story it ended.
B007GCY8FS|2.0|Lee Childs, A Wanted Man,  was good but not as great as his others.  The story was longer  and more complex than<br />It needed to be.  Some of the characters did not seem real.<br />Nonetheless, I will continue to read his books.
0446547573|2.0|Maybe I'm just over the whole Nicholas Sparks formula, but I thought this one was just ok.  It took forever to really get into the characters and then when I was just starting to like them the book was over.  I was left wondering why I read the book when I could have simply turned on Lifetime...
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I absolutely loved this book. The plot is amazing. Every event throughout this book all comes together in the end and makes so much sense. This is a must read! I love it, love it. I gave it a four because some parts of the book became boring, but still a good book.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Used to play this for hours in Vegas...Now I can waste all that time in the comfort of my own home...LOL
B00571F26Y|5.0|This book is very similar to the Paleo Solution by Robb Wolf but instead it allows milk and the author goes into more detail about wheat.<br /><br />I really liked the style of the writing and it much easier to digest than Robb wolfs book but I would still recommended them both but this is very easy to understand.  Either way they both recommended you remove grains and give good reason
B008BO61BE|1.0|The DVD would not play in my laptop or any DVD player in my house. Looks like the disc was never finalized.
B0010T3UUC|5.0|I ordered the crocs and received them on time. I ordered the wrong size and returned the shoes. They sent me the correct size in record time. I got them back in 6 days. The shoes fit very well. They keep my feet dry(I am a dog groomer).<br />They are very comfortable. I would highly recommend these shoes.
B007KQ6XYY|4.0|This in one of the only games I play regularly on my Kindle Fire.  It's fun and challenging.  Slowly I am gaining levels and I don't intend to give up.  And I love the little characters.  Evan when I fail at a puzzle, I am still laughing.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love this game it is fun to do it so I hope I can do it again on my kindle fire
B004I744AS|1.0|I love this app I am a college student and use it ALL the time. It uses the word in a sentence. The only thing I would add is an audible definition.
0525953728|5.0|It was an excellent book; I couldn't put it down.  It details the end of Bin Laden, but also the life and hardships of a Navy Seal.
B003ELY7PG|5.0|Re-work is a must read for tech startups. The concepts shared in the book have the potential to transform any startup into a force to reckon with. Saying no to features and keeping it simple has never been explained with so much simplicity.
1451662432|4.0|As someone who grew up in the 80's I was a huge fan of all of Arnold's movies. I even had his posters on my walls  and used his pics as motivation to get to the gym - so I was very excited to read this book. It was a very interesting/entertaining read that I read through within a few days, I really liked the way historical events tied into his life. Half way through the book I began to realize though that I was reading the \\"facts\\" through eyes of someone with a huge ego and may not be the entire picture of actual events. He's hardly the first autobiograher to do that. It's all very entertaining but I began to take Arnold's interpretations of events with a grain of salt. His so called warts are touched on lightly and glossed over quickly. Even his chapter on \\"The Secret\\" came across as more of a commercial for upcoming projects than any kind of soul searching Mea culpa of how he hurt his family, not even the whole chapter was dedicated to it. I would be very interested in reading a book from people close to him to see if they paint the same rosy picture of him as Arnold does - maybe they do but I would take more stock in their accounts than his. All that being said - I love the guys movies and you have to respect where he came from and where he got to. Book was very interesting and well worth the read
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I'm inclinded to think it is nothing but pornography and makes the sex act lose all meaning and beauty.  I skipped 0ver many portions of the book and, honestly, wish I hadn't purchased it.  With all the hype I decided to read it, but it just isn't<br />the type of book I would ever purchase again.  Some sex in a book can be tittilating, but unless you're interested in S & M, etc., this is not the book for you.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I like this game. I just wish it was easier to get more acorns. Collecting more hearts is just as fun.
B000ICZD5M|4.0|Classic story driven Sci-Fi movie.The original is much better than the remake in my opinion. One of the few Sci-Fi movies that is more about the story than the special effects, though the effects are not bad. The Blu-Ray is very good quality and gives a leg up on the quality of the effects.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Really enjoyed this series. It was a little slow for the first few chapter but then I couldn't put it down.
B006WQLH7G|2.0|I started using AVAST because seekdroid needs a google account to use.  I am very disappointed that this program now also requires a google account.  I use Amazon App store so I DON'T HAVE TO USE GOOGLE!!! Ticks me off that all these anti-theft programs require a google account!
B005LAII9Y|3.0|I actually kind of like horror comedy films more than the usual just plain comedy films intended for children, as such films usually only follow certain cliches and predictable plots, and usually use formulas that have already been used thousands of times before that always work out in the end. Albeit Tim Burton's horror comedies usually end happily, because of the horror element involved things may not necessarily follow the same cliches that are usually found in such movies. There may be surprise twist endings or some characters may not make it to the end of the film alive. For a number of films, you usually can guess that everything is going to end perfectly well for our heroes, and that all wishes, dreams, or goals will be fulfilled.<br /><br />This is an eccentric film; I only saw it just today and basically liked it. True, it is not in color, as we usually like to see in movies, so I would have found more charm in it had it been in color. (I understand that it's the point-- to make it appear older, like classic monster movies) There are quirky, funny jokes and gags (as well as a Jim Carrey reference that many adults in the audience found entertaining) and numerous scenes were highly amusing. You definitely should go and see this comedic little film-- I am certain you will enjoy it.
B0074YVW1G|5.0|I loved this book... I felt like I was understanding myself better as I went. I so want others to read it too to 'get' me better!  As a parent of an introverted child I found it to be the best parenting book I've read. Thank you and read away :-)
B006OAB3ME|5.0|We saw Paul on PBS.  Loved the show and bought the album.  Paul is great, and so are all the stars that worked with him to make this great album.  Nice collection of unexpected tunes!
B0083Z614S|2.0|It was different not one of the most interesting reads. I really don't care to read where children are mistreated
B0058YPGSY|5.0|This has got to be one of the best shows on TV for a very long time.  I have watched 1-3, bought 4 wating for 5 to come out. The show just keeps getting better and better.
B008JMKN4Y|2.0|I read a book by Tammara Webber (great read) and this book was recommended based on that selection. I went into it thinking it would be a nice story about two young adults (much like Easy), however I was completely disappointed.<br /><br />I am an avid book reader and I am constantly looking for a good book. I often use the reviews on Amazon to help me select books. This is one book I regret purchasing and I regret allowing the completely false positive reviews to convince me to read this book. To anyone thinking about purchasing this book, PLEASE read this review. I do not want to give away too much of the plot out of respect, but I can say the plot is disjointed and awkward.<br /><br />The book begin as a story about two college students who become friends and it quickly becomes clear to everyone but the heroine in this book that the two characters are in love with each other. The first half of the book become tedious because what is so obvious to the reader and all the other characters in the book seem to escape the two lead characters (mostly Abby) and as readers we are forced to endure the constant discussion and arguing between the two about \\"what they are going to do with their relationship\\". It is become unrealistic. It is very reminiscent to Bella (in Twilight) trying to decide whether she will be with Edward and leading Jacob along for too long. When Abby and Travis do finally decide to be together, the author the decides that she needs to introduce Abby's father and suddenly the two love-birds are thrown into Las Vegas and a seen underworld. Then after that the are back on campus as if nothing has happened and we the reader never hear about Vegas and the repercussions again. And then there is a fire and people die. Yes, this plot is as silly as it sounds.<br /><br />To top all of that off, the book is rife with violence. Travis is extremely violent and never gets in trouble for this violence. He fights in public places and on the campus and is never arrested or found to be on academic probation or anything. It is so unrealistic. Finally, the two man characters are extremely co-dependent and needy. That is never addressed in the book. It is less romantic and bit insane.<br /><br />I would not recommend this book for anyone to read.
B00005MP58|5.0|This is the second version of this movie I have.  Loved the book, love the movies.  Colin Firth is good in the role.  I love period england movies. This was my cup of tea!
0060555661|5.0|Buy this book if you are interested in learning more about the stock market and how wall street is screwing the American economy :)
B009157BWU|5.0|I enjoyed Nature at work.  How animals interact with each other, as do we.  Would like to see more movies like this.
B007TNS6JI|1.0|yet another game in which you must pay real money to use most of the features. could've been good if it just charged a flat fee or made its money from ads. instead you must pay money for gems and gold in one of the most confusing and annoying systems ive seen. there was some fun to be had here, but they killed it.
B000OVLBFS|5.0|We love the jesse stone movies, can hardly wait for the next one to come out.  We like Top Selleck in this role.
B006VKKAWQ|5.0|According of the notes included, this is an authorized collection of all RCA recordings approved by the Maestro. According again<br />Of the information included, Toscanini never approved his 1920/21 recordings made in Camden New Jersey with the La Scala<br />Orchestra. I include here the Maestro Toscanini reaction about the results of his 1920/21 recordings.\\" Toscanini annoyance found<br />Expression in outbursts of violent anger ' NO, no,he said, not like this, it's no good ! All our work destroyed and useless tempi<br />Changed, wrong sonorities no dynamics, no shadings- a real pile of rubbish!\\" .After this disastrous trial the Maestro swore not to<br />To make another record ! Since the authorities of this Arturo Toscanini Collection decides to include this 1920/21 recordings<br />Against the obvious disapproval by the Maestro ,why they don't include other recordings made by Toscanini apparently not<br />Approved by the Maestro, like Borodin Symphony NO. 2 in B minor , Kalinninkov  symphony No. 1 in G minor, Tchaikovsky's<br />Tempest Overture in F minor, OP.18, Ballade Symphonique Op. 78 Richard Strauss Ein Heldenleben and recordings of other<br />Composers. Reviewing Toscanini's complete recordings ,would require a book to cover everything .All I can say that his<br />Recordings of Beethoven,Brahms, Verdi and Wagner and many other composers are great monuments of Arts and most of them<br />Belongs to the of  Great Recordings of the Century.In many of his works he is unsurpassed as a musician and as an interpreter.His<br />Honesty of the printed score and hard work to achieve perfection, as his biographer Harvey Sachs wrote: 'The most amazing thing<br />About Toscanini however, was that his straggle to achieve a beautiful performance was absolutely a matter of life and death- the<br />Struggle itself even more than the achievement. His objective in driving himself and every one else so ferociously was certainly not<br />To please an audience,made up largely ofcasuel listeners. The beauty simply had to be re-created, and to him the world was no good without it. In conclusion we have to remember that Toscanini's recording output began in 1920/21 and ended in the spring of<br />1954. Unfortunately majority of his recordings were first issued on 78 RPM and from the early fifties on LP's. They are all mono<br />Recordings and despite the heroics of the recording engineers , the sound no matter how much improved is dated,and can not be<br />Compared to the present day standards. Despite of all the obstacles the Toscanini interpretaion comes thru and is very enjoyable,<br />Particularly after second and third listening.This great collection,because of the extremely low price, can and should be recommended for every body,because of the great value of it's contents.<br /><br />To please an audience made up largely of casual listeners.

B0058PJ6NE|1.0|Doesn't work. They will STEAL your money....... I cannot download anything. What are we paying for?? Do you plan to compensate for this??
B0090P98Z4|1.0|why do all these companies use &quot;free to play&quot; in their games? although this isn't the worst example (see dungeon hunter3) its really annoying. why not just charge a flat fee of 7-10 bucks? they give an option of 9.99 a month to get many of the features, which is insane! I just don't get it. id gladly pay a flat fee for a decent game, instead of all this glu-coin nonsense....
B0009FU0ZQ|5.0|We really enjoy the Jesse Stone Series of movies.  We always look forward to the next to come out.  I hope they keep making more of these.  Nothing as good as a good mystery. Tom Selleck is great in the role!
B008AS5UAO|5.0|This is a fantastic recording!<br />The conductor is beyond any praise - fresh, dynamic, lyrical, innovative. All at once.<br />The cast is absolutely first class. D'Arcangelo, 43, is a dark, heavy-handed Don Giovanni. His immediate competitor is Ildar Abdrazakov, 36, a sarcastic and fluid hero. My only problem with this set is a convolutedly written booklet. It keeps on  referring to certain old times which had long gone (studio opera recordings, I guess) and certain new times, which have arrived (live recordings with patch sessions, probably), but never really explains why we should be sorry about the old times and what's wrong with the new times.
B005UMWFIS|5.0|I've read Stephen King books for the last 20 years. I have seen his style evolve over that time and in some cases, I've enjoyed his non-horror books more. It seems to me that King's real ability to scare lies in the evils of humanity but he also does a great job of finding hope among us too. In 11.22.63, King conjures likable characters, the mystical elements of time travel and the wonder of discovering the past. His title character is a vague version of the author himself, yearning for the days when life was simpler but not forgetting why we had to progress. The author also does a great job of maintaining the reader's curiosity and sense of adventure.<br /><br />Would you go back in time and stop something if you could? What would be the negative consequences of that act? Would you stop a terrorist attack if you knew that some of the people who died were pedophiles or killers? If you knew that half of the victims would die of cancer, slowly and painfully one day?<br /><br />Time travel has always fascinated many and the way King makes that a part of his story, rather than all of the story, is a skill not many have.<br /><br />I recommend this book to anyone interested in good story telling, time travel and the Kennedy assassination. Though King fans will be delighted as he references past works and locations, you need not be a fan to enjoy this title.
B001S86J0I|5.0|I have always loved this movie.....hilarious and feel good with great actors.  I grew up loving Star Trek and this was a fun parody.  Totally recommend seeing it and totally recommend getting it from Amazon as it was the best price.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|strangely addicting! an the more prizes u collect the better the game gets! I'm afraid it will lose my interest once i collect all the puzzle pieces tho!
014241011X|5.0|I noticed that a few people gave this book one-star reviews and ranted about how it's 'teaching children to hate real-life Witches' and similar sentiments. As a fellow Pagan, I have this to say: it is NOT TRYING TO TEACH CHILDREN (OR ANYONE FOR THAT MATTER) TO DESPISE PAGANS!!!!! I first read this book in second grade, and absolutely loved it. The thing you offended Pagans are missing is this; that right-minded people- of whom there are many- make a DISTINCTION between 'Wicked Witch of the West' witches in the media and real Wiccans. They can realize that Witches are actual human beings!
B008XG1X18|1.0|I love Pinterest but this app is so frustrating. It freezes, closes unexpectedly, won't open - makes using my Pinterest account a pain. Why can't this be fixed?<br /><br />[[ASIN:B008XG1X18 Pinterest]]<br /><br />7/23/2013<br />I was asked to rate this app when I opened it today. I clicked the rate app button included and it led to a page without a way to rate it. Typical of this app. It freezes, closes without notice, lots of \\"oops\\" screens, etc. I love Pinterest, but this app is so buggy it makes the experience miserable.<br /><br />Most of the mega-star likes are for Pinterest itself not specifically the app. That is why it gets such a good rating. The poor ratings, like mine, address the buggy app with the same comment as mine: love Pinterest, hate the app.<br /><br />Something needs to be done about all the glitches!!
B005DD7TI0|5.0|I enjoyed this movie quite a bit. I saw it when it came out, and recently rented it again. Without giving anything away, I always wondered about what happened to the people that first developed the drug.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great game. Lots of options and very addictive . I have found myself on this app more than any other...it is so easy to just pick up play a game and go on. Thanks for a trouble free app
B00785P2QC|5.0|I love this game so far.  It is much more creative than the original game giving you room to mess around.  Can't wait to see what G5 does with this series in the future.
B008XG1X18|5.0|it is a convenient and easy way to do pinterest! I love using it to find new recipes and crafts.
B005HSL626|5.0|This is a highly addictive game where you are a ninja that hates fruit and the screen is your cutting board. 3 unique game modes and customizable \\"swords\\" are just only a few of the features. You'd have to have been living under a rock to have not hear anything about this!
B00913DPW2|4.0|This game started out really slow and I probably wouldn't have continued playing it if I hadn't heard that it turns out to be a really good game.  The plot did seem to improve as it went along although the ending is somewhat anti-climactic.  Some of the mini games were very difficult and I had to skip Them or get help But for the most part were well written.  The game has a pretty large map and a lot of intricacies that were neat to figure out along the way.  Great value for the money
B007IXWKUK|4.0|But it does keep you reading and interested. I'm bummed, only one more book. Then what? i hate this part.
B003O86FMW|3.0|I didn't feel this was as developed as Hunger Games and it lacked substance.<br />In a way it seemed like a \\"filler\\" book.
B005COO1X6|4.0|I really was captivated with this story. This is Stephen King at his best. The way he used to capture your attention and not let go. I'm not into his \\"Tower\\" series because of all the tediousness of it. This story is what I enjoy. As soon as the boys older brother, who's supposed to watch him and won't let him go with him and his friends and then tells the younger brother to not get lost, you KNOW he won't listen, and his exploration to the Rest Area ... well, it was as though I was in a theater, watching a horror movie with my hands over my eyes, looking through my fingers just waiting for something to pounce. I was hooked and I HAD to keep reading. No extra, overblown scene discriptions, just enough so you could visualize. The only thing I didn't like, was the ending. Left me wanting more...
B008XG1X18|4.0|I love this app.  I can finally get on Pinterest on my Kindle.  Only issue is sometimes I can't open it on the first try and sometimes it closes.  But these are minor inconveniences to me to have this app.  I'm addicted to Pinterest and would recommend it to everyone.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Good way to pass the time, clever and entertaining. Will play again and again,can't wait to see the higher prizes
B004IYWN7C|5.0|I watched this movie with my children when they were small, and now my grandchildren.  I love it!  And, so do the kids!
B0098VXBIA|5.0|Loved this movie! They didn't try to sugarcoat pregnancy and that was refreshing. The all star cast did a great job with their characters, but I found it ironic that 3 of the 4 women playing pregnant have never been... I definitely recommend this movie for a good laugh and an honest look at being pregnant.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|My fiance and I are both addicted now! You win prizes and everything just like the arcade version. You won't regret it! I have the Samsung Galaxy S3 and also the Galaxy S 4G and it worked great on both.
B009I0QTF8|5.0|I thought Cosmogramma and the LA remix EP's were great but now Until The Quiet Comes is my favorite Fly Lotus album and favorite album of 2012.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I love hidden object games and this game is one of the best games ive played the graphics are wonderful and its very challenging
B009KHCT94|2.0|I saw the trailer for this a few months ago, and was excited to see it available on Amazon Instant Video.  All of the scenes on the moon, the space battles, and the invasion in NY are well done.  Costuming is good and decent acting.<br /><br />It all falls apart though with several interludes where they focus on a campaign manager and the President of the US.  The scenes are poorly written, poorly acted, and do little to move the story forward.  I really wish this would have just been a straight-forward Moon-Nazis-Invasion movie.
B006P4HFH6|5.0|I started watching with the pilot...that got me hooked.I wanted to watch the next episode. It's a ghost story & murder plots which is what I like. I was elated when Amazon announced the DVD was coming out. I pre-ordered it was shipped to me and cost less that expected! This has a good story line, watch it for the fun of it!
0307279189|5.0|I thought it was a joke at first.  The story of runners who ran fifty, sixty mile and more at a time and many of them bare footed.<br /><br />Caballo Blanco, was a good person and crazy runner.  I think this was such an inspiration for runners and athletes.  The author did a great job telling the story, without over embelishing the tale.<br /><br />I think it a fun story about extraordinary people.

B007GCY8FS|4.0|This was a good read for Reacher fans.  I, personally, like the books but some of them are beginning to be the same old thing, different theme.  As for Tom Cruise playing Reacher, what a stretch of the imagine that is.

If contributing to the suffering of billions of animals that live miserable lives and (quite often) die in horrific ways isn't motivating, what would be?\\" [pg. 243]<br /><br />Foer, through a masterful narrative of telling his and others' stories, makes the case that, given the state of the ways in which we produce and consume meat products, vegetarianism is the only reasonable conclusion one could come to. Let me be clear: this isn't some rant from an angry, stereotypical PETA supporter, but an author who asked questions and investigated these matters for himself.<br /><br />By using stories to make his case, he humanizes the issue. From his personal story of his Grandmother, to people who have worked at factory farms, to members of PETA, Foer asks the reader to seriously ponder the question above: Just how destructive does a culinary preference have to be before we decide to eat something else?<br /><br />Facts and stunning statistics are hard to ignore and Foer knows this. He makes clear at the beginning of the book to say that what he says has been backed up by the facts (an extensive bibliography at the end also makes this clear), so if you have any issues with his conclusions, you have to deal with evidence.<br /><br />As a vegetarian for almost 4 years now, I didn't need to be convinced that willingly eating meat makes one culpable for the millions of animals that suffer and die because we happen to enjoy the taste of their flesh, but I still gained insight into the issue and as I said above, Foer uses stories from many people to show why meat should be off our plates.<br /><br />This book is for those who have already given up eating meat or for those generally interested in the issue. Since food is such a central component of our lives, it's hard not to engage with the issue of consuming meat.<br /><br />Foer hasdone everyone a service by writing this book. Even if Foer doesn't convince you to give up eating meat, he will at least chip away at your reasoning and make you think about the issue.<br /><br />I also recommend [[ASIN:0061711306 Animal Liberation: The Definitive Classic of the Animal Movement (P.S.)]]

B0094U0RJQ|1.0|After enjoying and playing the heck out of every one of Bob's releases since 2000 (less so for \\"Together through Life\\"). I have to think that Bob is on a major downhill side musically. This release is all about dead people, or violent and then dead people. The last 4 tracks are mind numbingly repetitive musically, and depressing lyrically. What happened to love? longing? personal adventures thru life? the insights into aging? words that are crafted to penetrate the heart?<br />After playing this 4 or 5 times, suffering more with each listen instead of gaining deeper appreciation, I have 'shelved' it forever as a total failure for me.
B008M34CSI|3.0|I am always a fan of sci-fi, thus streamed this film for cheap.  It was made by a Euro-director (Luc Besson) who has done films like Precinct 13? and other wild urban action films.  This time he goes to space and Guy Pearce is the space cowboy.  His lines are worn and his character is goofy, to say the least.  The action moves okay and the special effects are decent, but it does not add up in the long run.  Thta old one with Sean Connery up in space prison had more tension and reality.  Blastoff!
B005S9EJ14|4.0|In \\"The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel,\\" seven British retirees fall for an Internet come-on that advertises a reasonably priced, grand and peaceful retreat in Jaipur, India.  After an exhausting trip, the travelers finally reach their destination, only to learn that the retreat is far from grand and not particularly peaceful.  The hotel is rather decrepit, and the surrounding area is teeming with bicyclists, motorcyclists, pedestrians, beggars, children at play, and sidewalk vendors loudly hawking their wares.<br /><br />John Madden directs with a sure touch, eliciting superb performances from his stellar cast.  Judi Dench is the recently widowed Evelyn; she is eager to manage on her own after decades of relying on her husband.  Tom Wilkinson is Graham, a high court judge with a secret that has weighed on his mind for years.  Maggie Smith, the never married Muriel, is in India to have inexpensive hip replacement surgery; she is an unabashed racist who makes no secret of her bigotry.  Bill Nighy and Penelope Wilton are Douglas and Jean, an unhappily married couple who stay together more out of habit than desire.  Celia Imrie is Madge, a lonely woman who craves male companionship, and Ronald Pickup is Norman, who is desperate to snuggle up to an attractive female.  The guests are greeted at the Marigold Hotel by its irrationally exuberant manager, Sonny, played to the hilt by Dev Patel of \\"Slumdog Millionaire\\" fame.  Sonny is trying to obtain funding so that he can transform the hotel into the beautiful retirement facility that currently exists only in his imagination.  Unfortunately, his overbearing mother is determined to take him back to New Delhi and away from his sexy girlfriend, Sunaina.<br /><br />The screenplay by Ol Parker is uneven; there are melodramatic and far-fetched elements throughout the film that require a sizeable suspension of disbelief.  Nevertheless, \\"The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel\\" is terrific entertainment, with its colorful palette that shows off India's energy and spirit.  There are quite a few deliciously humorous scenes.  For instance, Judi Dench educates young Indian call-center workers on how to handle overseas calls with tact, grace, and humanity, instead of speaking robotically from a script.  Other funny bits include Norman trying to convince a young woman that he would be a good catch and Sonny's mother loudly browbeating her son in public.  The film is poignant in its depiction of the humiliation and physical deterioration that can make old age so daunting.  Muriel reveals her somewhat gloomy history to a woman who speaks only Hindi; Madge gloomily contemplates her solitary future; and Douglas and Jean finally acknowledge that they have grown apart.  The feel-good conclusion is contrived, but the acting is so wonderful that audiences will be thrilled to watch a movie about real people, instead of superheroes, trying to cope with life's disappointments and daring to embrace its undreamed of possibilities.India's energy and spirit.

0811874192|5.0|This is one of the most beautiful pop-up books I own (I've collected quite a few over the years).  The flower displays are truly works of paper-engineering art. I try to keep it displayed on my coffee table, and it ALWAYS garners rave reviews from my guests.<br /><br />This would make a lovely hostess gift, or a nice house-warming gift.

B007FEFLTO|5.0|Follett is again at his best.  He is a master at creating families and characters that all readers can relate to. His historic accuracy is beyond reproach.  The darker parts of history are related with skill and restraint, a reader does not need to be  hit of the head with graphic details.  A wonderful read, I can't wait for part III.
B008OHV5HS|4.0|For this CD, Threshold reunited with their original vocalist, Damian Wilson, who sang on the 1993 debut Wounded Land, and on the 1997 release Extinct Instinct.  Wilson's voice is somewhat different from that of the late Andrew McDermott, who was Threshold's lead singer for many years, but sufficiently similar to preserve the band's basic musical style.  More importantly, after the modern metal digression on their last album, the band returned to the progressive approach that has been the key to their success.  Threshold's trademark sound consists of dense layers of keyboard and heavy rhythm guitar, with soaring lead guitar and vocal lines.  The songs are often lengthy and feature complex ideas, but are always melodic.  The lyrics are intelligent and articulate.  There are no outstanding tracks, but everything is competently done.  This edition includes a bonus track that was omitted from the UK release, so that the complete running time is 75 minutes.
B008XG1X18|5.0|had no problems yet love it. pin all day every day happy that I can do it on my kindle fire over my home computer.
B008Y2IU12|5.0|Snow White was my biggest and most pleasant surprise of the past summer.  Charlize Thereon was terrific as the evil queen and made the movie a memorable and worthwhile viewing at the theater and a must-own addition to a video collection. I've already watched it twice on video and am happy to own it.

0375836675|4.0|Ed Kennedy is an under aged cab driver with no plans or goals in life. He spends his nights playing cards with his friends and on his days off he hangs around his old shack with his coffee loving dog named the Doorman. Ed is what we call a man with a routine. Day in and day out he drives people, plays cards, and talks to his dog. That is until he happens to stop a bank robbery. Soon after the publicity and news articles, Ed receives a playing card. An ace to be exact. With it are street names written on the back. Now Ed must help people he doesn't know in order to fulfill his destiny as a messenger!<br /><br />  I Am the Messenger was very interesting in its own way. The characters were extremely detailed and deep. All of them had more flaws then good qualities mostly because of their past. I liked how at the end you saw more and more of the characters backgrounds and soon learned to appreciate them more. They were very sarcastic and witty, which made me like stepping in the protagonists shoes.<br /><br />  This novel made me fall head over heels for it and I didn't know why. The themes and messages were very well done and the novel was created so well to deliver them. It's funny really that I didn't realize it by reading the title. Anyways I enjoyed the themes that small acts can change someone else's life. This is a quote which explains it perfectly at the end of the novel. \\"If a guy like you can stand up and do what you did, then maybe everyone can. Maybe everyone can live beyond what they're capable of.\\"<br />Doesn't that just give you the chills?<br /><br />  The only concern I had with this book is that some of the messages delivered by Ed seemed way too simple and fast. Especially the ones towards the end. It seemed as if the author wanted to finish them quickly and go on to his grand finale. Of course this was quite insignificant considering the amazingness of this novel.<br /><br />  I greatly recommend anyone to pick this book up. Regardless of your genre preference it'll blow you away!preference it'll blow you away!
B008YW5RH2|5.0|great work ... everything about this game is simply superb. the game is very very addictive.  ... ... must have for all takers.
B008XG1X18|5.0|its an awesome app! it might not work perfectly for everyone though because you still need wifi for it to load. but other than that the pictures show up great with a lot of definition and detail. I recommend it for anyone who has things they would love to share with other people!

B008GVD6D8|1.0|I dont understand what the writer was doing with this book. Eva got on my nerves. She was whimpy, whiny and weak. Her lack of strength infuriated me. The love/relationship/obsession depicted between Eva and Gideon was so unbelievable, stupid, and crazy. What kind of person thinks this is healthy or enjoyable belongs in an insane aslyum. I dont care if this is just a book. I waited on this book to be released and had to force myself to finish it. Many times i yelled out \\"God this is stupid\\". It was just sex. And not even body stirring sex. It was disturbing and unreal. I so wish i could erase this book from my memory and get a refund.  And this is from someone who read and reread the fifty shades trilogy and willing to read the THREE books for a fourth time even 6 months later.Please dont waste your money buying this.

159562015X|1.0|The book came in a timely manner.  However, the main reason why I purchased a \\"new\\" strengths finder book was to use the access code that would allow me to take the quizes online.  After flipping through every page and not finding the access code, I ended up having to repurchase the book as an electronic version just so I could get a brand new access code.  While the book itself is good, being posted and purchased under the impression that it was \\"new\\" and finding it missing one of the most important item was definitely a huge disappointment.

B0080YGZ20|5.0|I'm gonna keep this short. Vows is an amazing album start to finish. Kimbra's vocals are top notch. There's amazing hooks left and right. The album is varied but consistent. There's some great builds and surprises. Been enjoying this one a whole lot and can't recommend it enough. She's way more than an extra voice in Gotye's Somebody That I Used To Know!
B008RYN44U|2.0|This cd is a prime example of what happens when a band has to wait around for a decade for their singer to get over what is in my opinion a way overdrawn solo career. I'm not even going to get into what I consider to be the mediocrity of most of that solo output either. It sold well sure...but that doesn't make it good. Lots of great music out there that never sees the light of day and conversely lots of bad music that sells due to mainstream appeal and the name on the cd.<br /><br />To me listening to this record, I hear a cross between Gwen's solo stuff and No Doubt. This band clearly got tired of waiting around for her (as did I) and began to write on their own. That formula = the magic is gone. When I read that the band had began writing without her I knew it was over.<br /><br />Time is precious and unfortunately now we have only to wonder what these guys could have done if they would have continued on working together after Rock Steady. We will never know. The one thing I can say is that her absence clearly hurt this band and wasted a good chunk of their legacy. They lost their groove, their rhythm, their mojo, but worstly their identity. It's sad and I can only feel bad for the other band members who got to age ten years in waiting. With age comes waning creativity and fire.<br /><br />Now they have this album out that is a mixed bag. I somewhat like about half of it but I can only give it a one star rating due to my knowing that the only reason it isn't what it could have been is because of everything I have just touched upon previously.<br /><br />I gave this album six spins, one more than what I consider adequate listening time to evaluate.<br /><br />The biggest problem with this cd: It's yet another over-compressed, brickwalled, fatiguing listen.y than I prefer, but it's not a hard listen...if listening with an open mind. 3.5 stars.

I‘m so happy that I've discovered this very talented writer and his wonderful, amazing stories.

1401232590|4.0|Although it was an interesting story with some nice twists, I feel that it did not cover the friendship between Bruce Wayne/Batman and Harvey Dent. And Harvey's character is not that likeable. And the last pages were a bit strange too...<br />I did like the fact that this story has a lot of villains crammed into it and Tim Sale's art is top notch. I liked Dark Victory better.

B005K17RU0|1.0|I have accuweather plus on my Nook Tablet and it is an OK app, but when I put accuweather on my mom's Kindle Fire, there is a big annoying ad in the middle top of the screen, and it won't go away.  We PAID for this BS!  DO NOT BUY THIS APP!  The Plus version is mostly graphical fluff and light on substance, but still somewhat worth the few bucks it costs.  This version was the only one in the Kindle app store and it is not free, but there are still ads.  And they are large, in the way and persistent.  I'm so sick of incessant marketing that I'm becoming a techno-phobe. I'm going to throw away this sick piece of crap and wait for the plus version.
B007UPNA6Y|4.0|Another good read. Plausible and fast moving with Reacher  set in full character. Good plot  I enjoy the detail in setting up each scenario of the story.
B004HKZHES|4.0|If this ends up being Sonic Youth's last record, I think it's appropriate, positive note to go out on.<br /><br />The music on Simon Werner a Disparu is ranges from pastoral to somewhat menacing, but it is never intrusive. It's not particularly demanding or challenging (at least to a Sonic Youth fan), but avoids being boring and never stays in one place for very long. Imagine a quiet, uneventful rural New England car ride. You stare out the window, watching the trees and telephone wires and pine needles go by, occasionally passing through a small town and looking at old houses and small locally owned convenience stores. Nothing is exciting, but you're not bored with it all. You passively take it all in and remain content. It's almost hypnotic after a while.<br /><br />Sonic Youth has gone down this path before. The underrated Murray Street album is what comes to my mind first, especially the extended jam on \\"Karen Revisited\\". It also reminds me of The Destroyed Room odds-and-ends compilation. I'm thinking that it might be the Jim O'rourke influence, although he only appears once in this recording, playing bass on the last track. This is the first time that it has truly dominated an album's entire running time, with the songs all tied together, uninterrupted and unbroken. It's like a successful extended jam session that leaves everyone happy and tired.<br /><br />Also, keep an ear out for the lovely minimalist piano in some of the tracks, which makes some moments especially delicate and pastoral.

1423140605|5.0|Note: If you haven't read the entire Percy Jackson & the Olympians series, or the first two books in the Olympus Heroes series, do not read this book until you have done so.<br /><br />I gobbled this book up like I was starving. I loved every bit of it. Never was there a moment that I was like, ugh, if I reread this book I'm going to skim these parts until I get to the better stuff. I'm also glad the author didn't focus on reintroducing the characters or plots and got straight into it.<br /><br />This book is a must read if you enjoy Riordan's Olympian universe at all. I cannot wait for the next two books! It will be torture to wait another two years for the last two books to come out!

B0082Z447U|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book. The characters held my attention. There were parts when the story dragged but for the most part I enjoyed the plot and the story line.  I liked that this book was \\"G\\" rated book.  You know the characters love each other but lusty love scenes weren't needed for the story to have value.

0307959856|4.0|Jane Austen introduced us to Miss Elizabeth Bennett, her family, and friends. We have fallen in love with her and the story surrounding her life. P.D. James brings Elizabeth and Darcy back to us in the mystery, Death Comes to Pemberley. In this new novel with old, beloved characters, James catches us up with what has been happening in the lives of the characters. It has been six years since Elizabeth and Darcy were married. They have two sons, and they are still close friends with Bingley and Jane, and their children. We find out that Colonel Fitzwilliam has feelings for Darcy's sister, Georgiana, but he is not the only one. A new character, Henry Alveston, is introduced as a love interest of Georgiana's. Of course, it wouldn't be a tale of the Bennett's without some controversy.<br /><br />The evening before the annual ball at Pemberley, Lydia shows up hysterical that Wickham has been shot. It turns out that Wickham's friend, Captain Denny was the one who was apparently murdered. Wickham says the murder is his fault and is subsequently arrested. The novel details the events between his arrest and eventual trial. Darcy has to overcome the bad blood between himself and Wickham and help provide for Wickham while he is incarcerated. I won't spoil the ending for those of you who have yet to read the story, but it isn't overly surprising.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed this novel. I think most of my approval of the novel comes from my love of Austen's characters, not James' writing. I felt like the story could have been more suspenseful. I was happy to find out though, that James took care of preserving Austen's characters. I would recommend this to anyone, and I would caution you that while you will enjoy the book, it may not become your favorite book of all time.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Enjoyed this book for the most part. It was not one of his best books though. It dragged on in several places. Still very enjoyable overall.
B0081L37Z0|2.0|This movie wasn't as good as I thought it would be.  Wish my husband and I didn't waste our only movie night watching this.
B005USZML4|5.0|I bought this for my step son. I am a big fan of John Grisham's books.  I read it and thought it was great.
B007KOYEOC|5.0|Loved all 3 of the books, didn't know what all the hype was about at first but after reading the first one I was hooked!! Can't wait for the movie to come out, fell in love with Christian and Anastasia, I can really relate to what they have which is priceless!!
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I have never been much of a reader throughout my life.  I enjoyed the Hunger Games movie and I wanted to know more about the story, so I purchased the trilogy.  After two weeks I have read the first two books.  The pacing of the story is good and every time I stop reading, I am eager to pick the book up again and see what happens next.  Though the story is geared toward a younger audience, I feel that people of all ages will enjoy these books.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|love this. better than most free apps! addictive. Unfortunately I spend too much time on this now!  Ail look for more Kindle Fire apps from this company
B0097EWK3A|4.0|This game was entertaining for me.  I enjoy search and find games with a story.  waiting for what's next.  Worked great on Kindle Fire.
B0098VYKSA|4.0|It's a nice rental for those who have a spare $5 and want to see a movie to pass the time. Some of the actors performances are stale and there are a few plot holes. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone but if you have been wanting to see an adaptation of a fairy tale in a live action summer film then please watch this movie.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I heard so much about this book, and how good it is.  I thought it was good, but somewhat predictable.  It was a slow read for me.
B006HTUZ1C|5.0|This game is great for fast thinking, and helping students review math. This game is better than flash cards for simple math.
B00884GR0W|5.0|definitely. I played the free version until I finally got tired of not being able to save anything. it was definitely worth the 5 bucks. if you're a minecraft lover, you'll enjoy this game because you can avoids monsters easier and your character can level up.
B009329ZF2|4.0|movie is wall to wall action - a good flick. Solid acting and enough drama and suspense to keep you into the film. Good solid flick!
B009329ZF2|4.0|Battleship received a lot of bad reviews from the press and from some movie-goers. This is not meant to be an Oscar-caliber movie. It is pure fun and entertainment. I rented it looking for enjoyment from an action movie and I was not disappointed. Sure you needed to suspend some level of belief - it's about aliens invading Earth. You don't need to nitpick the details of the plot. Overall, it was a fun movie to watch.
B007IXWKUK|2.0|After all the hype about this series of books, I finally got around to reading the entire series.  I found nothing exceptional about them.  They're typical \\"romance trash\\" with some kink tossed in a few times, but nothing extraordinary.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Gone Girl is really diffrent from what I usually read.  But, it definitely had my attention from the get go.  All written from a different perspective than the usual novel.  Each chapter is as seen thru that particular character.  Very well written and a page turner.[[ASIN:030758836X Gone Girl: A Novel]]
B000SEGUDE|4.0|I picked up this book because I was intrigued by the movie previews and other stories about the movie.  I really enjoyed reading something that was complicated and well written.  I was obliged to trust the author to bring the different story lines together, as each transition was a bit jarring.  Unfortunately, the whole was less than the sum of its parts, as I didn't feel that all/most of the threads were resolved, and the \\"grand story arch\\" wasn't clear.  Yes there were themes, but the connection between the different stories were never really acknowledged.<br />I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys philosophical/existential books that are anchored by solid characters and quality writing.
B008MEM24S|5.0|My daughter loves this game. Keeps her busy for awhile. Its a thinking game. Every level is not the same. It gets harder each time.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Excellent book, that gives you a SEAL Snipers' view of both the war and himself.  Very glad I bought this one!!
B005M61PGA|3.0|I love KM's music but her last two albums have been disappointing.  Only 3 tracks on a Secret Symphony are any good.  Pictures is her best.  I won't give up hope she can repeat next time.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I have read many books about Seals and their training but it was great to read first hand account of a mission. Too bad as usual politics will get in the way of certain things. Hats off to these guys, they keep our country safe.
B000VDUWMC|5.0|Fascinating examination of the reasons that different cultures progressed from simple to complex, with a focus on why some cultures progressed so much more rapidly than others.
B00887490Y|4.0|So there's essentially nothing I can really say about the plot without giving anything away that's vital to the enjoyment of this thought provoking and fairly controversial film. I was looking at reviews and people either hated it, loved it or raged the hell out over it. Basically, you got a tiny town where kids are disappearing without any trace whatsoever and the only leads anyone has is a strange myth about \\"The Tall Man\\", a creature that lurks deep in the woods. The movie starts out incredible, hits a dry spot, gets very, very confusing to the point that you're almost done with it and then its throws everything in overdrive, answers all your questions and ends the best way it could.<br /><br />I have pretty much no reason to not give this a perfect rating except that it had a few very pointless dry and somewhat pointless parts and it was advertised as a horror when its not very scary but is defiantly a thriller.<br /><br />p.s. this is not a slenderman movie as a ton of people want to think it is. I had originally thought it was until further inspection
B009LZGY0A|3.0|Just when you think it's safe to raise your head above the Penny-Leonard Mendosa Line, Leonard turns into a girl.
B00785P2QC|4.0|This is a great game, but would be better if they gave more investment points. Over all fun way to waist a few hours.
B00005N6KG|4.0|Sony delivers again with beautiful sound! These head phones are comfortable to ware, and are well worth the price. Very pleased!
0525953728|5.0|The two day reading binge that allowed me to conquer this book is a testament to a couple things; one - it's a pretty easy read in general, and two - the content was gripping, to say the least. If you're looking for a full-on Osama slaughter you're sadism might be better off searching elsewhere. \\"Owen\\" shares his romance with the trials and tribulations of military life during his service. Can't wait to read it again once I calm down.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I love that I can get this app on my ipad, ibook and my kindle. I can access my notes from all three. You can take pictures or upload picture, use voice recording and print. You can send to facebook or email. Also I like that I can edit my writings.
B003O86FMW|3.0|This book did drag on just a little for me but set the scene for the final book loved it
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Yes, it's formulaic but it's Reacher! Come on folks, you know what to expect and I wasn't disappointed at all. A bit short on character developement but still a fun ride.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I loved the book.  But I love everything Ken Follett writes.  His description of the characters and their lives is very intriguing and he always keeps me interested.  I hate it when the book ends.
B009329ZF2|5.0|Battleship is a great movie it's the best alien invasion movie that I believe takes the gold It so real and the picture quality is tremendous
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|The game was enjoyable and kept me interested from the beginning till the end.I am looking forward to the sequel.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|So glad this author wrapped up the story and didn't leave us hanging! Kudos for a well written series. Very enjoyable.
B000FBFN1U|1.0|This is the third book in the series and I liked each one less.  Everyone that is good or tries to do the right thing or act with integrity is severely punished and then killed.  In real life the \\"good guy\\" wins<br />occasionally.  There is so much sex, humiliation and cruelty in this book it gets to be tiresome. I can not recommend this series of books.
B0063GORYU|5.0|no problems downloading.  it works great on kindle fire. i would this recommend this game to anyone who likes spider solitary.
0765365278|5.0|Great read, amazing imagination and couldn't ask for better character development.  It is long but so worth the time.  Brandon's work is consistently excellent.
B008N1LL42|5.0|Well I was wondering how you tied the old game of battleship into a movie and how they did it.. is actually VERY damn realistic and plausible.  Kudos to the writers to say the least!  Over very good visuals and honestly this movie was very good storyline wise!  I don't give away endings on reviews but I gotta say this.. GOTTA love how it plays out to say the least and kept you guessing the whole time unlike other movies which you can just see coming a mile away whats to happen next.  Overall great movie and glad I have it in my library!
B007SYWFRM|4.0|It is fun to buy the animals and try to catch scrat. Only problem is that on the other villages it sometimes freezes Then I have to reboot
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I love this book and the other 2 in the trilogy, i could hardly put it down and was sad when it ended, I will be looking forward to more from this author!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I picked this up because the movie and I was plesanlty surprised how great this book was. Anyone who has been a teenager will relate to the sense of loss, love and transition that is depicted in this book. I love the format of the book - written in letter form to an anonymous friend. It really allows the story to move along quickly while allowing the reader to get to the heart of the main character's/ narrator's thoughts. It really is a great little book.
B008KRJWEK|5.0|good game I would reccomend it for anyone. it isn't super high tech or complicated which is why it is so great.
B0046B3QTG|5.0|One of the funniest movies I've purchased in a long time! The included Minion mini movies are a must have!
B008XG1X18|5.0|Coming from a highly addicted pinner, this app does not disappoint! I can add and organize from my Kindle Fire as easily as from the laptop.
0345803485|1.0|Who orgasms at the drop of a hat the way Ana does?! Maybe I've been missing something all these years, or maybe the young men of today are just that good. But I don't think so! Here's a life spoiler to all you young women out there who believe this garbage...it just doesn't happen that way!!!<br /><br />What bothers me about this book was how unlikeable Ana and Christian are. Ana can't think for herself. Christian is nothing more than a bully. I tried and tried to find something good about the book and it finally happened at the very end.....Ana came to her senses and left the messed up Christian. But I know that won't last for long since there are two more books that follow. Two more books filled with Holy Craps, rolling eyes, and biting lips. Ugh!<br /><br />The worst thing about 50 Shades is that it teaches young women that you should be naive, anorexic, and that it's okay to be with a man who treats you like dirt just as long as he's handsome, rich, good in bed, and has great \\"just f'd hair\\". Is this what the young women of today really believe?<br /><br />How sad that E.L. James has made millions from this trash. I'm glad I borrowed the book from the library and she didn't get a penny from me.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|just like being back on the boardwalk. you can even give it a love tap to knock off those just on the edge. but this one doesn't tilt...lol...have fun dropping some tokens
B005I4JG80|4.0|This book is a mix of solid parenting advice based on the principals of french upbringing and of an autobiographical account of how these principals were applied by the author. It's not a scientific book but has a lot of references to studies and books that support what for French people is common knowledge. Highly recommended!
B008XG1X18|5.0|love it so many ideas!! I'm going to start making Christmas fun stuff, even making cookies, a lot of the ideas are things even I can do!
0553801473|2.0|The author needs to start wrapping up the myriad of characters and move it along. There were some chapters I skimmed, and then started skipping. It seems like everyone is going to be a halfcripple survivor with no food, land or end in sight. The minor characters need to die or move away, the major characters need to do something more productive. This reads more like a reality tv show than a saga. This book was more boring than it should have been.
B007B6VOG0|4.0|Moving this to the top, since it seems someone maybe didn't read to the end: Just in case people read this and don't agree, let me be clear. I LOVED The Format's album Interventions + Lullabies. I do follow Nate's work and progress, but it's sporadic since he's not a 'big' name and it's not in mainstream news. I was ecstatic when he turned up with Fun. You're welcome to disagree with me, since it would be boring if everyone thought the same way. Just don't down-vote my review because of it.<br /><br />Like some others, I've been following the lead singer since The Format (which I first encountered in 2004). I have great respect for his song writing abilities, lyrics, and also his productivity, considering he went from The Format to an all new band as Fun and has had a lot of great songs along the way. Aim and Ignite was indeed fun to listen to many, many times.<br /><br />Some Nights as an album is, as my title says, MOSTLY great. I especially love some of these tracks for driving, as singing along can make a long road trip fly by. However I also agree with many other reviews here about the auto-tune. I actually enjoy well-applied auto-tune in electronic tracks. I don't consider it very well applied on this album; the way it was just tossed into Some Nights near the end is almost irritating, though not quite enough to make me hit the button for next track. In that track, it's the lack of consistency in what is otherwise an amazing 'anthem'. Additionally when I watched the video for the first time the other day, the setting of a Civil War battle made it an even more incongruous choice. I actually really loved that video, since it told a story. I should mention that the 'intro' track is a bit goofy, but I don't hate it.<br /><br />We Are Young and Carry On are two more amazing tracks I have on my car's mix-CD.<br /><br />The 'It Gets Better' song, unfortunately, just sounds like garbage to me. There's a few engaging moments where they play with the tempo and pitch of the tune, but overall it's repetitive and sounds like they mixed it with old Casio keyboard beats. Considering how it seems to be trying to be a more electronic sound, it's surprising but the autotuning still sounds awful on it.<br /><br />Why Am I The One has lovely harmonies and is enjoyable. All Alone is pretty good, although at times it indulges an overproduced back beat. Like the AT in Some Nights though, I can tolerate it and don't skip it. All Alright suffers a touch from this as well with the same result. One Foot is also enjoyable, maybe because it sort of reminds me of 90s hip-hop (not that I'm very familiar with the genre, but that's what it makes me think of).<br /><br />Stars... is pretty much where the album loses me. I've tried to listen to it a few times. Mostly what happens is I get about halfway through it, realize I hate whatever's going on, and skip to another song or album entirely. I agree with others in their call for an acoustic or at least non-auto-tuned version. It sounds like it had a lot of potential and then some record producer got their hands on it; given that their label is Indy as far as I know, I doubt that's what actually happened, but whatever the case, I wish they'd left it to stand on the merit of lyrics, melody, instruments, and voice. I'm sure it would have done fine that way.<br /><br />I've also got a bonus track, Out On The Town, which returns to form with an enjoyable melding of the singer, a tune that just feels good, and a good mix of instruments/percussion.<br /><br />I think Nate's an amazing song writer and singer, kind of wish Sam were still playing guitar for him but the Fun members are great performers as well (as well as backup singers). I just wish this album could shine on those merits instead of throwing in cheap computerized tricks. These guys are better than that and I hope they return to skill-based music exclusively.the tune, but overall it's repetitive and sounds like they mixed it with old Casio keyboard beats.

B0098VXBIA|4.0|I bought my wife the book 7 years ago.  It was good seeing a theatrical version of the book come to life!  Chris Rock was funny!!
0545101425|5.0|I delayed getting this last CD due to the mediocre rating and realize that many did not like the ending and thus the poor feedback but that has nothing to do with the actual CD and the voice actress that did a great job in all three books in delivering a good performance to match the intensity of the book.  I for one really enjoyed the series and especially the third book and liked it from start to finish.  Kept me guessing the whole way through.  Moral of this review:  Don't let other's opinions sway your decision but rather make your own opinion on this book.  Incidentally, Amazon's price was right and equal more or less to Costco.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|I'm a big fan of the reacher series, but they just don't have the same quality they used to have, this is definitely better than the last (rated that one a two), but gone are the days of 4 and 5 reacher novels. I started reading this series a long time ago and to be truthful will keep buying them, but I think the story and character is worn out for the writer.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|it is ok u think it is a bunch of games no but it is fun. it is an ok game
B005K17RU0|5.0|Very nice app, works extreamly well. Have had no trouble with it at all.<br />Would reccoment it to everyone who would like to keep up with weather conditions.
B009ENKLFS|5.0|This episode was simply amazing! It had something for every Gleek--Blaine, Unique, Tina, Jake and Marley, as well as Rachel and Kurt! Personally, I'm a HUGE Klaine fan, so the Blaine and Artie song (Boys/Boyfriend) was hilarious! Any Gleek and Britney Spears fan will love this episode!
B00395ZYVS|4.0|I really like reading about different cultures and this book provides that. The families portrayed were likable and it was a quick read.
B0090EHVMC|5.0|This movie is obviously a message about pollution but in the forefront is a great modern day musical. The music in this movie will be stuck in your head for days. It's great for all ages. There are no memorable performances in this movie and the story is old and predictable. It's fun while it lasts and that's not a bad thing. It's no Toy Story 3. It is however, a highly quotable, highly enjoyable musical comedy.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game works so well on my Kindle Fire!  Just a fun relaxing game that will &quot;take you back to the good old days&quot;! Can't beat it for a free game!
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Slow at the start but  ready player one takes a new look at where my generation is heading and fast

B004M9ZI0M|4.0|When I read the reviews of this film, I was a little disappointed that a Shakespeare adaptation with Helen Mirren did not have better reviews. The last film made of this play was in the 1970s, and I was really happy that a new film was being released. When I watched it, mostly because I wanted to show it in a Shakespeare class I am teaching, I was surprised at the negativity I had read. While the film is not perfect, the performances are great (especially Helen Mirren, but I expected no less). The characters are very well cast, the pacing is good, and the film captures a lot of what I love about the play. There are some odd artistic choices, such as the incidental music at times, and some of the cuts made from the play to the film give a less complex view of Propera, making her more sympathetic by eliminating some of the darker qualities in the character from the play. Overall I really enjoyed the film, and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys Shakespeare or just likes watching Helen Mirren do what she does best.
B008XG1X18|4.0|pinterest is as expected and advertised.  great app for storing links to websites, etc for future reference.  I have used this app for clients building new homes to store information for each area.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|great game to play to kill time. best action game I played so far get you'll enjoy it. also great graphics and cool monsters and bosses and cool moves.. plus you don't really need to spend money to buy good armorial really cool game.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Let me start off by saying, I am not a follower per say of super heroe type movies but I am a lover of spectacular films. I would not have normally seen this movie but the reviews have been for the most part just wonderful.<br /><br />Well ,I got to see it and I must say with all the movies I have seen this year,this one has turned out to be my favorite. The special effects were something to behold, it just moved along great, and even had some humor speckeled in. There is no question in my mind ,when there is a good sale on the 3-D version I will, as they said in one commercial a while back,\\"jump in it\\" .This one is a keeper
B0083SBMBM|4.0|Let me first start out by saying Marvel's Avengers was an amazing movie, and deserves five stars, however, the DVD and its features, or rather, lack of them, makes this only four stars. I find it ridiculous that the only bonus features on the regular DVD is a commentary and one featurette, while the Blu ray has all the meat and potatoes like deleted scenes, outtakes, featurettes and extended scenes. It really isn't fair, not everyone has a blu ray player. The only reason I can think of for the DVD not to have everything, is simply for the company to make more money from the blu ray sales. I hope in the future a two disc DVD will come out (you know, like they USED to do for Iron Man and Incredible Hulk) that has the other features.
0345803485|1.0|Save your money, time, and tranquility.  Sorry, I didn't care for it at all. My fault that I didn't read any reviews to find out what it is about. Basically, an inexperienced college girl meets and falls for a rich guy whose sexual practices are barbaric.  I hope this book doesn't persuade men that this what women want...I fear it's influence. Just wanted to put this review in to warn people of what they are buying. I will not read the other books in the series by this author.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love this game and this is my 2day playing it and I have run down half of my battery
B006LSZECO|5.0|I love all of her books.  This one is by far the best, I could not put it down.  It deals with a current topic but still manages to be unique & original.  READ IT!
B004021JAY|5.0|These shoes fit well and clean nicely. They are true to size and stay on. My daughter really likes wearing them to school.  They have done well for P.E. too.
0439023513|5.0|Great book, read it in about two days.Had no problem with receiving the book. Arrived when stated it would. I have no hesitation using this site again.
B005BY3XHC|5.0|Excellent book, very insightful, makes one look at self and dig deeper in thoughts and reactions one has to self and others
B008MG1E4A|5.0|It was very interesting, full of detail, but yet easy to understand. It made one realize how dangerous these missions are and how well-planned they have to be. It also showed how adaptable the Seals are when things go wrong.
B008N5UX9M|3.0|Whats good about this that for the first 3 or 4 songs give you an impression that this cd will be different than any Maiden .Kinda grungy for Steve but good stuff. Then it goes into a Maiden groove till the last cut. Production? Bass is pretty loud (duh)its Steve Harris.I've never liked Kevin Shirley vocals on most of his cd's anyways (why do all singers on Shirley cd's sound like they're singing in phone booth?)this is no exception.Crappy production is just to make it sound current and edgy. One guitar player looks and acts like Janick (from the video)over all I do like it. Material is good enough and didn't have to enter a huge Maiden groove.C'mon Steve use a different bass , tie your hair back , do something different.There are a few different bass sounds and effects you wont hear in I.M which are cool.Funny, this makes me want to listen to \\"Psycho Motel\\" & Bruce solo stuff. Material that sounds NOTHING like Maiden.If you like this and haven't picked up a Psycho Motel cd? Get one.
B006HTUZ1C|4.0|This game is fun because it sharpens your math.  The numbers come quick and I have to stay alert to keep playing.  I really like it.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Very poorly written, so repetitive. I think the author holds the record for the number of times you can say \\"unreadable\\" or \\"er\\" in a book.
B008F5YDRI|4.0|The plot seems a bit weak. But there is enough humor mixed with the semi-realistic portrayal of public service personnel and Yemeni politics to keep you from walking away.  All in all it was a reasonably entertaining flick.  Not a nail-bitter or a rib splitter, but good for a chuckle and appreciation for the challenges of our foreign missions to the Middle East.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Waited a long time for this book to come out but it was well worth it!  Lee Child continues to capture you with his unpredictable twists and turns in his Jack Reacher books.  Jack Reacher is my favorite literary person.  Can't get enough.  If you enjoy mysteries and creative scenarios - you too will love Lee Child's Jack Reacher series.
B0087JTAKW|2.0|I have enjoyed several of Mitch Albom's books and plays, but this one disappointed. It was predictable from the beginning, and took forever to tediously arrive at the inevitable conclusion.  I stayed with it because Albom typically has a meaningful point to make, but this one was a foregone conclusion.
B000FC0SIM|4.0|I enjoyed the stories of King's early years and the insight into what it took to create such a master of the written word.  The information was helpful and well explained. I learned a lot about style and the tools that it will take to be a truely great author.  My only hope is to one day have a small taste of success using the tools that were described in Mr. King's \\"tool box\\".
B003SI05PG|5.0|This movie brings back so many memories from  the holidays, whether it be Halloween or Christmas. Not to mention the songs are stuck in your head forever.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Fast paced drawing the reader in quickly then hangs on to the end. great read and a great story! cant wait to start book 2
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Another good book by Sylvia Day! Can't wait till the next one com es out. Its  better then Fifty Shades of Gray.
B00006LLOB|5.0|Eric Clapton is MAGNIFICENT on the \\"...Sessions\\" album. He himself has publicly questioned whether he \\"should\\"/\\"has the right to\\" play the blues. I know I'm alone on this - but he shouldn't play the blues. He's proficient at it, at best.<br />  But on this album he plays brilliant ROCK N ROLL guitar to authentic blues songs, and the result is a perfect sound. He's not psychedelic, he's not \\"rock,\\" and he certainly doesn't try (and fail) to play the blues. He's feeling it on this album, and he's exquisite. You'll feel it, too. This album is loose and tight......it's just what it needs to be.<br />  I bought this LP in 1971 and went through 3 or 4 copies, I played it so much. I actually went through a second CD, I played IT so much (never thought that'd happen!).<br />  If you love rock n roll and have any affinity at all for blues, and if you want to hear an original master playing with some '60s icons, then you want this album.
0316228532|4.0|I am an avid reader, however I never make reviews of the books I read on amazon, this is the first one I am posting. I felt that I needed to do something to try and fight back against all these unwarranted 1 star reviews (which I have read through, and find their points appalling).<br /><br />The first thing is that even when people are saying that they are not comparing this novel to Harry Potter, they clearly are. Harry Potter is a fantasy series that is heavily plot driven and was originally targeted at children. The Casual Vacancy is a book based on several months in one setting focusing on the lives of a group of people. So my first piece of advice is read the blurb.  J. K. Rowling clearly defined what this book was about from the very beginning; so if you are not someone who will enjoy this genre of novel, even if you do love Rowling, don't read it. It is not comparable in anyway to Harry Potter, so why are people who obviously do not like books dealing with current issues and want to read about some hero overcoming evil bothering to read it at all.<br /><br />Secondly I have read a lot of people complaining about the characters because they are not likeable. I, however, found them very entertaining and am sad to have parted with them. They are not likeable in the sense that I approve of their actions and I think they are good people, but they are extremely vivid characters that you feel like you know and can envisage perfectly. The characters are all quite self-centred and fail to think about anything other than their own betterment. Why is everyone whining about this? Am I the only person who has had any experience with people in the real world? Many, many people are like this. Their world revolves around \\"the self\\", they are wrapped up in a tight little bubble of \\"me, me, me\\" and do not see the ways in which they could improve the lives of others. So even if they are unlikeable, their concerns and attitudes (after learning of their personal life circumstances) are actually quite realistic.<br /><br />It is through these characters and their self-centredness that Rowling explores many current issues that are very contentious and I feel like she does this very well and very realistically. Not every protagonist is made of sunshine and rainbows, and when Rowling released this book she made it clear that it was not about a hero on a mission. This book is about everyday people dealing with everyday issues and their lives in a small town. Even if the characters are not likeable they all have something that can be related too. She deals with issues like abuse, neglect, health issues, marriage and relationships, first loves, suicide, people on both ends of the socioeconomic spectrum and many others. If such topics are not ones that interest you then this book is not for you. I feel that too many people have picked this up simply because she is J. K. Rowling; so make sure that you are interested in the matters she is dealing with here before reading it. Perhaps a pen name would have invited better feedback because then people would have read this book because of the story, rather than the author.<br /><br />Despite the very different type of tale this is to Harry Potter it still carries Rowling's wonderful way with words. She describes things vividly and callously and she makes the town and the people come to life. After reading this book I feel like I know Pagford so well that I should stop by there next time I am in England, even though it is a fictional town. This is how well she describes it. She uses her usual humour to make boring situations interesting and descriptions of plain things exciting.<br /><br />I feel that J. K. Rowling should be given the full credit she deserves for writing this book. It is an individual entity and deserves to be judged as such. Readers need to stop comparing this to Harry Potter or J. K. Rowling and just take it for what it is. So please, rather than reading it because of the author and then giving poor feedback because it wasn't for you, acknowledge what this book is actually about before you pick it up.<br /><br />Personally, I found it to be a very interesting read and it has provided me with many things to think about regarding today's society in Western countries.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|this is probably one the better free ones out the.  Its probably the one I play the most.  zgraphics are to bad and there are many levels.  Worth the download.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I have read both books in this series, and now waiting anxiously for the final installment! This couple is very intense and troubled, but I found myself really wanting to see them succeed. Without giving away the story, I was so disappointed with Eva after the rock concert, omg! Gideon is starting to really open up about his past, but something tells me, we don't know the entire story just yet, which is why I can't wait for the final installment. WOW!
B008XG1X18|5.0|Completely in love with Pinterest! There are so many foods, crafts, and tools that I use from this site. The app still has some bugs,  but the site itself is excellent!
B00136JSV2|5.0|This is a must have for any collection.This comes from an unprecedented decade in history (music and otherwise).Dylan was and still is an icon of that generation.
0307887448|5.0|This story is of a gamer in his dream world, life is a game school work everywhere is based on a game, but it also say the consequences of a gamer's world it become apocalyptic where everything is no longer in reality this book brought me back my wishes of life as a game were some what fantasized life wouldn't be pretty well this is all the spoilers I will give you read to find out the true story my last thing to say is that life shouldn't reside in a game but is reality
B002OR0RP0|1.0|This video is a fraud has nothing to 3D and you can watch free netflix I want my money back
B000QCQ9O8|5.0|Couldn't put it down.  I'm a McEwan fan and have read 2 other of his works.  Can't wait to read the rest.
0345803485|1.0|Before I launch myself into the explanation behind the well-deserved 1-star review, I want to take a moment to say that I do respect the author for the not-so-simple fact of being able to push ahead and display the perseverance it takes to complete a novel. I respect her for following and accomplishing a dream of hers--something that I believe is one of the very hardest things to do in life.  Now for my review...  I have never been as compelled as I have been to leave a review for something I have read/done/made/bought until I read this book. This is actually my very first review, ever, that I have posted online for anything. Congratulations, Fifty Shades--the words you house inside yourself are so horrendous, I took it upon myself to warn as many people as I could to NOT OPEN THE COVER. Don't touch the book. Don't even look at it. Your eyes will surely melt. I've been lucky enough my sight has been spared...  In all seriousness, I actually heard about this book from ALL over. Everywhere. Work. Internet. School. Women whispering about how amazing it was down a random hallway I happened to be sitting in at that exact moment. &#34;Have you read it yet? Omg, it's soooo good!!&#34; Christian Gray. Christian Gray. Fifty Shades. Christian Gray. &#34;It's so much like Twilight...&#34;  LIES!!!!! Do not believe a word.  Now, I'm a sucker for all books supernatural. All. I'll even waste my time reading random books written by just-graduated high school teenagers who have NO IDEA that grammar, punctuation, and SPELLING are so gosh-darn important that every other sentence needs correcting. Quite irritating. But I read it anyway. Because it deals with the supernatural.  So when I heard, with conviction, that Fifty Shades was &#34;so much like Twilight&#34;, I naturally thought 'vampires', right? Eh. Didn't want to get caught up in the stream, so I waited... months... before, one day, I finally caved in. What is so good about this book? Well, under false pretenses, I thought Christian Gray was a vampire...or other supernatural something. So I bought the book. With a giftcard, thank goodness, so no harm done. Curiosity did get the best of me.  Cracked that sucker open. Began reading. Random girl no one knows meets billionaire guy that EVERYONE knows under no special circumstances. Nothing interesting there. Bummer. Shrugged it off. Then I had to raise my brow to the very rapid development of their relationship. &#34;So, I just met this guy, like 3 days ago, but I so totally wanna lose my virginity to him.&#34; Brow-raiser, right? I'm glad you agree.  Then...a helicopter ride! WEEE!!! Shrugged it off again because circling in my head was &#34;Eh. He's a vampire. He had all the time in the world to learn to be a pilot, a build-from-the-ground-up CEO billionaire, and a Mozart-imposter.&#34; So I chuckled a bit.  I read on. And I nearly lose my jaw to the floor. That's how far it fell. Bondage? Dominant? Submissive? What. The. Fu--dge... and I actually found myself becoming...irked. Because I kept thinking... how can women, who read this book, find the concept of practically being a sex slave to a man who likes to cause pain even remotely likable, let alone &#34;amazing&#34;? I didn't understand. I still don't. I would've clocked Christian Gray right in the jaw and turned heel. Wouldn't any sensible woman do so? I would like to think so. Which makes a case in point: Anastasia, the main character in the novel, is not a sensible woman. Which just kills the story. For me, at least. I need my females strong and ready to kick butt. Ninja-style.  But I grit my teeth and read on, dedicated to my still false pretense that Gray is a supernatural being and something cool is bound to happen. Crossed my fingers, trudged on and...began cocking my head to the side and scrunching my eyebrows pretty darn hard because every other page contained a sex scene. Every. Other. Page. And it slowly dawned on me... I was reading my very first pornographic novel. But notjust ANY pornographic novel. A pornographic novel that implanted the idea of bondage, dominance, and submissiveness. Now that...was actually quite disturbing. And it didn't even add to the story! Grr!  But ever true to my love of all things supernatural, I still read on, thinking...Okay, so when are they going to mention he's a vampire? Or whatever he is. The book is dangerously coming to an end and not one hint...but I was willing to forgive the interesting disturbances the book subjected my brain to if I found out what kind of being this mysterious Gray I've been hearing about was.  And I find out...that I had been duped all along. There is NOTHING supernatural about this book. Nothing. Not one iota. I was left utterly disappointed and scarred...  The summary:  Ana, the main girl, is the cliched ignorant, dependent, clumsy, weak girl who falls irrevocably in love with a very perplexing stranger in the span of a few short days. Gray's character is not the mysterious tall, dark, and handsome. Try...bipolar to the extreme? Gonna &#34;punish&#34; you because you spoke up for yourself? Not...attractive qualities. At all. Though, apparently, there a quite a few women out there who would disagree. Which is just jaw-dropping in itself.  So, this lengthy review will hopefully deter at least one person. And for those who took the time to read it.... please tell me I'm not the only woman who thinks this a plot-less, random, pornographic novel....
B002QE3CTY|5.0|well...this totally blew my mind...<br />i love the characters, the settings, the details, the plot.....everything!! :D<br />i love the Gladers' language too~ aah<br />amazing, its descriptive with out being super slow, rather purposely fast, good pace<br />I suggest this all to you humans!!!!
B007SGM084|5.0|Love this book. I am so excited to have this on .my phone. I read it every where. I believe it is better then.my phone.
B000S0DDG0|3.0|The movie was OK but basically retelling of other shows like Sparkle of which I found 2 versions. I would not watch it again. I rented it within the last week and a half, but maybe the problem is my memory because I really can't remember much about it now.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|special tower defense game. The cartoon is very cute. the special bonus mission makes the game not so difficult to play.
B000FCKGPC|3.0|Not as good as the first three. It was very rambling. Seemed like he was just trying to fill pages in many cases.
0307887448|5.0|I won't take a lot of space describing the story as others have done. Instead I will say that this is one of those rare stories tailor made for a specific audience and done so to perfection. It's almost as though the author read my mind when crafting a story I would have done myself if I had the writing skills. Not only did I grow up in the 80s relishing every reference to old Atari games and movie references, but I also enjoy today's modern MMO games like World of Warcraft and geek out to the latest technology whenever possible. Yes, I guess you could say its more likely a \\"nerd love fest\\" but that's part of its charm. It has enough action and intrigue to stack up to cyberpunk and techno thrillers and by adding the elements that appeal to today's gamers, Cline has a masterpiece on his hands. Please, please write a follow up novel.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I was slow to start reading this book but once I did, I was happily surprised. It was a fast read that was different from many of the other stories I have read about vampires and witches. This story also had daemons! The story is filled with interesting characters. I hope the second book in the series is as enjoyable.
0525953728|5.0|This is a really great story that tells the tale of a young man dreaming to become a Navy SEAL and rising to the ranks of the elite. Does not just focus on Bin Laden but does tell those events exactly as they occurred. Trully a great story and a book that was hard to put down.
B006WQLH7G|5.0|Well, it is a free app. premium cost . I used it for the trial run.<br />I will not purchase. I use free apps.<br />It works good though. it constantly runs in the back ground. and checks for virus.

B0083EW97W|5.0|Well THE man John Mayer has done it again. Wonderful job. Mature and moving. Would expect nothing less of him. Bravo.

B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game is so awesome I love it I'm already on level six and I just got the game yesturday
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|As with the other Rick Riordan books, I really enjoyed this book!! My biggest complaint is Piper constantly referring to the Cherokee Nation, more specifically the Capital of the Cherokee Nation, as being on a reservation, or \\"on the rez.\\"  Having grown up in Tahlequah, that term was never used. I feel that part of his book was VERY poorly researched and does a huge disservice to proud Cherokee everywhere.<br /><br />Other than that, I love this story. And I can't wait to read the next book! I hope for some POV from Nico and Jason!
B0098VXMNE|5.0|All I know is I will NOT MISS SEASON 3 WAR OF THE DAMNED!! Liam McIntyre, replaces Andy Whitfield as the title character Spartacus and does a amazing job. He knew he had some huge shoes to fill and he does. He play's the lead character with all of the passion his predicessor did and has those moments were you see Spartacus start to understand that this movement has become more then about his vengeance upon Glaber, Which (spoiler) he gets. They packed season two with so much story and action and ...everything! Even though it is only 10 episodes you feel fulfilled when episode 10 comes you are left only going, WHEN DOES SEASON 3 COME OUT? With really so few and far shows worth your time to watch, you wont be disappointed with Spartacus season 2.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I love the coin dozed app. it is very addicting and find myself reaching for my kindle frequently. thanks for a great game
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|love love love it! Couldn't ask for a more fun game that exercises the mind. Can't wait to level up.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Such a strong and vibrant voice. Glad I took a risk and grabbed this series as I was looking for a good sci-fi tale. Got much more than I anticipated.<br /><br />Write more, please!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|It was cool i love all his books i am the biggest fan No arguing Team leo lol and percy
0307592731|3.0|I enjoyed the story . . . indeed I did. The character/author did come across as a bit naive and dense, childish and selfish in several places, though. I know we all have our foibles and self-indulgences, but I am not sure this story graduated us from that initial stage to one of wisdom. The trip was enjoyable. I loved accompanying her along the way, from place to place, waiting for her to open her next box. But I just did not feel the revelation of maturing and lessons learned in the end. Guess I expected tears somewhere along the way as well. Almost as if the author was hesitant about letting us in. She told us of her misdeeds, but I did not feel them. Like I said in the title - a good book to read, but not great. Not one of the ones I could pack in my \\"Monster\\" backpack if I were traipsing the PCT.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|just like the games at the arcade but you don't have to waste your own money. I cant wait to unlock the next game.
B00933JL0A|3.0|I really was enjoying playing this game, but it froze up on me and won't let me play it anymore. Any suggestions?
034580404X|5.0|A very fast read, and done well, finally by the end of the second book there was a plot, and it was intriguing..but..the end of the trilogy was abrupt
B004DP9QFS|5.0|This is awesome. Uses satellites to give up to date graphics of what the weather systems are, showing cyclones, hurricanes, day/night locations, snow, etc.  Then you can view stars and constellations from any angle.  South pole is just another tap on the globe, or go to the north pole.  You can set your own location and have all the stats reported in relation to you i.e. how long before sunrise/sunset, moonrise/moonset.  You can spin the earth in any direction and see the night lights, rivers etc.  It's awesome!! The geek in me gets excited about all I can see and that it is live and accurate!  If you are interested in weather, space, stars, this app is for you.  Runs on Kindle Fire quite nicely.<br />[[ASIN:B004DP9QFS TerraTime SALE]]
B002TLSSXO|5.0|Awesome product! Large and well made. Better than expected. Excellent use. Colors are wonderful. Bought to replace melted utensils from another manufacturer. Amazon order arrived the next day, so fast. Also purchased an additional set for my daughter. She was thrilled to receive them.
B007MB5OCE|3.0|Unlike other readers, I have not been impressed with the most recent novels coming out of Scandinavia.  They always seemed too shallow without a lot of \\"color\\".  However, I was pleasantly surprised in this case.  The only real distractions were historical errors.  Truman did not know of the atomic bomb until after Roosevelt died and there were no B-52 bombers in in WWII or the Korean War for that fact. (I once had a North Korean try to convince me otherwise.)  Other than these two distractions the read was enjoyable, especially for an older reader!
0142501123|5.0|My 3 month old little girl got this book as a pre-halloween gift from her Poopsie and it's an instant classic at our house.  My daughter loves it, and my husband and I love it even more!!!  It's a sweet, friendly kind of spooky and I love the way the animals all band together to save their witch.  It's so good I cried the first time we read it...(okay EVERYTIME...I cry everytime!)  It's sure to be a favorite year after year!
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book makes shivers go down my spine every time I think about it! Don't listen to the reviews on how \\"the bad part about a trilogy is that darn book in the middle\\", because it isn't true! Suzanne Collins has created a masterpiece of a trilogy, and nothing can change that! \\"Catching Fire\\" is an amazing book; AN ABSOLUTE MUST-READ!!!!!!!!!
B006M4F67A|5.0|This is the best game investment out there! Good for your brain & fun especially if you're not in the mood to read.
B0087HT36U|5.0|I know this game is very similar to others, but I still think it's a fun little game and a great way to kill some time.
B004ZJADOU|5.0|Since the great Romanian pianist Radu Lupu is no more willing to enter the recording studios or allow new live captures from his concerts, his numerous aficionados have to deal with his old recordings only. And what fabulous recordings they are!<br /><br />In this view, DECCA label - for which Lupu once used to record exclusively - had the inspiration to pack all his concerto recordings in a single box set and release it to great international acclaim. It is the very box set under consideration here, featuring on 6 CDs all the five concertos by Beethoven, concertos by Mozart (K 414, K 467), Schumann, Grieg and Brahms (no.1) and even some chamber accounts (quintets by Beethoven and Brahms) where Lupu took part as leading guest performer.<br /><br />The special pianism of Radu Lupu is captured here in all its glory. His legendary musicianship shines throughout and invites the listener to travel long distances in order to have the chance to listen to Lupu's scarce live appearances. His partners on these recordings are celebrated conductors such as Zubin Mehta, Andre Previn, Lawrence Foster or Edo de Waart and world famous orchestras such as Israel Philharmonic or London Philharmonic Orchestra.<br /><br />Although all these recordings were previously released, the collection they are gathered in now deserves all our praise. It is a priceless heritage by a super-class pianist. Lupu is a consumed musician for whom music is a worthy way only as an uncompromising, utterly assumed life-experience. His artistic honesty prevails over any career temptations or public-oriented gestures (which are to him completely alien) and acts as an inexhaustible source of inspiration for the interpretations of this iconic figure of our age's musical life called RADU LUPU.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Reacher fun as usual!  How he deduces the plots is real fun and fascinating.  Lots of twists and turns, in normal Reacher fashion.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Has a great story line that keeps you wanting more! Plus a little more of him, too! Great book to sink into. Like a grown up fairytale. Just rated R. (:
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Very captivating and interesting. Could not put this book down. Can not wait to read the rest of the series!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|This could have been a short story more sex than plot just got a little tedious but it was ok
B008IJT0CE|5.0|This app has helped me a lot to sleep. The price is so worth it!!! The free virsion is nice as well that's what I started with. And I am a person that wont buy anything that's not worth while. As I only buy something that's a good deal like ill wait months for a good deal before I will buy it. so the fact that I wont buy apps as I see it as a waist of money this should tell you its worth it. Being an insomniac I LOVE THIS APP.<br /><br />Thank you Ipnos Software Inc if I could would give you 100 stars keep up the great work

B0092MKTL2|5.0|i love this CD. from top to bottom, it's full of imaginatively orchestrated songs that are much better than most of the stuff out there right now. standouts are radioactive, it's time, demons, on top of the world, and nothing left to say.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Glad I read this book.  I have new repect of our service men and women and what they go thru for us.  I could almost feel the adrenaline as they were in the compound.  Good job.

0525953728|3.0|Interesting reading. Not sure how factual. Navy Seals should honor their country and not write a book about secret missions.
034580404X|5.0|received my books on Monday as promised have not been able to put it down already read the first book of the trilogy
0316228532|5.0|It's clear that J.K. Rowling is done with unfolding the shining wonder of the magical world.  She plunged also into the darkest depths of her magical world, and is in need of a change of pace from that as well.  The Casual Vacancy is her exploration of the banal and ordinary, the flat concrete grey in contrast to the brilliant chiaroscuro of the light and dark of her Harry Potter books.  There is no hero, no villain, in this book, but rather a small town full of characters of varying importance and qualities.  Their concerns could not be any more petty and unimportant to the greater world.  Everyone hates each other in The Casual Vacancy, and the most positive reaction I felt about any character was pity.  The rest of them I despised more and more as events progressed.  They all enjoyed each other's suffering, and I could hardly care, either, and yet Rowling still managed to make me cry at the end.<br /><br />The only moment I thought this mundane book could possibly have existed in the same England as Harry Potter was when I read this quote:  \\"People in Krystal's mother's circle died prematurely with such frequency that they might have been involved in some secret war of which the rest of the world knew nothing.\\"  Of course, this turns out to be because they are clearly all heroin addicts, drug dealers, or some other kind of unspecified criminal, not witches and wizards.  However, the brilliancy and quality of Rowling's writing skills shines all the brighter for the dreary subject matter.  For example, a quote:  \\"Kay noticed a used condom glistening in the grass beside her feet, like the gossamer cocoon of some huge grub.\\"  Nobody has ever or will ever describe this particular piece of trash the same way, and I am impressed because she both highlights its unnnoticed beauty and accentuates the general disgust felt by the viewer in the same sentence.<br /><br />I read Rowling's Harry Potter books because I like my fiction to be an escape from reality.  This book is not like that; it is a reminder of all the things in reality that we seek to escape.  Reading The Casual Vacancy made me feel like a voyeur, spying on the lives of these townspeople, and privy to even their inner thoughts.  Rowling does an excellent job of managing her large cast of characters, and quickly introducing them as individuals to the reader, both via the internal feelings each has, and the reactions and descriptions of them by others.  If I were to re-title this book, I would call it Sins of their Fathers, which is at once more memorable than The Casual Vacancy, and far less intriguing.  If you've overlooked the Harry Potter books because you think they are childish, I think Rowling wrote this one for you.  I imagine you'll enjoy the vulgarity more than I did.
B006C1DH92|1.0|why no free fruit ninja puss in boots.??? they need it. or else I'm not buying anymore games. bye bye games.
B00009QNY5|1.0|I purchased this movie for my boyfriend as a joke because we are remodeling our first home. I was excited to get such a good deal on the movie and that it shipped so quickly. Upon arrival, I knew I had made a mistake. The packaging is cheap and fake looking. I put the DVD in my player and it wouldn't play stating an error. I live in the US and this disc was unable to play outside of it's original country where it was burned. Very disappointed overall,but I should have known better.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|I was about to purchase this at a big box store when my husband suggested I check Amazon's price. The movie was cheaper so we ordered it from my cell while still in said store. By the time we got to the car I received an email that included with it was the Amazon Video version as well! So after dinner and the kids going to bed (this movie is not for the 7 year old crowd!) my husband and I sat down and watched it. We really enjoyed the movie - though there were a few moments in the streaming version that we were not able to understand what was being said. Watching through our tv bypasses our receiver and has only basic stereo speakers. We are not sure if that was the reason or if it was a streaming hiccup. There was also one moment where the picture pixelated a bit, but only one. Watching the Bluray once it arrived provided the richness of audio that I love and I was able to understand everything said. I also heard things that I didn't even hear before (like twigs breaking, the roar of a fire, etc.). We really enjoyed the movie. For streaming I would recommend that you are able to have 5.1 audio at least and a really strong/consistent internet connection. For Bluray, you still need at least 5.1 audio. But definitely watch this movie! Looking forward to the next one.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Great Book!  This was a very informative book which kept my attention.  No SEAL secrets were revealed.  Recommended for all to read.
B006GH6IS4|5.0|Watched this and \\"The Great Prentender\\" documentary this weekend.  This one is great and far superior to the other.  I'm glad I purchased this one.  I regret purchasing the other.
B005K17RU0|5.0|It is great to know what my weather is and not have to go searching for my city.  For anyone who likes to know quickly what their weather is than I would recomend AccuWeather.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Loved the way this book was written. I felt that this Sniper is a real person with real emotions, not some fictional character. He said what he felt and did not sugar coat it for all those feel good people out there. The knowledge that he shared about having to report every kill, even in the middle of battle is an eye opener. Every moment running through your mind Rules of Engagement while your life is on the line so you are not prosecuted by your government that sent you into the very hell hole your trying to survive is beyond any words I can come up with. I felt as though this book opens your eyes a bit more to the fact of this war and the reality of it; than what the main stream media tries to make you believe. Chris Kyle's book has inspired me to become more active in volunteering my time to our veterans, as well as our current service men and women.
B000007492|5.0|Blah, Blah, Blah, Blah... you are going to love this album.  Blah, Blah, Blah, Blah blah... Did I say you were going to love it?  I do.  Highly recommend.
B00005N6KG|2.0|I should have known but I'm a slow learner. I've had this pair in the past and forgot how I didn't like them. It produces a hollow sound that lacks stereo. I'm getting used to it and they will work until they get broken. THEN I'll buy a pair that works a lot better.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|This is one of the best things I've read since \\"Fall of Giants\\".  I can't wait for the third installment.  This book brings the World War II era to life.  The characters come to life, you feel like you personally know them.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I started with this series because I needed a Christian Grey fix. The first book Bared to You was so close to the Fifty Shades of Grey series it was mind boggling. I did however enjoy it. So when I got to Reflected in You I expected another mirror image. Boy was I surprised and really glad that Ms. Day took the route she did! I enjoyed the twist and turns...even the emotional highs/lows. I felt what Eva felt and that made the book for me. Great job with this one...now I am impatiently waiting for the next one!
0451228375|5.0|This book is a classic, and a fanatstic follow up to Pillars of the Earth, which in my view, is the best book written on this time period in England.
B005NFW0U0|5.0|This summer my daughter talked me into watching season 1 with her.  She thought I would like it. Luckily she also had purchased season 2 also. So then I went and bought this season 3.  What a great summer spent with my daughter, Damon and Stephan. Bummed that I wil be on a plane during the 4th season opening.  Hurrah for On Demand and go Team Damon
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I loved it<br /> I was a bit frustrated it was to be continued but excited as well. I will be gettting the second game to play as well

B00571F26Y|5.0|the timing of this book could not have been more perfect. logical, simple truths, well laid out and profound. I have adopted his ideas and eating plan. thank you Dr.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|this game is so awesome i play it all the time and it works best on a kindle fire but thats what i think. u would be stupid not to by this game get it or die
B008OOYALE|5.0|ive been waiting for the goals on kindle fire and they finally have them! it makes it so much better like this
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I found this app very relyable and very cool but the only reason I wrote this is because it wouldn't stop asking
B0063GORYU|5.0|Great game ! I enjoy playing it ! Play it almost every day.Anyone who loves solitary games would enjoy playing this game.
0316228532|2.0|I don't think I would have purchased this if I had downloaded the sample for the Kindle first.  But I respect JK Rowling's talents so much that I just bought it.  She is much more talented than this.  Whether a book for kids or a book for adults, this is not worthy of Rowling.  So far, I am reading through a litany of character \\"development\\", but have not found one likable character.  Except for the reaction to the death of the council member, there doesn't seem to be a plot, and frankly, I wouldn't care what happens to any of these people if there were.  For someone so talented at creating DIVERSE characters and memorable locations, this is completely underwhelming and forgettable.
1452101248|5.0|With a large collection of cookery books I'm rarely looking to buy a new one.....except this one!  so beautiful, so delicious, so easy - what more is there to say.  A wonderful wedding gift...I might not cook every one...but I hope to try at least 75% of them.
B005G5PPGS|4.0|I am very impressed with the book \\"MoneyBall\\" I have seen the movie but like most times the book is better than the movie. You will especially enjoy this book if you are in to baseball.
B005DJGMQE|5.0|wow...this movie had me completely into the plot...and never knowing where it was going to end up was moving enough. the cast were incredible to say the least...the plot was true to its time. the situation was also true to its time...the public often only wanted someone/something to pay for the unjust acts. truly a great movie to watch...truly.
B0099G4Y26|5.0|I think this is Pink's best album yet.  Every song is good.  Can't wait to see her perform live in March!
B007GCY8FS|4.0|I keep wanting to see a movie with Jack Reacher being played by a well known action star but realize he is too small to measure up.  This latest story (I've read 'em all) is good but not satisfying, I'm sorry but like a spoiled child I want more Lee. I'll go ahead and preorder the next story.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|I have read every single Reacher Novel.  This one was OK, just.  It was nice to read a<br />Reacher story again, but that was it really.  It picked up almost right where the last one ended....his nose was still smashed in.  I don't know, maybe I've just come to expect a little more.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I have ADHD and I have the hardest time sitting still. This game helps me focus and listen haha because it keeps my mind busy and i have fun trying to pass levels. In my opinion it is a must have!
B0017SWPXY|4.0|Loved this book.  I liked his analogies between racing and living life.  Was so creative to write it from the perspective of the dog.  Would definitely read another of his works.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|This is a great read.  All of the training these guys must go through must really create a strong brotherhood.  I am very glad we have guys like this to protect us, even thought we may never know what they are doing for us.  Thank you for writing this book.
B001I999C2|5.0|I think this movie is a really nice portrayal of the Drum and Bugle Corps experience.  What really impressed me was the way the subject of an inner city black male maid his transiton trough a  Southern all black college experience was handled.............
B007MD2RHC|5.0|THIS ALBUM OPENS A NEW MUSICAL ERA LIKE \\" TUBULAR BELLS \\"OF MIKE OLFIELD, \\" WATERMARK \\" OF ENYA OR \\" CHARIOTS OF FIRE \\" OF VANGELIS. ALL THE TRACKS ARE INCREIBLE, VERY BEATIFUL AND NICE !, MR. BERGENSEN IS A GENIAL COMPOSER.<br /><br />I HOPE WITH VERY ILLLUSIONS THE NEW ALBUM OF THIS MUSICIAN,... ! \\" SUN \\" !.....
B00571F26Y|5.0|I have been off wheat for approx. 1 month now and have no cravings for it whatsoever. This book has so many great recipes that you'll  never know the difference anyway. I like that the diet outlined does not restrict dairy (I love my cheese!) and the baked cheesecake is to die for. I feel fantastic - really light, my muffin top is shrinking (after 2 kids-woohoo) and I highly recommend this book, worth every cent and so much more.
1423113381|5.0|Great book i would def recomend it to any one who likes mythology or just who likes a good read
B008SVS3FC|4.0|If my memory serves, this is John Hiatt's third album in as many years.  And yet this record continues Hiatt's unblenished stetch of releases featuring his trademark flair for storytelling.<br /><br />Set against a backdrop of uncomplicated, mature musicianship, the album kicks-off with the upbeat \\"We're Alright Now,\\" a song about love enduring the passage of time.  But like most of Hiatt's releases, there is the usual cast of ornery characters.  \\"Bite Marks\\" and \\"Wood Chipper\\" make reference to just how tough love and relationships can be.<br /><br />Hiatt's sandpaper-tinged voice is a little more subdued here than on past releases.  But it has always been his lyrical word-play and wit that has drawn me to his music.  He doesn't disappoint on this release.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|Great game. It will keep you entertain for a couple of minutes then it becomes a waiting game. It takes some time to get more coins. That's why it didn't get a 5 star.
B008C1O8CA|3.0|Amazon's customer reviews for this release are all over the map.  Mine will have to fall somewhere in the middle.  After two well-received, ambitious, concept-type records in \\"American Idiot\\" and \\"Twenty First Century Breakdown,\\" Billy Joe Armstrong and the boys return to their mid-90's punk-pop roots of irrelevant, profane goofiness.  And that's not a bad thing.<br /><br />I am not the biggest of Green Day's fans, but what I like about them is their penchant for writing the occasional power-pop gem.  First single \\"Oh Love,\\" which actually closes the record, ranks right up there as one of their best.  Lead-off track \\"Nuclear Family\\" and follow-up \\"Stay the Night\\" are also strong efforts.<br /><br />I am curious to hear the second and third albums in this trilogy.  But overall, this record just lacks punch. The hooks are there, but a less-polished, more straight-ahead approach in production may be what it needed.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Oh George!  I read all five of your books in a row and I am hooked but oh so mad!  You left me hanging regarding some of my favorite characters AGAIN! I admit I was not as happy with book four and all the new characters featured.  I don't want to care about the fate of any new characters. I have my quota with the original characters. Thank heavens you got back to them in book five.  Hooray! Seriously, book five advanced the action for Daenerys, the Starks and the Lannisters in dramatic and, at times, shocking ways.  George, your extraordinary creativity in crafting unusual environments and interactions while keeping the characters very recognizably human shines in \\"Dragons\\".  The surprise (to me) at the turns of events in the latter parts of the book has me completely puzzled as to where you will take the multile plots.  When does book six come out?
B008QE9XD2|2.0|I had semi raised expectations for this film based on friends reviews. Maybe<br />they watched a different movie or just smoke too much crack.<br />Tim Burton just needs to retire. Whatever he had before he definitely has lost<br />and it ain't comin back. The premise was a fairly funny one at the beginning<br />but then Barton stuck it in a blender and it became a disjointed mess.<br />Also. All the lady leads could handle a film on there own, But this was estrogen<br />overload. Plus the only lady who wasn't fawning over Johnny's gentitals was michelle<br />pheiffer. I could have taken this for what is was, if it could've decided what it<br />wanted to be. Instead as Frankenstein's monster, it's better off dead.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I am amazed at what trash comes to be No. 1 on the charts! The mind boggles to imagine who are the people buying this book?<br />Its not even good porn
B008KNUKVI|5.0|Hey if you don't know this group get to know them. Have waited for this since Sing-Off season 3. They are awesome. The best Acappella group I have ever had the pleasure of listening to. Yea Pentatonix. Get this at Amazon.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This is an amazing app for the Fire. Very user friendly and addictive! I spend a lot of time browsing on Pinterest for recipes and crafts. A must-have app for Pinterest users!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Both the topic, plot line and plot construction were new, clever and refreshing to read.<br />It was hard to put down.  Our discussions in our Cloak&Dagger Book Club were stimulating and<br />with depth and empathy.  The  characters were well described and embellished.<br /><br />We, all agreed that we intend to read more literature by John Landay.<br /><br />Great Read!!!!!!!!!
B008MG1E4A|2.0|Had higher expectation. A drawing of the compound would have helped  a reader who was never there.  The o Ed use of acronyms was annoying, especially for non military person, who has no idea what they mean.<br />If it was 10 pages book would have been emoughf, only interesting part was the actual raid.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|this book is fantastic...it cotinues with the characters of fall of giants, with them growning up and older.... not finished but can't put it down...it is a long book but that is ok.....I am learning more history and it follows the world crisis that went on in the 30's and 40's.....you can be sure i will pre-order his third book of the trilogy.....
B0083SBMBM|5.0|Many of you younger people out there (and those of you who didn't collect comics in your youth) don't remember when Stan Lee got up on his soap box (I believe this was back in 1977) and he promised us that he was going to be creating some movies for the people that were fans of Marvel comics.<br /><br />He promised us an X-Men movie.  He promised us a Silver Surfer movie.  He promised us a Sub-Mariner movie.  He promised us a Spider-Man movie.  He promised us an Iron Man movie.  He promised us an incredible Hulk movie.  He promised us a Fantastic Four movie.  He promised us a Conan the Barbarian movie.  He promised us a Captain America movie.<br /><br />And he promised us an Avengers movie.<br /><br />Being a small child at the time (I was about ten years old when he made this announcement) I didn't realize how complicated and expensive it could be to make a movie.  I assumed that all of these movies would be up on the big screen within a year or two.<br /><br />I certainly didn't realize that it could take over three decades for a movie to come out!<br /><br />And yet, despite the long wait, I think that this movie was worth waiting for.<br /><br />Back in the 1970s we wouldn't have had awesome special effects, costumes, props, sets and other eye-candy that we have in this 2012 movie.<br /><br />Back in the 1970s we wouldn't have had this absolutely breathtaking rendition of the S.H.I.E.L.D Helicarrier.<br /><br />Back in the 1970s they wouldn't have been able to create the astounding set of combat armor that Iron Man wears in the movie.<br /><br />Back in the 1970s we wouldn't have had this visually impressive CGI Hulk, either.<br /><br />Back in the 1970s an alien invasion fleet trashing New York City wouldn't have looked anywhere near this cool or visually impressive.<br /><br />And let's be honest; who would they have gotten to play Nick Fury, Iron Man and the Black Widow back in the 1970s?  Certainly not Samuel Jackson, Robert Downey Jr. and Scarlett Johansson.<br /><br />And perhaps the biggest tragedy of all would have been the fact that Joss Whedon wouldn't have been able to direct.<br /><br />I'm a big fan of Joss's work on Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Firefly and I was thrilled to hear he'd be directing this movie.  He's a great director with great ideas and his direction and influence took a movie that *could* have been awkward and conflicted and blended in the different characters, plot points, heroes and dramatic moments seamlessly.  And the comedy added into this movie was classic Joss.<br /><br />Many of Tony Stark's line were hilarious, so was the way Black Widow interrogated the Russian arms dealers at the beginning of the movie, as was Stan Lee's line at the end of the movie.<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie to any comic book fan.  I highly recommend it to any Joss Whedon fan.  I highly recommend it to any Robert Downey Jr fan, any Scarlett Johansson fan, any Samuel Jackson fan, or pretty much anybody with a pulse..<br /><br />And perhaps the biggest tragedy of all would have been the fact that Joss Whedon wouldn't have been able to direct.<br /><br />I'm a big fan of Joss's work on Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Firefly and I was thrilled to hear he'd be directing this movie.

B002NNA9N0|5.0|Without a doubt if you are or have been a real salesman living on commissioned sales only, you have experienced some form of this story. I was a Divisional Sales Manager of a six store chain who's employees were selling on a commission only sales platform.<br /> When we had a new hire I required them to watch this movie and then stand up in front of the complete store staff and explain the movie in detail. No cheating here, everyone on staff had seen it and already reported on it so everyone knew the story.<br /> This is one of my All Time favorite movies ever made. Reality of the pressures of closing the sale and earning pay to live. Plus life in reality, the pain, the joy, the compromises, family, Life....How do hot closers get the advantage or do they,how aggressive sales can be in situations where your livelihood depends on that close.<br /> This is an Amazing Cast and everyone in it is spot on with their acting. Some you love, some you are feeling sad & sorry for and some you totally hate. Those who cheat, those who play head games and those who depend on honesty and integrity.<br /> What makes it even better and the acting so strong is it takes place in one room in a night nearly 95% of the time with only one other location scene.<br /> Powerful, strong, aggressive, assertive movie with stellar portrayal of characters.<br /> If you never saw this movie, put that coffee down until you do...Can you close? Are you controlling the pitch or are you being played by the client? Do you have sympathy or empathy? Who are you and how do you get it done?<br /> Start this movie and immediately get sucked into the story. Now pay attention, total attention, undivided attention....Because after all, Coffee Is For CLOSERS !!!!
1433210428|3.0|This book on tape was a great review of the psychology of man. As the book deals with issues, philosophies, theories, and hypothesis's I found myself reviewing what makes me tick. I listened to this with my wife and the book generates live discussions, which could lead to revelations.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Child puts together another solid effort.  Everything builds to the final confrontation and Reacher is unleashed.  If that is your thing, then this book in the series is a must read.
B00471TLZS|2.0|The movie it self is still a classic and I love the book format and packaging but it was a disappointment not to have any special features, behind the scenes and interviews with the actors and director which is common with most DVD'S especially with BLU-RAY. Very disappointing.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|The kids enjoy playing this game.  Not like the Oregon Trail I played as a kid, obviously, but still fun nonetheless.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Okay, whoever is reading this has probably read all of the negative reviews about this book, and let me tell you one thing, all of those negative reviews are incredibly WWWWWWRRRRRRRROOOOOOOONNNNNNNGGGGG!!!!!!!!!!!!!  This book was awesome with hilarious characters that will make you cry and eventually run out of tissues by the end of the series.  I could not put the book down!  I read the whole series in one week, and there is five of the books.  That just shows how deeply in love I fell into with this series.  This was not a waste of money, and I would buy the book a thousand times again if I could.  So, in conclusion if you are still considering buying the book after you read this review, you must have short term memory loss or something.  The whole series is awesome, and I loved it, and I'm rereading it right now.  BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B008RTE066|4.0|I have an Australian copy of Magical Mystery Tour on DVD with stereo soundtrack that I purchased at a Barnes and Noble many years ago, but the picture quality wasn't up to par. So finally, Apple has decided to re-release the Magical Mystery Tour film with fully remastered film and soundtrack. At least they are doing the soundtrack right this time. When I bought the remastered Help! DVD, the soundtrack was only either in stereo or 5.1 DTS. I don't have DTS on my A/V receiver, so I couldn't listen to it in full surround sound. Magical Mystery Tour is in Dolby 5.1 surround sound, so that's a good thing (too bad Help! wasn't). I've seen MMT a few times, and I've had mixed feelings about the film. On the one hand, it's The Beatles, and like many Beatles fans, I tend to scoop up anything Beatles. So seeing them in a film, ANY film is one I'll watch. However, the film is what it is. This was The Beatles first foray into making their own film, doing it their own way, without any real professional help or guidance. And it does show, since MMT doesn't have the type of direction their other movies had (sans Let It Be). But MMT is an enjoyable film nonetheless, and I will be looking for it at Wal-Mart to see what their pricing will be on it. I'll only get the single DVD release. While the box set looks nice, what I'm more interested in is the DVD, and seeing how good the remastering process was for this DVD. So now the question: Will Let It Be come next?? While Beatles fans have clamored for Let It Be to be released and remastered, for the Beatles, this was the one movie they would have probably preferred not to release, since it is essentially as Paul McCartney put it \\"watching the Beatles break up on camera\\". It's got great music, and the rooftop concert can't be beat, but it is a somber chapter in Beatle history. But it does bring to an end what Beatles publicist Derek Taylor once called the Beatles \\"the twentieth century's greatest romance\\".<br /><br />UPDATE (10/9): Todayis MMT day, and I went over to Wal-Mart to get the Magical Mystery Tour DVD. They only had the single DVD though. I didn't see the Blu-Ray version or the box set. Anyways, I got it home and watched it. Apple did a very good job with remastering the movie. For the DVD, everything look pretty crisp and clear. I can only assume how good the Blu-Ray version would look. The audio mastering was very good too. Even the spoken dialogue was cleaned up and sounds good. When I used to watch MMT, I could never understand what the couriers on the bus were saying through the hand held mics during the film. With the audio remastering, you can hear it really good. So it's not just the songs that benefit from the sound makeover, but the movie dialogue as well. The single DVD has a 6 or 7 page book inside the case with pics and liner notes on the DVD. I liked the special features section of the DVD, especially the cut-out scenes from the movie, and the Steve Winwood/Traffic song 'Here We Go 'Round The Mulberry Bush'. I had heard about this song, but didn't know it had been considered for the MMT film. So 4 stars for the remastered MMT film.
0316228532|2.0|This book dissapointed me mostly because none of the charecters were likeable. The focus was always on the worst part of humankind. I was aware going in that this book would be written for adults and not children, but the use of some profanities and descriptions seemed almost crude.  It was still well written from a literary sence, just not enjoyable.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved the third book and found it to be well written.  It was a great ending for this love story.
B0087HT36U|4.0|Good game but don`t like for IGP. Why keep asking to buy when I do not need them. The game is easier to shoot, as no need to worry about the projection. Overall I like this game.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|In today's political spirit of apologizing for being an American I feel proud that the men and women who serve this country are the best in the world as evidenced by the Seals who carried out this mission and others like it that we never hear about. The operators of our special services give up everything to protect our way of life and ask nothing in return but our thanks. These guys and the intelligence analysts who helped bring OBL to justice deserve all the credit. I pray God keeps them safe as they go about their duty to keep us safe. God bless them.  This was an excellent account of the last days and minutes of a truly evil man.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|The watch arrived promptly and well packaged. Has a look and feel of a much more expensive timepiece. The provided strap is very nice, but I have already been using Velcro straps because they are more comfortable, easier to take off/ put on and the design of them takes the strain off the pins, should the watch get caught on something. I like that its automatic, never requiring a battery.<br /><br />Recommend this watch for anyone wanting a good looking, accurate watch for daily use. The days of dropping big money in a status watch are done for me.. Have so many other interests to put that money into.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|Not what I expected after the last one.  I love Lee Child's superhero Jack Reacher and I think all the readers of this series would liked to have had an explanation of how Jack escaped \\"buying the farm\\" in 61 Hours. The story line is not very good and all the characters seemed to be going in circles.  l will still continue to read the series, of course. An addiction is difficult to give up.
0316228532|1.0|Don't bother buying this book if you are a HP fan.  Way too many people to understand what was going on.
B001F12J0C|4.0|I have seen each of these movies a couple of times but now I can watch them whenever I wish to.  I love the action and car chases.  This was a good deal,
B008E77AEK|4.0|If you are into technology you are going to really enjoy this book. If you are at all interested in IT security then you are going to love this book. If you have read Mark's first book (Zero Day) then you are going to find that this one is even better and not just from a plot point of view.<br /><br />What impressed me most about this book was how much more 'story-craft' has gone into it. That alone makes it a better book than 'Zero Day' (which was fantastic anyway). Combined with a great plot and returning characters, I would say this is a really, really enjoyable techno-thriller. It is made even more potent by recent events like Stuxnet and illustrates we are moving into a form of warfare that will mainly conducted on line in the future.<br /><br />The plot is a step up from the first novel 'Zero Day' in that it is centred around nation states doing battle with malware weapons, however the character depth and quality really makes this book shine from others in the field. It is an easy read and would be enjoyed by those without a major technology bent. However, if you are a geek at all then you are going to get so much more from reading this book.<br /><br />I can't wait for the third book (which is coming) and hope that they turn Mark's books into movies. It is perhaps not surprising that someone who develops such great software (Sysinternals) can produce such a high quality work. The most impressive thing is just how much better the writing has developed when compared to the first. Without doubt, Mark's passion and knowledge for his work flows over into his novels and there is little doubt that next one will be better again.<br /><br />I can't wait.
0740745271|5.0|Just what I was looking for.  The book was in great condition and the description was just as it said.  My kids love looking for all the  hidden pictures.  Shipping was fast and on time.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|Shows lots of interesting info. it is very easy to understand the information it is giving. graphics are nice as well.
B003UBTX72|4.0|The best part of the book is the insights into the music, how it came together, how they developed their unique style after starting our covering straight blues.<br /><br />It is a shame that people behave the way they do.  Aside from the drugs and sex which are insane, the music business is pretty sleazy and people cannot get along or be trusted at all.  you have to wonder why it seems to always work out that way.
B0098XY5VK|5.0|Fast paced, so much fun and certainly can be extremely competitive.  The only thing I didn't like was when I went to purchase the game so I could move on to Yankees Stadium it said payment wasn't available thrum my kindle :-(
0307474259|5.0|A couple we love and respect followed this author's suggestions with excellent results for their improved health plus substantial weight loss.  Each of them recommended the book wholeheartedly due to the substantial research included. The current recommendations by most medical authorities stress low-fat eating habits (the system we have followed since 1960) and yet the weight gain nationwide remains quite large.  The studies review diets on various Native American reservations and observations of families whose incomes do not allow for adequate protein, etc.  The studies began many years ago and are quite informative.  The lean, athletic tribes became obese and inactive on reservations where food allotments were based on corn, flour and sugar.<br /><br />I do not hesitate to recommend this book.  It was painstakingly researched.  My doctor was not worried about my plan to follow it because another of his patients had experienced excellent results. Having had a serious stroke 17 years ago, elevated blood pressure is certainly problematic.  My doctor was delighted with my latest BP reading as well as the loss of a few pounds.  The benefits vary but most involve improved blood pressure readings, diabetic numbers, etc and weight loss. This plan seems easier than strict, limited diets.  Best wishes to you if you give it a try!

B0085LGL5E|5.0|This album is very good. I am very happy with my decision to purchase this album. The music on this album is high-energy and not a little bit raucous. If you like, say, The Hives' previous four albums, you may well like The Hives' Lex Hives, too.

B004H4XDBI|5.0|I'm a teacher, so I don't have much time to read, but it's my escape, so I do it often.  I've read several other books since these, but I want to read more by this author.  I don't think it matters how young or how old a person is for him or her to really enjoy both of these books.  After reading Where She Went, I HAD to read If I Stay, and I wasn't disappointed.  I especially like how things ended up at the end of If I Stay.  It's the way it should be, when so often it isn't.  Thank you, Amy Serk (I don't want to butcher your last name!) for having Where She Went (and other good books) in your classroom and sharing them with me!!
B007IXWKUK|2.0|I found this to be a disappointing sequel, it was boring and the incessant e-mails printed out in their entirety was sophomoric.

B005SFR7YE|5.0|We have seen the Broadway production of Phantom, and it was wonderful. We also have the movie version, which is not so wonderful. However, anything at The Royal Albert Hall is special, and this is no exception. It is far and away the best production that we have seen, although my personal favorite, Beyond the Point of No Return, was done the best in the movie version. I love that the orchestra is on stage, above the stage on a special platform that can rise and lower. The whole production is 5 star.
030758836X|1.0|I don't understand how people liked this book.  It was odd, depressing, and quite unrealistic.  It was all I could do to finish.  The book accompanied me on a vacation, and I didn't bring an alternative.  My idea of a vacation read is not diving into a couples gross disfunction.  I don't recommend it.  There are so many great books to read, don't waste your time on this one.
B006GHA9QQ|3.0|We were disappointed with the musical. It really isn't up to Lloyd Webber's standard. The first act was so boring that we nearly turned it off, but we stayed with it to the end. The second act was much more satisfying.
B005FISBTO|5.0|this is our favorite show ! i highly recommend you watch the seasons in order however. definitely an adult show, not for children! but in my opinion its the best show on television currently.

B002ZG99TA|4.0|When this movie came out in theaters i was unsure if i wanted to watch it but i decided to watch it because i know someone who worked with CSX during the real incident and assisted in the effort to stop the real CSX locomotive 8888 (the real incident is known as the Crazy Eights Incident). Anyway i went into the movie thinking \\"i don't know, how great could a movie about a train be?\\" Well i was completely shocked at how much i liked the movie it was really good and full of suspense even at the beginning before the train is sent off unmanned under power. It is much like the calm before the storm because you know going into the movie that at some point that train will be set loose. This doesn't allow you to relax it keeps you on the edge of your seat as you watch...wondering...waiting... Once the train is set loose it is non stop suspense as the train threatens everyone in the vicinity of it with its speed, weight, cargo and shear power. Honestly the train almost takes on its own demon-like persona one of the few other films i have seen that is able to make a vehicle look like the villain is the 1970's film \\"Duel\\" much like the tractor trailer in that film the train in this film is ominous when you see it on the screen it makes your heart pound as it heads toward a crowded crossing, not slowing, not hesitating just coming and fast. This film is a guaranteed high-speed edge of your seat suspense ride.<br /><br />Really good movie 4/5 stars i recommend it to anyone!
B008DB2Y3O|5.0|I must first say that this year has featured albums from the heavyweights in the Pop world Justin Biebers Believe, One Directions Up All Night. But \\"Elevate\\" by Big Time Rush is by far the most fun, well rounded album<br /><br />The Title Track Elevate kinda describes the whole album it has a fun and upbeat feel that really makes you wanna jump up and down and this album ranges from Party Anthem (Windows Down) to Beautiful Melodies (Cover Girl)<br /><br />I wont review every single song but my Favorites are Superstar, If I Ruled The World, Music Sounds Better With U, and Love Me Love Me as well as the other three I mentioned earlier.<br /><br />I've seen these four in concert this year as well and their vocals are incredible so<br />All Around its a Fantastic Album and the best of the year that featured some stellar pop albums<br />Pick it up you wont regret it
B008K8U13K|5.0|Great sequel! I like how you can do combos, it makes it much easier to play. I was worried about the controls, but I got the hang of it fast enough. Fun boss battles too. But 3 different zones really is not a long enough game. A Sonic pro can beat the game in 15 minutes, not even break a sweat.
034580404X|5.0|Ordered these books after a bunch of people told me I should read them. They shipped really fast. Nothing wrong with them. Read all three in a week. The BEST books EVER!
B009G8GRX6|4.0|I love this new album many of the songs remind me of Muse's other albums \\"Resistance\\" \\"Black Holes and Revelation\\" and \\"Absolution\\" like a culmination of all their other albums really. I enjoy the addition of dubstep, I understand many are upset but I enjoyed it and dubstep is not what I generally listen to.

7885880966|5.0|I am the proud possessor of 7 different \\"Don Giovannis\\" on DVD - not to mention the 10 I have on CDs. But if I had to give them all away, I would hang on for dear life to this one. Not only does it have the best singers possible of that area but the production is simple and delightful - no Regietheater, nothing gimmicky - just the greatest \\"Don Giovanni\\" in every respect.<br />As some who have read my reviews will have noticed, I am not a great one to go into detailed critiques of individual singers. To me, a singer either has got it or hasn't. Well, they all have it. Siepi is in the greatest form and sexy as all get out and Dermota no wimp he. It's just sheer perfection coming together and one simply gets totally engrossed in the music, the drama - in brief, in the opera.<br />And just by the way and the tempi with which Furtwaengler supports all these superstars, you realize that he deservedly was reputed to be one of the greatest conductors of his area.
B007UPNA6Y|3.0|Having read all of the Jack Reacher books, they are now becoming more predictable. In fact i found this one rather boring.Perhaps it is time for Lee Child to rest his character and embark on a new hero with different mojo. I underestand he is in the middle of another book to inflict on us.One can only hope that he takes Jack Reacher to a completely different level, away from the the boring heartlands of America to a completely different location.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I wanted a Bible for my android phone so I downloaded this app. I love it!  It has just about any bible translation that you would want as well as many features I haven't even used yet. You can easily find and swtch between translations, books and verses.. I use it all the time.

1402217722|4.0|\\"The Convenient Marriage\\" is a funny historical romance set in 1770's England. The hero, Rule, reminded me of The Scarlet Pimpernel - he seemed lazy and unconcerned yet he was a lot more aware and athletic than he outwardly appeared. Horatia was charming and very funny at the beginning, but then she behaved rather badly (though not so much so that I stopped liking her). Rule's old enemy and a previous mistress of Rule's did some shocking things to try to break up the marriage. The comic relief mainly came from Horatia's usually-drunk brother and his friend doing their bumbling best to prevent her actions from creating a scandal...and only making things worse.<br /><br />There was a fair amount of historical detail--mainly about the clothing, though some about dueling, highway robbery, and such--woven into the story. I had a hard time putting the book down because of the bad scrapes Horatia and her brother kept getting into, some of them dangerous.<br /><br />There was some explicit bad language. There was no sex. Overall, I'd recommend this funny novel.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I found the third book in this series to be very predictable,  you knew what was going to happen but the journey was a very fun read.  I loved it.
B005MYEQ4U|4.0|I don't like all Woody Allen movies and I'm fairly tired of Owen Wilson, but in this movie they came through for me. The best part was trying to figure out who was going to show up next and testing my knowledge of art and literature. It had uncomplicated characters and an important message to deliver in an enjoyable way. I watched it because it was recomended to me, so I am doing the same for you.
B008RYN44U|2.0|I am sorry... the CD is boring... the songs arent all that good and everything just seems to slink along at less than mid-tempo... its barely interesting and FUN?  There is no fun on this album.  This is one to be sure you listen to it on Spotify and then only buy songs you like.  To me, Settle Down is the best song by a long shot and really the only must have song on the album.  I have been through the album a couple times and all it makes me want to do is listen to something else.  It is extremely underwhelming compared to what I know they are capable of.  I came to give this review mainly as a public service to those who should preview it first.  They made an album that makes the case for buying MP3s of the song on it you like instead of buying the album... which is a real shame.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Jack Reacher is my hero, can't wait for one of his books.  Lee Child is a master author.  Ranks right up there with William Patterson and my other all time favorite,Stephen King.  I grab on to their books as soon as they hit the market.
B0041HU440|5.0|This one slipped through the cracks for me when it was released a few years back... but then I read an interview recently from the owner of Frontiers Records, which keeps releasing great things from so many artists I like.  Anyway, in the review they asked him about any of his favorite albums they have done that sort of went unnoticed.  This was one of the CDs he mentioned... and given how much I like the work they do at his company, I took him on his word and checked it out. I heard a preview of the first song and liked it and the vocals instantly... once I heard it was Marci Free, that was all I needed to know it was worth buying.  I have always been a strong fan of Mark/Marci Free's more rocking work (King Kobra and onward)... the vocals are key to why this CD is amazing.  The layering, the choice of pitch, melody, pace, timing, harmony and all is like a lesson in how to sing vocals and be unique and interesting.  Song to song the vocals will even take on different tones and feels... it is a vocal masterpiece.  The more I have listened to the album, the more I have craved listening to it.  It is solid 80s style hard rock with a touch of hair metal... with strong hooks, great songs, tons of melody, great production and music that matches the vocal mastery.
B000JMKNJ2|4.0|A thief-story meets a fantasy novel and they go out shopping in Venice. From the humble point of view of a non-native speaker, the book was a pleasure to read. The only drawback, though it can be a major one at times, is that the constant flashbacks and/or interludes are sometimes really anti-climatic, especially in the last part when action became more fast paced.

B005LAIHZE|3.0|If we are to believe half of the things that we learn about Abe Lincoln from this new movie, he was a far greater man than we give him credit for. I'm not even talking about slaying vampires, though good work on that ol' Abe, keeping America safe for democracy from vamps and all. But how about chopping down a tree with one sing of an axe, defying gravity while ridding piggyback on an old stead, okay a magnificent stallion. I guess what I'm saying is, this movie requires a whole four scores and then some suspension of disbelief. If you can do such, it's a not too bad, but hardly memorable addition to the over crowded sub-genre of vampire flicks.<br /><br />Coming from Russian born director Timur Bekmauketov, who has directed the equally facile, but stylish Wanted and the Night/Day Watch movies. His stuff looks good, no question, he keeps the camera moving and the action always on the go, but it never adds up to anything of substance. Based on a graphic novel of the same name by Seth Grahame-Smith, who also wrote the muddled script. Everything has a cartoonish look and feel, the CGI vamps most of all, so there are no scares and little atmosphere. Highlighted by so astonishing action set pieces in the third act, especially the showdown upon a fast moving train.<br /><br />Benjamin Walker makes a passable Lincoln, though one would suspect the real honest Abe had to have been charismatic to reach the political heights that he did. Given a truly superb make-up job, there are forty-five people credit with the various make-up and hair styles, etc used to successfully turn Walker into an unmistakable Abraham Lincoln. The supporting cast is especially strong with good work coming from Rufus Sewell and Mary Elizabeth Winstead as the picture's main villian and Mary Todd, respectably, but the real scene stealer is Dominic Cooper, the English actor so good last year in the criminally underrated the Devil's Double, here playing Abe's partner in vampire staking with a secret agendaall his own.<br /><br />In all, I can be said that Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter, is nothing special and hardly a must see. However, there is an audience prime and waiting for this kind of movie. And as it is, it is a pretty fun mindless, but utterly forgettable film. At least on DVD/blu-ray you can avoid the awful 3-D that I saw it in when I went to the multiplex.<br /><br />Check out my reviews at moviezonemagazine.com
B001GA1RFA|5.0|I read this book years ago, and just recently purchased it for my Kindle. I am a math and biochemistry major, and so I loved the fact that the book incorporated real mathematical equations with John Green's great, comical writing style. I appreciate the fact that Green went the extra mile to ensure that the math was real, and went on to explain the formulation of Colin's equation. I also loved the book because I just enjoy John Green's writing style - pop fiction without making you feel like a 12 year old. It's a great read - I would recommend it to anyone, especially math nerds like myself.
B005LAIH5O|2.0|To say that Wrath of the Titans is marginally better than Clash of the Titans is like saying your glass of water isn't as wet, if anything it's the density of the cup it's in it. I might have liked Wrath slightly more since I wasn't expecting to like it any less. I thought a Clash of the Titans redux would have actually been pretty good since the original was no great shakes of a movie to begin with, it was badly written and had hopelessly out of date effects in it's day, it never occurred to me that a remake could actually be worst.<br /> This sequel picks up a decade or so later with the gods all butt hurt because mankind has stop praying to them. So Zeus (Liam Neeson) gets himself kidnapped by his spiteful brother Hades (Ralph Fiennes) and his ungrateful son Aries (Edgar Ramirez). So in a reversal from his Taken role Liam needs his son, Peruses (Sam Worthington) to lead a rescue mission and save his divine derriere.<br /> In what looks like a big budgeted Syfy channel movie, Wrath boasts good looking special effects that manage to remain unengaging and a story that is horribly dull and covers only the most familiar of ground. A few things did cross my mind while watching this movie, first I want to know how is it that the makers can get such talented actors to deliver such unspeakable dialogue with such earnesty. The other is that Rosumund Pike is very beautiful even when covered in dirt, she's also not a bad actress, I wonder why real stardom has remained aloof to her.<br /> Told in a completely straight manner, this movie never has any fun with it's silly premise. It takes it's self far too seriously. At least the wonderful Bill Nighy has a few good moments as Hephaestus, he gets to mock the \\"release the Kraken\\" line, talk about seducing a mermaid and has a moment reminisce of the Black Knight from Monty Python and the Holy Grail.<br /> At least the 3-D effects are an improvement over the last time, at least I assume so, I didn't actually see it in the third dimension, but unlike it's predecessor it was filmed in 3-D. I'm glad that I did not see it in such as I probably would have hurt myself trying to pull off the ridicules cobwebs masquerading as facial hair on Neeson.<br /> If you liked the first movie, you might like this one. If you like Greek mythology, good movies or entertainment, then I would suggest passing this one over. Worth a few laughs, but awful lugubrious getting there.<br />Check out my reviews at moviezonemagazine.com

B005LAIGP0|4.0|When the movie starts the first thing that I notice is the logo for the new Hammer film productions. Hammer studios, if you do know, were a British film company that in the 40's and 50's specialized in film noir, science fiction and other modest genre pictures, but there great success and ultimate legacy would be built upon there gothic horror tales that they made in the late 50's through the mid-70's. Helping to cement the careers of stars such as Christopher Lee, Peter Cushing, Oliver Reed, Herbert Lom, Michael Gough, Hazel Court, Ingrid Pitt, Barbara Shelley, and directors Terence Fisher and Freddie Francis. Like the revived Eailing studios (droll British comedy) and Amicus films (anthology horror movies), the names alone have returned in an attempt to reclaim some of the past glories by using a signature still half heartily remembered by fans of movies of yesteryear, happily Hammer is still leading the way in quality fright films.<br /><br />The Woman in Black is the most overt return to their gothic roots, telling a ghost story that lives in the morbid tell tale hearts and fractured minds of misguided youths from days of ole. In other words, this is my terrain, these are the scary stories we are told around camp fires or experience on a Saturday matinee television show, before we would find the more graphic shockers of late night. It's a return to innocence, while letting the goose flesh crawl up on our arms.<br /><br />Set in the Edwardian era and starring former Harry Potter Daniel Radcliffe, here making a fine transition to more mature roles, and Irish character actor Ciaran Hinds, in parts that could easily have been played by Reed and Cushing a few decades back.  Based on Susan Hill's novel, previously filmed for British TV in 1989, with a sequel already in the works. I missed this one in theaters last February, but am grateful that I caught up with it now that it is out on DVD, other than an unnecessary sappy ending, this is good old fashion scary material. Just after seeing the pathetic Apartment 143, here's a scream fest to worm the cockles of my still beating heart.<br /><br />Thanks to no undue gore or torture here, but there are a few good jolts and a nicely scary atmosphere, plus one of the creepiest, but simple final shots in quiet a long time. This is a nightmare suitable for the whole family, and it's well worth the sleepless night.<br /><br />Check out my reviews at moviezonemagazine.com
B001NHNG64|5.0|Lee Child's Jack Reacher is an outstanding character. He's the kind of American hero we love. I'm on book # 6 now and find every book as interesting as the previous one
B006Z7Z3R2|4.0|Another nicely done creep fest that I missed in theaters last February, when it was given a limited theatrical run. The Inkeepers, now out on DVD and blu-ray from Dark Sky films, it combines elements of a 90's slacker comedy with a haunted house story. Starting out as a character piece and slowly descending into horror. This is a little more thoughtful than a lot of terror flicks, more leisurely paced, but all the richer for it.<br /><br />Written, directed and edited by Ti West, who previously directed the excellent old school shocker The House of the Devil (2010). This well written and often very funny movie has two twenty-something , the inkeepers of the title, working in an old hotel with minimal guests on the last week before they are closed and subsequently demolished. They are highly susceptible asthmatic Claire (Sara Paxton) and the slightly older Luke (Pat Healy), who have been tracking a ghost who is said to dwell in the hotel, for sometime on their live internet feed. Not much has happened, so far, so Claire decides to help the proceedings along a bit by trying to make contact with the help of a psychic and former TV sitcom star (played by 80's movie star Kelly McGillis) staying at the hotel.<br /><br />The movie works best when it is focusing on the two amiable main characters and there very humorous interactions. Not so much when the film takes a turn towards horror, but at least it is never graphic enough to completely spoil the feel of the earlier scenes. The ghosts are not well developed, we learn next to nothing about them, which frustrated me a bit. This isn't great, but better than a lot of recent chillers, but I still would have preferred anedy old school indie comedy over the admittedly limited spilled blood<br /><br />check out my reviews at moviezonemagazine.com

B004SIPA4G|5.0|>>> The header of this product is listed as DVD for some reason, despite being a review of a BD purchased via Amazon. Go Figure. >>><br /><br />Frank Miller is a favourite of mine, so I am pretty biased. The books the film is based upon cannot in the strictest term be called 'comics'. But this is heaped into the category of 'comic book film'. And you know what, for some reason that doesn't bother me.<br /><br />Miller, who has always been known for shaking up our perceptions on the definitions of what can be expected in the comic book medium, stuck gold with this solid serialized title. With this film, director Robert Rodriguez redefined what a comic movie could be. And with this version of the BD, they both have redefined the comic book home experience.<br /><br />Packed with featurettes, a sharp 5.1 soundtrack, snarky and witty commentary, and some 20 minutes of additional movie, there's not much to not like about Sin City at all. Hell, Rodriguez even puts a favourite recipe (apparently one that helped him get through the filming process) in the mix, a simple breakfast taco with homemade attentions- and I tried it; it is a simply divine way to spice up an early morning. How many other BDs, let alone DVDs, give you THAT kind of bonus features?<br /><br />We know the count. Sin City was a highly regarded \\"neo-noir\\" TPB series and a highly praised film. Awards, all-star ensemble cast, lots of action, strong and sexy women, lots of action, gore, and lots of action. Frankly, if you are a fan of gritty comics at all and have no knowledge of Sin City and do not own a BD player... well, there's a good suggestion for your first two purchases.<br /><br />It's dark, twisted, violent, and quite possibly one of my favourite films of all time.

B004K4IZ3G|5.0|In a word, yes.<br /><br />Late in my BD collection, but still much loved, TRON: Legacy explodes into light and life, sound and fury. The story starts off almost as a slight segue from the original; we see Flynn (always the marvelous Jeff Bridges) with his son possibly hours prior to getting zapped into the Internet before it was really the Internet.<br /><br />You read that right; the original TRON predates everything except for the vaguest concept of the Internet. If you have not seen it yet, stop reading this review and go watch it. Now.<br /><br />Back? Alrighty. The film then skips 20 years and the son receives a mysterious clue about the whereabouts of his father. Cue special effects. Enter eye candy.<br /><br />The film was beautiful on the big screen, breathtaking in 3D, and even still a powerful experience in 2D HD. The 7.1 soundtrack explodes in your ears, whizzing along and grabbing you for the ride. The quality of the acting is less important than the underscores of the story: is the Creator responsible for the Created, and if so, how do you hold them accountable? Can human existence persist in an artificial environment, and if so how does the concept of The Soul correlate? Can visual effects be used as a primary character in film? And no, I'm not talking about Avatar and other purely CGI films. I'm talking about the visual effects (like some 98% of the film) of the new TRON film acting as a visual construct for the whole of the Internet. Pretty gutsy. And fairly unique. There is literally nothing like TRON and certainly not with the pure spectacle of TRON: Legacy.<br /><br />The BD is rounded out with a goodly handful of featurettes, including a very unique prologue containing what happens directly after the film leaves off. We don't have any Commentary tracks, but then again, both TRON films are intended for the audience to make up their own minds and figure out the meanings therein.<br /><br />The best part is the visuals, hands down. I guarantee, every time you watch this film you will notice something new. Maybe just a small but arresting detail, but it's still there. And if that isn't enough of a good reason to add a movie to your BD collection, I have no idea what would be.ry time you watch this film you will notice something new.

Killing the process doesn't work, adding the process to the whitelist doesn't work, the only thing that stops this is uninstalling the app. Now, I have to install the app when I need it and immediately uninstall it.
B005GHN2GG|1.0|I had high hopes for this book, and then the story seemed to be discarded in favor of an attempt at a romance. Between the predictability of the story line, which was at times absolutely lost in the author's obsession with sexual tension, and lack of clear direction, I was pretty let down. This book had real potential... I wanted a fantasy adventure with maybe a side of romance. What I got was a repetitively bland heroine who had the power to give of herself until she died, all the while being mistreated and taken advantage of (classic self esteem issues with domestic gender inequality maybe?), and an all powerful wizard who apparently is horribly wicked with no proof of such anywhere in sight? Sorry, didn't see that part. More smut than substance really.  not really worth the time to bother with.
B007SGM084|5.0|I absolutely love the books, and I am not a reader, at all. I would however, recommend purchasing the books separate, rather than together, as it is harder to tell where you are in each book. The download only tells you how far along you are in reference to all 3 books, not each book individually.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This really gives you an idea of what our guys are going through in this rugged country.  Our soldiers are amazing and we should all be proud and grateful to them.  Great read.
B008673ZAQ|1.0|** Spoilers in this review **<br /><br />I'm completely amazed at the number of 5-star reviews for a hero who becomes a murderer.  Personally, I don't find anything remotely romantic about a guy like that.  What if Eva decides to leave him someday, or really ticks him off??  Will he consider eliminating her too?  This book was so depressing, but I kept reading thinking Eva and Gideon would resolve some of their separation anxiety and communication issues. Instead nothing was resolved and Gideon turned into a killer.  What a waste of my time!

0307341577|5.0|After reading Gillian Flynn's latest best seller, Gone Girl, I decided I wanted to start reading her earlier novels.  This book is dark and disturbing, but I really liked it.  A classic who-done-it, that centers around Libby Day, whose mom and two sisters were supposedly murdered by her older brother.  It was LIbby's testimony that sealed the fate for her brother and put him behind bars.  Now, twenty four years later, Libby begins to question her own testimony and her brother's guilt.  With the help of a club that looks into high profile murders, LIbby reluctantly begins her own investigation into her past.  The chapters alternate between the present and the day of the murder.  This is a great book that I liked even better than Gone Girl.
B000SEGUDE|1.0|When I started reading it, all I felt was OUTRAGE that I had spent money on it on the strength of its reviews. How anyone can love this disjointed, poorly written collection of short stories I really don't understand. I can honestly say I have never read a worse book. I thought at first perhaps it would get better. It didn't.  I find the stories boring, poorly written-- just a mess.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|The best comic book movie yet!!! I saw this in the theater twice, which is rare for me. I can't wait for the second one. Why don't u have this movie yet?
B006LSZECO|2.0|Oh, I know. How can I say such a convoluted book is predictible. It's because all of the usual characters are there. There's the Drew Peterson character, acting bizarrely upbeat in the face of his wife gone missing. There's the Nancy Grace character persecuting the husband based on questionable \\"facts.\\" And of course, there's the parade of newsreaders camped out wherever they might find a suspect or police detective into whose face they might thrust a microphone to answer their inane questions.<br /><br />The use of personable diary-like stories by each of the main characters gave it away for me, along with the title and the treasure hunt. The treasure hunt especially was a telling clue as to what was going on.<br /><br />No single person in the array of characters was in the least bit surprising. Desi, as rich as he was, was incredibly stupid in not being able to recognize when he was being manipulated. After awhile, people with money develop a manipulation radar. You have money. Other people want it. They will try to charm you out of it.<br /><br />Along with Desi and the others mentioned above, there's the girl's parents, the loser neighbor, the girl in the bar, the Johnny Cochran lawyer, all behaving as we know they will.<br /><br />If anyone had not acted in conformity to what the author seems to think is our American way of justice, the story might have sustained my interest.<br /><br />But I believe that the police are smarter than such books as these give them credit for.
B005LAIHPY|4.0|Based on what I read from the critics, I was ready for a lame, pointless, too many cliched smart talking, poor acting and a an overall good time laughing at the jokers who would waste millions on crap. I must admit, I was surprised, the movie was none of those and in that sense a disappointment. I'll tell you what, this was a lot better than INDEPENDENCE DAY and made the mark as far as tautness for story line went. The special effects are good and consistent, the acting as good as it can get in a movie like this and Brooklyn Decker should have a good ten minutes more of screen time, I could not get enough of her. And as for Rihanna, I was surprised she was not loaded with crazy one liners and smart ass comments you would expect to hand out, it was a pleasant surprise all around. Its not a great movie, but its not a bad one. I think the unified  bad reviews it got all around has the inkling of a conspiracy around it, very strange.
B009CYCF5I|5.0|I got the limited edition version with the bonus tracks at target for $14.00!!  Why pay $30 when you can get it for half that!
B008F5Y7UQ|5.0|Very much enjoyed this movie.  It dealt with real emotional issues, and real people. The emotional issues were plausible and not overly dramatized.  And yet, there was a story to tell; a crazy, interesting and fun story.  Makes you happy and thoughtful.  A nice movie to share.
B008XFAT7S|5.0|I love action/fighting movies and this one was pretty phenomenal. The story is pretty much as advertised. A special forces unit in Jakarta goes into a drug lords tower to take him out, only the kingpin is expecting them, and they end up trapped, trying to fight their way back out. Simple. What wasnt simple was the choreography for the fight scenes. There were legitimately moves and acts in the midst of many of the fights that had me gripping my chair, tense, and thinking \\"Holy @#$%\\" or looking on with disgusted fascination.<br />Watch this movie. You need to see it if you love martial arts flicks.<br />Enjoy!
B008Y212PI|5.0|I love all the flippix games. they keep me entertained for hours. well worth the money to download. I wish there were more games like this.
B0000025KI|5.0|Finger-snapping, toe-tapping fun.  Bruce is fabulous and so is each member of the wonderful E Street Band.  I could listen to this over and over and over.  And then to hear any one of these songs at a concert is just too much fun.  Isn't it something how they sound the same in person as they do on a record?!  I just love them all!!
B0042X9L6A|5.0|Product came in original packaging and was awesome as I used it! The best flash I have ever worked with!
B00846REIS|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. I am looking forward to the  next part of the series.  A much better read than 50 Shades.
B005UVYXPW|5.0|I haven't missed a single episode.  They have all been 5 stars.  Full of excitement, emotions, drama.  A super talented cast!!!
B003YL4LYI|2.0|I loved the first 3 books.  Literally could not put them down.  The 4th started getting way too detailed and draggin on.  No closure and GRRM keeps introducing even more characters and \\"losing\\" some.  This 5th book actually became boring and I lost interest.  The story line skips back in time and retelling story lines that have already been covered.  I'll probably read the next one, but if there isn't closure, that will be it for me.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|This book blew my mind!! You can tell as you are reading that Rothfuss does not waste a single word... everything means something. The basic plot and characters are awesome - so interesting, so different from anything else I've read. But on top of that, there are so many hints and mysteries just waiting for you to brainstorm... it's like there's a whole second layer to the story. Every detail brings you a bit closer to cracking the mystery of what's going on in the bigger picture. One of the most intelligent, well thought-out books that I've read in a long time (same goes for the second book of the series). I can't WAIT for book three.
B0086700CM|5.0|Why is it a boy why couldn't a girl do it nude it would of been awesome.Also it thinks I'm sliding when I turn and that I turn when I'm sliding
159102594X|5.0|I loved this book and the rest of the series. It is gritty, realistic, and a bit dark. I think that fans of George RR Martin will for the most part love this author - it has that same combination of flawed, 3-dimensional characters and sometimes painful harshness. But in a good way. The plot is interesting, the POV characters are well developed, and the twists keep you guessing. There are some highly descriptive battle scenes but not too many where it bogs the plot down. It is not heavy on \\"magic\\" and certainly not an elves and ogres type of fantasy. A lot more battles and political maneuvering than magical type stuff. I'm looking forward to reading the rest of his standalone novels from the same world.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved this book! I couldn't put this whole series. The ending threw me off quite a bit though. It was pretty anticlimatic compared to the rest of the books but I would recommend reading all three books!
B0089IGUP4|4.0|I recently moved to NJ and was interested in finding recordings by artists from this State.  The Gaslight Anthem CD \\"Handwritten\\" is nice to listen to.  Don't expect Bon Jovi or Springsteen, but this group holds its own.  They were recently on \\"The Tonight Show.\\"
B007FG9LIE|4.0|This book by Blake Crouch will keep you guessing from the very first page, right to the last. Well written, and quick-paced, suspenseful and sometimes frustrating when you think you have it all figured out, the plot changes. Enjoyed this book very much.
B008XG1X18|3.0|Good flow and layout but it freezes and sometimes will not load. I'm hopeful an update will come out soon.
B007YOC4RW|5.0|I'm a big fan of Joe Bonamassa and his rockin blues style. It's like having new rock n roll the way I liked it back in the 60s and 70s. Since rock n roll is the child of blues, it's all a natural fit. Joe's music gives fans of the blues and fans of classic rock some new music to mix into the old favorites.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|this product works just as advertised. icarry mine with me everywhere igo, just in case my pocket knife needs a little edge, or i.m waiting around with nothing to do and feel like getting it extra sharp. and the file is great for the 'teeth' on a knife as well. highly recommended!
B003B02O3C|5.0|Grisham always gives a good mystery.  My favorite modern author.  His stories are all original, and don't need unnecessary gratuitous sex and violence to tell a tale.  Good stuff.
B002JWD6AS|5.0|This is a amazing book! I've read this book and its sequal, and I'm currently on the the third book! It's a great trilogy to read. Full of adventure and forbidden romance and a race against time! Its a must read.
B008BM9L72|2.0|I would have liked to give this Trilogy 2.5 stars.  The Trilogy was just to much  of the same old thing.  It was getting a bit boring in the second book but in the third, I had to do a lot of skip reading to get to the grid of the story.<br />Not well written.<br />Definitely not a book club book.  I can see why the young like this book, it is because there are nothing els that is brave enough to write about sex and pleasure in a easy read on the train kind of book, that I know of. I am sure about 75% of the sales went to women.<br />I do hope that they do not make a movie out of this!!
B002ZBJ6SY|5.0|THIS ALBUM IS SURE TO PLEASE. THE GUTAR RIFFS ARE SPECTACULAR AND SHAWNS VOICE IS THE RIGHT BLEND OF PAIN AND PLEASURE.
031603441X|5.0|The book itself is pristine. The writing is really good. This is possibly the best biographical book dealing musicians ever. It is not chapter after chapter of sensationalism. KR in his in his interviews appears to be incoherent, though if one listens closely he is anything but. This book gives us a view of his musical prowess as well as his personal development plus a little scandal too. Well worth having, great read.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|MAJOR ISSUE! How could you not be able to browse photo albums? Not even your own. I'd much rather use facebook on my phone.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Ken Follett is one of my favorite authors.  The story line keeps me interested and gives an idea of what individuals and families experienced during the period of history he writes about.  He makes history live for me!
B003SI7OQ4|5.0|Watched it with my kids and I was just as entertained as they were. Great movie. I recomend it to anyone....kids or not.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Installed the Kindle Fire version of Pinterest app and was quickly whiling away more time looking at boards and updating my own. Now I can indulge in this guilty pleasure with even greater ease.
1469984202|5.0|Never heard of this book or author but saw the reviews and thought, \\"why not\\"?<br /><br />Wow.<br /><br />The Wool omnibus edition builds a story, timeline and characters in a comprehensive manner I've not read in a long time. While you think you know where the plot is going, it doesn't. Then it does. Then it doesn't again.<br /><br />Brilliant.
B0067TGSOK|5.0|Great little motivational book with useful tools to help you along the way. The One Page Business Plan (talked about in the book) is incredibly valuable for it's simplicity.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|Sarah's Key was written very well and caught my interest right away.  The  characters were in my heart thru the whole book. I was crushed when Sarah made it back to her apartment.  Against all hope I wanted her return to come out differently.  It was a book that I didn't want to put down.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game. You can win coins and acorns.....it means this game (unlike others) IS actually free!!!!  Only one thing I would change is that I would add more games like 'kung fu Scrat'.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Wow- this book is much better than the first; quality of writing, characters' dialogue, plot twists. Plus, it still has fun \\"sexy\\" scenes. Loved it! Can't wait for the next one to come out! PS- I am not a big Kindle user, but didn't want to wait until the end of the month for the book to be published. Actually might be hooked on the Kindle now
B008MG1E4A|3.0|Was expecting it to be alittle better but was still very interesting non the less being an ex military I can appreciate his talent and role in the Navy Seals
B008MEM24S|5.0|This game is a great reimagining of Where's My Water with many interesting new challenges! Can't be beat for 99&cent;!
B003YO5SWY|5.0|little bit of all the bests 2 cds perfect to fill the gap in my library i love my new kindle fire hd and my experiance with the cloud
B007FG9LIE|3.0|Interesting science fiction ideas and pretty good yarn. Too James Bond like in the hero always coming out on top, seemingly just because he's the hero.
1401937268|5.0|I enjoy playing with card decks because they access what's in our subconscious minds, the not so obvious.  This deck is fun, positive, inspiring and informative.  I love the pictures on the cards, and the guidebook is easy to use.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|This is a great app that also calibrates your tablet or phone with lots of useful information.  I highly recommend it!
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Easy read. Information everyone should be aware of and not reported. Would recommend this to every one who wants the truth about how things go down. For me it was a gift of knowledge from a true Hero.
B0098VXE50|5.0|My wife and I were very pleased with this DVD the minute we saw it. I must say I was not expecting much from Kristan Stewart but I was pleasently surprised.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Despite the previous reviews,  I have had no problems with this ap.  my only complaint is having a limit on how many pins I can do at a time.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Just can't get enough...truly addictive and I don't know why...it's not like u can actually win the prizes...lol<br />Just like other ones have said...just like at the fair!!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I use this on my laptop and am delighted to have it tor my kindle.  Sometimes crashes on startupbp but I think that is due to graphic heavy Internet and not program.  I have a lot of fun with this.
0143119680|5.0|I don't usually go for vampire books but demons, the supernatural and timetravel all interest me. A friend offered to let me borrow this book back in the summer to take on vacation so I took a chance. I'm glad I did. I set my canopy up on the beach, sat down, grabbed a beer and cracked open the book not knowing what to expect. I didn't look up for two days... As a voracious reader of horror, all things paranormal, scince fiction and the author of \\"The demon dead\\" I've learned to tell a good book early into the read. This one grabbed me from the beginning. Buy it and enjoy!
B002M2T1UO|5.0|Incredible show with phenomenol actors, and a very well written script!! Addicting from begining to end!! The Shield Complete Series Collection is a must have for all true Shield fans!!  Shawn Ryan did an exceptional job putting this project together!! There is indeed a true chemistry and bond with all of the charactors in the series...Vic and his Strike Team, Dutch and Claudette, Danny and Julien!! Hooray!!!!!!!!!!!!! You will NOT be dissapointed!!! :)
B001QL5MAA|4.0|Reynolds is a phenomenal writer, and this is not an easy read. It begins \\"in medias res\\" using language that only makes sense if you stick with it. The payoff, however, is worth it. As the action unfolds in circles within circles, the logic is flawless, and the ending is satisfying enough to hook you into the next book in the series.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Ohmygosh this is like the most addictive game ever! At our high school, all the Freshmen have IPads. And Every single one of them have Flow. Amazing. Get-It-Now. Mom and Dad are already trying to steal my Kindle for it. And I Just got it today!!:D &lt;3 Flow
B0091XRRQC|4.0|I enjoy animated films and found this one very funny and entertaining. If you enjoy whimsical comedy you might enjoy this one.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love this. It's simple and I take it shopping with me so it keeps me on budget! Plies the numbers are easy to see the colors are great!
B0092SQ5EG|5.0|I liked Katy Perrys music before this. After it I lo ed it and her. This was such a fun documentary and bout her rise to fame. Its also very inspiring especially if you want to work in the industry. Definately give it a shot.
B008XG1X18|4.0|it periodically will not start up and I must force close.  I do like how easy this app is to use.
B005ZCXPP0|1.0|I dont even know where to begin.  I guess I should just get the \\"its part of the marvel universe and thus HAS to tie in to the other movies\\" disclaimer out there.  Which should surprise nobody of course but it does lend credence to the fact that the movie is a total joke.  There are so many pathetic attempts to tie in the rest of the marvel charactors.  The blue light/energy in the beginning being from Norse Gods (Thor), having Stark personally fly the plane behind enemy lines (Ironman).  Seriously?  Why would a billionaire arms dealer even have been in Italy during that scene?  Ill tell you why, retarded writing and needs to get the movie more tie ins with the rest of the stupid Avengers movies.  I guess I should admit that I am not a fan of comic books or the idea of superpowers.  HOWEVER, with a good story I will enjoy just about anything. However Captain America is NOT a clever, well written story.  Its more like a Michael Bay explosion fest for 10 year old boys.<br /><br />The movie follows Steve a little guy who wants to join the Army and fight for America. Hes been turned down a bunch of times due to all kinds of medical problems.  So naturally the scientist in charge of a trillion dollar experiment chooses him to be his main test subject.  I mean its not like the procedure was supposed to hurt and require... resilience or anything.  Oh wait a second... So Steve is now Captain America and all buffed out and becomes a celebrity and he gets put to work selling bonds and raising morale. Apparently this is a bad thing?  I guess nobody told that to President Reagan or Bob Hope who did WAY more in said capacities than they could have contributed on the front lines (unless they had a trashcan lid shield that is).  But I digress.  So Captain America decides to go in alone without any intelligence on a heavily fortified Hydra facility where his best bud is a POW and working like a slave along with a ton of other POWs.  Naturally Captain America gets in {thanks to hisgirlfriend some British chick who for some reason only works with Americans and her friend Tony (or whatever) Stark the aforementioned billionaire arms dealer and scientist who also pilots suicide missions behind enemy lines on his days off apparently}.  So Captain America gets in and beats the ONE guard watching over the POWs and sets them loose.  They rush outside into like 200 guards and of course being unarmed and the guards carrying like blue laser-RPG-machine guns the POWs just whoop the crap out of the guards and break loose. At that point I just stopped watching due to the ridiculously poor EVERYTHING in this movie.  The only character in the movie who I had found believable before I tuned out was the Colonel, played by Tommy Lee Jones.  But as decent a job as he did, he is not worth suffering through this garbage heap of a movie.  Save your time and watch one of the new Batmans if you absolutely need a superhero movie.  Or wait for Man of Steel (2013) which although a superhero movie is being produced by Christopher Nolan so there is a chance it will actually have a story meant provoke intelligent thought and not just a tie in for *Aquaman 3D or some such garbage.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|it really just gets rid of time and u get to unlock other places to like frog toss havent got that one yet
B00136JS8U|5.0|I had the cd way back in high school when it came out and played it to death. Now that i have it in my mp3 its in heavy rotation. Bottom line if your a hip hop fan gotta have this in your library.The whole album is classic . Great production rza should i say more.
B006WAIUEK|5.0|Some might say that Irvine Welsh is milking the herion thing.  Personally I enjoyed it immensly.  The characters in his books are people you have got to know over the years.  This is just another insight into their lives.  And having lived through the Thatcher years at the same age as these boys I relate to what Irvine has to say.  Just one other comment: Mr Welsh really has a thing about anal sex.  Is there one book he has written that does not contain episodes of man/woman anal sex?  Just saying likesay.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Book is fun to read! Gets a little repetitive, but who cares. You fall in love with the characters!! Can't wait to read book three!!!
B007VUA7VO|4.0|this a great app to see you battery life. I really liked it. it also lets you change the Color of the battery. that's what I really liked about it. I hope that others of you really like the app.
B004WKH4PS|4.0|I had to watch this movie for a film class and it was actually a movie that I enjoyed and was entertained by.
B007TNS6JI|4.0|fun game but hard game controls. im a wizard guy and he is way hard to control. other than that great game.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Mockingjay is one of my favorite books. Well, I like all of the Hunger Games books, but this one acutally made me mad a couple of time. It really is a good book. SPOILER ALERT for anyone that hasn't read it yet, but President Snow kills Prim and Finnick! UGH!
0345803485|1.0|This book is absolutely insulting to so many people on so many levels!  It's poorly written, very unrealistic and offensive to real S&M relationships.  How is the main character a modern day college student without an email address?  It's amazing she has any skin left the way she bites her lip every two seconds, I almost can't blame Christian for being annoyed by it.  And what's up with all the \\"my inner goddess\\" crap?  And no one has that many orgasms that quickly, especially when she calls her genitalia her \\"down there.\\"<br /><br />This is not a realist S&M relationship, real dominants and submissives have a much better balance.  Yes there are some bad people in the scene, and lopsided relationships, but this book gives them a really bad name.  Christian is a bully, not a real dom, and if Ana was my submissive, I'd kick her to the curb.  Yes, its true that a submissive submits when she wants but in the context of play time, ie the dom and sub are together for an hour, a day, whatever, and they maintain their roles during that time . . . there are so many errors in this book I'm afraid people are going to say \\"oh this S&M sounds fun\\" and find themselves in dangerous situations.<br /><br />If you actually want to learn about S&M, there are many books, fiction and non, that do a much better job.  This book is a giant piece of crap, don't waste your time or money.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I didn't think I'd like it cause I heard so much about it....oh I couldn't put it down......I enjoy the second book more than the first.....though....
B005P06AAO|5.0|I love Awkward, it is one of the best TV shows I have seen to date- and cannot wait for Season 2! :) I am Team Matty all the way, so cannot wait to see who Jenna chooses! :)<br /><br />I have to give the delivery of Awkward Season 1 a 10 out of 10. I was told it was getting made, and delivered to me and to expect 8-14 days delivery, by day 4 I had a missed delivery card on my doorstep. I couldn't ask for a more efficient service.<br /><br />So to sum up, if you want funny, heart warming and in some cases, a trip down memory lane of your youth, then Awkward is for you :)
B007SSDS24|4.0|I am a longtime science fiction fan and this was a great new idea!!  You will enjoy the inventiveness and the overall dynamics of the movie itself.
B0058YPILY|5.0|This season is fantastic, absolutely loved it. Each season just gets better & better. Loved the finale.<br /><br />A note about shipment - shipped very fast to Australia, however the padded bag was ripped and so was the CM box.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|it seems to be very accurate and informative on my kindle fire. I like the way it activates when starting or completing charge.
B0078XHAB4|4.0|As the author of [[ASIN:B008R9JOGM Annie's Guest]] I am aware of the power of the supernatural and while I may only allude to it in that book it is at the centre of this book.<br />The major problem the book is concerned with is the main character`s inability to get pregnant. Years of infertility treatment drive her and her husband apart until Eilidh seeks refuge in her home village of Glen Avich in Scotland. Unfortunately she comes across Jamie, an old childhood friend who has no partner - she left as soon as she could - but who has a delightful little girl. Jamie is still very hurt and finds any relationships with women difficult.<br />Eilidh slowly begins to heal in the old familiar surroundings and settles into a quiet rural life. She still aches to have her own child and eventually starts looking after Jamie's daughter after school until Jamie returns from work. Jamie is involved with a younger woman who loves him madly. Further complications arise when Eilidh is seriously injured in an accident.<br />The narrative is told in the first person singular in a fairly straight forward linear fashion but by different narrators: Eilidh, Jamie and Elizabeth, Jamie's mother who is alive at the beginning of the book but who dies and thereafter appears as a ghost. However, this is a romance so Elizabeth is not a frightening ghost but one who watches over Jamie, Maisie (her granddaughter) and Eilidh and tries to move events on when she can. This is where the book's title - Watch Over Me - comes from and it's a nice thought having someone watch over you.<br />This is a gentle heart-warming romance, my only criticism being I always think of Jamie as a man's name as a bit wimpish. Also I wish writers would get it into their heads that the main stop is the full stop. Here commas are used like confetti.
B009CPJHY4|4.0|A good rainy afternoon entertainment. The story itself is fair but just to watch the marvelous cast is a treat.
B00138KE5Y|5.0|A wonderful group of songs by great artists!I'm glad I purchased this in this format, it's perfectly portable.I would recommend this title in any format and this format for any title.
B007R41E8O|4.0|The download time was excessively long but once I started playing, the game was great...until halfway through, when I started using the hint button on every other screen.  It became hard to follow and did not make sense. There were many unresolved plotlines and the ending, well, both my husband and I played the game and we both said, &quot;Huh?&quot; What happened?!? Beautiful graphics, though.
B00881VLCE|5.0|this us fun. I love it and it keeps me occupied for hours on end. and its free!  I would reccommend this
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I love the complexity  of Gideon and Evas story. I loved the suspense, like the walk back from lunch with her Mom and her Mom seeing something, but you have to wait to find out that it was Nathan. What I don‘t like? Waiting until December. Less then 5 minutes and I‘m already missing Gideon and Eva! Oh, and Carey too! Bravo Sylvia!!!!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|very good game. everyday i am waiting for the coin to increase so that I can enjoy the fun. I hope there will be more similar game coming out
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Three words:  Freakin' awesome story.  It is extremely well written and the story sucks you in.  I could not put this book down even if I tried.  I got the ebook and I did not realize how long it is.  You will be reading for a while!  Awesome book about an awesome individual (although it seems he was a bit of an ass) written by an awesome author.  I have been more inspired about this book than I have even been about any other book.
B001B3MCQK|5.0|This album is one of those raw gems that you only come across every once in a while if you are lucky. Buried by time and distance; this album was a huge hit in the 70's with progressive thinking people in South Africa. I am happy that I stumbled upon this album because it is filled with uplifting rock sounds from the era that will surely not disappoint today.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Sexy and full of excitement. Be prepared to feel sad about your own love life after reading this book. Loved it!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Very fun and oddly addictive... Just like playing at arcade but without having to share with other kids or having to wait in line
B005LAJ17M|5.0|JUst when I thought writers and movies were lacking and starting to bore.  HOMELAND!.  WOW!Bravo to the talented writers.  Absolutley increadible.  I loved it.  Full of suspense and dramatic turns and suprises.  And the actings, some of the best.  I highly recommend.
B0098VYCCE|5.0|I liked it, it was a new adult twist on Snow White, plenty of action, special effects and good acting. I was happy with my rental choice.<br />[...]
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|The movie is good, don't get me wrong, but I don't see why it garnered all that hype.  I didn't read the book, but watching the movie, it was so predictable.  If you take one part chick flick, blend it with one part sci-fi, then you get a movie that doesn't work well on either level.  I found the \\"making of\\" disc more interesting than the movie.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|This is simple but fun. Cartoon like but physics seem spot on. Can be a really good time waster that doesn't require much thought.
0743243153|5.0|I was recommended to read this book. It is very interesting. I get bored with books easily. Yet this book holds my interest. It flows. Lots of eye opening,sensible things that happen in life that could be put to use in any life situation.
B007KQ6XYY|3.0|make this game free!!  there's no way that you should have to pay for this game. like they have had this for 99cents for about a year!
B005GG0MIS|5.0|This is a great book with which to learn 'inside facts' not often found in political tomes.  I like that it was non partisan and you will learn about the presidency from an unbiased point of view. The premise alone is fascinating - who does a new president turn to for advice or just a sympathetic ear?  I learned things about all the main characters that surprised me, and learned things that changed my mind about all of them.  I throughly enjoyed it
B007TML4EI|4.0|Got this game as part of the FAOD. I enjoyed it for the first few I played it on my GS III. I do not know what happened (could be an update) but it will not work on my phone anymore. When it worked though, the game was challenging. Hope this helps
B005LAIHPY|5.0|When I ordered this movie it was the cheapest I had found for blu-ray combo pack. I ordered it and it came a couple of days later. It was in the cellophane packaging and there were no scratches on either disc. I was obsessed with this movie at the theatre and could not wait for it to arrive which was prompt. Watched twice in one day. This movie was a blend of sci-fi and action which I absolutely love and to see that this movie used real Navy personnel and real Navy ships. This movie was fantastic and you can't beat Liam Neeson as an Admiral.
B002RHL8DC|3.0|This version of Stargate is by far the worst. But still watchable.<br />What makes this show watchable is the incredible CGI . Everything done on computer in this show looks amazingly real.<br />They did such a wonderful job designing the Destiny spaceship. Only if SG-1 could have had VFX like this show.<br />I really did not like most of season 1, but season 2 was much better. I think if they would have started the show like they did in season 2 that it would have gotten much better ratings and probally still be on the air.<br /><br />It really is a shame when networks cancel a show that they know is going to be left in a cliffhanger.<br /><br />The SyFy network has been cancelling just about every real Sci-Fi show these past few years . so it is getting really hard for me to get into a show on this network because I am scared that they will end up cancelling it before the show was supposed to end , then leaving us with many unanswered questions..
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I absolutely LOVED this book! I was so sad when it I finished it! Anyone can connect in someway with the Charlie's life and that is what makes it so good!

B001RTP3YQ|5.0|This CD is absolutely wonderful!  Of course is Leonard Cohen.  We'd recognize this CD to anyone looking for quality entertainment.  Also the double CDs are both quite long and provide a lot of entertainment for the money. We highly recommend this one!

B002CLBJPK|1.0|Why do they have to ruin what works? Having an option to see the deleted scenes is one thing, but to put them in so you can't watched the film without them? Just plain cruel.<br /><br />I was really looking forward to owning a good copy of this film because it's one of my favorite childhood musicals. My parents recorded it off of the Disney channel for me back in the '80s and I watched it so much that VHS is in poor poor shape now. So when I saw the DVD I thought \\"Brilliant!\\"<br /><br />...But then I watched it and was so horribly disappointed by the movie's mutilation that I couldn't even finish watching it and haven't watched it since (a couple years).<br /><br />This is one of my childhood favorites. Why don't they get that when you grow up watching something you don't want a \\"new and improved\\" version of it because the original will always be the best?! I really honestly couldn't care whether the additions were terrible or made the movie ten times more wonderful. Any change from the original is bad bad news.
B003G4W49C|5.0|There's something so compelling about books that allow us to believe people can be more, and do so much more than we typically do. What is wonderful about this one is that it does not rely solely on inborn genius; there's some of that, but you also get a sense that the greatness of the characters is built up with the efforts of many people, and a dash of circumstance. You get a group of kids, and one in particular, who form the crest of the wave of a humanity as it rolls toward strange shores. It is also a coming of age novel, which for some of us never really gets old. If you like the amazing mental skills of George Herbert's characters from the original Dune, chances are you will enjoy Card and his amazing children in Ender's Game.
B007NZDES0|5.0|You can watch it over and over and never get bored. I bought a copy for myself and as a gift for a friend.
B003H4I4JU|5.0|I wish the things in this book would become accepted practice. I don't want to spoil it, so I will be slightly non-specific. The way we deal with death effectively covers up or erases the actual person. In Card's imagination, the opposite becomes possible.
030758836X|2.0|We chose Gone Girl as our reading selection this past month in our reading group.  I just finished it and Amy reminds me of Sharon Stone's character in Basic Instinct. Nick is just as stupid in parts as Michael Douglas in that movie.  Flynn's style is unique but this book would not be on my book favorites.  It is memorable.  Nick and Amy are very sick people ... ugh.
B003Y3BBL2|4.0|I really really like Stephanie Plum series. I really really liked the Diesel books too. Luckily, I read the latter before reading Plum Spooky. The book is an introduction to the character of Diesel, but a rushed one and it is neither here not there. Just a mix between the paranormal Diesel and the FTA chasing-klutsy-funny Stephanie. However, good writing and enjoyably light fun it is.
B005JE7WKI|5.0|I avoided this movie for a while because I thought it sounded stupid.  I was so wrong!  It was hysterical and even had good acting and a decent plot to boot.  No spooks, zombies, or monsters needed.  Just college kids, hillbillies, the woods, and a tragically funny series of miscommunications and misunderstandings.  Put it on, have a drink, and get ready for 90 minutes of fun.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|This is a great movie. Our kids loved it on our family movie night and I foresee it being a family favorite. I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a good movie to watch with their kids.
030758836X|5.0|When I first began reading this book, I found it somewhat slow and put it down for about 2 weeks.  When I was assured by several people that it would be worth it, I gave it another go- and was up all night finishing it.  There are several negative to mixed reviews regarding the ending in particular, and I understand that.  If you enjoy mysteries/thrillers where everything comes to an ending that is in the best interest of justice and wraps everything up, then this book is maddening.  However, what Ms. Flynn has done with this book is nothing short of genius.  Without giving too much up, I must say that Ms. Flynn has an amazing grasp on personality and personality disorders, as well as marriage and how well two people can really know each other.  What I found intriguing was how well the main characters, Nick and Amy, actually DID know each other, right down to the ending.<br /><br />I'm thankful for the twist in the second part because the first part began to sound suspiciously like so many of the awful cases of murdered women in the past decade  What the author does in the second part is amazing and completely unexpected.  People may feel cheated by the ending, but if you take the time to think about it, it isn't surprising at all and honestly very chilling.  Like another reviewer put so eloquently- sometimes the bad ones do win...
B007GCY8FS|3.0|I really love the Jack Reacher series and was so excited to begin this new book.  For the first few chapters I was so thrilled to be reading another novel in this series.  But I became disappointed when the story began to drag about 2/3 of the way through the book.  In my thinking, it just became too complicated and the character development was lacking.  I could not relate to Jack's outrage when the FBI agent was killed, for example, because I just wasn't led to appreciate her character.  Was the story exciting and riveting most of the ride? Yes.  But compared to other novels in the series, I just missed the continuity and character development.  Still, I'm a fan and will read the next book!  By the way, I can't see Tom Cruise as Jack Reacher.  Jack is BIG and his size is part of his character's impact.  Also, Jack can be scruffy and unkempt - somehow I just don't see Cruise pulling that off.  We'll see!
B004LROUNG|3.0|A very typical Grisham trot through the legal world of big pharma. Small lawyers fight the big guys and do they win?? Read to see.<br /><br />As always, Grisham's narrator does \\"smart ass\\" humor very well.<br /><br />The Litigators was an enjoyable fast read but nothing exceptional.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|\\"A Wanted Man\\" is a good example of a Lee Child novel with Jack Reacher as the protagonyst. There is plenty of action and suspense. The writing is crisp and it is hard to put the book down.
B004LROUNG|5.0|As always with Grisham a good legal read that takes you inside the courtroom .this time into the world of mass tort .The    characters are a bit different than  the usual..
B0087HT36U|5.0|I love this game.  the whole family does. We all play together to pass the tough levels. I like this game s lot better than similar ones.

B003F3FJQO|5.0|I have completed the third book in the series.  A very good story and loved the ending. The characters were great!
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I eagerly anticipated the release of the second in the Crossfire trilogy after having read the first several months ago while searching for something to read after finishing 50 Shades. Honestly I thought the first book was better than the second although I couldn't put the second book down having started and finished it in less than two days. The back and forth highs and lows between Eva and Gideon was driving me crazy.  The final chapter brought together all the loose ends and then everything began to make sense.  I am hooked on Eva and Gideon and and anxiously await the third book.
B0040GR01M|5.0|I love this album. One of them best from 3DG. You can't go wrong. There are so many strong hits. A must for 3DG fans. If you haven't tried it......go for it!
B009AHWLHE|4.0|I'll preface this by saying that I'm not a fan of Paul W.S. Anderson's Resident Evil movies. The best thing I can say about them is that they can be pretty looking pieces of schlock, but for me, to try to enjoy them on any other level is nearly impossible, as they take themselves way too seriously. You can't do that when everything happening in your movies is completely over the top and ridiculous.<br /><br />Resident Evil Damnation, for the most part, doesn't have the problems that plague Anderson's movies. The plot in Damnation makes sense, with clear character motivations (other than Ada, who is meant to be ambiguous, as usual), good pacing, and a suitable amount of action, particularly towards the excellent climax. The monsters are well done, too, with the Lickers in particular being well represented. They are suitably slimy, scary and ferocious as ever. The CG also seems to be a step up from the previous CG Resident Evil movie, Degeneration. Leon's character model in Damnation, in particular, is a clear improvement from the always scowling Leon from Degeneration.<br /><br />As a side note, I've always regarded Leon as being the most relatable character in the franchise alongside Claire Redfield. Leon's constant streak of bad luck in both the games and movies, and his ceaseless optimism and ability to maintain a sense of humor despite this, makes you want to root for him. To compare, Alice from the live action Resident Evil movies is a completely soulless cipher, a leather-clad Barbie doll designed to shoot the bad guys. This is not to say that Leon is an amazing character or anything, but he's the best we've got, in my opinion. I wouldn't mind if they rebooted the live action movies with him as the central protagonist of the series.<br /><br />So, what are Damnation's shortcomings? I could have probably done without JD. Seems like you can't have a horror story without a wacky comic relief character anymore. It's too bad, because there's a fairly competent, dramatic story going on here, and JD drags it down a bit. If JD were more, I dunno, SUBTLE, I think I would have liked him more. He sort of redeems himself as a character during his final scenes, though, I will give him that. It goes to show you how smart this movie is that it can mine a goofy comic relief character for a bit of good drama.<br /><br />Some of the dialogue in this movie was also a bit ham-fisted. One scene in particular sees Leon surviving a Licker's talons thanks to a flask that he keeps hidden away in his vest. After the Licker is disposed of, Leon APOLOGIZES TO HIS FLASK. I'm not kidding. He actually looks mournfully at his flask and apologizes for not being able to save it from the Licker's talons. I know this was supposed to be a shot at humor, but I couldn't help but feel that this is the kind of cheesy stuff that I'd see in one of the live action movies. Also, Leon's monologue to Buddy at the end sounds awkward and forced. There are other examples, but these were the ones that stuck out in my mind while writing this.<br /><br />My only other real criticism is the weak antagonist. She's not terrible by any means, just under-developed. It almost feels like they ran out of money while making this thing and had to cut some of her scenes. It's too bad, I enjoyed her, especially her fight with Ada. Good choreography work there.<br /><br />So, to end, I really liked Damnation. The flaws that haunt Resident Evil stories don't seem to be going away any time soon, but in this case, the good far outweighs the bad. Hopefully we can get another one of these CG movies in the next few years. They're pretty decent, this one being better than the last.
B008JTTUDW|5.0|I enjoy this record start to finish. Opens strong with \\"45\\" and ends with a couple of charming covers of Nirvana and Tom Petty. The covers make a lot of sense when you hear the record in it's entirety. His writing has branched out a lot tonally and compositionally. There is definately a 90's influence. Producer Brendan O'Brian, did a great job of taking the tones of the instruments to the next level without subtracting any life. He really got an amazing vocal performance out of Fallon. That's about all I can say as a reviewer without telling you what you're hearing. Decide for yourself.
B008G12ERC|4.0|Alternative rock band Muse return with their follow up to 2009's [[ASIN:B002GZQYMK The Resistance]] with 2012's [[ASIN:B008G12ERC The 2nd Law]].  On the thirteen song set, members Matthew Bellamy, Dominic Howard, and Chris Wolstenholme oscillate between a variety of musical styles.  This makes The 2nd Law captivating, but also makes it disjointed and lacking in cohesiveness.  Where the progressive stylings of The Resistance seemed to lay with ease, the dubstep experiments on this effort don't always calculate to overwhelming triumph.<br /><br />\\"Supremacy\\" opens epically, characterized by a lovely harmonic progression, superb songwriting, and magnificent orchestra orchestrations. The song allows for plenty of instrumental space with a small amount of lyrics. Bellamy's falsetto is incredibly noteworthy here while overall the frontman delivers a capable vocal showing.  The chorus is a highlight: \\"You don't have long/I am on to you/The time, it has come to destroy/your supremacy.\\"<br /><br />\\"Madness,\\" the promo single is quite a contrast to \\"The Uprising\\" from 2009's The Resistance. Gimmicky and characterized by dubstep wobble bass, it does show the band's willingness to experiment, which is a pro.  The initial bare bones production eventually expands adding harmonized backing vocals and more instruments, showing good pacing.  A guitar solo is a high point.<br /><br />On \\"Panic Station,\\" the funk-rock groove contrasts the dubstep infusion of first single \\"Madness.\\" The chorus is well penned, though it might be Bellamy's casual f-bomb that stands out the most on the second verse.  \\"Prelude\\" follows in dramatic orchestral fashion, preceding the show-stopping \\"Survival,\\" which features a vocal groove not so far removed from Laurie Anderson's \\"O Superman.\\" From the first note, one feels that \\"Survival\\" is vintage, top-notch Muse.  The guitars are dirty and more than indicative of prog-rock.  At the end, the lyrics \\"Fight!\\" and \\"Win!\\" are treated in epic fashion, capping off the album's best track.<br /><br />\\"Follow Me\\" has a hard act to follow, but it is up to the tall task. Coupling low strings, neutral synths, and dubstep, \\"Follow Me\\" is experimental, but lives up to its ambitions.  \\"Animals\\" loses little to no steam, opting against a concrete chorus in favor of a chorus based on similar theme, not necessarily the same lyrics.  \\"Explorers\\" is stronger, opening in a major key and contrasting the minor key of \\"Animals.\\" The strings are superb here and Bellamy's vocals are quite nuanced and compelling. The key change that occurs upon the last iteration of the chorus is a bit underwhelming, but that is only a minor quibble.<br /><br />\\"Big Freeze\\" sports a quicker tempo than \\"Explorers\\" and possesses a gospel/blues sensibility.  The first portion of the verses tend to underwhelm, but the latter portions and the chorus are quite exciting. \\"Save Me\\"  and \\"Liquid State\\" are the last notable vocal cuts.  Both are solid, but no exceptional and seem a shade less enthralling than Muse's best.  \\"The 2nd Law: Unsustainable\\" and \\"The 2nd Law: Isolated System\\" close the album, comparable to The Resistance's closing symphony \\"Exogenesis.\\" The problem is that the dubstep explorations and lack of any notable `latching point' make the closing cuts feel like `a waste.'<br /><br />Overall, [[ASIN:B008G12ERC The 2nd Law]] is by no means Muse's best album. There are some exceptional high points but also some overambitious and experimental lower ones. Save for \\"The 2nd Law\\" cuts at the end, nothing is downright a `miss.' Perhaps next time though Muse should avoid trying to assimilate so much to modern pop trends and gimmicks.ff the album's best track.<br /><br />\\"Follow Me\\" has a hard act to follow, but it is up to the tall task.

B003KIMOIK|4.0|Two of my favorite actors, Clint Eastwood and Burt Reynolds, come together in a hilarious gangster flick.  Although the plot was predictable, the tongue in cheek lines were calculated to catch me off guard for an entertaining experience.  Great for a Saturday afternoon matinee.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|Stunning work of imagination providing more biological  information than most may want - stuff to look at,  smell, and  munch on.  Yet,  through the specifics in the Pacific,  we are plunged and lifted,  stripped and encrusted,  transformed into someone/something so seemingly \\"other\\"  it's hard to believe  the  result has been pulled from the \\"truth of me,\\" the worse and best, all needing  to be embraced if to be  fully alive.  Where is the truth?  In the painful story?  In the  \\"can't be true\\" facts?  In the \\"incredibly cruel, awful events\\"?  Or is the truth our capacity to no longer \\"live in denial,\\"  take the \\"mud and spit of earth\\"  and real life to \\"heal our blindness\\" and fearlessly believe \\"the truth is what sets us free.\\"  Pi, a name echoing infinite multiples, a  given capacity  accessed, it seems,  only by those who,  with open hands,  have lost or let go, surrendered,  everything.  In return everything, and more,  has been poured back.  Dare we peel back the culture's veneer of needing nothing,  no one?  Dare we show desire,  seeking, essentials?  Dare we destroy what prevents us being what we were created and called to be?  Dare we be naked to the purifying heat of the sun,  listen to the silence,  look into the darkness and wait?  All too often we dissemble, smile,  tell the stories  the world,  out of fear or only capable of hearing. If we have been privileged to  encounter and experience the radically transforming One,  then we have been made stewards of that experience..  Such is the invitation of the Life of Pi.

B000I9VON0|3.0|For the most part, \\"Sneakers\\" is an entertaining movie. If you really want to enjoy, you must first get yourself in the mindset of a 15 year old boy. While the acting is fine for most of the movie, there are some scenes that should have been re-shot for less-than-perfect performances (I've seen MUCH better performances by Poitier). Other than sub-par acting, some of the action scenes are VERY unbelieveable (but 15 year old boys will buy them).<br />Redford, as always, does a great job in this movie, and it's good to look back and see River Phoenix in one of his way-too-short-career performances.<br />If you haven't seen her in earlier days, Mary McDonnell provides some great \\"feel good\\" for the eyes!

0307592731|1.0|Cheryl Strayed makes remarkably bad decisions one after another throughout this book. She describes herself as \\"indignant\\" when  someone suggests that she tries a backpacking day trip before she embarks on a 1,000+ mile hike, she doesn't know how to use some of her vital equipment and relies on the generosity of strangers to teach her once she is already on the trail. She is unhappy with how her family falls apart after her mothers death, but makes no indication that she has considered how the death has affected any of them; she is so wrapped up in her own self pity and pain that she appears incapable of being a comforting presence to anyone else and frankly, I wouldn't have wanted to get together with her either. If you want to hear someone whining about their personal baggage, or you want to be amazed that someone very unprepared could survive this hiking trip then you might like this book. I recommend reading an excerpt before you buy.
B003YL4LYI|2.0|George Martin lost his mojo in writing book five of the fire and ice series.  while the first couple of books were refreshing and a cut above the average fantasy adventure, this book has Martin sinking into what constitutes a soap opera, with different characters and their stories being drawn out for the sake of a series, and at the cost of the integrity of the story.  It is a sad and disappointing decline.

Layken learns that you not only grieve the dead but also the living and that sometimes it is through the dying that we are made to live.<br /><br />Its a story about learning and loving and learning to love and that letting go of love is sometimes the strongest love of all.  Its about learning that even though letting go of said love is the best way to set it free, that its ok to grab a net and take it back.<br /><br />Its about saying what you need to say even though you may not know if it should be said cause someone else may need to hear it.And how sometimes the loudest sound is silence. Damn that was a good book.
B009329ZF2|2.0|Lots of action, not all that much plot. Most of the story line gets lost within what action sequences that take up the majority of the film. Originality is definitely lost in the beginning of the movie where an actual youtube video of a guy breaking into a store is \\"remade\\" into comedic relief for this flick. I couldn't believe it. Shot for shot, frame for frame. I hope the criminal who suffered through the original robbery actually got some money put on his books for it. Or perhaps the convenience store that first posted the video got some sort of royalty. I highly doubt it. This movie is also considerably inaccurate about shipboard situations and how sailors actually react in the Navy. But then, It's a movie. You only need 3 people and a couple extras to simulate a ship run by hundreds of people on a daily basis in a movie. Right?

Save your money and buy the CD or high quality digital download, no advantage for the SACD.<br /><br />I do love the music - one of my favorite albums - I am refering to the SACD recording only.
B0095R64AO|1.0|This movie is way to long...the story drags on and on it could have be done in half the time! It's a really really really really bad flick that's the bottom line!!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I was totally absorved by the history, I couldn' t wait to be ready to read it. It has been one week since I finished book three but I am still thinkimg of Christian Grey and Anastacia. I wish my husband read it and tried to be 5  per cent of what Christian is to Anastacia! Just loved the books.
B004DNWPY4|5.0|This book has been so helpful for me. It made me see how important it is to really pay attention to where my money goes. I have actually changed my spending habits because of this book.
0767821769|5.0|i have always loved this movie and now i own a copy. the cast works so well together.my term tear jerker is for movies that are happy and sad i'm sure people out there will understand this.
B001UG6Z84|5.0|I have enjoyed all of the Supernatural Series. Some I like better than others, but I recommened seeing all of them.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Love it. After a hard day you just want something easy. Reminds me of some of the games at the fair when I was a kid.
B003EYVXTQ|5.0|Winter's Bone is one of my absolute favorite films.  I was so excited to see it was available on Blu-ray and the film translated incredibly on screen.  The Special features are very impressive as well.  The \\"Making of Winter's Bone\\" option on the menu takes you to seemingly raw behind the scenes footage of filming Winter's Bone.  You can see camera crews, overhear the \\"off-screen\\" conversations between the actors and crew, and get a good feel of the true atmosphere that was on set.  I love this Blu-ray DVD and would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of Jennifer Lawrence's work  and/or good storytelling.
B000MXJ7LS|4.0|World Trade Center movie brought the viewer inside the twin towers during the dramatic part when the first tower went down.  The screams and horrors were enough to make want to run away from the TV screen.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Enjoy the convenience of tablet reading. Amazon is a great way to have a book at your easiest reach. Thanks for this service.
B008QTUA5W|5.0|It's THAT good.  Seriously.  I was home sick for a few days and flew through the entire season in a few nights and over the weekend. If you have any feeling that you might like this, just get it.  You won't be sorry!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is great! Its so addictive too. The more you play, the better it gets. Make the other coin dozer games soon!!!!!! I'm looking forward to them!
B005ZO6NRA|1.0|I just kept fast forwarding. Good special effects. I don't think I ever want to see another movie ever again.
B002VH7P4O|5.0|Are there audible *differences* compared to the remastered CD's? Yes. Does 24-bit lossless FLAC sound *better* than the stereo CD's ripped to WMA lossless? I say yes, although headphones are recommended to hear the improvement. The USB plug is held in place magnetically, and I had no trouble pulling it out by the stem.<br /><br />- Logitech Squeezebox Touch, analog output<br />- Harman Kardon HK-3390 receiver<br />- AKG K240 Studio headphones<br /><br />Update: 20 Oct 2013 - The Beatles Apple USB drive has failed. Having made multiple copies of it the day it arrived from Amazon, I hadn't plugged it in for months. Today I thought I'd give it a try, and \\"USB Device Not Recognized\\" is what comes up when Windows attempts to load the driver. This happens with Windows 7 and XP, on all four of the systems where previously the drive had worked fine. I know a lot about troubleshooting this sort of problem, and I don't need suggestions on how to try making it work. At the moment the plug seems to have simply gone bad somehow, while sitting in its box.
0316228532|5.0|I loved this book.<br />I don't know if I've ever had a book that made me laugh as much, and I certainly haven't had one that brought be to tears as often. This wonderful book about the factions that develop in a small town, a few people who decide to run for an open seat, and the emotions that their families feel about them. There was such great character development, as the different residents of Pagford and it's surrounding areas come into contact with one another in surprising ways.<br /><br />Maybe it's just because it's an election year in the US, but I saw lots of points on the great conversation about personal responsibility and taking care of those who need help. While it's easy to see which side Rowling comes down on, you also see that it's not a easy topic, it's complex and throughout the book you see many people's views on it.<br /><br />Also, the nerd in me loves that SQL injections played a large role in a book about a small town in the English countryside.
B0051UP5NQ|1.0|You ask for every permission that android has practically, yet you explain 0 of them from what I can see. now here's an application that invites me to convey my private thoughts and my personal communications and data and run them through your application yet you seem to think so little of your users that we cant get (and don't deserve?) an explanation of what permissions you want/need? So basically, we should just shut up and be grateful to have some sort of 8-bit level \\"office suite\\" on our mobile devices and not say anything even though it is obvious that you could care less about our right to secure our privacy, huh? Most of the permissions you're asking for can be abused and can be misused in major ways. Thus, your lack of explaining them speaks volumes about you as a company. Even free would be too much of a price to pay for an application like this, much less a pretty ridiculous 15 dollars. I did become a licensed user when it was the free app of the day a long time ago but it is only gotten worse since then and I will no longer use it, even for free. and when free is still too expensive, I don't know what to tell people that are actually thinking of buying this thing. You guys need either clean up your act or explain WHY you want every permission under the sun for a basic \\"office suite\\". Thank you.
0525953728|5.0|Normally I don't read non fiction books but jumped out there and bought this book. It is a easy book to read. It moves quickly into the story of a seal starting out through the ranks and human trials he goes through to keep up. Many people should be able to relate to this story. Highly recommend it to all.
B007UXSPK2|3.0|If you like action, Ghost Protocol is OK. Unfortuantely, Amazon doesn't have many streaming titles. So you're kind of stuck with this. I used to have a Blockbuster a few blocks away from me. The key is \\"used to\\". That's why I watched Ghost Protocol
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I have enjoyed reading Fifty Shades of Grey, Book 1 and I am starting book 2.  I think the book is dark but kind of erotic.  I am very interested to see what happens between Ana and Christian. I am hoping she can break through his dark side and come out on top.
B009FOBMBI|4.0|Firstly, I want to say I have been a huge TDG fan since One X. I didn't really enjoy their first album that much other than a few songs, but I really didn't listen to it much until after their best album (One X) came out. I thought compared to 5/5 One X that Life Starts Now was a great, solid, melodic rock album maybe 4/5 on the scale. It had some great songs equaling even Animal I Have Become or Riot.<br /><br />However, here we arrive at Transit of Venus and I am not sure what happened. TDG came right out and said this would be a \\"(something) that will never happen again in your lifetime, reflecting both this uncommon occurrence as well as the mood\\" much like the astrological occurrence of a transit of Venus. Let me just say THANK GOD.<br /><br />This album isn't horrific like Linkin Park's latest works, but still doesn't have the kind of edge we all have come to know and love from this band. It isn't exactly mediocre but yet lacks substance in melody and meaning in half the songs. On initial listen, only the single 'Chalk Outline' and 'Broken Glass' really popped out at me and screamed TDG. 'Operate' is instantaneously annoying, and 'Time That Remains' first twenty seconds are poor, but becomes one of the playable radio-friendly songs despite sounding slightly off-key at times.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this album is filled with a few single songs I might buy again. Being a huge TDG fan, I have the album, but there will be some skipping playing through this album after a few times I am sure.<br /><br />3.5/5 for being not great, or awful, but still far less than what I have come to expect for TDG from the previous 2 albums.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love this app soo much!!!! I play this game all the time!!! It is really addicting and its a classic arcade game!
B006HTUZ1C|3.0|I think I'd like this game much more if it worked a little better. You're supposed to be able to tap the screen to rotate the dropping numbers but it doesn't always respond so I have to tap the screen 3 or 4 times to get it to rotate. In lower levels this is a minor annoyance, but as the game gets faster it is a game ender.<br />- Galaxy SIII
B007MG360G|5.0|Thank goodness for this game! It's fun, and you can choose whether you want to play it the hard way, or if you want to fly through it! Simple, but addicting! Always loved these games and always will!
B003KK65KG|4.0|Another great read by Jodi Picoult<br />I really enjoyed this book even though at times it was heavy going,its a sad wakeup to the pressures of society. Chidren trying to fit in and dealing with 'not', parents doing what they think is right and dealing with their wrongs.
B0086700CM|3.0|u gain points way way way way way slower than on apple products...thats the biggest problem...it needs to be fixed ASAP
B004I744AS|5.0|Before finding this dictionary  it was very hard for me to understand some of the words from the books  I read. Now with this app it's so easy. I love it.! And the best of all. It's free. Who says you can't find informative and entertaining? You have all in just one app.
B007URVZJ6|4.0|I found the information helpful for submitting my first manuscript.  The guidelines for formatting and page setup assisted me in getting the document converted and up on the site for sale.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book was awesome! Some people said the second book was worse than the first....im telling u it wasn't... it was a fantastic book! couldn't put it down!
B006OCM0G0|1.0|MY KID BLEW $5000 ON THIS APP NOW WE LIVE IN A CRAMPED HOTELL ROOM AND I WAS FORCED TO TAKE A JOB AS A STRIPPER DONT GET THIS APP
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|All of the books in the series are good but i find this one my favorite  because it is mysterious
B00846TRHY|4.0|This movie based on Sam Childers jump around aa little but it had to cover many years in just a few hours. I found it engaging that someone could throw away so much for a idea and a mission. It was very gritty and hit home on the high and low points of the character.
0765316994|1.0|I wish the author really had writer's block. Then he wouldn't have written this dog's breakfast. The idea might have made an amusing short story. As a novel, it was just painful. The codas were embarrasing. Scalzi can do a lot better.
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|THIS GAME IS AWESOME. THE STORY IS AMAZING AND THE GAME IS AMAZINGLY FUN!<br />RADIANT IS 5 STARS AND WORTH 2.00!!!
B002BI6SMI|2.0|An action movie for sure, but it's just too over the top to really enjoy. Perhaps if Liam wore a super hero costume... then we could buy all the leaps. Glad I rented it and did not waste $20 at the theater watching it.
B003Z0BWR2|5.0|this was a great book, i really enjoyed reading it, it was a great follow up to the first book and now im reading the 3rd and enjoying it as well..
B009D0LBRO|5.0|The game can be overly simple at times but the sound anv visuals are the best you'll find anywhere.  I thought it was angreat deal.
0525478817|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. It's believable and a quick read. I was quite upset when the book ended just because I hated that being the last I'd know of both Hazel and Augustus. You will not regret getting/reading this book
145470246X|4.0|As a multimedia artist who has enjoyed beading for quite a long time, Sabine Lippert's Beaded Fantasies is well worth the purchase. It's an easy to read guide to making some very beautiful jewelry or to provide a base for modification to one's own taste.
B0098VXE50|1.0|Amazon purchase review: If you enjoy unmitigated gore with no redeeming art, this is the film for you. The real Snow White should arm her seven short buddies with automatic weapons and take no prisoners.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|fun for everyone! this game is very addicting and I cant get enough of it! I stay up late playing this game
B003WJQ74E|5.0|Saw the movie (\\"Charlie\\") years ago, and finally read the book.  All the feeling, joy, sorrow, happiness and frustration that was in the movie, jumped out at me from page after page.  Read this book, you will be amazed at the human spirit!
B0055L5M4S|2.0|The adhesive on this does not work very well and some of the led's on the strip didn't work at all.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I got this for my daughter so she would stop badgering me while I played on my  laptop. It's also become quite a handy reward and distraction on trips. And, I can pretend that it helps with her spacial awareness and problem solving skills, which it actually does some. Between this and Judy Moody she has more incentive for learning to read well too.<br /><br />There are a few bugs, apparently if you try to put a door on snow you end up replicating the door.
B0087JTAKW|3.0|This was well written but definitely not his best. maybe his worst.  the story was very predictable and didn't blow you away like his others. there really wasn't a big twist or turn. fairly disappointed.
B0071BGOJC|5.0|Ken Follett has masterfully woven this intrigue into a can't put down, thoughly enjoyable, portrayal of our recent history. Please hurry with the 3rd in this fantastic trilogy
B0087HT36U|4.0|I like it. Not necessarily challenging, but awesome chain reactions. Watch out for the peasants. Hitting them costs 15,000 points.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Just awesome doesn't need any other words. Reading book three now. Again awesome. This series is def worth reading. Hated when I had to stop because of work or sleep.
B000FC2L1Y|5.0|Claire and Jamie meet the New World.  This book is terrific.  Characters are very well constructed, and Gabaldon's style of weaving in classic quotes is always well enjoyed.  I love the Outlander series.
0062209493|2.0|Purchased audio.  Did not get used to narrator voice.  The subject matter is very interesting to me so I was disappointed.
B007TMON8M|5.0|Great game -- very fun and challenging -- really makes you think -- a really cool casual game.  If you like this, the same developer also makes one called \\"Dummy Defense\\" that's also very cool.
B004GJDQT8|3.0|I'm not sure if my new tablet linked a pre-loaded Amazon Mobile app to my account when I set it up or, if I used Amazon to load an app on the device. I see in my account that I bought the free app. Since I am asked to review it, I will. For now, I'm just neutral. But amused.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I was sorry that I had to pay for these 3 books, Shades of grey, Deeper and Freed. I thought that the story got staled certin times thought out the story. Some of the sceans are hot but for me I got tired of the cry baby. That seemed to be the story line.
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|Very cute movie.  Funny plot and story line, hiding the great pyramid under a sky colored tarp...hilarious.  I guess even super villans need a nemesis when no super heros are around.
B009329Y30|5.0|A heartwarming story with a wonderful theme.  The opening scene of the boat going along the river, with the voice in the background, sets the stage for what is to come. The young Marine is the lucky one. It is my kind of movie, filled with romance, with the good guy winning out in the end. Blythe Danner was excellent. I love this movie and have already watched it twice.
B007FEFLTO|1.0|I'm only about half way through the book.  It's a good read.  My problem is with the Kindle Edition.  Missing pages!!!  Seems to happen when a new chapter begins.  Very frustrating and discouraging.  I don't actually purchase Kindle editions very often as I am fortunate to have a library system that has many Kindle options for borrowing.  However, I was so excited to read this second book in the trilogy, I bought it as soon as it came out.  I'm going to contact Amazon/Kindle directly and see if I can't get a refund on my purchase, good luck with that, but am writing this review now to warn others.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book evoked a multitude of emotions in me. I felt great empathy for the characters I got to know very well. As a parent and new grandparent, I identified with the struggles facing the parents of this amazing child.  I think the book highlighted the dangers of bullying as well as the power of courage and love. A definite read.  I look forward to more by this author.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|i was a skeptic at first .. using colornote, or a piece of paper.. or whatever, works until you have more than 20 or 30 notes.
B0085TKAW6|5.0|Ken Folletts books always come alive, the characters are complex requiring a lot of concentration to follow but you feel like you know them personally and are sad when the book ends.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|I'm tired of Ana and Christians sexcapades. I did enjoy some of the books. I did read all three, but the books lacked depth. Good for diversion.
B004SOR4H6|4.0|this app is great. The best way to.tweet on a Kindle Fire without a doubt. I do wish it was a little more tablet friendly.
B0075PZ2ZG|5.0|It took me a little while to get used to all the screaming (I started out with Nightmare), but I grew to really love it. Now some of my favorite songs are on this CD!
B005IQZB14|5.0|I won't be hiking the PCT any time soon, but I have to say this is an amazing story. Cry, laugh out loud and wonder how anybody could tackle this alone and without lots of training.  But , the author did, and the telling truly is a story of redemption. Read it!  You'll be glad you did!
B004UNX1LS|1.0|will not show videos of any brand of music i wasted my time downloading this garbage i wish i could give it 0 starts. do not download this it is a wast of space and time
B00976N384|5.0|I wanted to give this record several listens before rating it because The Killers' records tend to hold gems I don't hear with the first few listens.  Being from Las Vegas I fell in love with it right away. I love Nevada and Las Vegas as much as they do apparently but I worried that maybe people who don't know Las Vegas or don't care for the desert might not be able to relate to the lyrics. After more than 5 listens I am no longer worried about that but if you love Nevada and Las Vegas the album will hold special meaning to you and will hit a place in your heart saved special for Las Vegas and Nevada.  Battle Born is my favorite song right now.  Nevada has been through some hard times (as has the whole country) in the last few years and I feel like that song is for the people of Nevada and also for the spirit of the state itself. IDK if that's who or what Flowers wrote the lyrics for it's just what I get from it.  Sam's Town is still my favorite Killers album but this one is a very close second.
B008HK3XOU|5.0|This case is just fine.  I bought the orange colour and it is great.  I also refused to spend so much money on the Amazon product. Depending on how you put in the Kindle, you can charge it without taking it out.  I really do not see the big deal with turning the instrument on and off.  Please note that the case has mostly the smooth material.  I was concerned about that before the purchase.  If you want something different you can got to ETSY.com and type in kindle case cover and see some interesting, affordable covers that are made, with nice designs.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|I love this series. \\"Wanted Man\\" did not disappoint me. It is a good read. I can't wait for another Reacher novel.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|So this game has become addictive to me yet it took about 15 minutes to actually become fun so glad it is free and am glad I got this app
0756655307|4.0|We have the most recent version, and are so impressed by the huge amount of content included.  It even has full color illustrations for each entry.  There are 391 pages of heroes, villains, the civilians who are important to them, how their stories intertwine, and special sections dedicated to important Marvel time periods and events.  This is a great book to have if you enjoy Marvel comics.
B0053O89IS|1.0|With nine less episodes in this season I would would have expected it to be priced accordingly. Does Amazon have any say in how items are priced? You couldn't go to bat for Bones fans and say this was priced way too high? I will not be purchasing for awhile.... I will wait for the price to come down to where it actually matches what you are getting.
B004RZGUBM|5.0|The transcription to electronic form seems very accurate. The original illustrations are nice, very clear. An incredible value. If you have not read Charles Dickens then give it a try. These are not stuffy boring classics. These are thrilling, scary, funny, page turners.
B0092MKFIY|5.0|Excellent CD. I listen to the entire CD straight through at least 2 times a day. Really enjoy \\" it's time\\" and \\" on top of the world\\"
B0051UP5NQ|2.0|I only used this for power point and it is very limited.  The only editing features are resize, rotate or delete.  I could not create autoshapes, but it does allow photos to be imported from the device.  Text boxes can be added, but they cannot be formatted.  The app closed my presentation several times while I was working on it, but it did attempt to restore my corrections.
B006KX3GXO|4.0|I like it but you cant really edit the colors of like hair and stuff like you can on the GIMP photoshop. I wish this type of thing could be added bht besides that I love it! :D
B0098VYCCE|4.0|The movie was entertaining. The visuals were gorgeous but it should of had better plot. All in all I liked the cast and the make believe.
B007KZY1YY|1.0|It became a little boring after reading sex scene after sex scene with basically the same descriptions.<br />A small amount of fiction weaved its way into the book, but basically I found myself skipping some of the sex descriptions looking for a bit of the story line.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this game is a perfect game if u get bored. the bad part is if ur outta money u gotta wait to get some more but other than that I rate it 5
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I was really surprised with the amount of games the app had. I would recommend this game to all my friends!!!!!
B007GCY8FS|3.0|This is certainly not Lee Child's best.  I have thoroughly enjoyed the Jack Reacher series, but this is average at best.  It is worth reading, but don't have high expectations for it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The stress and fear engendered kept me on the edge of my seat. Waiting in anticipation for the next step in this never ending game of malicious depravity.
B005ZUR724|5.0|This is a good game..Graphics are awesome.. Huge world to explore..Multi player nonlinear game... new content updates regularly.. Worth 7 bucks.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This was very entertaining. Challenging yet easy enough with the hints if you're really stuck. I can't wait for the next installment.
B002SF9YNO|5.0|Beautiful and sensitive treatment of a unique custom that is neither widely known nor widely used in Japan.<br />The sudden and devastating loss of a coveted job led Mr. Kobayashi to accept work he never would otherwise have dreamed of.  At times comical, and at other times heartrending, but at all times enlightening and respectful, this film is worth sharing among friends and family.
B0091574VI|3.0|Interesting and entertaining little flick. Tim Allen unfortunately ruined it for me. Otherwise I recommend for anyone who is a nature guru.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Not a had game. Just like the games on FB, but not on it. I recommend it. It has good challenges that are achievable after days of play. Requires time away to allow for accomplishments to be achieved.
B003BWERF8|5.0|Purchased to be compatible with Big Jambox.  Meets all my expectations.  Vendor delivered prompt service.  Using with Classic Ipod.  Either white or black to match your device.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Nuff said. Works great and plays great. Gives options for random deals or winning deals. Lets you finish or auto complete at the end of the game.
1401322786|5.0|I really enjoyed this read, like i have Mitch Alboms other books; \\" Tuesdays with Morrie\\" and \\" The Five People you meet in Heaven.\\"  I decided to pick this one up as well, I had no idea that it was reflective of my life's current situation.  The teenage girl resembles my mother and the older man my father, to a certain extent.  I have been trying to help them both out to understand how precious our time is here on this earth and with each other.  The fable does hit on this area to give us a relative view on how the time we have here is special and it can be wonderful if we strive to enjoy every moment.  This just makes me appreciate the days I have with my four children and wife at home and how much I will miss them when the time comes for them to  move on as adults.  I am blessed and grateful for my life, wife and kids.....this just makes me ponder and appreciate that even more.  You too will enjoy.
B0091REZMW|2.0|works ok on kindle fire.  kind of small picture. make it a little difficult. to see. but still fun. wish the. pictures. were bigger.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I love this game it is even better than the Mario game yay I love the leprochun best ohvyeah but :) thisbgamebmay love me innkeeper winning hay me!
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This is one of the best games I have ever played! Will definately buy the next one. Great graphics and played great on my kindle.
0545128285|1.0|Firstly, one should not expect something substantial in size, like one the 7 main volumes of the series.  Instead, expect a slim volume like her earlier \\"profits-to-charity\\" efforts, like Quiddich Through the Ages, or Fantastic Beasts and Where To Find Them.<br /><br />But even with those expectations, it hugely disappoints.<br /><br />The 5 brief Tales presented here are simply not good stories.  When they try to be positive, they lack all conviction.  Only when Rowling drifts into sheer horror (\\"The Warlock's Hairy Heart\\") does she manage to be memorable.  Still, there is nothing moral about that story's moral (laboriously explained in the introduction).  She is merely wreaking perverse and pointless vengeance on passive heroines, like those of Sleeping Beauty and Cinderella.<br /><br />The commentary by Albus Dumbledore (and by Rowling in her own name), only seems to make things worse.  By laboriously explaining the stories' virtues, Rowling only underlines how poor they are.  Meanwhile, Rowling's attempts at playful inventiveness fall flat, as though her heart were no longer in it.  Behind it all lurks a stench of preachiness, and behind that a deeper stench of cynicism.  It is though she has decided to take herself seriously, and her Muse resigned in protest.
B004DI7HZ6|3.0|The characters don't have much depth and the story is slow. There multiple vampire cliches but then, all vampire novels have them. Just enough interesing content to read, but I won't read it again.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Loved it. E. L. James nailed it. The book was easy to read and a wonderful love story. I have read the entire ser three times.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|very additive bought it for my greatgrand daughter and got hooked myself. good strategy game really makes you think. recommend it for children and adults
B005OCHOZS|5.0|Scott takes us on a fantastic journey. He allowed us to see very personal parts about his life and laid them out there for us to either critique or connect with. Look I am 236 pounds and I am training for my 5th marathon. I won't be a Scott Jurek. But when someone shares their joys, successes, losses and pain with you, it is hard to not connect at some level. I can't relate to the speed and endurance of this man. I can just be in awe. But the emotions and feelings and the affects childhood has on our adulthood...yeah, I get that. It's worth a read. It is not only inspiring and encouraging but it is full of advice as well. Peace.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|At 1.99, it's a steal!!! I would have paid 20.99! You won't be able to put it down!! This and HP, the only books I have read more than once!
B0050DIWFC|4.0|[[ASIN:B0050DIWFC Defending Jacob: A Novel]]  Cutting edge science fiction which may become reality in the forensic world is how I would explain the compelling drama in which this family is embroiled. A father is a district attorney in this town when a child is found murdered. In the course of the investigation it becomes apparent that his child knows the victim and as the plot develops, Jacob is charged with the murder.What happens during the course of the investigation and trial changes the family's standing in this close knit community and threatens to tear the family apart. Mysteries are generally fun for me and easy to figure out, however this novel was an exception as I was constantly reevaluating the evidence almost to the end. The murder and the profile of the killer is so chilling that you'll be looking over your shoulder for a long time and wondering is this is the next \\"fingerprint\\" of a murderer we will see in our courtrooms.
1609611543|5.0|I was already eating a low-carb diet, however, \\"food quality\\" was not on my radar, yet.  This book helped me transition from eating processed foods to eating a low-carb, primal-type diet (100% whole, natural foods, meats, and cheeses).<br /><br />The biggest benefit of cutting out the grains, and other processed foods for me was how EASY it was for me to give up smoking and using artificial sweeteners.  I definitely think the breads and pasta, etc, affects your addictive centers in you brain because it was never so easy to quit smoking for me and I have not had an urge to smoke at all since I quit almost a year ago.<br /><br />I used to hate to be in the kitchen, now, I absolutely love to make my own food from scratch.  I also honestly believe my cooking tastes better than anything I could get eating out (sushi and melting pot chocolate fondue on special occasions, aside).<br /><br />Try it for 30 days, it'll change your life.

B009CPJHY4|5.0|Just an Amazing movie, so touching, it really describes India and their beautiful people who lives there, the story plot and the actors are 5 starts and even more
B0053O89JM|5.0|I have been a big fan of this unconventional character of Dr. HOuse and liked the ending which fit with all that had been going on. Was a little disappointed in the lack of continuity leading up to the ending. More thought could have been put into that part.
B00351YEVC|4.0|This book is written from the viewpoint of the boy, so the reader feels protected from the unfolding events of word war two.<br />It is incredibly thought provoking, and a good book to introduce children from about the age of twelve years to the topic of the second world war.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|Brilliantly written mystery love-story. Full of surprises, it starts as one story, changes its tone, then changes it again. Written through the eys of both the wife and husband, we begin to wonder who the guilty party really is? It is very hard to put down this book, not only for its suspenseful plot-line but for Gillian Flynn's poetry of words. She also manages to tap into some brilliant home truths about relationships and gender battles. The only thing that bothered me with this page-turning thriller of twisty shocks, was the disappointing fizzle of an end. Nontheless, fabulous read and I would definitely read more of Flynn's work.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|I wish I could write this review as eloquently as this author wove this tale.  This is a story of an unassuming, timid man finding healing through a brave, unlikely adventure. It is an honor to walk with this man through his awakening of heart and spirit.  This book is funny, welcoming and nurturing. This is worth your time and will leave you admiring the resiliency of the human spirit and the courage of one man who didn't see himself as very courageous at all. Read the sample and you'll buy the book.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I really love this calculator. It's very good for doing school work. I love the plain colour, that makes it seem like a real calculator. I also love the fact that you can view your history of your math problems!! Overall a great app. Defiently a must have on Kindle Fire.

B0012NVGHU|5.0|I learned of this film after hearing about the Broadway show of the same name, which garnered a lot of attention at this year's Tony awards. Reading the various reviews posted here on Amazon is like reliving the iPhone-vs.-Android battle: people seem to be fiercely loyal to the music from either this film or the Broadway cast.  Personally, I think they're both great. The film is romantic and simple. Two people are falling in love, and the music not only seasons the story; it advances it. The songs are deceptively simple but work under your skin, and the entire soundtrack is beautiful and heartfelt. The story is one we've perhaps heard before, but told well. The two stars of the film also wrote and perform the music. The male lead was involved with and gave his blessing to the Broadway show...if he is happy with it, that's good enough for me. I'll likely never get the opportunity to see this show on Broadway, but I'm thrilled to have seen the film, which I'll doubtless watch again and again.<br /><br />By the way, what a cool feature with Amazon...when I purchased this DVD I got a free 'ticket' to watch the film immediately on Amazon Prime streaming!  I watched the film on my computer the same night I ordered the DVD, so when it came in the mail I already knew how much I loved it.
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|This is a very well written story that follows a senior citizen on an unprepared-for pilgrimage.  It is wonderful to follow Harold's character development and his personality \\"bloom\\".  The plot bogged down a bit just past the middle, and the interesting characters he met along the way were not expanded enough.  Their effect on Harold and their part in his \\"becoming an interesting and less shallow character\\" is usually quite evident.  The ending is a bit contrived but probably inevitable, given the circumstances of the story.  A very good read.
0316228532|5.0|I wasn't entirely sure what kind of book I was buying when I picked up Casual Vacancy. The buzz on it had been vague. I heard that it was a mystery, and then that it was about teenagers, and of course that it was \\"for adults.\\"<br /><br />What it is, is literary. It's a story about ordinary people going about their everyday lives, and its insights are subtle, falling within a very narrow band midway between the evil of Voldemort and the virtue of Harry and his crowd. It's the kind of book that, say, Jonathan Franzen writes--and I think a much, much better one.<br /><br />Yes, the characters are selfish, narcissistic, self-absorbed, and often malicious toward one another--in other words, realistic. They also don't have their lives very much under control. They act out of petty personal motives while telling themselves that they're serving significant causes like helping the disadvantaged and keeping people healthy, educating the children and keeping the community clean and safe. It's pretty hard to like or respect them--and yet I did, simply because they're so realistic. They're like us, and we're all we've got.<br /><br />So I kept hoping things would work out for them, and that they'd be a little happier at the end of the book. Alas, they're not (Did I mention that it's realistic?). But they haven't given up, none of them, and a few of them might be better people going forward. This is literary fiction, and it's very, very well done.<br /><br />And I'm glad to be waiting for J. K. Rowling's next book again.
0553284347|5.0|At the age of 60, I finally understand so many of my behaviors that didn't make sense.  At the age of 60, I know myself better than I had ever dreamed.  At the age of 60, I understand why I felt like I did for decades, why I could never please my parents or siblings no matter how hard I tried.  And most important, at the age of 60, I am happy.  Truly, absolutely happy.  I never knew these things till I read this book.  I had an amazing 'AHA' moment in Chapter 12 - Who Is Really Responsible.  I realized someone did everything they could to belittle me, make me responsible for things I could not understand beginning at the age of 4.  As I read that chapter, I felt the weight lifting off my shoulders, I FELT FREE.  Reading this book, learning from this book, and now living the life this book has helped me achieve has been an amazing experience.  I can't even put into words how much my life has changed in the last few months.  I feel wonderful.  I feel like the 'me' I was meant to be.
B001QB9H10|4.0|Since the first of the Transporter series came out I became a fan of Jason Statham's movies.  I have loved seeing all his action packed movies.  I will have to say that I enjoyed the first two Transporter series better than this one; nevertheless, this one has plenty of the same fighting and driving action that fans of the transporter series has come to expect.  Like all the transporter series, Frank Martin shows his incredible skill in fighting multiple attackers and always seems to finish the fights without even breathing hard.<br /><br />This one had an extra challenge for Frank Martin with a metal bracelet explosive device that is set to go off if he strays 75 feet from the car he is driving.  Natalya Rudakova shares the ride, who also has the same type of metal explosive bracelet on her wrist.<br /><br />In conclusion, if you are a Jason Statham Transporter series fan, you will enjoy seeing this movie.<br /><br />Rating:  4 Stars.

B005GSZZ1A|4.0|This book is extremely disturbing.  There are acts of torture; physically, mentally and emotionally that will bring you to the brink of tears.  The level of abuse these people suffer under the thumb of the North Korean government is appalling.<br /><br />This story covers the life of Shin Dong-hyuk which was born in a North Korean labour  camp.  The author gives you insight into the camp itself, the ideology of prison life and the penalties of violating the rules.  Shin witnesses and indirectly participates in the hanging of his mother and execution of his brother for attempting an escape from the camp.  He is then tortured himself within an inch of his life due to their attempted escape.  Finally meeting up with \\"Uncle\\", an old man imprisoned with knowledge of the outside world and enough medical knowledge to nurse Shin back to \\"normal\\".<br /><br />** SPOILER **<br /><br />Shin in befriended by a 40 year old political prisoner from Pyongyang, Park, which has firsthand knowledge of the outside world and himself escaped to China with his family, only to have himself and family imprisoned when he returns to North Korea to vote. They spend many hours discussing the outside world.  Ironically, the allure of freedom was not as appealing to Shin as was the promise of meals.  They plan an escape and Park loses his life while attempting to escape, however Shin is the benefactor of Park's death and uses it to his advantage.  This brave man, without any knowledge of geography, no concept of money, no connections, no help was able to make it out of the camp and make his way through freezing temperatures and hostility out of North Korea and into China.<br /><br />The book also covers the \\"adjustment\\" period of Shin once he makes it to freedom.  I was impressed with the \\"Unification\\" program of South Korea to assist the North Koreans.  They house, feed, provide medical and dental care and even take the North Koreans on field trips where they take them shopping and have them interact with South Koreans.<br /><br />The saddest part about this story is that although he escaped physically, it is painfully obvious that emotionally, he is still a prisoner because of the irreversible damage caused by his up-bring and travels heretofore.ract with South Koreans.<br /><br />The saddest part about this story is that although he escaped physically, it is painfully obvious that emotionally, he is still a prisoner because of the irreversible damage caused by his up-bring and travels heretofore.
B004WGIXX4|5.0|I loved this movie! Funny and exciting. At first I thought it was all about sex but then it turned out to be a really nice/complex love story.
0525953728|5.0|The book was interesting from the start. It starts with the rappelling from the helicopter that didn't happen.  It was the major emergency as it began. It gave a brief overview of the syllabus to get to his level of performance giving the reader an understanding of their team concept. It then tells how situation changed from minute to minute to place \\"Mark\\" in position to shoot UBL. The book then takes you to the departure from UBL compound and what happened afterward. (At this point, helicopter pilots will be speculating on the cause of the incident. My guess is, either LTE or setterling with power)(It's really futil to try to fix a cause with so little evidence).<br /><br />As a person who hates to read and will not read fiction (novels), it was hard to put this book down to eat and go to bed. (Yes, Kay, I'm still a very slow reader)<br /><br />\\"Mark Owen\\" was careful not to divulge sensitive information. Unfortunately, either politicians or the media learned his real name and quickly published it. Was that to deliberately put him and his family in danger? Could it be both? It was a childish, contemptible act either way.<br /><br />I bought my hard bound book at Amazon.  It was delivered quickly, I read it slowly.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|This second book of the Century Trilogy by Follett is a wonderful read. It was a pleasure to turn pages and find well structured grafs, well crafted characters, well represented historical events ... all toned and easy on the reader. I didn't want the book to end.
B0017P7MOO|5.0|I was introduced to Elbow by the iTunes music festival, and raced to Amazon to buy. I have been unable to stop listening to this perfect album for weeks now. Stirring, sad, lilting, funny, wry and even coarse. Just stunning. Luxurious, unique compositions, a vocalist with a terrific range and a hint of Peter Gabriel. This is like so much of the music I love yet completely unique to Elbow. Highly recommended for fans of Peter Gabriel, it bites, Marillon, bill Nelson.

B0085MNZ66|5.0|I've really enjoyed playing this game on my kindle ...it's really addictive...I'm in the higher levels where you criss cross color paths and need to add or remove a color to get to the correct colored destination. Its has very basic appearance but doesn't affect the enjoyment of the challenge. I'm looking forward to more games from this developer.

B001OGWY1W|2.0|The plot in Dark Knight Rises is dark for the sake of being dark and the plot is dragged along kicking and screaming against logic and credibility (and if you know anything about science, shut your mind down before watching, Nolan didn't bring in any technical consultants when  writing the script and at least one of the devices here will make your head hurt if your brain is engaged when the exposition comes out).<br /><br />If you love the BatMan character, see it if you feel you must.<br />If you Really love the BatMan character, Dont.<br /><br />Take a pass on this one and re-watch the Dark Knight instead and pretend the series ended there (Heath Ledger is Fantastic as Joker). Nolan didn't want to make this third installment and it shows in that the script has no polish whatsoever.<br /><br />**** SPOILER ALERT Past this line ****<br /><br />Most of the critical scenes are absurdly contrived and pointlessly complex.<br /><br />a) Cat burgler steals Bruce Wayne's full set of fingerprints from a safe (and breaks into it for good measure). MUCH easer to get them from a beer bottle or can from the trash (he's a recluse with precious few people in the house to muddy the water).<br />And, strangely, having prints from a beer bottle allows one access to billions in assets.... you know..... because that's how Hollywood stock markets roll with their security.<br /><br />b) The Stock market is invaded in a military attack to insert a program to run bogus trades. Whouldn't it be ALOT EASIER to just bribe a broker to enter the program (which, apparently, involves plugging in a laptop and, hitting the enter key).<br />They literally stormed the stock market in broad daylight (automatic weapons, hostages, chase scenes, etc) just to plug in a laptop and hit the enter key.<br /><br />c) Attacking a CIA plane with a military cargo plane while in flight employing cables, a highly choreographed paramilitary acrobatic team and an inside man wearing a mask (which is never removed by his captors). This scene is ripped out of Stallone's film - Cliffhanger bye the way (and poorly adapted). If you had a month to prepare this flying circus, couldn't you just place a few sharpshooters around the Remote airstrip, shoot the agents before they took off, take the guy you came for, leave the mandatory corpse and then burn the evidence after the fact? Just saying.. 20 or 30 bullets is alot cheaper than the rental on a C-130.<br /><br />d) Fusion reactors are NOT fusion bombs as much as Hollywood wishes they were. Can they explode? .... Yes. On a vast scale? .... Not one that fits in a truck). The Joker said it himself - chemicals are cheap - just build a big bomb.<br />Or, if you must be cataclysmic, MUCH easier to use a bunch of Dirty bombs (uranium Oxide \\"cake\\") that can be obtained in any number of unstable, easily bribed countries. Or buy a nuke off the black market in Eastern Europe. Mr. Nolan would know about these or a Hundred other plausible plot devices if he bothered to Ask someone like..... a TECHNICAL CONSULTANT. (Seriously, $200 million plus budget. Hire someone to do some basic homework.)<br /><br />e) How can a police force that can render a major city nearly \\"crime free\\" and yet be clueles to an army of insurgents.... Are we supposed to believe that these shaved chimps cleaned up crime That effectively without lacing up the old Hob-Nailed Boots to do so?<br /><br />f) Etcetera (and don't get me Started about a helicopter with the blades on the bottom and the top covered over).<br /><br />But All this can be forgiven if the charactors are well written and engaging.<br /><br />They aren't.<br /><br />Bruce/Batman is a self-destructive, self-loathing cripple<br />(Alfred concurs with the first two, his doctor confirms the third - in case someone in the audience failed to notice the painful limp).<br /><br />Bane can't hammer a nail without orchestating a raid on Home Depot first.<br />(And none of the employees would understand him when he demanded directions to the<br />hardware section without the aid of a cheesy voiceover.)<br /><br />Both, yes Both of the female leads betray Bruce (Nolan Really has some issues there)<br /><br />There is No main character that one can admire, root for, care about.... keep your eyes open to watch while you're figuring out which artery to cut to make it all go away.<br /><br />Morgan Freeman is excellent as always but he can't hold this wrist-slasher together by himself.<br /><br />Michael Caine is excellent and I actually apprecied his advice when he prophetically walked away from this story because it was too pointlessly depressing.<br /><br />(Can't say Nolay didn't warn his audience.)

B005LAIHY0|1.0|I promise you, I was entirely excited for this movie when the previews blared all over the theater screens and TV spots.  Yet what it delivered was an unenjoyable, stupid, absolutely frustrating waste of film.  There is no \\"thought provoking\\" mystery to the whole thing, it's just a badly written movie that does NOT deserve to be owned, let alone be a part of the wonderful, honestly well made Alien films.<br /><br />Answers, there are none.  Questions?  You'll have plenty, and not about \\"why are we here?\\" more along the lines of \\"Why go through all the trouble?\\"<br /><br />Rent the movie, perhaps, but be prepared for a disappointing, blah film.
B000000ITC|5.0|\\"Tales of Mystery & Imagination\\" remains (for me) my favorite Alan Parsons Project album. Unfortunately when it came to regular CD back in the 1990's Parsons was \\"inspired\\" to remix the album, add keyboards and other overdubs (including Orson Welles' narration). If you like the changes made the first CD regular release of this album sounds fine as well. The MoFi does not have these changes and represents how the album was originally released.<br /><br />This release has a lovely sounding, wide dynamic range and a perfectly creamy analog sound to the mastering job done here.<br /><br />While this is an expensive option for fans of this album it is well worth it. The Mofi remaster IS the best version of the original album (if you don't mind the overdubs the regular CD is probably the best version--the two disc deluxe version is OK for both in a pinch but, having said that, they don't sound the best as that release is close to brick walled)<br /><br />We get the original artwork in the booklet. There aren't (as usual with Mofi releases) any bonus tracks.<br /><br />It's a pity this version is out of print because it bests every version (of the original release) out there (well, I can't speak to the vinyl version on 20th Century records the original LP release as I haven't heard it years).<br /><br />Highly recommended.

B0083SBM7Q|2.0|The movie The Avengers is a grand, fun superhero romp with great blockbuster action and lots of quiet jokes that make for a fantastic experience. I've seen it three times now, and it was just as fun the third time as the first.<br /><br />As for this particular product, I bought the DVD/Blu-ray combo pack because it was supposed to contain the deleted scenes and other extras. I don't have a Blu-ray player, but I paid -extra- for these features which are at least implied to be on the DVD. It turns out they are only on the Blu-ray.<br /><br />I can't fathom why they are punishing me for not having a Blu-ray player, but I shall get my money's worth yet -- by giving the Blu-ray disk to someone who does.

0525953728|4.0|Summary is best said in the Navy Seal Philosophy: the only easy day was yesterday.<br /><br />Besides the insight to a key event in US history, it brought forth leadership traits, where needed most: life or death situation.  Although written by one member, it is not a book of an individual, but a book about the requirements of an organization to train, plan and execute in the face of unknown.<br /><br />Work Life Balance does make for a rounded individual, but the 110% dedication to a goal greater than oneself, is admirable.  These men who train as SEALs, and the ultimate SEALs who were chosen for the mission are a different breed.  But, tying into the Mindset, they were not born as experts in what they do, but continuously train beyond normal citizens' endurance<br /><br />\\"The point was not to meet the minimums, but crush them.  Success in Green Team was about managing stress and performing at your peak level-all the time.\\"<br /><br />They trained for all possible outcomes.  The sign of a leader was one, who had the skills, put the needs of his men before himself, and took action where required, no matter the circumstances.<br /><br />\\"One of the key lessons learned early on in a SEAL's career was the ability to be comfortable being uncomfortable.\\"<br /><br />And, another tie into the Mindset, relates to planning and the need for constant evaluation.  What was successful yesterday, will not always succeed today, much less tomorrow.  The environment around us is continuously evolving.  Success is won by the team that has varied perspectives, open lines of communication, and pushes its members forward.<br /><br />\\"Take some time and really get into the weeds.  We tried never to fall in love with a plan, because that breeds complacency\\"
B000002TQV|5.0|Although I think Pablo Honey is underrated, The Bends makes it very clear that the first major rock band since U2 has arrived.  They deserve that accolade because they can't easily be compared to anyone else and the songs are uniformly terrific.  It's incredible that this album wasn't that commercially successful at first because it didn't have a hit single.  (Here's something to consider: The White Album didn't have a hit single either).  But time catches up.  Nothing this good stays a secret, and this still remains my favorite Radiohead album.  Hard to pick favorites but High and Dry, Fake Plastic Trees, and Bullet Proof are instant classics.  Don't be cheap though, download the whole album.
030758836X|5.0|GONE GIRL is one of those books that you cannot put down.  I read it in 36 hours, practically non-stop.<br />The story is so absorbing; as you are reading you wonder how the author could even have come up with the premise.  As soon as you think you know what will happen next,  another twist appears, one that shocks and amazes you.<br />Buy it; read it and share the book with your friends.  You will need someone to discuss this with when you're done.
B0011HF6GE|4.0|I have a \\"five listen rule\\".  I have to listen to any new album at least five times before passing judgment.  That served me well here as For Emma took some time to get under my skin.  But it did.  This is a very atmospheric album.  Although it's mostly acoustic, it would be inaccurate to call it Folk.  More in the vein of Damien Rice.<br />Few individual songs would stand alone as classics (the title track being an exception) but this is a clear case of the whole being greater than the sum of its parts.<br />If you have eclectic musical taste and you like having quieter music to play on a Sunday morning, then don't hesitate to get this.  If you only listen to commercial top 40 stuff, you should probably stay away.

B009ARMP7U|5.0|I have always loved Glee, and this gave me know doubt that this season would be one of my favorites!!!(:
B008XG1X18|2.0|Not what I was expecting. Way over hyped. App doesn't work half the time and will crash when I can get it to work.
B00466HM28|5.0|I'm new to recording and making beats so I wanted to start off small. With the akai mpk mini it does everything I need. I use it with Reason 5 and with this I don't need anything else
B001V5CIHQ|5.0|My granddaughter who will be 4 and I watched it on Encore Demand TV a few weeks ago 6 times in 2 days. She loves Peter Pan and the boy who plays him. No longer on Demand so I decided to buy her own DVD and now we can watch it whenever she is here. Pop Pop isn't too happy but we have fun together and never grow tired of it.
B006ID6NDQ|5.0|A very interesting book that kept my husband and I up later than we should have been many nights until we finished it.
B005SAY404|5.0|House didn't disappoint good season opener. I would def give it five stars. Good drama with a new atmosphere provides a good change from the hospital
B0072OFM28|4.0|Despite the loss of star Andy Whitfield, the show still turned out better than I expected.  While it's not as great as Blood and Sand and Gods of the Arena, it was still entertaining and one of my favorite shows on TV.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I really got inspired by this book and Men who make this country safe for the rest of us. It depicts true reality of a SEAL life and depicts the sacrifices these man make!
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Not much to say except, here's another top notch novel by the master of thrillers and mystery.  GO LEE!  I  have never  gotten tired of reading his books.
B00976MZYM|5.0|I love the CD. All songs sound great. She has a voice that is beyond talented. Nice song contents. Better than many in the gender. She is neat and versatile and is not slutty.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I hesitated to buy this book because I thought it might be some ghost writer trying to capitalize on an opportunity that undoubtedly would capture buyers' interest.  I'm happy to report that my suspicions were unfounded.  A great page-turner that I highly recommend to both book fiends and casual readers.  No Easy Day is thrilling, insightful, and enlightening.
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|took about a day but I played it a lot. pretty entertaining- didn't want to put it down I recommend it
B0090EIILU|2.0|but was really let down.  I did not laugh at all during this entire movie.  He should have stopped at Borat
B007SYWFRM|5.0|it isn't to hard and never ending get this game.it's addicting it is hard to stop playing it is fast to download.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|As usual, another great read from Lee! Reacher finds the trouble and wins.<br />Now its off to Virginia to meet the voice on the phone. I think Reacher will encounter Lester Lester Lester again along the way, We'll see!<br /> One more thing BOYCOTT THE MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Great book, you get romance, adventure, and then some all in one. I literally had difficultly putting it down. I'm reading the entire series and would definitely recommend to all my friends.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Reads like a novel but you know it is a true account.  A real page turner and worth the read.
B0087HT36U|5.0|super fun through the rocks die soledgers die pierets die cowboys die tices die cave men through the fire and slime
B000F1IQN2|4.0|Why is there no Blu-Ray of this yet?  This is a very good movie and deserves it.  The drama is intense (particularly with those ominous drums from the John Williams Score), and the themes concerning violence and revenge come through very well.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Reacher does it again. He manages to solve a vexing national problem while being wanted by everyone.  Child's imagination wins us over again and again.  A first rate story that you will not figure out until the very end.  Only Reacher can do that!
0812993292|5.0|How many of us stop growing after middle age? We find a formula that works and we stick with it, missing opportunities to experience joyous awakening? Maybe we start saying things like, \\"I'm too old to do X any more.\\" And we shut down, close off. We fail to notice the continuing wonder and miracle of life.<br /><br />In this story, a couple in their 60s have made their peace, of sorts, following a horrific event in middle age. They live together, married in name only, settling for having another person in proximity (to take out the trash. To do the laundry. She snaps at him, he looks away.) The author conveys emotion so skillfully, not overwriting by one syllable.<br /><br />Then, something happens, and the husband, Harold, begins a journey both mental and actual - he sets off on a walk from the south of Great Britain to a point 500 miles north. I won't tell you if he makes it or what happens, but I will say that the story was so good, I put it in a class with Gilead by Marilynne Robinson. This author, Rachel Joyce, has achieved this miracle: she describes the sweetness and difficulty of life in such a way that you can't separate the two, and are a better person for having realized this fact.<br /><br />Many thanks to Ms. Joyce for this winner.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|It basically has the same storyline from Twilight. I thought it was gonna be an original but not worth even reading it.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|This is another hit by Ken Follett.  Once you finish page one, you can't stop.  This is chocolate for the mind. If the reader is retired, that is good thing because you can catch up on your sleep instead of worrying about falling asleep on the job.  As you move through the novel Mr. Follett writing technique ties book one immediately into book two. I am so looking forward to book three.  One great thing is that now these two books brought out by Amazon are archived in my Kindle and ready to be re-read with the touch of a button.
B0098VYCCE|1.0|Therons' worst movie.  The rest aren't nearly as good.  I kept waiting for something cool to happen.  I'm still waiting.  Avoid this one.
B002PEP4SC|5.0|I really enjoy how reading these books after watching Castle on tV brings you back to the beginning and how it all started.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This is a fun way to spend a little time relaxing and killing time. Only minor thinking is required to send the coins into the chute.
B0064MGU98|5.0|I missed this series when it first aired. I have been doing some needlework and chose this series to watch, blessedly commercial free, while I stitched. I loved learning about the ecology of a law firm and about the lives of lawyers, the personal cost of being in that profession.
0525953728|5.0|I enjoyed reading the firsthand account of the mission that eliminated Osama Bin laden. The author did a very good job of explaining what was happening in a way that i could understand.
B007HGPBRC|5.0|An incredible read, very moving but so sad.I purchased this for my Kindle/iphone and could not put it down until finished. We unfortunately lost a great Writer far too soon.
B0087HT36U|4.0|Definatly worth the $ .99. Basicly Angy birds but with better aiming<br /> very addictive, just wish it were longer. can't wait for the follow ups
B000PMLFRA|1.0|It is very simple, George. You first released \\"Star Wars\\" in 1977. That release made you a billion dollars then and later for \\"The Empire Strikes Back\\" and \\"Return of the Jedi\\". Perhaps you loathe them now. Perhaps you wake up late at night, screaming incoherently, drenched in sweat, and tortured over the hell you created 35 years ago. Well, too bad. Suck it up. You are a billionaire thanks to moviegoers that saw your movies between 1977 and 1983, NOT 1997, 2004, and 2011. I am going to be the one to say it: You OWE US the original theatrical versions. Why? Because those are the ones that gave you your fortune, that we fell in love with growing up. The ones we paid for in 1977, 1980, and 1983. So yes, George, you imbecile, you owe us THOSE versions. Anything else is a stab in the back and an insult to every moviegoer that made you a billionaire. Period. Over and out.
B003SI84D6|5.0|I so love this movie, it is so well formulated with those who star in it as well as the story line. It's the best of the best in my opinion.
B002BWQ6H6|5.0|This excellent novel weaves together diverse characters in unusual ways.  Set in NYC in the 70's, we learn about life among prostitutes and saints in South Bronx, grief in a Central Park penthouse, a judge's decision, wreckage and death, the salvage of dignity, and how all these lives wind together like a tightrope.
B0086700CM|4.0|the game is edgy, fast, and simply thrilling. graphics of a game are account for my first immpressions, and they are just great! For me (kindle fire)  it never has lagged once, never failed to download, etc. so I don't quite understand why people are having issues with that. the only complaint I have is that as you progress further into the game it does get rather difficult. and with having to start over at the very beginning... well this doesn't tick me off but I can see how it may be for others. also accounts for why people say its repetitive.<br />nevertheless, an excellent well-rounded game. I highly reccommend that you watch some gameplay or try a free trial.<br /><br />-NikoFoxe
B004QZ9PLU|4.0|Another good story from Nicholas Sparks.  This one had me guessing which ending would it be because he had a few different scenarios that could be played out.  I am looking forward to the discussion we will have in our book club.
B0083Z614S|5.0|I first read this book when  I was 10 or 11 and recently reread it age 67-believe it or not! I was truly enchanted when I read it as a child because it was so relevant to me at that age. I  related to many of the emotions of the young people in the story and remember being moved, for the first time, by a piece of literature. I reread it because it was mentioned in a contemporary fiction book i recently read. To use a trite phrase it \\"blew me away\\" the second time. The writing is wonderful and the observations about children, emotions and personal growth are very authentic. I'd recommend it to people of all ages -it is a wonderful book!
0345803493|4.0|the book took a while to get here I thought it would be faster<br />compared to the other 2 volumes the paper and cover of # 1 and # 3 were nicer.  this one seemd like a copy.  but that didn´t imply any problem in reading it.<br />thank you
B00846REIS|5.0|There were similarities to Fifty Shades but this series story is much deeper than Fifty. Love the vast personalities! Not liking waiting until December for book #3.
B008B1VYP0|4.0|I really love Maroon 5. I love the songs on this album usually you might have 3 good songs on a album but that is not the case with this album. I was not disappointed.
B00881VLCE|2.0|At first was very pleased &amp; workinh well.  Just recently has proved to be a lousy app, with the loss of puzzles I had acquired &amp; not being able to get them back or now being unable to keep what I redoenload.
B0002IVN9W|5.0|It is undoubtedly superfluous that I write this positive review as so many have already done so, but I particularly want to mark the longevity of Arcade Fire's music especially in regard to my personal life. During my sophomore year of high school I had my first real relationship and first experience with Arcade Fire simultaneously. Granted I will admit I learned about Arcade Fire from a \\"lame\\" source aka my favorite TV show of the time Six Feet Under, but I rushed out and bought the album in November of it's initial release year, 2004.  I loved the combination of French and English and felt like they and the New Pornographers had stumbled onto something magical with the bilingualism. Additionally, I bought and supported Neon Bible because I loved the vibe of this band so much. It saddened me that they never received appropriate accolades for the above, but when The Suburbs, surprisingly I will not lie, won the Best Album Grammy I was overjoyed. This is still an album I will listen to from beginning to end no matter the time that has passed. Buy it, rent it from your library, stream it on youtube, but please listen to this album to understand how amazing Arcade Fire can be.
B005USZML4|5.0|I loved all the Theo Boone books, I was looking forward to another one. A good read for all ages.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|I thought this was a good read, kept me interested and not a ton of characters. Easy to follow and kept you guessing for a while.  I enjoy reading the Jack Reacher series, like having the same main character to follow but you don't have to start with the first book, Mr Child explains things so that it is a reminder if you have read his other Reacher books in the series but gives you enough info that if you hadn't you wouldn't be lost.
B008I34ZFW|4.0|I ordered this movie blind and did not know what to expect.  Turns out to be a fun campy B movie.  The films never takes its self too seriously and results in a lot of fun.  I can see it becoming a cult classic.
B008ANFRGQ|3.0|I would rate this album as a rock record. It is not the fantastic type world of \\"Passion and Warfare\\". But it is of its own world and includes the listener in this different type of world.
0316017922|3.0|Like Gladwell's other books, much-hyped and doesn't deliver on the hype. Most obnoxious to the intelligent reader is Gladwell's underlying theme that people can't create their own destiny or accomplishments, that it is primarily reliant on accidents of birth or birthdate.
B001SZ2Y4G|5.0|I had only heard of this movie once before I got into my Business Innovations class for my MBA and this film (along with Tucker: A Man and his Dream) were two optional pieces of work.  I was VERY glad I'd selected the optional films for some make-up work as they were fantastic accounts of what it means to see more than meets the eye in business.  Hudsucker Proxy is a wonderful film that follows a clever and enthusaistic, albeit oblivious, business school graduate as he finds himself in charge of one of the most profitable companies in the world.  The ever optimistic main character, Norville Barnes, does not know when to quit even when things get bad but his inability to see his own limitations makes him one of those most successful tycoons in the business world.  This is a light-hearted film with top notch acting and is kid friendly to boot (though some of the material may go over a child's head).  I added another movie to my list of favorites after seeing this film and I'd recommend it to anyone I know.
B008X77K8W|5.0|I discovered Chris Knight on Pandora. All it took was House and 90 Acres and I was an instant fan. This new effort by Chris is dare I say a masterpiece. How many artists can do that this long into their career? All of the tracks are great, but Out Of This Hole stands out for me as a work of art.
B003R0MF1W|5.0|Love Patric Jane.  To follow him as he is able to read clues and people is interesting and so much fun.  The relationship between him and the rest of the CBI crew is a perfect blend of professionalism and quirkiness.  Each of the characters have their own special personality.  The acting and writing for the Mentalist is creative, believable and fun.
B008RC72G8|3.0|This movie was ok to watch, Johnny has been better in most of his other movies though. I would imagine it is harder to bring a tv character to the big screen and make it a great performance. If anyone could do it I really thought it would have been done by Tim Burton and Johnny Depp teaming up.<br /> I was surprised by the lack of extras on the disk. Most other movies especially comedies have out takes at least.
B0071BGOJC|3.0|Fall of giants was an extraordinary book.  I fell in love with it instantly. Reading through the second one, I felt bored and had to struggle to complete it.
B006BGZJJ4|4.0|I like this cable but You have to pay for the other plug head before it is useful and it costs 20.00. So with this cable that means 30.00 for the whole set. The first one I had broke at the neck and I am very gentle with these products. Because it didn't last long enough I gave it a 4 otherwise good product
B0058VW36U|1.0|i really love this game and ive played before but it tells me an error accurs everytime i try to install it so ive spent money on a game i vant even play!!!!!! waste of moneg
B007LB2B3K|4.0|this is my second Volbeat album.  It is very good.  At first I was a bit disappointed since, to my ear, it didn't measure up to Guitar Gangsters & Cadillac Blood.  But after a few listens I love it.  Heaven Nor Hell & 16 Dollars are a couple of the best songs.  This album now gets almost as much playtime as Guitar Gangsters & I would suggest that anyone who has any interest in Volbeat should listen to it.
B000SEFCD8|5.0|I really like her teaching method. And it works!!!<br />  I was at my cabin last week and opened the door to let my two dogs out when they met a strange dog who had wondered up and off they went into a full chase :(. I called out to come....no acknowledgement .  Then I lowered my voice and said \\"Nooo\\" stopped dead in their tracts. Then I said come! Come! Come!  Yay it worked.  Great book,
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I love this app its great for not being late for school:) ajdnits FREE so go get the app!!!! I recommend this for kinds of all ages from 7-when your a adult!!!!!!!
B000NQRE1E|5.0|Excellent movie. I enjoyed the way the movies shows the differences between the rich and poor.<br />Sad but true. Not sure why it took so long for this movie to come out on DVD.
B006O6EOII|5.0|The roller skate wheels move. The helmet can be easily taken off and put back on. Great details, fun skates that can also be removed with ease. Knee guards are a darling touch. Great hair color detail and her makeup is very nice. SUPER quality and details for one of the more inexpensive Monster High lines. LOVE THEM ALL.
B008220DIC|5.0|This film is as dense as a film could possibly be. The 65mm photography is only overshadowed by the existential questions posed and the mind-blowing performances by Joaquin Phoenix and Philip Seymour Hoffman. A lot of people were confused by the ending, so i'll provide a hint: where is Freddie shipped when he leaves Doris? China. Keep that in mind when the master and Freddie meet for their final scene together.
B007STBUIW|5.0|Very well done, I enjoyed the classic like it was new again.  I'm not a fan of the ultraviolet option, but otherwise a must.
B0070ZLZ1G|4.0|The book is an interesting, easy read.  It is a good reminder that the definition of success is personal and centers around happiness in accomplishing realistic goals.  All parents with dedication and enterprise may give the gift of success with the elements discussed in this book.  Not only is it a great gift for children but applies to many areas of life.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this app. has such great ideas... so much fun.I love it.  can pin and read later.  great. !!!!!!!!!!!
B00973DDN2|2.0|i was waiting very patiently for this album.  when they released the first track, \\"runaways\\", it kind of gave me the feeling that they were heading back to the good old days of hot fuss and sam's town.  i have been disappointed with most of their work since those two albums, and unfortunately the trend is continuing with battle born.  i only liked the title track and runaways.  the other stuff is getting way off their base.  i'm sure a lot of die-hard fans will appreciate it, and i've been listening to them since the first album, but i don't think the average listener will really enjoy this album.  if you don't own any killers albums, start with the first two and see how it goes for you.
B006RXQ8RI|5.0|This is by far my favorite movie, Uma Thurman's performance was spectacular and the soundtrack was great. This is Tarantino at his directorial best.
B0031RS2HC|4.0|Lee Child's writing never disappoints.  I felt that Jack Reacher's persona seemed less developed in this book, than in some previous ones, but still, quite good.  I would give it 5 stars but I don't care for the grizzly stuff.  Something awful is of course required in a Jack Reacher novel, and I do like them very much, but can't quite give it a 5 compared to some other things I like to read.
B00270WH3Y|5.0|S&G can never run out of style. Great melody with beautiful lyrics and lovely guitar chords. Takes you back down the memory lane.
B008I34ZFW|1.0|I should have read Rotten Tomatoes before renting this thing.  It received a 37%, and frankly that was generous. It started off as a very rarely funny but sometimes tolerably amusing satire.  You needed to suspend disbelief regarding the science and put on your \\"accept-o-matic\\" goggles regarding the second class special effects.  The last half grew increasingly stridently preachy, which made the film gradually sour its taste for me.  The essential theme in the second half was, \\"see you Americans are no better than the Nazis.\\"  I have no doubt that we Americans, like all humans, share a nasty core, but the smug self-congratulatory neutrality offered by the Finnish director/writer got pretty tedious. Frankly, with the penultimate cynical statement about human nature still inscribed on my retinas, if I could have given it negative stars, I would have.  Don't waste money on this silly tripe.  Wait until it is available someplace for free.  I offer no disclaimers about the time in your life you will have wasted.
0525953728|5.0|I found the book to be very good, it was well written and enjoyable, I found it hard to put down and was not dry as so many books of this type tend to be.
