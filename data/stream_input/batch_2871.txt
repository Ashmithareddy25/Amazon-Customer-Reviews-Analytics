B008133MDK|5.0|Wish the Bbc would make this an actual series it has potential. Cumberbatch rocks as Sherlock however I'm not sure how he survived the fall in the cliff hanger ending in season too but was enjoyable to say the least. Also the guy that played Moriarty played him exceptionitly well. Thank you for such a great series even though 3 episodes are kind of short.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I THINK ALL OF THE POUERUPS ARE VERY USEFUL I LOVE SUBWAY SURF CAUSE YOU HAVE TO WORK YOUR WAY UP. I ALSO THINK THAT THE JETPACKS AND POGO STICKS ARE VERY USEFUL BECAUSE WHEN U GET A JETPACK THERE ARE NO TRAINS IN YOUR WAY.
B00499QUK2|5.0|A series that doesn't suck and not run of the mill type show. Really love the character backgrounds and the interactions with Sherlock's brother they kind of give you a background for another series named elementary about what really happened to the love interest of Sherlock.  Would love to see more from this series as I think it has potential and besides who doesn't enjoy a good rub from Sherlock right.
B00CL68NOG|5.0|This was a totally fun movie to watch!!!  To me Streisand knows how to perform to the t.  In a movie or on the stage.  A fantastic performer.<br />The guy that played her son worked so well with Barbara's performance.  Both hit it off on how to act their parts and do it well....Great performer picks for the story from the directors or whomever!  Fun show.
B007EE4XKI|3.0|Picked up this book because it had potential as far as plot and it was about someone in the star trek realm that is just as famous as kirk himself. Dr.noonien soong who ws the creator of data, lore, and his wife sorry can't remember her name. The gist of it is that data searches for his father after an explosion at the daystrom institute implicates him then the chase begins. There were plot problems that to me didn't make sence and unrelated material that didn't need to be there but was fluff for the rest of the book. I'm not telling you not to read but being a star trek fan I couldn't pass it up plus it was about the creation of data. Who doesn't love that right!!!
B00COCY67A|5.0|Never has been and will never be anyone who can top Elvis.  Great collection.  Love the extras.  I highly recommend.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Love the series. Great characters.  Can't wait to see each show. Highly recommend it. Some of the plots are very complicated.
B002VWNIAY|5.0|My husband and I love this movie and have it on vhs.  The quality is really starting to ware and this movie was at the rice price so it will be a Christmas gift for my husband.  Great movie at a great price.  Quality is good.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I liked his writing style, the weaving in of the characters & plot and then the completion of the circle. A good story with a better ending than his previous books.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|This movie was very entertaining and at the right price I wanted to own it.  This was the right price.  I couldn't say no.

B0050DZN4K|1.0|Can't log in on original Kindle Fire, either from inside the app or in the Kindle broswser. Also it doesn't display Chinese properly in titles, they all appear as squares.
B006M4F67A|5.0|This is highly addictive game.  The one thing I hate is that for each chest it costs another $.99 to play.  I am trying to teach my granddaughter mahjong.
0375423966|1.0|I'm just not into books like this, and to me it seemed hard to follow, it seemed to jump around quite a bit, and I hate the style.
B008EEZ64Y|5.0|I loved how the book made you have different emotions .<br />I chose these stars because it was amazing and Lois Lowry is intelligent
B008OOYALE|5.0|Great time passing game. The dragons are so cute and their writeups make me grin. Patience is the lesson as you go slow unless you spend real cash but hey time is something we all have.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|The Kitchen House is a wonderful novel giving you much history. The main protagonists were weaved into a story of love, family unity, torment, abuse and struggling to exist. The storyline takes place in the late 1700's and early 1800's during the Civil War. The author does a fabulous job giving us a storyline about slaves and their owners. There were racial injustices but there was also love between slave and owner. I woke up in the middle of the night and had to read another chapter. Excellent book.
B00CWVG1Z8|1.0|I just finished watching the film Beautiful Creatures. I count finishing it as a small achievement since continuing to watch to the end was pure torture. First, I have never read the books so my review is purely based on the film. Second, it helps to know what I was hoping for because a generally bad review does not mean a movie is bad if it is the kind of film you like. If, like me, you were looking for a movie like The Craft or Ginger Snaps (and the sequels), this is NOT the film for you. Likewise, if you like a good scare, you will not find it here.  As the movie wore on and, I began to pray for it's end, I began to consider why it was so awful. The first thing I noticed is that it was attempting to be funny - not in a clever, tongue in cheek way, but in an Addams Family way except I like the first Addams Family movie and Beautiful Creatures was not funny. Not even the Nancy Reagan joke. On the other hand the movie did not present itself as a comedy at all, in places, quite the opposite. I thought the the Director and Screen Writer did not agree on what film they were making but then I noticed that it was Written (for the screen) and Directed by Richard LaGravenese, a man, apparently, in conflict with himself.  Another issue I had was the acting. Emma Thompson and Jeremy Irons made some truly phoned in performances, I can't even really describe what emma was going for and Irons was just flat. Alice Englert had a few good moments but Alden Ehrenreich, who has the most screen time, is horrible. I mean this in the nicest way.  Lastly we come to internal logic. Any film, even a fantasy film, needs to have an internal and believable logic but Beautiful Creatures has no logic. Mortal characters, having see truly supernatural events, dismiss them the next day. We are told it is a small town but it has a big city football team - check out that running track!  How about the library with tunnels that are \\"all over the country\\". Sigh.  If you must see this movie then I suggest you wait for the $2 bin at Best Buy or get it with a Netflix disc subscription. If you must see a good film with a bad rating, try Mister Frost or Caf&eacute; or Innocent Blood.
B000002I97|5.0|If you like John Prine, buy this cd. Has all the great songs on it. Can make you laugh & cry both. Love him...
B00CWY76CC|4.0|this game keeps my interest. it is challenging just enough. I like it and want more levels. great for people who enjoy solving puzzles.
B00EOO55GW|5.0|Great songs, great vocal and great music.  I loved it.  Perfect songs when you are out running or on treadmill.
B002QRWJA4|5.0|This is just such an amazing rendition of Phantom; I loved every minute of the show and will probably be watching it with sickening regularity!! LOL!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Great games! Cool rooms with fun puzzles and details. Doesn't take long to beat the rooms so I'm looking forward to more content.

B0089LOG02|5.0|Enjoyed the story line and history of this novel.  It was a quick read for me--I couldn't put it down!
B006VRDZ44|5.0|The acting and story line is superb for this series, I am glad that the series is available as a Prime freebie.
B004WGGQPQ|4.0|I would say this app is great for children.  It comes with markers, crayons, colored pencils, stickers and a few other things.  There is no blending or anything advanced on this, but it is fun to mess around with.
B007EE564U|4.0|Hopefully somewhere in the civilised western world there is someone like Mitch who is quietly ridding this world of scumbags
B000VZYPB4|5.0|Very funny!  As someone who started watching this show after the first season, it was Interesting to see how the series began and the character development.
B0013TXA5Y|3.0|This book has all the noticeable twists and turns but is unremarkable in plot as it is way way too predictable. You could see things happening a mile away. Adding incestuous feelings into the mix for a primarily targeted teen audience seems disturbing as well. It keeps you reading with its beautifully delivered details but it's plot is dry and cliche in every way. I hope the next book makes up for it .... if not then don't Bother with this series spun out by a magic obsessed writer who lacks true imagination.
B00BU8RNCE|5.0|Great story about dealing with disaster in a foreign country among some amazing people!  The beautiful camera work about this amazing country.
B0041KKYEM|3.0|It is one of the weirdest films I have ever seen!  The music and ballet are beautiful, but the storyline is very strange. You have to watch very closely to understand it.  Natalie Portman was very good in this and deserved her Oscar.
B0073COMUW|4.0|I'm moving all my lights to LED.  This size fit some of my needs. The true test, how long will they really last
0316228583|2.0|Yes, I read the entire book, even after I had to go back and reread a hundred or so pages because the author had so many different characters in this book and went into such great detail that it ended up being a lot of telling and not showing.  If this would have been a series, perhaps it would have been acceptable, but not in a single book.<br /><br />In short, it was a difficult, unsatisfying read. The only reason I finished it was because JK Rowling wrote it and, sadly, I expected much more than I got from this book.<br /><br />Her two adult books (and I've read both) aren't entertaining and I won't read another without checking reviews first.
B00DV2D0JC|5.0|Pretty good game the story line was really good kept me wanting to come back I play a lot of these type of games the hidden objects are good not to hard but not always easy the mini games are the same way you just have to think about it (ha ha use your head a little) some of the mini scene's even made me jump which was nice because well you don't expect it..over all a great game good play...off to find another happy playing!!!!
B0091REZMW|5.0|This is a good game for those individuals that like to play hidden object games. A must have for all gamers.
B005LAIIHG|4.0|I never read the book and didn't want to watch the movie, but saw it at a friend's house. Even though I didn't see it on the large screen or in 3D, it was mesmerizing. At first I was comfortably seated on a sofa, but midway through the film I found myself hunched forward, literally on the edge of my seat. By the end of the movie I was crying. That's how gripping the cinematography and special effects were, and to a certain extent the story itself. Although some people dislike the alternate ending, I found it wonderful. There are flaws, but the overall experience overcomes them. For example, in the first third of the tale, there is a fair amount of humor. The humor seems oddly out of place in the story as a whole and is soon dispensed with, never to return. There are some anomalies which are not explored, such as an instance where a goat on one side of a barred doorway is apparently taken through to the other side by a tiger. The tiger is a wonderful character and so realistically done that I thought a live animal was being used for much of the film until I learned otherwise. He has a name, Richard Parker, which seems to be an allusion to an actual person, but I don't want to spoil anything by explaining the reference. All the actors are quite good and manage to make you care for them, so when tragedy strikes, it really hits home. Apart from being trapped on a raft in the Pacific, water is a recurring theme, right down to Pi's real name...his full name is that of a French public swimming pool. The idea of rebirth is linked to that, and Pi's growth from introspective teen to self-sufficient man is a part of it. This is a dazzling and enchanting movie, and well worth watching.
B0098PX68G|4.0|This movie was filmed in 2010, before the Sherlock frenzy. Benedict Cumberbatchplays a 29 year old who is dying of cancer (not a spoiler, as the movie opens like that). The movie starts on his birthday, and he knows he won't live to see 30.  Right off the bat you know it's going to be sad. He and his three closest friends decide they will take him to this beach he loves, and try to make it into a fun trip. There is a lot of male bonding, some conflict, and some terrible scenes of Jim (the character) dealing with his pain (he takes morphine and other meds to control his pain).<br />This movie devastated me. The acting is excellent all around, and the ending is just unbearably sad. So you must be in a good place to watch this.
B008133MDK|5.0|This modern take on the Sherlock Holmes story is extremely well done. Interesting takes on the known traditional stories. Actors are wonderful!! True entertainment!!
B000YMM3CC|5.0|I especially love the way they seamlessly go to the past keeping you always on track without loosing any understanding of how their love began... I'm more of an action shoot em' up kind of woman, but this story really tore me up. I loved it.
159463176X|4.0|My first book by this author!  I found the author describing his character, going along and then fast forwarding..... so I could only rate this story as only &#34;liked&#34;.
B000EYK4GW|3.0|I liked this film as a kid, and I still have likes today, but I guess now I feel that the artwork in this movie is a little too bizarre. I guess I liked having this DVD for a while, but I guess the novelty has worn away for me. I mean don't get me wrong, I have 4 favorite things about this film. One is Dumbo because he's a cute baby elephant, Timothy q. Mouse because he is a mouse AND a caring character, always there for Dumbo.  The third is the Casey Junior song. I loved that song, especially on the Zip a dee doo da sing a long video. And fourth is the Pink Elephant scene. This bizarreness of the movie does not bother me, it is a really cool song, ( or the first have anyway). So even though I don't like this film as much now, I was still glad to check the DVD out, especially after hearing it had the Casey Junior sing along song as a bonus feature.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Kids love it and so do I. Easily addictive.<br />How could you not enjoy playing with these cute minions? Highly recommend
B00005JLR2|3.0|I do find this one of the better 2-D Disney films of the early 2000s, and when I finally saw this on TV, I liked it for a little while. I don't like this as much but it is okay. I like B.E.N the robot, Morph the glob parrot, The song &#34;Always There&#34;, and that villain Scroop. And speaking of villain, here is my one major problem with this movie: the other villain Silver is also a deuterogonist kind of character which is really confusing. He makes friends with Jim Hawkins, yet he is his enemy until the end..uh, yeah that is really confusing and I wish Silver was either one or the other. I don't mind this being a world of aliens and people dressing up in 1600s clothing, it feels unique. So I think this film has a good start but still could use a lot of work.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|Well, I was pretty much sobbing by the end of this read. Great story narrated through the eyes of an awesome dog....guess who dies at the end...sigh.
B0079R8KXG|4.0|This case is really well made, the color is beautiful, and the innovation of Marware with the small amount of plastic that hold the Kindle in so well is amazing.  The stand has made reading while eating, or even just sitting, much easier.  I have a little arthritis and so holding the heaviness of the Kindle can be difficult.  However, the way the stand works, it is like a little lap tray that you can balance on your lap, sit on a lap tray, or use on a table.  I am really enjoying it.
0385512058|4.0|I learned so much from Keith Ferrazzi's book \\"Never Eat Alone.\\"  I felt I was a decent networker before reading it, but the author takes us to a different level.  We don't do enough to have networks do the work for us.  I think some of that is the time and energy people fear it will take to build a solid network.  Guess what?  Networks do take work and effort, but if it's done right, the network starts doing work for you because it is constantly in motion.  As a business coach where I invest a lot of time with helping people understand the value of networking, I appreciate  the comments that networking is about getting people to like you, not getting you a job--it sets the right perspective and allows the networker to set different priorities going into the process.  The book provided practical and precise methods that can be done in everyday professional life.  The importance of connecting and the impact it has on our own success was clearly articulated. The \\"Connectors Hall of Fame\\" sections were value enough to read this book.  One of the most poignant points was to focus on your strengths, not your weaknesses using the 80/20 rule.  We should all be \\"sticklers for self-development,\\" but we sometimes focus too much on what we can't do as opposed to the special things we can do. The flavor of the networking conversation will change, not because you are saying, \\"Look at me,\\" but because you are sharing the best parts about you with some vulnerability which will change the small talk to a real connection.  My only criticism to the book was related to some techniques, such as dinner parties.  It seemed to sometimes target an audience of super-networkers, not the common person.  Being someone not looking to hob-nob, but simply looking to build a strong reputation and a working network, I don't think throwing a dinner party monthly is needed for people like me.  The last chapter talks about finding yourself and the comfort with the process. The last chapter itself made the entire book worth the read.  If this is a spoiler alert than it's time to set out and start networking immediately.  - Thomas B. Dowd III, author of the books \\"The Transformation of a Doubting Thomas: Growing from a Cynic to a Professional in the Corporate World\\" and \\"From Fear to Success: A Practical Public-speaking Guide\\"the entire book worth the read.  If this is a spoiler alert than it's time to set out and start networking immediately.  - Thomas B.

B00CDSVZHY|5.0|It is a funny, touching and serious movie all in one.  It has real historical elements that show how horrible slavery was but its also story about a hero that you can root for.
B00005JKNF|4.0|A bit slow in parts but a good movie all the same.  Enjoyed the detail paid to the below stairs crowd.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|When I first got this app, it was a no-nonsense tool for checking the weather.  That quality made it great.  After this last update, it has become something awful.

B005K17RU0|2.0|I open the application, and find a message dancing across the bottom of the screen, Obama has done this, or Obama has done that . .. like he is some sort of fairy godmother.  I find it offensive.  Were it not for the propaganda, I would rate this app highly.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I have nothing bad to say about this book, very well written and I have to say one of the best books I've every read.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|The Fault In Our Stars was one of the most beautifully written books I've read in a very long time. The story of Hazel and Augustus feels so true . It's not a depressing cancer story - it's life affirming.<br /><br />Two teenagers with cancer (one who is terminal) meet and fall in love. Their story, which could have been so cliched in lesser hands, is honest and funny and uplifting and romantic and deep. I highly recommend this book.
B002C949KE|5.0|This book was a very interesting one with results of experiments on human nature.  Some of it was surprising, some I predicted the results on my own before I read them.  It took me a while to get through the book because there is so much information to absorb.  I would read, then put it down to reflect on it.
B006LSZECO|5.0|What a wicked wicked brain Ms Flynn does possess ! She thinks of everything ... at times i actually feel sorry for Nick ! Great book, i listened to it as opposed to reading it, and i think i must have listened to it ten times over, to catch every nuance. Great writing, great topic ... ... pure evil, of the non-scientific sort !!

B00A27X972|5.0|I was not sure what to expect from The Humans... I just bought it on a whim.  I like how the author reflects on humanity through the eyes of an alien.<br /><br />It is a fast paced, first person point of view, leaving you wanting to read more at the end of each chapter.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|It is a great movie with lots of emotion.  It's set in the USA, but I believe the real story that it is based upon took place in Japan.  Worth watching, for sure
B00003CXSM|4.0|This movie was a nice addition to my collection of dvd's.  I love Matthew and J Lo in this move.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Great action sequence and great continuation and merge of all the other stories!  Watch and be impressed!  Go Mr Stark!
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|Fun game to play.  I like the different levels and islands.  I find some of the levels challenging. Not fond of all the advertisement, but then the game was free so it is to be expected.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I started watching a bit late and had to catch up on all the old episodes.  So now I'm ready for the new season to start.  This is such a great story of the way things were in the 1920's.

B005J3IEZQ|5.0|Kudos to Walter for sticking to the objective compass as one must when penning a biography.<br />Kudos more so to the author, for the subject has magically influential powers with his distortion field.<br />Also grasped the inner design need for iPhone, iPad and their organic conception.<br />Added another layer in my understanding of open vs closed ecosystem wrt integrated design principles.<br />Re emphasises the notion of following your dreams and not believing in the labels of expertise tht world bestows on you.<br />And far more importantly to just keep moving on and to risk it all every now and then.<br />To either keep being born or keep dying. To move. To act. To fail. To cry. To love. To live. To create. To serve.
B0058OUJA4|5.0|I will report back about the gameplay as soon as possible, but it seems great so far and the price is right!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I personally love this app. It may be annoying in the beginning because of all of the waiting but it gets better after that. 5 stars<br /><br />!
B0090SI56Y|4.0|The X-Men films have always been kind of hit-or-miss, in my opinion. The first 2 installments are both really good (X2 the best out of the pair), but they seem underwhelming to me in a way, being a fan that watched other superhero films first, ones that were more recent and had more of a fanbase. As any fan knows, X3 failed to impress in almost every respect, only delivering fully action-wise and with a certain after- credits scene. First Class is definitely the best of the bunch, even though it does get fairly juvenile at times with the younger mutants' story lines. Origins was a spin-off film that still didn't reveal anything new about the character, and was a convoluted mess because of it, despite some great action scenes. And they have all done their part to confuse fans with the continuity errors and plot holes. However, even after all this, they are still very well done. They have some of the best casts ever assembled, and boast top-shelf special effects. This particular film is an excellent example of that. Jackman returns to the role that made him famous among American audiences, sharing the screen with a mostly foreign cast that still manages to hold its own. It is an adaptation of the comics' Japan Saga, but holds several surprises due to some worthwhile liberties taken. Logan finds himself in a dark place after the events of X3. He is basically just a wanderer, much like he was before the events of X1. He is asked to return to Japan as part of a favor for a man whose life he saved during World War II. Once he gets there, nothing proves to be as it seems. The country holds many enemies and a few friends for him, and he might just not come out of it alive. I say that with absolute seriousness. Due to a certain critical plot point, Wolverine might just lose what makes him a mutant and not be able to get it back. And I won't even talk about who Wolverine has been seeing in some very weird visions, because that would just be wrong. There is action, suspense, and tragedy aplenty. Jackman gives a terrific performance, finally being able to deliver on what Origins fell far short of doing - really figuring out the Wolverine character, emotionally, mentally, and physically. The only problem I had with the film is that the story required a certain amount of filling stuff in for myself, and some stuff that I had to ask others about afterwards. I should also mention that as far as continuity with the other films, this one acts as its own entity. It sidesteps all the controversy - taking place sometime after X3 - but no more specific than that. It also weaves in one of the better plot points from X3 as part of the story, and is all the better because of it. Since it is totally Wolverine's story, the other X-Men don't physically appear. Therefore, no one needs worry about overlapping plots or anything like that. As long as one is able to overlook the very minor disadvantages of the film, they will agree that it is a  great film, a great superhero movie, along with great performances by Jackman and his foreign co-stars.
B009X012XM|2.0|I like the kind that auto sleep / wake up your kindle and I was disappointed this one does not. I thought they all did :(
B008JFUPFI|5.0|(Note: this is a review of the movie itself, not the discs or packaging or whatnot)<br /><br />I say that because the premise of X-Men: First Class and Man of Steel have some striking comparisons. But while Marvel chose to focus their heroes on fighting for survival in a dog-eats-dog-eats-mutant world, Christopher Nolan's film portrays Clark Kent, though rejected by most &#34;normal&#34; people, as really being &#34;the better man&#34;. Multiple times in the movie (no spoilers of major plot), Clark comes up against someone who bullies him. And he could crush them. Literally. Most likely with both hands behind his back. But he never does. He always chooses the high road.<br /><br />In an age where people seem to love a hero with a dark side, Man of Steel reminds us that there is a dividing barrier between good and evil, and you can only go so far before you become what you're trying to fight. But the movie is not preachy by any stretch of the imagination, and there's a lot of super-cool action sequences.<br /><br />Really, the way the fights play out is some of the best CG stuff I've seen. It actually looks like two titans clashing. Buildings don't just get damaged, they fall like card houses. One guy throws Clark three hundred yards, and instead of just skidding on the pavement, it crumbles around him. Watching in I-MAX 3d, I felt like the whole room was shaking around me.<br /><br />And of course, the acting is superb, particularly the scenes between Clark and his biological father. What less could we expect from a Nolan film? 5 stars
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game may look like 100 floors but so much better i recommend this game to anyone. It keeps you thinking

B006M4F67A|5.0|The Mahjong games are all great and some are spectacular as you download more and more of their games. AWESOME!!!!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Absolutely iconic. The story makes you fall in love with the characters without ever feeling like its dragging. It's endlessly quotable, but perhaps the most significant feature of the novel is how even though most of us have never and will never be in a similar situation, it's relatable on a fundamental level. That fact, combined with the sheer publicity around the book's release, makes it a must-read in modern literature, in my opinion.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I enjoyed reading through all of the  Wool stories in the omnibus edition. There's something vivid, straightforward, and fresh about the writing and the portrayal of the characters. I particularly liked the strong figures in the early part of the series. Not so much plotted as a well story-boarded unfolding of an unsolved conspiracy. Some of the Amazon reviews of the next two books seem disappointed, and I haven't decided whether to plow forward or not ...
B005VT42BS|5.0|This is a great utility for someone who has a local area network they need to inspect. I've preferred to use this over the command prompt for certain things I'm doing. It shows services for ip addresses very quickly and just works.
B0084YAU86|5.0|This series is rare and special in that it is incredibly smart in terms of writing; the directing is riveting,  the characters are engaging and the acting is exceptional.  I wait eagerly for the next episode and would gladly pay for the next one right away. This kind of storytelling and acting is worth waiting and greatly to be recommended.

B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is such a fun yet challenging game. It takes a couple of levels to 'get it' and you have to really think about the clues to use them correctly, which makes every little piece of the ultimate puzzle for each room feel like a real victory when you finally accomplish it. Never played anything like this! Love it!
B00D7Z4GQY|2.0|The secret was all too easy to figure out & you just knew it wasn't going to end well for anyone.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|Really good game the only thing I dont like is how most of the ponies cost gems or you have to play balloon pop and it cost hearts which I think is flat out dumb and also rarity coast gems and yet don't even try

B00785P2QC|5.0|I like this game but I think that all of the expansions should be the same price. I also think that there shouldn't be energy.

B000ME5B30|4.0|Is An Inconvenient Truth truly credible? I like Al Gore but seeing with my own eyes is believing, otherwise it's blind faith.
B00DENXXZ4|1.0|Only thing I can think if is that there's some sort of detection of hdmi cable connection that switches off streaming which is crazy bad coding.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Sad to say there isn't one more book to read in this series.  Somehow the end was somewhat limp.  I did enjoy the trilogy immensely. Hope the movies are true to the books. mjk
B006M7JCC2|3.0|I would love to believe that all people that die receive what the author did in her near death experience.It is something to take comfort in to believe that the overwhelming love,acceptance and peace is waiting us and was felt by all who have died before us.<br />The rest of the book I found hard to get through.Then it became too self absorbed.Not everyone can take the time she did to revel in doing little except concentrate on themselves.If one came back from this experience to take care of children,work for a living,perhaps the story would be shorter and different.

B00C1SPB4Y|5.0|Great dead-pan but comical humor throughout. It's very well written, and makes great use of skilled delivery and quick punchlines. Also one of the best examples of a TV show (from the late 80's) which utilizes realistic portrayals of human interactions and subtleties; a standard in today's television.

B002C949KE|4.0|A great book that reads easy and gives you so much insight as to how we humans think, predictably irrational. If you're a marketer, salesperson, user experience guy, work with volunteers is a must. This book makes you think twice about a lot of regular things and its helpful in live altogether. Get it.

B00CWY76CC|1.0|My son and I both have tried to play this game on my Kindle. We cannot get it to work. We do not know if this game is compatible with my Kindle.

B0070UFMOW|5.0|I was really hesitant to shell out more than a C-note for a portable pre-amp, considering I do most of my \\"serious\\" listening through digital HDMI out/flac/Amarra, etc.<br /><br />But, obviously, if you are an audio nerd enough to understand the aforementioned stuff, you probably know where this is going ... I bought the E17.<br /><br />And I love it.<br /><br />I can't believe how much presence and stereo separation this thing brings to the table. Plenty of other reviews have probably already addressed this. I use the Audio Technica ATHM50s, and I will occasionally boost the treble slightly to bring out some of the sparkle in techno/trance/IDM/EDM/Niki & the Dove, etc.<br /><br />But honestly, what I love about the E17 is that for the most part, I can just play it, and it sounds so freakin' good that I don't have to worry about tweaking anything. I can just enjoy the music.<br /><br />Good luck finding something this baby won't drive; I think it is rated up to 600 OHM.<br /><br />Pesonally, I have never used it with anything but the LOD cables that FiiO make, and I really don't picture myself ever looking for a better portable headphone amp.<br /><br />I've also used it from my Macbook Air to play 24-bit/96khz and it plays that from Amarra without a hitch. Which is pretty impressive for something under $200.<br /><br />My ONE flaw I've noticed is that it once froze on me when I unplugged USB while it was charging (can't remember if it was playing music or not) without turning it off. I have probably done this hundreds of times, and I'm not sure if you're not supposed to, so maybe you should turn it off first before unplugging it from USB. Honestly, I probably won't stop doing this, and I can guarantee I will not bothering checking the manual,<br /><br />But, never fear!, I simply put a pin inside to find the \\"reset\\" button and she was good as new!<br /><br />If you are at all wondering, \\"is it worth it,\\" there is absolutely no question. Just get it. You won't go back. And if you need to justify it to yourself, just tell yourself how much pleasure you can get from music, and stop depriving yourself already!<br /><br />I know I did, and I have ever looked back.

1250030951|5.0|The book description was intriguing, but I was not prepared for how much I would love reading Fangirl. It is one of those rare stories that just made me smile, when I wasn't marveling at how well the author gets it.<br /><br />Cath is starting college at the University of Nebraska, but she's not your typical freshman. She's nerdy and awkward and comes with bucketloads of social anxiety, and she'd much rather stay in her dorm room writing fanfiction than get drunk at a frat party. She's always depended on her twin sister for her social life, but Wren wants to have the hard-partying college experience and has refused to room with Cath, who gets stuck with an intimidating older student. Many of the elements here are common to coming-of-age stories--there's first love and family drama--but Fangirl is also about writing, and being a fan, and it encapsulates the experience of being a social misfit in college. Or at least, one experience of it: having a lot in common with Cath, I had to reconcile myself early on to the fact that there are differences (major differences) between her freshman experience and mine--but those are details; on an emotional level I found this story to be real and true.<br /><br />This is a character-driven book, so I'll start with the characters. Cath is fantastically-realized, quirky, and fun, and there's so much that I love about Rowell's portrayal of her, but here's the most important thing: it's okay to be like Cath. Cath has a lot going for her--she's smart, witty, loyal and caring--and growing up means growing in her own direction, learning to handle new relationships and thrive in a new environment, not changing who she is. Cath doesn't get a makeover or become a wild child or give up fanfiction. She's a nerd, without having to be either the genius type or a super-sexy babe. And she's completely believable; even where I would have had the opposite reaction, her feelings and behavior always rang true to her character.<br /><br />But the other characters are great too, wholly authentic and often endearing. The book is largely driven by dialogue, and while Rowell's prose is nothing special, the dialogue sparkles. It brings the characters to life and it's often humorous, but it's also so exactly the way people talk to one another, I think I've had some of these conversations. The romance is genuinely sweet, with characters who seem like a good fit for one another, and I loved that Cath's hangups about physical affection don't just disappear once she's in a relationship; it's something she has to work on.<br /><br />Then too, the book is a celebration of the intense relationships we develop with fictional characters and worlds. Cath is a fan of Simon Snow, a stand-in for Harry Potter: and she's a big-name fan, with thousands of people following her writing. I loved the way Cath's writing is treated: it's taken seriously, as a major aspect of her life and a talent to be proud of--even by her writing professor, a novelist herself, who sees Cath's potential but can't stand the thought of fanfiction. (They have multiple conversations about this, as the professor becomes something of a mentor for Cath. I'm telling you, this book is nerd heaven!) My biggest criticism of the book is that it could have just referred to Harry Potter by name and been less campy; this might have caused problems with the inclusion of snippets from the \\"Simon Snow\\" books and a few lengthy chunks of Cath's fanfiction, but these are largely extraneous to the story anyway. However, Rowell does a great job with the fanfiction excerpts, which are polished while still sounding like something an 18-year-old girl would write.<br /><br />In the end, there are so many scenes and little moments in this book that struck a chord with me. I love that Cath attends a big state university--there are so few novels set in college, and most of them seem to be about people quoting poetry at one another at small liberal arts colleges; I loved reading aboutthe kind of school I attended, with a huge campus, where people work part-time and aren't necessarily academically-oriented. I loved Cath's realization that she comes from a mostly rural state where her experience growing up in Omaha isn't the norm; I had that too. And the clashing assumptions about sex between Cath and her roommate. And Cath's arguing with her boyfriend about whether or not his chivalry is respectful. And her heightened awareness of her safety on campus at night (even though physical danger is not a part of this story): I too have dialed 911 on my cell phone just in case. I could go on, but you get the picture.<br /><br />Fangirl isn't great literature, but it's a fun, funny and true-to-life story of an experience I haven't seen fictionalized before, and for that I love it. Recommended to anyone who's been weird in college, or anyone who sees that in their future. I wish I could have read it when I was 17.the kind of school I attended, with a huge campus, where people work part-time and aren't necessarily academically-oriented.

B002MQYOFW|1.0|This was my first audio book I have ever downloaded and listened to. The Hunger Games is not a type of book I would normally read but because of its popularity I figured it was a good experiment.<br />I have to say I really liked the experience of being read to and thought this reader did great. But as to the book itself I find it utterly disturbing that this book of &#34;voluntary murder&#34; by children under the shallow guise of government &#34;obligation&#34; would be such a popular topic for children. I also find it additionally disturbing that in an age when American children are actually killing each other in schools and on the streets this book encouraging such in their already confused minds has received no uprising of disfavor by anyone; Church, State, or Child Protection Agency. Add to that my surprise in finding such a book of mental confusion supporting the violence of murder by children would have been written by a young woman and I am simply dumbfounded. &#34;Go Katniss!&#34;
B007FEFLTO|3.0|I like better the first book of the Trilogy: The Fall of Giants. It is a more accurate less money making oriented than &#34;Winter....&#34; which I consider a light novel written to comply with massive tastes, and lacks agility to mix the story telling with the sexual matters that are too much emphasized for my taste. It was a complete disappointing book.

B004EPZ03O|5.0|The Muppets are back with a movie that went to movie theaters for the first time since 1999's Muppets From Space even through they did have a couple of made for TV movies. And you might also expect that the Muppets have broken up and are apart from each other. The movie also got its first Oscar for the song Man or a Muppet, which can be unbelievable as some from earlier movies you might have thought would have gotten, but maybe they were not worthy for them. The movie even has Amy Adams that was no near as famous as she is now the last time the Muppets had a movie that went to movie theaters. As the movie opens you see a character that looks like a Muppet named Walter (Peter Linz) growing up in Smalltown with his brother Gary (Jason Segel) and they grow up as high fans of the Muppets even with a tape of their old TV show. And now as adults Gary and his girlfriend Mary (Amy Adams) have now been a couple for 10 years, and as part of it he is taking her to Los Angeles for a vacation. And Walter sounds down about not getting to go, until Gary pulls a surprise  that he has got him a ticket to go too which includes a tour of the Muppets Studios. Mary works as a teacher at a school, that she is going on a 2 week spring break. And that begins when Gary picks her up for the trip. THen they take a bus to Los Angeles, which they hit to the first stop which is and you guessed it the Muppet Studios, where they met a short tour group which is led by Alan Arkin. The tour stops includes the outside of  Kermit's office, when nobody is looking Walter enters the office, and is hidden under a table, where he sees Statler and Waldorf selling the Muppets Studios to Tex Richman (Chris Cooper ) and his henchmen Bobo the Bear and Uncle Deadly, and even explains that if the Muppets can raise 10 million dollars, before their contract expires they can purchase back the Muppet Studios which includes the Muppet theater of where did their show from. And when they are gone, and when Tex Richman thinks that his and his henchman are alone, he explains to them \\"there is oil under the theater, and his plan is to destroy the theater, and drill for it. Unaware that Walter is under the table, and overheard his plan, and he catches up with Gary and Mary and is still screaming about what he has heard. And now the plan is to find Kermit the Frog, and to tell them what Walter has heard. They do mange to find his house, which Walter faints when he sees me, and reawakens in his home. He tells him about the plan, and Kermit says the only thing can can be done is to get the Muppets back and do a show,  and that is what they do. They mange to get most of the Muppets back, expect for Miss Piggy and now starts looking at channels to present their show on, which all gets rejected until they met with CDE executive Veronica (Rashida Jones) which she says no at first, and shows them what is popular, and where they are on as far as poplar which is not a big precent. But she does give them a timeslot of Punch Teacher, when they suddenly walk out and she has nothing else to replace it with. But the big condition she gives to the Muppets is to find a celebrity guest host. That is all that I am going to revel, and I am going to leave it up to you to find out what will happen. But I would have loved it if the movie had explained, well first how are Walter and Gary are brothers since when is a human, and the other a Muppet, and just what did happen that led to the break up of the Muppets even if it could have been explained to where it doesn't take up  a lot of the story.

B00A9V2JSG|5.0|I couldn't put this down! I thought it was just as good as, if not better than, The Hunger Games!
B009MYARIK|5.0|Like all Sophie kinsella books this one make me laugh a lot. From the beginning you experience the mystery along with the humor that characterize this excellent author.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|I loved this movie, but be sure to check local listings first before purchasing it on Amazon because it's been on TV lots recently.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Best book ever! Ender  and Bean are my very favorite characters. I can't wait to read the next book in the series.
0955153077|5.0|Love it! the gallery at the end of the book is so friggen beautiful! The tutorials are easy to follow and provide a great foundation in a cool new art! it would be cool to try making some concept art for games or stories this way!
1451613512|5.0|You think you know US history? Think again. You won't be able to put it down. It is a real eye opener. This book isn't just for tin foil types either.
B009NQZVKG|4.0|I've read all his Sigma Force novels and this is my second favorite! I tore through in just a couple days.
B0066W1AZK|1.0|I it played  it as a teenager years  ago  but have  no  desire  to relearn in my mid life. I pass.
B00ESY7QXI|2.0|I THOUGHT THE SPECTACLE OF HE SHOW WAS WAY OVERDONE, WITH IMAGES COMING AT ME SO RAPIDLY THE STORY GOT RELEGATED TO SECOND (OR WORSE) PLACE.  A LITTLE SUBTLETY WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN A BAD IDEA.
B005K17RU0|1.0|Unless you are carrying your kindle everywhere you go better weather reports are available on the net or on tv.
B00B1D7ANK|4.0|This is not the small dragon I expected. It is about 10 inches long and 8 inches high and it moves its wings!  It is very detailed and life like like all Schleich figures. This is a must for all dragon fans.
B007EC27QM|3.0|Everything comes with a built in calculator now a days, it is redundant to have one on my kindle. It is a reader, game machine.
B000FBJAEG|4.0|So many twists and turns...had me going from the start!  Worth every penny I paid.  And I never saw the twist at the end until it was right there
B007VUA7VO|1.0|It is supposed to monitor your power level, but kindle comes with  a power monitor of its own already and this app sucks power!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Fun! We play all the time! Love the goals and the secret places. Fluffy unicorn and mega minion are my favorites. Gotta play!
0307744434|5.0|I enjoy reading fantasy that is based on fact, and this story weaves a wonderful pattern of an extraordinary circumstance and gives it a great deal of verisimilitude. The love stories within the tale seem very possible, and as demanding, exhilarating, and suspenseful as any I have read in years. The depth of detail (which some reviewers criticized) were entirely acceptable to me as a necessary part of a complex story. Altogether, I loved it!
B001MW0IY8|5.0|Introspective, universal, ethereal.This is what I have come to expect from Antony and the Johnsons, and they do not disappoint.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|It has been a while since I read a book that made me feel so many emotions. Enzo's perspective was very powerful, and the story engaging.  Worth every second.
B008KYOCA2|5.0|I can update my schedule in a matter of minutes. I love the reminders, never late again! It is so easy to access, make entries and update!
B004AM5QT4|2.0|This is the most boring Follett novel ever. Predictable, non-dimensional characters, no back stories or sub-plots.  Reads like it was dashed out over a weekend with too many other things for the author to do. I am rarely disappointed by Follett but this book is not kind to his readers...Plausible? No Way...and what is with all these \\"angry\\" dysfunctional women who are emerging as main characters with absolutely no charm or interests. BLAH.
B003B02PF4|3.0|The ending of the book was lack luster and left some story lines unfinished.  The ending was somewhat unbelievable.  It was hard to really pull for the main character.  He never really seemed remorseful for his mistakes.
B00D4LKOVC|4.0|Cute, funny and innocenct.  Relax get out the popcorn and settle in for a good time.  Young Tom Hanks and Darryl Hannah (not sure if spelled correctly) give us the innocence of the fantasy and carry it through to the end.  They don't skip a beat.  Good show for naughty John Candy, too.
1250012570|5.0|Excellent portrayal of teen thought and motivation. The story had real life situations and teen reactions-- especially insightful were Eleanor's dealings with abuse and poverty. The author did an excellent job of giving a message, entertaining and keeping it true to life. And the ending was perfect!
B00CW6DAKC|3.0|I was playing this game and visting my neighbors farms and then my farm disapeired and nh farm was now mu neighbors. other wise it is fun.
B004KBSQOW|5.0|This highlights the best of the famous Hawaiian singer, and one feels like you are transformed to a vacation on the islands, just listening is very soothing.

0061950726|5.0|This was an interesting story of courage, perseverance, a story worth telling. Many people don't know about all the children who went into foster care and were shipped across country,  &#34;auctioned&#34; off almost like slaves, into varying family situations.  This story embraces several characters of different time periods who were both part of those orphan children, and is a heart warming story of overcoming adversity.
B00D5TASOG|5.0|I'm not going to give a song by song review here - all I'm going to say is that if you enjoy the Films of David Lynch you will enjoy this record and you will want it in your collection. I bought it on vinyl and have been enjoying it all Summer. Lynch is a good observer of what works in music and what doesn't and puts his skills of music appreciation to work here - and adds his own unique spin to it creating a great set of smart strange Lynchian pop music Highly recommended.
B002OR0RP0|4.0|My kids LOVED this movie :) I love that I can download it to my iPad. Makes travel so much easier.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I bought this game based on the price, reviews, and concept. It delivered up to expectations despite seeming rather short. It was challenging enough to stump me several times, but simple enough that I could come back to at a later time and solve it with a fresh perspective. Definitely worth it if you like the room escape type of game.
B0058OUJA4|2.0|Certain towers can only be used on certain maps kinda sucks... Makes strategy out the door because of limited towers. Need more towers also
B000NY17J6|5.0|I grew up on these songs and love them as much as I did as a kid. My mom had Linda Rondstat playing all the time on the HiFi turntable which was a giant piece of furniture - totally 70s cool. My dad listened to the 8-track. We even had friends with a reel-to-reel who played it as well. Along came cassette and then came CD. With the mp3 additional download, I guess this means I've been able to listen to it in every format. I'm feeling mighty old. I still have my mom's old albums so maybe I'm feeling nostalgic but I'm about to crank the tunes and go hit the highway for a ride.<br /><br />Now - what song do I listen to first?
1935670913|5.0|well I am new at being an author and have been researching for advice, this book was a great find for me, I strongly believe that some of the advice given here will increase my sales and that alone makes it worthwhile. here is a book that I wrote. [[ASIN:B00DK7JST4 The Secret Recipe Book]], this is a 92 page recipe book and the kindle version is only 99 cents, please read it and leave a review. it is full of delicious recipes including home made guacamole, and ranch salad dressing.
B00CA3C1N4|2.0|I saw no point to this app. I expected something different I guess. Check the description. I ended up uninstalling it.
0525478817|5.0|wow, this is a great book. I am not going to ruin the story line for you, but I will say that there is a reason why this book is so popular!, I myself recently wrote a couple of books for those of you who might be interested, the kindle versions of my books are only 99 cents, [[ASIN:B00DK7JST4 The Secret Recipe Book]], [[ASIN:1482692678 Casino Survival Guide.: Breaking The Bank]], [[ASIN:1482652919 Alchemy Survival Guide: The Labyrinth Made Simple (Volume 4)]]
B00BF123WG|5.0|But it is tough to take. Be warned it is not for the weak of heart. War his hell and the things that happen in war are no fun. The scenes of interrogation are very realistic. For a realistic view of how we have to respond to terrorism and what it does to people, it is very worth seeing for sure.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|love puzzle type games....this one fun trying to figure out where to find hidden objects and when to use them in correct sequence....I'm hooked!
B006INDMEE|4.0|I wanted to see this film because of the subject matter and because I like Helen Mirren as an actress. All in all I did enjoy it, but the plot, while compelling was a little manipulative. Worth watching though.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|It's a good book, and extremely thought provoking. I didn't imagine I would get so sad, or become so attached.
B009SCRERI|5.0|my daughters is 5yrs old and she watches this movie just about everyday. she can't wait for the pirate fairies.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Love this game! It's very addictive. I have played 100 floors and all the other games where you have to escape and this one seems to be more challenging. I love it!!!
B00633W614|5.0|So glad he has started a new series.  Like that it  starts with WW1.  he makes history enjoyable to read
B0006213XA|5.0|This is my favorite movei ever. I was so happy to see that i could purchase the DVD for a good price. I'm happy
B008BU75IQ|5.0|Cannot hardly wait for the next book.  It cannot be too soon.  He is meticulous in his detail about the time and the happenings
B003UESJFQ|5.0|Unbelievable that this happened so late in the century but it did.  Made me want to really stand up and<br />make sure everyone gets reasonable wages!
B002VPE1WK|3.0|This bag does what it is designed for, holds all your stuff....but the bag itself is actually so big, that I never take it anywhere....granted I am not a professional photographer either....just have a nice camera because I act like I want to be a photographer when taking pictures of my kids.
B00A6KGDDM|5.0|This is yet another superb disc from Quatuor Eb&egrave;ne.  Their disc of Debussy, Faur&eacute; and Ravel won Gramophone's Recording of the Year award, and I think this is in the same league.<br /><br />There is a perception in some quarters that Felix Mendelssohn was a bit lightweight and not a great composer.  I think these works and performances show that to be wholly untrue.  There is genuine depth and musical brilliance here both in the youthful A minor quartet and the intense, more mature F minor.  I hadn't heard Fanny Mendelssohn's quartet before (to my shame) and it is also very, very good - full of genuine skill and inventiveness, and a very engaging work to listen to.<br /><br />What makes this disc shine is the performance of Quatuor Eb&egrave;ne.  We are blessed to have a lot of very fine string quartets performing at the moment, and Quatuor Eb&egrave;ne are among the very best.  Their technique and intonation are rock-solid and they have formed themselves into a wonderfully empathetic chamber unit.  As an example, take the Allegro di molto section of the 3rd movement of the A minor quartet.  There is a lot of very quick, super-fine work on the first violin which is made to sound easy, but also, unflashily in the background, wonderfully nimble, sensitive cello playing.  The whole thing hangs together and blends beautifully, and makes perfect emotional sense among the virtuosic playing.  And then the finale begins with Death-And-The-Maiden-like intensity and we are off in another completely different but equally involving direction.  It is quite wonderful playing, all put to the service of the music rather than the glory of the musicians.  The rest of the disc is just as good.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this too highly.  It is excellent music, beautifully played and very well recorded.  A real gem.
B00DHNBPA6|2.0|as a stand alone it was good. as a rewrite it sucked. so the junkie sister lives at the end everyone else of course is dead. no slapstick one liners just pure gore.
B000VZYPB4|5.0|I could watch this show all day. The writing is fantastic and the actors carry it off brilliantly. Well done!
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Long, but well worth the read.  This is the third book, but was hooked on the first book.  I've not watched the HBO series because I wanted to read the books.  Still reading.... till I read the last one.
B005N09L5C|1.0|The book was more descriptive. Couldn't tell what was really going on in the movie. The English accents of the characters were somewhat difficult to understand.
B00DHSK3RM|3.0|Not enough help, thought it would have help for every level or at least more of the difficult ones.  It only has a handful which is hardly enough, and I am a pretty good player.
B00CPTUNBK|5.0|Great movie my little pony fans of all ages will enjoy Twilight Sparkles journey to retrieve a magical crown in this parallel universe.
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|Cool I loved asphalt 7 but it was a soooooo but now I plays very smooth hardly any lagging at all.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|Great App, super easy and really convenient!  Makes any Google Searching easy to access at the press of a button.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|A very  well written book .  Fast moving  with  twists in every chapter.  This story reads like a fast paced  soap opera.
B00D7JGL36|5.0|Well Done !!!!
1616550414|5.0|This is the definitive guide for those fans Legend of Zelda. This guide is really perfect, all pages in color.
B00AHHODH2|5.0|The mystery of Whodunit combined with the &#34;characters&#34; kept me picking it back up. I was very surprised at the ending, and a little confused when part of the narrative from the beginning was repeated verbatim at the end. (?)
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I have stood in the arcade playing this game for hours..LOL. who would have thought a digital version would be just as addictive?  There is something mildly soothing about this format as well.  I find it an enjoyable expense of time.
B000VMFDW2|5.0|I learned about this book after watching the series, like many others.<br /><br />It is quite unimaginable for me, going through a situation like Mr. Sledge and his comrades had to go through from Marine basic training to the hell of battles like Peleliu and Okinawa. The thought of watching friends die in the most horrible ways, the shelling, killing , deprivation of water, food and sleep, is simply impossible to imagine to someone like myself, accustomed to comfort of modern life and simple repetitive jobs.<br /><br />That is the true face of war, an environment where even the most kind of persons, can be turned into a soulless merciless beast. That is what war does to people.<br /><br />I found the book absolutely interesting, revealing and honest. Would recommend to anyone interested in learning more on those dark chapters of history.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|A heartbreaking, frustrating, beautiful sequel to The Selection. Kiera is an excellent storyteller who has a gift for making her characters superior in depth and heart. This trilogy is a must read for all YA Book lovers!
B00A285OOW|5.0|I know what happened. I just so wanted it to be different. As the inevitable approached, I thought surely the executioner gets a day off. What's not to love about Philippa Gregory? I have read most of her work and  can honestly say, I loved everything I read. I grow affectionate of her characters and detest some mightily. I also learn amazing things about England. Anyone with an interest in the history of the English Royal family with intense character development will be delighted.
B008SOS63S|5.0|I liked this cd so much, I went to see Joe at the Beacon theater on 5/18/13 .It was the best concert I ever saw
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|Really like game . puzzles fun different things to do . energy bar could start off bigger takes a while to increase. Would prefer to buy things because I can't stop playing not just to get one more puzzle but we all gotta eat. All in all I like the game just need to have 2 favorite games going at same time while energy regenerates
B0074JODP8|5.0|Joe is a great guitarist and great performer . I would recommend this DVD to any guitar lovers . He's the greatest
B00CEMH31Q|5.0|Bought this cd today before attending their show and love it! Already was grooving to it in the car and great to hear the stuff live. Fantastically talented boys that stand the test of time.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|This game is awful I hate it I puked at it. Sike I loved it the best angry bird game ever
B00785P2QC|3.0|I like it. especially wherevyou make money sleeping. need more ways to get credits though without having to buy them.
B00B22ASUM|5.0|My cat Mau and I, we saved each other. I miss him dearly. The book was an awesome read, bittersweet.
B00D7JGL36|5.0|I love it! Vince Gill is a great musician and does a great job on all these songs! Wonderful steel guitar too!
B0096YJDNQ|5.0|Great fun!! What could be better than being out late at night with you best girl look at the stars in the heavens and the stars in each others eyes
1401938906|4.0|It was okay and the info was worthwhile but I've read this stuff all before--nothing new. Same info in a different format.<br />It still basic &#34;law of attraction&#34; ie. &#34;the Secret&#34;.
B00CH26TL8|3.0|i was only able to get 29 levels on this game when it froze and now no longer moves forward.  I am very dissapointed by that.  I tried contacting the folks there but the email i received in response was of no help and came across as a blow-off truthfully.  The game is fun, and gets you to use geometry to get hard shots, but I can ony give it 3 stars due to this major glitch of not being able to move forward nor resolve the problem.
B0045EA1P6|5.0|Great album!  I like every song, which is very rare for me.  If you liked &#34;Some Nights&#34;, then do yourself a favor and get &#34;Aim and Ignite&#34; as well.
B0091REZMW|2.0|Frustrated! Every update seems to mess things up!  Rooms completed do not drop the gifts it should.  Usually I get 2 gifts...if I'm lucky.  Just want it to work right!
B00EFNXPFK|4.0|John Mayer serves up another solid effort with Paradise Valley.  Although not as reflective and deep as his masterpiece, Born and Raised, the new album has the sound and feel of Born and Raised.  I highly recommend it.
B00BP4ZNFM|5.0|Rented this on my PS3. I will never, ever, rent another film from Amazon Prime. The \\"HD\\" film on my 15Mb line had terrible banding and chatter around mis-colored bands in dark areas, which were also terribly crushed. I've never seen such a bad reproduction.  iTunes would never allow something this bad to go out - they double-screen every encode - but apparently Amazon doesn't care. I don't know who they use for transcoding, but it sure as heck wasn't Deluxe or any reputable company. DO NOT watch this. Rent the blu-ray or go to iTunes.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|will reorder the product.  Will keep on reading the authors listed.  Enjoyed all of the books and the products emensly
B00BF11STU|1.0|The story of how the USA executed a suspect without evidence or trial and then dumped the body at sea!
B001NLKZUA|5.0|This Is probably the best series I've ever read. Once you start reading it, you'll get hooked! I definitely recommend this series to anyone who wants to get in a great series!
B000006Y4E|4.0|This was Def Leppard's album in which they hooked up with Mutt Lange, producer, who started the very polished version you hear today.  This album showcases their beginning rough around the edges sound with a sprinkling of what they would become.
B003B02O0A|5.0|John Grisham,  A Time To Kill,  has quickly become one of my favorite writers.  He creates suspenseful thrillers that are hard to turn down. I was unable to put this book down and ended up reading it within a couple of days.  I recommend to anyone who loves mystery and suspense.
B004WO57E4|5.0|Finally I can play Heroes I and II on a computer running Windows 7.  It's great having all of the games and expansions in one set of CD's.
0061122416|3.0|I like the overall message and it definitely is thought provoking despite simplicity of the language. I was even ok with the extreme spirituality until (spoiler alert!) he started talking to the sun and  turned into wind. That and cliches like love at first sight without even speaking were turn offs.
B005I4JG80|5.0|I found the book very interesting, I come from a country where babies are raised somewhat similarly to the French, certainly very different from the way they are raised in the US. However, I have lived in the US for many years and after having two children caught myself that I have largely adopted the American parenting style. This book reminded me about how I was raised and helped me realize that in some ways I am very different from American parents, it does sometimes show and makes me feel a bit awkward when I socialize with US moms. Not every French parenting technique will appeal to everybody but at least it gives you great perspective. Read it out of curiosity, I think you will have fun.
B001RHOJSE|4.0|What impressed me most was how Eichman's trial brought a clear evidence on the banality of evil. In spite of the customary argument about blind obedience, his detailed statements about how he minimised the cost of killing people, about how proud he was  in contributing to his country's economy of war, etc is simply UNBELIEVABLE.<br />Mrs. Arendt was very succesful in raising the question on the banality of evil which affected the German people as a whole. Germans are so efficient in pursuing their objectives that they seldom raise questions on the origin of such objectives.<br />It is really amazing how this happened in the land of phylosophers ...
B0097EWK3A|4.0|I had a terrible time downloading this app but got it eventually and liked it enough to use up all my &#34;coins&#34; to get the extended version. Reminds me of The Curious Village (Professor Lathan?) on the DS.
B003UBTX7C|3.0|Baldacci turns out good reads and is a go to writer when wanting to get away from all of the data that bombards us daily.

1451696191|5.0|The general message that comes across in this book is really great. I would recommend this for anyone starting, or already in, high school and anyone after that. I'm 26 and the message of finding yourself and finding your &#34;people&#34; still resonated with me, though I feel the message would be a lot stronger for someone in/starting high school. It's also a pretty easy read - I was able to get through the bulk of it in one afternoon.
B000FCKIFU|3.0|Baldacci turns out good reads and is a go to writer when wanting to get away from all of the data that bombards us daily.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It is challenging and very good for young children.  Gets them to look at the whole picture.  I recommend it.
B00BVMXBDO|5.0|This moved very well. It revealed a lot each episode. Well written, directed, and acted. Enjoyed Felix and his relationship with Sarah very much.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book was really touching.  It taught me so many important lessons and showed me the true beauty in people.  Please read!  It's incredible and I rate it five stars.<br />I will never forget this book.<br />Love,<br />Frog 🐸
B00A8ECU24|4.0|It's a great game but it's always looking for money! It's really easy but fun. It has mini games so it can be fun there is a ball game a apple picking and a flying game.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|This book was magic from beginning to end.  I loved in imagery, and it will stay with me for a very long time.  I recommend it to all my reader friends...
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Bait, line and sinker. I can't stop reading these books!!! 1 down, 5 more to go. Cassandra Clare has created a monster.

140006922X|5.0|As &#34;historical&#34; as one can be about this mythological/iconic figure of our culture.<br />What you should know, what you didn't know and what you don't want to know about the places, people and events of first century Palestine.
B000J5XS3C|5.0|I am using it to mix my computers and ham radios--giving me great flexibility. Works very well for my needs.
B002RKSZS0|5.0|Satire on Gothic novels written with Jane Austen style and grace.. As always the good girl gets the man and lives happily ever after.
1781162646|3.0|This book was ok.  I bought it because of an interview I listened to on NPR.  It is one of his Stand By Me type stories, but not as good.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Received in our system quickly and made it through each episode with no technical probs. Wish I had Prime earlier so it would have been free.
B004EPZ06Q|1.0|Frankly, I'm embarrassed to have said that I've seen this film. Save yourself some time and just re-watch the first one if you really need to see these guys acting together again. Anything is better than this movie -- well perhaps, I haven't seen the third one yet..
B002SAUCBC|5.0|I Love Stephen King... This book kept me turning the pages to find out what was going to happen next.
140006922X|4.0|This book provides a very well researched and complete picture of the background in the first century Jerusalem, which allows the real Jesus to be portrayed with credibility. The only reason I did not give 5 stars is that I failed to see, after reading it, how the author justified his thesis, that he found the Jesus that is truly worth believing in. However, I now challenge the author to write the same kind of book on Mohammad, and preferably with his portrait on the cover as well. As an honest academic, He should be able to use the same objective attitude and approach to demystify another one of those prophets, or messiahs, or whatever god-like figures that you only get their descriptions from those holy books.
B005SFS4ZU|5.0|BOTH MY WIFE AND I LOVE IT! I HAVE HEARD IT 15-20 TIMES SINCE I RECEIVED IT.  MY WIFE IS LISTENING TO IT AS I RESPOND TO YOUR E-MAIL.  I FIND NO FSULTS WITH IT - NONE!
B0064X7FVE|3.0|Battery life it hogs. I liked the hourly forecast. Do not need the fancy graphics<br /> The maps are hard to deal with. The old version was easier to use.
B00CT2P6VA|4.0|Is challenging and engaging.<br />I especially like pushing the blocks around with the bubbles.every level is a little more of a challenge have fun.
1439152799|5.0|I do recommend that book, all the books from her are really good, if you havent read them, you should. book in good shape, and fair price
B001NLKXK2|5.0|The book held my attention. Found it moving and informative. The characters were so real, and consider that this is a family matter, so that was important. A must read for anyone with elderly parents or in need of information about Alzheimers. I have suggested it to many friends and my children.
1439152810|5.0|I do recommend that book, all the books from her are really good, if you havent read them, you should. book was in good shape, and at a fair price
B00BTV62KG|5.0|First time listening to John Scofield, and have enjoyed every track.  I will definitely be purchasing more of John's works.
B00526ZKYS|5.0|This book is excellent! Can't wait to read the next book in the series! Great story line of what could be a real reality in the future!
0316201545|5.0|It's like Chris is scanning my mind for remains of child brain which I thought was long lost. Love this series, can't wait for the third.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is in my top 5 games. This game is very fun if you like to create houses and monuments.
B005LAIHR2|5.0|Love this movie. I definitely think that Diego Boneta was a little too un-rock-ish to play Drew. Cory Monteith, in my opinion, would have been better. However, I did like him. Julianne Hough, Tom Cruise, Malin Akerman, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Alec Baldwin, and Russell Brand in one movie? I'm there.
B006H5120E|5.0|I saw the original when it came out but nothing compares to seeing it in 3-D. The lifelike images are awesome.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Very exciting game my kids love it and also myself dad a must play for individual family fun give it a try you won't be disappointed.
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|I thought it started off good, but hen got a little weird. I was hoping it was a more realistic book.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is very good and their creators did a great job! I love playing the subway surfers! I can't wait until the subway surfers have a another one!
B00ESY7QXI|5.0|Found the movie amazing in every way shape and form, such a powerful and beautiful movie utterly mesmerizing I already feel the need to watch it again
B00CF34B2I|5.0|I LOVE MTG. It's always fun and this game recreates the card game pretty well.  A few glitches here and there, but nothing that spoils it.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Horses respond well to love and work. Fun for a time filler and to help kids develop a pattern of caring and responsibility for animals.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game I have had a million horses and one of my horses passed away so this game was great for me to cope and when I am on the go I can play this and it helps not worry about my actual horses and helps with separation anxiety
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|i had heard a lot about this movie and how good it was. It was alright. I like the two of them together. The picture was good but i did have some minor streaming problems but that might have been an issue with my internet. Overall good.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This app is very fun but an expensive store. I recommend that most bronies and pegasister will enjoy (they even have Dr.Hooves instead of Time Turner) :D
B0024Y9EYS|5.0|I really enjoyed the 2 season series....it's a shame it didn't continue. being a writer of dubious fame, I do understand that  sometimes the series writers suffer from &#34;writers block&#34; and find it best to quit the series rather than subject it to plots that would diminish it  as well as their reputation! Time to re-start with a new creative staff....really....no harm no foul. The cast was excellent....the casting was excellent....I would prefer them to return....I know being in a certain genra for too long can get you &#34;locked in&#34; to that scene and limit you as an actor....but they were sooooo good in their roles!<br />I vote for a 3rd and 4th season....maybe some day.
B00DC3DGSK|3.0|While the playing by BG and singing are great the disc is produced with everything way to loud in the mix.It is fun to read which guitar the master is playing and the Memphis Horns are a welcome presence but where are the subtleties in the music. Bring back the old time production values where volume of instruments had there place in a mix. Its to bad so much music today is just turn it up to 10 as one tends to develop listener fatigue after a few cuts the music just becomes noise. I would rather listen to some of BG Chess recordings.
033044123X|2.0|Baldacci's work came highly recommended by friends who, like me, greatly enjoy Vince Flynn's work. After reading five page-turner political thrillers by Flynn in as many weeks, I decided to give Baldacci's Camel Club series a try. After 200 pages, I just found myself struggling to go page to page. The story just seems to languish and go nowhere fast. A third of the way through this type of book, the pace should quicken. It just doesn't seem to develop the intrigue and build the drama. The character development in particular seems to just meander about. Perhaps my expectations were too high, but I just can't muster the interest to finish it. I hate giving up on a book this far in, but the characters are flat and cliched, the plot drifts and the drama seems to have peaked in the early chapters.<br /><br />Going back now to finish the late Vince Flynn's Mitch Rapp series. Was hoping Baldacci's work would fill the void left by Flynn's untimely death. Unfortunately, that will not happen.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I can't remember when I've enjoyed a book so much! The story just kept unfolding to reveal new twists and turns. I loved all the characters and felt as if I knew them all.  Will definitely recommend to everyone.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Awesome show!  Great scenery and costumes!  Love the dowager countess!  Can't wait for season 4! Love the blue ray dvd's
1463707606|5.0|Beautiful book with great photographs. The instructions are clear and precise and I am half way to my first project. Great fun
B00697VQEC|5.0|Having grown up as a teenager in the early 1960's, the arrival of a new Beatles album was paramount to almost anything else, and Rubber Soul hit the ground in a way that set the gears in motion for what was to come. This US Capitol version of Rubber Soul I personally consider to be a work of art musically! I never tire of listening to it. To top it off to be able to buy such an early version that was distributed in 1965/66 through the Amazon seller Yuupdeals, well this was a treat! Thanks for a wonderful new addition to our Beatles collection Yuupdeals and Amazon!
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|This game has just enough variety to keep you wanting to play it.  I like the different styles of picture searches available.
B00AW57L96|5.0|Fantastic Read - hard to put this book down, just want to keep going to see what is happening and keeps you guessing.

B0000062FJ|5.0|I had the original vinyl record back in the early 70's.  Literally wore it out, so replacing it with the CD is a real plus.  The bonus tracks on the disc were also an added surprise!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|It get more intense as you read this book!  Highly recommended to read from the start to understand the story in this book.
B00EOO55GW|3.0|Short review: Not great, okay to pass the time. So far I have found their best effort to be \\"Avenged Sevenfold\\" and this album isn't anywhere near as inspired. In fact, it seems pretty derivative of earlier works, including such acts as Black Label Society and Black Sabbath.<br /><br />Just meh..
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Favorite Movie! Fantastic cast and script! I would recommend to anyone and everyone!  LOVE THIS MOVIE! Rent/buy it, because it is a must see.
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|The movie, &#34;Quartet&#34; is very good and a happy movie, unlike &#34;Amore&#34;. Both movies are ok for persons over 65, for different reasons. Quartet is how life should be lived, Amore is how is sometimes pans out. We loved it, enough to watch is several times the first week. Maggie Smith is a fun match for the character. She has really been on a roll of late.
B008KNUKVI|5.0|Awesome! As always, Pentatonix harmony is extreme and tight as ever!  So glad to hear new songs and can't wait for more!
0763619612|5.0|I adore this book! The colors are great, and the simplicity and white background make it pop without being overwhelming. The message is fantastic, encouraging children to try. So many people, adults included, think they have no talent. This book encourages you to look again.
B00CB4ET0K|5.0|Great game. Get it. It's for people who like a classic world war two game. It takes a while to get money and buy stuff. But it's a great game
0440237688|4.0|I love this book! I think it is better suited for older children than for 8 year old children, as suggested on Amazon, but then again there isn't anything in here that they haven't seen on TV or heard of before. It is a utopia book, which a lot of people just don't care for, but I love them. It's a great way for children to understand that sometimes bad things happen, and that's ok. The ending did disappoint me the first time I read it, but I think that's the point. Life doesn't always have happy endings, and many questions will always be unanswerable. I say give it a try, and if you don't like it, well, you're not going to love every book you read.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|I like this application simple easy- to-use does its job very well since the discovery my kindle always efficient this application should not miss advise everyone to try it.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This book is the book of all books and speaks for itself.  If you need to understand God, I say, READ IT! Take it to heart.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|Awesome game one of the best especially for free no doubt it gets 5*s only suggestion make leveling any acquiring gold just a lol bit faster
B004J4WKUQ|3.0|Was expecting the book to be driven more by 1980's pop-culture, but it was really more of a future Internet sci-fi kind of book, that I don't care for. The 80's references felt more forced and crammed together. It was interesting, but not what I was expecting or hoping for.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Great graphics  fun game for horse lovers you get to take care of and train your very own horse and enter competitions
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I do really enjoy Bingo Blitz. However on my Kindle, connectivity is often an issue. Overall though, I love it.
B004JN1CW4|4.0|It was a quick read with a satisfactory ending that tied up all the loose ends and left me hopeful for the survivors future.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|Love this game. Appeased my competitive nature. My family and I play against each other every day. It's a game worth having.

B009KS4XRO|5.0|This is a fun game to play. It is the best bingo game on the Kindle I've ever found. I play it all the time.
B00640UICA|4.0|Granddaughter loves playing this game and it is very good for puzzle solving skills.<br />I am glad there are games like this so youngsters can learn.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Best app ever!!! I love that anything you're interested in is available. I have dozens of recipes. The fitness and  workout pins can be very informative.
B0060V1WJ6|5.0|5 stars for Ryan Gosling shirtless! The storyline was pretty good too. Would definitely recommend to a friend. Did I forget to mention Ryan Gosling is shirtless in this film?!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Kids love it and so do I.  Hours of fun for everyone.  Can't get enough.<br />My 9 year-old and my 50year old husband love it.
B006S08RLU|1.0|I'm amazed that anyone liked this film, let alone loved it. Admittedly it did have some cute moments, but as a whole it was odd and boring. Odd and quirky movies can be very entertaining and enjoyable, but this one, IMHO, missed the mark by a country mile. I do not recommend it.
B008XKSW7M|5.0|Loved the cast, storyline & intermingling of the characters. Also loved that although it was perfect ending for all, it wasn't unrealistic
B005CRQ4XI|2.0|I love real,life adventure books.  I have a whole  library of them from climbing mountains to cycling round the world, Hiking the PCT and the Appalachian trail.  All of the, have one theme.  The people who do them are prepared and and have at least BASIC knowledge of what they are doing.  Even the mis-adventures are usually figured out on their own.<br /><br />Then we meet Cheryl.  Never put on her pack or wore herboots before.  No trekking poles, but plenty of condoms, can't figure out how to use her stove (unleaded gas, really?) and the only reason she makes it is that she is cute and female, so real hikers along the way help her out.  they even gave her ice axe lessons, then se left it behind.<br /><br />I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 stars because she did make it farther than I have ever hiked, and she was smart enough to bring duct tape, which saves her after her boots fly off a mountain.  (How do you lose boots?). There was a time I was hoping a bear would eat her, but no such luck.<br /><br />This was my first Oprah list book, and probably my last.
B00A0NOF7G|2.0|The price is too high for such a short read. Storyline had potential but very short on details. Very obvious ending - no mystery to this book at all. I have read children's books that are longer and have more detailed characters as well as a real story. Disappointing because it could have been a lot better.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|If Shakespeare was alive, this is the series he would write for. Great characters and intelligent dialogue. There is something wonderfully rotten in the Seven Kingdoms.
B001VLXNLU|5.0|I have read this book a few times and it is always just as good! The whole series is great! I love the whole House of Night world!
0767919408|5.0|I swear, only Bill Bryson could pull this off.  He rambles over 500 pages about Herbert Hoover's ego, Henry Ford's megalomania, Charles Lindbergh's transatlantic flight, Lou Gehrig's maternal devotion, Albert Snyder's gruesome end, Babe Ruth's home-run record, and vastly more - and manages at every turn to keep you wanting to pick up the book and keep reading!  I found myself laughing out loud, emailing trivia to friends (did you know Henry Ford invented charcoal briquettes?), crying as I read about a slaughter of schoolchildren that has never been equaled, and marveling as Bryson connected  Henry Wickham's failed tropical farming career to the Ford Motor Company's assembly line, Prohibition to government-condoned arsenic poisonings, night classes at UCLA to the fall of Al Capone, and many, many more events that improbably, yet actually, came together one summer in America, 1927.<br /><br />Although I read a lot, I'm not a big reader of history, even less so of books that want me to read 500+ pages of it in a single volume.  I selected this book only because Bill Bryson was the author, leading me to suspect it might be both readable and likeable.  Ten years ago, my brother-in-law handed me \\"A Walk in the Woods\\" and insisted I had to read it.  This summer, \\"One Summer:  America, 1927\\" is the book I've similarly thrust on all my friends:  \\"You've got to read this!\\"
B0028MBKVG|5.0|Great novel, highly recommend for anyone - even those who don't consider themselves runners! Changed my philosophy on the sport.
1603425381|5.0|I make baby blankets for charities all year every year and have done for over 40 years. I am a designer, too. Now, I can combine my baby blanket patterns with a wide variety of borders. The possibilities are endless! The book is an odd size and heavy for its size, which is the only drawback. I also knit and crochet sweaters, shawls, and other items for various charities. I will use the border patterns in this book on those items, too. You might also like Nicky Epstein's book &#34;Crocheting on the Edge.&#34; I have both books in my library as references for my own designing. I highly recommend both books.
B00ESY77LO|2.0|DeCaprio made a tiresome Gatsby.  Didn't even watch this to the end .... boring.  Disappointed in the casting of Daisy.  All in all, poor acting (part belongs to a yawn of a script) and cast choice.
B008JFUO4U|3.0|While Oblivion had some impressive graphics and filming the storyline was lacking. The movie was very slow and I was expecting a little more action for the way the movie was advertised. Morgan Freeman was pretty much non-existing in the whole movie except for about 2 minutes. It would have been nice to added some more background material about the surviors and the past leading up to the present time of the story. Wasn't much character development at all for any of the major players in the movie. This movie was much hyped and I honestly was let down by the slow pace. Okay movie but I probably would have been better off renting it rather than owning it.
B0046B1KHG|5.0|This was a very funny movie, there were many inferences in the scenes just for adults.  The entire family will enjoy this film.
006085412X|4.0|I did not realize just how huge this book would be.  It's about a foot tall.  Love that it's a board book.  Great message and my toddler son really likes it.  Wish it didn't say things like...The baby's too little to eat pizza and ice cream.  it's fun being big, I can eat pizza and ice cream!  Maybe that wouldn't bother most people, but it's not something I wanted to promote with this message.  Other than that, it's a great book for a toddler on the topic.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Enjoyed playing. Never used real money. Lots of different puzzles, and reasonable life recharging time. Will buy more games like this in the future.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|This is when we need an option of a 10-star rating because a 5-star rating just simply is nowhere near enough.<br /><br />Ok, so I purchased this book just under a year ago.  I read it cover to cover in less than 2 days and when I was done, I started at the beginning and read it a second time.  Since then, I have read it 5 more times and will read it again (and again) whenever I find myself needing inspiration, a renewal of faith, a good cry or when I want to be reminded of what a true hero is all about.  Those are just a few of the many things you will experience as you read the story of Adam Brown's life.<br /><br />It doesn't take long to see that Mr. Brown was truly one-of-a-kind and so having the opportunity to \\"meet\\" him through the words of his family, friends and fellow SEALS, was a blessing I was certainly not expecting.  The way that Mr. Brown dealt with the ups and downs, the way he defeated the seemingly endless heartbreaking struggles and the way he tackled the mountainous obstacles that continually tried to break him, will make you realize that with dedication, drive and determination, there is absolutely nothing in this world that you can not do or become.  Quite honestly, I feel every single high school senior should be given a copy of this book along with their diploma, because nothing that is taught in any classroom or read in any textbook can even come close to the lessons that can be learned from Adam Brown.<br /><br />In addition, I found myself absolutely captivated by the manner in which Mr. Blehm tells a story. This is the first book of Mr. Blehm's that I've read, but it certainly will not be the last.  By default, I'm not a fan of an excessive amount of unnecessary information when it comes to non-fiction.  I get very bored, very easily if I feel too much of what I am reading is bogged down with minutia. One of the things I completely adore about Mr. Blehm's style of writing, is that he has an astounding (and rare) way of packing soooo much into soooo little, without missing a single thing.  He clearly puts incredible amounts of thought not only into every sentence, but into each word.  I feel he is easily one of the most gifted writers I have come across.  So much so, each time I finish reading this book, I find myself wishing it would go on forever.  He is just that good.<br /><br />As a side note, if you've put off reading this because you aren't typically interested in war / combat / military-based books, you should know that Mr. Brown's military career is far from being the main focus of FEARLESS - it really made up just a small part of this absolutely incredibly amazing, yet humble man.  Adam Brown was a warrior long before he became a SEAL and he was a hero long before he gave his life for what he believed in.into soooo little, without missing a single thing.

B001KZG99A|5.0|Robert Downey, Jr would have been one of the last actors I would have thought about when thinking about a superhero roll....but he really pulled it off.  His character, Stark,  was tough, and funny, and it's good to see that after all his earlier problems he's doing so well in the movies.  The humor in this show really was great, especially between him and his robot, Dummy, gets even better when he's trading remarks with people.
1781162646|5.0|'Joyland' is Stephen King at his nostalgic best -- invoking America's past, both light and shadows.  Like no other, King masters the art of bringing characters to life to an extent that the reader feels like he has been friends with them all his life.  But the true feat that he accomplishes is to conjure up archetypical images that will resonate with most of us:  long summers close to nature, the smells and impressions of carnivals on hot August nights, the bittersweet feelings of summer giving way to a cooler and darker autumn.  King is rarely about the actual plot (which is decent, but not outstanding) -- he is about leading the reader into a strange and yet familiar world.  While I was first annoyed that this book was not released as an ebook, I now applaud his decision -- this book was written to be a paperback, in and of itself a nod to a simpler past.
B00D6BN9NK|4.0|Bruce Willis even though he's getting up there in age, still has what it takes to do action movies.  I enjoy his John McClane  (sp) character and all the chaos that surrounds him.  The car destruction scenes in this movie are over the top...to the point were you go from Wow...to ok..they'll stop anytime...to Wow...they're still wrecking them!!!!!  Kind of cool if you enjoy seeing about every conceivable way for a car to be destroyed.  The storyline was ok, but I figured out 'who did it' about half way through....didn't spoil the movie for me though.  I watch Die Hard movies more for the action adventure more than I did a strong story line.

B001KVZ6FW|4.0|All the factors that make Pixar the best of the computer animation studios are present in UP. Not only do they produce the highest quality animation but they consistently produce the most sympathetic and believable characters. Although it's true to say that all the obvious buttons are pushed here no one does it quite like Pixar, and a touching story about love and loss becomes truly life-affirming in their hands. The casting and voice acting are first rate, as one would expect, and the story is inventive and compelling. UP is poignant but also funny, and provides classic all-round family entertainment.

0307887898|4.0|The author clearly knows his stuff, and he's onto something here.  He's a successful startup artist, but he's no writer.  Still, if you pause to re-read many sections, the book will make sense in the end.<br /><br />Others have pointed out that the lessons are largely about software and internet enterprises, but may have wider applicability.  And the author's articulated philosophy of &#34;Build, Measure, Learn&#34; is widely applicable in many product/service startups.  Unfortunately, the author's recommended methodology presumes that whatever you're doing will involve hundreds or thousands of &#34;early adopter&#34; customers, whose reactions you can analyze and use to continuously re-work your Minimum Viable Product.  In the B2B world, that most often is not the case.  And the smaller the sample size, the more likely that any given customer's reactions will fail to be indicative of &#34;the typical user&#34; - if there even is such a thing for your product/service.<br /><br />If you're developing online games or a social product that millions of end-users will use to &#34;make new friends,&#34; the author's philosophy and methods may well be the best way to find success.  If you play in the world of enterprise-class business applications... not so much.<br /><br />Still, I recommend reading the book.  It's not a smooth read, but you should be able to come away with enough to make your investment of time and money worthwhile.

B004DLPXAO|1.0|My 1 star rating is specifically for version 4.2.0 on android 2.3.4, since it won't install, and is over 20Mbytes.<br /><br />Kindle reader 4.2.0 would not download to my android 2.3.4 phone after an uninstall of my older version in which the dictionary stopped working recently.<br /><br />Since there was no official way to download an older version, I took the chance of trying the freeware site, and am just hoping I have not put malware on my phone.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />I installed version 3.1.0.30 on my phone, which is under 5Mb.<br /><br />It does work, although it seems to be the earliest version I used (from early 2012), and does not quite have all the same viewing options (e.g. margins control) as were available later after some updates.<br /><br />There are other versions on that site, but that is the only one I have tried so far.<br /><br />It's a shame that Amazon does not provide a safe way to download older versions, since the updates are not universally working (and have not been according to comments since at least Dec 2012)<br /><br />Good luck.

B007SAKY42|2.0|This review is specific to the vinyl edition. I am sorry I bought this as a box, the individual albums seem to be available on vinyl at a much, much cheaper cost, the same versions. The box the set comes in is not that nice, and not worth the huge premium. it is an ordinary slipcase box, nothing special. And there is no insert, no booklet. It is just the albums. So please consider just getting the individual albums if you want them on vinyl. You won't be missing much, and will save a lot of money.<br /><br />Also, the download codes for the bonus tracks are technically expired as of Aug 1 2013, though they may still work.<br /><br />So far i have listened to 13 and The Great Escape. 13 has fantastic audiophile quality. TGE lacks the incredible detail but is still preferable soundwise to my old cd.<br /><br />I'm really enjoying the music but in hindsight the vinyl box is a silly purchase. The cd box looks pretty awesome, but I prefer vinyl sound. But the vinyl set lacks the features of the cd set. Do they expect the vinyl lovers to purchase both sets for the extras? Anyway, I highly recommend avoiding this set, just because the individual albums are so much cheaper and the box version adds nothing to them but a flimsy slipcase.

B007ZXK08C|4.0|The book engaged my curiosity from the beginning and continued to provide plenty of room for the imagination to consider various options and scenarios for 'the crime' as it moved along.  The characters reflections and insights on their relationship were believable and added depth to a mystery plot. A very enjoyable read.

B000002J1O|4.0|After a quickly made live album (their best for nearly 30 years), Genesis went to Headley Grange castle to record their follow up to their 1972 masterpiece Foxtrot. What came out of those sessions is often cited as their greatest effort. I disagree, as no Genesis album could be their best without Supper's Ready, but for what the album is, it is still a masterpiece of a different sort.<br /><br />Perhaps Selling England's greatest legacy is in the music itself.  I think this album features the greatest instrumental work of Genesis from any era. Tony Banks in particular delivers an exceptional performance that showed what a true genius he was on the keyboard. Unfortunately the instrumental passages of the songs do sometimes act as little more than a cover for the album's greatest problem: the lyrics (or lack thereof). It is true that the band members were all suffering from writer's block at the time, and unlike some of their earlier work, none of the lyrics can be cited as \\"bad\\". But when compared to lyrics found on Foxtrot, Nursery Cryme, and to a certain extent Trespass, they are either lacking substance or are not present in appropriate quantities.<br /><br />Some of the songs are perhaps better served by this, most noticeably the short, silly and ridiculously catchy I Know What I Like (in Your Wardrobe). As mentioned, the lacking lyrics can be overlooked by the beautiful instrumental work. The first three songs in particular are great evidence of the latter. Dancing with the Moonlit Knight is the hardest hitting song on the album, even though its lyrics don't really make a whole lot of sense when you look at them. A Firth of Fifth almost feels like it could have no lyrics, and it would still be the masterpiece of a song that it is. I even like the lyrics to the often hated More Fool Me, which I think was Phil Colin's real shining moment in pre-pop Genesis.<br /><br />It's when the album hits the longer songs that it runs into trouble. Certainly the worst song inmy opinion is the Battle of Epping Forest. This song suffers from far too many lyrics, telling a complicated, convuluted (and apparently true) story about a gang battle in the aforementioned Epping Forest. Of course, had it not had as many lyrics it probably wouldn't have been a good song anyway as the instrumentals are second rate, at best. The followup Cinema Show suffers from the opposite problem: it has far too many instrumental parts (which are very good granted) and far too few lyrics. It's a piece that drags on too long, and it certainly feels like it.<br /><br />That being said, the problems with Selling England By the Pound are not enough to bring it down. Though I have reservations about it, and it's probably my least favorite post Foxtrot Genesis album, it's still a classic, and still worth a purchase.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I was really excited to read this book based on my love of Hosseini's other books. It did not however live up to my expectations. It was hard to follow some times as it kept jumping around, too many characters with a choppy plot. IHosseini's is a great storyteller so I did enjoy the book for the most part.

B000002PC6|3.0|First off I was a fan of the Have You Never Been Mellow soft rock country Olivia Newton-John.  But I like everybody else bought this when it came out.  I didn't really like this album that much.  It was too over the top.  But I've read in other reviews how this kind of started the fitness craze.  Well in the video she is in a gym working out.  But does anybody really need to be told what the song Physical is really about.  Lets Get Into Physical.  Lets Get Into Vertical.  So anyway the last song on the cd The Dolphin Song is my favorite song on here.  She seems to be singing from the heart.  Also Make A Move On Me.  This album and that song put her career into another level.  I didn't keep up with her much after this.  I'll take early Olivia anytime.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book, can't wait to see what happens next. Finished the book in one full day. Story line was somewhat disturbing but when reading it wasn't as bad as I thought.

B00AKKS278|4.0|Is this book going to change your life? Maybe, but that's mostly going to depend on you. I'm sure other reviewers have said as much already, but it really is true.<br /><br />Hal Elrod has managed to write a fairly engaging book about the benefits of waking up early, and how to harness your mornings to make miracles (in regards to changing yourself). He does this through a system(s) that employs familiar, kinda tacky acronyms. It's an eclectic assortment of rituals that will supposedly super-charge the rest of your day. The activities he advocates like meditation, writing, or physical exercise are all great ways to start off your morning. But, you don't need this book to tell you that. I just did. There are plenty of resources and articles about what you can do in the mornings or throughout the day to better yourself.<br /><br />This book is for those looking for a tangible system to follow. Of the self-help books out there, Elrod's is definitely one of the more concrete. He gives you the things to do, when to do them, how to do them, and in what order. Online resources and articles will tell you what to do, but likely not how to specifically apply it in your life. That's up to you to figure out. Now, that's not too difficult, but some people don't have any luck with it.<br /><br />Elrod's book is an instruction manual in that regard.  If you follow his advice, you'll see results. Maybe not miraculous results, but results none the less.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is a great game for all ages. This is the first game I play out of all my games. Truly the best game ever.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This is the story of a black lawyer who hates authority in general and the FBI in particular, because he has been heavily condemned for a crime he did not commit. He should just have had a warning to be more careful with the money transfers of his clients but he was condemned to ten years. Now he is planning his revenge.<br />The mood is lighter than in other Grisham's books. But the author's search for justice is the same: it is always interesting to follow his quest for \\"the right thing.\\" Contrary to the other books, the hero here is looking for money, but one cannot do the trip without paying attention to his comments on the justice system, the prison system and the way black people are still treated.<br />I loved this book, but my favorite still is [[ASIN:0440245923 The Firm: A Novel]].<br />It is cracking to analyze the differences between the novel and the movie (the film promotes a Hollywood morality far from the Southern's ethics of Grisham): [[ASIN:B002NIJWVU The Firm]].

Following up on Ender's Game, Speaker for the Dead picks up with Ender back in the action, having lived a life of repudiation of  his actions to commit xenocide and  helping those who need someone to speak for them.  Engaging and thought provoking.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|I like this game a lot.  all I can say is I like the adventure games better than just the hidden object games.  I do like some of the other games from big fish a little more though.  otherwise I would recommend this to others.

B00EE3FVSU|4.0|The Danish started this trend to slow and moody. Broadchurch joins the trend, is strong in characters, good writing, but short on emotion. You feel that the story is looking at itself, as if preening in its own excellence.
B00CPTUN5G|5.0|After watching this online, I elected to purchase the film on DVD. The bonus features alone were worth it - the songs are a lot of fun and there is a karaoke bonus feature. There are also some behind-the-scene things.<br />The movie itself surprised me. As a MLP fan, I was hesitant when this film came out about how throwing the ponies into a human-like setting would turn out. As it so happens it's not that bad. This was a great addition to my movie library.
B00846F1YW|5.0|Fun puzzles in addition to the hidden items to be found. The story was not obvious, so it kept me engaged.<br />For the second time around,  I would like to skip the dialogue for the entire game, not just one section.

B00ECU2RGY|5.0|While I'm always reluctant to like a Tom Cruise movie, Oblivion is an extremely well-made, psychological thriller that ranks among the best films I have seen this year.  Set in the year 2077 after Earth has become uninhabitable, Oblivion is visually stunning and has a compelling plot line that held my interest throughout the entire 2-hour drama.  I was also pleasantly surprised by the very limited amount of violence and strong language, since our 6-year old daughter decided to join us on the couch for most of the movie.  All in all, this HD rental was well worth the price and a film I would highly recommend to just about anyone.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|This is near to perfection, Love this keyboard. Thanks for the development, i'll totally recommend,it to all my android user friends
145162607X|5.0|This Gregory book goes back to the fascinating storytelling of Philippa Gregory. The two previous books were boring, but the author is back in top form with this book and her newest.
B005HSG3U6|4.0|For the price, this case is a good deal. My kindle fits great inside and I feel confident it would be protected from any normal drops. My previous case, (the cheapest case that I could find.) worked ok, but the case covered to much of the display and made it difficult to open the menu. There is no problem with that with this case as it snaps easily over the edge and give you full use of the screen.<br /><br />While this case does allow you to use the cover as a stand, and it works great on a hard surface such as a table, it is not nearly as sturdy on softer things like a couch or a bed. My two year old can easily knock this over and half of the time I end up propping it up against a pillow.<br /><br />The cover generally stays closed when carrying it around and if you want to ensure the cover is closed, the strap works great.<br /><br />I think the white looks great but I can already tell that it will need a regular cleaning to stay that way.<br /><br />Overall, If you want a good case that will hold up to most of your daily use and don't want to spend a ton of money, this is a very good option.
B00ECUARO8|4.0|Good acting, good albeit a little familiar in theme. Glad my kids weren't pulling the wool over my eyes like that about anyone (I hope)!
B006IMY5ZU|4.0|Good movie, but better book.  Movie keeps true to the book pretty well though.  Brad Pitt is a believable Billy Beane
B002KQ6BT6|3.0|Mr. Brown had a good plot  but lost me with too much repetitive explanations and preaching.<br />He could have told the story  much more succinctly. I was past ready to be done with the book unfortunately.
B00DYEN5QU|3.0|I was disappointed by the movie and did look forward to its release in theaters. I thought they brought together an awesome cast. My problems with the movie stem from its lack of a cohesive structure, in other words they did a poor job in story telling. I think they had the right idea in presenting the material as aliens have landed but produced a crappy script. The dialog was horrible and it was basically all nonstop action. It begins with a slugfest on Krypton between Jor-el and Zod. Then it goes from Krypton to a ship/oilrig disaster with a grown up Clark saving the day. What happened to his childhood on earth? That was thrown in with flashbacks in between an adult Clark helping and coming to terms with his powers, alla Smallville. Then Zod and company arrives and they start destroying planet. Very poorly put together! The movie would have been much better had they turned to a professional novelist to pen the script as the producers of the classic Christopher Reeve movie did. Had they done so they could have captured the difficulties, humanity and passion of the the character. Instead they focussed solely on the action and special effects. I also would have chosen a different director maybe Steven Spielberg, or Peter Jackson. If you don't care about the story and are just looking to see super powered muscle men pummel each other than this movie is for you.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I enjoyed his last two books as well.  I have not completed reading the book yet but not that far from the end.
B0036FYO12|5.0|One of the best spy movies from the cold war.  Although the researcher types would have never survived, Redford makes you believe that he is unpredictable enough to win in the end.
B008EEZ64Y|3.0|Interesting read. I thought it curious how the ending was left to the readers own interpretation. Quite thought-provoking in my opinion.
B0026KX6TY|5.0|I love chess and competition.  This movies helps you realize it's a real gift to play something that doesn't require a ball too. It also plays to adults learning how to relate to their kids in a healthy way.
B00CHS31DG|5.0|I love this app. I purchased the first Ghost Radar not to hunt, but because my family has had a history of paranormal experiences , which has made us open to, and curious about, this world we live in. Rather than searching for ghosts, I turn the radar on , sit quietly, and see what comes through. With each version of the app, each family member has had amazing results. This does not mean that every session results in a connection, and that is the way it should be because whatever one's belief system, one should not expect performance on demand. Also, I don't look at random words and attempt to make them mean something. We have had very specific names and words that relate to current events, or to people we should check up on. It doesn't seem to matter that we're using different devices, the same family name will sometimes appear on each device around the same time. All versions of Ghost Radar come with a list of words and names, but this latest version allows you to add words to the vocabulary. However this app works, it has been very life-affirming for us. Non-believers can attempt to debunk this app for a very small amount of money, however the developer makes no promises nor attempts to sway anyone's mind.
B005XUC398|4.0|Although they never really get into why the investments are bad, the acting is good and the plot is believable.

Well I saw that Behringer had a small USB mixer. (Xenyx 302USB) with 5 inputs. Mcrophone XLR/ 1/4&#34; input.  A line in (RCA) and a 2 track input (RCA). Main Mix output also (RCA). 1/8 jack headphone with a Volume control. The main mix has it's own volume control also.<br /><br />You have a gain control for the microphone input plus  Pan & EQ. The line input has a volume control also with Pan & EQ  There are two switches one for line in or computer in. Second switch is to select Headphone or main mix.<br /><br />I Just hooked it to the computer and it loads the driver software.  Comes with a power supply, but it will power up by the computers USB cable. Went on line to Behringer.com and clicked on support, then Xenyx and down loaded the software for Audacity.<br /><br />Hooked my MP3 player to it by the line input, Recorded, and saved to a MP3 file. Sample and easy.

B00E978FGQ|4.0|Now You See Me, the hit caper thriller from [[ASIN:B001LM1456 Louis Leterrier]], and serves up the most fast-paced, glitzy, action-packed, twisty-turny, fun, crowd-pleasing cocktail imaginable...but forgets to make any of it make sense. The CONS of Now You See Me, and then PROS are conjured up by me below. AlakaZAM! Let us begin.<br /><br />CONS:  Breezy fun as it might be, when the movie tries to be serious it fails miserably. When the movie races at fast-pace, giving us sleight of hand, impossible feats of magic, and witty banter, all is fine and dandy. When Now You See Me tries to explain itself logically, it comes off as trying too hard. As Michael Caine says in The Prestige, we _want to be fooled. But we don't want to be cheated, and the admittedly unforseen twist ending was shocking for one breathless second, until we realized how extraordinarily unlikely, impossible, and silly it actually was. And also, the use of CGI for magic is a dubious choice. When we know what we are seeing onscreen was generated by computers and some greenscreen, it's harder to feel amazed and awed by the spectacular tricks.<br /><br />PROS: But hey, I'm taking this too seriously! NYSM is the perfect film for a night of carefree entertainment. Now You See Me combines healthy doses of action, humour, twists and turns, suspense, and a fresh sense of fun to make one of the rare original but engaging blockbusters out this year. It's no wonder Now You See Me was a surprise hit, outgrossing The Lone Ranger and Pacific Rim in the States.<br /><br />It's success is due in no small part to it's talented and diverse cast. [[ASIN:B004HWT6DO Jesse Eisenberg]] plays smug, difficult know-it-alls like he was born to, and his illusionist J. Daniel Atlas is right on the money. [[ASIN:B000HL093A Woody Harrelson]]'s obnoxious mentalist Merritt is one of the highlights of the film. In the supporting cast, Isla Fisher shows her talent and charm and Dave Franco is charming and cool as a pickpocketing magician.  [[ASIN:B008NCSZQ8 Mark Ruffalo]] has little to do but look confused and be ten steps behind everything else, but his final twist gives him some gravity, and he's got most of the funny bits. Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine are woefully underused. Not once did Caine ask if we were watching closely. But Caine is a remarkably suave gent, and Freeman makes every movie he's in 33.33% better. Quote me on that.<br /><br />By no accounts a truly GREAT film, Now You See Me successfully treads the thin line between silly and utterly entertaining by welcoming and embracing it's own silliness straight out of the door. You should even have such a great time that you forget that the plot is nonsensical and the twist at the end makes no sense. So come in close, because the more you actually see, the easier it will be...to have a great time at the movies.<br /><br />My rating? 4 of hearts out of 5.an.

It's fast pace. Now You See Me relentlessly takes us to new places, new tricks, new heists. You'd be hard pressed to find a dull moment in this film. The screenplay zips along at a fast pace, while FBI and illusionists play a mental game of cat-and-mouse. If we're not seeing billion dollar heists, we're watching mind games and card tricks, laughing at the befuddlement of the FBI, or trying to figure out how they DID that? I mentioned the CGI earlier in a disparaging tone, but the look of the film is spectacular. Glitzy, flashy lighting, slick cinematography, great costumes, and amazing feats of magic come to vivid life along with witty humor, intriguing suspense, and sharp dialogue. Now You See Me is a rare original blockbuster in a world of franchises, sequels, prequels, and reboots.<br /><br />It's also somewhat smart and really very fun (and funny!), provided you suspend your disbelief and leave your noggin at the door.<br /><br />...<br /><br />Now You See Me is by no accounts a truly GREAT film, but it successfully trods the thin line between silly and utterly entertaining by welcoming and embracing it's own silliness straight out of the door.

B00422LESO|5.0|Being a huge Austenite myself, I enjoyed this modern day story of a woman's chance to live inside a Jane Austen fantasy. Throughout the read, I had wished there was truly a place like Austenland, lol! This was just what I needed to read for relaxation, especially after revising my own book.
B009R659L8|3.0|This was an improvement over recent MHC novels but nowhere near the quality of her early work. Unlike some reviewers, I was not bothered by the multitude of characters but it certainly contributed to a lack of character development. Everyone seemed to fit a preconceived role - the victim, the sister, the distraught wife, the cop, the friend, the potential love interest and, of course, a select group of possible bad guys who (as any reader could figure out) were actually the bad guys. While I didn't learn much about the motivations of any one of these characters, I was, at least, was interested enough to keep reading this book to its conclusion.<br /><br />Since there was little question as to who the bad guys were, it was their roles, their actions and their complicity that provided the suspense. Overall, it was an intriguing story, particularly how all of the disparate crimes were pulled together. However, having the main bad guy describe all of his crimes thru an internal dialogue was disappointing. (Still don't quite understand why he did what he did.) Surely there was a better way to provide that reveal.<br /><br />At least the cops and the private detectives were competent, unlike some of her more recent novels. Her heroine(s)were not particularly interesting, likeable but rather dull and didn't really contribute to the advancement of the plot. MHC continues to feel the need to provide out-of-the blue romantic interests for her main female characters that have nothing to do with the plot and, in this instance, detract from it because of the overload of characters. Her continued reliance on certain expressions/habits wears thin: wearing slacks, eating sandwiches.<br /><br />I try to keep MHC's novels in perspective - not great literature just easy reads to pass the time.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|What can possibly be seen through the eyes of a seven your old child?<br /><br />Neil Gaiman's &#34;The Ocean at the End of the Lane&#34; will answer that question and astonish you. There's a sense that he is navigating through tidal forces of good versus evil, compassion versus indifference, existential terror versus the rock of safety, entropy versus syntropy, mundane versus magical, and many other bipolarities. At the very same time, this is an adventure yarn written with a particularity that makes it as real as your grandmother telling you a story at bedtime. There are three women in this book, each of a different generation. There is a pointed absence of men in their lives. Maybe they are witches, maybe they are not. There is a young boy whose parents have fallen into financial difficulty. He is a boy for whom books are more real than everyday life. There is an evil governess.  There are &#34;fleas&#34; and &#34;varmints&#34; unlike any you have seen before.  All of this is rendered in clear, limpid, evocative prose.  For my money this is Neil Gaiman's best book to date. Read it before you give it to your child. If your child is old enough to begin understanding that life is risk as well as reward, then your child is old enough to read it.
B005MMYPIE|3.0|When I first heard samples, I thoroughly enjoyed the band.<br />The instruments had good melodic metal hooks and the male and female singers sounded great.<br />I've enjoyed a few metal bands that threw in a screamo \\"singer\\" now and then, but it was usually in moderation. Since I really liked the other voices in this band, I thought I would be able to overlook an occasional growl.<br />I was wrong.<br />The screamer ruins an otherwise great album.<br />Mainly because the growls were not merely occasional.<br />He has equal amounts of lyrics as each of the other singers and after a few songs his growls begin to grate on my nerves.<br />I respect the effort to blend the two styles of metal, but I'm afraid it diminishes the talents of everyone involved.<br />Screamo fans will probably find the normal voices too \\"Popish\\" and mainstream (just as I find the screams too noisy and distracting)and write off this group.<br />I think it will come back and hurt the band as a whole.<br />If they continue trying to straddle the fence, It will probably fail to please either side.<br />I bought both this album and Nexus at the same time and tried to like them but to listen to the whole album was a chore, solely because of the screams.<br />I'm afraid I will only buy future Amaranthe CDs if they do away with, or greatly reduce, the screaming.<br />I truly hope they do- I really like the rest of the package.
B0087GZ8YW|4.0|After a lifetime of booze, bad meat pies, and cigarettes, it is a minor miracle that Detective John Rebus has survived to retirement age. If you have followed the career of Rebus you will already know that languishing as a volunteer in the Cold Cases office will not do. Then Rebus encounters a woman whose daughter was abducted years ago, and believes that other similar cases  are linked. This puts Rebus on the track of a serial killer. You just know that he will not be able to give up. Ian Rankin renders the tale with his usual clear prose, prose that may have an elegiac tone.  Rebus solves the crime, making both friends and enemies along the way.  But will he survive to solve another?  I do not read publishing news, so I do not know.  Rankin may have plans one way or another, but Rebus is clearly out of control, and will have his own mind on the matter.  This is one of Rankin's best Rebus tales. I recommend that you do not miss it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a very cute game and lots of fun.  My kids and I really enjoy playing it.  Just a lot of fun since we love th he minions.
B008K6HN8I|4.0|Liked it very much and really helps when needed. Needed for any rooted device.ES File Explorer is Recommended to everyone.
B000OLROWC|5.0|The best out of all The Karate Kid movies. Indeed it is, quote from the movie. Even if you decide not to watch any other Karate Kid movies this is the best of them.
B008476HBM|5.0|I chose to read this novel because I felt it obligatory to read a classic piece of literature. However, I was surprised by how engaging and thought-provoking it actually was! Read it for Austen' s mastery of the English language; read it for the love story and drama; read it for the character development; read it because it is so readable, accessible and beautiful in every way.
0062238868|4.0|I would have rated this book 5 full stars except that the profanity, limited though it was, did not add anything of value. The book was otherwise a great read and hard to put down.  He was truly an American Hero and I'm sure many would not be alive today whould it not be for his service in the middle east.  I would like to read his last (completely different) book someday as well.
B00BCZU8WM|4.0|Bought it just for mirrors, but there are some good songs on this CD.  The music is interesting, lots of horns and jazzy, just a few sound the same .  LOVE Justin Timberlake though, so it was worth the price
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|when I'm around friends I get asked all the time wow!what game is that. so you know I have to brag that I love it
B000ATQYT2|5.0|So I've always been a Muppet fan but didn't have a copy of this so I bought one last year since my roommate was crazy about it but didn't have a copy apart from her family's.  She knows the thing by heart up and down and said that this is not the original version and that a song was cut from it but we decided that was probably a good move since it was kind of a slow and cheesy song.  Definitely a great movie and we'll watch it over and over!
B00CATSONE|3.0|An interesting, quick, non-fiction read - particularly for the non-specialist.  Having admired Marconi's achievements in the Chelmsford museum just this year, I want to go and tell the curators that they have been unfair to Tesla.
B00BEU19ZU|4.0|A lot of information available on flights to and from the airport, layout and facilities at the airport.  Really good to have some idea of where the shops and banking facilities are before you arrive. Some useful hints pop up like &#34;beware of scams&#34; and details of such things as carry on baggage limitations. At times the screen is congested but the expansion facility does allow better reading with scrolling. A great companion tot Trip It for the traveler..

B00AFCEIB0|3.0|Works but I am not sure you need an app for this function with an adequate search facility in Silk.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|every one should play this game its really fun and its just plain out awesome.great for all ages have fun
B009RH9J7W|5.0|This case is great! I like that I can use the standing case for horizontal or vertical. I also like the hand strap. The material is leather and stylish looking. It's perfect!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very entertaining. Wish there were more levels. I enjoyed the challenges presented. Would recommend this app to my kindle friends.
B000069HZP|5.0|.... This would be more believable if in real life Michael Douglas was in fact turning or about to turn 48 when he made this movie. He , in actuality was 53 when he made this movie as he was born Michael Kirk Douglas on September 25th, 1944. Most movies are made a year before their theatrical release. So , let's say he was 52 to be fair. A 4 long years cry from 48 years old. I guess he could play the role of a 48 year old at 52 or 53 I guess. But , play a role closer to your age , which I guess whoever is reading this might think Michael is closer to that age & a majority , if not everyone will think that age is nothing , but a number. Those who think that must be really geriatrically old to say & think that. Great movie though , but why not have the movie set on Michael's character turning 52 or 53. That would be more believable & more realistic. Not 48. Not when fans who are true fans of him know his real age in real life.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|the game is very challenging. I tend to get frustrated not having enough time to find objects. I don't like that you are asked for money.
B002IJQ3E8|4.0|love that album but if it was new why was the seal broken when I got it? but otherwise is a great album!
B0036WSW8G|5.0|As good as the first one. Fun for the whole family. Loved the movie very funny. Would love to see another one.
B00ECUARO8|3.0|A modern coming of age movie like Stand By Me or The Outsiders.  Matthew McConaughey played a great character role in this story of trust, becoming an adult and dealing with adult problems at those difficult teen years.<br />I recommend it highly!
B003WE9TU8|4.0|I'm not a fan of zombie books or movies, but I really liked this one. It is a serious story, that puts you in many &#34;What would you do...?&#34; situations. Some more science behind the fiction would have been welcome, but I guess that was not the point.
B00EI6E17A|5.0|Love this song and I fell in love even more after I saw the music video, she is so artistic and different I love it! And she is such a positive influence on the world!
0689835604|5.0|My son loves to lift the flaps which keep him interested in the book. Great book would recommend for toddlers.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|In my opinion this was one of my least favorite seasons but after season 6 cliff hanger it's a most see
B000FCK8ZK|5.0|This is my first Dexter book but it won't be my last! It only took one to make me a big fan.
B0081YBD8A|4.0|The variety of characters and what they deal with makes for an interesting series.  The setting of Glasgow is great, and most of the straight girls do a convincing performance as lesbians.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This series came recommended by a friend and it did not disappoint.  After I finished reading it, I still felt a connection with the characters, which I think is a sign of a good book.  I'm glad to see that the Shift Omnibus (Books 6-8) is already available to be downloaded.
B00EABIZ2K|3.0|Its a fairly good album. With Vincent Cavanagh doing an amazing job with X-Ray. The other two featured artists were iffy for me. Overall the album just seemed to be lacking a lot compared to 1&2. This lacking sensation is due to the absence of Steven Wilson (he's only really in Jupiter).
B007FG9LIE|5.0|Let's just say the previous few Kindle books I'd read before this one were &#34;lacklustre&#34; and I needed a shot in the arm to reinforce why I was reading these 'self published books'. &#34;PINES&#34; certainly did that.<br /><br />Once I started reading it I got frustrated with the story because I couldn't figure it out, I got frustrated with the character because HE couldn't figure it out, then I couldn't put it down because it kept drawing me in and wouldn't let me go. This is a great story because it keeps you guessing and even when you figure it out you want to know more. Don't be fooled, this story certainly isn't what it seems when you first start reading it.<br /><br />Imagine waking up by a river, remembering you'd been in a car accident, remembering you were an FBI agent searching for a couple of people. Your wallet, your money, your gun, all your identification is gone, nobody knows who you are, the town sheriff doesn't believe you because you can't prove anything. You've got no where to stay and know no one. How come the road out of town goes no where, how come you can't reach anyone on the phone? How come there's a high electrified fence deep in the woods stopping you hiking out of town?<br /><br />All I'll say is, I've ordered the sequel &#34;Wayward&#34; and it's not being released until the middle of September (2013) and I'm hanging out for it!
0802473156|5.0|Everyone needs this book to help them understand not only themselves but everyone around them.<br />With this book your relationships with everyone will grow.
B008JFUQ16|5.0|HILARIOUS!!!!<br /><br />CLEVER!!!!<br /><br />MUST SEE!!<br /><br />I am one of those people who find it hard to laugh...but this movie is funny...and I laughed.<br /><br />It is better than the first one.<br /><br />I could watch this movie every day if I had to.<br /><br />It is absolutely darling.<br /><br />BUY IT-you won't regret it!
B00BNWWVFG|5.0|This movie caught my by suprise. It is one of the best movies at twists and turns I have seen since in a long time. Rooney Mara stands out as does Jude Law and Cathrine Zeta Jones.<br /><br />This is a must see at least once you might just want to watch it again knowing the ending, I did.
B000OJFV4C|5.0|Great plots! Very good story telling and awesome costumes.  Some episodes are a bit choppy because of so many scenes stitched together.
B0060FXDCG|5.0|The price is great for this movie bundle! Much cheaper then buying all three movies separately. This is an excellent purchase for anyone that wants all the movies at a low price.
B00B4VI8MQ|2.0|I was hoping more for a point and click game but this was primarily hidden object. My frustration comes in with the miss naming of objects I needed to find; for example, I spent some time looking for the bullhorn on the list when it actually wanted a shoehorn. Or looking for a monkey wrench when I needed a crescent wrench, etc.
B009MYARIK|5.0|Sophie Kinsella never disappoints. Super cute read and at times laugh out loud. I am looking forward to the next book :)
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I recently purchased this application and really enjoy its utility. The app offers me many more features than the free application.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Love, love, love this series. I am anxiously awaiting Season 4. Characters are great and story lines are always interesting.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this app i recamend it for all ages ; ) by this app do it its awesome you will get addicted just like I did.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|This show holds my attention, I love the characters, its serious, its funny, its sexy and romantic. Nathan Fillion is a wonderful actor and Stana Katic is his perfect lady detective and lover.
B00D6BN9NK|2.0|Anti radiation gas?  really? and Bruce... you're older, man... just embrace it and stop with the helicoptery jumpy, six story fall, hero bullsh**.

B00DGMVJAO|5.0|FANTASTIC!  This is a fairy tale lovers film: grade A villains, wonderful kings, rebellious princesses, peasant hero, and of course, giants, giants, giants.  I love that they integrate the fee fie fo fum theme into the 'Giant Culture'.
B009G41CG2|5.0|I play mahjong for many years and am happy to be able to play it now when I am travelling !
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|I expect a lot out of my Shakespeare send ups and I got some here but not enough.  I do think the ideas re: zombies are pretty neat and I like the idea of the unredeemable vs the hopeful.  Worth watching.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|Nice little fast paced game. Thought it was gonna be another dud,but turns out I can't put it Down ,hope they keep up Dating it
B000YI7MRM|5.0|film portrayals of the 17th century since the Salkind Three and Four Musketeers movies.  Any swashbuckling aficionados should have this sitting right next to their copy of Cyrano.  Vigo is INCREDIBLE.  Why isn't it on Blu Ray!!??
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|One of the best books I've read in a very long time. Happy, sad, and hopeful. May we all get to love and be loved like Augustus and Hazel.
B00DBSZJRM|3.0|That you can't control.  I get that it's sort of a nouveau medieval take on the Bruce Campbell genre but it just lacks the same cheekiness.
B00B52F278|5.0|This series was spectacular.  It goes to show what can be done in television/movies.<br />I compare all shows now to this series and none come close to the level of caliber and expertise that was put into this.  Gratitude to STARZ for making this most excellent series available for all!
B00COGZ8FU|3.0|As opposed to Tom Cruise drives race cars, Tom Cruise serves drinks, Tom Cruise flies fighter jets... etc.  etc.  Same character... and if you like that character, maybe this film is for you.  But it isn't a coincidence that the Academy hasn't given Tom a nod yet.  Even The Color of Money and Jerry MacGuire- the top of what Tom has to offer- didn't pull an earth shaker out of him... so adding a few guns and some whoopass sure ain't gonna do it.
1439156816|5.0|Its actually the first Steven King book I have read. I will be reading more of his books. This book was helpful in lots of ways. Its a simple straight forward insight into writing.
B005XQLBU4|3.0|This is a good time killer. It's basically like the Missile Defense game from the 80's but updated. Enjoy it.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|It's unfortunate that the publishers decided to put such an awful cover on the American edition of this, because it really shouldn't be relegated to just 'chick lit' as so many people have already commented. That said, I get why it could be classified as such since it revolves around three different women whose lives all come loosely together, each dealing with their own domestic issues. Cecelia, is burdened by a letter she finds in the attic, her husband has written which is to be opened only in the event of his death. Tess is reeling from an admission from her husband and cousin, and Rachel still trying to cope with the  unsolved murder of her daughter. It's an easy read, but one that shouldn't be perceived as light. Moriarty manages, like Jodi Picoult, to infuse enough witty insight into the human condition to give the book both gravitas and depth.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|my kids and I love this game we just cant seem to put the game down. And my kid get all the answers right.  I was surprised at how much they know.
B0063M22QO|5.0|It's nice to have a Mah Jong game with tiles you can see.  Usually they're too small. This game is exactly what I wanted.
B0051XQI84|5.0|very well done. we enjoyed it and it was all appropriate for children. no hidden inuendo. it had good animation
B007THA4FI|5.0|This caught me by surprise, getting more intense as it went along. I'm going to recommend it to some social worker friends.
B009KYXEY6|5.0|The minute I got the cd I could not put it down. After about 20 million replays I put it on my iPhone and I can have it anywhere. I love LDR and this record is the best no doubt!
B005IEGUDY|5.0|A very long read with a unique look at a small part of England from prehistoric times to the end of WWII.  It's a collection of stories about several families at historical points in time.  The place is the link that connects these points.  The growth of this place includes the building and decay of Stonehenge, the town of Bath, and Salisbury Cathedral.  If you enjoy history and a good story, it's worth the time.
B00BLGXL3U|1.0|I usually like independent movies, and this one got pretty positive reviews from critics.  The origins of Scientology, the inspiration for this movie, are also fascinating.  However, after 45 minutes I was just too bored to stick with it -- it was all just a drawn out story of a shabby characters alcoholism.  The film had great potential but blew it.
B00821OX98|4.0|Season 1 was enjoyable.  Good cast of characters, although too heavily loaded with kids and teens.  The lead character was kind of weak in the first episode, but he grows on you afterwards.  Mood Bloodgood does a great job playing the role of the group's doctor.  While well done and entertaining, I feel that the group of character's behavior and appearances, given that they are a rag-tag band of survivals in an apocalyptic world, should be more gritty, more beat-up, and more desperate.  There are glimpses of this, but not enough.  Some folks are walking around in newly laundered clothes.  The special effects are TV quality.  But then it is a TV program, so all is forgiven.  I can't wait to watch Season 2 and 3 which are available now.
B000002GVO|5.0|So glad that I purchased this digital album for my Kindle.<br />It can travel with me also as a CD.<br />I really really like the variety on this album<br />and it has fantastic sound recording!<br />Of course, Don Felder adds SO MUCH to the Eagles!
B0089EHWQE|5.0|From the start author Jojo Moyes pulls us into two very different characters who through circumstance come together. The story forces us to question the fine line between quality of life and the importance of choice. An amazing read.
B00005MAM2|5.0|Watched it the first time and loved it right away. Didn't know it was Akira at the time and now that I've seen it several times I can't help but want to write a review to praise it. It's a very well done film and I think it should be in every Anime fan's collection.
B0073ODRKG|5.0|Madonna's music brings me so many memories from the 80's, 90's and the 00's. I think everyone can releat to her music. It has always been there. It is Madonna baby.<br /><br />The only thing I dont like it is the cheap package of the box. She deserve better but the price is good.
B009A9ETFE|4.0|I loved this CD and so did my boyfriend. However the only disappointing thing is the radio edit bits. Why put radio edit songs into an album? That's just annoying.
B005PW3OS8|5.0|All aspects of the movie, I liked very much; but not the end of it! I was introduced to this subject from very early in my life, and Sargent Fury did not look like the same person, that I knew from the beginning. Many years of reading comic books! Thanks for Animation!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This is a great game both on the original Kindle Fire and on a Samsung Galaxy S2. Only complaint is regarding two devices playing same game... confusion has cost me purchased items to be erased. CAUTION REQUIRED if you play on two devices.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Love it and I play it everyday. Love it on Xbox. I get really excited when the new updates come.I heard the next update is skins and music.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is best app ever I have  a huge kingdom survival and creative are fun modes I advise you get this app!
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I love the ease of setting the alarm and the ease of changing the brightness. The choices of music I am very happy with.
0545586178|5.0|I am reading these books as my son finishes them and I cannot wait to read the next one.  This story is a tale of children sent to represent their districts.  They are to fight until there is only one person left alive.  They do all this to entertain and appease The Capital.  It has great twists and turns.  How many books can you and your 9 year old boy really share?  I definitely recommend it for people 7 to infinity!
B00BI745AA|5.0|So, I finally decide to watch this film remake my ex keeps telling me about. A little back story: In High school I practically had this play memorized. I know the voice of Colm Wilkinson as well as i know my own. I know what this story is supposed to be like. So I've been hesitant to see this play butchered. Anyway, I had looked down to take a bite of my sandwich, when I hear the Bishop start to sing. My jaw dropped, as did my sandwich. I had not looked at the entire cast list (And IMDB has him WAY down on the cast list. That's RUDE guys!). They brought the Original Jean Valjean back for the film! I immediately had a new respect for the potential this film might hold. I proceeded to put down my plate and pay attention.<br /><br />  Really quick, the cast. Anne Hathaway owned her role as Fantine. Nicely done. Hugh Jackman, I knew you could sing but Dude!, Did they actually key that UP for you? Wow. Aaron Tveit, I enjoyed Enjolras and you sang his soul well. Amanda Seyfried, fair performance that got better as the film progressed with a good finish. Eddie Redmayne, huge departure from \\"Powder Blue\\". I'm impressed with your versatility, and nice voice too. Samantha Barks, a fresh and welcome new face and voice. I enjoyed your Eponine. Glad to see your film career taking off. Sacha Baron Cohen & Helena Bonham Carter, you both kept things lively when you were on screen. Daniel Huttlestone, you got spunk kid, I like it. Keep up the good work. And, finally, Russell Crowe. I knew you dabbled in music. Nice to see you get to share it on the big screen and well portrayed sir. As for the rest of the cast, you all helped me reminisce with the environment you recreated.<br /><br />  See, I'm a regular everyday (yes, straight) guy. I just happen to have fallen in love with a few plays over the years. Phantom, Fiddler on the Roof, Miss Saigon, Rent, Les Mis' and others. I'm a singer and I love good stories set to music. I've listened to this music hundreds of times. Unexpectedly,I got choked up. That happened more than once, and not many films can impact me that sharply. I BELIEVED it. This story truly has sadness and loss, but if rendered without passion, it has no depth. This had passion. This had depth. I guess what I'm saying is, I truly liked it. Rented it, but purchasing it soon.
B00368PSN2|5.0|This movie is a much overlooked scifi sword and sorcery classic. The bluray was great and the price made it a no brainer.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|I felt like the book was written for children. The simple way it was written, the Disney's Aladdin feel in the last few chapters, the spiritual nonsense, the messages were nearly spelt out for you and so on, but still for the reasons I will jot down below, I felt I had to award it full stars.<br /><br />It spoke to me and at times it felt very direct, as if particular chapters were written specifically for me. And that might be the reason why so many people like this book.<br /><br />Some of the things I got out of this book were:<br />1. The only way to have a fulfilling and rewarding life is to get out of your comfort bubble.<br />2. Also to persist and not give up against the obstacles that you will face once you leave it.<br />3. That everybody has a reward\goal\'personal legend' he\she deserves in life<br />4. Also that you must find out what it is and then seek it<br />5. Its not the reward\goal\'personal legend' you strive for which makes your life worth living, but the journey towards it and the amazing people you meet on the way.<br />6.  But if you're content with spending the rest of your life talking to sheep and doing the same old thing, then stay where you are.<br /><br />These are great messages that many can relate to. Its the book I wish I read when I was younger, although I might not have had the patience to read it then.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|great game and images.......seems really fun so far honestly just started it but so far so good<br />would definetly reccomned it

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|best rush run game ever. everyone must play. minions are the best thing ever created. why haven't you downloaded it yet?
0316201545|5.0|The Enchantress Returns is the second book in this magical series. The twins must return to the Land of Stories in order to save their mother, their grandmother, and the whole land. How will they find a way back in, will they be able to save everyone, and will there be a Happily Ever After?<br /><br />I have to agree with other reviewers, the writing in this installment was more refined. It flowed better. The story itself was slightly less captivating to me, but it was still strong, interesting, and fast-paced. For such a very long book, I always enjoyed going back to it to read some more adventures. I have to say, parts of it felt like a different telling of the Harry Potter series. There was of course the good vs. evil, but there was also a special wand involved, and the magical dream at the end. Without giving too much away, I'm just going to say the dream reminded me of the \\"dream\\" at the end of Harry Potter when they thought he was killed.<br /><br />This is a great addition to the series for middle grades. The book is REALLY long, so it might be hard for younger kids to work their way through. There was also some mild language at the beginning that some parents might not appreciate. For an adult, the story is very predictable. It is appropriate for the age intended though, and there are even some unexpected things for adults to enjoy. Overall, probably a 4-star read for me, but definitely deserves the 5 stars for a fun children's book.
B0040I09RM|5.0|Great story line,  Action, emotion, humor, the ups and downs of everyday life...this series has it all!  This family is hooked on SOA.
B00B7FOQCK|5.0|Hi,<br /><br />I had never heard of Anker before(living in Australia) so I didnt know if it was the right brand to buy, but I went with as I was tired and frustrated working with USB 2.0 hub's.<br /><br />I plugged it and BOOOM, you knew the difference immediately. It just worked and the speeds were amazing. Though its not as good as transferring files directly from one drive to another, still does the job pretty well.<br /><br />One thing I like about USB 3.0 is the ability to connect to devices without needing any external power for it, which was just amazing considering I had to power my devices with USB 2.0.<br /><br />Now I think Anker has changed the product design as the image displayed on here looks like a rectangle hub where as I bought the one that was square with 4 ports on all sides.<br /><br />Anker design and built quality is excellent, and I love the products as I have now bought  a few Anker products.<br /><br />If you are looking for a USB 3.0 hub without the need for power then this would be your choice.
B0058OUJA4|4.0|The account permissions folks complained about in 2011 no longer appear when downloaded now.  No issue there (using Nexus 7).  Cannot nit pick too much with it having a FREE price.
B00A0ABQLM|5.0|Hi,<br /><br />I bought this USB 3.0 ethernet adapter to connect to my Surface Pro to stream and download.<br /><br />I had never heard of Anker before, and was quiet hesitant to buy it as it didn't seem genuine. However, since buying Anker products( USB 3.0 Hub too) I have complete confidence in their products.<br /><br />Anker products are designed well and look beautiful and have a built that makes you feel like a quality (something about the name made me question it, my apologies) product. I would never hesitate to buy an Anker product, as I love them now.<br /><br />There are 3 indicator lights which are coloured and it looks beautiful and the speeds are amazing.<br /><br />If you are looking for buying a USB ethernet adapter, just go ahead and buy it with confidence.
B000NGTJTY|5.0|i saw it again after almost 5 years. co-worker wouldn't stop quoting dialogues from the movie. So had to see it again to refresh myself. I remembered bits and pieces. But the real punch is in dialogues and expressions.<br />Excellent movie. Very well made. Needless to say actors make or break a good story.<br />Even with a loaded star cast The Departed doesn't lose it's way. Each character has played its part to perfection.<br />For me best was di caprio. He is on edge throughout. Very vulnerable, very dangerous, very desperate for his safety.<br />Absolute must watch and rewatch until you can quote the dialogues. :)
B00A9ET4MC|5.0|I liked the book as she articulated feelings and experiences I had coming to and living in America though I was not from Africa but India. I love the way she described everything. The only thing I could not relate to was her hair issue but it gave me a better understanding of how it is for people who have different issues about hair than I do.<br /><br />Lena

B0063M22QO|4.0|NEVER PLAYED THIS GAME BEFORE BUT REALLY LIKE GRAPHICS. Great way to pass time and a challenge in the timed game.
B00AEBB9T6|5.0|I like the &#34;Buck Rogers&#34; style of sci-fi, a bit cheesy but with a lot of action. Add in the simple plot an undermanned staff of artists and Angelina Jolie with an eye-patch and you have a winner in my book!
B00CL151G4|4.0|Visually, this DVD set is fine but the sound quality is not up to par.  We have had to replay many scenes to understand the dialogue.  That said, we love this show and are immensely enjoying this version of Sherlock and Watson!

B00CHIMG6Y|4.0|Naomi Watts was incredible.  The fact that it was based on a real story made it intriguing.  A window into how people deal with the impossible,
B003B02PEU|5.0|If you are from a small town, especially from the South, you will enjoy this book.  The plot is great, but what I enjoy most is the vivid description of the people, the layout of the town, and the general &#34;way-of-life&#34; of the small town.  We have lost the town square.  We have lost the need to entertain each other.  We have lost the need for neighbors.  This book and most of his other books bring back this lost time.
193413712X|4.0|It is a short, small reading.  The description is quite good in terms of an individual life during a time period of &#34;hard times.&#34;  I found it mostly sad.

B001QK91TY|5.0|This is a beautifully photographed and recorded movie of some of the greatest jazz stars ever.  Anita O'Day and Mahalia Jackson, among many others, give spectacular performances.
0802407692|5.0|Loved the book ! I read it in about 3 days. Gary's insight about the 5 love languages made so much sense and the little things he added about deployments actually helped a lot. Especially since we are in our second deployment. I would definitely recommend this book to other military couples  !
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I play this game everyday. I like it because it's more than just bingo and earning the rewards. Definitely recommend!

B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I love it it is awesome cool fun buuuttt I need promo codes hey backflip studios please make more codes thanks bye
B0050DIWFC|2.0|Slow going and tedious at first. Picked up speed, but had some weird moments, some unbelievable ones. Overall, the book was a disappointment. Some good courtroom scenes, but unlikable characters, some far-fetched story lines. Unsettling ending(s)
B000WN7NEQ|5.0|Great movie -brought va k memories of my ballroom dancing days -I did competition and showcase -so much fun to do
B0050DIWFC|5.0|The story pulls in the reader from the start.  The nature or nurture question about human nature stands behind all the twists and turns of the plot.  It was a really good read.
B007TUAHVQ|4.0|It's a great and exciting set!  I bought it for my nephew for his birthday!  He loved it, and started putting it together right when the party ended.  It was great fun until we found out it was missing a piece!  It was kind of a bummer, but we called the number and they shipped us the missing piece right away!  They were really good about it!  That is great service in my mind.

B009NY43NY|3.0|It was a good ending to the book, but definitely not the one I wanted. Good read, but I'm really sad it's over!!
B007RRFUHM|4.0|I loved this CD so much, I bought another one.  My wife and I are in different countries, she's Filipino.  We listened to this CD over and over when we were together.  I bought another one when I got back to the US just so we could be together again in spirit.  This is a great CD.
B003KK6GOQ|2.0|Found the writing by Julia, the main letter writer very flowery. However, the book did open my eyes to what the people of Guernsey went through during the war and I found this very interesting.
B002N1AEN2|4.0|Great CD.  I had downloaded several songs on ITunes and I finally decided to buy the CD.  It sounds great in my car and makes for a nice commute.  You'll like it too.
B0090P98Z4|3.0|liked it. it was really cool it was kinda like diablo could have maid moving easier.but other than that the game was good
B0061JPYX2|4.0|I had to listen to this CD over and over when I stopped drinking.  It definitely inspires you, especially when you connect with someone like Amy Winehouse on that level.  Good luck in your journeys.  This CD will not let you down.
B0013TXA5Y|3.0|I hoped this book would better than it was since they are making it into a motion picture. I hope the movie is good.
0307957837|5.0|It's going to be durable and last a long time. It's such a nice looking book, with a bonus ribbon for a book mark in it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Be serious people!  This was not written to be a literary great,  just an enjoyable summer read.<br /><br />It's not really about sex and S & M,  it's about a young woman that is in awe of a uber-wealthy guy & whether she can, or even wants to, change herself to be what he wants.  And she tries to change him, which is impossible with any man.  It was more of a coming of age story with lots of sex thrown in.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|My husband and I love the writing on this story, excellent drama that will always keeps you on your toes!
B000QCS8TW|2.0|For all the hype, a dull rambling book the plot of which is not at all obvious although one guesses that the disparate elements will be brought together in Book 4 if you care to plod through that far. I personally gave up half way through Book 2, having better things to do with my time. If it is a fantasy, epic adventure that you want, re-read Lord of the Rings. Don't waste time on this pot boiler
B002JXK5VU|5.0|Like this type of series, enjoy watching every episode, the characters are very likable, story plot is captivating, great show
0385528787|5.0|The final, haunting volume in Atwood's brilliantly imaginative trilogy that started with Oryx and Crake and continued with Year of the Flood. If you have not read the others, I suggest that you do, altho the author does sum up details of the earlier books. Atwood's scientific background makes her vision of the post-collapse future eerily plausible. Highly recommended.
1426308469|4.0|Greatest dino book I ever had. Historical info is cool. Why 4 stars, you ask? I couldn't find \\"pterodactyl\\" in it. But still, this is an awesome book.<br /><br />In the future, I might attend to purchase other National Geographic books like this. I don't know, but maybe.<br /><br />For those of you who like dinosaur history, I highly recommend you buy it.
B0025X4OYI|5.0|I've enjoyed his work for many years since I first saw him in the early 60's.  This has been my favorite.
B00AZMFK3K|2.0|There were certainly positive aspects to this film. The effects were well-conceived, the pacing was brisk and it didn't have a sagging middle act like the first nu-Trek movie did.  Cumberbatch was charismatic if a little two-dimensional. Each of the main characters got their \\"moment\\".<br /><br />But the fundamental problem with Into Darkness is the same problem most of the Star Trek films have had since Wrath of Khan - the attempt to shoehorn a science fiction adventure franchise into a standard heroes-and-villians action movie. I'm not saying Khan wasn't a great movie, but it should not have become the template for all the Trek films to follow. That's why Star Trek always worked better as a tv series, because it gave the writers the freedom to explore unusual and challenging ideas and to focus on characters instead of spectacle. The people who made this movie, slick and glossy as it is, have no interest in the kind of Trek Gene Roddenberry originally envisioned. There is no depth, no new or interesting ideas just a lot of hollow superficial nods to what people love about Star Trek.<br /><br />I guess what is especially insulting is that they can't even be bothered to create a new kind of villain. They just keep returning to the same tired tropes. Khan (Wrath of Khan), Soran (Generations), Ru'afo (Insurrection), Shinzon (Nemesis), Nero (Star Trek '09) and Khan (Into Darkness) are all damaged men concealing their identities who have been wronged in some way by the Federation or Kirk and are seeking revenge. It's a story that's been told so often in the Star Trek universe now that it's hard to remember films like The Motion Picture or The Voyage Home that HAD NO VILLAIN. Those films, while flawed in their own ways, at least made an attempt to dip into the rich history of science fiction storytelling and create something more than fistfights and laser battles. Into Darkness is such an un-science fiction film that you could easily take out the tech and change the costumes and make this into a Lethal Weapon movie.<br /><br />The one bright light of the film is the ending, which suggested they might take subsequent films in a new direction, hopefully one that doesn't involve an evil maniacal super-villain.
B007704HO6|5.0|This book is a really good read and one of those books I can't put down. Good story, and although I'm more of a dog lover, I have fallen in love with Bob!
0399226907|5.0|It was great, my daughter enjoyed reading it.<br />The selection of the creature is highly symbolic of our lives. With patience, a crawling creature could one day fly!
B009NY43NY|1.0|Garbage. I'm not wasting time on writing spoilers. I feel cheated and would like the author to write me a personal check for the amount I spent on the books and time lost. This pile of $!@ was so inconsistent when it came to the characters that I refuse to read anything Harris will ever write. Scammer!
1451695195|4.0|The author is convincing that he really did have a near death experience.  There were a few things different in this book compared to other books on this subject, but I know that he experienced the things he said he did.  Wonderful book!
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is the second time that I have read the series.  I found the story line to be  educational \\"Rich vs poor\\" I'm sure DDay prospers will find this a good read.
B005LAII4E|4.0|I was very upset to find out channing tatum not in this one, so going into this I was hesitant.  however once it got going I was really please who they brought in since channing was not in it, like dwayne johnson (the rock), or bruce willis, even though a small part, and the cast had a great connection....and the story line was more entertaining in this one vs. The first
B00CLD671A|5.0|This series is exceptional.  The acting, dialogue and character development is great.  Each episode and season will leave you wanting more.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Awesome game!!! It's so worth it! The updates are making it closer and closer to Xbox edition and PC! Luv it, it's so much fun! GR8 game!! :)
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|i've played everyone and this by far is the best from every detail down to the team fortress 2 Easter egg
B00CATSONE|3.0|A short bio on and interesting scientist.  Probably ahead of his time and a little too trusting of his fellow man.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|I got into this show way later than others, and i got hooked after I saw the first episode. It doesn't get boring like some shows, It keeps you wondering what is going to happen now, and I was just disappointed that they killed off my favorite character. That was just the only disappointing thing about this season.
B00BMULNHG|5.0|Moonshine is not only the first but also the best detective novels written so far.I have read Sherlock Holmes and agatha christies, but this is way above the others. I recommend this book highly.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|Has a good but foreseeable plot, but overall is a decent movie.  I wouldn't have wanted to pay the money to see it in theaters though.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book kept me on the damage if my seat when I was going to read my summer reading I read this and it was the best
B008P1EWIM|5.0|I got this because it looked simple and eye pleasing, which it is. I like checking it and knowing what my day and week turn into
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love the game it is so funny and crazy I hope the have minion rush run 2  all the games I get from here are  awesome
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Well written book.  I finally bought this book after seeing the 4+ stars and almost 6 thousand (!!!) reviews.  Not quite what I expected in terms of subject matter (heavy stuff) but it was a welcomed deviation from the other NA stories.<br />I'd definitely check out this author's other books in the future.  I just need to first finish reading the 50+ books on my wish list!
B0062NAX1U|5.0|This movie is really well-done.  It helps to give us pause to think about the really important things in life.  We all get so busy with our daily lives.  This firefighter father had a real awakening and this movie shows what a life-changer it was.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I loved this game! If you're a horse fan you will love this game. I know I love this game
1609611543|5.0|This book is very informative.  Clear and concise.  I recommend this book for anyone who is looking to improve their health through diet.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|The upgrade took me by surprise. My initial reaction was &quot;why&quot; ?  I got over the change shock pretty quickly and am back to using this app everyday.

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This games is AWESOME!!!! From, the time I've been playing this game......I never wanted to stop playing it. I LOVE THIS GAME!!
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|I have read the Pendergast series in order, and absolutely love the series. This book seemed to drag on too much with  quite a few side stories, that really didn't add anything to the plot of the book. We started with a newspaper reporter finding out things, leading to Corrie's discoveries, that sent her on a tangent into a whole different crime to solve (very boring stuff) and a whole other side story of Constance's psychiatrist (that gets him nowhere) All this in addition to Pendergast's personal plight to retrieve his wife, leading to a big surprize, which also happens to be the true plot of the book.<br />At any rate, the story of Pendergast did progress a bit and I did enjoy the book, just somewhat drug out.
B0010AN7Y0|4.0|Overall, a funny yet touching comedy.  It was one of the movies I remember really liking in the 80's.  Altho the plot has held-up over the years, it is definitely 80's all-the-way when seen in this day and age.
B0096CDG0O|5.0|I love playing Dice with Buddies! The new tournament mode is awesome! Thanks for making such a fun game :)
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|It is lots of fun for the grandkids of all ages from 6 & up.  It keeps you busy & fast moving.  Lots of levels to get past.
1416595236|3.0|I am a HUGE fan of the late Vince Flynn. However, the ending of this<br />book was weird for me. It wasn't at all believable that Mitch would<br />allow a mortal enemy to live when given the opportunity to make him pay.<br />Sorry, but the enemy's daughter being named after Mitch's wife was<br />totally corny. (the baby being named in memory of Anna was first<br />mentioned in \\"Consent to Kill\\")Aside from the unlikely ending,<br />the overall pacing of the story was slow and<br />not up to the caliber of Flynn's previous books.<br />Still, I am forever a fan of Flynn's books.
B008J05EL8|1.0|It won't open and won't work and I have no clue how to get my money back... All the other posts are right!! Don't buy this!
B008XBCJ34|5.0|If you want a good starter 3d blu ray, this is your ticket! Great quality! We love that it includes dvd and bluray disks.
B0078X2LKY|5.0|A great book for little ones even 30 years after it was first read to me.  I hope she enjoys it as much as I do.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Wow!  I really got into this book.  It may have been because I was on vacation but I think it was because the author really brought the characters to life and I really wanted to know what was going to happen.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|Although I believe the latest version of the Star Trek saga is outstanding, I often find myself noticing the discrepancies between the movies and the original Star Trek series.  The most glaring is the death of Christopher Pike in &#34;Into Darkness.&#34;  Any true Star Trek fan knows that &#34;Captain Pike&#34; was confined to a futuristic wheelchair and eventually stayed behind on a planet where he was restored to his healthy self by aliens.  How does Abrams reconcile this obvious mistake?  Insofar as Khan is concerned, there is no evidence whatsoever in the original series episode involving Khan that he was in Star Fleet.  And if Kirk, et al met Khan during &#34;Into Darkness,&#34; then why wasn't he known to Kirk and the crew in the Star Trek original episode?<br /><br />Despite these mistakes, I found &#34;Into Darkness&#34; to be well made, action packed, and I'm ready for the next movie already.
B00005ATZT|5.0|It doesn't take much guesswork to determine my favorite part of this great film...the speech made by Tommy Lee Jones's Deputy U.S. Marshal Samuel Gerard to start up the manhunt for Harrison Ford's Dr. Richard Kimble.  And that is only the start of what there is to like about this film.  It's not hard to root for both main characters and being left to wonder how they might both come out on top in the end is certainly worth those two hours of watching.  These brillant men are surrounded by excellent supporting characters and face off against brillant villains whose identities are perfectly obscured until just the right time...and even then the ending is still uncertain.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I liked this book because it was written as though I was in a conversation with Chris Kyle. Plain language! Great descriptors and good story!
B0002J4ZWS|5.0|Sure, this movie is on TV all the time.  That doesn't diminish it's wonderful plot and brilliant acting.  This movie did not get the recognition it deserved when it first came out in theaters.  So I now encourage everyone to give it the proper recognition and add this DVD to their collection for enjoyment on a schedule not dictated by any television schedule.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I enjoyed this book, it was a quick read. The story kept you going. The author keeps you interested all the way through until the end.
B0000AYJXR|5.0|...need I say more?  When Michael Jordan is recruited by the Looney Tunes for their basketball game against a group of monsterus aliens, you know you're in for a good time.  This movie certainly does not dissappoint.  True, this movie is a bit older today, but if you want to teach your kids about Michael Jordan or the Looney Tunes, then you can kill two birds with one stone and enjoy it all over again right next to them.  So...GAME ON!
B0001HLVS2|5.0|It is hard to believe this film has been around for a decade, and indeed it gets better every time I watch it.<br /><br />For me, it is not only that Patrick O'Brien is a great author, the director of the film, Peter Weir, has done a masterful job of presentation and the actors used in this film are all excellent, and especially Russell Crowe.<br /><br />Being an amateur historian with a great interest in British history of this period, this film is a treasure.  For those viewers not familiar with the naval terms of that time, some of this will go over their heads, but a little patient research will take the viewer into a world of long ago, when wooden ships sailed the seas, and the British navy was the ruler of the same.<br /><br />The beginning of the film shows the British frigate \\"Surprise\\" sailing at night.  The caption states, \\" HMS Surprise, 28 guns  197 souls N. coast Brazil.\\"  With this simple summary, you realize that these are not just mere sailors, they are souls, bound together on a wooden ship of 28 guns. As in the beginning as throughout the movie, you see a realistic interpretation of what life on an English man-of-war was like at the beginning of the 19th century.<br /><br />Through the character of Captain Jack Aubry, you learn the respect that he has for his crew and their well-being, and at the same time his resolute courage in carrying out the orders given to him.  Dr. Stephen Maturin, the ship's doctor, plays an important role in this movie as a dedicated doctor, but lacking the stubbornness if you will of Aubry and the resulting tensions that arise from this, to be resolved at a later time in the Galapagos Islands (30 years before Charles Darwin's journey there).<br /><br />Every attention is given to detail.  The viewer will understand the movie better if familiar with terms used at that time (hard a larboard... the taffrail, the weather gauge, and many more.<br /><br />The biggest surprise of the movie thus far for me is that the sequel has not shown up because the ending of the story allows for another adventure to take place.  Well, Hollywood will take care of that in due time.<br /><br />Of some importance is the fact that you can watch this movie as a family.  There is very little profanity, and no nudity, but there is violence.  You see men killed and it was most interesting to watch the effect of cannonballs on wood.  One of the leading causes of death was flying splinters during an engagement.  With that said, Aubry makes it clear to one of the midshipmen during combat to stand tall on the quarterdeck.  Officers could not show fear to their men, and indeed, Lord Nelson himself was felled by the bullet of a French sniper during the battle of Trafalgar while standing tall on the quarterdeck of the Victory.<br /><br />I admit I am an Anglophile, a student of naval history as well as British history, so this movie was right up my alley.<br /><br />A great film and very entertaining.not shown up because the ending of the story allows for another adventure to take place.

B000M5AJQS|5.0|There's Jack Nickelson, playing a mob boss who definitely has a few loose screws up in his noggin.  There's Matt Daman, playing a police officer who's on the mob boss's side but nevertheless wants to look out for himself first and foremost.  There's Leonardo DeCaprio, playing an undercover cop determined to bring down his mark and come out of this whole mission alive.  And then there's everyone else...I could sing praises for every actor in this extraordinary film, but I just don't have that kind of time.  Overall, \\"The Departed\\" is a movie that should be placed into a genre of it's own as it goes above and beyond any police procedural and gangster film.  My only negative comment is that they could have tried to utter a few lines without swearing...a little less language and we'd have a perfect score...as it stands now, it's at 4.9.  I'd certainly watch this film over and over again anyway...and so should you.  Enjoy.
B00DYEN5QU|3.0|The Man Of steel what can I say,I have been a Dc fan all my life. \\"NOT A FANBOY\\" to be clear!! I had such high hopes for this film like \\"you would not believe\\". I wanted this movie to compete with the Nolan trilogy of batman, and  Shane blacks Iron man 3,some how I knew the film would not come close to the avengers which is ok with me because it is an origins story.And we all know how that can go!I felt that {Cavills} acting was a bit dry. Don't get me wrong, some of the scenes in the film was \\"AMAZING\\" such-as the part when he was hovering over the military base, I felt all he had to do was clap his hands together and blow every one away and be done.----<br /><br />I wanted there to be some realism to the film. I know people this day and age say well: If everyone or someone!!- \\"Lois lane\\"  knows who super man is or, the hero in the story, it adds more depth to the story. I personally don't think so, That is one thing that bothered me with the Nolan films. I also felt that faora, was more of a bad ass than super-man. The way she was ripping through people and jet fighters like paper. Not to forget the scene when she and  Christopher Maloney was about to go at, NOW!! that was some \\"\\"realism\\"\\" at that point he realized holy shi..this alien  bitc is about to kill me!!, till superman came to his aid. I also  like most,could not get over the sheer destruction of the city. The power plants, buildings, civilians. I thought \\"supes\\" would have said, lets take this fight to a place that has less than a billion people. Or hell lets go to the desert. I am sure half  a million died, most after they knocked over  a few nuclear power plants.<br /><br />I wanted this film to be so great that I!!a long time batman fan would have said well the man of steel\\" was better than the Nolan films. It just wasn't that film. I do hope that pt. 2 is Bette. And Super man vs. Batman soon to come. As far as it goes, I think the worst is over.Now they have added the new origins story to the big screen in a modern state now they can move on with more drastic films were {supes} is a vet and knows when to take a fight somewhere else. cause I am sure Bruce wont be having total destruction in pt. 2<br /><br />+The blue ray bundle is great in terms of high clarification.
B004Q7IAQE|5.0|I ordered this for my girlfriend's birthday but i ordered it only one day before her birthday so it didn't arrive until 5 days after. But that wasn't an issue at all! My girlfriend loves HK so when she saw it, she just fell in love and it's like it wasn't even late! Lol. Whether it's an apology gift or a birthday gift, this is the perfect size, price, and cuteness for anyone!
B00881VLCE|5.0|I grew up having a jigsaw puzzle(s) on the front table constantly. We would add a piece or two when we walked by or while waiting for the school bus to arrive. This brings back those memories. I can add a piece when ever I get a minute or just sit and finish one. Great fun!
B00BKRON5K|4.0|Anyone who has ever been on any diet will know how many people will question what and why they are eating the things they are. This book was an awesome source of information to lay rest to all those questions while I embarked on a 30 day Paleo challenge recently.
B002QY9RMA|5.0|This is a great album. I lost the disc from a few years ago. Most songs are still on the radio. Thanks for great shipping.
140006922X|3.0|I enjoyed this work very much in the beginning.  However, midway through, I felt it became repetitive.  This book is thought provoking.
B007KQI1NA|5.0|Easy installation with the mini-CD provided. All I had to do was change the COM port in my GPS software and it works flawlessly and more accurately than my old Garmin GPS-18.
B002Q1YDLI|5.0|A fun romance to read. Good suspense and drama too! A thoroughly modern romance that makes me want to know what happens next.
B0058OUJA4|3.0|To all the reviewers griping about account permissions, that request is no longer present. As for the game itself, it's a bit lackluster but still a good time waster which is what a tower defense should be. Especially as the FAotD, it's worth it.
B003Z0BWRM|5.0|This my second time reading this book and I've got to say... It still is amazing even though I already knew what was going to happen. But, this book is just so brilliantly written that it still makes you feel the same way you did when reading this the first time. Absolutely wonderful.<br /><br />I also forced my friend to read this book, and at first she really didn't want to. But now, she is so engrossed in the book, she hardly acknowledges my existence when we're together. This just proves how brilliant this book is, it plunges you deep into the world of shadow hunters and makes you wish to live in a world like theirs.<br /><br />Cassandra Clare is a genius!
B0056BMK6K|5.0|I found the information very helpful. The book gives a complete view of how the author markets his books which is what I wanted to know.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I enjoyed this book.  I did not, however, find it totally riveting, but I was able to stick with the author's style.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|Anyone who likes RR Martin or Rothfus will enjoy this well written story. Hopefully Ryan will continue writing more about these characters.
B00EBRWN80|1.0|It just didn't work on my CRUZ. SO frustrating! Why can't they make apps easier to load? I mean I'm just sayin!
B004J4WLB4|4.0|Beautiful in depth analysis of how difficult relationships with others can be when you've had a traumatic upbringing.  Both heartbreaking and hopeful.  A must read for anyone who works with foster children or youth!!
B00DJZ06DO|5.0|Haven't watched it yet, but Amazon is bugging me for a rating so... Anyway, it IS Evangelion and I really enjoyed the first two, this should be no different.
B00555X8OA|5.0|Very thought provoking and nice flow to the read. Really makes you think about a complicated topic in an inuitive and clear way. Clearly a well written intelligent read.
B009P3N1GI|4.0|This is the first Brandon Sanderson book I have read, but now I am interested in reading some others. I struggled through the first chapter and then was hooked and could not put it down.  What do you need to build a personality ? The book raises interesting questions and is set in a world of dominance and subservience, secret societies, different world views, magic and mystery.
B009ZQJ1G4|5.0|I don't know why I had never heard of this movie until it popped up as a suggestion on here (for shame, I know), but for a movie that's 11 years old now, I was completely blown away by the choreography of the gun/fight scenes, by the story itself, and the cast. The \\"Gun-Kata\\" concept, design, and implementation was impressive and beautifully done more with the choreography than with special effects, and I think that's what I truly loved the most about this movie. Though it has a Matrix vibe, it does NOT have the special effects, which is very nice. While I love the Matrix and its SFX, I truly appreciate a good flick that can pull off the story without all the crazy slo-mo and the like.<br /><br />This movie is definitely finding its way into my library. It's one that I will watch over and over.
B004HD61KE|4.0|Few dead spots and the flow was real.  Very well written and you can see yourself within this story.. That is all.. This last words are written just to meet the requirement to have 12 words
B009MCRHH6|2.0|1. On a Wii the game would cost 500 or 1000 points (A.K.A, $5 or $10)<br />2.unless you go 1,2, or 3 levels at a time, the game would feel short, so in a future update, more levels,story, species of goo, and gameplay possibilities is an order because $2.99 is worth more than about 50 levels 80 percent of them being quick<br />3.1 good thing is this game would make people feel like it was made in the current year in which you are reading this review, A 3DS remake should be tended to.
B009AY04A8|5.0|A little hard to use lots of accidental touches but not bad all in all. Kills time .  Stretch mode works better than expected. Colors bright and easy to see.
B008XG1X18|4.0|Easy to use.Lots of interesting categories . Only it does quit quite often when I'm pinning. Otherwise it's fun scrolling all the boards.
0761169253|5.0|Steal Like an Artist was not written for those who take themselves seriously. It's probably not even written for those who plan to make a living with art or creativity. It's written for us commoners who are intimidated by the \\"process\\" and need a kick in the pants to do something - even if it isn't good at all. Is this a good book as literature or art goes? Probably not. But if a \\"good\\" rating depends on my enjoyment of it it gets a 9 out of 10. Will I read it again? I'll probably move on. Will I refer to it again? Very likely. Excuse me now. Some Crayolas are calling me.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Keeps you on the edge of your seat. Fun puzzles excellent graphics. Needs to be more like it. More please!
B00BGD8CFK|4.0|Actual color is exact and it fits properly. I would recommend this to orange lovers. Packaged well. Good durability. Four stars!
1490313370|5.0|I am a 50 year old psychologist and entrepreneur. In the past two years I have read over 50 books on personal change, finding your passion, entrepreneurial startups, and branding/marketing/relationship development and promotion. Most of those books were worth my time, some were great, and a few stood out. James Altucher's Choose Yourself! is near the top of the list of those that stood out.<br /><br />Why? First of all, James has committed himself to being honest and transparent about his journey to where he is today--including his failures and moments of despair. This added to his credibility and drew me in closer as he laid out his road map for finding success and happiness.<br /><br />The best part of Choose Yourself! is James' recommendation that each of us is responsible for developing what he calls a \\"Daily Practice\\" of behaviors that support our physical, emotional, and spiritual well-being. He states that we must figure out who we are and what is truly important to us from the inside out rather than based on all of the messages that bombard us from the outside. The idea that learning to \\"sit in silence\\" is a more fruitful pathway for discovering our passions than watching TV may strike some readers as obvious or steeped in New Age thinking, but to me it rings completely true.<br /><br />I recognize that Choose Yourself! is not for everyone. Some prior reviewers found James' writing voice annoying or found his opinions rambling and with no basis in scientific research. My experience was that James came across as authentic, admittedly flawed, and genuinely interested in helping others learn from his many experiences. If you're looking for the latest cutting edge research on behavior change or finding happiness, look elsewhere. But if you're open to learning from someone else's compelling personal stories, consider reading this book and Choosing Yourself!
B0011EVSGE|5.0|I would rank this the #2 all time favorite family entertainment movie,  only rivaled by &#34;The Sound Of Music&#34;.<br />These films portray a kinder, simpler time in the mid 1960's before drugs, loose moral and social chaos globally.<br /> Our new digital native  generation perhaps can sense a unique feeling of &#34;pure Innocence&#34; and a precious lack of overloaded hyped-up sensationalism these timeless films. Very educational material to show what media the baby-boomer generation was under these positive influences then, in a global sense. The songs, are sheer magic.
B005VPRFSY|4.0|My 5 year old has recently gotten into playing LEGO Star Wars on the Wii so we bought him this set for his birthday.  He was able to look at the picture and instructions and assemble it himself and he was extremely happy.  Recommend this set for this age as it doesn't have TOO many pieces (there are still a lot - it IS a LEGO kit after all) and it is relatively easy to put together quickly so they can get to playing with it.<br /><br />I like that the characters are adorable too.
B002QRWJA4|5.0|Andrew Lloyd Webber's signature masterpiece musical.<br />Greatest Songs EVER!!! DIVINE! N mesmerizing.<br />A MUST-SEE to appreciate a first class legendary Broadway musical being crafted so wonderfully into a fine film.
B0049EN064|1.0|Arrived ahead of time. But, It will not work in any of my players.  Not for this region!  Very disappointing to purchase and then not enjoy!!
B0018QOIXU|2.0|I thought since I absolutely love Adele 21, it would be nice to have her CD from earlier years.  I was disappointed with it and her voice is definitely not as mature.  Since I made the decision to purchase it, I just chose to keep it even though I may never play it again.  I may sell it in a garage sale one day.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|The only reason I didn't give this a 5 star rating is because Reacher didn't kick nearly as much butt as he normally does. There was a lot of space between any fight sequences. I hope his next book follows in typical Reacher fashion with more fight sequences like all his previous books.<br /><br />I hope the movie didn't change his style...
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I have played this game for about five minutes and I am totally in love with it! There is&nbsp;so&nbsp;much activities for you to do.you will never be bored playing this app.
B001XUH69Y|5.0|A fantastic movie set in WWII, major stars, Bergman and Bogart with a huge list of supporting actors. Set aside time and watch this movie!
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|this is one of the best free games that I have played. you just want to get that great white.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|i've loved the show from day 1.  season 6 disappointed me a bit, but season 7 helped get it back on track!
B009VIZDLI|5.0|The funniest book I have read in many years. Highly recommended. Many a dead pan joke on every page. Both main characters are gems.
B0079NQZLE|5.0|it is subtitled, so you'll be reading a lot.  but it's really good.  it does have plot similarities to hunger games, but it is very violent.  they have their own katniss and peeta, even a few careers, including their own personal finnick.  this was before hunger games, so maybe it's actually the other way around.  not kid friendly at all, so your young hg fans who may be interested, may need to wait a few more years before watching.
B003UESJH4|5.0|I'd recommend this to anyone. Compelling story and great history! Britain was at a crossroads, and in need of a leader. The movie deserved its awards. LJ
0307341577|5.0|my mom is reading this book and she loves it so myuch she reads it every day sometimes and yet no tracking information
B00D23GXB2|5.0|A hot love story in the form of free and powerful poetry. This book sung to my heart and I read it faster than I expected, walking around the house devouring it, even as I vacuumed and dusted. It's not often an author does that for me, not often at all. Some of my favourite lines:<br />\\"My dark skin contains odes written to you in various fonts.\\"<br />AND<br />\\"I am now an eclipse.\\"<br /><br />Simple (sometimes, sometimes not), elegant, sexy writing. Next book please!<br /><br />HMC
B006H5120E|5.0|The 3D re-relesed of this movie makes it just much better than it already was. It increases the realism of all scenes.<br />I highly recomend this version of Titanic.
B007TUAHVQ|5.0|I previously owned only 2 Halo Mega Bloks sets: the Banshee and the Rockethog vs Anti-Aircraft Gun sets. This set's warthog blew both of the precious vehicles out of the water.<br /><br />UNSC Figures: The set comes with two UNSC Spartans that look identical to Master Chief. Both are painted green, black and have golden visors. They both have a peg hole on the back to hold a weapon. These Spartans have a lot of detail and look great in the warthog due to similar colors.<br /><br />Covenant Figures: The set comes with one Covenant Elite Zealot. It is painted red and gray. It has a peg hole on its back to hold a weapon.<br /><br />Weapons: The set comes with multiple weapons. A black UNSC Assault Rifle with good detail. A tiny black UNSC Sticky Detonator with great detail. A big green UNSC Spartan Laser is also included. A purple Covenant Carbine is included with the set and is the only Covenant weapon included. All the UNSC weapons can be put into a peg hole on the back of a figure to hold it.<br /><br />Ordinance Drop Pod: It's difficult to open and close. It has three holes in it to securely fit a weapon. It fits the Spartan Rifle fine. The handle of the UNSC guns go into the hole securely holding the gun. I could only fit one gun securely at a time but could fit more if you just put them in there.<br /><br />Forerunner Structure: It is built on a brown base. The structure has four parts that fold up and down. The actual beam is a blue translucent piece and it is inserted into a translucent blue circular piece. The beam piece is very loose and falls off easily.<br /><br />Halo 4 Warthog: This warthog is amazing. It's a normal turrent warthog, not a rockethog or gausshog. The warthog has been redesigned and matches the Halo 4 Warthhog design. It is mainly painted green, silver, and black. The warthog can fit three Spartans. Two in the seats and one controlling the turrent. The warthog's turrent rotates 360 degrees. It has an ammo belt and box. There is a bullet shield on the turrent as well. It also pivots up and down. The antenna piece is bendable. This warthog also has four gas canisters and the warthog has a platform that holds these as well. The tires roll fine.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great set. It comes with three figures. It also comes with Halo 4 Warthog and a forerunner structure. It comes with four weapons and four gas canisters.ld on the turrent as well. It also pivots up and down.

B006JSXYPA|4.0|The 3D in this movie is one of the bests there is out there but it could have been better, no much things comes out of the screen, it is just not as good as the 3D use in Avenger or the amazing Avatar.<br />Any way I always enjoy watching this movie packed with great special effects, action and 3D view.
0763644765|4.0|My two year old loves this book. It has really helped to get him excited about toilet training. Would recommend to anyone who is toilet training their toddler :)
B002NZV68U|5.0|One of the great stories of all time.  Children love it!  Me, too! A must for all ages even grandparents!

B006H3MJ7G|5.0|His voice is amazing, a great singer accompanied by bachata music. All songs are great and are fantastic to dance too!
B00DGNOMB6|3.0|No plot surprises & simple plot.  Characters believable.  Good acting. Best part was the music and incredible scenery.  I was intrigued by the concept of a home for retired musicians.  A Google search found there are several real ones around the world.
B00AS1Q93S|5.0|We saw this move in the theater and loved it.  Surprised hubby with his own copy.  It's a very nice price and the supplier was super.  Shipped very quickly.
0792839749|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie when it was first out in the theaters.  I particularly enjoy &#34;The Old Bamboo&#34; with Dick Van Dyke singing and dancing with some incredible male dancers.
B004LWZW9C|4.0|It is well done.  When I don't feel so well put together, this is one of my 'go to' movies.  The stories are completed.  It is sweet & funny.  The settings are interesting and well portrayed.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|As I write this review of Stephen King's 850 page fictional account, \\"11/22/63\\", it is 9/1/13 less than 3 months before the 50th anniversary of JFK's assassination.  Soon we will be inundated with newspaper and web articles, TV news specials, etc. etc.  Did Oswald do it or not? Was he alone? What would have likely happened in the ensuing years had Oswald missed?  King addresses all these questions and others in this time travel based story of life in Dallas in the early 60's, and despite its fictional basis, it is an excellent recollection of the events and emotions surrounding 11/22/63.<br /><br />King of course has a strong identity with horror fiction, though there is no ghoulish horror in this book. Many reviewers have labeled \\"11/22/63\\" a love story, and while love is a critical element of the book, I think it is a lot more than 'just' a love story.  Much of the book deals with how the past impacts our lives, and the extent to which fate or destiny leads us to major and unexpected crossroads in our lives. Sometimes we can decide which way to go at these crossroads.  And at some of these crossroads, we no longer have the option to continue straight, nor to make the slightly less desirable turn to the right. Rather, we must take the unknown detour to the left, and simply deal with it.<br /><br />High School teacher Jake Epping doesn't worry very much about crossroads early on in the story.  Jake is single and enjoys his job and Maine where he has lived all his life.  Then Jake is told by a dying acquaintance of a time tunnel from the current 2011 back to the late 1950's.  Once there, Jake can change the course of people's lives, but he cannot foretell all the consequences, bad and good.  And the past doesn't want to be changed.....unexpected hurdles for Jake will crop up.  When first presented in the story, the pathway to the past and the rules of time travel seem a bit hokey, but King is such an excellent writer, that the reader quickly stops looking at the trees and starts viewing the forest.<br /><br />After an experimental trip and return to the present, Jake becomes focused on only one thing - saving the life of JFK.  He is not sure how he will do this, and he explores several options.  Along the way, Jake meets Sadie and falls in love - not in the plan. And now Jake has two objectives, saving JFK and building a life plan  with Sadie.<br /><br />I am always reluctant to tackle a book that exceeds 500 pages, and something 850 pages is almost always a no-no for me.  As expected, there were sections where the story dragged a bit, but not many. And there is so much detail about the 50's and the everyday pleasures of life in the 50's (including the absence of cell phones) that many of us alive in those days will reflect back happily on our own memories. And there are the happy days with Sadie.....And then at about the two-thirds point, I started to speculate on how the book might end.  I put the book down and drafted up a number of my own possible endings.<br /><br />But Stephen King in't predictable. I wasn't close with any of my scenarios, but when I was finished with the book I was very satisfied and delighted to have read it, all 850 pages.s and starts viewing the forest.<br /><br />After an experimental trip and return to the present, Jake becomes focused on only one thing - saving the life of JFK.

B008NC1LJ6|5.0|If you're a fan of not being able to predict a movie & like something a little different, this is a great one.
B00E1L9N8E|4.0|Although this adaptation goes a bit over the top in capturing the opulence and decadence of the golden era, I still can't get over the vibrant color, and detail infused in the landscape, decor, and attire of every scene; Truly a work of art. The cast does an excellent job of capturing the essence of the original work. I held back a star for the music and choreography, which seemed bit contemporary for the quintessential classic of the roaring 20s. I've always been captivated by the music and dance of the jazz age, and was a little disappointed they weren't better represented in the film.
B007DIQC90|5.0|This album, from Finnish artists, has wonderful harmonies and instruments. If you like Arcade Fire, this is a slightly different vein, but you will enjoy. The words are some of the most beautiful poetry too-- some will leave you feeling hopeful, others melancholy.
B005H0IW76|5.0|Michael Bubl&eacute; has truly done a fantastic job on this album. As someone who has spent every Christmas listening to the classics from artists like Johnny Mathis, Bing Crosby, Frank Sinatra, and the like, I was thrilled to listen to this music. I was immediately taken on a trip through Nostalgialand upon hearing it - Bubl&eacute; is an honor and tribute to artists who have come before while still maintaining his own unique style. It is nice to know that the music from Christmas past is still going strong today with Bubl&eacute;. If the Christmas classics appeal to you, then I would definitely recommend this album. Buy it used from a reputable seller and save yourself a few dollars and continue to enjoy the Christmas season with Michael Bubl&eacute;. Blessings!
B009FB3XTA|4.0|I'm a big Twlight fan. It's embarassing, I know. I've been rolling with it for a few years now, so I'm used to the bullying, and surviving. This music does not blind you with sparkling chested vampire men or shiny-muscled wolf-boys. The music is the full lengths of songs that are simply sampled on the movie (um, duh). If you like fairly trendy and newish artists, you'll like this. It's not hard to listen to and not particularly challenging. There are more bada$$ artists out there....they don't do Twilight. I liked it for a roadtrip. It was peppy.
B002PEP4SC|4.0|A fun, quick fix for Castle fans!  I wish it had been a little longer but that means I just have to download the next book.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This series is awesome. Even if you're not into sci-fi, the concept of colonialism, power, corruption, family, protection, romance...these are wonderful to watch. This show is entertaining and the cast superb. Firefly is just great.
0439023521|3.0|The series is entertaining.  Got this for my grandson, who also enjoyed it.  The rating reflects how he feels about the plot and its unfolding.  No dislikes.

The anxiety and necessity for food for family and self is used by the warring/competing powers that be to manipulate people. * In the U.S. & other so called developed countries, accessibility for food is somewhat modified by government programs such as food stamps.

B00571F26Y|5.0|This is a great book.  I'm not 100% wheat free but rather at about 95% wheat free.  I don't have celiac disease or any other disease that  prevents wheat consumption but I've found by following this diet 95% of the time that my cravings for junk food have greatly diminished.  I'm continuing to lose weight and am enjoying the fact that those cravings for junk food have disappeared.

B00BFUUMO8|5.0|One of the best free games you can download, with a little time and patience you can level up without spending any real money. Fortunately I have not had any problems like some have had with bugs in the game. I play a few minutes each day and I still want to play after a few weeks without losing interest. All in all a great free app. 5 stars
B003OF3R0S|4.0|I wouldn't call this their best but it is far from the worst.  I enjoy rocking out to it and look forward to future albums.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|Excellent ,goes with me wherever i am i have it on my phone and also on my tablet .it is my life line to God
B009YP9L7U|1.0|I never leave negative reviews but I had to with this book. It should have been titled &#34;Manipulation, Mind Games, and Emotional Abuse.&#34; I wanted to like the characters but Conner was just plain creepy. I was half expecting him to resort to physial violence or rape. I actually felt afraid for Megan at times. I wanted to like Megan but I just kept thinking of how incredibly stupid she was to let a man play such mind games with her and force himself on her so much. If the author intended for Conner to be some heart throb she definitely missed the mark. He was nothing but creepy and manipulative. I did not want poor Megan to end up with him.<br /><br />The writing in this book was not very good either. There were multiple places in the book where the writing was confusing. For example, in chapter  16, I believe, the author jumps between several situations that leave readers confused. You can make out what she intended, but I am sure many readers would be confused. I could list dozens of other examples of poor writing. I will not be reading any more books by this author.
B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|Works pretty well and the lights are very cool. Maybe it's because I'm a girl game because it seems sort of tall/big for my hand. I'm sure this was probably created for men so I'm not surprised to find that I have a hard time holding it. It's rather disappointing. Other than that, I still use the product and think the buttons work well.
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|I love this game. It is challenging and gives your brain a workout. I strongly recommend this game especially if you like Solitaire.
B000ENV5WK|3.0|It said it was NTSC but was actually PAL so we're looking for someone to convert it now. Other than that it was ok!

B00CT2P6VA|5.0|I wish it were longer.  This is a strategy game. Some of the screens are a snap to figure out, and some are very difficult.  I get frustrated with the harder ones, because there are no instructions, although they do offer a hint, which is sometimes helpful, and sometimes not.  I would purchase this again, because I have enjoyed it so much.  That is why I'm giving it 5 stars
B00B7Y0206|1.0|paid money for it to be add free and the app doesn't even work.  waste of money,  i don't recommend it
B00BTM29LQ|5.0|A truly wonderful book that is brimming with pointers that silence the mind. A great book to start with along with 'Pointers from Nisargadatta Maharaj' by Ramesh S. Balsekar which is also a remarkable book.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|I really connected with this book. Tribal, minimal, natural. Humanity - the far running being. Inspiring and worth the time and money.<br /><br />I did wonder, though - if vegetarianism is the way of elite ultra running but humanity developed ultra running capabilities to become successful persistence hunters to feed large brains with protein, is there a contradiction in the argument made here?
B003TTH4IU|5.0|Each episode brings you deeper into the lives of the characters, and I can hardly wait for the next episode
B005DJREJS|5.0|I thought that it was going to be geared for a younger crowd.  But, I am 29 and found myself watching the episodes one after another!
B00CLL1UY6|5.0|Sebastian, by Christoph Fischer, is the sweeping second installment of the Three Nations Trilogy. Amazingly, it is even more compelling than the first volume, The Luck of the Weissensteiners.<br /><br />The setting of Sebastian is Vienna, shortly before The Great War. When the doctor, who had served in the field during the Balkan War, declares part of Sebastian Schreiber's leg must be amputated, it's a blow to the intelligent sixteen-year-old boy. A subsequent amputation results in the loss of more of his leg and sets Sebastian on a course which will impact the rest of his life.<br /><br />The family continues on with trials and tribulations, including a romance between the shop assistant that had to hired because of Sebastian's health issues and Franz, Sebastian's father. Soon after, The Great War begins, with its global ramifications and the more immediate impact on Sebastian's family when Franz is sent to the Serbian front.<br /><br />Margit is hired to help in the shop. While clumsy and preoccupied, she tries hard. After Margit offers Sebastian unselfish and quiet comfort, Sebastian falls in love with her.<br /><br />The epic saga follows the family drama and the effect of war on the family. The writing is descriptive of not only the time in history but also of feelings and emotions. I unreservedly recommend the book.
B000QCS8TW|4.0|Read the book, you won't be disappointed. It's still fun after watching the show. Not great literature, but a still a good read.
B00B22ASUM|4.0|A good story about a man trying to survive life while working his way  back from his addiction. An absolutely amazing cat story and one that will capture the hearts of cat lovers everywhere. If you have ever had an orange cat that stole your heart, this is a must read.
B000MKD9P6|4.0|I am really going to put a different spin on this movie than previous reviewers did.<br /><br />I've been in situations where I needed a job, finally landed something that was less-than-ideal, and had to rise to the challenge. As I see it, that's what the main character did, and brilliantly. I don't get that she was in love with fashion, just that she got her act together, trimmed her hair, and showed up dressed appropriately for the position. As for the boss, she demanded excellence from herself, therefore demanded excellence from her employees.<br /><br />I've had bosses who were true devils, who didn't actually set a good example, one who never bathed or wore clean clothes and screamed at me for mistakes I didn't even make and sexually harassed me, and one who demanded a meeting wherein he repeated himself over and over again, trying to get me to agree with him about one point, hoping to wear me down uhtil I caved. And that's just two examples. The boss in this movie is a superachiever who sets a sterling example, wants what she wants and is precise. Oh well, we're not at work to paint each other's toenails, right? She da boss. Life in the big city.<br /><br />As far as the ethics question, if your job is on the line and your boss tells you to do something or else you will lose your job, well, that doesn't leave much of a choice, correct? I mean, eventually, I left all my jobs from hell, but in the meantime, I had to suck it up so I wouldn't end up unemployed. I think her friends could have been less judgemental, because the job at the fashion magazine did eventually lead to the job she really wanted; she was just paying her dues in the meantime, like we all do -- and paying the rent.<br /><br />It's an unfortunate reality that there are a lot of bosses from hell (God knows I've had my share). It would be great if we could all take the high road, leave the difficult job, and land the dream job 5 minutes later, like in the movies. But that's why we watch movies, right? For that glimpse of hope that maybe we'll get the dream job soon.<br /><br />I liked this movie because the main character rose to the challenge, and surpassed it; that was cool to watch. She certainly was less frumpy at the end of the movie; she had found her style, somewhere between casual and over-the-top glam. Even tho I'm not a fashionista, the clothes were fun to watch, and NY is always good to see.
B003XVYLDU|5.0|This book has always been and remains controversial. It has been banned, burned and generally condemned. (Look in Wikipedia for  the comments of the learned judge who banned it in the early seventies). It is nevertheless a masterpiece and is today regarded as one of the greatest books of the last century. A work of great significance, and with Catch 22 the finest book inspired by the second world war.<br /><br />I have read this book many times and with each reading I never cease to marvel at the strange power and beauty of the writing. Love it or hate it is Vonnegut's masterpiece and must be read by any serious reader. It is not pretty but as a searing inditement of the sheer horror of war and the people who play their part in it it stands alone.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I really enjoyed the characters and the way their stories all intertwined.  A great book to bring to the beach--a quick read!
B00AHDXTIK|5.0|Extra long cable and works for charging and does sync as well great price and fast shipping works great as needed
B004IFD9HE|4.0|My kid loved this movie, and it was funny enough for me to watch it too! Worth the time to check it out.
B0030IIZ4M|5.0|I bought this for my  5yr old grandson who liked it as much as my daughter did when she was younger.
B0037NB6QE|5.0|Blossom Street series were the first books I started reading and loved it. I am now reading all the Cedar Cove series which just as wonderful
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Hi there! I'm 10 yrs old, and I loved this book! I especially enjoyed how each chapter is told by a different person. I highly recommend this book for children like me in the fifth or sixth grade.
B00BWWS81S|5.0|Been waiting for the new KT album since scarlet tulip was released a few years ago. This continues her new found folkie ways and when combined with her talent for songwriting, you have a great album. Her guitar playing is flawless and if you know KT, her voice is strong as ever with some continued maturity showing in her lyrics and singing. Excellent album with some memorableand intriguing songs.
B002RI9S2Y|4.0|This book is very different to the movie, I actually think I prefer the movie more, only really because that Percy in the book is 12, while in the movie he is about 16/17 and to be wondering around America by themselves 12yr olds hmm....<br />Great ideas for a story though....
B0064MGU98|5.0|I loved the fact I was able to view this on Amazon Prime. I never seen the show on tv and was addicted within minutes of watching the first episode. Stellar acting, great cast and intriguing storyline. I love this show! It is my guilty pleasure.
B00004WPDA|5.0|I've read a lot of comments good and bad about the Anthology vinyl albums. If you are looking for a Beatles compilation, but, don't have other Beatles albums, you may be disappointed as many of the tracks are direct recordings from radio appearances or live appearances. Some sound very good, others a B or B+, and a couple early recordings are rough and distant. There are just enough studio versions in this package to make me happy, and I don't mind them being alternate versions (as I have the original versions already in my Beatles vinyl collection). These Anthology studio versions have fantastic analog warm, rich spine tingling sound. In the past, Apple has not always been good to me as I got new albums that were warped or had loud pops, or fizz right out of the package, but, these three albums were very good. They include studio quality recordings \\"Free as a Bird,\\" along with some you may never have heard the Beatles do like \\"Searchin,\\" \\"Like Dreamers Do,\\" \\"Hello Little Girl,\\" and \\"How Do You Do It.\\" Also included are studio quality alternate versions of \\"One after 909,\\" and \\"Eight Days a Week.\\" As a big fan, I had a great time listening to these recordings. If you are looking for vinyl compilations of original releases, I would look on Amazon for used LP's. The new remasters are digitized before transferring to vinyl and they sound too much like a CD to me, missing the 3 dimensional headroom of pure analog. I guess record companies still do not understand their customers or these would be direct transfers from the analog master tapes with no digitization at all. There are many used mint Beatles albums out there if you have the time to search. Unopened analog vinyl (from the 1960's to the 90's) can be found as well, but, may cost a lot. ADDENDUM: In 2014, Apple/EMI issued Mono Masters that are not digitized in any way. I bought them all and I am extremely satisfied with the all analog sound.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I loved all the books, this one is no exception. It actually gets better and I would recommend it to everyone. If you wonder if the series is worth watching if you watched the TV show, then yes, it is. I started with the show and then bought all the books and read them in a matter of 4 or 5 weeks. It's this kind of addictive books you can't stop reading. Trust me, Mr Martin is awesome.
1451695195|4.0|The book was purchased for my wife who likes it a lot. I haven't read the book though my self.
B00009R86L|5.0|Like a reviewer before me, I wonder why the manufacturers of messenger bags don't include shoulder pads like this one. Nevertheless, I now own the Domke 725-310 FA-031 and I couldn't be happier. The padding is more than adequate, its design prevents the bag from slipping off the shoulder and actually makes a stuffed bag feel lighter than it is. Perfect! If you have back issues, sore shoulders or just want to lighten your load, I heartily recommend this product.
1451695195|3.0|Interesting story.  I guess I have read several similar stories and I didn't get as excited about it as a lot of other people did.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is really addict. I even got my bf into it I like it very much keeps me busy while I am bored
B001B92E5I|5.0|And now with the warm sound of vinyl.  One of my favorites and at a great price too! if you love gaslight anthem grab one of these and see for yourself.
B00BH0VSM6|4.0|Nesbo is a very good story teller with good pace and plot. Maybe a touch verbose is establishing Harry for readers at times, but done with anticipation at chapters endings leading to the promise of climax. The main problem for me is that halfway through, I surmised who the killer was.
B008FQ1O1K|3.0|After having read &#34;The five people you meet in heaven&#34; my expectations were sky high. And somewhat dissapointed! The plot of a man from ancient times, who is punished by God(s) for having invented time keeping is close to genious. The irony of having to spend eternity observing what his invention does to the human race, fully immune to time, is beautifull. The story and the narrating are well composed and easy to follow, also for a non-native English reader. The story, told in present, keeps the suspense, even though as a reader you feel you know something the people in the book doesn´t - only you can´t figure out what it is!<br /><br />As a person living in our modern day, the reader is living the same conditions as the book - this is the story of all of us, and one will feel the burden of the invention of time. You see, how man has become a slave to something only an idea. So the wisdom of the book is undeniable. I am, as a reader, compelled to think about my own relationship to time and what I hold dear in my own life. And also, the deeper questions of meaning and existential freedom, that M. Albom so excelled in in &#34;The five peole you meet in heaven.&#34;<br /><br />However, I only give 4 stars for the story because of the ending, which dissapointed me (no spoilers to follow), and the fact that I know Mitch Albom can do better substracts another star, leaving me with only 3 stars. The second half of the book, where father time is sent out to redeem his sin, simply does not live up to the rest. Especially the ending is a bit hasty, as if the writer ran out of paper (or time...?.). I wish he would republish with a better worked through point!. None the less, the book offers a chance to give some consideration to important topics. Just do it while you read - don´t wait till after you finish.
B005CGI4EG|5.0|This is going to be a great surprise gift for my husband for Christmas.  Great price.  I recommend this product.
B000SVZIR6|5.0|THIS MOVE HAS THE MOST BREATHTAKING SCENERY, IT IS JUST BEAUTIFUL.  CHOW YUN-FAT DOES A GOOD JOB PLAYING THE ROLE ORIGINALLY DONE BY THE INCREDIBLE YUL BRYNNER.  JODIE FOSTER IS WONDERFUL, WONDERFUL MOTHER, STRICT BUT LOVING TEACHER, AND ABOVE ALL, A LONELY AND VULNERABLE WIDOW.  THE KING'S CHILDREN ARE ADORABLE...
B004SH40BQ|1.0|Doesn't work!  Turn on the I POD, turn on my BOSE Soundlink, push play on the I POD, the Bluetooth lights flash on the BOSE and the KOKIA and...nothing happens!  Tried it over and over again...still nothing! Read the instructions over and over, still nothing.  The BOSE works great with my new nano but not with my older 160 classic...which is what I thought this was for.
B00866JL96|5.0|MY HUSBAND REALLY LOVES THIS MOVIE, BELIEVE IT OR NOT.  HE IS A BIG, STRONG CORRECTIONS OFFICER, GO FIGURE.  MAYBE BECAUSE ZAC'S CHARACTER WAS IN THE MILITARY AND MY HUSBAND WAS IN A RANGER BATTALION.  GOOD STORY, GREAT TO WATCH THE MOVIE WITH SOMEONE YOU LOVE
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Amazon does it for me again<br />lovin my Kindle for Android<br />Old loyal kindles miss me<br />but progress made me wander.
B004GYY714|5.0|not much to tell<br />I can hear lots of radios from all over the world and it seems to require very little of my band.
B005Z271Y6|5.0|If you have not seen this concert, you are really missing out. Seeing it on Blu-Ray is even better. Highly recommended.
B000XUBC5E|5.0|excellent as all his books are - suspenseful and great reading<br />His characters are enjoyable and I love it is based in NJ or NY where I am  familiar
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|This is a wonderful beginning point for anyone discovering that beliefs precede reality and the divine miracles that each of us are capable of.
0765337541|5.0|My soon thought it was a good read. He's not interested reading much but said that this book kept his interest. He can't wait til the movie comes out so he can compare.
B0082FPIY8|4.0|A great story, sad in many ways and yet a triumph for those that have to guts to go out and git it!
B003UYUQZW|5.0|It is an imaginative story.  I had to have it after seeing it a couple of times on broadcast TV.  The critics are snobs!
B001GST11O|5.0|Stellar video 2 cds and great 2 cd music cds.  Great song choices. Solid guitar work.  A piece of time to own.
B0002BO05S|5.0|The subtleties in this movie are priceless.  I have seen a lot of these movies about Jesus.  This is definitely the best!  The Passion is very well done too, but I am too &#34;chicken&#34; to watch all the torture.  This movie gets the point across without nauseating my modern stomach.
B001TCHDPS|4.0|I enjoy music, more than most people who say they enjoy music.  I like knowing facts like who is Ian Stewart (look it up I did) after listening to L.Z. one day.  But had know idea about this musician until watching the movie.  Ordered both CD's right away and have enjoyed them a lot.  Funny how some people make it big, and others just don't get the break.  Timing, Karma, Luck, who knows but glad I now know about Rodriquez.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|I was not familiar with this story, but my husband was.  We both love this action packed movie immensely.  it is another underestimated picture.

B003UYV08E|4.0|This is second of a series!  Robert Downey knocked the ball out of the park.  I just don't like this story line as much as the first one.  I haven't seen the third one yet.
B008KP2VZY|3.0|A lot of features (sync, webmaster,...)<br />It works fine  with Google drive and MS Skydrive but i have issue with Box (can't set a sync).<br />The UI could also be improved. It's clearly a potential 5 starts app.
B00004SZWB|5.0|Hotter than July is the title song.  It is a tribute to Dr. Martin Luther King done in a Reggae beat.  It is very imaginative as is all of Stevie's music.  I recommend it highly.
B001L1S1SK|5.0|This is a fantastic show and, just as expected, this product allows us to watch it whenever we might want to.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|The story is great!  I hope the next Batman is as good as Christian Bale when he plays in the Man of Steel sequel.
B003F3NDOE|5.0|I've watched the whole Ugly Betty series and this set allows me to do so again whenever I want to.
B004G600A4|5.0|You would think this story is aimed at women and girls.  My husband found this to be hilarious!  It is told from the man's viewpoint.  There is a lot of action as well.  Nice take on Rapunzel, Disney!
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Works well for the regular ol' Kindle. My original charger stopped working so Amazon provided me with a credit to buy a new one for free.
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|Yep!  I'm one of them!  I am a died in the wool fan!  This collection was a &#34;must have&#34; for me.  Well done!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I love this game. Even though I'm a boy. I love how you can connect with friends and check their status. As I go through the game I like more and more  of the ponys.
B00004ZDVQ|5.0|I am a fan of Stevie Wonder from the days when he was &#34;Little&#34; Stevie Wonder.  I will be buying more.  As I said.  I don't have to cover my ears from the garbage being produced now.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|This is one of those games you can play with a little or a lot of time. It is always fun and gets to be pretty challenging. I do a few of these every night before bed. The graphics are great and keep me interested. It is a low stress game because you complete the puzzles on your own time (not timed) and don't have to do it perfectly to be able to move on to the next level. I love it.
B00C7JGDBW|5.0|I like the comedic interpretation of the Wizard by James Franco and the transformation to the Wicked Witch of the West portrayed by Mila Kunis.
B0058OUJA4|2.0|I got this as the Free App of the Day and I'm certainly glad I didn't pay $2.99 for it.  I've never played a game in this genre before, so I figured I'd try it for something different.  I find the game play to be a bit on the boring side.  You position turrets to try and shoot things coming through a maze towards a goal.  And, it seems like, no matter how many turrets you put up, some of the things still make it through, which can be frustrating.  That frustration alone makes this not even that good as a time waster.  The grapics are OK, nothing to get really excited about, but that also makes the app pretty lightweight.  All in all, this game failed to really impress me and I doubt it will be staying on my tablet very long.  It's definitely not worth $3, in my opinion.
B000VDDDVO|5.0|I played the VCR version every Christmas and wore it out.  I had it for years.  DVD is better so of course I love it.  Most of the family still has non digital TV's so we are not limited to the computer screen for viewing.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Great book through my eyes and I understand this book more then any other book I've read that deals with stories like this
B0034G4P80|5.0|Not only is Chris Hemsworth handsome, but he can act.  He was totally different from other roles he played, like Kirk's dad in Star Trek.  You can see how this story ties into the Avengers.  Sorry Natalie Portman did not follow Chris to that movie.
B003DNN0L2|5.0|Fantastic Mr. Fox is an amazing film, the experience was tarnished when I couldn't even watch it because according to amazon there were too many streams of it when I only had the one. I ended up having to stream it for free from another site.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|Hurry up with the second pic!  I just loved this one.  It brought all the Marvel heroes together.  Captain America had the best lines in the story in my opinion!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Couldn't put it down...I laughed, cried, and did sobbed while laughing. You will never forget Augustus Waters...or Hazel...they will forever be in my list of favorite characters.
B001ASVXSE|5.0|My hobby (in its infancy, admittedly) is collecting classical music.  I found my library with a glaring hole in the violin literature and this was the box set I decided to buy.  I was not disappointed.<br /><br />The recordings are consistently brilliant - Oistrakh's recordings of the Brahms, Beethoven, and Prokofiev concerti are spectacular.  I've been listening to the Katchachurian on repeat for the last week.  In particular, Oistrakh has a particular intensity of sound that I have not found in other performers; the openings (and rest of the concerti, for that matter) of the Brahms and Katchachurian are unlike any other recordings I've ever heard.  In addition, there are a number of chamber performances which all beautiful; my first encounter with the Prokofiev violin sonatas came from Oistrakh.<br /><br />In summary, if you are looking for one set that provides a masterful introduction to violin music, this is it.  17 CD's for ~$50 is difficult to beat.
B009MYARIK|5.0|Love Sophie Kinsella's style and variety - have not missed a book yet.  Her style is light-hearted, delightful and fast moving.  Another great read....
B00DI75SWM|3.0|Works well but when I have  to set as background image it says that my application has stopped and will just move on to carousel.
B0001US62I|5.0|Mickey Rourke was the only actor who I think could have played Harry Angel so convincingly.  His deterioration was visceral and scary.  Perfectly cast.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I play bingo blitz to unwind after work. It is fun and relaxing but I wish that the htgs would come up more often.
B005ISQ7JM|1.0|It is a teaser.  You need to upgrade and paid before you can read the book.  The book is absolutely not free.
B000B8IA2G|5.0|It's a great movie that brings out a side of Stargate that I can sit down and enjoy for as long as I want to watch tv without getting bored.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|I watched the entire set in two days, not one glitch, and was completely satisfied! hahahah! glad i bought it
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Great game to pass the time. Really enjoy this game. Levels are actually difficult some times. Like that it has different features.
B006S08RLU|5.0|The movie kept me on my toes. Amilie is a really unique, funny, intriguing approach to a typical love story.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Love this series. Read it before but came back for another visit after seeing the first movie. It got me all over again just as it dud the first time.
B0071BY1PG|4.0|The BD of KFP is awesome.  I saw reviews about how well the sound editing and surround effects was on this disc, and it was accurate.  BD video is top notch, and it's movies like these that make the BD format really worth it.  The only reason I don't give this a five is knowing a 5 is the perfect BD and awesome as this is, I don't think its perfect yet.
B003F3PMYI|5.0|Finally, real evidence that backs up what we learned from Stephen Covey and Susan Steinbrechner! Many of us knew it - but hopefully now with so much scientific backing more people will try it in their personal lives and work lives.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|It is rare to find something that engages the whole family, including two teenagers.  Well done in every aspect.  Just great.
B00BJTGVTK|5.0|\\"Tall Tales for Short People\\" comes in handy when you have kids of different ages. There are a variety of stories in this book, and you can clearly see which stories are written for which age-group.<br /><br />Some stories play with familiar settings of fairy tales, like \\"A New Job\\" or \\"The Bottle\\" providing recognition of some of the characters for the kids while delivering a new and original story. Some of the stories, like \\"Jungle Music,\\" are really suited even for toddlers, with simple imagery, concepts, and sounds; some, like the lead story, \\"Josh's Scary Night,\\" will work for slightly older kids.<br /><br />There are stories in here that parents would like as well: \\"A Magical Dinner,\\" \\"The Time Machine,\\" and \\"A Life-Saving Invention,\\" to name a few.<br /><br />Surprisingly, my favorite story from this collection was \\"Little Dragonfly.\\" While it's clearly written for younger kids, I found myself rather enjoying reading it. It was giving up a flavor of an African folktale, very enjoyable.<br /><br />It was fascinating to see how the language was adapted to the type of a story and the age group for which the story is intended. A very good collection of stories that will grow up with your kids.
B003WUYRGI|1.0|Hate it it was dum and stupid to read. I think you should not read it DO NOT READ! Please
B00ECU34ZM|2.0|Nice special effects. But a familiar twist to story. We've seen this before. Memory and betrayal are always interesting.<br />Humans destroyed by a superior intelligence we don't get any insight into.
0062202081|5.0|excellent
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I really enjoyed this series.  Actually a relative was hooked on the series and I decided to try it out.  From the beginning the characters drew me in.  The acting and writing are both excellent.
B004EFYZ1C|5.0|I love moon phase apps, and this one's definitely one of the better ones I've tried. I especially like being able to set the realistic moon graphic as my tablet's wallpaper.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is awesome. Hands down keeps you addicted. Don't really have any complaints about this. My advice is to not buy anything in the beginning with the coins. Let them add up
0399255370|5.0|I purchased this book after having read a review in The Wallstreet Journal. I was thrilled with the concept (encouraging kids to be creative and &#34;thinking outside the box.&#34;) and the whimsical writing; so thrilled in fact, I purchased three copies! I wrapped each one together with a box of crayons and a pad of drawing paper for three special recipients (all three year olds). Each of them LOVED it! My grandson was immediately engaged in the story of Duncan and his rebellious crayons. We read it again, and again, and again the first few days he had it. I HIGHLY recommend this book for the 3+ year old set.
B008Y1YJ90|5.0|Great heartfelt movie for kids and adults. Lots of adult humor and innuendos that will keep you and the kids entertained. Really a quality movie to be watched year after year!
B007MAETA8|5.0|I love this CD...went to see John Mayer in concert with Phillip Phillips and now love his music.  There are a couple of songs I skip over but for the most part all the songs are good.
B00EDF43MY|3.0|The game is cute but repetitive. It is only for kids, very young kids. There are also not a lot of instructions so figuring out what to do is difficult.
B001DJLD1M|5.0|They made this trilogy then broke the mold. Everyone HAS to see 'The Matrix' at least once in their life- you just HAVE to!
B005COO1X6|4.0|Outer space monster eating people and only a child has seen and survived. Creepy story short but scary. No stopping at deserted rest areas for me.
B003BW0CB6|5.0|I love all the books that involve both Mickey Haller and Harry Bosch, and this is definitely the best of those.  I cannot recommend it highly enough.

B009AY04A8|2.0|The game is slow and drawn  out. I did not like searching in the dark. At the end it just stopped , I would have like a little more positive response to the gaming.
B00AHGSVKS|4.0|This is my second read of Childhoods End.  The last time was ~40 years ago.  Arthur C Clark weaves a very enjoyable story the contents of which describe a of the technological benefits we enjoy today and talk of a potential world order we do not enjoy today but many would like.
1401922732|5.0|I love these cards and find them very comforting and inspirational.  Sometimes I just pull a card to set the mood for the day. Sometimes I have something on my mind or heavy on my heart and I pull a card or two for guidance.  I love them
B004LPLU4K|5.0|I love this story, its awesome.  There's nothing wrong with a happy ending and this one has a delightful one.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Michael Connelly superbly does it again with another Harry Bosch mystery. I was kept at the edge of my seat as Detective Bosch works through another cold case and balancing his personal life with his teenaged daughter. There were no superfluous relationships or background information that result in stories to drag on needlessly.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This app is so fun even if there is limited characters and stuff I still think it's fun and its great for anyone.
B00AQB2A3I|4.0|It's great writing and great playing, it's arranged very well, all of the things we've come to expect from Steven Wilson's many projects. I like the mellotron; it adds a certain vibe that you can't capture with anything else, and it wasn't overused. Outstanding musicianship overall. But for my money, I wish I could just remove the woodwinds. To me, they just don't add anything that needs to be there, and they are overused. To my ears they're just an unnecessary distraction and again, there is just too much of it. A great rhythm section, great guitarist, the usual keyboards and ambience, and I just wanted to hear these guys play as only they can, and then I hear this flute that seems so out of place. Not helping, not at all. And the overbearing sax didn't do anything for me, either. Please don't do this again. Let the cats play and leave the hippy-dippy crap to someone else. Please!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Definitely one of my favorite books! I bought it on my Kindle, but plan to one day buy the physical book! Great style of writing. I was doubtful at first because I realized the story was told from the perspective of Death, but it proved to be an amazing work of literature! If you're considering this book right now, absolutely get it. You won't be sorry.
0385523394|3.0|Is it called a memoir when it covers only one aberrant chapter of a life?<br />It was kind of like gossiping with friends: momentarily entertaining, but little or no take-away.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Love this series and can't wait for the next book to download to kindle .Love it love it love it...
0060832819|5.0|... I read this with great interest at first but the piece is not the sum of it's parts  but sadly turns out to be an exotic buffet of New Age narcissism ...
B004KPQK2S|4.0|My 6 yr old liked this movie but this movie did not keep my 4 year olds attention very long.
B000NIVJEU|5.0|Great movie. The quality is great. This is a great movie for the whole family. Highly recommended. It's a<br />Great movie.
B00005AAFS|5.0|There are not too many artists who can have 3 albums in a row sound good, let alone great, but Rammstein is in a league of it's own!! Mutter is a much more serious sounding album to me, and you will notice a lot less synthesizers than their previous 2 albums (Herzeleid and Sehnsucht), but this album shows the amazing progression of Rammstein as an artist, and I love it a lot.<br /><br />The tracks included on Mutter are: Mein herz brennt, links 2,3,4, sonne, ich will, feuer frei, mutter, spieluhr, zwitter, rein raus, adi&oacute;s and nebel. As I mentioned earlier, the songs on Mutter are much more serious as a whole. Tracks like links 2,3,4 and feuer frei speak about politics and the military, while a track like mutter speaks about more personal issues involving a mother and child. Then there are tracks like mein herz brennt, sonne and zwitter which all feature some of the synthesizers that Rammstein are known for, as well as awesome metal riffs. Then there are the miscellaneous tracks like nebel, which is a beautiful song almost verging on gothic, or adi&oacute;s which is a very fast paced almost punk song.<br /><br />Rammstein blew me away with their first two albums, and Mutter was no exception. With this album Rammstein has shown that they can grow as an artist, while still staying true to their original sound that everyone loves. Mutter is an amazing album, and any true Rammstein fan should own it!!

B00BBA6FOI|5.0|Absolutely fantastic. Can only recommend it. And as Sheryl Sandberg says, it's not only for woman but also for men... Should become mandatory for CEOs, MBA students... oh, just everyone!!!
0064471837|5.0|I first read Sabriel when I was 13, after receiving it for my birthday and I have to say it was one of the most influential books on deciding my favourite genre to this day.<br /><br />To keep this review as spoiler free as possible, Sabriel is about a a young woman finding her true ancestry by traversing a fantasy world she was once part of. A necromancer by blood, Sabriel is, quite often, forced into situations where she must use her skills to help her with her journey; this juxtaposition between life and death and the questionable morality circulating through the novel just add to the dark fantasy atmosphere.<br /><br />All the characters are well-written, my favourites being Sabriel and Mogget: Sabriel is an amazing character, caught between childhood and adulthood, she's a strong female character whose determination and bravery is inspiring throughout. Mogget is one of those grey characters which I find so intriguing to read about; he's both good and bad, but for reasons which are both sinister and amusing.<br /><br />In short, Sabriel is completely different from any fantasy story I've ever read before, it gripped me from start to finish and left me wanting more from that world. When Lirael, Abhorsen and Across the Wall came out, I eagerly bought them and found them just as absorbing. Sabriel is a story anyone can enjoy, as both my parents loved it too! I would even recommend getting the audiobook, Tim Curry's reading of it is an amazing listen.
B0084AVKZW|5.0|My mom read this to me and y sister when we were little.  Even though we couldn't read then, we could always tell when she tried to skip a page.  I read it to my son and then put the book away for many, many years.  Recently re-discovered it and it's wonderful illustrations.  Now I'm reading it aloud to my grandson and he also can tell whenever I try to skip pages.  I'll leave it to others to find deeper meanings in every word.  All I can say is this is wonderful whether you're 6 or 60.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|i drive school bus. sometimes i do activities at nite. i can check in here when i am parked in another place besides home
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Having never seen the show while on air.  I'm very disappointed it was cancelled  Network  corporate types don't seem to know a good thing when they see one.  Great series, I highly recommend it.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Anyone with an interest in flying and WWII will immensely enjoy this true story. It will change how you think about war and you will learn what it means to be human.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|great game!  I love it and you will too, if you love the minions in despicable me!!  very creative and highly addictive.
B0058OUJA4|5.0|This game is very addicting. Its worth the small price for admission. Great for killing time in the airport. Graphics look pretty good.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|It's ten times better than the cable with charger that came with my original one that came with the Kindle. Thanks for sending it!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Amazing and Simple. I wanted another but Amazon has been sold out so I got a second one from google. If you watch youtube, it is a no brainer and worth it just for the implementation
159463176X|3.0|I couldn't wait to read this book after reading the first two but I was a little disappointed because in  comparison it was not as good. Still,worth reading, but doesn't measure up to the first two.
B00CWY76CC|2.0|It was fun but if u got stuck there wasn't any help just instructions. It was expecting more from the game.
B008X9Z37A|4.0|It covers my  tablet and protect it  I would like to stand up .The color is nice also  very rough outer surface
B006GWO5NE|1.0|The reason this item was sent to me was that the one in the box with the new kindle didn't work. The one you sent didn't work either. I was sent a replacement kindle and it works fine but both the original cable and the replacement you sent would not work with the new kindle either. There was probably nothing wrong with the first kkndle if it just had a functioning charge cable. Happy now but your quality control sucks. I would have given this item a lower rating if I had that option.
145210655X|5.0|Definitely for the star wars fan who grew up and had a son.  There also one for Vader and his daughter.  Its definitely for adults, not in terms of inappropriate content or anything.  If you haven't seen and probably loved the original movies, you won't get the references.  A fun birthday or father's day gift for sure.<br /><br />Luke in the book remains a kid (probably 7 - 10 years old) in all the scenes.  The Leia one has her grow from a kid to a teenage daughter, probably because teen daughter give Dad's a big headache.  Very cute.
B009B1UZ7C|5.0|I came across some beautiful songs by Jake Bugg some time ago,<br />and decided to buy the CD, half expecting nothing else on it<br />to be worthwhile. Not so. Every track is excellent and only gets better<br />on repeated listening. The melodic and rhythmic creativity -and judgement<br />as to instrumentation and length- is astounding. (I cannot imagine<br />the co-writers having a very significant hand in this; the musical insight<br />is so extraordinary.) Bugg's achievement is all the bigger as he uses<br />rather minimal means and manages to write accessible songs.<br /><br />I was further amazed when looking into new materials scattered on Youtube.<br />Including the CD this gets you some 30-odd tracks, not one being without<br /> some sublime musical invention (concerning rhythmic energy, melodic development etc.);<br />generally the new songs are even better than the CD. I did not find a single weak song.<br />Bugg takes traditional forms and refreshes them significantly -and sometimes even<br />'blows them up'- `from the inside'. (And almost all covers I found,<br />often of no minor figures, are in my opinion musically better than the originals.)<br />The only parallels that come to mind are to a certain great composer to whom<br />nobody should normally be compared; in my estimation Dylan and Lennon are no match for Bugg,<br />not even close. This will surely sound very overblown -- but Bugg's potential is exceedingly rare.<br />He seems to move across musical history at will, soaking in anything that is good<br />and turning it into something new which is generally better. Utterly fascinating.<br />(I am not normally into contemporary stuff but only into baroque, classical music and good jazz.)
159463176X|2.0|Khaled Hosseini disappointed me on this one.  It seemed like he tried to include way too much and did not<br />connect the young sister and brothers story.  It was more about the uncle.  Conclusion did not tie in very well.
B00DHHWY9I|2.0|The film was well done, but the adaptation with Jay-Z's music into a story that depicts the 20's made the story feel too superficial and likely was only there to capture the teenage audience's attention.  If they would have done an adaptation of modern music using instruments and styles used in the 20s, I think the film would have been more enjoyable.<br /><br />Moulin Rouge and Romeo and Juliet mashed into a classic story.<br /><br />The soundtrack absolutely ruined this film.
B0088W6IMQ|5.0|They should not have taken it off the air.  It was a great show.  We don't have star trek anymore and then this came out and it was awesome and then it was taken off.  Come on guys, bring it back...
B00CW7KK9K|1.0|after many attempts to sync the item to the account apps without success, I returned it. Can't recommend it  to anyone.

B008Y7N7JW|4.0|My only complaint is that the rental time is so short. The quality of the movie was good though, especially for something streamed into my TV and not played through my blu-ray.

B00280LYHS|5.0|What a great last stand! Through Greek mythology and some wonderful additions from the author this book drew me into the pages. I felt as if I had stepped inside on the characters and really loved in those moments. That is the measure of a great book, looking up from the last page and feeling as if you were transported back to your reality from an amazing fictional land. This is worth a read, though it will grab you so intensely you'll have read it in no time. A lovely end to this saga.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Great summer read. I would suggest this book to any reader looking for a wonderful story about family, pain and forgiveness.  This book is just plain and simple, fantastic!
B00ERFCX04|5.0|A new werecat addition to the Monster High world and I am pleased with her.<br /><br />She's a black cat, designed around superstitions. The top of her dress and shoes are meant to mimic broken glass, and in her left ear is a pink \\"13\\" earring after the Friday the 13th superstition (which is her release date at some stores for the U.S.)<br /><br />She is NOT an exclusive doll-She's being released at Walmart, Target, ToysRUs and the like, so she hopefully will be easy for everyone to obtain and not pay outrageous prices.<br /><br />She looks to have the same head mold as Catrine, but she's very striking in her own right. I'm not a huge fan of all the pink: her hair, dress, lips and accessories are all very very Barbie pink. I bought her with the plan to customize her and tone down the overkill (I collect the dolls)<br />I'm sure any little kid who loves pink will love her.<br />She has glittery silver shadow around her eyes which I find to be very pretty. She also comes with the newer doll stand that hugs under the dress, not around the waist.<br /><br />My biggest con is that she has the Indonesian hair which is sticky from the glue, unlike the Chinese made dolls which have much softer and nicer hair. Her hair does shed a bit so gentle with the brush! It also frizzed out at the ends, which I ended up trimming until I customize her.<br /><br />All around, she's fun and spunky looking-just not quite \\"purr-fect\\"
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Easy to install, simple to use. Gives a clear indication of battery status and projected life for the Kindle user. I highly recommend this product for all Kindle owners.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Spellbinding, even if ending was just a bit unrealistic--I suppose it's possible.  I guess I am not so forgiving, eh?
0920668372|5.0|This book makes me cry every time I read it! Every child needs to read it, great buy and the book arrived on time!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Such a sweet, earnest, heart-breaking story of people full of love and guilt.  So human.  Highly, highly recommend!  Real-life as it gets.
B009RX7IX8|4.0|Amazon lists this package as having 23 episodes.  There were 24 episodes broadcast.  Is the finale missing?  Big fan of the show.  I hope the set is complete.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|I loved Hosseini's The Kite Runner and didn't know how he could possibly top that brilliant, heart-wrenching story, BUT he did with A Thousand Splendid Suns! The beautiful relationships he created between the women are incredible and many layered. I had to stay up into the wee hours to finish this book. He captures the human spirit in a way that few authors can.
B007EC27QM|5.0|Works just like the electronic ones.  I like that you can see the series of calculations, very useful.  Good product worth the money. Thanks./
B00DC7N9NS|1.0|This movie was such a bomb.  It almost makes \\"The Wiz\\" look like a classic. I'm all for a prequel to \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" but this was bad from start to finish.
0142420891|5.0|If you have not read the first book If I stay, then you definitely should not read this book first! Love gayle forman and her work! Amazing book that arrived on time.
B0021L9ME6|3.0|Even a great and beautiful actress like Halle Berry cannot save this trainwreck of a movie script.<br />The casting is good, the images are nice, the music is good, but the story is just too weak.
B001NHNG64|3.0|I won't remember it a week from now, but it was a good way to pass a few vacation hours. What's with Child's attraction to sentence fragments?  That gets annoying after awhile.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I loved it! I could read 20 times and still not get it all! Defiant ly a book worth getting!
B006MHWXMS|2.0|I recently uninstalled this app after using it for about two months.  It just doesn't make the grade, in my opinion.  While visually attractive, the app has quirky features that make it hard to use, and it is buggy as well.<br /><br />As an example, the app comes with a widget (that incidentally cannot be resized to a small size) that displays the top items of your to-do list.  But if you update your to-do list using the app, the widget's list is not updated until you press a button on the widget!  No other app I've seen requires this, and it makes the widget that much less useful.  And, if you tap on the Android reminder notification from this app, and then use the resulting screen to change the due date and time of a task, the change is generally not carried back to even the main app until you press a button on the main app.  These are totally unnecessary steps, and it leaves you wondering what is going on even when you are a regular user.<br /><br />In addition, periodically, the app seems to create duplicate and triplicate entries for existing tasks.  It seems to work OK if you just delete the duplicates and triplicates, but it seems like a bad idea to me to trust the management of my to-do list to an app with these kinds of bugs.<br /><br />That, combined with totally ignoring any emails sent to the developer, convinced me to look for a different app that synchs with Google Tasks.
B004LWZW7Y|5.0|Loved this movie, of course I love stupid humor and cats, so what better combo is there?!? More of an adult movie than kid's movie, but funny.
B0071XO8RA|2.0|it's an interesting read  good characters.  however, there are huge gaping holes in the world Hugh has created.  the lack of elevators is only one of the smaller problems.  a contained world like the silo is like a generation ship.  Hugh doesn't deal with the resulting effects on individuals and society realistically.  if there really is a revolution on a predictable cycle why hasn't this society dealt with this reality?  the revolution comes together unrealistically fast.  that isn't how real revolutions happen.<br /><br />so I won't be watching for this author's work until he does his research.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|IT IS NOT WHAT YOU THINK AT ALL. IT KEEPS YOU GUESSING UNTIL THE VERY END. THE VILLIAN IS VERY EVIL.
B00B7Y0206|5.0|So far very good. A lot better than the one I had before. Kindler is getting goods app now and more useful
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This was fun and challenging enough to keep me playing...I wish there were more then 10 levels..they say there will be more in the future...
1932907009|5.0|As of right now, I'm starting chapter six in this book so I'll have to update this later when I do finish it.<br /><br />but.<br /><br />For the first 5 chapters, I kept a notepad next to me to mark down some notes and to start to flesh out a movie alongside it and as I was doing that, my eyes opened up to how most hollywood movies are written just like the book says! I used Blake Snyder's Beat Sheet to outline a story I was writing along side it and it became clear that this is a very good and very successful way that screenplays are written. I applied it to the short story I was writing along side it and it still worked, it still made the story keep going!<br /><br />The advice and tips that Blake Snyder writes in \\"Save the Cat\\" is more valuable that how much the book is sold at by a million.<br /><br />and so far from what I've read, it's totally worth it. I really recommend this book and once I finish it, I'll update my review.
B004HO6I4M|5.0|My daughter loves this movie and asks to watch it over and over.  Beautiful colors, good story, good soundtrack. Very enjoyable.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Reading this book for the second time, I am not skipping over the Waterloo section.  While it is interminably long, the writing is majestic and the compassion for human frailty is just as evident as throughout the remainder of the book -- the 'real' story.<br /><br />There is no doubt that Hugo writes a chapter (or 3!) when a paragraph would suffice, or a paragraph when a sentence would suffice.  But every one of them is a gem.<br /><br />This is truly a treasure of modern literature and should be required reading.
B00ECU2SGS|5.0|It is an adventure movie with a love story tucked in. A great feel-good movie. A MUST SEE MOVIE FOR ALL MCCOUNAHY FANS.
B00785P2QC|4.0|I like the simulated apps but this game can be a little tedious. The trucks are always breaking down you constantly are building factories and creating truck routes. Id rather be building more buildings for the Sim people and houses than daily and grain farms to make pies. Then you need to build the shoppiing mall just to sell the pies......like I said too tedious.
B008DBF5Z8|4.0|Really great. Almost as good as an Elmo.however, it doesn't work well with the lights out! You can use a lamp beside it and it will work just fine.
B004L0NGEC|5.0|Love. Picasa. ..it is so easy to use! Wish sharing with select groups was easier...i hate to have to make my albums Public, just so i can share. The other selection s for sharing do not seem to allow people i share with to open the albums. Please.....work on sharing privately.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|It is a great book both as a novel and as a mirror to the IIWW. The courage and horrible faiths of millions, stupidity  of others
B0084AZXKK|5.0|OK, I never read Treasure Island as a kid.  But I watched the Muppet Treasure Island with my kids :-)<br /><br />Finally reading this book I see why the Muppets were able to get such great material from it.  What a swashbuckling good read!
B00CA6WLAE|5.0|Such a bittersweet ending to an absolutely wonderful book. Thank you so very much, Mr. Colfer<br />P.S. mother goose is my favorite, I think
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Hugh tells a really good story. The characters are well developed. The plot takes interesting turns. The good guys can lose. The story shows a lot of the human spirit - things which make us exceptionally wonderful, and some of our darker nature as well. This goes on the list of books worth reading more than once, which for me is not a long list.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|ive cried and smiled with this amazing book.....best book of all time. Charlie is a really special guy and a very well created character.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|The author synthesized fragmented pieces of the history of ultramarathoning into an engaging story. It has inspired me to resurrect my running and modify my technique to allow for proper foot use.
B001V7R09A|4.0|Sviatoslav Richter (1915-1997) was indeed among the very finest pianists of the Twentieth Century.  What we have here is:<br /><br />\\"All 9 iconic Deutsche Grammophon LPs by Sviatslov Richter, \\"the last Titan\\" of the piano, together for the first time in one CD box -- presented in chronological order, as originally programmed, with original LP-cover artwork.\\"<br /><br />This is a Brilliant-style box with the discs in sturdy cardboard sleeves (no jewel cases) that replicate the original vinyl LPs.  Also included is a 34-page booklet with recording details and brief liner notes.<br /><br />*** *** ***<br /><br />Others more expert than I have pointed to superior Richter performances of some of the compositions elsewhere in the sprawling archipelago of live recordings.  But with the notable exceptions of Discs 8 and 9, these are state-of-the-art recordings.  We have a great introductory overview of one of the greatest 20th century pianists and a sampling of a range of classical composers from Haydn and Mozart through Debussy and Prokofiev.<br /><br />There seems to be virtual unanimity that the Disc 3 \\"Piano Concerto No. 2\\" by Rachmaninov is the best performance of the work, and one of Richter's finest hours.  Recorded in April 1959 in Warsaw, with Stanislaw Wislocki leading the Warsaw National Philharmonic Orchestra, it was released later that year.  Also included are Rachmaninov's \\"6 Preludes.\\"  The concerto has been widely available for years [[ASIN:B000001GQD paired with the Tchaikovsky concerto found here on Disc 6]].<br /><br />That Tchaikovsky \\"Piano Concerto No. 1,\\" with Herbert von Karajan leading the Wiener Philharmoniker, is Disc 6,  recorded in September 1962, and released by DG in 1963.  Richter always hated it, remembering Karajan fighting with him over the tempo.  It sounds great to me -- you'll have to decide for yourself.  (I look forward to hearing another Richter performance of the piece one of these days in [[ASIN:B004HGQXEK a Brilliant Concerto Edition box in the \\"Historical Russian Archives\\" series]]).<br /><br />Next to the Rachmaninov recording, this set's Disc 4, released in 1959, probably had the greatest impact.  Richter played a major role in popularizing Robert Schumann with this October 1958 recording of the \\"Piano Concerto in A minor op. 54\\" and April 1959 recording of the \\"Introduction and Allegro appassionato in G major op. 92\\" with Witold Rowicki leading the Warsaw National Philharmonic Orchestra.  Also on the disc are two pieces for solo piano. According to the liner notes, \\"50 years after its release, it remains one of the most compelling and entrancing Schumann discs ever made... ...one of the most sheerly joyful records in the catalogue.\\"  Disc 1 is all solo Schumann -- mono recordings from November 1956 released in 1957 -- and apparently it does not enjoy the same reputation.<br /><br />One of my favorite discs of piano music is Richter's Prokofiev: [[ASIN:B000001GXD Richter's Prokofiev (Piano Concerto No. 5/Piano Sonata No. 8)]].  On the original DG LPs, these two recordings were on different discs.  The great concerto is on Disc 2 along with Mozart's \\"Piano Concerto No. 20 in D minor\\" K466, both performed by Rowicki and the WNPO.  Dedicated Mozarteans tend not to see Richter as being truly in tune with Mozart's light and playful music, but many make an exception for this performance.  When it comes to the Prokofiev, there is widespread agreement that this is the best performance.  Many of us also believe that No. 5, not the more popular No. 3, is Prokofiev's best piano concerto.<br /><br />Prokofiev's \\"Piano Sonata No. 8 in B flat major op. 84\\" is one of his masterpieces, along with No. 7, and Richter's is the best performance.  It concludes the solo piano recital Disc 5 here, following works by Haydn, Chopin, and Debussy, recordings from 1961 that were released in 1962.<br /><br />Disc 7 presents Beethoven's \\"Piano Concerto No. 3,\\" with Kurt Sanderling leading the Wiener Symphoniker, recorded in September 1962, and released in 1963.  Richter also performs the \\"Rondo for Piano and Orchestra in B flat major, a charming but minor and rarely played fragment.  I don't know of anyone who claims this is the best recording of the Beethoven concerto, but it sounds great.<br /><br />Finally we come to Discs 8 and 9 and my reservation concerning this collection.  Richter was an artist who loved to play live, and expressed dissatisfaction with studio recordings.  These discs, originally released in 1963 and 1965, were recorded live on Richter's Italian tour (Rome-Palermo-Venice) of November 1962.

0345457684|3.0|I'd like to start out by saying that this was a fun novel, I could see it making a great movie adaptation or graphic novel.  That said, I feel the book was too conventional in some respects and underdeveloped in others.<br />The story and characters are conventional hardboiled, noire detective fare.  It makes for trite, one dimensional characters, predictable plot swerves and at times cheesy dialogue.  The rich old murder victim, the younger seductress wife, the hard-edged detective at odds with and being manipulated by different factions, the hooker with the heart of gold...most of the characters are little more than these tired, noire archetypes, going through the motions.<br />What differentiates this from the typical hardboiled detective mystery is the cyberpunky setting.  While it has some interesting additions, too often the sci-fi aspects are underdeveloped, superficial and just seem like a gimmick slapped over a formulaic detective story.  The concept of sleeving presents a lot of interesting existential and ethical questions, and occasionally they are brought up, but hardly ever in much depth, and only as filler in between moving the plot along.  The world is intriguing, but never fleshed out.  We know Kovacs is an Envoy from offworld, but these are more just phrases tossed around, without much explanation or detail.<br />Characterizations are pretty weak, especially the protagonist.  Kovacs never had much of an identity to me beyond that of a badass '80s action movie star, all one-liners and tough guy shtick.<br />Again, it was a fun read, but light on the sci-fi aspects.  As cyberpunk goes, it's pretty light-weight compared to Stephenson or Gibson.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is one of the best series I have ever watched on any channel. The characters are unforgettable and the setting is superb. I have watched season 3 twice. Can't wait for season 4! Bravo BBC!!!!!!
B00498YZH8|5.0|over and over, but excellent acting.  Too realistic for my taste, like to laugh in a movie. This one made me want to throw up.  I'm sure it was going for that affect when you do a movie like this.  Hat's off to Jennifer Lawrence.  Her and her cast really made this real.  Ugh!!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|After you've completed missions the game gets faster, and more challenging. I love challenging my friends, also the way ur game is saved to the cloud is wonderful just In case you ever need to download it again
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|As I read this book, I kept imagining the nuns who taught me in parochial school reaching for their angelic rulers with which to rap me on the head. Aslan presents a well-documented look at the life and times of Jesus of Nazareth, as well as the early church after his death and resurrection. Traditionalists and anyone in the Vatican will probably dislike this book. My devout Roman Catholic brother would not even consider reading it. But if you believe - as I do - that faith is a gift of grace, then read this book secure in the knowledge that it does not diminish the appeal of the Nazarene but rather strengthens the idea that he was God made man. A real man, living in the world of his day, not above it.

B00D6BQPMM|5.0|My co workers talked about this movie and I wanted to see it just from the previews. I'm not a zombie person at all! I can't stand the walking dead or anything else that has zombies. I close my eyes and hate it. Even the boneys in the movie were okay with me and the visual parts were nicely done. It was a time old tale of course but the spin was nice. Very light hearted and entertaining.

0345529057|4.0|One thing make me sad. The books don't a hardcover. Cover quickly loses and gets a decent look shabby. And the book is very good. Very strong fantasy, dark and harsh. Not predict which of the characters will die on the next page.

B00CF34B2I|1.0|Aside from having the Magic name attached to it, There is pretty much no difference from any other trading card app out there. Also, This is a demo with 5 tutorial battles, If you want the full version you have to pay an incredibly overpriced 10 dollars. Even then they still hit you with in-game purchases. Talk about a rip off, At the most this game should be 2 dollars.

B00CPLGGWS|5.0|These AMD APUs are great buys for budget desktop computers. A8-6600K in particular is even capable of running new games at low-medium settings. The integrated GPU is not as good as a separate card but much much better than motherboard-integrated graphics. Getting decent graphics plus a quad core processor for just $120 is an incredible deal. FM2 motherboards are also very affordable. I built a complete PC (no monitor) for $350 using this APU, 1TB HDD and 8GB RAM. Not bad at all.<br /><br />I happen to have a new blog. I wrote an article about a $350 build using this processor: codeitdown.com/350-quad-core-desktop-with-amd-a8-6600k/
B00AC8ZIXO|5.0|It's been years since I played HALO. Ever since went to ps3.This movie brought all the great battles back into my mind. From capture the flag to the alien weapons. I knew someone built a warthog great to see it in action. As for the movie itself was expecting something campy and stupid like Starship Troopers so was really delighted and surprised by how good a movie it actually was.

B00DGNO3WE|3.0|Maggie Smith ,Billy Connolly , Dustin Hoffman always have my attention. I have been waiting for this film forever . I don't know why. the characters were one dimensional, somewhat stereotypical .If I had to choose the best from the lot, it would be Billy Connolly although his character had no more depth than the others, there is something about his ability to make you forget that it is him onscreen .If you love opera, I mean really love opera. this might interest you, there are some bona fide singers and musicians in the film . if you don't I would pass
B0064X7FVE|3.0|Not ready for prime time.  Lots of crashes, lots of weird errors (for instance, pouring rain, flood warnings and the tag line says &quot;thunderstorms.  Dry conditions will continue.&quot;  Yeah not so much.)<br /><br />Needs more testing and less useless flash.

B0058VW36U|1.0|I was enjoying playing this clever little game. However, the day I downloaded it, I noticed the time was not advancing on my Kindle. I was unable to enter text to search the web or send an e-mail. When playing songs in my playlists, they would suddenly stop and start over from the beginning. Tried several things with no success. Then I began to wonder if it might be the newly downloaded app. Removed it, and everything is once again working fine. Too bad! The game itself is quite clever and fun.

B0036EH40Q|5.0|Good movie.  Its the preferred version in Tombstone as I recently discovered.  Matches up well to what you see on a visit.
B00A81NFAS|5.0|That just don't make films like this anymore. I would strongly suggest the planet should watch this film. Its a Dark humor but the kind of humor thats actually funny and not over the top. Everyone in this film is dysfunctional and don't even realize it. I love films like this when they are NOT trying to be funny but just generally messed up people. The movie hits on alot of stereotypes of people and how they relate. Tiffany was the type of woman that I have always wished for . She was sexy without trying Dark, Tough, Straight forward, and Sensual. The thing I loved the most about her character is you could tell the love she had for Pat was special. She didn't show that side to everyone and it was very obvious. She was a hard girl but a vunerable kitten to Patrick. Thats when you know a person really loves you and only you. When you see a certain side of a person and noone else gets that same pleasure.<br /><br /> Pats wife was the stereotypical Prissy type along with Tiffany's sister (Julia Stiles). Jennifer Lawrence deserves everything she recieved for her performance. She was very convincing through out the entire film. You could see her love and pain through out the film. I really felt sorry for her because Pat was so cruel at times even just right out mean and judgmental. But for what ever reason she still wanted him and didn't give up. The thing that enamored me the most is that he didn't have anything to offer. But yet instill she loved him unconditionaly and still wanted to be apart of his life. The Dinner, Jogging scenes and at the Cafe are absolutley classic and unforgettable. This is a film that will stand the test of time for many years to come or even generations. You only get one of these types of films like every 7 to 10 years. The last time I felt this intrigued by a film was when Matchpoint (2005) and Closer (2004) came out. U just don't get many realistic straight forward films in Hollywood anymore. There is alot of great dialogue in this film thatis unforgettable.<br /><br />Although Closer and Matchpoint are two totally different types of films. They are still just as unique and intoxicating as Silver Linings. Robert Deniro did his part as usual and his character was quirky as well. In the end the movie shows how people can be judged and what society deems as a normal person or trophy wife. Bradley Cooper's Character was somewhat judmental and very closed minded . He felt by society standards his ex cheating wife was the perfect woman. But in the end he realized what he needed and what was best for him. Which I am certainly glad he figured it out before it was too late. I can say with out doubt it would have haunted him for the rest his life. I know, I still till this day wish I knew this girl that I was friends with. She was beautiful hard, tattooed and VERY unique . But because at the time I wanted the take home to mom type. I didn't give her a chance and It haunts me everyday. Years later I have never met anyone that came close to her. With out spoiling the film just watch it you won't be disappointed.

B0093LFXIG|4.0|What an eye opener! I couldn't believe my eyes at some of the things I was reading about these four lads! It was like reading a story about your best friend and then learning all of this dark stuff that they never told you about! But to see the truth behind the smiles, I've grown even more inspired by this band! Which I didn't think could happen. Well done lads, well done.<br /><br />4 stars because the book does get a bit repetitive, but otherwise, it's like listening to a someone tell you a story.

1417628596|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo33DJGB1E1D6NU]](Review by Dean Goranites of the BookReviewersClub.)<br /><br />The book is about a research program involving a drug test.  A company was looking for volunteers to participate in a drug study, and Huxley volunteered to join the program.<br /><br />Basically, the story takes place within an 8 to 10 hour time period after Huxley consumes the drug \\"Mescaline.\\"  He then recorded the entire experience so that when he wrote this essay, he could give exact quotes of how he had felt while on the under the influence.<br /><br />In the book, Huxley said he was not really concerned about space, which Dean found really interesting. He also liked the various details about life that Huxley discussed.  Aside from that, Huxley was very focused on natural occurrences.<br /><br />The whole book was really intriguing, and so Dean gave the book 5 stars.

B00C2IPB66|5.0|Gladiator was a 5+ star movie when it debuted in the theater in 2000, and whether you watch it in VHS, DVD or any format it remains a 5+ star movie. Now released in Blu Ray / Steelbook and surprise, surprise ;-)it is still a 5+ star movie.  What did you expect?  It's Gladiator... and the format it is released will never change the fact it is a 5+ star movie and one of the best movies all time, in this reviewer's humble opinion. I would enjoy Gladiator on a 5\\" screen in 4x3 format, heck, I would even watch it on one of those old Viewmaster slide flipper thing-a-ma-jigs from the 70's!!  This movie is a classic, period. There is no other way to put it...<br /><br />So now, with Gladiator packaged in Steelbook and Blu Ray, and with 17 minutes of new footage in addition to the Theatrical version, could we even make a case that it is better than ever?  Maybe now 5++ stars?<br /><br />Forget about the fact it is probably one of the most historically accurate movies Hollywood has ever produced.  Then forget about how Russell Crowe turned in the performance of his career - probably the performance of anyone's career.  And let's not forget that this movie was so good, that even Joaquin Phoenix turned in a good performance!  The movie would stand on it's own without any of that - the plot and story itself was well laid out and well executed - and that alone make it a great movie.<br /><br />The Blu Ray transfer quality of the movie was good.  There were a couple of scenes that did not transfer well, for instance the initial scene on the battlefield - some of the shots came out dark and not as clear as I would have hoped. But other than that, the movie looked great in Blu Ray - and definitely an improvement over my DVD copy overall.<br /><br />Bottom line - we are talking about Gladiator here.  In Blu Ray.  With 17 minutes of bonus.  And in Steelbook to boot.  One of the best movies ever made.  Amazon should only offer a five star choice for rating this movie - the 4, 3, 2, and 1 star choices should be grayed out and not selectable!<br /><br />Thanks for reading.1 star choices should be grayed out and not selectable!<br /><br />Thanks for reading.
B008RJ6TTC|4.0|The Columbo character became for me an educational tour deforce on the complexities and flaws of humans. I sometimes got the feeling that Mr. Falk was not acting in the normal sense of that word, but was expressing the wonder and surprizes that humans display in stressful and or unusual situations.
B00AGE5P0U|4.0|I have watched this movie in the past and watched it again and found it just as interesting as before.  It has good acting and good plot.
B000SEIK2S|4.0|I although I think it's probably fairer and more accurate to give this book 3.5 stars, I decided to round up to 4.  It is a very innovative and imaginative book.  It definitely has the power to lift the reader out of the daily grind and into this interesting other world (or other worlds, really).<br /><br />It's definitely entertaining and will make a great movie someday (soon, hopefully).
B00081912E|4.0|It's a good movie. Very different.  I saw it when it first came out. It's a classic if you like Jim Carrey.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|Yay! Soooo happy with how this one ended... does anyone else have \\"The Eye of the Tiger\\" playing in their head like I do? Bring on the fight! LOL. Okay, so this book, gosh how to even describe it. It was so back and forth for me, just when I thought I knew who I wanted America to pick something else would happen and I'd change my mind... darn you Aspen and Maxon for both being perfect in your own ways even when they are being jerks! I must say though I'm glad she chose the way she did (or seems to have anyway). I could see how some would be annoyed with the indecision, but I loved it, this is no small decision for her or her country. Another good read that I devoured in one day.

B006SV2LWA|3.0|The book (Robin Cook) is better than the movie.  It did not flow as well as it could have.  The acting was good, but the directing and flow of movie was not that great.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|I think - if Amazon allowed half stars I'd give this book 3.5 stars.  This was a gripping read.  Once I picked it up I couldn't put it down.  Countless times I nearly missed my train stop or found myself dreaming of zombie invasions because I'd fallen asleep at 3am while reading the book.  It's really imaginative and so scary but in this irresistible way where you're shaking in your boots as you read but you want to know more, want to hear what happens next.<br /><br />I should confess that I read this book AFTER having seen the movie.  But was pleased to find that the two are completely different.  If anything the movie helped me visualize some of the things described in the book.<br /><br />Definitely an enjoyable read - even though it does drag on a bit at the end.

B00471TLZS|5.0|i bought this movie for my daughter's 12th birthday party. she wanted scary, i wanted reasonable. this fit the bill perfectly. even with the 80's cheesy special effects, the girls screamed and hid their eyes, and my husband and i enjoyed it again as well.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Finally got a chance to see this movie last night and although feeling a bit lazy decided to refer to the wonderful review by katybrit, in her well written opening paragraph. Quote: \\"This is why we go to movies. Silver Linings Playbook is that rare breed of movie where all the moving parts got put together in exactly the right way. The dialogue is sharp, witty, insightful, funny, and often brutally honest. It respects and holds true affection for its characters and the wonderful ensemble cast makes it look easy. The direction, editing and soundtrack are spot on. It is a future classic and the best movie of the year.\\"- I would add that this is a movie maker's movie, a brilliant production from top down and bottom up with powerful riveting performances by the lovely and bit scary Jennifer Lawrence, talented Bradley Cooper, Robert DiNero and Jacki Weaver along with the rest of the cast. The director David O Russell has done a great job translating this book into film; I'm always amazed at people with such talent. I use the word scary to describe the young, attractive Ms.Lawrence as this is the second time I've been impressed by her powerful performance as an actress the first being her superb role in \\"Winters Bone\\". Mr. Cooper should be commended for being up to the task of matching the performance of such a talented actress. This is in my opinion is one of the best dramatic films to come along in many years and was an absolutely delightful and entertaining experience, don't miss it.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|So a great job of keeping g us on the edge. Once I started to read the book I did not put it down till the end. Then to find out there was more. It was like what. I want to read the next part not wait. Just like great story.A must read.maybe better than 50shades of grey.

At first I was worried (nay PISSED) when I read the early synopsis of this movie. I LOVED the original, it's premise was novel, effectively handled, and above all scary. The changes sounded stupid, pointless, and I wrote the movie off when it came to theaters.<br /><br />Then I watched it, and was pleasantly surprised. One of the few times I was glad to be wrong.

B00EV4F5TC|1.0|This pathetic cast of characters makes a mockery of the people they pretend to be. I haven't seen as bad of a movie as \\"The Butler\\" since Gigli with Jaylo and Afflec... You would be better off watching \\"I Am Sam\\" twice (Because that is about the same time it takes to watch this painful production) than watching this even once.

B00DR0PDNE|2.0|My Chromecast device arrived today.  I had it plugged into my LG i(SmartTV) in minute and TV configured for my WiFi network.  From then on it was downhill.  The required Chromecast app I downloaded per instructions on my TV screen did not work on an old XP laptop.  Well, maybe that was to be expected.  Then, the app would not work on a new Windows 8, Dell laptop either.  I tried about a million settings just to be sure it was not my settings.  The Chromecast app started fine but never completed a necessary search for compatible things to run -- it just searched endlessly.  It is suppose to run from Google Chrome browser, but the extension (add-on) did not show any indication of working within Chrome.  Next, I put the Chromcast app on my iPad, and it worked -- but only with Netflix.  My TV came with Netflix.  I tried to &#34;throw&#34; Youtube on the TV, but that application said I needed updates of some sort. In spite of all this, the concept seems solid enough if it worked. It does not, as far as I can tell, with the one exception -- Netflix. If you only have a Smartphone and have no other way to see larger images, maybe this will work for you.  Disappointing that Google didn't or couldn't do better with this. I think 2-stars is generous.
B00BMKDTNC|4.0|The last three books were riveting. I found the names and places overwhelming, but the plot too engrossing to give up. And got used to the peculiarity of the wheel of time.<br /><br />The character development was sophisticated. The main antagonists had their individual reasons for turning to the dark lord. I could almost imagine my version of a back story about how the dark lord came to be in the age of legends. The dark one was a force of nature which channelers misused while thinking themselves ruled over. Kind of like a Greek comedy/tragedy. Two full ages/cycles of pain and suffering to mop up the toxic spills from a drilling, or bore, gone bad.<br /><br />It tickled me to detect a hint of an allegory of oil spills. A source of incredible power for those who could harness it. A source of agony for those caught up in an accidental release.
0374530718|2.0|I've had this book on my shelf for years, but had never gotten around to reading it.  I've always felt I should know more about philosophy than I do, so tend to have an eye out for books that make that topic accessible.  Having read Nigel Warburton's \\"A Little History of Philosophy\\", and enjoying it very much, earlier this summer, I thought, \\"I should finally read \\"Sophie's World\\"!  After having read so many favorable reviews, I found it to be a colossal disappointment.  At several points along the way I considered abandoning my attempt to finish it, but stuck with it thinking--hoping?, praying?!--there might yet be a payoff of some sort.  It never came.  I fully agree with the many readers who note that the book is really a textbook masquerading as a novel.  Many passages feel as though they were cut and pasted from a middling academic tome.  The characters are one-dimensional, the supposed suspense/mystery non-existent, and the dialogue wincingly bad.  I've given it two stars rather then one because I did come away with a couple of kernels of understanding about particular philosophers.  If you, as I was, are looking for an accessible introduction to philosophy, I'd point you away from \\"Sophie's World\\" and in the direction of the aforementioned Warburton offering.
0374214913|2.0|After downloading the sample and thoroughly enjoying the beginning, PENUMBRA slowly goes Pffff, like a balloon that has just been popped.  The characters start out cool and hip and of interest and glide into dullness.  It reads like a movie treatment, not a novel.  Just read the sample.
B00ECU2RGY|4.0|it is nice and i used it and i put it to use after I used and its a lot of words 15 lame
B000H305U0|5.0|This is a perfect album, there's not a single song on it that I do not care for. It's 7 years old (holy crap does time fly) and it still sounds as fresh as it did the day that I first listened to it.
B00377E5SG|5.0|I've watched this movie a dozen times and have never gotten tired of it. The characters are so well cast. Julia Ormond makes the perfect Sabrina.
B00CATSONE|4.0|Amazingly written, enjoyed it thoroughly and have a new found respect for Nikola Tesla. Looking forward to reading Sean Patrick's next book.
B00ECUARO8|1.0|This movie was a total waste - 2 hours of my life that I can't get back.  The acting was adequate but the story was non existent!
B006H5120E|5.0|This 3D version was so awesome...the additional footage was great to see....The 3D was so incredible to watch. I loved it even more this time. James Cameron is the best and Titanic 3D is a must see for sure!<br />jayman57

B001AZFO14|5.0|Kurt Russell kicks so much ass in this movie its unbelievable.  A+ cheesy action flick.  The best part is when he says.  \\"I'm gonna kill em all sir!\\"  Most lines he has in the whole movie right there!
B002BCNK1Q|5.0|Amazon kept locking it up and restarting the movie, so we finally gave up and watched something else. This happens about 80% of the time we try to rent a movie on Amazon.
B0017SWPXY|3.0|The book was a quick read and was decent for a car ride or the beach.  It´s told from a dog´s perspective so the writing very straightforward and simplistic.  It´s also worth mentioning that it is a bit melodramatic and sad and could be a Lifetime original movie.  Is it a great?  In my opinion no.  Is it better than playing candy crush on your mobile phone, yes.  If you have a couple of hours to spare, it´s decent.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I loved this book so much. I love the fact that it is realistic but it has parts that you wouldn't expect. I hope everyone else enjoys it.
B004TJ1H3C|5.0|I hate, hate, hate the fact that this show was cancelled. In my opinion, Atlantis would have been better if it had been more like Universe. SGU had so much going for it and could've gone so much further. The second season started to explore some really great storylines that I really wanted to see carried through.<br /><br />The extras are pretty cool. Lots of neat interviews and behind the scenes stuff. No Kino Diaries this season though, unfortunately.

B008C20TDG|4.0|I bought this book hoping to get some more information on the Paleo Movement Information and Scientific/Trial Proof. I have read about this topic EXTENSIVELY and was kind of disappointed with the content. For a beginner who hasn't ever heard of the nutrition revolution of the paleo movement, it is still a good book to pick up so that they can dip their toes into the water a bit. As a person who has had some good background on the subject through researching, I feel it can be a bit restrictive. For example, they say you should probably cut out grains, dairy, sugar, alcohol, and all of the sub contents that fall under these mentioned foods. I have no problem with cutting out grains and sugar because I have noticed that they do create A LOT of problems in my body. But, I honestly cannot give up dairy. And for the time that I have been on a health streak, dairy has helped me become healthier. I'm not talking about milk or cheese. I mostly consume yogurt that has probiotics and lots of protein (also lack of lactose).<br /><br />Although they do not go into the specifics as much as I would like, it's still a good starter book. For me personally, I need ALL of the information so that I can connect the dots much better with other research I have done to confirm whats best for me in terms of nutrition.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|I only learned about this app recently, but it is AWESOME! I've always loved the card game, and seeing a cool little animation for each move gives the game even more life. The cutscenes throughout the game keep me interested in the lore. The only thing I could possibly ask for would be Yawgmoth XD
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I really enjoy this app can find verses with just a few key words so far I've not had any problems with it.
B0089EHWQE|4.0|This is light reading, but not light hearted.  Really enjoyed the story line, and felt that it<br />stayed on track, while enough happened that you were carried along, and surprised by it.
B000V5Y1SQ|5.0|When Deep Space Nine first came out I was impress with the show. The concept was new for Star Trek instead of roaming space in a starship it was based on a space station which I believe make it a successful show. The shows were well written for the most part that is. You have a few that were just too unbelievable but all in all it is a great show and it enhances the Star Trek series. I recommend every Star Trek to fan to watch
B00AFQC4QC|5.0|This book starts in a deceptively simple way. A young girl Greta, the daughter of a Jewish weaver, steps into a Bratislava bookshop to indulge in her love and passion for  reading. There, she meets  Wilhelm, a young German bookseller. The two feel an immediate connection to each other through their love for books, a connection that blossoms into romance, love, and later, marriage.  As a romance, this book is superb: well-drawn, believable, with authentic and likable characters, each with their own realistic flaws.<br /><br />But calling this amazing novel a romance would be a major understatement. What immediately complicates the budding relationship between Greta and Wilhelm is the historical setting that at first acts as a backdrop for their relationship but, as the story develops, gradually comes to the fore and becomes a guiding force in the story, just like it happened in Europe in 1933 as the dramatic events of World War Two unfolded.<br /><br />Of course, many countries in Europe were involved in and affected by the war, but Czechoslovakia in 1933, the main setting of this novel, was  unique in that it was the only functioning European democracy at the time.  That status did not last too long, though, and by 1938 (which is chapter three of this novel), it started losing its regions to Germany. Soon, it was completely taken over by Germany.  The historical detail, the meticulous research done by the author (just look at the topnotch bibliography at the end, and you will be amazed), the accuracy of the smallest detail in the narration - all make this story come to life in the most realistic way possible.<br /><br />But don't think that research means absence of plot or dry writing style. Far from it. As the story and the raging war in Europe progress, Greta and Wilhelm get deeper and deeper involved both in their own relationship, full of challenges and complications, from settling on common religious beliefs to dealing with a miscarriage to attempts to find a safe place for their young family to eventual separation, and in events surrounding them. And that's just the beginning.<br /><br />This beautifully told story is filled with allegories and symbolism. For example, at one point, Greta and Wilhelm are considering getting forged passports from a communist and a former customer of Wilhelm's bookshop. A passing phrase, \\"we know a lot about people by the kind of books they buy\\" immediately made me think of the power of books, a theme that runs strongly throughout this novel, and Hitler's multiple agencies that diligently worked at blacklisting, banning, and eliminating anything that could be construed as \\"un-German.\\" Banning books and limiting information access - a terrifying but still very much present concept in today's world.<br /><br />The author's portrayal of Greta as a \\"pawn in a political chess game\\" as she is trying to fit in but failing, feels very real. In Greta's case, with her Jewish background but lack of Jewish religion, a blond son, and a German husband, she just doesn't belong with either Jews or Germans.  Nowhere seems safe for her in war-ravaged Europe.  Greta's plight feels so real, I couldn't help but wonder if it's the author's own \\"ambiguous sense of belonging\\" in Bavaria  (he was born in Germany from a mixed heritage marriage) shaped his understanding and emotional connection to Greta.<br /><br />An amazing book on many levels. Highly recommended.safe place for their young family to eventual separation, and in events surrounding them.

B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|A very informative, well documented and researched monograph..The discussion in the bibliography is splendid. The tome documents the emergence of the Paulist Controversy....whether Christ was the creation of the literature, secured at Nicea, or the real historical character of Jewish history. The author does solid work explaining the historical Roman vs. Jewish nationalism, or neo-Solomanism...dreamed zeal. Well done!
1250029465|5.0|I loved this book. A small show of kindness turned into a life changing experience for both. Animals are incredibly intuitive to the needs of their humans. Orange or ginger cats seem to super intelligent and Bob surpass all!
B000L53D4O|4.0|I was deciding between V-tech walker and this one and decided on this as I did't want to have to replace batteries all the time and listen to the noises.  As some reviews say, this walker could have been heavier and sturdier.  My 1 year old enjoys to push this walker around even without noises.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Fun to play for many ages,  elementary school thru adult, and it's FREE!  Highly recommend this game.<br /><br />* Just make sure you BLOCK in-app charges if you're handing your device over to kids to play this game.  This game does have the ability to purchase extra hints and maybe levels or something (haven't played that long yet!), but these purchases are totally OPTIONAL and NOT needed to have lots of fun with this game! *<br /><br />My son had some difficulty getting into this game, but I made him read the instructions and now he loves it.
0316228583|1.0|I did not read this book.  I purchased it for my granddaughter, age 15.  I know that it was<br />labeled as an &#34;adult&#34; book, but with just a brief perusal of this book I concluded that it was<br />absolutely not a book I would buy for my granddaughter and in fact not for me.  When she<br />was so popular as a children's writer it is a shame for her change her image.

B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I like this series of books.  Its nice to see something that isn't just about vampires.  Maybe the next movie they make will be more like the books so I can enjoy them too.  If you like the first book you will like this one also.
