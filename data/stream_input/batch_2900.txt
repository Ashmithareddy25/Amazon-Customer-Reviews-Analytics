0553386794|5.0|I had actually never heard of these books before I saw the show, and I'm an avid sci-fi and fantasy reader. It was actually VERY difficult for me to start reading these books. I've read plenty of books and then seen the movie/show, but I've never read a book AFTER seeing the show or movie. I'm halfway through the second book now and they really are just THAT good. If you're on the fence, here are some reasons to push you over.<br /><br />Deleted/Altered Scenes<br />This is probably the biggest reason for most of you, and started off as mine as well. FAIR WARNING! The first few chapters, and a lot of the first book, is verbatim in the show. They really did an excellent job transferring this over to the screen. The first chapters were very discouraging to me at first to keep going. But keep reading! There are plenty of scenes that play out differently than you expect, or have little details put in that really draw you in, or are never in the show in the first place. I literally spent weeks trying to motivate myself through the first chapters, then devoured the rest of the book in a few days because of this. If you're still finding the first book particularly difficult to get through: the second book has so much more information, scenes, and dialog not in the show that it's constantly surprising me.<br /><br />Character Motivations<br />While you have to draw from the looks on the actor's faces to figure out what their characters are thinking in the show, the book gives you very detailed looks into the character's heads, as books are wont to do. Learning the motivations behind some actions that seem odd or baffling in the show is very enlightening. These characters are very real and organic; if there's something they did in the show that seemed out of character, it makes a lot more sense after reading the book. Are you scratching your head over Ned's actions in King's Landing? I was, but this brought everything together.<br /><br />The War<br />The lack of detail in the show about the war always bugged me a little, but holy crap. After reading 1.5 of the books, all the information I was missing out on is staggering. I never really understood why some of the battles were such a big deal, or why they had to attack certain places or groups, or who had the biggest army and etc. Knowing all this lends a LOT more weight to the character's motivations, to scenes involving discussing the war (both in the book and the show), and of course to the battles. You actually get what's on the line during all this and it really helps make things more enjoyable. Here are some quick examples.<br />(Very minor spoiler alert. And this review is for if you've seen the show so you shouldn't worry anyways!)<br />Example 1: Why does Viserys marry Daenerys to Drogo? He needs an army. How big do you think his Khal is? 10,000, 20,000-strong? Try more like 60,000-80,000. Wow. I would've married her off too.<br />(Bigger spoiler alert, but again, if you've seen the first season of the show you're fine)<br />Example 2: Remember when Rob captured Jaime? That was a big deal, TOO big a deal it seemed to me when I watched the show. Well apparently they then proceeded to completely own the 12,000-strong Lannister forces around riverrun while only losing 1000-1200 men. Well, balls, no wonder everyone was making a big deal out of this.<br /><br />Writing Style<br />George R. R. Martin is just plain enjoyable to read. And this is from somebody that was at first reluctant to start the books.<br /><br />Bottom Line<br />If you love the show, you want more, you're curious, somewhat patient, and have the time to read a longer book: You should definitely start reading the books.<br />If you love the show, you want more, you're somewhat curious, not too patient, and/or don't have much time on your hands: Try borrowing a friend's copy first. If you're not into it 15 chapters in, you're probably not going to be. (Except the second book has a TON more not in the show!)<br />Ifyou like the show, want more, you're somewhat curious, but you have no patience and no time: There are a lot of youtube channels and videos that have pretty enjoyable discussions you can watch.<br /><br />Hope this helps. It really is worth the read.you like the show, want more, you're somewhat curious, but you have no patience and no time: There are a lot of youtube channels and videos that have pretty enjoyable discussions you can watch.<br /><br />Hope this helps. It really is worth the read.
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|I Read it in one night. Couldn't put it down! It was beautiful and tragic. I miss the characters already.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Writing is witty and funny.  Acting jobs by all are very good.  Intriguing plot lines and some good antaganists.  Keep up the good work!
0439023521|3.0|This book was pretty disappointing, especially after all the hype.  The ending was better than I thought that it would be.
B000JCQCW4|1.0|i never received my movie, I tried several different ways to look up my package and couldn't. i am very un pleased  with my service through amazon because of this. Now I don't feel comfortable to spend money with amazon for fear I wont receive my product and still be billed. I have not made any further purchases because of this situation and have further gone to advertise this situation to those i know
B000002MP2|5.0|I have liked this cd ever since it came out.  I had forgotten how much I like to sing along.  I think that &#34;Dookie&#34; is Green Day's best.
B002WY65W4|4.0|Double tap, that's my motto. THis is a funny movie, not as bloody as you would expect. And the surprise cameo appearance is wonderful.
B009KHDT0C|4.0|Amazon is great with the streaming capabilities and choices.  I liked this movie, though it was a little more campy than I thought it would be.  I enjoyed it.  Tim Burton is awesome.
B002ZG981E|4.0|You have to focus when watching this movie, but the premises and ideas in this movie are wonderful. I love movies that are out of the mainstream.
B000002LQR|5.0|This is one of my favorite Chlili Peppers cd's.  It is packed with good music and how can you go wrong with &#34;Under the Bridge?&#34;
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I realize there are also a lot of men who want to be made into submissives out there, but why are we so fascinated with women being demeaned, controlled, and subjugated in our society?<br /><br />I also thought the book was totally unrealistic - sort of a modern-day 'mild porno' romance novel....I only read the first book and wasn't interested in reading the other two...
B0052UYJDC|5.0|Reminded me of the movie Up In the Air, “Ryan Bingham: How much does your life weigh? Imagine for a second that you're carrying a backpack. I want you to pack it with all the stuff that you have in your life...”<br />The book is about having an easier and more fulfilling life and minimalism is the one of the tools for it.
B000HZEPAE|5.0|You have to like the kind of humor South Park represents, but if you do, this is a great movie. It successfully parodies everything in the action movie genre, makes pointed-but-not-overt social commentary, has some of the best one-liners you could ask for, and does it all with marionettes in lavishly constructed sets that have numerous hilarious touches as well. I first saw it when it came out, and own a copy on DVD, but we were out of town and wanted to share it with some friends so we bought this copy.<br /><br />It is worthy of multiple views and has even managed to stay relevant although it's 10 years old.<br /><br />And finally, the sex scene is not to be missed. Worth the price of admission by itself.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|I love this move! It has become one of my favorite movies to quote with friends. I would definitely recommend it.

RIDDICK is a combination and culmination of so many things. The duality of the various layers is totally captivating. It had my attention throughout. What else are summers for? Movie going? Yes.<br /><br />I love the story. The hero is left for dead on a barren planet. He has been betrayed and he must now contend with alien predators out to get him. Yet, help is coming or is it something else? When they land all damnation breaks loose.

I really do love it when a plan comes together!

0385349947|5.0|To be frank, I wasn't all that excited about reading this book. One of the members of my book group selected it after having seen the author's TED Talk and being intrigued. I went along with it since one of the purposes of the group is for us to be prompted to read things outside material we usually gravitate toward. I was afraid this was going to be a bit of a navel-gazing whine and ended up having my socks knocked off.<br /><br />A bit of background about me --- I was hired into a Fortune 500 company straight out of college and was working my way up the corporate management ladder. After 10 years of work, I had a baby and decided to stay home for the first three years of her life. I then returned to the same company but in a part-time, individual contributor role. That didn't work out all that well and I decided to return to my home as a full-time mom. The other women in the group include 1) a recently retired career woman who is married but with no children 2) A PhD scientist who is recently divorced with two children and 3) a career woman, married with one child, who is the primary bread winner in the home. I want to share this with you so you will better understand the comment that we all had something positive to say about the book and had quite the lively discussion over dinner.<br /><br />On a person note, I saw myself and many of the decisions made in the pages of this book. I did get off the career path when I felt like I wasn't doing anything well and the author could have been inside my head as I made that decision. The other women who had made the decision to stay in the workforce (women of diverse home situations) were nodding a LOT as we talked about some of the challenges faced every day to compete on equal footing with the men.<br /><br />This is a fabulous book that women of all ages should read (particularly those early in their careers). I am also encouraging my husband to read it so he will be a better manager/communicator/mentor to the women he works with. There is no navel-gazing or pity-party here, just one woman's experience and honest communication of what she sees as barriers for woman moving into senior management. Some of the barriers are external (society/culture) and some are internal where women are their own worst enemies.<br /><br />Must read for anyone in the work force.works with.

B00E00P5JC|5.0|TURBO is a great children's movie no matter how you look at it. I never like to compare previous films a film's inspiration. Yet, I often do. In this case I found TURBO to be very original.  TURBO is original and innovative film making. The characters and visuals are charming and amusing. It is much more than I expected. This film is definitely worth a look. Yes, I liked it from a kid's and adult's perspective too! It charms the young and young at heart. Fast paced charming stuff here!
B00EJYT0FY|4.0|i always dug this cut and its a bit underrated in the Jackson five catelog if you ask me. dig the groove  and the way the lyrics hit about getting things together. it was very soulful and on point.  this is one of those tracks where you can groove to it in your  ride and hit the  club.
B00447G2PM|5.0|IMAX:DEEP SEA is a beautifully captivating and wondrous film of the living seas. This is majestically bold and beautiful. It is simply breathtaking. I don't come by this type of entertainment every day. This film is steep in wondrous beauty. When I was a lad this would have been one of my favorites forever!
B001U0HBQ0|2.0|This was not the Criterion Collection. It was supposed to include two disc's and it only came with one (didn't include the bonus disc).
B006WXHJNU|4.0|This movie is sort of awesome in a strange way! Nortan's performance is outstanding. When the Hulk comes out what a change. This movie is actually totally freaking awesome to the dark side! They pulled it off, however. I never thought they would. I never thought they could. This movie is an interesting experience. Another movie is one for the books.
B003V5CFV8|5.0|it is one of the best of the older movies I have seen lately. I would recommend this to everyone.

B00EDX76PW|5.0|PERCY JACKSON: SEA OF MONSTERS is an interesting film depending how you look at it. I never like to compare literary works to the film counterpart. Why start now?

Great character studies abound. Yes. I liked it. I believe this film is worth a look. Dogged energy and more abounds here.
B003G4W49C|5.0|100 pursuant good . My favorite  part is the battle room.<br />My name is Emma Watson and I love you.
B008JFUO4U|5.0|As my old friend Bernie would say, \\"You can't go wrong!\\" And you can't. Trust me! This is a very handsomely filmed movie, brilliantly paced and utterly thought provoking. This is the way to enjoy a Saturday afternoon. This film will really brighten up your day and recharge your batteries. OBLIVION is a thinking man's movie. Tom Cruise is as good as ever. Morgan Freeman has never given a bad performance and he proves it here once again. I liked it. I though it was hard not to.
B00AYB1RGG|4.0|Guy flick...bombs,big guns lots o' blood and let's not forget explosions...not bad. Worth a look on a slow day or night.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|So much fun for the whole family. Keep saying one more round but find myself still playing hours and hours later. Love the graphics and that you can play against your Facebook friends. Can't wait to play more.
B000067FP8|1.0|Wasn't happy when I opened it o watch it with my grandson and it was pride and prejudice I don't even know what that movies about not a gremlin lol but I called amazon there exchanging it for free I was happy and will have it in 2 days thanks amazon
B0083Z614S|5.0|Refreshingly simple and profound.  This well written classic will lift your spirit and set your soul to wondering why we so easily overlook the everyday mysteries and miracles of life.
B00CBFPO12|5.0|Chris is the most wonderful person and every time I get amazed at how everything seems to fall into place. Another great read by Chris Colfer!
B00D7JGL36|5.0|A unbelievable tribute to the artist and a period in country music,i use to hate this music when i was a teen rocker but now the words and style stust make smile.Buy it and sing along with the sad stories most men can laugh about now.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I've tried two free weather apps, and this is my favorite. It seems to be more accurate than the Weather Channel app, which is, of course, awesome! It's easy to have multiple locations saved (so I can see weather for city where I live, where I go to school, and where I work). It's very user friendly. I totally recommend this app if you're looking for a free weather app.
B00A8ECU24|2.0|App freezes frequently and can't exit.  Must restart Kindle to force it to close.  Sounds like it used to work....based on other ratings.
B009A9BEHU|5.0|I love Coldplay.<br />this CD has all my favs by Coldplay on 1 disc.<br />the Live version puts me in a great mood.  i also enjoyed watching the DVD.
B004EPYZZ8|5.0|I was impressed to see how Bethany Hamilton (the real soul surfer) had a hand in the making of the movie.  It was a very well done movie.  The acting was great so great you actually thought it was real when they were making the movie.  I give it a 5 star rating!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I downloaded this app before ever seeing the movies. Frankly I downloaded it because my boyfriend played it nonstop and I was curious what the fuss was. Its perfect for just about any age and is a great escape whether you have five minutes or an hour! My boyfriend just got an upgrade that has a new area...Minion Beach. I sure hope I get one too!!!!
B000E5DL84|4.0|Burt Lancaster sure looks good! Love the technicolor film of this time period.  Would watch it again on a Sunday lazy afternoon
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I want to start out with the most positive thing I can, the story had potential. I did find myself wanting to know more about the main character, Mr. Grey and hoped the story was evolving but it fell flat. With all the hype, I decided to read this book despite my dislike for romance novels. With all the hype, I expected...more.<br />The writing was clumsy, the story didn't go anywhere and when all else failed a sex scene was thrown in. I found myself skipping pages to get by the erotica which was mostly gratuitous and unnecessary. I almost didn't finish this one; I can not make myself read the sequel much less all three. I haven't been this disappointed in a \\"Best Seller\\" in a really long time.
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|Just an awesome, well done ghost story! This is my favorite season so far. Great story and not as &#34;gruesome&#34; as season 2 ( although that one was fantastic in it's own right!).
B00BL5YQKS|5.0|It is a brash show about the rough side of police work that works and how it can go out of control.
B00CL151G4|3.0|I have watched most of the first series and, while it is enjoyable, I have to agree with a three star reviewer (often the most considered) which read, \\". . . . overarching story seems secondary to the CSI -like formulaic crime drama. The cases became old hat and standardized by the end of the season, and Sherlock's \\"brilliant\\" deductions are often lackluster. . . . . . .  he comes across as a bit of a savant. . . . . thus far, the story has gone nowhere. There are no villains left standing, no one who truly challenges Sherlock, and there is no actual plot that ties one episode to another aside from a blah-blah-blah-I'm-an-addict schtick. At the end of each episode they give you a Grey's Anatomy song and get nice and sentimental about themselves. It's as predictable as much of the dialog.\\"  Rather an accurate review.  In search of ratings, this series may decline further into the usual US crime drama formulaic trash.  On the other hand, it may develop into something exceptional.  It's not there yet; not even close.
B00AYB1RGG|5.0|I loved this movie. Drug slinging, ass kicking, babysitting the rookie, with lots of boom to go. I hope they make another one.
B00AEBBA72|5.0|Johnny Depp is brilliant and the ensemble cast was perfect in this adaptation of Sleepy Hollow. It has  become a favorite to watch and this movie just doesn't get old.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This game is tons of fun the first day I got it I could not stop playing I highly recommend this game for everyone
B009NH6JRE|5.0|Love this show.  One of the best shows I have seen.  Not one of those shows that you can always guess whats happening next.  You never know who's going to die.  story line is great.  Acting amazing for a TV show.  Won't be sorry if you get these videos.
0446699616|1.0|I have read many DeMille booiks and always enjoyed them.  May be my taste has changed but I got through 87 pages of<br />\\"the Panther\\" and finally gave up.  What is clever, interesting or funny about all the wisecracks after every interaction with<br />someone.  No more DeMille for me.
B00EDX76PW|4.0|Made well.  Good teen pretty exciting. Not scary for children.  I even enjoyed as an adult.  Computer graphics are good and acting well done.
B00CKOYVG8|3.0|not what I thought it would be, ok but not my  favorite angry birds game not much of a challange
B00B769XB8|2.0|This item was labeled 'UNRATED' in the description. So, I'm guessing most people would think that all three videos came that way. WRONG!!! Only the BluRay Video is unrated. The DVD and the 3D DVD are both the theatrical versions (which cuts out quite a bit of the movie, btw).
B007B6VOG0|4.0|Great value for this record. Really like the mood that each song gives. Out on the town is my favorite

0307352153|3.0|I am a ambivert; half extrovert and half introvert.<br /><br />Recently, I have observed that I have been behaving unusually unlike an extrovert that I believed I was. Through a recommendation by another true Introvert, who seemed very much different than who I was, I picked up Quiet. As soon as I read the reviews done by the many introverts, I realized that I also carry introverted characteristics/traits. As I thought I was very social and out-going, I have failed to notice the reasons why I must come home for some quiet time after a few hours of being out and socializing. From there, other behaviors that was once thought unique about myself started to take on a different definition... Introversion.<br /><br />Quiet was a book I was very eager yet dreaded to read. I was on the verge of discovering and defining something new about myself...<br /><br />I am half-way through Quiet and I am not very motivated to pick it up and continue reading. This book lacks depth and the style of writing is not quite up to what I expected. Half way through the book and I feel like I am still skimming on the surface of something... It is as though Cain wrote Quiet to validate and justify the existence of Introverts rather than defining and explaining how Introverts' mind work. I am disappointed even if I do identify myself with some of Cain's examples from the book.<br /><br />Enough said.<br /><br />I will next read \\"Thinking, Fast and Slow\\" and I will then make a comparison...
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Easy to use, this app has replaced my bedside clock.  It is great for travel ,no need for wake-up calls.  You can choose to have your own music wake you, or some of the app alarms. The best value for the money.

0441172717|5.0|Speaking of hard to get into books ... No, that's not fair. I was interested in this book from page one. But the way it's written is so very dense. My copy of Dune is 489 pages, if I count only the story and no appendixes. There are no chapters. Each section is broken up by a quote from the Princess Irulan, whom we don't meet until much later. If you've seen the miniseries, they changed things and put her in way too early. Hollywood, anyway.<br /><br />This is another book I'm thankful I put in the time to read. It was hard work, but this book was fascinating. It was written in 1965 and the storyworld is magnificent. I was very impressed with the depth of the author's creativity in building the planet Arrakis (aka Dune) and the politics of the universe. Everything was so complex, which is part of why it was such a tough read for me. I had to go slowly if I was going to catch everything. And there were lots of names that were too similar. But I loved this book. Really neat. (But I hate the cover on this re-release. Bo-ring!)
B009KS4XRO|1.0|Games are getting entirely too difficult to complete and there are too many glitches in the games<br /><br />You can never get ahead.  Prizes are too low for what you have to spend to complete.  I,and most of the folks playing,like the ability to trade items.  Now there are more items you cannot gift or trade.
0375842209|5.0|This book was excellent. But it took me a while to think so. Seriously! It took me almost a month to get past the first thirty pages. Once I did, I was hooked. But the perspective of death is just so bizarre, I found it difficult to connect until we were solidly with Liesel.<br /><br />This is a powerful book. It tells the story of a German girl in World War II. I've read many stories of Jewish people from that war, but I found this perspective fascinating. The characters were so unique and wonderful. I loved Rudy most of all. Just adored the kid. This isn't a happy book. There are happy parts, but the ending is heartbreaking. I bawled. I'm not talking mere weepiness. I needed tissues. And when I finally finished, it I understood why everyone said I had to read it. It was an experience I carried around for days.<br /><br />I also appreciated the way the author warned us what was coming. Death gave us spoilers. When I first read them, I thought, \\"You can't do that!\\" thinking of all the writing rules I've been taught. But the thing is, it was brilliant storytelling. Knowing what was going to happen made every fun scene painful. A perfect example of how to break those writing rules on purpose. If you haven't read this, put it on your list and don't give up! It's well worth it.

The best feature for me is the \\"walkie talkie\\" feature that allows you to talk/sing to the baby when you're not around. For my husband, he likes that he gets to watch the baby when he has a break at work, so he won't miss her too much.<br /><br />I also like the light feature that provides some sorts of hypnotizing effect when my baby is fussy.<br /><br />One thing I'm not really extremely happy with is the limited choices of the lullabies. However, my husband and I enjoy the soothing \\"ocean\\" sound on it. Sometimes my husband fell asleep faster than the baby with the ocean waves...<br /><br />Overall, I love this product. And all my friends or family are amazed by this product, and wish there was something like this when their kids were little.<br /><br />Oh, one tip for the user, don't not shut down the monitor, just leave it ON all the time. It gives me troubles when I turned it on and off worrying that the electronic product is too close to my baby. Sometimes it doesn't connect well with a weak wifi connection.
0525478817|5.0|Best book ever.  Brilliantly written and so many quotables.  Very well written, smart, witty, heart wrenching and great to devour
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This is my first game which I got from my first kindle fire HD. This is really a fun game. I love to build my own Iron man.
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|I love the Star Trek movies and this collection is fantastic. To get all of them and the extra narrative at this price is just great!
1891252089|5.0|I have found it my everyday manual to learn and improve my Yoga practice, he is clear to the point. Anybody who wants to start a yoga practice will benefit from it, but will also be able to develop and perfect ir. It is awesome.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I LOVEEEEEEEE THIS CANT WAIT TILL THE MOVIE COMES OUT!!! I WISH IT WOULD CONTINUE TO GO ON AND ON AND NEVER STOP!!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I absolutely love this game!<br />I've even told a few friends to jump on the bandwagon :)<br />I play this regularly.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|I am a student so the most important thing for me in a pdf reader is the annotation capability. The actual tools are great. I am certain that in the week since I received my Kindle Fire HD, I have tried every pdf app available. This is almost the best, but with one fatal flaw. It seems there is no way to pull up the text of all your comments and highlights in a little transparent bar off to the side. That is such a useful tool for a student, it is a shame it appears to be missing. I paid for the apps that have it. I would gladly pay for a version of this app that has that feature.<br /><br />UPDATE: I just realized I could use the tools on this app, save it, open it with Repli-go or pdfMax, and the comment search tool and display will pick up what I did in Adobe. Who could ask for anything more? The night mode is also excellent on this app. The other apps' night modes don't seem to work.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I am so in love with this book, it's ridiculous!!!!!!!! I think it's better than the first book! It's awesome and I recommend it for everyone! GET IT!!!!
B00E978FGQ|4.0|Good cast and very entertaining. the kind of movie you'd want to watch again. Mostly appropriate for 14 year olds and older.
B008RVAAPE|5.0|Having read and seen Pillars of the Earth on TV I was intersted to see how World without end would compare.<br />I found it to be just as good as the first book, which is unusual bcause the sequel is sometimes disappointing, but, not in this case. The story is easy to follow, the characters realistic and believable. There are many true to life, in those days twists and turns, right to the end. Enjoyed immensely.<br />Dave Hunsley
B0063IH60K|4.0|I enjoy having this on my tablet.  It is nice to have something to play while waiting in the doctor's waiting room.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I loved this book as much as the first.  I was a little confused about the crash but immediately realized Jack was the cause.  Did Christian go for the ring?<br /><br /> I am having trouble remembering so much intense sex at that age, but the book did bring back fond memories of various surfaces in a vacation condo shortly after my marriage.  I thought the books would be more about people in their 50's as I am, but I still relate.<br /><br />It is a testament to the curative power of love and evidence based problem solving therapy which I just learned upon my return to Social Work in an HIV/AIDs Center!<br /><br />Can't wait for book3.
B004GYY714|4.0|It is nice to be able to move around and keep the station near me.  It comes in so much better than on our radios.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|Draws you into a world so devastatingly real yet equally unimaginable!  A lesson in why we are so blessed to live in a free society and a warning to be vigilant in valuing and protecting that freedom.  An amazingly gripping novel and one that will haunt you.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I enjoy having a calculator near when I need one.  It works great for me.  It is easy to use.
B001NEK2GE|5.0|This is much more comfortable than my keyboard, and the joystick can come in handy sometimes as well. I really like it, there's nothing bad that I have noticed so far!
B002N3GD2Q|5.0|Great CD box set that is not available in music retail stores in Australia. Amazon is so easy and I received it well within the time frame.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|I just wanted to get the RSS feed from Digg but ended up with Feedly and content from all my favorite sources.  Now I can browse through them all together our separately.
B005BRS8Z6|4.0|An amazing book as many other people have concluded in their reviews. I just wish he would have given a little bit more help on how to apply this as a practice.
B00D8WJ9JK|1.0|some songs seem ok but nothing that stands out and i was jus looking for one to buy so I don't know why people are saying best hip hop album plzzz....try t-rock \\"papers\\" album ..much much better.
B004G6TD3O|5.0|Never gets old!!! If I were marooned on an island, this would be my choice of only one album. Great!
B008K6HN8I|4.0|Functionally, it does everything I expect.<br /><br />Cosmetically, there are much prettier apps out there but the simple interface is easy and works well.<br /><br />I'd much rather have ugly and simple than pretty and useless.  Just had to knock it down a star because of cosmetics.
B00B8R1NP0|1.0|This book starts with an appealing premise: you know all those people who chat with a cashier in line while you steam in the line behind them, late for an appointment?  Wouldn't it be satisfying to erase them?<br /><br />Unfortunately, this book does not do a good job of developing that premise.  To start with, the protagonist Max Larkin is the best detective in Rockton, Illinois, at age 29. He is paired with rookie detective Jesse Fairlane, just promoted after 4 years on the force. Dialogue goes like this: \\"The murderer did more than kill a local couple; he killed this whole town.\\" Captain Williams sighs. \\"Wow, that's terrible!\\" exclaims Max.\\"  Wow, that's terrible? From a veteran cop? Meanwhile, Jesse can't keep her hands to herself. After interviewing witness Melissa, \\"Melissa nods her head and when she thanks Jesse for all she did, Jesse hugs her\\"; later \\"Jesse pats the manager on the shoulder.\\" First of all, I don't think even rookie cops are that touchy-feely.  Second of all, no one touches strangers these days.  There are numerous editing errors (multiple words, a \\"black haired man with black hair and a beard\\", and, my personal favorite, the \\"stained glass screen door.\\")<br /><br />The characters are never developed. They do unbelievable things, like Max telling his nightmares to Jesse a few days after meeting her for the first time. Max finds out his parents are really his aunt and uncle, who took him in after his parents died when he was a young child, and his emotional response has no resonance: not anger, not repression, just a nameless, blameless, mild \\"they acted as my parents, so I forgive them\\".<br /><br />The plotting is equally unbelievable; the blood-soaked murderer goes out of various houses and apartments without being seen; nurses in the hospital gossip and giggle like \\"high-school girls\\" when flowers are delivered to the nurse's station (when was the last time you saw a nurse giggle?); and the final plot twist is completely unbelievable, a coincidence that I saw coming half a book ahead.<br /><br />Don't waste your time with this one.  For a good mystery, try John Sanford, JD Robb, Carol O'Connell, or any other good writer.
B00AIA89HS|5.0|buy it now if you dont have it.your missing out if you dont.if your going through hard times this is the cd for you.( as pantera says unscared by trails!!!)
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|I am enjoying this book and appreciate the historical political perspective that isn't weighed down in theology.  Regardless of your beliefs this is a good book
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very enjoyable and addictive game. can't  wait to play some more. I do sort of wish there were some type of hint option available though.
B00BC5I6Q2|5.0|We live in Washington DC and that made watching this more fun.<br /><br />The show demonstrates Washington's obsession with power over money and the means towards achieving power.<br /><br />Kevin Spacey's acting is impeccable as usual.  The supporting cast are very good also.  Nice to see an intelligent show without all the violence and car chases.
B009LQKHIO|4.0|I loved the story line, but I had trouble getting past the grammatical errors. Otherwise I would have given this 5 stars.
B009LQKHIO|2.0|This book is choppy and often repeats itself making it hard to follow. You don't really get a sense of the main characters relationship, except for explicit physical scenes.  The guy is always getting angry/jealous which makes you feel like she might be headed into another abusive relationship.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This game keeps me occupied for long periods of time when I have nothing to do. I have really enjoyed this game. Thank you very much!!
B00CW7KK9K|4.0|Calorie counter may be off when compared to other products doing the identical workout. Great accessory for my Withing Wireless Scale. I wear it all the time to track my movements. Good motivational tool.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My kids love playing this game. And its a good pass time for me as well. I would recommend this game to my friends (:
B007EECSFA|5.0|Very good read. I enjoyed watching the characters unfold and had not anticipated the final chapters.  There were some good descriptions of living in London during WWII that made you feel you were there.  Very much recommended.
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|Loved it .would reccomend to anyone looking for a fun challenge and loves to solve puzzles or play charades.can be addictive but makes you use your brains and think. Everyone should try it.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|I saw this one in the theatre, and was browsing this one on the Amazon Instant Video, because I'd like to watch it again. Amazon is giving a HUGE SPOILER in the first sentence of they synopsis for this movie, when they name the antagonist.<br /><br />You only see this when shopping the Instant Video, not DVD or BluRay.<br /><br />I didn't know who the guy was when I saw this the first time, and spent half an hour trying to figure out just who the hell it was. When the story finally unfolds and reveals the relevant information, it was an real epiphany, and it made the movie a lot more interesting for me.<br /><br />What Amazon has done with this careless blurb is akin to Homer Simpson walking out of Empire Strikes Back and blurting out in front of the people in line: \\"Who would've believed that Darth Vader was Luke Skywalker's father?\\"<br /><br />Again, \\"Into Darkness\\" is top notch, and I highly recommend it for anybody who enjoys Star Trek in any form.<br /><br />Update 9/10/13<br /><br />As suggested, I'm changing my rating to reflect my satisfaction with the movie, and not my dissatisfaction with Amazon.<br /><br />To clarify, I have no illusions about the proliferation of spoilers. I just think this was a sloppy bit of work on Amazon's part.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|Just love watching this series. It is well written and the cast is wonderful! Do yourself a favor and pick this up.
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|I loved that this season can stand alone.  It ends nicely.  Doesn't leave you in suspense for the next season to come out.  The actors are awesome.  The stories are excellent.  I like how it starts each episode with another clue of what happened in the Murder House.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|... well i cant really descibe how i feel about this so i guess all i have to say is WATCH THE DAMN SHOW!
6305428042|5.0|I don't remember the first time I watched this movie but i do know i have watched it every year around halloween. I LOVE LOVE LOVE this movie! My grandmother used to record it on VHS for me every year(it would always end up lost or broken). I love halloween and the movies that comes with that time of year and this is definitely top 3! To me this is more than a movie now. My first cat was a 5 day old black kitten born on October 16 of 2007. He was abandoned by his mom so i bottle feed and cared for this kitten like my own child. from the moment i looked at him he melted my heart and i named him Thackery Binx, Binx for short. ;) HE was more everything unfortunately he passed in 2010 during a very bad winter. His sweet caring mature and lovable personality was just like the characters. It great to watch this movie and remember him along with my childhood.
B007N85ZXY|5.0|As a long time Neil Young fan, especially with Crazy Horse, I think this is by far his best work of the past decade! I love the \\"RAW\\", unrefined sound of Crazy Horse. The music is made to be listened to the way music should be heard, powerful, raw, unrefined and fantastic. Only Neil could take these songs and turn them into what he has. A very distinct sound with bright imagination. A musical masterpiece.
1596680296|5.0|Very thorough and with directions for all yarns types and sock styles.  Readable and accurate producing great results.  Treat yourself with a classic you will use over and over.
B002ZG99CC|5.0|I love the hanging-up of the coat as the basis of his whole kung fu technique. It teaches valuable lessons about playing string instruments--finding the connection between exotic activities like violin playing and natural, every-day movements.
B00E5Q1HJS|5.0|Loved it in the theater and loved it on the TV. Fun, good story, great special effects and actors. I laughed. I cried.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Fun and pretty to look at.  Great for kindle.  Not to challenging easy relaxed play.  Best for kindle.  Graphics are very good.  Underwater scenes are will done and colorful
B005HSG3TC|4.0|Pros:<br />- hard-back case/shell, unlike the faux-leather that may become worn out and look old<br />- case clips to kindle, so it sits flushed with screen, unlike the leather case which may go over the edge of the kindle screen border, making it difficult to press the keys sometimes<br />- it's THIN.  i had a leather one before that made the kindle quite bulky-feeling<br /><br />Cons:<br />- not sure how long the elastic band may last or how it'll look after a few months or years (will it become frayed?  i guess i'll wait and see).<br /><br />Bottom line:  I'd recommend it.  It's a minimalist approach.  Product is very reasonably priced.  Case is simplistic in design but does what it's purposed to do.
B003I55BIA|5.0|I purchased this on a whim.  I had been reading very heavy books and wanted a light love story.  This book was much better than anticipated.
B001HN6940|5.0|First time buying used, had my doubts. Since some previously used items at the stores don't look like they are worth it. But I went ahead and gave it a try, and it paid off. The blu-ray was just as if it were brand new. Watched it as soon as I got it, which was quick. Everything went well and looked great. No defects or scratches. Will definitely buy from them again in the future.
B005VC4FLW|4.0|Tried out my new Blue Ray player that had amazon video service on it by buying a copy of this movie.  I had seen it before and felt it would be a good one to own, not just rent.
B00004XMTJ|5.0|The music is phenomenal!  I've seen the musical live and it is amazing.  The artist singing Memories is extremely talented.
B00COGXX7A|5.0|This is a wonderful chick flick!  I got to watch it with my sister and daughter and we all loved it.  Great story with a fun twist.
6304806418|5.0|Antonio Banderas is great!  Madonna is great!  The music is beautiful!  Great story about Eva Peron and rise from poverty to fame.
B000AM2L1O|5.0|Although I didn't purchase this doll my 2 year old grand daughter loves this one.  Since she received this in aug it must go everywhere with her and is the only animal or baby to go to bed with her.  Her idea and is so cute to see her sleep with arm around her baby .  If you are on the fence buy this one
B00CWY76CC|5.0|:)<br />this game  holds  my attention  for longer than  most lol i just  love  this  game. my eight year old is also  addicted  to this  game
B001NLKZUA|5.0|I have read the first and now the second book and I love it! I personally think it is better and more surprising than the hunger games. I would most defiantly recommend this book to all my friends! I can't stop reading this series!!
B002APU580|5.0|Although not entirely true to the novel, this is by far the best movie about this Jane Austin book in my opinion.  The actors are some of my favorites  I love it!
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This App was very easy to use and it works great! I use it as my backup alarm to wake us up in the AM, and it has saved us from being late a few times already! I like all the features it has and its very easy to use! Get this app, you will be thankful you did!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I love this game! The graphics are great, and it's much more than just a hidden object game. With many other puzzles and mini-games throughout, it's sometimes tough to put down!
0765357151|3.0|If you've seen the movie, the book disappoints...also includes a bunch of short stories which are mostly good, but a few are poor.
B004H4XL7E|4.0|Oren really knows what he's talking about - his experience is invaluable!! This is a great resource guide for anyone who sells or pitches anything!
B00AEFY66U|5.0|The music, the costumes, the casting, and most of all, the acting all contribute to the excellence of this film.  Add its faithfulness to Fitzgerald's text, and we have a winner!
B001ANYDAO|5.0|Love Malcolm's perspective & story-telling ability. He's a pro at making great analogies - highly recommend reading this - it should be on your short list if you haven't read it.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|Solo tengo q decir q las 3 peliculas fueron increibles. La remasterizacion quedo de lujo. Los negros y colores quedaron tambien que no se perdio ni un solo detalle. Compra de 5 estrellas
B00D6GT5S8|5.0|I have been a Major Sigur Ros fan for Quite some Time.  This album drives their sound into Interesting and rather New Territory.  A Few of the songs are a little Harder than they've done Before, but that is what gives this CD such a Cool, Wild, and Haunting Feel.  If you are a fan of their Softer, somewhat Laid Back Sound, I don't know what you will think of this one.  However if you are anything like me, you are Very Willing to take a New Sonic Journey with a Much Loved Band like Sigur Ros.  Now don't be too scared to try it if the first song sounds too Un-Sigur Ros for you, Give the CD a chance and I think you will be finding that you like it more than you thought you would.  It is one of those Albums that is very...  Out of the Ordinary, but once you really Get INTO IT you start realizing that eventhough it seems Tumultuous you will start to find a Slightly Odd Calmness to it.  Even in the Harder Tracks.  Cause as you know [that is if you are already a fan] the Lead Singer's Lilting and Soaring voice is one that can take a Driving Beat and turn it into a Oddly Beautiful piece of music that can take you to places that you wouldn't expect that kind of Beat could take you.  If you are Not already a fan, this may not be the Best Place to start, but if you want to get turned on to their sound with something a little Unorthodox for the band, before moving on to their other sounds, Feel Free, just know that this isn't their NORMAL Sound.  But it is still in True Sigur Ros Form.  Give it a shot, and see what You Think Yourself instead of taking only MY WORD for it.
0385342071|5.0|First let me start by saying I enjoy books where the main character is the narrator of the story.  To me it just makes the story that much more enjoyable. I couldn't put this book down.  Once I finished reading I was left feeling giddy and I had a smile on my face thinking of the characters and the ending. I immediately jumped on my facebook page and recommended this book to all of my friends.  I love the ease in which Sophie writes the story.  I also enjoyed the footnotes at the bottom of the pages.  I'm reading a new book and I find myself looking at the bottom for a footnote.  This is my new favorite book.  I just purchased Sophie's other book \\"Wedding Night\\".  This is my new favorite book.  I will be checking out all of Sophie Kinsella's books.  Great author - great book.
B00BRH2MN8|5.0|I heard &#34;Royals&#34; on the radio before  I got this EP.  I knew I was in for a Interesting Sound when I got it, but I wasn't Fully Prepared for the Full Coolness of the sound I was about to Experience.  Bravado- Wonderful Opener to the Album.  Nice and Laid Back.  Royals- Fun, Cool, and just all around Wonderful Song.  Million Dollar Bills-  Nice Driving Beat.  The Love Club-  Kind of In Between Driving Beat and Laid Back.  A Good Combination for the Album.  The last Song is one of my Favorites on the EP Ranking right up there with Royals, but for a Different Reason.  The last song being Biting Down.  This is one of those songs that is Haunting, and Odd, but Extremely Addicting.  Now I admit some people will listen to this song and be like &#34;Why is this Considered a Song?&#34;  But it is one of the Songs that I just LOVE to listen to.  Its The Haunting Feel of it that just makes it one of the songs that makes you go hhhhhmmmmmm!?!?!  The Driving Bass Line and almost Chirping Sound mixed together is Genius.  Once you hear this song, I think you will understand why I am saying what I am about this.  All Around this Album is Perfect for those people like me that like our Music a little on the...  Unorthodox Side.  That is why I am giving this one a Five Stars.
140006922X|5.0|Reviewers have taken to loving the phrase, &#34;None of this is new ground.&#34; Yet, Aslan writes with efficiency and historical fascination about a world-changing figure about whom the evidence is otherwise very slight. He takes you back to the times of Roman hegemony and religious fanaticism, demonstrates what was likely, unlikely, and impossible. His description of what Pilot would have and would have not done is engrossing. Counterintuitively, for me, he relies a great deal on the Gospels to make his points, which I found interesting but questionable as factual sources.<br /><br />Aslan being Muslim has nothing to do with the book or his conclusions. His treatment of the Bible as representative of the times—teaching moral points, not acting as historical record—puts the correct framework on his approach. I detest the BCE ACE political correctness nonsense, but that's a quibble with a fabulous, scholarly view of the great landmark events that affected billions of people ever since, and the man in the middle of them.
B0084AXZK0|4.0|I thought this read was quite interesting but it was a bit waffly, I mean how many pages need to be dedicated to flowers, perfume and fabric. I am always amazed by some of the so called classics and how self-indulgent the authors were.<br />All in all I liked it-but I skipped alot of the filler and the side-stepping of some of the more controversial themes at times.
B00CEQ1HOQ|5.0|Check out my video review at: [...]<br />I was impressed by the quality of this item. It certainly was better than expected. Please see my video review for more.
B00371QQ0M|4.0|One of the greatest sci-fi classics is back on the screen and looking beautiful. If you like Star Wars check this movie out and you'll see where Geoge Lucas got most of his ideas for the original trilogy. Explore the creative world of Frank Miller and the desert planet Arrakis (Dune) home of the spice and ginormous sand worms!
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|this is a fantastic game. it is fast paced and challenging. the missions are difficult but not to difficult to discourage.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I haven't been playing long, but I've really enjoyed playing. I like how I am able to progress in the game without spending money.
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|I knew nothing of Lindsey Striling until her music came up on my Pandora station.  Now I am hooked.  I love the violin sound mixed with the dub step.  Not many mix-ups work, but all of her songs do.
0316789798|5.0|This is a very cute/creative way to draw animals. Cannot wait to use this book with my son when he gets a little older and shows more interest in drawing pictures.
1401216676|5.0|This graphic novel is awesome.  The cover is beautifully drawn, the hard cover has pictures on it, the pages are thick and high quality, the story is phenomenal.  I got the book in a decent amount of time too, so I did not wait long.  Book arrived undamaged.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|this game is very habit forming once you start you can't put it down. Kinda slow at first but once you get the points to enhance your vehicle it's great. great vehicles and planets
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|A simple but fun and addictive game the voice was slightly creepy but I can get past that give it a try. But only if you have an hour or two to burn lol.
B00DHHWY9I|5.0|Having never read the book or seen the original film, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I am a DiCaprio fan, so that helps too. I immediately downloaded the book and read half of it the first night. I think that DiCaprio portrayed Gatsby very well. I will say that some of the music was a bit off for the 20's era, but I could look past that. Visually, the movie was beautiful.
0345525558|5.0|An amazing look into the life of someone growing up in foster care.  While many counties in California have very proactive Social Service departments, there are many that are completely inadequate and understaffed.  This is a must read for anyone who cares about the children in the care of the government.  Once you do read, find a way to get involved because these children need you!
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Finally after 3 books Gideon and Eva get their sort of happily ever after. Too bad, this is not the end of their story. What more could Ms. Day throw at them?? With some of the new issues she has setup for the 2 of them, there could be many. I will say for all the mess they have gone through in their relationship, those two, now more than ever, have been and always will be a united front. I love couples like that. I do have to admit my hate and trainwreck title I always gave them did subside towards the end. I actually LIKED them! Ok, I’m going to admit it.......My heart has thawed for Mr. Cross. I just wanted to hug Gideon in this book. Just too damn sweet and has matured, considerably, with this book. Eva I liked in book 2, book 1 I wanted to kicked her. She still has alot of maturing to do. And honestly, she needs to let the past be the past. She has a good man by herside who has finally proven that he loves her unconditionally, so she needs to stop with her nonsense. One thing I have to say about Ms. Day, she can write one hell of a sex scene. Talk about HOT, STEAMY SEX. The scenes in the club and airplane were the most memorable. I will say this book did drag and took me over a week to finish. The first two books I read in 3 days each. It just didn’t grab me like the first two, BUT it was still a good story nonetheless. After thinking it over my real rating is a 4 out of 5. Note there is a book 4 and 5 coming out. Hopefully soon. They need their official happily ever after. These two deserve it!
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Great game when you need to pass time like at Dr. Or dent. Take with me everywhere<br />Give it a chance ads just x, out and continue game<br /><br /> Time
B0066WJLU6|3.0|Some extra features that aren't very usable although cute.  I would prefer a 1 touch button to get a flashlight
B0000TB03W|5.0|This concert from Grant Park in Chicago is most likely her best outdoor show EVER!  I t also is where the Bulls held their NBA Championship rallies after they won all their titles in the 90's! The Blackhawks also had their title winning rally back in June after disposing the stinki'n Boston Bruins for the Stanley Cup!  Back to Shania. I like Rock n Roll the best,and in her book From This Moment On, she likes the same bands as I do and I am sure many other fans of her's do too. COOL!  She likes the Eagles' Earth Wind and Fire, the Doobie Brothers, Gordon Lightfoot, Caren Carpenter of of courseThe Carpenters Terry Jacks's doi'n Seasons in the Sun and other top groups of that time era which is considered the best era, period for rock music! So, the woman definitely has great taste for music from the word GO! She has all of these elements in her songs which we true rockers will love forever! I only saw her videos on cable over the years but finally got on her web back in May and at the top is that FREE gig from Grant Park in Chicago. I being quite knowledgeable about music was totally elated by how good she and her band played that night back in July 2003. Good God they sure do play them violins and keyboards like real pros and accomplished musicians!  With 3 dudes on guitars and what, 3 or 4 playing those good o'l country fiddles plus J.D. Blair on drums with those cool looking goggles and shades which he switches them on and off during the concert. He gives a different look I've never seen by a drummer and I have been to many concerts at the Philadelphia Spectrum since the 70's!  I just can't get enough of Shania's concert and am very glad I got the DVD a few weeks ago which is better than the computer one because it has 6 additional songs on it and she goes into the front of the crowd and sings She's Not Just a Pretty Face holding arms and hands with some cool young girls who you can tell love her and her music! Her love songs bring tears to my eyes such as Forever and For Always and From This Moment On. Gotta go now, I'm pressed for time. I really love her very much and always carry the UP! lyric and songbook with me everyday so I can adore her gorgeous face! I wish I could meet her and I am sure we would get along just fine talking about music and sports. She is an athletic type woman and grew up wanting to be with the guys and be a rugged type girl, not the softie kind! Just look at her all over that stage running around never getting tired at all and singing real damn good! Hats off to her band too!

B00AECGQF2|5.0|I got this because it was the free app of the day, and I figured if it was too little kiddy, I have a little sister I figured would like it. So I got it, and I really was impressed! It's fun and creative, giving me a way to look at different hairstyles. You can cut, shave, or razor cut, the hair, as well as this nice little squeeze bottle thing labeled &#34;grow&#34; that makes the hair grow. Each section of hair is singular making for more creativity. then you go to the next spot and we have a flat iron, curler, and I'm thinking a crimper?  next spot you can shampoo, rinse, dry with a towel or air blow the hair. there's accessories and you can also take pictures that save to your device.<br /><br />Over all a GREAT game! =)<br /><br />also my sister loves this game too.

B00EQNYOYU|4.0|When the singles are the best songs on an album, you know it isn't going to be a good one. Aside from Came Back Haunted and Copy of A, the album is just not good. I'm a huge NIN fan-I have liked every NIN album from Pretty Hate Machine to The Slip and Ghosts, but this album falls well short.<br /><br />The vocals are very bad, and the lyrics are very cheesy in many of the songs. In fact, I think this album would've been much better without any vocals at all. They're just that bad. Instrumentally it's a synth-pop album that does little to separate itself from the million other acts out there these days. While Ghosts was experimental and had some great sounds, Hesitation Marks has pretty generic sounds and very few memorable ones.<br /><br />The sad thing is is that these songs aren't generically good either. They're flat out bad. There are flashes of brilliance-but all in all Trent's worst effort.<br /><br />** UPDATE **<br /><br />Original Review: 2 Stars<br /><br />After spending more time with the album, it definitely grew on me. While the \\"pop\\" feel of it was a bit different at first, the more you listen, the more you find similar sounds to the NIN albums from before. The album is different in many ways but also the same. It is an evolution of NIN sound moreso than a complete change. It definitely isn't as loud, though, so those STILL holding onto Broken will STILL be disappointed.<br /><br />4 Stars.

B005GY0Y8S|1.0|I could find nothing redeeming about this book.  Kept going for awhile thinking it had to get better.  But I was wrong.  Characters are not likeable or sympathetic.  Heroine is an idiot. Plot is all over the place.  Skipped to the end finally and found nothing to change my opinion.  I will not be reading any further books in this series or by this author.

B008ALA6DW|5.0|No driver or software installation required. Works great with Vmware Fusion 5 & 6 as well, extending ethernet connectivity to your virtual guests and OS's. As others mentioned, if you need to use your thunderbolt adapter for other reasons, this one could take up your slot. This one is also available in USB if you need to use both at the same time.

B00E8B1P9M|1.0|This was such a bad movie. I mean it started okay and then it transfered the \\"Joes\\" torch to the new guys aka the Rock and two actors I've never heard of or seen before who were awful. The scriptwriter was the worst offender. some lines were awful. This could be okay if you knew nothing about the GI Joes and wanted to see a movie with such unbelieveable action. The plot was thin and the action was so cgi I mean at least make it look real. I thought I was watching a play where the actors were being forced to read their lines. It was just trying to pay homage to too mny things and the plots were not related to the last movie. if it hadn't been hailed as the next movie for G.I. Joe and seperate then I might have had lower expectations. It was definitely not as good as the first, I agree it was okay mindlessness, the action scenes were awful. I expected more from Ray Stevenson and why does he try to have an American southern accent? The fight scene between him and The Rock was laughable. I have to say my favorite part of the movie was the WARDEN because Walter Goggins is a great actor delivered his lines with such sarcasm and I liked the time he was on the screen. The Snake Eye, Storm Shadow, Jinx part of the movie was just unnecessary. Save your money rent something else something good like X men First Class or Welcome to the Punch was better then this.
0385738781|5.0|Came in good shape, and it is an awesome book.  So many unexpected things happening within the first couple chapters.  I couldn't put it down!
B00ESY7QXI|5.0|I think everyone did a great job in this movie! From the acting to the costumes everything made the story told a great movie! This movie is a must see for 2013!
B00ELIKDXG|5.0|The adventure continues in 'The Lollipop', sequel to 'The Firebird'. Alex and Katie gets us in thrills again as they take us through another fun and magical adventure. Julia Gousseva writes with such skill that it's impossible not to get addicted to her books.
B00A2H9OZS|3.0|Forty-six year old Vin Diesel returns to the role and the movie series that rocketed his career in 2000, \\"Riddick\\". While \\"Chronicles of Riddick\\" tried to get too fancy, \\"Riddick\\" and \\"Pitch Black\\" proved that less is more.<br /><br />\\"Riddick\\" to me is a tale of two movies. The opening moments of the film find Riddick stranded on a sun-scorched planet and find him struggling to survive his wounds, the elements and the planets creatures. The first half of the movie, while simple and less eventful, is the most interesting part. As Riddick explores and uses his instincts and survival skills to stay alive, I was completely invested and enjoying a good old fashion science fiction adventure.  Later on, mercenaries join the story as they come after Riddick for the bounty on his head.<br /><br />The addition of more people to the story didn't lessen the film by any means. In fact, it just pushed the movie into a different direction and it was also very interesting. What did lessen the film though, was a collage of terrible dialogue, silliness and character motivations and personalities that changed from scene to scene.  I was completely enjoying the film and was prepared to call this the surprise hit of the near-summer, until the creators failed to proofread the final third of the film.<br /><br />A vicious mercenary named Santana is after Riddick's head and he is vicious, except for when he's being punched in the face by the one girl in the movie or if the scene calls for him to be comic relief. A silly kicking a sword scene served no purpose except for the creators to do something new and gruesome and it was so silly it made the audience laugh. Finally, a bold prediction by Riddick as he's chained up basically spelled out the entire finale of the film, including that the one girl in the film would be straddling him at the end. From that point on, as I watched each one of Riddick's predictions come true, I couldn't stop thinking about the 'straddling' part of his story.<br /><br />\\"Riddick\\" could have been good, or even great, but the filmmakers tried overtly to make things fun about halfway through the movie, not realizing that the movie was already fun. We were there. We were beside Riddick and his ability to friend a wild dog despite the dogs nature. Then the movie went into silliness land, it lost its edge and it reeked of a group of filmmakers trying too hard to make something entertaining.r /><br />\\"Riddick\\" could have been good, or even great, but the filmmakers tried overtly to make things fun about halfway through the movie, not realizing that the movie was already fun.

B00CXS55LG|5.0|Deafheaven are doing something different here. I can't put my finger on it, but when you hear it, you'll know. That moment didn't come to me until around the 8:10 mark on track 5 \\"Vertigo\\". I was driving late at night and when the blast beats came in, I just shook my head in disbelief, mouth open and wide-eyed. The utter emotion, the speed, the vision, all came together in an explosion of beauty, madness, re-birth, tragedy and everything else you feel when your world shifts and for a brief second you glimpse the diamonds of Indra's net. It is a rare and sacred experience and I'm glad to have been a part of it.

B00C33M2EE|5.0|As I write this review, I see there are already 100s of reviews here and many of them are of the standard \\"audio edition\\" of the CD. (Note that Amazon groups ALL versions of a CD together so always make sure which version a reviewer is commenting on and check the DATE of the review.) Yet the reviewers say how much they prefer the videos that these two talented guys (actually, it's confusing since there are really three - the third produces their videos and there is only one guy who plays the piano the other plays the cello!). Well, the Deluxe version gives you the CD with the 12 tracks of music and a 40-minute DVD with videos of 11 of them. (\\"Berlin\\" is the only one which is not on the DVD.) Yes, you can see them on Youtube but to see them on a large TV screen, with better resolution and sound, is worth the extra few dollars for the Deluxe edition.<br /><br />Note that not all the songs have both piano and cello. Some are just piano, some just cello. A few of the videos use special effects to good use while the others were filmed in outdoor scenes like by a waterfall or in a dessert.<br /><br />The due is coming to my area in October and the house is already sold olut - as I'm sure they are in many cities. They are the debut act  for the new Classical/crossover label created by Sony Masterworks.<br /><br />So, if you are a fan of the The Piano Guys, and don't have this CD yet, I'll suggest you go for the Deluxe Edition to get (almost\\" double the dose.<br />I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.<br /><br />Steve Ramm<br />\\"Anything Phonographic\\"
B001NLKZUA|5.0|I cried, I laughed and wanted to kill Valentine by the end. You must read it my favorite line from it is Jace saying to everyone at Luke's house &#34;who wants to do me&#34; talking about putting a rune that clary invented on his arm... I laughed so hard I was in tears!!!
B008I34ZFW|3.0|Really, if you're the kind of person who's going to like this film, you'll know you need to see it when you hear \\"moon Nazis invade the world.\\"  It's very well done, especially for a low budget.  I concur with some of the other reviewers who point out that some of the gags don't get developed and a lot of the movie doesn't quite pull together.  However, it's short enough that it keeps moving.  Udo Kier is great, as always, as the poor guy that hasn't been able to get anyone to heil his name for 60 years.<br /><br />\\"Iron Sky\\" isn't the best thing you'll ever see.  But, it's an entertaining movie for a Saturday night, and would be great with a group of  friends who like this sort of low-budget out-of-the-mainstream mayhem.
B00CDY6HW6|4.0|My daughter wanted to give this 5 stars because she enjoys playing it so much.  However, I only went with 4 because it seems like this app is continually updating and the updates take quite a while to download.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Could well be the best 007 flick yet. A beautifully made, well-scripted Bond flick which pays homage to the past of the franchise and sets the bar high for the next incarnations. Mendes directs the action sequences perfectly, with some memorable imagery (gorgeous in HiDef) which raises it nearly to the level of an art film. Judi Dench, Ralph Fiennes and villain Javier Bardem bring their high standards to the proceedings, and there's an enjoyable new take on \\"Q\\" as well. Need we add at this point that Daniel Craig is possibly the best James Bond of them all? Easily my favorite installment since the early days of Sean Connery. (There's a surprise bit in the latter section of the movie with a notable star. I suspect the part was originally offered to Connery, but I believe he has retired completely from acting, and probably wouldn't have wanted to have any more to do with 007 anyway.)
B007STXHTM|4.0|Excellent product! It met my expectations. The materials are good and the quality it's ok. The lens give me a good quality movie underwater.
B009L6UDUG|4.0|Easily my favorite of the Brosnan Bonds. 007 must team up with a female Chinese agent, played by none other than Michelle Yeoh. Yeoh quickly shows why she is a reigning superstar of martial arts action films. The look on Brosnan's face as she nonchalantly walks down a wall while tethered to a cable is priceless. Jonathan Pryce is a great choice for a villain inspired by media mogul Rupert Murdoch, and Roger Spottiswode's direction keeps things humming. Teri Hatcher (Lois Lane of \\"Lois & Clark\\") is one of a long line of hapless Bond girls whose big screen career didn't pan out, but she soon returned to TV and success in Desperate Housewives. Well worth an add to your 007 library. I only regret that Michelle Yeoh's character was not spun off into a series of her own!
B00BQ1D7BQ|5.0|As all work from This Guitar Hero, my only complain is that it lacks HDCD decoding as All new and remastered Neil<br />Young's work and they do sound much better.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This is a great game! Would like a hint option but love the b puzzle and critical thinking required to play
B00CPTUN5G|5.0|My little pony is a firm favourite in our household, my daughters 2 1/2 and 5 love both the TV show and the toys.  They love the movie and have to admit I quite like it myself.  It's lovely and colourful with great songs  and a nice moral message too. My daughters loved seeing the ponies and girls and love signing along to the songs. Lovely cheery inoffensive movie that has already been watched over and over and I'm sure will be loved for a long time.
0307950654|4.0|I usually hate Jane Austen continuations  and drop them after 1 chapter as they never get the characters or style right.  This is probably the only one I have actually finished! and is quite well written although Elizabeth is more passive than in Pride and Prejudice and is disappointing.  But it's the best of the copycat books that I've read.
B0058YPGSY|5.0|Great entertainment got started watching this show now I can't stay away from it season 6 starts Sept 10th  Love sons of Anarchy
B00CPTUNBK|5.0|A heartfelt movie great for all the family.  My family enjoyed it over and over again.  We were able to see it in the theaters too and it was a big hit with the bronies.
B00C8USQEM|5.0|One of the funniest TV shows ever, can watch it over and over and is still funny.<br />A must watch for the whole family.
1416955070|5.0|Wonderful start to a great series.  I have it in kindle and audio book as well.  I have already ordered the DVD too.
B002N5N5LG|5.0|This TV show combines a very diverse group of individuals, throws them into some weird situation, and produces a truck load of laughs, giggles, eye-brow raisers, and &#34;I wish I'd said that&#34; moments. A couple of the supporting characters are way over the top but the main group could be people living in your neighborhood, whether you want them or not. The show is very well written. Some of the DVD commentaries are very good but others fall flat. The Outtakes are hilarious.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|Great for picture editing!! I use this app all the time. I love that it has SO many options to edit in different ways. You can get really creative here. Or even if you just want to change the brightness or contrast of the photo you can easity do it here. you don't need Internet to use it. but if you have it gives you even MORE options. I love this APP.
B005DJGMQE|5.0|I always enjoy any historical or historical fiction in movies and books.<br />This movie taught me a few new things.<br />Well done!
B000FCKRDI|5.0|The characters all have such depth you feel as if they are real people. All the books have very different main characters and very different taste in men. I love how the story continues where most novels would end. I like that little extra plot as well as the glimpse into the future at the very end.
B008602KQI|5.0|Jennifer Lawrence really is a good actress-<br />this movie was very well done. I didn't think<br />I'd care for it-but I did!
B001F6TXME|5.0|I had a little difficulty when I first got this remote because I slid the button up to the top often.  Once it is slid up there there is no pressing it to take a pic.  This took me some getting used to.
B008XKSW7M|5.0|I really enjoyed this-it's another movie (at my age:63) I didn't think would interest me;<br />but I really got a kick out of it!
140006922X|5.0|As an educator  am always interested in learning more in what I teach...this adds to the topic, a good understandable perspective. Enjoyed the reading.

B0091REZMW|5.0|I have really enjoyed playing this game. Just requires patience and time.  Can move a little slow but very addicting
B000FA5SMK|4.0|The later Corey books are better, as it feels like the character is more developed.  Is there a book that describes how Corey was shot in the street?  It's referenced a lot and I would love to read that part of his life, but I haven't found it.<br />Mr. DeMille, please write a prequel if you haven't already!<br />This set has been so enjoyable, I've just loved every book and I'm in love with John Corey and I do not impress easily.<br />Mr. DeMille, you are incredibly talented, as I'm sure you've suspected.  You are quite the smarty pants too and I'd love to sit down with you and talk about foreign and domestic events.  I imagine you could explain a lot.<br />Thank you
B003TXSF5C|5.0|I really enjoyed it. A good summary and description of the different physical laws in our universe and the way they have been discovered.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|See the movie Looking For Sugarman as a plus for this music.<br />It is really great and easy listening to
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Loads of fun in an easy-to-use and interesting game. Lovely graphics as well! While I personally don't think this is an all ages game, not that it is inappropriate in any way shape or form, it's just geared towards a 12yrs old and above level. Enjoy!! ^^o^^
B0024Y9EYS|4.0|Overall the first season was a good addition to the Terminator back story.  We see John Conner growing up and becoming the future leader of the resistance with every tough decision he has to make.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is the best clue game ever!!!!! I love games like this one it keeps the mind active-it's good my kids like playing games like this one.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|I love Charles Dickens novels and of course A Christmas Carol is the ultimate christmas story.  It is a tradition in our family.  I will be directing a musical version and wanted to re read the original before I jumped into that project.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I love Gideon Cross and I dearly love Eva Trammell - both of their transformations were solid and profound to me...a few times, revealing certain events occurring in their lives, I was on edge as to how it would play out; but then found myself relieved as the characters trust and love blossomed beyond my expectations, and they were able to handle all of life's surprises with sophistication and confidence.  This felt good and right for both of them.<br /><br />The story goes so beyond romance and I especially enjoy how Ms. Day ties in murder, sex video's, rock stars and model perfect friends and family into her writing.  She had me enthralled with the vast array of fascinating characters and story lines - this of course, since the beginning of book one.<br /><br />I was not thrilled that it didn't end.  Seems to me that there were many repeat scenes that could have been deleted and the braids then all tied together to bring the trilogy to an end for the readers.  This was disappointing.<br /><br />But overall - SUPER GREAT story!  Thank you Sylvia Day for sharing Eva and Gideon with us!
B00280LYHS|5.0|A really really really good book! The ending is awesome, and the storyline is riveting. It's extremely hard to put down this book! I recommend this to everyone.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I could not stop reading! Once I got all the names straight I plowed right thru. Thanks for a good book!

B00479SVBU|3.0|The menu is good after you hardly figure our how to use it. Is not so good with stations because is easy let's a radio frequency to interrupt the signal from the transmitter, even is you use a free frequency.
B00EY8BRGU|2.0|If you change the actors to those who played in Oceans 11-13, then change the title, change the plot somewhat then it would resemble a sequel from the Oceans franchise but with a downgrade.  The plot is a bit more of a just-write-the-story-as-we-go-along type.  The twist were all cliches.  If they would have left some of those twist out, it would have been refreshing.  The acting was mediocre.  Some of their explanation of how they did those tricks were interesting.  But otherwise the storyline was sort of flat.
B008469DGY|5.0|This is a fun little game. Can be challenging to get the right angles on the shots. But over all a lot of fun.
1475143389|5.0|I NEVER EVER WRITE A REVIEW ON AMAZON because I'm extremely lazy but I had to change that after reading Mike's book. This guy literally lays out the blue print from how to get big and shredded. I read the whole book from start to finish and started following his training and dieting plan right away. I am in week three and I am already leaner, stronger and more muscular. I'm also spending far less time in the gym with his plan. I definitely recommend this book if you're looking to really make a change.<br /><br />ADDED BONUS - The author very kindly answers questions you have if you e-mail him. I e-mailed him and got a response in less than 24 hours!

0399226907|5.0|Many have said what I'm about to say, but there's a few that disagree so I figured I'd throw my 2 cents in... just in case someone stumbles over my review. I BOUGHT THE BOARD BOOK, NOT HARDCOVER!<br /><br />To start, I bought this book for admittedly odd reasons. My daughter is a \\"pig,\\" she is about to have a butterfly party and I needed about $4 more to get free shipping. I knew of this classic, but didn't remember it.<br /><br />SIZE/STYLE: It isn't a bad size at all!? It says 5x7 and I didn't measure it, but I think that's about what it is. Micro? Smaller than a dollar bill? No, but those reviews I saw were from 2009 on the hard cover version which is more money. So if it really was that small, yeah, rip-off! This one is just right for little hands and I actually prefer to buy board books because I don't like ripped pages!<br /><br />STORY: I was very impressed with the learning of the book. Counting, days of the week, and what the caterpillar should be eating!<br /><br />BOOK: I loved the little tabs in the book to bring the kids into it, and the holes in the pages like the caterpillar ate it!<br /><br />Very happy with this purchase. Just over $5 for a classic book that had neat features for young kids!
B0036EH3U2|5.0|LUV LUV LUV BSG!  It's so much fun being able to watch the series from the beginning again.  I highly recommend this set.  The extra content is great as well.
0307887448|5.0|The best sci fi stories, be they books, movies, or video games, create whole worlds which are both exotic and strangely familiar.  What drew me into movies like the Star Wars, Star Trek and Back To The Future series as a kid (and young teen) growing up in the 80s was the excitement of being able to imagine, to explore new possibilities, yet to also see universal truths which applied to my own world.  Ready Player One picks up on that same thread and pulls from familiar archetypes to create a \\"hero's journey\\" in a dystopian future Earth where virtual reality has become the only escape from the harshness of everyday life.  What's brilliant about this book is its self-referential nature, building the foundations of the plot upon a deep understanding of 80s geek culture.  This ingenious plot device allows much of the story to take place in settings and environments which pull from childhood memories of 80s kids like myself, making them richly nostalgic and evocative.  Reading this book brought me back to those amazing memories and has inspired me to dig out some of my favorite old movies, comics and music from that time.  However, the plot itself is exciting enough to appeal to people who may not be aware of many of the references included in this book.  I could imagine not knowing much of anything about the 80s and still enjoying the story for what it is - a fast-paced high-stakes adventure with danger at every turn.<br /><br />The book's only significant flaw for me is the writing style.  I love being inside the narrator's head, but found that the lengthy passages of exposition used to describe major plot points dulled some of the action.  As an amateur writer I've tried to stick to the principle of \\"show me don't tell me\\" (yes I am aware that this is a Rush lyric) and I think this book could have benefited from a bit more of that.  It creates more suspense, more real tension and drama.  However, the plot here is so good that I understand the author's desire to explain this immensely creative world he has created.<br /><br />So in short, I can't recommend this one enough.  It's great to see something new and creative being done in the sci fi realm, and the story really holds together well.  I am eagerly awaiting the next novel!n this immensely creative world he has created.<br /><br />So in short, I can't recommend this one enough.  It's great to see something new and creative being done in the sci fi realm, and the story really holds together well.  I am eagerly awaiting the next novel!

140006922X|5.0|If you don't think Jesus was Jewish, this book is not for you. For the rest of us, this well-researched recounting of the early Christian faith contains a bounty of insights concerning historical events that you thought you knew, but really didn't. Aslan presents the documented facts in a logical way, making sense of the sanitized, curious story we grew up with.

B009LRE040|5.0|Let me start off by saying that I am a die-hard Batman fan. I have been since the animated series blew my mind into a million pieces of awesome. I've also read comics, watched all of the animated movies featuring Batman, so to sum it all up for you, I know my Batman. This entire series was perfect. Executed like a swordsman. This last installment was not on par with the other two in my opinion in terms of combat choreography, but that is the only downfall to this movie. The story, actors and characters in this movie were spectacular! A easy ten out of ten for me. In this movie, you see a Batman that isn't as sharp as he use to be. You can tell in the way he fights that he is sloppy, sluggish and worn down but as always, Batman's never say die determination makes him surpass most brawlers, even in the expert level. Also Batman faces Bane, someone who is by far physically superior (but let me note that if Batman was in his prime, he would have beaten Bane easily) yet Batman through will and determination beat a terrorist with the skill and power to break him. Such intensity and obvious difference in this match-up made this movie so intense. To me it illustrates the struggle of life. Not just this movie, but the version of Batman that Chris Nolan brought to cinema. This movie series is about a man who says \\" I will make a difference in this world, and nothing will stop me.\\" Something we all should inspire to do. A perfect trilogy.

B005BY3XHC|5.0|THis was one the the most succinct and powerful books I have ever read on Success.

My goal was to take some of the key elements in Deepak's 7 Laws and put a less \\"new-age-quantum-physics emphasis and stick with a much more secular and pragmatic approach to this idea.<br /><br />With the Exception of Cause and Effect I use different laws and I use my life's work as a community planner to anchor my 7 Principles.

I also like movies to be free of a lot of gratuitous sex or pointless sexualization of characters.  Surprisingly, both of us found this movie to our liking.  Nothing too bad in here and the story was interesting enough to keep both of our attentions...some violence for him and some intrigue/connection between characters for me....I'd recommend it.

0515153656|3.0|'Killing Floor' was my first Lee Child/Jack Reacher novel.  I have heard a lot about this series, but had never happened to read one until now.<br /><br />This is really quite a good story.  Jack Reacher is an ex Army cop who got out of the military and became a drifter.  While going through a small, corrupt southern town, he is charged with a murder he did not commit.  Needless to say, he decides he is going to find out what really happened.  There is a lot of good action and I enjoyed it a lot.<br /><br />There are some technical problems with this story.  The author apparently knows little about firearms and neither does his editor.  He talks about a .22 gauge weapon.  There is no such thing.  A .22 is a caliber, not a shotgun gauge.  Also, a military policeman is not a super soldier like a Ranger or Green Beret, but Reacher is portrayed more like one of  the latter.  Although these hurt the credibility  of the story, it is still a worthwhile novel.<br /><br />I will likely read more in this series.  I can only hope that the author has done better research and has a better editor for the rest of the series.
0446310786|2.0|I may not be very appreciative of this book (i guess) but i didn't care for it at all! I was constantly waiting for more…
0385345054|5.0|I pre-ordered this book a while ago because I had previously seen flowers made by the authors. I was extremely excited when I opened my package and saw this book inside. There are SO many amazing flowers in this book and I can hardly wait to get started making some of them. Every page that I turned to was incredible. The flowers pictured are like a present for your eyes. That is how special this book is. I literally have hundreds of craft books but this book will be one of my favorites for many years to come. There are so many different flowers to make in this book and so many ways in which to use them.  Rebecca is an extremely gifted artist and she breaks every flower down so that anyone can duplicate the flowers that are made in this book. I really think this book is like a Bible for crepe paper flowers. It is so through and complete and the book is also laid out exceptionally well. There are patterns in the back of the book for the different petals and leaves that are used. There is a layout of the different crepe papers used and even vintage books about crepe paper flowers!!! There is another layout that shows the different scissors and tools used. Another layout features  markers, crayons, stickers, paint, glitter, and flower stamens. Every different technique is broken down step by step. Paper to Petal is as close to perfection as any book could possibly be.<br />In the back of the book Rebecca has listed so many different sources in which to buy the supplies. Many of the sources I had never heard of and they will be such a great reference to have. I love that Rebecca and Patrick have included several companies that sell the different crepe papers with different budgets in mind.<br /><br />I am giving a baby shower to a mother expecting twins and I am going to use several of the flowers and leaves in this book to make a sort of jungle like arrangement on one of my walls. I know that with this book by my side I will be able to create a fabulous arrangements.

1592332803|5.0|This book is amazing for anyone that wants to become vegan. All the ingredients are easy to find in the store. The recipes are easy to follow and delicious.
B00873GRU4|5.0|Wool is one of the rare books that takes on a very high-concept setting and plot, but tells the story simply. The focus is very much on strong characterization, and several characters are drawn and shaded so swiftly you wouldn't believe they winked out within a few pages (yes, the body count is high in this one. GRRM would be proud). The writing is lucid and evocative; I thought the tragic moments (and there are a few) were particularly well done.<br /><br />This book (for me) does what most popular scifi these days fails to - it tries to be, and is, a book, not a movie (looking at you, Hunger Games) and it remains consistent in tone such that you don't question the world-building while you read it. It pulls you in, and makes you gape in wonder at the creativity behind it.<br /><br />Unfortunately so much of my delight in reading this book came from the frequent and completely unexpected twists the tale took, that I cannot say any more about the plot (besides what the blurb does) at the risk of spoiling the experience for another person. Suffice it to say, you will squeal in delight, and frequently be aghast. Loads of &#34;Ahas&#34; and &#34;gotchas&#34;.<br /><br />I will also say this is a dystopian setting to rival what's in the Matrix movies. In fact the end of this omnibus (Wool was written as five short stories/ episodes - which aren't all standalone reads) felt to me very much like the climax of the first Matrix, with Neo flying out of the phone booth. So much potential ground to break for the author in the sequel, &#34;Shift&#34;, and the conclusion, &#34;Dust&#34;.
1444777556|5.0|I loved this book as much as the first one James wrote. I felt as I was reading it that James was talking to me personally. He's very honest in his writing and very transparent. I could feel what I thought he was feeling at the time which to me makes it a page turner.
B009P3N1GI|5.0|No wonder it won the Hugo for best novella!<br /><br />This little book from Brandon Sanderson has all the components one has come to expect from him; compelling characterization, a mind bending magic system, and a fast unfolding plot. I'm impressed at how much story-telling and world-building he's fit into just a hundred pages.<br /><br />Continuing Sanderson's trend of all his work being part of the same uber universe, I was delighted to learn this is set on the same planet as Elantris, though it can be read as a standalone. a must-read for fans of Sanderson, and a great, short introduction to him for newcomers!
B002QW7AJY|5.0|If you panic in small spaces this is not for you. This movie has a way of putting you in a believable setting.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|What a brilliant book! This is vintage Gaiman, an adult tale with a child protagonist; a fistful of the fantastic, a pinch of macabre... It's a short and compelling novel that reads like a novella and was for me simply not put-downable. If I had to use one adjective to describe it, I'd call it 'evocative': of childhood, of the sense of wonder that can put two moons in a sky in your mind's eye, and turn a pond into an ocean!<br /><br />I recently listened to the Audible version of Neil Gaiman's earlier opus, The Graveyard Book, and it was a funny experience to read this one after - a little version of Mr Gaiman seems to have installed himself in my head and read this book aloud to me. This is a must-read if there ever was one!
B000OLTMQ8|5.0|love this movie. Sylvester Stallone is a self made man. He is rocky, because what he had to do in his personal life to get the first film made and I think this reflects it.<br /><br />You don't have to like it, but I love this after reading about his life. Plus his talk with his son is one probably one of the best thing a parent can tell a child. &#34;...coward and you're not like that!&#34;
B005FVNIW6|4.0|I loved this book, and I can understand why it won the acclaim and awards that it did. A military tale, starring kids and told with great empathy, involving battles and bullying and space-ships and a virtual world, ending on space operatic notes? What's not to like? :-) This really is science fiction at its entertaining best, the final twist and d&eacute;nouement are compelling and I didn't see them coming. That said I'm on the fence about whether I should read the rest of the series.<br /><br />Does this series suffer from the Dune syndrome of excellent first book and downhill from there, I wonder?<br /><br />Hopefully the movie that comes out later this year does the book justice. Oh, and I didn't detect any anti-gay tones in this first book although I take it the author and the rest of the series are what are the issue with reference to the controversy surrounding the movie.<br /><br />PS: I couldn't help but notice the similarities between the buggers from this book and Robert Heinlein's Arachnids from Starship Troopers (I've only seen the movie).
B00BUT5I84|5.0|Great music. Bought it because of loving of 30stm. Worth it. Really like it. Hope it can do better music in the future.
B00513DGIO|5.0|A provocative book that questions the very foundations of Capitalism and Debt. In many ways the author is staking out a position that is antipodal to [[ASIN:0143116177 The Ascent of Money: A Financial History of the World]] as he asks a simple question: \\"Why is it moral to always pay one's debts?\\"<br /><br />He then proceeds to link the answer to that question through human history, starting with early civilizations, through the demise of the Gold standard in 1971, to the financial crisis also known as the 'Great Recession'.<br /><br />Unlike most provocative books this is not a prescriptive one except at the very end where the author rather convincingly recommends a general debt amnesty.<br /><br />My only complaint is that he skips forward rather brusquely in his account of human history from the birth of European Imperialism and the French Revolution rather abruptly to Nixon in '71. I should've liked a cogent description of the intervening period in support of the proposed theory. I also didn't appreciate how despite initially taking a multi-threaded approach to recounting history (Latin America, Europe, India, China) he switched at the end to an almost exclusively European/ American account of the 20th century. As it stands though, these are minor quibbles.<br /><br />I must say I'm still digesting all the implications of this book, and will need to read further and wider if I am to form a proper opinion on this. For now though, consider me fascinated. Heartily recommend this to anyone!
B00DYVU9K8|3.0|\\"Let's Go Shopping.\\" This is a true story based of a group of teenagers in California who became obsessed with celebrity and fashion. After Rebecca (Chang) breaks into an empty house and takes clothes and purses she ups the ante. When she hears that Paris Hilton is out of town she talks her friend into \\"shopping\\" her house with her. When her friends hear about this they want in as well and soon no celebrity is safe from the thieving kids known as The Bling Ring. Going in I wasn't really looking forward to this because it didn't seem like my type of movie. Being a 34 year old man a movie about 20-somethng girls stealing famous peoples jewelry didn't sound that exciting to me. I do have to admit that this was much much better then I was expecting. I do remember hearing about this a little when it was going on which helped my enjoyment a little. The thing that really kept me from getting too involved is I didn't like the kids who were stealing but it was hard to see Paris Hilton, Audrina Patridge, Orlando Bloom, Rachel Bilson and Lindsay Lohan as victims. Overall, the movie wasn't really that bad but again I'm not the target audience. I give it a B.
B00BBA6FOI|3.0|I'm not the best person to review this book. First of all, I despise self-help books, and never read any if I can help it, especially when so labeled. Secondly, I treat contemporary bestsellers, especially mass market bestsellers, with contempt; they deserve it so often that it's become my default stance on them. Next, I have little patience for movements and associated literature, being fundamentally suspicious of conviction and passion-fueled rhetoric (as opposed to rationality), which is alas, the only thing that does (or can?!) fuel movements. Finally, I detest books that pretend to be research theses and cram in footnotes.<br /><br />This book, if you hadn't heard, is a bestselling, self-help piece that hopes to become a movement, and 40% of its slim being is footnotes. Yeah, we were never gonna get along :-) I would never have bought or read it if my wife, sister, and mum weren't all raving about it.<br /><br />I did read it in full though, with effort, and despite Sheryl Sandberg's COO tendency to cram more factoids and statistics into the book than a Manorama Yearbook, or the irritating rat-a-tat frequency at which she drops names, or the inexplicable urgency she shows in keeping every interesting anecdote shorter than five sentences. (Hiring opportunity for Twitter if ever there was one!). She's also spent far too much time addressing potential detractors and heading off counter arguments in the beginning of the book - at the cost of making said argument - for my taste. That this was a slim book made it no less a slog.<br /><br />Her message is impeccable however, and timely, and a great way to use her celebrity bully pulpit. To her credit the clouds do part, and her writing shines in places - like in Chapter 10 (of 11), once she stops writing a stat supported, slightly insecure thesis and makes a passionate argument. But that's enough literature snobbery from me. The problem perhaps is that she writes like this were a TED talk; it isn't.<br /><br />On the content then... I'm a conscious egalitarian and only a mild, mostly subconscious chauvinist (I hope) and I'm proud to work for an employer that values and promotes diversity. Unquestionably, the world would be a better place if it were 'more equal'. This book helped me identify a few more of my blind spots, and made me think about how I can be more sensitive to the issues women face in the workplace - or even (gasp!) make a difference!<br /><br />Ultimately, I was agreeing with the author on the issue, but left wanting a better written book. Kudos to Ms Sandberg for writing it, and it is a useful, recommended read. It's clearly a book of and for our times... but let's just say it is not the book we deserved - only a book we need!

B00AZMFK3K|4.0|\\"Space, the final frontier...\\" After saving Spock (Quinto) but disobeying orders Captain Kirk (Pine) is demoted. When a former member of Star Fleet, John Harrison, attacks headquarters and a close friend of Kirk's winds up dead he is chosen to lead a crew to find Harrison. When it turns out that he is hiding on a Klingon planet the crew must deal with the fact that they will be entering a hostile environment and their presence may be enough to start a war, but like all things, things aren't always what they seem to be. I have never really been a Star Trek fan. I did however really really like the first movie that this crew did a few years ago and was looking forward to this one. This movie is a rare example of a sequel being better then the first one. There isn't really much else to say about this since it does have a built in fan base but for a non-trekkie I really really enjoyed this and I recommend this. Overall, I think this is the best film of the franchise. I give it an A-.
B006WAIV6M|4.0|Highly recommended reading! This is a useful book, well researched and an enjoyable read to boot. The revelations it dishes regarding the role of habits in our lives were mundane in hindsight, but surprising (if not shocking) when I read them. The three component model of habit description (cue, routine, reward) as well as anecdotes on how habits might change were a great sensible input. I thought the book was weakest near the end when it tried to apply habit theory to entire societies, and to my chagrin (in the afterword) when it finally gave in fully to its urge to be a self help book...<br /><br />That said... it was a rewarding read. It's all very well to say things like 'habits make character' or that 'we are all creatures of habit' but this book powerfully illustrated the pervasive nature of habits to me. Personally speaking it got me thinking about how many hours of a day I spend on 'auto pilot' and grow aghast at the answer.<br /><br />This was a lot like my last read - 'Quiet' by Susan Cain, which also visited the story of Rosa Parks and Rick Warren's Saddleback Church, and concerned itself with the role the older, more primitive parts of our brain play in or lives.<br /><br />In fact, there were so many connections to other books, TED talks, videos and articles on the web that have gone viral, and so on that I'm beginning to suspect there's a wider trend in contemporary, popular, non-fiction, self-help/ behavioural science literature fueled by advances in neuroscience. Hmm..
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is so addictive! At first it seems a little boring, but no it's definitely not! I can play it for hours at a time!
B0074YVW1G|5.0|This is an important book, and a very well written one. Susan Cain is as eloquent, empathetic, wise, and engaging an author as she is a speaker (based on her appearance at TED, and some RSA 'Big Think' videos, which impressed, and were what made my wife read and then recommend this book to me).<br /><br />I've always flipped between an introvert and an extrovert in my personality type test results, the handful of times that I've given an Enneagram or, more pertinently, a Myers Briggs test - where I come out as 51-49% of one or the other. As a reflective/ introspective person, I've often found myself wondering which one I was more of! This book might've settled the question - I may well be an 'ambivert'!<br /><br />The book affords insights for individuals, as for friends, colleagues, spouses, partners, teachers, parents, and all the many roles in which we interact with each other - especially if you, or your counterparts in these relationships are introverts. I say insights and not advice (which is present as well) because this reads like - is - a scholarly study, or a book of behavioral science, in the tradition of Desmond Morris, rather than a self help book in the tradition of Dale Carnegie (who it gently reprimands for creating the 'extrovert ideal'.)<br /><br />That it comes across as readable, even enjoyable, and not dry or preachy is testament to Ms. Cain's excellent writing. A must read, and one of the best books I've read this year (and one I feel compelled to blog about in a more personal voice some time when it's not 5 am and I don't have a full day of work ahead)

1594203334|5.0|Personally, I loved this book.  I got the Kindle and the &#34;WhisperAudio&#34; which was read by a fantastic actress, making this actually a joy.  There is a lot of wit, fun as well as dry humour in here.  The author is easy to relate to.  I highly recommend the audio format.<br /><br />This book equally describes the French attitude, shows examples of the differences between this and the *predominant* American practice that she sees, describes her own awkward experiences with early parenthood & later victories, and provides solid research.  She's a pro writer.  And she reminds us that this book and any like it are generalizations, not every French or American family will be the same, so please don't bore us with offended reviews that you're not perfectly described, as you defend your parenting style. I'm so glad I took a chance on this despite these types of protest reviews.<br /><br />One reviewer complains of her Chapter 1 where she describes some background on her marriage, but, I am a sucker for these stories and it was brief.  If the relationship isn't a good foundation for the story of the kids, what is?  And it was nice to get to know her husband's character arc along with her kids' and her own.<br /><br />Overall, I can say I feel very much informed and entertained.  A week ago, I felt neither, just a little panicked, not knowing what to expect.  I was a future helicopter-parent.  Now I'm a future parent, feeling I've some good knowledge and tools and a more healthy (not stressed), relaxed attitude toward the next 9 months and beyond.  I also thought it was generous of her to mention certain doctors and books as resources.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I thought this book was among the best I've ever read.  The characters are very well developed.  You know who they are and how they think.  The story is so real it breaks your heart.  I don't think we realize what a person feels who loses entire mobility and the ability to function without assistance in every aspect of life.  This injury affects everyone around the patient deeply and changes all of their lives.  I particularly enjoyed the vulnerability of the characters, and I understood them.  I would recommend the book without hesitation and have ordered another by the same author..
B000069KIZ|5.0|I have owned #2 before on vinyl, and used to have a #1 with Bohm and the Berliners from the 60s.  All in all - what you have here is truly a piece of history. The wonderful liner notes, written by a scholar and retired violinist with the Wiener Philharmoniker, details the history of the deep and direct connection between Brahms himself and the VPO.  No other orchestra has this direct tradition.  Bohm is most definitely then, a custodian of this great legacy.<br /><br />So does that mean the performances or recordings are boring and academic?  Hardly!  Beautifully recorded, capturing all the ravishing acoustic of the Musikverein in Vienna (where Brahms himself heard his symphonies premiered)and with playing that is so musical and elegant, this set is a treasure.  The tempos are not break neck, but the rhythmic pulse and energy are so clean and lilting!!!  Bohm was known for very minimal conducting motions, but there is no lack of fire or energy here.  At this bargain price, and very nicely remastered sound, one cannot go wrong getting this set.  If you love Brahms and this venerable \\"instrument of Brahms\\" (the VPO)  you must have this.  I am so grateful to DG for releasing this set.  It is now my fourth Brahms cycle (obsessed?  you bet): Bernstein (erratic and bad sound),  Levine on DG - good in many ways, Von Karajan from the early 60s with Berlin, and this.  I will soon add the Giulini cycle.<br /><br />Buy, listen, and hear the love these men pour into this music.

1401238580|5.0|I've recently got into graphic novels, rated it 5 stars for the book. If you don't have the book yet, this version is a good buy. I bought mine for $16 thats about 2 dollars regular edition.. Mask quality is okay, for what you pay for. The only thing that I didn't like was the packaging, it is prone to damages during shipping, Mine arrived banged up and there was a tear on one of the edges.

159562015X|5.0|My boss bought this for me as a self assessment, something he tried previously and enjoyed enough to pass it along. I felt that it was very accurate and was a great way to see what I bring to the table that he does not (i.e. where he is weak, I am strong and vice versa). Even though many organizations play to the traditional hierarchy model, I strongly suggest evaluating the option of treating your organization as a team. Where bosses come to assistants for input, problems are worked through with solution oriented brainstorming sessions, etc. This method coupled with utilizing this book to help put together a team where each person brings a particular strength should make for an effective organization.

B00E9O6C96|5.0|Introduction:  FiiO has been a very popular brand in affordable headphone audio accessories for the past few years. Their line out docks, amplifiers, DAC's, and plenty of other gadgets have redefined what you can get for your money. FiiO has now launched their first DAP, the X3. This player has been in the works for many years now. It was plagued when it started and went on hiatus until 2012 when it was brought back to life. Now in 2013, The X3 is finally here, and many think it will redefine what a $200 DAP can do. It packs physical and software features that fans want at a good price. I wish to thank FiiO for this review sample, now let's take a look at this audacious unit.  Notice: This review was originally posted on Head-Fi, and I am the original author of that review. This is just a repost to Amazon for visibility and to help people make an educated descision.    Build Quality:  The FiiO X3 was designed before the E17, so its build is a bit dated in terms of how it looks compared to FiiO's new sleek and stealthy units. But for the most part, it still retains a lot of FiiO's qualities. Where it keeps the metal back and combination of plastics and metals. The back of the X3 looks like something current, while the front shows its dated approach. It looks like the back-plate that keeps the current design was added in just for that purpose. The metal on the sides leading up to the backplate is different from the backplate itself. From the sides up, there is a bezel circling the unit. This bezel is plastic, and finally we get to the flat top of the device. Where the top portion is the plastic covering the screen, and the bottom is the (current gen) metal design. Within the metal are 6 buttons and `skidding' strips with plastic bases for the volume and movement keys.    Now that the design of the X3 is out of the way, let's move on to the  bad qualities of it first. The actual quality of the material used on the X3 is a bit disappointing compared to what is used on other FiiO devices, but is a granted. Whereas the E12 and E07K feature pretty hunky metals on them, the X3's back and side plates feel very thin. Squeezing it a bit hard on the sides and back shows a slight flex of the metal. There is also a notable squeak noise when pressing the unit down showing the looser tolerances in the device. The bezel is also easily chipped and damaged. A slight scuff put a notable but very small chip in it. So be wary of dropping it, although the loose tolerances, and body may protect it. It will come out looking uglier than before.    These are a bit disheartening, but are also understandable. The X3 is a DAP with a big battery, amplifier, DAC and all these parts in it. It has to be light enough so users don't complain about it being a brick while still being heavy enough. The cost of the battery, materials used in it, and R&D put a probable big cost on the X3. So using airplane grade lightweight metal is also going to be out of the question when this thing has a recommended retail of $199.    Ok, I hope you are still with me, so let's move onto the goods. This device is still a FiiO device of course. The plastic is pretty durable and isn't malleable or very bendable. The screen plastics keep it from getting scratches easily whilst the bezel makes it look great without additional use of metal. The utilitarian side design using simple screws around the X3 allow it to be DIY'd in case of battery problems or for any adventurous onlookers out there. If it's easy and it works, then its good is a fine motto to use. Although the side metal is of lower quality than the rest, it offers enough resistance to pushing, scratching, and any other problems that its really a non issue for most unless they plan on doing a drop test. And lastly, the front and back's parallel `current gen' FiiO stealthy and sleek metals are still as good as they are on the others. Hard, smooth and sexy is really the word to use. They offer a great feel as you hold it, and don't have any real issues. The buttons are also quite nice, and much more tactile than I would have thought. There are physical buttons beneath it actually to provide for a better reaction and feel to it.    Overall, the build quality of the X3, fits the device. It's lightweight and of enough quality for a dap of this price. It allows for maneuverability and portability without being hunkered down by a paper weight and without raising costs. The lower tolerances inside it do make for some squeaks if you press it which is a shame.    Accessories:  The FiiO X3 comes with a few accessories for you to use it. It comes with 2 screen protectors, a white case, USB transfer and power cable, Coaxial adapter, and the manuals it gives you. There is no 3.5mm interconnect cable this time around, but in my opinion, its expected that if you have an external amp you wish to use with the X3, you would already have the cable yourself.    The only real fancy accessory is the Coaxial adapter. Basically, one end is a female Digital Coaxial(S/PDIF) plug while the other is a 3.5mm one. The 3.5mm end plugs into the Coaxial Output port on the X3, and the other end receives a regular Digital Coaxial(S/PDIF) cable. This allows your X3 to be the source, and to allow another unit to work as the DAC and then amp.    FiiO's current policy on accessory replacements is that they are free. However there is the cost of shipping which is a flat $5 as they are sending it directly international. This was posted on FB and on HF, and is a program they can end at any time. As of this writing, their program is still in place.    SD Card:  As of the writing of this, the SD card support is up to 64GB Micro SDXC with FAT32 formating, there is only one slot. This works quite well actually, there are no problems with recognizing it. Class 4 and above is recommended by me.  Even the lowest class can at max, read or write at 2MB/s. The usual MP3 is about 10MB whilst the lossless FLAC is about 35MB and the WAV at 50MB.    But of course maximum read or write is generally not achieved with these cards. Class 2 is meant for SD Video recording. Not to mention latency and other things with class 2 differences possibility.    For those doing FLAC's. Class 4 at the least is what seems to be the option to use  [...]  SD Cards are also a bit of luck of the draw with latency and data buffering(how quick it can start up and start moving data) so keep that in mind.    I personally use a 32GB Micro SDHC Class 10 card because its the same price as the other classes      Formating the SD Card: For 64GB Micro SDXC cards, it is recommended to format to FAT32. I have not used it, but SD Formatter 4.0 seems to work and do what needs to be done. 32GB's and other cards are also recommended for FAT32 formating. This should fix most problems with X3 not recognizing your micro SD card. 128GB Micro SDXC is not yet confirmed to work or if it will work. If it keeps the same number of pins as the current SDXC cards, it should work. But that is not a definite.    Usability:  This section will be split into software usability (UI) and physical usability. For the software usability section which will be first, there will be 2 section splits. The first section will give you an overview of how the X3 does things, and the second will be on a opinion basis of what I think/interpret the usability of it. Please note, that it will be very helpful if you watch my How-To-Use video above. This will allow you to follow along and get what I am saying better. It is a long video, but will fill you in on it.    First off, I will just give you the overview of the X3. The FiiO X3's UI is not ultra good looking, but current updates have made it much more appealing to the eye. The first menu includes the settings, EQ access, Browse Files option, Category Options, Favorites, and the Playing option which includes all the folder options. From that layer, I find what are two types of file finding styles in the X3. Automatic and Manual organization.  Automatic Organization is where the X3 takes the id3 (Artist, album, song title, name etc) tag of the song and uses that to auto sort your songs into the play all, artists, genres and albums folders. The X3 basically takes command and does things for you, and sorts stuff. For more info, please watch the video.    Manual Organization is accessed from the front menu, and by going to `Browse Files'. Here, you access your files as you would access your hard drives on a computer. The songs appear as they do from your computer. From here, you can organize your songs how you want. If you like to make custom playlists, or have folders and subfolders in specific ways. You can put and organize folders and files on your computer. They will show up exactly the same way when you access the Browse Files selection. Here, folders will be the names you gave them, and organization is done yourself. I have a custom organization on my SD card, so I frequently use this to quickly find the stuff I want. However keep in mind, that all the songs on your browse files folders are the same ones found in Auto. Auto just takes all the songs from the Browse Files sections(your SD card and internal storage) and auto sorts them. For more info, please watch the video.    Actual Usability thoughts now. So what do I personally think of the X3's UI usability as of FW 1.2? It's ok but not perfect. As long as all your ID3 tags are done correctly, the UI's usability is actually quite good. You go into albums or artists and bam, your stuff is exactly where you want it to be.  But that's not always going to be easy now is it? As of 1.2, ALAC/AAC have problems with their id3 tags showing up. Meaning all your .m4a songs will be stuffed into the Unknown Album and Unknown Artist folders. But this should get fixed in a release soon. Next there is the problem for scrolling. The X3 does support press and hold for its volume and movement keys. But imagine having a lot of albums or artists whichmany of you do. I don't have that many, and its already a pain to move from the very top(by default) to somewhere in the middle. You can go backwards and start from the bottom, but this doesn't really help the problem out that much. Most touch devices today allow you a side bar to quickly move to a letter and bam, you reach it near instantly.  Now, is that it? Well no, the X3 does something very convenient for Asian users. And that is list by Track Title and not name. This means that if your id3 tags are set in such a way(and the mass majority are), the moment you reach an artist or album folder. All the internal songs will have their track numbers. So the first track will still be first, but will now have the number 1 next to it. This doesn't sound like a problem right? It isn't until you have multiple albums under the same artist in the `Categories' folder. Now you see the problem? You will now have alternations of albums. If you have two albums under the same artist, you will have two track number ones at the top(the first tracks of the two numbers) and then they go down alternating the same way. This of course is great for Asian songs that don't use romanticization. But not for you if you are reading my review(which is in English if you haven't realized it yet). (The solution to organizing Artist categories section by Album has been posted by me. Click this hyperlink)This also makes the Play All category impossible to use. Imagine the first song from every single one of the albums you have on your X3 being the first thing you see, followed by all the number two's and so on. I would prefer an alphabetical play all, but thinking back on it, this wouldn't help either as there is no scrolling, finding a song out of thousands by constantly scrolling would be extremely irritating. As of right now, the play all function is practically useless.  Moving on, the X3's system usability besides songs is quite good actually, the player and system settings contain just what you think they contain, and there are shortcuts to adding songs to favorites, viewing their info, and quick access to the EQ controls by pressing and holding the Bookmarks/Back key while in a song. Lack of volume control unless you are in the song as of right now is pretty disappointing though. The volume key also maps to increasing or decreasing other options without entering a sub menu(watch the how to video if you are confused), but it does this for so few things that I think it should still be remapped.  Mr.Panda, Mr.Panda, but what about loading times? Well currently there is still a slight delay when loading some songs, but for the most part, its reaction is fast enough for it not to be a problem for me. Replaying some songs manually can sometimes cut off the first second of the song, but of course, this should be fixed with firmware updates.    But overall, if your id3 tags are correct, the X3's software usability is quite workable. You can either manually make and use those playlists or count on the X3's Categories of genre's, albums, and artists to keep you afloat. Even the mixing due to the track title usage isn't that big of a deal as you already know what song you want already. The X3 is a deadly device if your id3 tags are a mess though, so use this as an opportunity to clean up your library.    Physical Usability: The X3 is of good size, and reaching the buttons and controls is a non issue(unless you are a chipmunk). The volume and movement keys have a indented plastic guide underneath them. Add this into muscle memory, and after the first week of using the X3, I had no problems finding the buttons I want, but before that, expect frustration. I kept miss-hitting keys for the first week, and especially the first day. This is normal of any new device of course. The hold key keeps things nice and off while on the go, and nothing really protrudes annoyingly. The device is light to hold and offers enough build to be cool. But of course, its not always daisies and roses. The brightness is a problem outside. Even using the winter theme and maximum brightness(which offers the best outside usage) the X3 is still hard to see while outside in use. It's not impossible but be prepared. If the X3 is sitting in your pocket while walking, the top headphone jack makes it so that you have to put the X3 into your pocket so that it's actually backwards then how you would normally hold it. This of course is with many devices nowadays but it should be noted. Lastly, is that the micro SD input depth is not fully flush with the outside case meaning that a small bit of the SD card sticks out. It's about a mm if not less of it sticking out, but this could make it so that you can push it by accident making your card drop out.    Overall, the physical usage of the X3 was not a problem for me while I used it. It was quite nice to use and worked with my everyday routine while walking my dog.    Battery Life:  10-12 hours is about what I am getting. This is of course not exact, full brightness is used as well. If there is huge interest in getting an exact number, I may do a full day test. But for now, what is on paper is pretty accurate. FiiO recommends using a power bank on the go.    Driving Power:  This drives the AKG Q701's with no problems(high gain), and can drive even my more sensitive IEM's without problems as well due to the 60 steps of volume control and using low gain.    Line out and Coaxial Out:  Both work very well. Line out and heapdhone out can actually work and output at the exact same time, this allowed me to do the A/B testing below. However, Coaxial out does have priority over the both of them if the plug is inputted there. I did not detect any sonic problems when testing this feature out.    Testing:  The FiiO X3 was used in conjunction with my Project-H unit, FiiO HS2, FiiO E12, Miu Audio MRB. And plugged into AKG Q701 and RHA SA950i for the purpose of this review.    Highs:  The high frequency response of the X3 is for the most part smooth, but is a bit more subdued than normal. The high ranges aren't as bright and have a bit less shine to them. This is a favorable quality on the go, but as this is an audiophile DAP, its up to the user to decide if they like it or not. As there is less of a shine, this allows for more on the go comfort and lack of fatigue while listening.    Mids:  The mids are a bit more thin on the X3, they have good detail, but the more strainy/whiny sound they produce is less than desirable. This can add a bit of fatigue to the user, but the amount they are off by is not much. They have a slight upper mid spike of brightness at the very top of the range, but below that, the spike isn't really there, and features a bit more subduing in the mid range.    Vocals:  The vocals on the X3 are a bit more elevated than normal, this allows the singers to appear more out there. The instruments then take a backwards role with the X3 rather than them both being balanced. This to me is quite favorable as it makes your favorite singers more in the center than compared to the instruments.    Lows:  The FiiO X3 features a prominent bass region, especially the mid bass which is bumped up a bit. With bassy songs and already bassy headphones, I've felt a need to EQ down the bass a bit at some times(a rare for me). But of course, the slight bump in mid bass prominence isn't to be taken as an overly big one, its just a sonic feature of the X3. The extension of the X3 has no visible problems.    Popular Comparisons:  These use the FiiO X3's line out so that the DAC remains the same while only the amp sections changes.  FiiO E12 - FiiO X3  First of all, the FiiO E12 boasts better transparency in the sense that it sounds more natural than the X3. This is in part due to the mid subduing the X3 does to the instruments. This allows for the E12's mid range to come off as more forward and apparent than the X3's. The background of the E12 is also much better than the X3's. The background of the E12 is much more cleaner. I mean by this that there is more noise and closeness of instruments in the `background' with the X3 than the E12. The E12's also offer a vocal range that is brought back down, this makes it sound colder(although not the same as neutral), and cleaner than the X3 which makes the vocals more musical. There is also more boom in the bass of the X3 than the E12. Pretty expectable results in my opinion.    FiiO E07K Andes -FiiO X3  The FiiO X3 is the clear winner here, the Vocals in the Andes are about the same with the elevation but are much warmer and actually have a slight less detail and resolution. The warm coloration of the Andes is also even more so than the X3. The entire range of frequencies is also more separate on the X3, where the Andes is more compressed together. The X3 is not only a more neutral amp, but also a more transparent one.    Conclusion:  The FiiO X3 is a winner in my book. It's sound is still bassy and warm like one would expect from FiiO, but its not exactly a slouch either. It may have those qualities, but it is on the upper scale in how it reproduces sound by being quite accurate sounding. The UI is actually in working condition and will work with your life very well, granted your id3 tags are done correctly and in place. It is lightweight, and has the features that audiophiles have been asking for, for a while now. The Micro SD capabilities work very well in terms of me being able to manually organize my folders, and internal storage of 8GB's is quite nice for a starters DAP. I would have liked a better build, but this is a dated design and needs to be lightweight. At $199, its a very good new DAP to the market.
1781162646|4.0|The book was all around pleasantly surprising. I bought it on a whim since it was only $7 for a plane ride and finished it while I was still on vacation.<br /><br />The murderer/ghost story almost feels like an after thought to the story which didn't even bother me because I cared so much about the characters. It also helps by making the big reveal of the killer surprising and when the story line goes to dealing with the murder, it feels organic and not forced. I was surprised how much I enjoyed the book. It is a great coming of age story first and a ghost story second.

B0036EH3U2|5.0|Great addition for our collection of quality SiFi genre. This will give you many hours of quality entertainment on those cold winter nights!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It is so much fun. I could play it all day if I could! So glad I got this game.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Easy to program the desire time's, simple, simple, simple.  Work's without WIFI. Give it a try you might be pleasantly surprised of how easy it is to work.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|Very fun game I have been playing all night long hope I find so diamonds soon because I really don't want to buy any at all
B007SGM084|5.0|A very different love story. Loved every minute of reading it! It keeps you on your toes and interested. You get completely involved, lost in the book!
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I've found it clear and accurate, still reading it, doing the experiments.  When I don't succed, I try it again.  Also the Webster dictionary is extremely useful.<br />Thanks
B00BNGFGIQ|3.0|Thought this was a pretty good game, but I was finding myself getting frustrated and decided that I wasn't going to put myself through it and deleted it.  I am sure that someone else that is younger than I would enjoy this!
B005G4TJI4|5.0|They arrived on time! I loved the movie...nothing better than blu ray 100% recommended...great price, I just hope there is one sequel coming..
B00B4804KS|5.0|Loved the original, and 3D just makes it that much better. It was a brand new adventure for the adults as well as the children. A lot of 3D remakes don't cut it, but this one makes the grade without a doubt. Nice job.
B004LROUNG|4.0|Thrilling to the very end.  Could not put it down for the last 100 pages terrific read and truly enjoyable
1878424319|5.0|Great book!  However, I'd recommend the Fifth Agreement as it covers everything in this book and a little more. Thanks
B00D41AJ7G|3.0|I found this game entertaining, for a little while.  The game introduces a new puzzle element every level or so, but the rest of the game structure is to reproduce the puzzle elements learned in previous levels.  I found this style of play tedious and not very challenging.  Given the otherwise apparently broad appeal of this game, I suspect that this play style is simply not for me.  The game itself is well-made, has a style all its own, and seems to have been a labor of love.<br /><br />I'm a spatial thinker and a programmer myself, so the construction and execution of procedures in this game is perhaps too close to work for me to enjoy it as a game.
B00DDXJRJG|5.0|If you ever wished you could tweak your sound, then this your app. Not only did it work for winamp, but it also let me boost the volume beyond what my android will normally allow.<br /><br />Hard of hearing? Now you can boost the volume to where you can hear whispers during a movie. Cant hear the music? No problem.<br /><br />For anyone who sees pro versions which cost a little extra money but give you a EQ or sound adjustment, get this instead.
B006ZB3V2C|4.0|When at home, I'm accustomed to running a box fan at night for white noise.  Recently, when traveling, I had trouble staying asleep through someone's intermittent snoring.  After a few minutes of tweaking the settings in this app, I found some &#34;ceiling fan&#34; and other white noise settings that let me sleep through the rest of the night.  Note that having the right in-ear headphones was key.<br /><br />I think some of the settings in this app could be very atmospheric, although maybe less suited for sleeping -- the piercing howl of a wolf, for example.  This and the complexity involved in changing from one &#34;theme&#34; to another led me to dock a star.
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|This lapel mic works better than expected, and I always use the battery powered mic, versus using phantom power. It performs wonderfully, and I would whole-heartedly recommend this product to others wishing for a lapel microphone. 20 foot long cord, with option to connect a longer cord to it, for greater distance and freedom from the subject being recorded!
B00DDZM0GQ|5.0|I was initially skeptical of this game.  The &#34;-tris/-dris&#34; suffix led me to believe that this would be another Tetris clone.  In reality, although blocks do fall, and the goal is to clear lines, the primary game mechanic is to slide blocks back and forth in the playing field.  There are several game modes, but excluding Survival Mode, blocks fall into the playing field after each of your moves.  Thus, the game allows you to stop and consider each move, if you wish.  I have enjoyed this game for several hours, so far, and I'm looking forward to playing more of it.
B001QWBM62|5.0|I have this as an added feature to recording musical acts as part of my video/stills business. I performs great atop my camera, or even mounted on the side, depending on the room and its source to record. Easy to see controls and viewing is good until the display turns off, which helps to control the battery drain, but make for poor adjustments, too. Easy to use and figure out, sturdy and reliable. I use this as a directional mic, either at a 90 or 120 degree area to record. I also use the H2n on stage for an ambient sound, and mix all 7 tracks in my audio editor for an outstanding sound on my videos!
B00AKO93JK|5.0|The apps produced by this developer have kept me on an exercise regimen for the last 10 months.  No stopwatches or staring at the clock; I just do the exercises (after a short learning curve) while watching TV or listening to music, and the app lets me know when I'm done.<br /><br />As a sedentary office worker, I have chosen to focus on the ab exercises, as they have been very good for keeping my back strong and my stomach toned.<br /><br />Feeling great and looking forward to the next year.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|I loved the story of this soldier who goes to combat for our country watching his team die with himself badly injured, not knowing if he'll ever return home and still has faith in our Lord.<br /><br />This book portrays what really is going on in  our wars today, what our soldiers are up against.
B00CO4KGYA|3.0|The physics-based knockout of your enemies is a lot like Angry Birds, but you serve a tennis ball that ricochets off obstacles and walls.  Good for passing a few minutes, but it's not so ingenious or entertaining that it's worth purchasing.
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|I love how its only 99 cents or 99 coins but it looks like a game that you would get for ps3 or xbox soooooooooo worth it
B00BGZ8TVA|5.0|this movie really makes you think about the story line, funny and interesting fir the whole family or friends at home
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Just got this in yesterday and I was surprised at how brief the instructions were, it actually worried me a bit. Turns out there was no need to worry, you basically plug it in, download the app and hit OK. It was literally that easy. The only downside is that there aren't many apps that support it yet, but I'm sure it won't take long before everyone adds a Chromecast button. I'm playing Netflix on a TV now that doesn't even have a cable connection, so smooth, all technology should be this easy.
B00CATONCA|5.0|I love it!!! This box set is so awesome I am so glade I bought this. A+++ great details on the heads. so cool.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|very entertaining and a good game to keep you busy, and teaches you how much work goes into it makes you appreciate farmers and ranchers
B0044C5SCU|5.0|This is by far one of the best shows I have seen in a while, wish it didn't end, hope they bring it back!
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|This game is great!!!  The only problem is that it is very addictive.  I lose track of time when I play sometimes.
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|I am now almost 60 years old, and I think my mom took my younger sisters and me to see this film at the theater perhaps a dozen times. Over the years, we have seen it on television and on VHS, so I jumped at the opportunity to get the 45th Anniversary Edition on Blu-Ray for such a low price when it was advertised on sale. When the package arrived, I was very surprised to find that the package was so heavy. Among other things, the package included a ceramic music box that I could add to my collection of music boxes. When my husband and I watched the Blu-Ray, I found I still knew the whole movie word for word, but that did not lessen my enjoyment. This time, I saw it on a big screen HDTV without commercials, and with closed captioning. I actually did get one or two words I had never understood before.<br /><br />The best thing for me, however, was that I was able to send another package to the home of my sister who is caring for my dying mom. We are trying to provide some of my mom's \\"Favorite Things\\" in her last days. I send flowers every few weeks, and last month I also sent her favorite gourmet ice cream topping. Now, as I wrote to my sister who has a doctorate in music and who is also caring for Mom, that I want her family to keep the package when Mom passes.<br /><br />Mom managed to pass on her love of music to all four of us girls - to some more than others, and that love of music has passed on down through the generations. Both of my kids now have pianos that have been passed on down from my parents, and all four of my grandchildren, ages 7 - 13, are continuing to fill their homes with \\"The Sound of Music\\" as they take lessons and practice. They connect with my mom, their \\"Granny,\\" on Skype or FaceTime and play their latest pieces for her when she is able to listen.<br /><br />If you have ever enjoyed this movie - and millions of you have - don't pass up this opportunity to have it at home and enjoy it whenever you wish along with the keepsake mementos that are included.e included.
B000KQGOA4|5.0|You'd be forgiven for thinking of British composer Gustav Holst (1874-1934) as a bit of a \\"one hit wonder\\" and indeed it is likely that you may never encounter another work by him. Nevertheless, The Planets, featured in this post (incl Spotify link), is certainly a hit worthy of it's popularity and especially suitable and appealing to those new to classical music.<br /><br />The Planets was written between 1914-16, four years before Pluto was discovered. The Planets by Holst, therefore, contains only seven movements, one for each known planet and its corresponding astrological character:<br />-Mars, the Bringer of War<br />-Venus, the Bringer of Peace<br />-Mercury, the Winged Messenger<br />-Jupiter, the Bringer of Jollity<br />-Saturn, the Bringer of Old Age<br />-Uranus, the Magician<br />-Neptune, the Mystic<br /><br />In 2000, Composer Colin Mattews composed music for Pluto as an addition to Holst's The Planets.<br /><br />My favourite recording of The Planets is this one played by the Vienna Philharmonic conducted by, Herbert von Karajan. According to Wikipedia, \\"Karajan is the top-selling classical music recording artist of all time, having sold an estimated 200 million records.\\" Karajan is ranked as one of the greatest conductors of all time. This recording, made in 1961 is one of Karajan's best and most exciting. The sound on this CD is exceptionally rich and full, due in large part to the remastered 24 bit digital sound. This certainly enhances the overall experience of the piece.<br /><br />Reportedly, The Planets was a success right from the first performance due to the wealth of good melodies, imaginative scoring for large orchestra and the clearly defined character of each of the movements.<br /><br />The highlights for me are:<br />Mars, the Bringer of War is fierce and frightening, with its pounding rhythms and swelling brass. This movement is strangely reminiscent of the Start Wars score by John Williams. If this doesn't get you excited, then nothing will.<br /><br />Venues, The bringer of peace, in sharp contrast with Mars, is gentle, soulful music which exploits the sweet sounds of the strings and hushed beauty of the orchestra.<br /><br />Jupiter, the Bringer of Jollity is brisk in pace with exciting momentum. The main theme 2.52 with all its nobility is one of the most memorable melodies and moments of this work.
B001N9ESQ4|5.0|THE &#34;BEFORE&#34; MOVIES ARE THE BEST FILM TRILOGY EVER.  IT IS A CRIME THESE MOVIES ARE RATED R DUE TO LANGUAGE
1439127727|5.0|An interesting book.  It gives a whole different perspective on the Presidents that served during my lifetime.  For some I gained more respect, others I lost some respesct.
B006AX6ONI|5.0|I wish I could rate this higher than a 5. It was a great motivator and the only complaint I have is that it ended. Great Job Mark!!!
B009KS4XRO|2.0|Adddicting game but So frustrating. I cannot add to my daily chips because I have no one of my friendswho plays so I can not get the free gifted. Pieces.Almost every series. I play I get bingo on the last number called but it willnot give me. Credit for it even though another number has been called. If the screen freezes and you contact support they give you such a. Hard time with all the information<br /> they require you never get credit for it. My advice Don't.  Start playing this game. IT IS RIPOFF!<br />.
141694737X|5.0|My 21 mths old boy loves this book. He loves removing the flap and looking for various animals and then he laughs out loud each time every time. Hence for my baby's laugh - this book is more than worth it.<br /><br />Although book size is not very big but it doesnt seem to stop my baby to pick only this book from stacks of books he has :)
B00000K3D4|5.0|The movie arrived on time and well packaged. I have watched it several times and have notices no issues. The making of documentary is great as well as the movie :)
B00CO4KGYA|4.0|I've spent the last year playing Zombies Are Stupid (and the sequel), so this game was right up my alley. Find the right angle, launch stuff, knock 'em out. It's that simple, and quite fun.
0393317552|1.0|This book is super boring. I read this and instantaneously start falling asleep. So overall, I do not like this book. The shipping was excellent however :)
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved this book especially with what was happening with peeta and katniss I can't wait to read the next one
B0090KZDSK|1.0|Well, I was going to buy the book online tonight, but after reading just a couple of the reviews. I think I will pass. I really cherish my reading time, so I think I will be done too.
B00881VLCE|4.0|I truly enjoy this game. I love puzzles and this is a fun way to play with them on my Kindle. The pictures are beautiful whimsical and colorful. Surprisingly even the airplanes and motorcycles were fun to solve.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is fun and addicting. The only problem I have is that it keeps telling me to update and then it says I have the most current version and we can't seem to find any of the villains.
B0011Z7JRU|5.0|This is a masterpiece and one of my favorite, if not my most favorite, Led Zeppelin albums. It is truly one of those albums that you can listen to over and over again.
0440246318|5.0|I have read all the Reacher books and loved them all.  They are terrific page-turners and I read all of them at one sitting each.
B00008NRI7|4.0|Lucy Kelson is a Harvard-educated New York lawyer, who is a dedicated proponent of liberal causes, including her crusade to keep a Coney Island Community center open, because of it's architectural significance and because of her childhood attachment. She meets billionaire playboy developer, George Wade, and agrees to hire on as his personal lawyer, with the understanding he will support the preservation of the community center. Moving this plot to the current events of today, you have an Occupy Wall Street lawyer, member of the 99%, meeting and going to work for a member of the evil 1%. They have nothing in common, but....well you can probably see where this is heading. I know it's a familiar theme for a rom/com; but what takes this one to a higher level is the superb comic acting of Sandra Bullock as Lucy and Hugh Grant, as George...probably the two best comic actors of the modern era. In addition the script is intelligently written and this film is very funny...LOL-funny in places. If you like romantic comedy and you like Bullock and Grant, you will love this.
034547581X|5.0|Excellent details that the movie didn't have time for.  Eyewitness accounts bring stories of a story.  You are smack dab in the middle of the story being told by so many soldiers that you are in awe that any one made it out alive.
B001EO748M|5.0|&#34;There's something deep and dangerous in you, Anne, those eyes of yours are like dark hooks for the soul.&#34; The second season of this excellent piece of historical fiction takes us up to the trumped-up treason and adultery charges against Ann and her family...and the executions of Ann and her fellow alleged perpetrators.  All of them historians believe to have been innocent and it is presented this way in the series. This is a riveting and addictive series and I am anxious to see seasons three and four. Jonathon Rhys Meyers is perfectly cast as Henry and Natalie Dormer also makes the perfect Ann Boleyn, with &#34;eyes like dark hooks for the soul&#34;. If you like period drama and are not a stickler for historical accuracy, I believe you will love this series as much as I do.
B005LAIII0|4.0|just like in the movie, and like it is in real life, what part of the story you will like better? the boring, no magic and no crazy stuff, or the one with crazy things and magic involved? I guess the world has spoken, they rather have the fake, magic and crazy story about life. hope you get the point..
B005544TRQ|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed watching this show. I was kind of skeptical of it's popularity, but it turns out that millions of viewers were right. It is a great show.
B001BR7CZW|5.0|Great tunes and silly, fast action and a whole mess of car pile ups that are quite laughable now a days. I envy the crew that worked on this film. They must have had a lot of fun/ What a blast from the past!
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|I kept reading expecting more to come and would of liked more about the boy in his grown up life.  I like science fiction generally but probably would not recommend to friends.
B004GJNFHG|1.0|I was excited. I watched this with my Prime account because I was so excited. I knew there were subtitles because of the preview. The preview looked so interesting! the first 30 seconds were so interesting! They give a few pieces of historical fact while they show people in the streets pounding metal bowls on the ground rhythmically.<br /><br />So I watched it. I put aside my food though, as there was some gross scenes with feces and things, but there wasn't any speaking. It starts with some guy who I gathered later was some sort of guard at the prison. It shows him in his house, and then at the facility. We keep seeing him take off his ring, put it on the sink, and then soak his blistery and bloody knuckles. We don't know what the deal is with that. Then it goes to a prisoner. He gets put in a cell with another prisoner who has been there a while. We still haven't heard much speaking at all. They smuggle in drugs from girlfriends and stuff. They are naked except for during visitation because they refuse to wear clothes.<br /><br />That was for half an hour. (At least 20 minutes, but I'm pretty sure longer than that). I was going crazy, waiting for something interesting to happen. Some explanation. Anything!<br /><br />But it just continued on in this booooring, horrible torturous non-eventful way. I had to turn it off because I was falling asleep.<br /><br />Total waste of time, and I never even got to the hunger strikes part. I never found out why the guy had blistering hands or why the other guys were smearing their shit on the walls.<br /><br />Don't bother unless you're into super artsy movies that don't make sense until halfway, if ever.
0061122416|3.0|The book does have some good points, such as sticking to finding and reaching your goals, in spite of the obstacles you may come across - but it is not overall a very &#34;deep&#34; book, kind of simplistic in some ways.  It also uses religious references throughout which I did not care for, as well as terminology that was difficult to understand, such as &#34;Personal Legends,&#34; &#34;Soul of the World,&#34;  the &#34;Elixir of Life,&#34; and &#34;The Emerald Tablet.&#34;  It brings up various Biblical references during the story to feed into the storyline, instead of creating its own storyline; it makes one wonder at times if this is a philosophical work or a religious work; if it has a Biblical basis or a Islamic or Arabic basis, or exactly what is the author weaving into the story to get a simple point or points across?
B000YAA68W|4.0|Remarkable way of recording history and the personal struggles of the people. I found the manipulation of young Iranians by those who should know better disturbing.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I have now learned not to get in competition with my grandkids over this game.<br />They are much better at this than I am.  It seems like they are always one level above me.<br />Great game for everyone.
B00C7JGDBW|4.0|good family film questions i had about the original film where answered but still needed to go back and watch it again.
B00AKL1XPU|2.0|After spending money and getting pretty far in the game; I logged in today to find that the game had restarted me back to Level 1.  I will not play and pay again.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Downloaded this as my first game for my new kindle. I found it very easy to use. Excellent way to keep amused.
B009NYF2ES|3.0|I really enjoy musicals.  Compared with my favorites (i.e., Sound of Music, Oklahoma, Anna and the King, My Fair Lady, The Music Man, Seven Brides for Seven Brothers, etc. etc etc.), this in no way compares with any of them.  Guess it just wasn't my style.  Kind of depressing.  Should have known considering the bad guys were present.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|If we all ' read  this book, the world would be all the better for it.  Pam is  full of insight, and shares ideas in an incredibly humorous light hearted fashion.
B007UQRW62|5.0|First thing I did was scan the book and look at the umbrella.  But then I popped the DVD into the player, and the movie was spectacular...  For like the hundredth time.  Yep.  I love this movie.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I enjoy this game a lot.  I'm a fan of Bejeweled and was looking for something similar. Jewels Star is it - I think it's more  challenging than Bejeweled because of the odd shapes of the screens that effect the way pieces fall.  It also has many levels and each level can be replayed to get better scores.  It's really a fun game and just as addictive as Bejeweled.
B004JMZPJG|5.0|holds DSLR perfectly, but don't expect another len. I put my cellphone and another battery on side, that's all. worth the dollar. if you have more lens, need different bag.
B007FLHW3K|5.0|Product has multiple attachment point and fits any variations of spokes. So, no worry when ordering. When coming down the road at night, you look like a bike of the movie Tron. You literally can be seen from a mile away. Excellent purchase. You also get a lot of attention when pulling up to the bars. Kinda cool
B0073XV2W2|5.0|Giving algorithms the decision to kill has been a recurring theme in Techno Thrillers for some time now. But the political and social analysis made by Mr. Suarez on the implications is really well fundamental and doing so while delivering an action packed story that's almost impossible to put down is something very rare in deed.
B00821OX98|5.0|Good show. Nice storyline. Hoping season three becomes available on prime video soon.<br />Never heard of it until prime videos.
B0007RT9LM|5.0|A rel fine movie of becoming of age and bring a dream to reality. Great performances by great actors and actresses.<br />Piper Perabo gives a great and stunning performance in this movie. Have to love the songs and the music.<br />A great Romantic Comedy/Drama.
B0092S4WLY|5.0|This is a great game!  Just challenging enough.  I wish there were more levels but other than that, no complaints.
B000F8O35U|5.0|All of our Grand kids and kids fell in love watching this very enjoyable 3D animation movie of The Little Mermaid. They just fell in love with Ariel and all her friends.

B00CPTUNBK|5.0|This is one of the cutest and innocent cartoons I ever watched when babysitting a friends daughter. So I bought one for my daughter. She cannot get enough of it.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I like the suspense and how this book keeps you guessing. I never expected there to be so much drama. I hope you have it in you to write another book.
B00DWZHTRW|1.0|This is a bad movie, not the least bit entertaining to me.  I cannot believe I watched the entire movie. I am sure some will enjoy the computer graphics etc.
B0091REZMW|5.0|Love the game just wish the images were bigger.it gets very difficult to see some of the smaller items you need to find but it's still very enjoyable to play.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|What a great story about courage and friendship. The thought of starting middle school is frightening but terrifying when considering cranial facial abnormalities. Love the multiple points of view.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I love playing the game and it's a perfect game for the kindle but whenever I try to buy more bingo coins it rips me off.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Looking forward to the next book! So excited to see happens when they get back to district 12 and what Gale will say.
B003XVYLDU|5.0|I first encountered Slaughterhouse Five through the film version made back in the 70s. Now after reading the original novel I now know the book is a bit more linear while keeping the idea of a person who's mind goes through his life in a non linear fashion. As always the book is more detailed than the movie.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|The \\"Capital\\" and the starving, impoverished \\"Districts\\" whose labor and resources fuel the wasteful ignorant capital populace.  This series is a profound lesson on humanity and how we treat each other.<br /><br />Check out The Venus Project.

B0054YHB8Q|4.0|After Boston released their outstanding debut album \\"Boston\\" in 1976, everyone wanted to know when their second album was going to be released.  In 1978, their album \\"Don't Look Back\\" was the answer.  It is a worthy effort but nothing compares to their debut album (a fate which happens to many solo artists and bands).  Don't get me wrong, it is a really good album and has some good songs, but as I just said, how can you beat their debut album.  You just can't!  Here is what is on their \\"Don't Look Back Album\\":<br /><br />1. Don't Look Back<br />2. The Journey<br />3. It's Easy<br />4. A Man I'll Never Be<br />5. Feelin' Satisfied<br />6. Party<br />7. Used To Bad News<br />8. Don't Be Afraid<br /><br />The first song \\"Don't Look Back is their most popular from this album and it is still heard on the radio quite often today.  \\"A Man I'll Never Be\\", \\"Feelin' Satisfied\\", and \\"Party\\" are also heard on the radio today as well.  All-in-all this is a good album that over 35 years later (as of 2013) is still nice to listen to and I recommend it to all fans of the great group Boston.  Why they are not in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame is beyond me, maybe someday they will.

B00EZJX2K2|5.0|I found this show randomly on Amazon just the other day and although I have watched many shows on here, this one tugs at my heart. It portrays so vividly what parents go through after losing a child. The actors are FANTASTIC! I lost my oldest son 5 years ago and so many points hit home for me. It makes me go back and remember all the same things I used to do after losing my son. I totally LOVE this show and hope to see a lot more of it!!
0307744434|4.0|Sumptuous. Delecious allegory about competing styles of magic. Love story. Fate. Great beach read. Beautiful descriptions of sensuous visuals with wonderful intertwining character lines.

B00E978FGQ|5.0|This film was like no other film I have seen before. You will be amazed by what<br />they did and how they pulled it off.
0143034901|5.0|This was chosen for my book club. I was not able to finish it in time, but other people in the club really enjoyed it and said it was a great read. I hope to finish it soon. It was originally written in Spanish and it is a good translation in that it keeps some of the flavor of the language.
B0028RXXE8|5.0|Once again, Amazon posts what basically amounts to a complete summary of all the major plot points to a story and ruins it.  Please don't read anything above the reviews or it will ruin the experience of watching a superb two-season series of Ancient Rome.  The acting is fantastic, the characters solid and the directing is stellar.  If you are interested in this time period, you will be hypnotized by this story.  Really one of the best TV series ever, though I don't know what the third season would have been like if it had been renewed.  The last scene of the series is funny, touching and poignant.  Rome is a fantastic journey.
B008469DGY|4.0|Nice game. Great graphics. Good twist on a golf game. Makes you look like a magician of golf shots. Curving, spinning, twisting, flipping the ball around the hole. Best if you could play a complete course.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Seems to require more energy than one can gather.  Interesting concept of hidden objects and gathering collections. Objects are the same but placement very random.
B003CBTVNG|3.0|I love both Will and Molly from SNL, but although it was funny in a lot of places, the story line just did not cut it for me.
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|This was good film. I'm surprised it did poorly at the box office. I would recommend this for a family film.
0316044695|5.0|this is a must read book for anyone. Really touching story yet strangely motivating, I highly reccomend this book. fast shipping.
147674355X|5.0|I didn't have any expectations going into it. I had read reviews saying that it was good but I wanted to find out for myself.  No one can say that the book was predictable because every twist and turn completely blew me away. As I was reading that last paragraph, I felt myself tearing up. There's only been one other book besides this one that crushed me to my very core. I'm so glad that I listened to the reviews and experienced this phenomenon for myself. It easily earns a place in my top 5. Well done, Colleen Hoover. You've earned yourself yet another fan!
0307477479|5.0|After perusing reviews of this book, it seems a number of people are critical of the time jumps Egan employed while piecing this narrative together. However, it seems to me that the complexity underlying those jumps allowed for greater character development in much less space. My feelings for Bennie, Sasha, Lulu, Jocelyn, Lou, and the others intensified precisely because of a brief but pointed appearance each of them made in a previous chapter and in another time.<br /><br />At first glimpse it seems that these characters are miserable without ever choosing to be better, that they wither and age--or die--on a willful trajectory of self-destruction. But growth and change happen in subtle shifts that are often difficult to pinpoint--even within ourselves--and the path toward betterment is most often very long and rarely explosive. Egan captures this subtlety while also coloring the arduous road through time with precise and piercing insight and language.
B00BDSRFG0|5.0|WOW It makes my ears tingle with delight every time I here this CD. From start to finish it delivers a very satisfying retro 70s metal rock sound like no other. Spiritual Beggars has hit on something (special) with Earth Blues. No disappointments here just some pronominal down to earth mojo.
B00B22ASUM|5.0|Excellent book. I really enjoyed both the human and cat story. Very well written. Made me want to love on my cat even more. They are special.
B00004XPPK|5.0|One of my favorite movies of all time.  Love Rita Hayworth and Glenn Ford together.  Brilliant.<br />They were magic and didn't get enough credit for their acting abilities.
0393317552|5.0|In this book, Jared Diamond seeks to understand exactly why Europe is wealthy and other parts of the world, notably Papua New Guiana, is poor.  In other words, why did civilization arise where it did, when it did and why other people, in other parts of the world never took to civilization.<br /><br />In sum, it is due to the interaction between geography, flora, and fauna.  Eurasia, specifically the Fertile Crescent has animals and plants that are able to be domesticated.  Additionally, due to further stroke of luck, the plants from the Fertile Crescent can easily be spread along the east-west axis of the Eurasian land mass.  This is due to climate and seasonal situations being alike from east to west rather than north to south.<br /><br />What makes this book so compelling is that Diamond successfully transports the reader to the dawn of the agricultural revolution and then shows exactly what steps a hunter-gather would take to go from hunting & gathering, to farming and civilization building.  He uses this same logic and applies it to written language, inventions, and the origins of language families.<br /><br />The theory clearly lays out the big picture but misses in the smaller details.  Why, for example, did Spain become a mighty empire and Morocco a Third World backwater when both countries have the same basic climate and geography and the Moors enjoyed a head start in that they owned much of Iberia for centuries?<br /><br />A great, book that captures the reader's attention.  Best counter to a cold, rainy weekend.
B00AQK4EWY|5.0|A wonderful story, beautifully written, a masterpiece for all times (but not a fast read or else you'll miss out on all the details)
B005C4ERHQ|5.0|I've taken several different personality &#34;tests&#34; over the years and have gleaned something from all of them.  This one, however, is clear, concise and accurate.  As I took the test online I struggled with several of the questions but only having 20 seconds to respond to each one, I just answered.  Actually, I missed two of them because the thing just kept rolling along in spite of the fact that I did not respond.  As a result, I was a bit skeptical about the accuracy of the results but then I read the descriptions of my &#34;top 5&#34; and could clearly see myself in each one.  I was surprised and delighted.  Now on to the action steps suggested for each strength!
B001OQCV2E|1.0|the most messed up,unlikely movie ever the hit the big screen.Attack of the Killer Tomatoes was a lot better then this piece of crap.AVOID IT IF POSSIBLE!!!
B00DQC2FPM|5.0|Although the product looks a bit different from the product that I voted for, it is so cool. My sons and my husband watched the movie and began to build their own DeLorean. Pretty cool gift for your little boys or a big boy that saw the movie in the movie theatre in 1985!
B00992CF6W|4.0|Obviously it's not as good as the pc version. But if you don't have a pc or xbox 360 this is decent. Updates are still coming but the game is still not as well on track as xbox or pc. If you have money and you don't know what to spend it on, I would recommend six guns.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|OMG! What a voice ! I love all but one song on this CD. SHe is a genius & the music really makes you move. It also helps you emote! I listened to it non-stop for hours after I received it. I would highly recommend this album to any folks who are new to Adele's brilliance! YES!XXX
B009G41CG2|5.0|I remember when I was a little girl, I used to play Mahjong on my grandma's SUPER OLD computer. I loved Mahjong, but I've never found one like the one I remembered playing. Never until I found this one! Now, I have the Mahjong that I used to love back!!!
B0050CJNJ2|3.0|I was interested in their cross over songs from country to pop & only found one tune on the album that I felt fit the bill. I was disappointed.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Very fun! Harder than it looks, but great! I would definitely recommend this game to anyone! I wasn't sure if I would like it, but I love it!
B00CMYRVAO|4.0|I have been a fan of Joe's since his first album and  I have purchased every one and love them all.
1883217040|5.0|Excellent book. This book and \\"The Contemporary Keyboardist\\" (bought at Chick Corea's studio in the late 80's no less), are my \\"go to\\" resources - especially, when I want to try out some new voicings or reharmonizations. Frank Mantooth's \\"Voicings for Jazz Keyboard\\" you'll hear mentioned many times also. With these 3 books - you don't need any other \\"books.\\" The rest of the time is for performing and 'shedding to learn what you want to do on your instrument in whatever context.
B0071MQBX0|5.0|If you don't think you like The Phantom of the Opera, based soley on the movie, please, please give this a watch!  Ramin Karimloo, Hadley Frasier, and Sierra Boggess are amazing!  I saw Phantom at Her Majesty's Theater in 2004  when Ramin was playing Roaul- I'm so grateful to be able to own a performance of his.  I've watched this a good 10x in the past week alone!  It's THAT fantastic!
0140177396|5.0|This is the first story I've ever read written by John Steinbeck. It's simply terrific. It is a small book and the story starts without much excitement and I was even a little hesitant after a few pages since I was not sure if I could stand a book filled with so much vernacular English. It turned out, I was totally thrilled by the story after I finished reading the last word. Unquestionably Steinbeck is a master storyteller. I am going to read his other works.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|lots of games to play<br />I love just sitting a playing while waiting at Dr appt or something else. I start and stop whenever I need ti and pick back up when I have time. I usually try to get the whole game done before I have to go though
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Its awesome. It is so fun!!!!!!¡!!!! Everyone buy it because its so fun and it is free. Subway surfing is the best game ever
B008ASGP3U|5.0|I'm just thrilled that Ian Rankin brought Rebus out of retirement!  The story is classic Rebus, and if you already love him, you'll love this book.  The book ended with the tantalizing prospect that Rebus may seek re-employment as a police detective.  Here's hoping he's back for many books to come!
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|I hate to throw a towel on all the wonderful reviews on this item, but I found it to be a dud as far as I am concerned. I have a very strong internet connect with high speed cable. I managed to get through the setup with no real problems, but when I tried a YouTube video it hung up and just did the typical spinning wheel in the middle of my TV. Then I tried a Netflex movie....same issue. I really don't see the big attraction so far with the Chromecast as my Apple TV performs just great on the same network. I get NetFlix and YouTube. I found the Apple TV to be much more stable than even the Roku players. Roku does support Amazon Prime movies. The Chromecast is really limited and even the $35 cost seems low, but not worth it to me if I had to return it. There are probably many people waiting for my return so it can get back into the stock of back ordered media players. I do really appreciate Amazons returns policy if the customer does not find the product to be operational or defective.
B00ALGW286|5.0|Moscow Dreams by Julia Gousseva<br /><br />It's 1991 in the city of Moscow and simply put...fourteen year old Marina has a dream.  That dream is to pass the college entrance exams in two years and to be accepted into the Moscow State Linguistics University.  There is an equally important dream in her plans. Marina would like to \\"travel and see the world just like her father, Vasily Fedorovich\\", a cameraman. He has just spent two weeks on the job in Tibet. Upon his return, he shares a vial of sand which is a gift from a beautiful sand painting created by Tibetan Monks. It seems to signify the impermanence of life similar to sand sifting through ones fingers as Marina's grandmother explains. On the other hand, Marina's mother Vera Nikolaevna, has never had the opportunity with her job as an engineer to leave the Soviet Union.<br /><br />In order for Marina to fulfil her dreams, she has every desire to master the English language. Being fluent in the English language will definitely open up a whole host of opportunities for Marina. Her parents are encouraging her in this endeavour so that she may broaden her horizons and experience life outside of the Soviet Union.<br /><br />At this point in Marina's life, she appears to be no different than her teenage friends. She has every desire to move out of her comfort zone and make her college years memorable and exciting. However, a drastic change in the political climate is unfolding before her very eyes. On the way to meet her friend Nadia, Marina notices a huge tank driving down the street. This is unheard of at this time of the year as tanks are usually only visible when there is a parade in May...that is nine months away.  She pays little heed and continues to make her way to her rendez-vous with Nadia.  After they've enjoyed a meal at the new McDonald's, they soon encounter several more tanks. Both Marina and Nadia are curious about this odd activity and by asking a few questions, they quickly learn that there has been a shift in the political and military power of the country. An unlawful coup has been created called the State Emergency Committee that believes in the previous hard line philosophy of Communism akin to Stalin's era.  They are in the process of trying to usurp the power of Mikhail Gorbachev, legitimate President of the USSR with his democratic ideas. When Marina and Nadia make their way to the Parliament Building to listen to Boris Yeltsin address the crowds with his beliefs of democracy and freedom and the unlawful confinement of Gorbachev, he appeals to the Muscovites to stand their ground and support their leader.  Marina is angered as she sees the possibility of her dreams going by the wayside...<br /><br />Within a few weeks and soon after Marina and Nadia attend a new school in the fall, life seems to settle down.  However, Marina is focused on other important quests while Nadia is spending a great deal of time with her new boyfriend, Stanislav. Marina is also intrigue by Nikolai, with his brilliant mind and his desire to dream and make a difference especially when it comes to Communism and its lack of freedom and democracy.<br /><br />In reading and reviewing this incredible novel, I could go on and on about its merits. It is a fictional novel, a wonderful history lesson, and a story about blossoming young romance all in one.  Talented Author Julia Gousseva has done a brilliant job of embracing both fact and fiction in order to entice her young reading audience. This delightful novel will be of interest, not only as an educational tool, but also as a brush up history lesson for those of us that lived in this era.  Even much more than that, she describes the lives of two typical teenage girls and boys in Moscow and how different their long term goals are, yet very similar in other respects, as they dream of their individual futures. \\"Moscow Dreams\\" will touch the heart of its reading audience as it reaches out and informs others of life in other parts of the world.  There is always a price to pay in order to achieve freedom...to dare to dream...and to accomplish those dreams. As Author Julia Gousseva so adeptly states, when people begin to have choices, these choices can result in \\"more responsibilities, successes, and failures\\". Our world would never evolve or grow without taking risks and this can certainly create feelings of uncertainty. However, Marina and Nikolai in their innocence and exuberance soon realize that it is a risk well worth taking!<br /><br />Inspirational Author & Book Reviewer ~ Dolores Ayotte<br />[[ASIN:B00EGPIZS4 I'm Not Perfect and It's Okay]]orld.

B00BEIYMIS|5.0|I viewed this movie in the theater and was glad I did. I often refuse to see horror movies in the theater due to the teen crowd screaming and being generally annoying, but his one was refreshingly rated R--due to scariness and not blood and gore. Yet another plus.  This movie was well written and the acting was wonderful.  I enjoyed it from beginning to end. This will be one of the few horror movies I will add to my Blu-Ray collection.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This ap is easy to use and has a lot of great features. 10/10 would download again. I've already recommend ed it to a bunch friends already.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|our whole family enjoys playing this game. the youngest likes to build up the shake points until they are full but I like to use it as soon as I need it.
B00CJGP116|5.0|this is a very good CD from a great vocalist<br />Marc Anthony is one of my favorites and always puts out a great CD
B005HEVIJQ|5.0|I have watched the series over and over as opposed to any of the other star treks. Its not that the others weren't any good, (Deep space nine is also a step above the rest) its just that in my opinion Voyager is that much better. Story lines better, Character development better, technology better, It is the most advanced of all the others in more ways than one and it shows.
B003E6LC6I|4.0|Although one of the main characters had a dark energy (due to what happened in Season 1) the show continues to engage on important topics (this one being in the environment side of things) while also showing more layers of the characters
B000JQUMPI|5.0|Little Women is a classic story, one that will never grow old.  Very down to earth and a pleasure to watch.  The different character of each girl is shown in there actions.  How well they get along together even with their differences.  An example of a happy family working in harmony with each other.
B0040I09RM|5.0|Besides the fact that Jax is super cute, the show has a great storyline and the people behind the show definitely paid attention to details
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Eerie, historical, & wonderfully written. The Book Thief took me some time to get through, but I was taken away by the narration. Real literature, one I will not forget.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|So like everyone else, I LOVED Gone Girl and HATED the ending. I won't get into it, but Sharp Objects is a great story that I literally could not put down. I downloaded Kindle on my PC so that I could read this book everywhere. It has a much better ending than Gone Girl (you actually feel closure), but the story is maybe just not as good. Overall, great read and I'd definitely recommend it!
B00D8RYV52|3.0|Downloaded, installed, did not open. Uninstalled, reinstalled, did not open. Reported issue to amazon, got back generic &#34;contact us&#34; message.  Read reviews and saw others had same problem.  Wrote another message to amazon.  Tried app and it opened...?
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|This game is pretty good, rather monotonous at times. Not too easy to solve which is good. Ok if you like search games
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I just love Fifty Shades of Grey....When you believe you don't deserve to be loved. You can't stand to be touched and you live in world where the idea of it just doesn't seem reachable, you become a person that no one understands. You keep secrets and the people that think they know you, really do not.<br /><br />In walks Anastasia Steel....When Christian Grey lays on eyes on Ana Steel, there are no words to be found that can describe the need and pull he has towards her. He takes every step to find out who Anastasia Steel is and what he has to do to make her is next submissive, but what he doesn't know is that Anastasia Steel is the one person that can open his eyes to a new way of life.
B00E8KLWB4|2.0|Not to bad of a game, helps times go by.  I wouldn't recommend spending any extra money on it, but if you want to kill time, by all means, play.
B002BU4HWE|4.0|I have just seen the full-length version of Heaven's Gate in the theater and so this is a review of the film on the big screen; if you can see it in the theater as it was designed to be seen I think it will mean so much more. .<br /><br />A few disclaimers--I am usually bored at films over 90 minutes (which mean most of them) and with a very few exceptions I cannot tolerate Westerns. All that considered, I was amazed by the beauty and the intensity of Heaven's Gate. Time and again I kept thinking how beautiful the images were--amazing composition--and how I'd love to have a coffee table book of the still from this. As for it's critical revival, I think in 2013 the film makes much more sense than in 1981 with regard to the ongoing issues between the classes in our country. One final note--the final few minutes in Wyoming blew me away. I was stunned--I won't say more so you'll see for yourself. It's a tough film but worth it.
B003VANOFY|5.0|These are the best wireless headphones for under 110$, the 7.1 speaker surround sound is amazing! The 7.1 has a major difference between other headphones. The microphone is clear and cancels background noise (Works really well with skype) the functionality that you can flip the microphone up to mute it is a great feature. The headphones turn up the pc's volume with the scroll wheel on the side as well is a mute button for the microphone. The headphones also form a tight seal on your ears and don't let sound escape. Also the wireless in the headphones has impressive range almost (60-65) feet and the software tells you how much battery life you have (also telling you with a notification saying &#34;Please plug in your headset 4% power remaining). These headphones are the most comfortable headphones I have ever owned I have a pair of turtle beach gaming headphones and they are terrible to wear for long periods of time but with the g930's you forget there on your head. Last but not least my favorite part the programmable g-keys. They allow to you program everything, straight out of the box they worked with spotify  (I haven't quite figured out the multi-key macros) all in all these are the best headphones for gaming and other purposes. Thanks Alec ;)
B00BJ9VBLI|4.0|This is a delightful app. It plays very smoothly, is very colorful,  and is not difficult when it comes to winning building bricks.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Kindle is one of my favorite apps. I use it every day. Tons of books, plenty of them free, perfect for any reader.
B0038P59A0|5.0|I am an ardent fan of Sherlock Holmes and I thoroughly enjoyed this new version.  Of course, I stI Iill enjoy Basil Rathbone as the ultimate Sherlock.  I have recently introduced my young 13 year old grandson to the original Sherlock Holmes, which he enjoyed very much.  But he really liked this version and the humor in it.
B00B4Z5GDQ|5.0|This is an extremely well done and accurate look at the changes that digital sound has wrought on the recording industry. Well written and directed by David Grohl. A please to watch.
B00432QAKK|4.0|the only thing wrong with this set is the original theme song is only on the first disk the rest have a different song
B00ESY7QXI|5.0|Baz Luhrman oulls off another extravaganza of a film. The visuals are stunning and the music worked well. I was scepticall that hip hop would work, but it does.
B0013FSL0C|4.0|Enjoyed the series with different characters coming back for each session. It took me to another reality. Great value for money. Didn't want it to end.
B002HJ9PTO|1.0|i used it one day and it broke made of cheep materials, mic clip broke right away.  not made for professional use.
B001ILFUDC|5.0|My two year old really like the cricket.  He tells me that Pinocchio reminds him of himself.  He seems to get into a lot of trouble by accident.  Right.  The color quality was great.  But most of all, the movie contant makes for a great conservation piece about not telling the truth.  Alexander says he likes his nose just the way it is and that lelling the truth is much easier.  Kids they say the darnest thing.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|It's free it's fun I see no downside to this. It's challenging but not to the puppy where I'm spending hours on it.
B00005KARK|5.0|My two year old likes this move.  He gets upset when the elephants bully Dumbo.  He says that when they watch it at the Day Care the teacher makes sure to tell them that bulling is not a good and he agrees.  He love it when Dumbo finds out he can fly.  He tells me he looks so free.  At two they say the cutest things.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|Since when has AAA been in the dictionary???????????? Tell me when has it been in the Dictionary, huh tell me.<br /><br />This was wrote by a kid!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000OLGCI4|5.0|My two year loves this move and so does his pawpaw.  They watched it together on night while I was at a work and for the next three days they walked around singing the songs.  The colors in this movie are great.  Alexander loves the snake because his tail is sooooo long.  He doesn't like snakes so he laughs when the snake gets his tail caught in the branch.  He loves to sing the songs.  I would recommend this movie to anyone who has small children.
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|My kindle kept freezing, I got tried of rebooting.  Had to remove game, too bad as I did have fun playing, when it did work.
B00005JKDR|5.0|Came to me earlier than I thought.  I have had a great experince. I would recommend this to all my friends.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|fun and great game to pass the time. I love it. though some pony's are a little expensive to buy.
B00003CXCQ|5.0|Alexander thought this was a girl's movie.  But I will say this, at two year old he can tell me all the Dwarfs names.  I don't think I could find very many people who can do that.  He wasn't sure what the movie was about.  He says, A gril who stepmother doesn't like and little men who work.  I watched the movie with him and afterwards he want me to explain why she cleaned up the little men house.  He said, &#34;Don't they have a mom to help them clean up their room like me.&#34;  My sister found an older version of this move at a flea market.  I could really tell the movie industry really have improve.  The quality in the movie my sister had was very lacking.  But this one had great color and clarity. I would recommond this movie to anyone who has small children but Alexander thinks it a girl movie.
B0056BMK6K|1.0|This is a waste of time!!! Don't waste your money. Any good review on this book is FAKE!1 He admitted that he buys reviews
0553801473|5.0|It may be because this is the last book I could read of this incredible series, but also this book told the perspective of my favorite characters in Martin's &#34;A Song of Ice and Fire&#34; universe.  A fantastic read if your a fan of the series thus far.
B002ZB26AO|5.0|I found this book a very easy read and most interesting, concerning the everyday life of family and friends whom live the life in North Korea's Kim Regime.  The rules of Government as provided by the DPRK is brought forth.  Puts the reader in reality of sharing, what citizens of N. Korea endure.  Hard to imagine, that this is currently going on in todays world.
B00BSWMITK|4.0|Good Cd, just a little weak for Joe. A lot of short tracks. I like longer ones with a little more band involvement.
B0012QRPU4|4.0|Came on time; packaged well.  Ordered it because friends suggested it.  Not sure yet.  Only watched the first 2 episodes.  Reminded me of Falling Down with Michael Douglas and I HATED that movie.  Time will tell ...
0061478784|5.0|I read this book after watching the Miyazaki film and falling in love with the characters, and I must say, though the movie and the book are very different, both are amazing in their own ways. In all honesty I was expecting the book to be closer to the movie, but I think I like it a little better. I prefer Sophie using magic and discovering she's got that ability than her just thumping around and being a cleaning lady. Turnip Head being a bit more on the frightening side than in the movie is pretty good too. Then there's Howl, a character I can't deny that I fell in love with on sight in the movie. He's much more of a heartbreaking, lady killer in the book, and I still think he's an awesome character. As different as the movie and book are, I still think I'm going to love this book for years to come.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|OK, I can't get enough of this.  Watched the first season in 2 days and immediately ordered seasons 2 and 3.  Finished 2 the next weekend and am anxiously anticipating Season 3.  What a refreshing series with so much other crap on TV.
B008HJGPVO|5.0|It is a Whole  lot better then having just the one size stylus!!!! Why settle for just having the same old stylus!!!
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|It was so cool because you can do things you cant do on other apps so this app is the best app in the world so yahh get this app guys
B00DRPVE3M|3.0|its fun..just like playing at home....until you run out of gold coins...then you have to wait 40 mind to get more coins......not a lot..enough to play 1 game
B00BKTFABE|1.0|At first it worked great and I took several videos just fooling around with the color and stuff, but then when I went to the photo camera, it said that the app wasn't working. Ok, so let's try it again. Still, not working. Getting angry. Tried again. Fail. Tried again. Fail. Re installed. Fail. Fail. Fail again. Now every time I try to enter the video camera, it says that it's not working. The photo camera  works great though, but it's the same as the regular camera on my kindle fire. If they do a little tweaking to that, then it will be a great app. Please fix this! I really want to use this app!
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|the concept of a game like this is ccreative and entertaining. it keeps my attention for more than 30 minutes at a time.
B0054R6BFM|4.0|It's amazing to think about how much of an effect we have on each others lives. All so different and lived so independently but still as one body in the end. It was a great reminder to be conscious of everything I say and do because you never know someone else's story.
B0092S4WLY|4.0|Quick and fun puzzle. Great puzzles for killing time. Maybe a little too easy. But hey,  what can I say it's free.
B005V5WBFG|5.0|It's okay. It works great I love it. It protects my device. Best security for Kindle. Must have this app
B00000J2KX|5.0|I love this movie and seem to have lost my copy of it on dvd.  I ordered it on Amazon and received the dvd in excellent condition and in just a few days.  Thanks.
0062238868|4.0|Great, better than I expected. I to was in the military. I respect these guys. 2 of my friends are snipers.
B0060D15AK|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  Sandra Bullock is an outstanding actress and it shows in this movie.  Well worth the time and money.
B00B7FOQCK|5.0|Bought this hub to install 2 block erupter asic miners cause my laptop only has a few ports. The ports on this hub are spaced out well enough for most if not all usb devices and it appears to be well constructed, doesn't feel or look cheap.
B009FZHYKU|3.0|My daughter and her boyfriend have watched this and they really enjoy it.  Not for me, I guess the younger croud likes it.
B005LAIIMG|1.0|I think I laughed out loud at least 10 times during this movie.  The multiple parts where, in the face of the entire planet falling into ruin around them, where Pitt and his wife don't want him to help because \\"he's retired\\" were hilarious.  As a drama, or action adventure, this movie fails completely.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|I picked up this book to see what the fuss was about after the author's Fox News interview.  I found it to be informative and entertaining--a challenge for what is essentially a history book for lay people.<br /><br />The author was quite respectful of his topic and was careful to distinguish between history and faith, and it quickly becomes clear that this book is not an \\"attack\\" on christianity, as some of the negative reviews I've seen suggested.  For example, when discussing Jesus' resurrection--something that by definition is impossible from a hisorical perspective yet a core belief of christians, the author did a nice job explaining that the episode falls outside the bounds of historical analysis (and hence is not something he can or will assess).<br /><br />I'm sure there are plenty of topics in the book on which a lively scholarly debate exists.  This book has created enough interest for me that I'll read a few others (including those taking differing views) to get a full picture.  And for that it gets four stars.
B009LQKHIO|5.0|Finding Pride took off from the first page.  Captured my imagination.  I could not put it down.  Tastefully and well written.  I am definitely a fan and will read more of her books.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Addictive, IT'S FAST AND INTERESTING ALL THE TIME, WILL I EVER REACH THE END? I THINK IT WOULD BE HELPFUL IF I COULD SEE THE END lol
B007EECSFA|4.0|I enjoyed the book, and it was a good read. I think her characters were developed well. Nice twist, but a lot like her book The Secret Garden which I enjoyed more.
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|I loved the movie. you do have to pay attention as it is complex. it shows the human nature in real depth and shows you ways to evolve as you are fighting your demons. Beautiful!
1451648537|4.0|Story is intreating.  It is interesting how the apple computer evolved and how all the inner workings of the Jobs network created a new aura in personal computing.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|This app is awesome and really fun. I play it all the time. A real brain teaser. Awesome!!!!! Best game ever
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Captured the thoughts, worries, and humor of the human experience. Well written, I can't wait to read more of his work.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|The storyline is compelling.  The actors sublime, bringing the era to life.  Bought series 3 because I couldn't wait for January.  Were people so much more atuned to the human condition then.  Seems like every nuance could be interpreted.
B000002H5I|4.0|I really like Tracy Chapman and her unique voice. I bought the album because I love the song Fast Car. All the songs on this album are great though, and I've come to appreciate Tracy Chapman much more as a musician and as a songwriter.
1250029465|5.0|A very good story.  Good to see a man care so much for a Cat.  Bob is an awesome cat to have found James and stayed with me through all of the issues.  They make a great pair. The story about how people find work in London is very different from here. I would love to see this cat.  I'm not sure who saved who but, a bond like that will last forever.  Keep loving the cats!  they are wonderful companions.  Excellent book and hope to see more from James. Every cat owner should read this book!!
B007H9B8FS|5.0|This album is becoming my favorite Garbage album, despite my attachment to their previous ones. They came back strong after some time apart and the songs are all rocking. The variety and diversity of the music on this CD is what you come to expect from Garbage, but they take it up and notch and really deliver on this one. Highly recommended.
B00EJOCB4G|5.0|This \\"micro\\" set is a great combination of Lego and Minecraft. It's different from regular Lego sets, it has mostly simple 1x1s and is a much smaller set once assembled (the box is only 3\\" in length, width, and depth). We bought the Nether and the Village - both sets are great. You can customize modules once constructed, this gives great flexibility with the set. The sets are simple yet don't feel as repetitive as some other Lego sets. Once constructed, the modules are remarkably stable given the smaller frame.<br /><br />It would be great to have the entire collection, but at $35 a set, it adds up to be quite expensive. Price and availability of these sets seems to be varying quite a bit. I did a fair amount if research and it seems $33-$37 is the range in which these sets typically sell. If they are out of stock, they come back in stock pretty quick, so it might be better to wait for stock rather than pay higher prices (I have seen these selling for as much as $60!).
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Colorful rooms &amp; interesting  puzzles. Not so difficult you get discouraged and want to quit but difficult enough to make it interesting.

B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|I did not think Harvey could get any better than in Season 1 - well - he is smoking hot in Season 2. Fun and charming -- what a great character.
B004ZY0VHY|4.0|This is a story that raises many questions about the reason for these mass killings.  It is a very wordy book but it draws you in and leaves you with many questions.
B00DWZHTRW|5.0|Having seen this in theater twice, I couldn't wait to own it.<br /><br />I have loved illusion for a long time! The cart pulled together are fantastic. I wasn't sure I could buy Mark Ruffallo and Woody Harrelson in their roles. They blew me away. Definitely don't try to guess the ending. Just enjoy it as it unfolds. The story line is fantastic and full of action.<br /><br />I definitely prefer the extended version to the theatrical. The few things that were added made the movie more enjoyable. It flowed much better. Now I want to compare the two. It was a rip roaring ride from beginning to end. Even though I know how it ends, I still catch things I missed the first two times. The extended version is only on the blu-ray.<br /><br />The other nice thing is convenience of the ultra violet so I can watch it almost anywhere whether on my laptop or my tablet. It is easy to set up. Definitely hoping for a sequel.
B005ZOBNOI|2.0|An absorbing book but very sad and it leaves you depressed.  I am not sure what purpose it serves for those fighting cancer.
B0012TWRAO|5.0|I bought this to use with my GoPro camera.  RAM mount products are quality built and survive brutal weather conditions.  i ride my ATV thru rain, mud, dirt, and water and the RAM mounts hold and protect my smart phone and GPS flawlessly.  i highly recom
B003TOMAPC|4.0|The comic nature of the acting and references inject a breath of relief that this can not possible be real, and that is a comforting thought. The acting is good and the cast has projected the characters well. This is a good watch and a perfect movie candidate for &#34;no kids&#34; around kind of movie.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I like being able to get the weather so quickly and efficiently on my kindle with the Accuweather app! I recommend it whole heartedly!
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|It was okay, I wanted to give the series a chance to redeem itself from the 2nd book but it didn't it got worse.
B00DYOOGYK|5.0|It should be free eh u agree<br />But some people think it sucks but it doesn't I played it on my cousins kendle
B003O86FMW|3.0|Not as good as the first book but I wanted to see were the story line was going. ending was kind of just bam.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The Hunger Game series are so well written,  I really enjoyed every page of this book<br /><br />I do wish I would have skipped the last 2 chapters of the book.  I would have probably appreciated the movie coming  this fall more if I did not know the surprise ending.  Just my opinion.
B007REV4T8|5.0|I thoroughly enjoy Daniel Crage's movie and his way of protraying James Bond.  I is certainly a cliff-hanger, keeping you in suspense until the very end.<br /><br />I found it in my mailbox, right on time and well wrapped and easy to open.  Thank you for such good service.
B00884GR0W|3.0|My kids love it.  They play, they fight over it, they play generously with it and above all, they totally ignore me and school work.  They forget about eating and they make their friends wait for them.  My husband also loves it but hates the kids addiction to it.
B00006FDCD|5.0|My boyfriend had been wantinge to see this movie for awhile, it wasn't available through Netflix and I thought hey I can just buy it from Amazon! I love Amazon, great prices and a speedy delivery!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|So glad this app is free but if it was $1.00 I would buy it.this is the best run and jump yet.
0061950726|4.0|A very interesting novel about  a historical event in American history I was completely unaware of. The photos and information at the end of the book were intrigung as well.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Got mine today. Had it out of the box and running in fairly short order. Set up is pretty easy if you have all the current system requirements. Once it is set up just about any device that can access the same network the Chromecast is on can use it. The reason I give it 3 stars is that it is limited right now in what it can do. It will only stream what is out on the internet, not what is stored locally on your device. As for what it will stream that is pretty limited. Netflix, Youtube, Google Play Muisc, Google Play TV, and remember nothing that is stored on your device will stream even through the Google Play Apps. I do like the Cast extension for the Chrome Browser so I can stream my laptop browser screen to the TV. The does have promising benefits. Supposedly there will be apps flying off the shelf for this as the architecture is open and easy to develop for. When that happens and I start to see apps that will allow me stream the pictures and video stored on my phone and other devices to the TV I will upgrade my rating. Right now its MEH!<br /><br />UPDATE: There are quite a few apps available now. One of which I use to stream content from my phone is the AVIA app. I did have to spend $2.99 to unlock the feature in the app that allows streaming from my device but its there now and it works well. Since we have had the Chromecast for like 6 months now the thing its used the most for in our house is streaming You Tube videos. Which by itself is worth the price of this thing.
B00B0U2SEA|5.0|This haunting view of our history is shot perfectly, can't imagine it in color, black and white did the film justice.  A must see for all generations to come.
B000VECAEO|5.0|I bought this for my son's birthday and he loved it since he was a devoted Seinfeld fan for years.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I love how the servants react and how the family is concerned about what is happening in the servants lives.
B008469DGY|5.0|Great game. Me and my kids love playing this, excellent graphics, lots of fun for all ages. Don't listen to negative reviews this is a great golf game.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|I can't wait until season 4 to begin.  Once I started watching this program I couldn't stop until I had seen all of the 3rd season.
0399159347|5.0|I just loved this story. It was wonderful and very sad. You can't see what's going to happen until it does. Wonderful characters that are funny and yet they make you want to cry for their sorrows too. I will definitely read this author's other books and look forward to more.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|My name is in the book so go to Edward.<br />You should look at the seven Kings of England.<br />Named Edward.
B00DPKQ60A|5.0|Ariana's debut album is a wonderful mix of 90's style R&B and 50's style doo-wop. She seamlessly blends the two into an album which is enjoyable for young and old alike. Her vocal prowess is a sound to be marveled at as she fearlessly tackles whistle-tones while not hesitating to enjoy her lower register as well. I look forward to seeing this young artist grow and blossom into an incredible talent.
B006BGZJJ4|1.0|I dont like these cords. The wire inside the cord breaks. I admit I am probley harder on these cords than most people but they only last an average of 3 months. The only reason I keep buying them is because it is the type my kindle came with and I dont want to use someother kind incase there is some differance that could possibly damage my kindle. Do you have or could you reccomend a more heavy duty cord? I just think 3 months is to short a lifespan.
B0088W6IMQ|5.0|I'm hooked.  This TV series is awesome!!! I'm so glad I discovered it.  It keeps you on the edge of your seat.  The writing is excellent.
B003Y5H5AG|4.0|my kids enjoyed it so that good thing that can make movie so people can watch as a family thank u
B0080SZ0V8|3.0|I bought this game because it sounded so interesting.  However, I am new to gaming and had no idea how to play it so I lost interest very quickly.
B000W9399S|3.0|I don't really remember what it was about.  It has been a while so if I don't remember what it was about then it couldn't have been that good
1741798450|3.0|In some cases the data is not updated. Sometimes the author relies on the unchecked information. In addition to that and in accordance with what seems like a LP policy, it isn't as much as backpackers friendly as it used to be. Noticeable shift toward mid-range readers. Otherwise than that, the guidebook is ok.
B000050HTO|4.0|I think it is all just him and a guitar.  I am not a Dylan fanatic but I do like his older hits and this has them tho I think I would have liked a little backup on some of the songs.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|I like it, just that the ads seem to really slow me down, would like a version with out all the ads. Keep it simple and we will be happy campers
B0042J6VUS|5.0|I bought this for a school project. Item works great! perfect for what i needed. It holds my Iphone4s securely.
B008469DGY|4.0|Great little app. Easy to grasp concept....challenging at higher levels. As others have said, only wish you could play out the hole and/or play an entire course.<br />Highly Recommended App!
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|coin are expensive! just did not know how to play it as much as tried. not good for a senoror new tablet user.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I just loved this book. It's full of what-ifs. What if we could change the past? How much will it affect the future? Will it only affect me or everyone around me? I´m not big into time-traveling stories, but this book is a must-read. First I thought that this book might be a bit too science fiction, but not at all!! This book actually made me think. All the mistakes people do, how does it affect us? How do my actions affect other people?
1416550534|5.0|I like the history of the books, the way starts at different points and then blends all together.Wish she had another one out.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Loved the entire three seasons of Downton Abbey.  Looking forward to season four.  Have shared DVD with my daughter and her family.
1439152799|5.0|Just another good reading from Morton. I would highly recommend to anyone who likes her way of writting. Really enjoyable.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Amazingly good book. Love the hunger game books! Will be reading the third book for sure! Such a suspenseful and interesting series!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think this a great game to teach responsibility. I love it and it's even addictive. I hope they continue making games just like this one.
B005NQ5LSC|5.0|I thought this was the best of the Ip Man movies. Maybe because it was the first of them I saw on Bluray, but the story and history is so much more interesting. It doesn't dissappoint at all.<br /><br />For the record I rate the first one, #2 and the 2nd one #3. I recommend this movie for anyone who watched the first two and was left wanting more and I recommend it for anyone who hasn't watched any of the Ip Man movies, because of the backstory it's easy to follow along.
B000GDH9JQ|5.0|The dance sequences rival anything on film.  It never gets old.  And be surprised to see who MB's love is!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Suzanne Collins has created a world where even admist such turmoil, pain and death, there still lies the responsibility to be true to who you are and continually discover who that is.<br /><br />I recommend this series for anyone who not only wants to experience a futuristic world where humanity is in question, but who wants to experience the thrill of not knowing what's going to happen from moment to moment.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|Old Google Reader was clunky and not very inviting. Feedly is easier to read and more customizable, and I actually read more of the items on a regular basis.  The G Reader could present a daunting, endless project on a daily basis.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a cool calculator for my Kindle Fire. I needed something simple and easy to use, this fit the bill perfectly. Also it's free which always helps!
B008XG1X18|4.0|This is the ultimate addiction.  And self esteem stealer. So many ways to do things. Now with the added pressure of doing what others are doing
B001CDZZI6|5.0|I actually took StrengthsFinder in 2004 from the book &#34;Now Discover Your Strengths&#34; with a result of: Learner, Context, Maximizer, Intellection and Input. Then, when I purchased this book, I took StrengthsFinder again, years later, with a result of the same thing but Belief being my #5 instead of Input. This was proof to me that this assessment works!<br /><br />After reading the book and discovering more about my strengths I started to notice how they were a part of my daily life at work, in interactions with others and for myself. I then started to seek out how to guide myself in situations that would lend myself to my strengths. This book doesn't tell you to ignore your weaknesses, but how to manage them. But the most important thing is to find a way to leverage your strengths. I know encourage people I work with and my friends and family to take StrengthsFinder and read this book so they can not only discover their own strengths, but so I can learn more about their strengths and improve how we interact everyday.<br /><br />I recommend this book to anyone who wants to discover why they prefer to do things a certain way and longs to be enabled to do things in such a way that utilizes their strengths.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|This is the beginning of the revolution of teenage angst and narcissism. What a roller coaster ride for the selfies
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|Jaycee recounts 18 years of her life in tremendously brave detail. It is a difficult read at times because it hurts to hear what she had to go through. Still, it is incredible how Jaycee maintains an optimistic outlook on her future. Her story shows what the human spirit is capable of enduring and moving on from. I would absolutely recommend this book.
B00AFCEIB0|4.0|Rate a search application. The one that started them all off.  There is not much more to say.  Oh well
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Funny, witty, smart, to the point...my only disappointment in this book is that it wasn't longer...I was so entertained, I couldn't put it down.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|That is right another application review of an application which does what it advertises to do.  Wow so much to say
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I love the story line .  this game has it all.  puzzels mystery. and a great story line the graphics were cool. fun game to play.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Constant movement and fast action. No two paths the same. keeps you on your &#34;toes&#34; with an ever changing scene with multiple endeavors to complete
B00C8YOIR2|5.0|This story opens with a graveyard scene 75 years earlier. We then meet May Elizabeth Trump, 75 year-old spinster, harsh, reclusive and intolerant, who chokes to death on a piece of cake. We then read the scene where, stuck in a limbo after-life, she is looking down on her dead body. She becomes reunited with her long-dead companion, Mr Kibbles...her cat. We also hear of the death of Penny Saunders, electrocuted in a household accident, tragically leaving behind her much-loved daughter, Chloe. May teams up with Penny in a world where the dead can touch and converse with the dead; and May also has the talent of being able to speak to, and be heard by the living. She, together with others, sets up a series of séances where the dead get her to convey messages to their living relatives and loved ones, resolving long-standing problems. This is done to accrue monies that will enable Chloe to have an assured future; May becomes transformed into a person leading an active social life, with plenty of friends and willing to help others. May and others (and the story itself) flits between the \\"living realm\\" and the \\"spiritual realm\\" in an imaginative, witty and brilliantly-executed plot. And then there are the Soul Stalkers to be wary of...This is a real page-turner where you are eager to find how all the threads of the story are pulled together in a graphic and poignant finale. Not to be missed. A tour-de-force.
0446699616|5.0|Nelson DeMille has been my favorite author for many years.  His books are all story without &#34;fluff&#34;.  Wasn't sure if I would like the Al Quada plot, but once again DeMille has scored.  Hope he has a new book on the horizon.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Me and my fiance play it lots and get competitive. It gets boring but is a pretty fun game. I laugh because I am so much better than my fiance ;).
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love the characters and the plots, as well as sub plots. I love period movies and shows. It's so easy to get lost in this show and the various characters! I'm completely hooked!! Can't wait for season 4!!!!
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Love this game. Each picture keeps you coming back. Really like how the scene have you searching for different objects and in different ways
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Sweet game!! I've had so much fun playing it and itll keep you occupied for hours! I love this game!
B00C5R8364|5.0|The \\"Kill List\\" is a fast moving, well researched novel of the search for a diabolical Islamic terrorist, \\"The Preacher\\",  whose diatribes over the internet inspire several in the United States and Britain  to murder, \\"somebody important\\" for a ticket to paradise.  A parallel subplot involves the hijacking of a ship by the Somali pirates.  The son of the ship's billionaire owner, who is secretly working on the hijacked vessel, is kidnapped and bought by The Preacher to be beheaded. The main protagonist, The Tracker\\", uses a supremely talented young computer genius, Ariel, to help find his quarryThe Preacher, and to rescue his kidnapped victim. In addition to being a great read, the story includes intricate details not generally known, which is typical of Frederick Forsyth. I've read everything he's written and this is one of his best.
B0084IHVC0|5.0|Love the film. The Blu Ray has lots of nice extra features. I wouldn't pay full price for this though because it's kind of expensive. I got it for $25 and the product fits that price.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|This would be great if it worked with more apps but it works with only a handful such as Netflix. Sure I can stream from my computer in another room but that means I lose functionalities such as Pause / Start. It's close and I hope that they plan to partner with more vendors to make this a great device.
B00065MDRW|5.0|Every song is great.  It may be blasphemous to say, but I'd edit out some of the &#34;noise&#34; sections in &#34;Moon Child&#34;.  It doesn't need to be 12 minutes long.
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|I dont know of an app that takes this long to load between plays. The only reason for the star off is the load time.
B003VS0CYC|5.0|cleaner picture clearer sound. and the extras weren't bad either. I can say if you've never seen it, you'll love it. If you have seen the trilogy before then you'll enjoy the first two a lot. :)
B008IJT0CE|1.0|This app will not function unless you have Internet access.  So for you deployed warriors, you nerd to find an alternate app to drown out the sounds of combat.
B0058UXHHK|5.0|This book was awesome, at first the heroine seemed weak but then her true character showed.  She was strong & brave.  The story had me interested the whole time, and made me laugh & cry.  I am looking forward to reading the 2nd book in the series.
B000SGGUWS|5.0|Always keeps you interested in what's going to happen next or if Ali is still alive. I can't wait to read the next one
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very fun game that makes your brain work. Only 10 levels though. Hopefully there are more to come. Potato salad.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Good and practical app! Try it for yourself! It does work, even when my Kindle is closed which was my original concern-that it would not.
0763655465|5.0|The first time I read this to my elementary aged children, I couldn't help to laugh myself.  The story is well written and the pictures are very funny.  My kids love this book....especially when I use the &#34;different&#34; voices, it cracks them up every time.
B0000041LO|5.0|9 discs of superb music performed by one of the greatest chamber music groups in the world.I couldn't be more pleased.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Works Great.  Cant wait for more programs to work  with it!  easy to hook up! love watching netflix, you tube, hbogo(with chrome on my pc), etc.  it reallly works well.
B00005JNQS|5.0|This shipped faster then expected and was in great shape and worked perfectly. My children loved watching it and watch it often.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|I usually don't go for the farmville-type games, but I love Jurrasic Park so I decided to try it. Glad I did. I've always wanted a pet dinosaur and this is the next best thing. You get to run the regular park, and later an underwater park and ice age park. You can purchase stuff to speed up your game but you don't miss out on anything if you choose not to. I would highly recommend this app to any dinosaur enthusiast.
B00AYXNKIC|5.0|Great game, lots of nice upgrades from  trial extreme two. Better graphics, courses and upgradeable clothing and bikes. The big bike is a little pricey, so you have to buy coins or keep playing the courses over to get it, but still a cool game.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is the coolest app ever! I personally love horses sooooooo much. This feels like I have my own real horse.
B00B7Y0206|5.0|I really like this.  It downloads videos much faster than going to the web and downloading something.  I encourage this to be used.
B009LUBA7M|5.0|I wish that this had all the bonus tracks that are included with some other versions, but oh well. Mika's third album does not disappoint. It took me a few listens to get into it, but it takes a nice different direction from his other music.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|As much as I disliked facebook in the past, I still utilize this to keep in touch with some friends and family.  It has its advantages.  But it doesn't change the fact that some people spend way too much time on it.  Not for good, either.
B00DUGCLY4|3.0|Hard to put down. Some puzzles are harder than others. Entertaining and fun to play. Thought provoking game that keeps you guessing.
B00AFCEIB0|4.0|I prefer google search over any other search engine.  it has always worked very well for me and my family.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I'm 23. I usually put down books that start out with a 16 year old girl since that is a little passed my age range. I decided to give this one a try since my friend recommended it. I read it in one day. It captured my heart.I couldn't get it out of my mind when I finished. I wanted to read it all over again. It's witty with sentiment. It will definitely leave you with a heavy heart but it's worth the weight
B001B93H0O|4.0|I wrote an eval for the power cd which was good but this is the dvd that also includes a music cd which is a nice touch<br />the male who is the teacher and the interpreter are good - watch the feet and you will pick it up quickly<br />and then, go take a class and you will see how much you learned from the dvd
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Love this book! Loved all 3 books! It kept my interest to the end. Loved the movie Hunger Games can't wait until the next movie.<br />I recommend reading all 3 books before you see the movies.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This is a fun game to play. My 3 year old loves to play this game especially when the minion gets smooshed
B00571F26Y|4.0|Really like this book! Very interesting how our wheat has changed . Wheat today has changed a lot on how we feel. With people  getting celiac disease and having to be on a gluten free diet, much of that is because of the wheat today. The wheat we have is not like our great grand parents day when it was good for you. I won't say any more, just get the book and read it for yourself.<br />You'll be amazed on what you read. I recommend this book with any one having issues with gluten.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This show is like a tasty but wholesome treat. It has all the addictive qualities of a serial drama, such as a variety of well developed characters dealing with major and minor life events. The historical setting is informative and educational - reminding us of the hardships and fears faced by people then from various walks of life. It is really fun to watch the entire season all at once or in multi-episode blocks.
B0063M22QO|4.0|I like to use my head and my hands constantly, so when Mom said she was addicted to Mahjong I decided to see what it was like. I like strategy games and variety and this gives me both (and helps with my feeble memory too). So far I've had no issues with the game freezing up on me--and I put in many hours before giving a review. I prefer these tiles to other mahjong games because they're easier to differentiate. Overall I've gotten my .99 worth already.
B002MCYWHG|5.0|My baby loves his carrier.<br />The excitement is always wonderful to behold when he rides in it.<br />I did not make a mistake on this at all.
B000JRYOPG|4.0|It's funny how people project their feelings on to others.  But to shed some lite on the movie, isn't that what going on in<br />today's society .... ?  If those who like this movie were made in this imitation you would think that you would change up your routine.<br />Not how those seem to think this is a outline of how it to be copied! This movie reminded me of the sixties in a lot of ways  ...<br />This is a lesson for those PLAY GANGSTERS who think they are doing somethings ...
B002OSXDAU|5.0|Can be an extremely motivating story and a very sound philosophy of life demonstrated through the plot and characters.<br />Amazing!  The best fictional book I read since 20+ years... since the time of The Three Musketeers...  It would take a while to savor reading the noted passages, before starting Atlas Shrugged.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|With this guide I was able to properly format my book and successfully upload it to amazon with no errors. This book makes it simple and easy if you are using Microsoft Word.
B00000405W|5.0|Got this to watch with my daughter. Though i thought it was supposed to also come with the soundtrack for the price I was still very happy with the item.
B00E13ZRFA|5.0|Great song, love the fast tempo. Great lyrics. Makes me glad to be a ellie goulding fan. Hope I can get more ellie goulding songs soon.
6305428042|2.0|The DVD never played previews or fast play like all the other Disney movies I own. It skips and plays like a dollar movie, I believe this is a copy, not an original movie from Disney.
B00B2TE7FC|5.0|Walk off the Earth, great group, very entertaining!  This group is out of this world - love them!<br />keep more coming!
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|This was a really Great movie!!! Initially I didn't think I would like it but I was wrong.. I would definitely recommend this movie
B00DDXJRJG|5.0|Works great with Pandora! I didn't try it with my other music player, as it already has EQ built in.
B009CCBCU4|4.0|Zoe Saadia's interest in and knowledge of the Pre-Columbian America's really shines through in this excellent historical tale. I do love reading historical fiction which is based in fact where the general population was concerned as it gives you a real feel for what some of our more ancient civilisations may have been like and how they may have interacted with each other.<br /><br />The story itself is part of a saga of several books and this one joins Coyotl and Kuini, two young men from different regions who meet on the hills and who strike up a friendship which could ultimately see them fighting on different sides in an impending war. Coyotl is destined to become the Emperor of Texcoco when his father elevates his mother to first wife but war is coming because of this decision and there are many twists and turns whilst the surrounding leaders decide whose side they will fight on. For the young men, they know that this could end a friendship they cherish. When Kuini visits Texcoco with Coyotl whilst he still can, events unfold which leaves Kuini's own heritage in question. And then he falls in love.<br /><br />This is a beautiful and well written story and one which I intend to keep reading. Zoe Saadia has a real gift for storytelling and writes with a natural, easy flow whilst pulling you into a story you want more and more of.
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|I read a few of the reviews before watching this movie, and I almost did not watch it. I am glad I did. I read that the plot did not make sense. I think the plot makes perfect sense, and is interesting as well as ingenious as well as sweet. I will make one small criticism: the perfect home and machines that the 2 humans live and work in seem too perfect to be true ( but I think that the alien tech entity could easily maintain them ) Another small complaint: we are supposed to believe that this fantastic technological entity still needs humans to repair some of the machines ( I believe that this is probable, just look at our own world, machines are always breaking down ). And one other small criticism: We only see one small group of survivors ( actually, I prefer this. Some movies, like the matrix, try to show too much and thereby become less interesting ). So you see that all my criticisms actually are not criticisms at all. This story is solid, well told, moves along swiftly, and is continually interesting. Even the schmaltzy parts are perfect. There is one small but important scene which cries out for the perfect soundtrack song. I found myself thinking that this would be the perfect place to play A Whiter Shade Of Pale... and it plays!!!! The inevitable ending has two ( TWO ) surprises that actually took me by surprise. I felt warm and happy and satisfied.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great game that is challenging at parts and is fun for adults. Complete missions to unlock levels in the game.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|Fabulous writing. An unflinching account of the authors stay in a Danbury Women's Correctional Facility, and the poor choices that led her there.  The author's descriptions of her fellow inmates paints real life images of the women she spent 15 months among.  Hew experiences there, and through the 10 year period she went through the legal system sheds important light on critical failures in our judicial system, particularly for women.<br />I highly recommend this book.
B00DDXJRJG|5.0|Inasmuch as this app was offered up as the FAOTD,  my expectations weren't high, but rather cautiously hopeful.  Well, I can report that as installed on my Galaxy tab and utilized on both Amazon Cloud MP3 streaming and iHeart Radio, this app rocks with all volume and equalizer functions available and effective allowing one to extensively control audio output beyond the boundaries of the basic tab or music provider controls.  I'm very pleased with the results....thanks Amazon for a great FAOTD!
B00BCOQSSQ|1.0|I got Everville during a free promotion advertised on Bookbub.<br /><br />Some concrete suggestions for the author:<br /><br />  Fire your editors and get real ones who know how to spell check without a word processor and who know what a style manual is and how to use it.  If you paid Telemachus Press I would recommend asking for your money back.<br /><br />  The best stories begin with an inciting incident which explains a) what problem(s) needs to be resolved by the end of the story, and b) at least a rough idea of who the villains/heroes are and what they are doing.  I didn't have a clear idea of what the villains were doing until after the 60% mark.  Without a clear, and early, inciting incident your readers are frequently left wondering just what is going on.<br /><br />  Do not tell the readers what the story will be about - show them.  This can be done through dialogue.  You write believable dialogue, let the dialogue carry your story.<br /><br />  \\"Omit needless words\\" (Strunk & White).<br /><br />  Your use of the first person narrator was frequently confusing - is this character Owen, or Carwyn?  Having multiple characters referred to as the Keeper is also confusing, especially at the end.<br /><br />  When you drop a name into a sentence without introducing the character you leave the reader confused - who is this? has this character been mentioned before? what is their role in this story?<br /><br />  I enjoyed the inventive names of your characters.<br /><br />  After finishing the story I'm even less certain that Carwyn's adventure is relevant to Owen's.  Other than happening in the same location and having a few differences in description which is not intrinsic to the story, what is the point of it?  Do your readers really need to be told twice what the First Pillar is?<br /><br />  I liked Carwyn's adventure more than Owen's, mostly because the time Owen spent at Easton Falls didn't appear to be relevant to the story.  Yes, if Everville falls EastonFalls will be next, and yes Owen's friends (who can't travel through dimensions) play a role in the climax and yes, one of the villains is back in Easton Falls.  All that said, it is not clear why Owen must travel back and forth between the two locations.  Every time Owen did I found myself asking why and never finding a compelling reason.<br /><br />  You interrupt the Roundabout to go back to Carwyn's adventure.  That's like putting a commercial right in the middle of the rising action - and then you never go back to the fight, robbing your readers of the climax.<br /><br />  How is Owen letting his bo-staff do the fighting for him not cheating?  Why is the Roundabout even in the story - so that the main characters can go to Samil's estate? Why do the character's go to the estate - so that Owen can see the painting which is already established as being part of Samil's collection and be creeped out by premonitions also hinted at in the café and other places?<br /><br />  Why is the Roundabout hosted by the Art Club - what does it have to do with art?<br /><br />  I have serious issues with Daga (one of your best characters).  Is Dagda a primate that purrs, or a feline with hands?<br /><br />  You used both \\"it\\" and \\"he\\" to refer to Dagda.<br /><br />  Dagda plays a vital role in Carwyn's adventure, but your descriptions are irritatingly inconsistent - is Dagda large enough to drag Carwyn to safety, or small enough to be thrown across the crevasse, or is Dagda a shape shifter?<br /><br />  Once Carwyn reaches the First Pillar Dagda drops out of the story.  For such a major character that's a major no-no.<br /><br />  If you drop Carwyn's adventure, if possible, keep Dagda.<br /><br />The most important tip I was ever given was: Never let your readers wonder \\"Why am I reading this?\\"  Give them an answer before the question can even be asked.  \\"So that I can leave a constructive one-star review on Amazon\\" is perhaps not the worst possible answer you could leave us, but it's not the best either.
158270208X|5.0|Great handbook to anyone serious about following The Secret to better themselves and their life. Great help for daily records.

B004Q3UL2O|3.0|A thinly veiled movie with great possibilities that is cloked in a PHIZER COMMERCIAL.  Product placement went way to far for this movie.  It could have been very touching.
B00B9E29CI|3.0|Interesting research but more about kids growing up in really tough circumstances than a parental guide for the average joe
B00B22ASUM|5.0|This is a warm, inspirational book about the powerful force our little furry friends can have in our lives.  You hear so many stories of the health benefits pets can bring to our lives.  This little guy--Bob--was the motivational force for James to make some life altering (saving) changes.  Good for you, James, and well done, Bob!
6305428352|5.0|Richard Dreyfuss does a great job in this movie! Love the message the movie gives...that music is such a vital part in education.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|A beautifully written novel. It is amazing how you are taken across generations and continents in and out of the lives of strangers whose lives touch one another in the most unexpected ways.

0312330537|5.0|You step into this tale and it will stay with you long after you have read it.  I couldn't put this book down.  It was almost made into a movie but things fell apart at the eleventh hour.  Some readers have questioned the authenticity of the tale.  I say 'who cares' - it is wonderfully written and as vivid and vibrant as the landscape and people it depicts.  If you haven't read it, don't hesitate...
159463176X|5.0|A very entertaining book of the old world culture and customs. The author did an excellent piece of writing about that way of life..
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is very fun and I really e enjoy playing it.I play it almost everyday after school or after church. This is one of the best games I've ever played.

B00011CZRE|5.0|BRAD WAS GREAT IN THIS STRANGE MOVIE, THAT AT TIMES IS HARD TO FOLLOW, BUT STILL A GOOD MOVIE  BUY!
B00ECU34ZM|1.0|Not worth the money at all. Tom tried his best but it wasn't his film. Got tired of watching it about halfway through because it started to get a bit repetitive.
B005544TRQ|4.0|I Like this show it's smart and stylish.  And full of pretty people  I will get season two and three.
B0007MAO0M|5.0|This is the version of Silverado to own.  Two discs, with a welcome bit of special features and commentaries.  The playing cards are a cute bonus, as well. One of my favorite westerns, a genre I rarely watch, but this one is special.
B009LQKHIO|4.0|Good storyline of woman surviving tragedy and discovering there are good people still out there.  Would have liked a bit more about what happened with the brother, the tidbit about the Porshe was thrown in out of nowhere and didn't seem to fit.  Story moved at a fast pace but still believable.  Glad Megan got a happy ending, hope there are updates to her in the rest of the series.  Still works as a stand alone story if you don't choose to continue the series, though.  I am looking forward to continuing the journey with the folks in Pride!
1250012570|5.0|This one made me stay up too late reading it to find out what would happen. And why? Because I love me 80's pop culture, comic book references, awkward and 'outsider' characters, biracial Asian characters, and romances where everything isn't insta-sweet, sticky love.<br /><br />Park is just trying to keep his head down and not get noticed. As long as he just sits on the bus listening to his music, the bullies in the back leave him alone (except for semi-rascist questions about Kung Fu.)<br /><br />One day, a new girl gets on the bus, she's big, flame-haired, dressed in thrift-store rejects, and has no place to sit that won't get her roasted alive by the bullies in the back.<br /><br />Park has a moment of weakness, and lets her sit next to him.<br /><br />He is the \\"weird asian guy\\" and she is a constant source of embarassment..until...slowly, the weeks of sitting silently together on the bus force them to start seeing beyond the uncoolness and embarassment. She slyly starts reading his comics over his shoulder, he makes mix tapes for her, and they finally ,finally start talking.<br /><br />It's not all easy-peasy from therein. There's issues with her evil stepdad, hazing, Park's own insecurities about being a bit more emo than his jock father, constant trying to not be noticed by bullies, and hiding the relationship from family members.<br /><br />But the short paragraphs switching between Park and Eleanor's POV are addictive, like salted, buttery popcorn in their melt-in-your-mouth painful, raw honesty and wanting affection.<br /><br />These two are lovely human beings, and even with their own failings (unwillingness to trust, concerns with coolness) we fall in love with them, too.<br /><br />This book's snack rating: Kettle Corn for the sweet-and-salty YA \\"geek\\" romance with addictive POV switches and yummy characters you can't help but gulp down
0979019710|5.0|Before this book, I was definitely not a morning person. But Hal convinced me to make the leap (out of bed), and I have to say I'm now really enjoying getting up early! I feel so much happier, more energetic, and more productive. Putting yourself and your goals first every day is definitely the way to go!!
B00BZW5W3W|4.0|I was introduced to Maysa and I just love her voice. Sultry and soulful. She is a gem. I feel at peace when I listen to her sing.
1892005034|5.0|I enjoyed very much reading this book. It helped me observe many conflicts I have inside. I am now able to understand easier why I react the way I do to different situations.<br />This book gives you tips on how to be present in any situation, conflict or etc. And how to express yourself in a way you dont hurt yourself or anybody else. Many problems can be avoided just by expressing what we really feel or need correctly.<br /> This book also helped me connect with myself. Loved every chapter. Highly recommend it.
1442481919|4.0|I didn't realize this set was quite a bit larger than the baby books I had owned.<br />But they are still nice.<br />Not so sure that small babies will be able to handle as well.<br />So if you want it for a baby gift....<br />Order the smaller books.
B00CATSONE|1.0|The title of this book is very much misleading.  It was more of a self-help type of book for those want to know about how others were great in thier lives.  If you are primarily interested in a book on the life and accomplishments of Nikola Tesla, do not get this book - look elsewhere.
B004EBT5CU|4.0|Since this was a requested gift for my granddaughter, I really have no way of rating it.  I just took a guess.

0312379293|5.0|I have read many of Jeffrey Archer's novels and this is, without doubt, one of his best.  I kept on wondering what awaited me within the next few pages.  It held me spellbound until the end.
0451418441|5.0|I've read the book before but never owned my own copy so I know that when I do get to read it, I'll enjoy it immensely. I loved it the first time I read it and I know that I'll never get tired of reading this one or the first one of the series.
B003XVYLDU|5.0|The total insanity of war is spelled out with black humor and irony.We are all time travelers and have no choice but to be part of the pathetic human race. Flows like honey. Great imagery. Read it in a day!
B008469DGY|4.0|The game is really fun, and challenging enough to keep you playing trying to get gold. My only pet peeve is that once you have one trophy, the game doesn't show you what score you need to get the next trophy.
B000YABYLA|4.0|This is a fairly good movie with a good meaning behind it.  I enjoyed watching it.  I would rent it however versus buying it.
B005TKC2P2|5.0|I loved the way this was written, it was very quirky and if you like books with a little &#34; out there&#34; storylines then you will like this. I found the characters drew me in, I could not put it down. It is not a fluffy book, you need to concentrate but once you are into it, then you are captured u til the end.
B006X9EUUS|5.0|I am a long-time Sinead o'Connor fan. I will usually give her music a chance whenever she releases something new. Most of her work can be found on my iPad. This new release has many grat cuts. If you love Sinead's music, this is a great addition. Many of the songs are uplifting or empowering. Get this music!she still rocks!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love it, so lifelike  specially for those who really want a horse<br />I recommend it for all horse lovers..
B00ESY7QXI|5.0|Way better than the Redford version. The glitz and glamor was to perfection. Leo was captivating as Gatsby and didn't disappoint.
B006N0YWGY|1.0|I`ve played many types of games over the years on many different systems. I`m not the best, but I catch on quick and my reaction time is pretty fast. I tried this game on my droid and a tablet and it`s impossible to enjoy. The effectiveness of the controls vs. the speed of the game don`t make this an enjoyable game to play.

I'm so like this book and I want to say so much more, but right now can be able to praise this series as it should be without put details of the story and I really want you to read it and found out by yourself how wonderful and ingenious it is.

After reading reviews on amazon tried several different attemps but never got more than a 25% signal strength.  Ended up ordering the TP-Link and worked like a charm first time!

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This story definitely deserves a five star rating. it is beautifully written.... it is a tear jerker and has an amazing vocabulary... Give this five stars because it is so realistic and the context of the book is just... beautiful... I fell in love with the characters... John Green actually made me feel like I knew Agustus Waters. This book is amazing. It definitely a must read. I read it on under a week.

B0097HSS4M|5.0|This is a great app! Easy to use for anyone. I want to use it on all my photos<br />.
B000H6SXMY|5.0|What, you didn't buy each season as soon as it was released on DVD?  You were living under a rock all this time.  Whatever the reason, you now need to make up for lost time and get the complete season of Friends.  Share in all the laughs, tears, loves, antics, losses, and surprises that spanned ten amazing years.  That's all I can tell you and that should be all that is needed to go out and get this amazing series to hold onto and treasure forever.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|The first movie in a long time that my wife and I were able to sit down and enjoy and actually get all the way through it.
B0052SF6CM|5.0|This album holds a record in the UK for the most top 10 singles from one album with 9. That means there are 9 songs in this album that are good enough to be played over and over again on the UK radio. Overall, the album is great from start to finish. There's pop sing alongs with \\"Need Your Love\\" \\"Thinking Bout You\\" \\"Feel So Close\\" \\"We Found Love\\" and others. There's also funky tracks like \\"School\\" and \\"Awooga\\".
B000V7J82S|5.0|Should always be the first vinyl purchased in anyone's collection. Great with or without herbal enhancements. Don't worry about a thing.
B00CV5ZPA2|5.0|This album has such a futuristic and innovative sound it feels out of place now. As a rap listener turned EDM fanatic I think it's awesome that Kanye can embrace such strange sounds and turn them into a great work of art. Every song can be argued as the albums best.
B00CRMWMZ0|5.0|I've been a fan of Daft Punk ever since their Discovery album came out and found Random Access Memories to be an excellent addition to my collection. It sounded to me almost like-true to the title- I was listening to a stream of memories in musical form, from the wonderful &#34;Giorgio by Moroder&#34; to the whimsical &#34;Touch&#34;. My only annoyance with this is that the bonus track that came with the Japanese release, &#34;Horizon&#34;, is not included or apparently for sale on Amazon US. In any case, it was well worth the wait and I can't wait for more material from these guys!
B004DH8IK0|5.0|This album is my favorite album of all time and it really is amazing how many excellent songs can be packed into such a thin disc.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|This wasn't one of my favorite books, but I did enjoy it. I think readying the other book giving his perspective would be interesting.
B004KBSQOW|5.0|Love the rendition of Somewhere...His voice is so mellow and soothing. Try it, you'll like it. Came from far away but worth it.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I love this game but I have no friends I know on my friends list.you draw stuff and the other person has to try to figure out what the word is
B001EC3JME|3.0|I ordered this and it came as described but would NOT comfortably fit my Streamlight Stinger DS. Smaller flashlights it works fine on.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|This app is grate It helps me get to school in the morning I recommend it for you hope you like it
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|This game does keep my interest and has beautiful graphics. The only thing I can't seem to find are basic instructions for playing so I'll know what I'm doing. As far as additional costs, I've played for four days and haven't spent any additional money.  I'll definitely watch for more games by this creator.
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|Love the tournament aspect with play among friends. Attracts a wide variety of people, young and elderly.Improves eye hand coordination .
0385528752|5.0|Chip and Dan Heath really know how to explain how to get other people to change the way they are doing things.
B00AEFY66U|5.0|Excellent movie! Saw it years ago and needed to see it before we saw the Leo release! 5 stars! You gotta see it
0345472322|5.0|Read this book then look around and see which people are getting things done. You will see the Growth Mindset is what works.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I love it it is 1 of my top apps and I have about 50 it needs to get updates faster though.
055380684X|5.0|Along with Malcolm Gladwell, this book really explain achievement. It is not something you are born with, it is something that is acquired by hard work. Not just any hard work. Here you will find out how.
B000L53D4O|5.0|When they are at the age they are holding your hands and walking, this is great.  They just need a little help in the beginning and then watch them go.  Or if they are younger they can sit and play with all the gadgets, it will keep them busy and help with their fine motor skills!!
B004RKXN44|5.0|Couldn't put it down. One of the best in a long series. Have read and re-read over. Strong pair and loved how the other characters were folded in without loosing focus on the development. Long enough and yet, left you wanting more.
B004MNO0BQ|3.0|This game is fun for two people to challenge each other and settle scores.<br />We use it in place of rock, paper scissors.
B000I0XLYO|2.0|in a hideous i cant tear my eyes away kind of way. it is stupid humor but much more tolerable than... say.. dumb and dumber or pet detective//jim carrey humor. Run away!
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|This game is like an old friend. I was happy to see it for the Kindle Fire. It does burn through the battery, though.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|love this game for just kicking. back and relaxing<br />I'm 16 and I love this game! so addicting<br /> you should definetly get this app.
B003VQQG8K|3.0|Didn't live up to Angels and Demons. While reading, you get the impression the author is trying to make the United States seem cool/interesting. The one bonus is that this version of the book has illustrations of the points of interest being mentioned throughout story. For those interested, it gives you an easy guide for visiting those same areas in person.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|One of the best shows on television. George R. R. Martin is a masterful storyteller and HBO has done an excellent job of bringing the story to television.
B0022Q8CSC|3.0|I understand Mario Puzo wrote The Godfather for the almost sole purpose of 'cashing in', and having a runaway commercial success. Mission accomplished. This novel, and the subsequent screenplay also penned by Puzo (with co-writer Francis Ford Coppola) have become part of our common culture, and helped spawn a new 'mobster' genre that continues today. That said, after having seen the movies, and finally delving into this book, I was rather disappointed. Puzo's writing style-- at least in this work, with its acknolwedged mission-- is perfectly accessible: straightforward, plain-spoken, uncomplicated. It's also artless in the 'crude, inelegant' sense. One could argue that that is aligned with the brutal, blue-collar nature of the story, but the sentence fragments, repetition, and heavy-handedness just seem unpolished. Hey, it's a good story though, an easy read, and created a legendary franchise. So, meh--
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|I understood this to be a grown-up novel, it was written through the eyes of a seven year old,seemed more middle school reading. good story, a little out there with little understanding of the out there!
B0091REZMW|4.0|This is a pretty good game. Just takes a little time. Which is no different than other games I've played.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|I've been a Star Trek fan most of my life, and a TOS fan nearly as long. I adored the new movie. Some people complain about \\"excessive\\" borrowing from TWOK, but I absolutely loved the way they chose to parallel some of the most poignant moments of the original films, with the Abramsverse twist. I saw the film 10 times in the theater, and every time my eyes were glued to the screen and my heart was in my throat at the crucial times. Kirk really grew into his role as a leader, and Spock really came across as both more at ease with his humanity, his emotions, and his experiences in the previous film also gave him a slightly angry edge - but can you blame him? Another wonderful, addictive installment in the Trek film series. Let's hope they don't make us wait four years for the next one.
0807014273|5.0|Took this to work with me and have had many of my client's ask if they could read it. Who better to learn from then someone who went through the unimaginable and lived through it!
B00D0Z2JR4|5.0|To all those complaining about the price, ignore those reviews. This product is imported! This is not a Region 1 dvd, this is the japanese version of Dragon Ball Z Battle of Gods. It is only coming out on DVD on 9/13/2013 as of now. For those that do not know, importing dvds or any sort of goods from Japan is expensive.
0451228731|4.0|I won't bother summarizing the story here, as other reviewers have done it better, but suffice it say Daemon was engaging enough that I finished it in two days. I enjoyed the story, but when I started to near the end and things weren't wrapping up, I got the sinking feeling that a sequel was planned. I'm not a fan of multi-book sagas, but I enjoyed Daemon enough that I'll probably give the next one in a series a try.
B005MLOOJA|5.0|Love this series!!!  Can't wait to see the next.  I would highly reccomend.  Love the love triangle. Perfect mix of entertainment.
B008M87GJK|5.0|Finally a news outlet that is not leaning to the left or the right.  News right down the middle.  Love it!!! You get a variety of news from breaking to international to even science and technology.
0060578793|5.0|This is really a great guide. I think there is a revised edition out but the information in the older versions are detailed enough to not make much of a difference. The guide covers numerous situations and shows you how to 'survive' through them. The guide is not enough though. Surely it will help you but the best way to survive is to be experienced in certain crafts in the first place.<br /><br />The book is too big. There is no way I would lug it around in a pack, that is my only negative, and not enough to take away a star. There is a compact guide, I'm sure. But this one deserves 5 stars, too!
B0010SKUYM|5.0|Both well written and so so hard to put down. Only one more then a long wait. Wait wait wait!
B003YFIUW8|5.0|Great book...very real. You really felt like you were inside the room with the mother and son and seeing the world from their point of view.
0143118706|3.0|This being the next chapter into the Eat Pray Love book, I thought it would include more of reflections and what happened thereafter, but it reads more like a research paper than storytelling.  Sigh~<br />I like research-related reads, like lot of Michael Lewis' books, but...guess it just isn't what I was looking for.
B001E45XT4|4.0|The headset arrived on time and works as expected.  I have only been using for  a short time so I don't know how it will hold up.
B001AGXEAG|5.0|One of the funniest movies ever made. I saw it maybe 40 years ago, and it is just as funny today.  It just doesn't get old. A ghost movie that is an absolute hoot.  All that and Harry Belafante too.  I am so glad to have it still available.
1451629192|5.0|A very sad story yet it does have a good ending to the girls ordeal.  Bood was new, sort cover.
B00DBSZJRM|4.0|A simple plot that was fun and action packed. Great costume design, good music, and proof that a decent movie can still be 90min long.
1419702238|5.0|kid loved it.  Was a good purchase.  I'd reccomend it for any kid to get into the stories.  Nice book
B0091REZMW|4.0|Fun app easy to play. I just started play it and I really enjoy it. I can't wait to get the whole mansion unlocked. So far I only have related rooms.
B006ONOVFM|5.0|second time reading these books and it just gets better and better, I'm so excited for the movie, great read!
B008469DGY|5.0|I love this game.. I spend hours a t a time playing..you just cant put it down once you start playing..I think everyone should give it a try..its a free app for the kindel fire.
0743270754|5.0|This book reveals a side to Lincoln that I had not appreciated before—his skill at handling people and ideas. The reading group of which I am a member was very impressed both with the man and the writing.
B00881VLCE|4.0|Friend recommended this. I have enjoyed it. Like the calming music option. May get through the free puzzles too quickly.
B008J05EL8|1.0|Won't open. Won't open. Won't open.  Just installed it, rebooted and it won't open. I uninstalled it. I would like my money back.  Don't make me go through my credit card company because you won't respond.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|This was great step-by-step information! I will definitely be using this with my next Kindle book. Feels a lot less overwhelming.
B008HJGPVO|5.0|I purchased this along with the Marware stylus and prefer this one.  It's more versatile for using on different items because of the three tip sizes.  Also is a little longer and heavier than the Marware stylus which, I think, makes it easier to store in a briefcase.  Nice product.
1580176941|5.0|This book is packed full of excellent recipes, tips & decorating ideas.  I really like that the authors grouped cookies by event/celebration, It really helps jump starts my creative process.  I'm very happy I purchased this book.
B00C5R8364|4.0|Forsyth has long been one of our favorites - his suspenseful thrillers and often twisty endings invariably please.  Moreover, several of his recent books reflect trouble spots in contemporary history:  Afghanistan, Yemen, and herein - Jihadist inspired terrorists based in Somalia.  The \\"Kill List\\" reflects that the \\"Preacher\\", some otherwise unknown English-fluent Jihadist, is broadcasting internet sermons advocating that Muslims turn Jihadist, and take out just one public servant or VIP in either \\"Big Satan\\" (the USA) or \\"Little Satan\\" (the UK), prior to committing suicide en route to \\"Paradise\\".  After seven such murders, the Preacher is now a highly sought terrorist scheduled for elimination!<br /><br />The book details how a very clever Marine Lt. Colonel goes about discovering the identity of the villain, and his whereabouts, and concocting a scheme certain to lead to his death by means other than assassination.  Whether those efforts will meet with success and what happens in a sub-plot detailing a piracy off the coast of Somalia, were plenty to keep us entertained and engaged.  Other than the murders, which did not get heavy play, we liked the tactic of featuring the hunt and the hunted rather than the crimes per se.  If you like intricate action more than intricate characters, you'll be readily accommodated with Forsyth's latest!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This is a very simple dongle that turns any TV into a &#34;smart&#34; TV (Though smart TVs are not very smart anyways). Installation is a breeze. Just follow the steps and you should be fine.<br /><br />Reponsiveness is a bit slow with the iPhone 5. It takes a few seconds for the app to start playing and there is a lag time between the time you hit pause in the App and the video actually pausing. Other than that, it's a pretty solid device.<br /><br />For $35, it's a bargain.
B003U0AHBO|5.0|Great Movie.  New take on the history of how Robin Hood came to be.  Russell Crow was magnificent in the role.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|It has a good story, the plot moves fast, stylish and entertaining! The end surprises too! MArk Ruffalo is good. Overall a good movie to watch!
B00005JO5L|5.0|I love this movie but why does the director give us so many suspects. The drag queen in the police station complains about getting harassed by two cops from the sixth precinct[Simone & Jerry]. They show the killers mouth, nose and voice when he kills the guy tied on the bed. You see several guys throughout that could possibly be the killers. I personally think the director goofed bigtime!. If you watch the whole movie again you notice that the guy that was killed in the park at night matches the killers mouth, nose and voice from the tied up gay guy. Then they show Stuart[Richard Cox] several times as a possible suspect. The last death reveals one of the sixth precinct cops[crime scene cop] that was harassing the drag queen. But at the end it show Nancy[Karen Allen] wearing an identical outfit that belongs to Detective Steve Burns[Al Pacino]which looks similar to the killer, not to mention that suspicious look he gives before the credits roll at the end. Proof= The director used the guy getting killed in the park for the close up shots of the tied up gay guy getting knifed in the back, try to follow me on this. He matches the killers look and sound. And yet to me suspect number one has to be Steve Burns[Al Pacino]. Forget about Stuarts BF Gregory played by James Remar, he's not the killer. The director goofed bigtime!!
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Love this game, really enjoying the game can't wait if there's a second one and only down fall is waiting for the energy to refill  :D
B001NLKT60|4.0|I Liked the web of intrigue & problem solving within the book. I enjoyed the drama of the situations and the suspense. I liked the story better than of the other big book suspense novels I have read (Jack R.). I didn't like the time spent going back on the prior novel, the Girl with the Dragoon Tattoo, as a set-up plot for this book. And, it was a little far fetched on the failure of the Police Vs private investigators in solving the plot. About a third of the way into the book, it really took off and got to be very interesting reading.
B0091REZMW|4.0|This hidden object game is definitely one of the better games I've played! It kept me busy for hours. The only thing I don't like is having to spend money to continue playing.[[ASIN:B0091REZMW Mystery Manor(Kindle Tablet Edition)]]
140006922X|3.0|It was not my usual reading genre. I prefer books to escape into. I like to be entertained when I read. Going through college I had to read enough thought provoking material.
B00DJYJQ36|5.0|It's a true mark of craftmanship when it looks like you are watching a natural conversation between two people.<br /><br />This film was the hardest to watch of the three, but yet it was also the most mature and brutally honest in the series.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to purchasing this on Blu-Ray, but I wish that Warner Brothers would \\"hop on the bandwagon\\" and release \\"Before Sunrise\\" and \\"Before Sunset\\" on Blu as well.
B000005YZM|4.0|Well just like one of the band members said, they had grown a bit stale, and this album reflects that.  Still worth having though.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Angry Bird took the planet by storm with its macabre sense of justice against the evil egg stealing pig - you move from level to level (to level) of high flying bird destruction to win victory!  Essentially each level is a different puzzle of sorts where you need to aim, fire, and sometimes use a particular bird's special power to kill all pigs and destroy as much scenery as possible to rack up the points.  In the Star Wars version you pretty much do the exact same thing but with all the off-world, outter rim action (and music and campy birds at a Star Wars convention) you can handle.  I might be lame but at least I always know where my Kindle Fire is - and let me tell you - playing on a nice big Kindle screen vs. small smartphone makes a HUGE difference.  If you don't own one, consider purchasing one.
B005PK57IK|5.0|I am an outdoors kind of guy. My taste in movies usually revolve around action, be it western, war, cop, etc. with a good dose of sci-fi and horror but to be honest, this is one of the best series I have ever seen. Top notch casting and perfect writing. I loved it from the first episode on and have yet to be disappointed by a single episode through all 4 seasons. Hats off to the series. I can't believe it but I am a devout fan, totally hooked and can't wait for more..!!!!!
B000005JAX|5.0|This was actually a re-purchase as I had this wonderful EP back in the day (a Thursday if I remember right) which is filled to brim with wonderfully cherry picked covers.  In a band full of 'out of the box' thinkers, Gore was always my stand out favorite and he brings his considerable talents to synthpoping these classics up (Motherless Child, WOW, the best track on the disc and that's saying something).  A must have for anyone 'into' the New Wave, SynthPop, and Post-Mod senes :]
B008MN6WP4|1.0|Extremely disappointed. The DVD did not work in my Sony blueray DVD player due to region code.  No where in the product description did it say anything about risk of region code.  If so, I would not have purchased it.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|So happy to have found this Calculator... it is easy to use, great when you go out to dinner you can get a fair tip to leave for the waitress/waiter.
1451695195|5.0|Book was well written.  This one I believe to be a true experience.  Being it is from a Neurosurgeon's view he goes into detail of why he and other doctors did not believe NDE experiences...to define how this experience did not fit that criteria.  Good book for a logical person whom wants an objective perspective and I believe this man &#34;really&#34; had an experience.
B000FBJAOG|4.0|This book was very well written, extremely detailed. I feel like I could actually survive the zombie apocalypse. Unfortunately the end of the book is very slow. If you're a zombie fan five this one a read.
B008XK69S6|3.0|With most co0mputers, you might need one or more music players to play all your music into one perspective. That is the case also with tablets as well. They have each had that where one music player isn't enough. The n7player Music Player is one example. It works fairly well on my tablet, with a few glitches. It can take some time for it just like my tablet to recognize it. It has a strong artists menu and a good music equalizer, but other than that it isn't actually different for its money. Still I like it, but the bigger versions are more worth the money. If you own a Android device, this is one worth checking out, but not as much for your music downloads.<br /><br />Convience: C+<br /><br />Setup & Display: C<br /><br />Overall: C 1/2+
B009LQKHIO|5.0|This was a very good read. I enjoyed the characters and the  story was compelling. The suspense and journey to love were a great pair and made the story worth finishing soon. I look forward to reading the rest of the series.
B009GXHOW4|5.0|Ok I just cant explain how cool this app is. I have full chain mail armour,  64 iron ore,  and infinite health in SURVIVAL! If you are afraid this app might crash your tablet,  let me reassure you. I was afriad to get it,  but I read the reviews and got it and let me tell you......... ITS EPIC.
B00AG475K8|5.0|One of our favorites! All 3 of my teenaged kids loved it! Great addition to our DVD collection! Great cast!
B00DYCBH4O|5.0|The pictures are a really nice touch to a novel that I consider one of the best ever written. It's a classic that can be re-read each year.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|The Dark Knight saga ends with some great closure.  Hathaway's Catwoman is very believable as a cat bugler. and bane, well he's just scary. I think the second movie is still the best. but this one does a good job at building on Nolan's vision of Batman.
B004CFAWK2|5.0|You will not be able to put this down.  The narrative alternates between newspaper clippings and the conversations of an elderly woman in a nursing home and a woman regularly visits the nursing home to see her mother-in-law.  It was also a best seller.  I read this book once twenty years ago and again recently as part of a graduate course in gender studies.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|I will love to play this game with more people, Its strategic and fun, I can see why it is a must have in your gaming library.
B00BJ64FU0|5.0|Love BBC Sherlock, so I had to get the complete stories! Very nice with pictures and it's easy to read for my tablet.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|The problem solving really gets my mind going. I like puzzle games I really believe it helps my brain stay sharp.
B0040I09RM|5.0|The series was highly reccomened to me by a friend.  I am hooked and cannot find enough reasons not to watch it, guess I better get through it so I can cut some firewood - winter is coming fast. Godd thing it will give me raeson to watch again!
B00005JLD4|5.0|Love old movies, with some history to them.. its like learning something about our country and others through the power of a movie...
B0012QRPU4|5.0|I finally got the time to get into this series...all that I've read was true. Cranston is mesmerising as Walter White. I watched the 1st season and quickly ordered the rest (pre-ordering the final This cannot be missed

B000NQRE9Q|5.0|Indiana Jones is a Trilogy and one drug induced hallucination that takes a giant crap on everything that made the first 3 movies great.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|Loved the story. Kept your attention and is hard to put down. Looking forward to more books by this author.
0375704027|5.0|It was rather bizarre, at times I forgot to blink.. and it felt more like I was watching a movie and my body was going through the motions of reading.
B00A8MGLAI|4.0|Love it or hate it Cloud Atlas pulls off what no other movie (as far as I can find) has dared attempt. It is essentially six different stories spread out over a 500 year period intertwined throughout the running of the film. These stories and the cast within them are each connected in two ways. The first being the principal players are apparently reincarnations of the same person in each story. The second being the actions done in an earlier story influence the lives of another era. It's all a fascinating concept, and on paper it sounds like it would be an amazing achievement. Sadly it falls short of the grandiose concept. Still the movie is fascinating. Do I love it? No. Do I hate it? No. Do I regret seeing it? No. Why? Read on.<br /><br />I think the best way to get to the nuts and bolts of this film is to break up each individual story. While each of them are very different from each other a few things are common. First is the separate story in of itself if complete and aside from trivial details does not need the support of the other stories to stand on its own. Second is even though these are all complete stories with one exception they feel in way incomplete. Much more needed to be said and done in order for the stories to truly leave you satisfied on its own. I understand the limitations of squeezing six stories into three hours of running time, but it still is what it is. Another thing I found in common is every story has at one point or another has some really graphic violence. It doesn't matter if the theme of the story is dramatic of comedic or otherwise. Every one of them has a signature stamp of shocking violence on it. Now on to the stories, which I'll just denote by the time period.<br /><br />1849<br /><br />Adam Ewing (Jim Sturgess) is traveling the Pacific on business and on the way back befriends a runaway slave (David Gyasi). All the while he contracts a rare disease and is being administered by a physician along the way (Tom Hanks). It is a story about the virtues of loyalty and the complications of trust. Essentially just three sets with the first part being at a slave trade port, second being in a sailing ship, and a coda to tie off the loose ends at a Victorian home. The best parts are during the scenes on a large sailing ship, which all the virtues of the story come together. I think at least the first half of this story suffers the most by being broken up into parts throughout the film. More than any of the others I found myself having to do reach back into my memory in order to continue where this story left off. But by the time we get to the trip back the interweaving falls into place much better.<br /><br />1936<br /><br />A musician named Frobisher (Ben Whishaw) writes to his lover about his experience trying to reignite the talents of noted composer Vyvyan Ayrs (Jim Broadbent), while creating his own musical opus, The Cloud Atlas. This story is set in various cities around Great Britain and is a drama in every form.<br /><br />There is an aire of self serving confidence in Frobisher as he volunteers himself into the lives of the Ayrs (including bedrooms) all the while still writing away to his paramour. As many dramas before are it is ultimately a sad story of loss and emotional complication as best laid plans end up taking a turn for the worst. This story serves as a good change of pace from the more action oriented stories, and still keeps you held in interest over where the story turns.<br /><br />1973<br /><br />Set in San Francisco budding journalist Luisa Rey (Halle Berry) uncovers a sinister secret involving a newly opened nuclear reactor. This story has all the suspense of a good conspiracy theory styled action film. I have to admit this story feels a bit more complete than most others, but not enough to say it's a finished work with no need for expansion. Definitely has that 70's movie feel to it.<br /><br />Two standout performances aside from Berry come from two sides of the good/evilcoin. Keith David absolutely owns his role as security chief, or more akin to this story the cavalry. I would see a whole movie based off this character. On the other end is  hitman Mr. Smoke (Hugo Weaving), who is completely amoral and so evil to the bone you can't help but want to be in the fight against him.<br /><br />2012<br /><br />Set in the UK this story, even though it starts off rather harsh, end up being the comedic twist Cloud Atlas desperately needed to lighten an otherwise heavy storyline. Cavendish (Jim Broadbent) is a publisher with the unfortunately distinction of having a homicidal client kill a critic of his book. Cavendish ends up going into hiding after a run in with his client's cohorts over \\"royalties\\" and gets double crossed by his brother (Hugh Grant), who traps him in a crooked retirement home.<br /><br />The comedy gets a bit irky up until he joins a group of retirees in hatching a plan to escape. Then the story gets delightfully crazy and lighthearted; in contrast to it's beginning. Nice blend of the cast with a notable detail. I say notable because it's both entertaining and weird at the same time. Hugo Weaving plays sadistic Nurse Noakes, which is at first off-putting to see Hugo as a rather large and unappealing woman. As the story goes on I see the appeal of having such a caricature of a character. Of all the Cloud Atlas stories this is the one feels the most complete, and if you took this segment and made it into a half hour long short film it would stand on its own successfully. It also has the most fulfilling ending of all.<br /><br />2144<br /><br />It's Neo-Seoul and genetically engineered clones have become the new slave class. One clone, Sonmi~451 (Doona Bae) tells her story to an archivist (Hugo Weaving) of how she got liberated from her captor by a rebel commander (Jim Sturgess). The rebels then shows her the truth of her place and fate in society, and attempt to broadcast a manifesto spoken by Sonmi-451.<br /><br />This is the action segment of Cloud Atlas (and also where the sexual situations of the movie reside) so it is the most visceral of all the stories. It feels a lot like The Matrix in many ways without actually straight out plagiarizing the Wachowskis' previous work. As it sits alone the action is great and the story stands out as the fate of an entire class of people are in the balance. Still since it is mostly an action piece it loses a lot of depth and development on the second half of the piece. As a sci-fi fan I do admit this was the segment I adhered to the most.<br /><br />2321<br /><br />The date is not noted on the movie (just that it's 106 years after \\"the fall\\") until the end credits. Apparently the revolution from the 2144 took hold, but it appears society as a whole collapsed by an apocalypse of otherwise. All we see in this story segment are two groups. One highly advanced (although it seems the technology is at about the same level as 2144) called the Prescients and one primitive group living in the valley. The advanced group sends an emissary (Halle Berry) to the valley people to get a guide into uncharted mountains to a communications station to send a message to the colonies outside Earth. The guide, Zachry (Tom Hanks) has to juggle his superstitions and fears over the deadly Kona tribe with trust in his Prescient friend. All the while he is tormented by Old Georgie (Hugo Weaving), who is either a hallucination or malevolent spirit bent on breaking Zachry's will.<br /><br />As a standalone this is a story of vindication over fear and prejudice. In the whole this is the bookend for Cloud Atlas that kind of finishes the fate of all the souls who have jumped from era to era. As such it serves to finish the movie with a ray of hope. Again, this being a sci-fi genre piece it interested me. There is a good interpretation of the different cultures and how they know each other and learn to work together even though this story has a pretty depressing level to it.<br /><br />So how do all of these stories connect to each other other than the same actors playing different incarnations? The other connection I mentioned is really just a footnote that hardly seems to affect the fate that it supposedly influences. A letter or manuscript from a previous story is read on the next one, but the reading doesn't really seem to cause any paradigm shift in the story. You have one character that actually is in two different stories, but again this detail is not significant in of itself. Then on the final 2321 story it hints at how important Sonmi~451's manifesto from 2144 was, but again it doesn't serve any significance other than why she is significant as a person. To me this is where Cloud Atlas fails. It has six different stories that are connected somewhat, but those connections don't go anywhere other than as an interesting footnote for those paying attention.<br /><br />On the other hand I do find it interesting to see these various \\"lives\\" evolve through time. I think this is where the movie can get fascinating for those of you who like to analyze, theorize and philosophize over it. So I look at Tom Hanks' characters and see a slow move from a selfish and evil man in early incarnations, to somebody who wants to do what's right, but is afraid, to the final character to overcomes these selfish ways. Alternately I see the same in Hugo Weaving's character. He starts off as a man eager to get into the slave trade and pretty much sticks to being bad all the way up to his incarnation that experiences Sonmi's testimony and manifesto (I don't count his portrayal as Old Georgie as that was not a physical incarnation). This follows the philosophy of reincarnation where as the soul progresses through the many lifetimes the soul gets older and wiser depending on what decisions are made in the next lifetime. Some souls take longer than others to reach a certain level of enlightenment. In that little analogy, whether it was intended or not by the makers of the movie, makes Cloud Atlas all the more worth looking into.<br /><br />The mechanics of the film itself are top notch. Cinematography, costumes, sets, script, acting, music score, special effects, practical effects and a whole slew of other details are done with precision and a high level of quality. Each era you are in you really feel like you are in that era. The future eras may have been trickier with 2144 being a bit too far on the fantastical side, but 2321 did feel very real even for a made up time period. Makeup is essentially very good with certain times you will have a hard time figuring out if that is really your favorite actor under it. Then again there are some moments of weakness makeup wise. Some \\"old face\\" look more like make up than being natural. The Neo-Seoul segment had some awkward looking faces of non-Asian actors made to look Asian, although I can imagine that being attributed to a future of mixed nationalities and genetic variances to make it not seem so strange. Basically all of the production values hit home and on that front Cloud Atlas is a resounding success.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray looks great and the movie is encoded on a BD50 disk so there is very little risk of image compression from the three hour movie. The DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 surround sound is well balanced. Aggressive in the action scenes but clean and clear in the more dialog heavy parts. This Blu-Ray/Combo says it comes with Ultraviolet Digital Copy, but that's a little misleading. Any time you see Ultraviolet that usually means you don't actually have the digital copy on disk, but you have an authorization code to download one from the web. A small detail, but I think it's worth pointing out. As for the extra features I can't help but feel underwhelmed. While the back packaging makes it sound like you are getting a plethora of documentaries what you are really getting is little snippets. They are call focus point featurettes and all of them run under ten minutes (butin HD). Here's the breakdown:<br /><br />A Film Like No Other - This is a fluff piece. It's something akin to a promotional short that must have been floating around before the film was released. It mostly hosts interviews with cast and crew geared towards sounding like the making of the movie was a grandest undertaking of them all.<br /><br />Everything is Connected - Some behind the scenes footage along with clips from the film and interviews all geared toward pointing out the connections the stories have with each other.<br /><br />The Impossible Adaptation - Essentially a discussion with the directors and and author David Mitchell talking about the novel and what was done to adapt it into a novel.<br /><br />The Essence of Acting - Various actors talking about the different roles they played and what it took to make the essential changes with each character. I would have enjoyed more time and depth on this featurette as it really delves into the meat of what this movie is about to me.<br /><br />Spaceships, Slaves & Sextets - Discussions on mixing the six stories together into a single cohesive piece. It feels like already charted territory by now, but some new insights do come up now and then.<br /><br />The Bold Science Fiction of Cloud Atlas - Another fluff piece that focuses on the sci-fi stories and the development of these worlds. Not exactly anything you couldn't figure out yourself after watching the film.<br /><br />Eternal Recurrence: Love, Life, and Longing - Much like the previous featurette, only this one focuses on the romantic elements of the film. Again it feels like parroting what most viewers already find out while watching the film.<br /><br />There is a fair amount of overlap in the information and footage between these featurettes, which makes feel even more cheated that they couldn't get separate content for ten minute documentaries on a three hour movie that's supposed to have taken four years to make. And there are no audio commentariesfrom cast and crew. No deleted scenes (is any exist). Not even movie trailers or image stills. As far as extras are concerned the package is underwhelming.<br /><br />Cloud Atlas is definitely a movie I would recommend seeing, but I'm not by any means expecting you to love, or even like it afterwards. Still it's one of those films that no matter how you feel about it by the end is worth experiencing. For sci-fi fans I would have to call it required viewing for the same reasons. Love it or hate it this movie is a ground breaker. Should you buy it? Not until you see it first. This isn't one of those films you should jump headlong into a purchase without knowing what you're getting into. No amount of reviews you read will really tell you if you should buy it or not. Lord knows it's not worth buying for the extras. Rent it. Netflix it. Whatever. But try before your buy.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Although I found the book slow in the middle and had lots of confusing (for me) caracters, I still think it is one of his best! I have read all of the Jack Reacher books and it feels as if I know him, he's a friend and I always think that I know what he's going to do. This book had some surprising twists that made it very interesting. I'm ready for the next one! Thanks, Lee Child, for giving us Jack Reacher! (on another note: Tom Cruise is not Jack Reacher, but he did do a good job in the movie in spite of the fact that he is not big enough, wore too many clothes and had a car!)

B000RPCK1U|5.0|Tomorrow Never Dies was a very amazing action movie with a great plotline and another great job by the current James Bond actor.  What made it so good for myself was all the great one liner's done by Bond about the ladies he hits on, plus bonus points for the bike run ontop of the Chinese buildings.  Basic plot is Bond is trying to stop a media man who is power hungry and wants to control the whole world.  Another good point was some of the kill scenes the chopper, couple of the bad guys, and the best kill scene in my viewpoint was the main villian, if you have yet to see this Bond movie then buy it and see for yourself how the villian dies.  I look forward to more Bond movies and the choose which one is the best actor for James Bond and which movie overall is the best movie of Bond.  It will be a hard choice but I will wait until I own the whole set for all the Bond actors which off top of my head is six Bond actors, if I am wrong someone correct me with right figure.

B005F8CL1S|3.0|Cohen fans are passionate folks! I know \\"well matured\\" people who travel the country (U.S. in this case) to attend his shows, a rare phenomena for someone who is far from a rock idol!<br /><br />Complete collections like this are -- almost always -- sure to disappoint. Just recall the days when you had to purchase an entire record (or CD) just to get the few tunes you really wanted. For a revered songwriter/performer/poet like Cohen, this inevitable fact makes certain songs stick out like warts. You simply expected more of him...even close to 50 years ago. His early albums (particularly the abominable, regrettable and often unintelligible \\"wall of sound\\" partnership with Phil Spector) contain more than a few warts, but that is simply the down side of industry practices of throwing everything against the wall (NOT Spector's) to see what sticks.<br /><br />For most Cohen lovers, the more recent compendiums (e.g., Live in London) are likely to be much more satisfying.

1609611543|1.0|I was very disappointed and angered by Dr. Davis book, &#34;Wheat Belly&#34;.<br /><br />It is obvious that many people in our society are obese.  A person should try to look at the whole picture.  People that lived 100 years ago grew their own food, baked their own bread.  They were physically active, so burned a lot of calories.  Today's society has become sedentary from watching TV and spending hours on the computer.  If those obese people would take more walks, go to the gym, not go to all-you-can eat buffets they would benefit greatly.  Also if the obese people would use raw ingredients to prepare their own food, instead of boxed, prepared food, they would be healthier.<br /><br />A great, simple recipe for weight loss is eat less, move more.<br /><br />I grow much of our own food, we raise our own wheat, I bake our own bread, eat our own beef, milk, and eggs.  My cholesterol and blood pressure readings are an envy of my medical doctor.  I have no digestive issues.  We use our own whole wheat, that has not been processed and taken apart.  I am slightly overweight, but physically strong.  To blame wheat for many maladies in our society is disgusting!<br /><br />In the 1960's and early 1970's someone decided to fumigate wheat to eliminate bugs.  All of the wheat used in the U.S. today, except organic wheat, has been fumigated.  Is there a connection between the fumigation and wheat issues?<br /><br />Bread and baked goods that are produced in large, commercial bakeries often contain an array of chemical additives that are hard to pronounce.  Is this taken into consideration in solving the mystery of wheat issues in society?  There are good breads available without all the added chemicals.<br /><br />The wheat that we raise on our farm grows over three feet tall.  It has not been irradiated to make it short.  There are short varieties available, but we want the taller varieties as we use the straw on our farm.  Dr. Davis has drawn a lot of general conclusions about agriculture that are not accurate.<br /><br />So, Dr. Davis, we will continue to enjoy our good, chemical free wheat, fresh baked whole wheat bread and cookies.  You would envy our cholesterol and blood pressure readings.  It's too bad that you don't live on a farm like we do.  Maybe from the royalties you've earned on your book you can buy a farm and raise your own food, too!

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Wow! Just Wow! I just finished reading this book and loved it. The story was completely surprising. Wasn't expecting that at all. The author gets your attention from the first page and doesn't let go. The story was very original, intriguing, heartbreaking, emotional...I could go on and on. An emotional roller coaster. There are very few books that will cause your heart to beat faster. This is one of them. I loved how well developed the characters were and how believable. The story had a great flow and every scene made sense in telling the story. I will continue to read more books from Colleen Hoover. I just loved her writing style and creativity.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|I bought this book after watching the entire Netflix series and hearing Piper Kerman's NPR interview. The book was well-written - thoughtful, straightforward, funny, not fluffy.

Great read.

I have watch episode after episode nonstop since signing up, now into season 2 after a few days and still watching nonstop and I'm not one to watch television programs.  The plots, characters, and storylines are not wanting for anything and the actors and actresses are as real life as it gets.  After watching, I am once again sold on television after a very, very, very long time.  The Good Wife and Breaking Bad are my personal deal breakers for television viewing!!!

B00CFYAT6O|3.0|Although the lyrics are poetry the musical balance is downright clumsy.  The audio gain set for the drums and the horns is too high resulting in dilution of Tedeschi's vocal efforts.  It was almost as if the engineer was lost in the effort and gave up attempting to mix the tracks down a final package.  Too brassy for her vocals and too much pounding drum to hear the guitar.<br /><br />I went back and listened to other albums by Trucks with Tedeschi and the fault was absent.  Sometimes artistic effort is spoiled in the engineering booth by someone without finesse.  Too bad.  For all the fine efforts of individuals to be neutralized by an inept knob twister will keep this album of the play list.
B00BEIYMZ6|4.0|In truth, I'd have to rate We're The Millers as a something of an uneven comedy, parts of it being high comedy, parts of it being low comedy, and parts of it just being awkward and drawn out. But the film is rescued by a truly exceptional cast who are individually funny enough to keep things moving along nicely, even through the parts where the script and/or the director aren't quite up to the job.<br /><br />David Clark (Jason Sudeikis) is a low-level marijuana dealer who lives in an apartment building, as do Rose O'Reilly (Jennifer Aniston), who works as a stripper at a local club, and Kenny (Will Poulter), a genial but utterly clueless 18-year-old whose mother we learn apparently went out for groceries... a week ago.  Because of an incident caused by Kenny's trying to be helpful, David is robbed of his stash and his money, leaving him no way to pay his supplier to whom he owes a great deal of money. His supplier, a very wealthy drug boss named Brad Gurdlinger (Ed Helms) makes  David an offer he can't refuse:  smuggle \\"a smidgen\\" of marijuana from Mexico for him in order to clear his debt or his thugs will take it out of his hide. While gloomily contemplating how much trouble he's about to be in for, David gets an idea from seeing a cop deal with a goofy touristy family (think the Flanders family from The Simpsons) driving a hugely oversized RV through the neighborhood.  He realizes that while one man attempting to get through customs at the Mexican border would arouse suspicion, _nobody_ would expect a family that white-suburbanly goofy driving a ridiculously large RV of drug smuggling.  All he needs is a 'family' to provide the illusion.  He ends up drafting Kenny, who's innocently eager and has nothing else better to do; Rose, who's desperate after losing her stripper job and getting an eviction notice; and a teenage runaway acquaintance of Kenny's, a hard-edged girl named Casey (Emma Roberts) to pose as his bogus family whom he calls the \\"Millers\\".<br /><br />Everything seems to go well at first, in spite of personality clashes between David and Rose and between Casey and just about everyone (except Kenny, who's just too guileless for anyone to clash with).  But of course things quickly start to go wrong, starting with David finding out that the \\"smidgen\\" of marijuana he's supposed to pick up and smuggle turns out to be a thousand pounds that take up every inch of spare space in the RV. And that Brad was being somewhat less than honest on other matters of the deal, which ends up with the Mexican drug lord Chacon (Tomer Sisley) and his chief henchman, One-Eye (Matthew Willig) hot on their trail. With further complications added by another RV-traveling family they meet and then can't seem to get rid of, the Fitzgeralds, consisting of Don (Nick Offerman), Edie (Kathryn Hahn) and daughter Melissa (Molly Quinn).<br /><br />The comedy comes in varying forms, sometimes high-brow, sometimes low-brow, sometimes just makes-you-squirm awkward (note: this is definitely not a movie for younger kids), and sometimes the pacing is a bit off when a joke goes on for too long, but the superb cast keep things moving with great performances. Jason Sudeikis (Saturday Night Live, Horrible Bosses and Hall Pass) is perfect as David, the small-time marijuana dealer who's been thrown into situations completely out of his depth, talking confident but then freezing up with a deer-in-the-headlights look at the worst possible time. Jennifer Aniston (Friends, Horrible Bosses, The Switch) makes her stripper Rose more than a clich&eacute;, showing her to be quite resourceful in surprising ways, including being the only one to have read the RV's owners manual. Emma Roberts is surprisingly subtle as the runaway teenager Casey, giving her the comic hard-edges one would expect but every now and then letting her soften just a bit to make her character believable. Ed Helms (The Hangover trilogy, The Office) is delightfully over-the-top as David's manipulativeand screw-everyone-you-can-every-way-you-can supplier, Brad. The stand-out though is Will Poulter's Kenny, who comes across as the most white-bread white-boy in America (quite an achievement considering that Poulter's actually British) and time and again has the best scenes.  Poulter is largely unknown to American audiences, but he's done a lot of work in British TV and film, including the delightful but largely unknown Son Of Rambow (2007), and more recently The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader (2010) and Wild Bill (2011). Among other comedic gifts, Poulter is blessed with these incredibly arched eyebrows that let him look constantly surprised or confused, which fit the character perfectly. And he also knows how to throw in an unexpected curve as he does in one scene where Kenny out-of-the-blue starts rapping along - quite well - to hip-hop  TLC's \\"Waterfalls\\" which the group is listening to on the RV radio. You get the impression from the other actors' faces that this may have been entirely unscripted.<br /><br />The film also includes some blooper out-takes during the end credits which are definitely worth catching, particularly one where the crew evidently was playing a joke on Jennifer Aniston and another where Matthew Willig surprises Jason Sudeikis with a highly unexpected move.<br /><br />Recommended as worth seeing for the individual performances, especially Will Poulter, though with the note that this is most definitely not for the younger kids.rew-everyone-you-can-every-way-you-can supplier, Brad.

B008602KQI|4.0|I had read the book before I saw the movie and although there were some parts missing (not everything can go into the movie plot), I still enjoyed it. I guess I just like the character development and the plot.
B0085A9J18|4.0|I liked this movie because it is a little different than your typical martial arts movies.  It shows more of the fighting that depicts some of the penjak silat (Indonesia) and also showed a lot of the close quarter fighting in an urban setting.  It is both gory and realistic in some of the fight scenes.  Overall, it was a good movie.

0143124544|5.0|Such carefully drawn out characters! I felt immersed in their most intimate feelings and pain.  Not only in Will's, but in those of his parents as well.  Such a beautiful story. I anticipated the end, but still hoped for that rainbow.  Lou Clark is a fabulous, quirky heroine.  Her growth during the six months as the story unfolds, is one of personal triumphs which allows the reader to cheer for each of her successes.  Her reaching out to other quadriplegics via the Internet, and the support they gave her was very touching.  Nathan, the faithful nurse is a wonderful supporting character, as are Lou's varied family members. The book is marvelous and should not be missed, but be prepared to spend some time afterward reviewing your personal thoughts about dying with dignity.
B005LAIGTG|5.0|Such a wonderful love story. If you have never seen it, please watch it. It is so romantic. If you have seen it. You know what I'm talking about and you'll want to own it so you can watch it any time you feel like it. We should all be so lucky to fall in love like these two did.
B005544V6A|5.0|Love it! Have been hooked since i saw the first episode. My new favorite series to binge on. Awesome , recommend watching!
0345536886|5.0|I really loved this book, the plot, the way the story has been narrated and the characters profiles. I also appreciated the sight into the American legal system and in particular into the federal jury trial.<br /><br />Grisham is always the best.
0374533555|5.0|I'm officially a psychology fan. This book should be read by all economists, but it's also an excellent reading for everybody else.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I like this and it comes in handy when you want to watch long videos on YouTube. It takes a little bit of time to start short videos which makes it a waste of time.
B0002O7XW2|4.0|Good &#34;horror&#34; classic from the 80's.  Not near as suspenseful as I remember but still a good flick.  Thumbs up!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is really good. It is gust like the other minecraft on computer and pc<br />My brouther started playing minecraft on the xbox. So I played on my kindle.
B008469DGY|2.0|Downloaded as a free app of the day and found the game to be less like Golf and more like a frustrating game of washers or horseshoes. In the game you flick your ball towards the green in the hopes of getting a hole-in-one. This is a very important detail, because if you can't master getting holes-in-one you won't unlock levels or advance. The green in divided into point rings like a target, but any points but the center ring are fairly useless. You are able to \\"control\\" your ball during its flight which would be useful if you could tell where the ball was going to land. There are many times while I was playing this that I thought I had overshot the green, so I began trying to control my ball to go back, only to find that had I done nothing I would have most likely have hit center. Now I've knocked my ball off course and am struggling to get it back where I wanted it while its in the air on a bounce, which is almost pointless. The game runs really well on my phone and it looks nice, its big drawback however is that its more than a little frustrating to try and play. My hats off to anyone who enjoys this and is good at it. You get nine shots to make your score in order to advance; getting center green is 500 points and a hole in one is a 1000 (There are other bonus points for putting back spin on the ball and hitting the pin and whatnot) so if you need 10,000 points to unlock the next level you can do the math and figure out what its going to take cut the mustard. Good luck.
B00CLT31D6|5.0|I will probably reread the book again because it was so informative and so very true. Most of the millionaires featured in the book have the same principles that may generations from the 1930's and 1940's had and sadly our current generation does not have.
B00C8USQEM|1.0|Every one should know my set was defective.  Season 3 and 4 disk defective, won't play.  Waiting to see how refund or replacement goes, will post again.
B004XZR63M|5.0|I will recommend this book to my family as it is very good advise for young and old it is always a good idea to know a lot about the different forms of wealth building the author presents it in an easy and fun way.
0321934962|5.0|You know a lot of these sorts of books are written with the techno-geek in mind and sure I want to learn about all the cool features my new camera has on it...but come on...tell me how to use it like a normal human being.  This book and this series does just that. The writer does not pretend to cover all the stuff in the Nikon user manual but he does say he wants to give you enough information and learn a few techniques that will get you from being a total newb to taking shots that say, &#34;I'm actually learning something here.&#34; The author starts of with 12 tips to make your shooting more productive right out of the box. Can you dig that sort of things out of the user manual...sure. But he tells you why you may want to do these things, how to do them and how to get it back the way it was if you decide later you don't like it.  Things like setting correct white balance, turning off Auto ISO setting, turning beeps off and on, formatting discs,..good stuff...and a good book particularly for those of us who have frankly bit off a little more camera then they can chew.
B000063V8U|5.0|This is a very welcome addition to my library!  I have been adding these a year at a time for a while--decided to splurge.  Glad I did!
B006LSZECO|5.0|As other readers have said,  it is a page turner, but the ending is a thought provoker.  After reading the end, one tries to think up a different way to conclude the situation and yet maybe after all it is left as the right solution.

B000AJIF4E|5.0|My DJ friend recommended these headphones. I wear a 7 7/8&#34; hat (XXL). Most places don't even sell them that big. I read multiple reviews that these headphones are pretty tight, so I was worried, but I got them anyways. They feel GREAT. I have no idea what these people are talking about.<br /><br />-I put them on full blast and my co workers say they can't hear a thing.<br />-They feel great on my ears<br />-They sound great<br />-I don't look like a D-Bag
B0036T31YY|5.0|this was a cool movie. I was afraid it would be more of a horror movie, which I hate. I hate bloodly slasher flicks, no matter how \\"cutting edge\\" people try to tell me the \\"best ones\\" are. this was more along the lines of a psych-thriller, for people that loved donnie darko, which was good but not too complex. more along the complexity of primer or timecrimes or time travel film of that kind of complexity. I didn't find it \\"un-followable\\" like some said on imdb, though I am sharper than most. I call this kind of movie as the few others like it a \\"perfect circle\\" in that they create a time loop perfectly. (SPOILER ALERT IN A VAGUE WAY), though when the movie starts you don't realize that you are already within the loop (like the masterful film primer). you aren't seeing it from point a to z, more like point g to r, or something. I find my review amongst 200 plus others little more than an exercise in why I liked it. that being said, if you love time travel films, love dark films, this is a darkly delicious treat.

B000SEGUDE|5.0|I still don't completely buy the notion that D. Mitchell originally intended for his six short stories to fit together the way they do, but whatever the case may be, the book is solid and he made it all work together brilliantly. One of the things I enjoyed the most was how the style of writing, down to the vocabulary, changed from one story to the next. I also enjoyed the hints dropped here and there of how simple everyday little details would grow into major problems later on in history (particularly as they relate to corporatism, the abuse of technology and greed). I can't say that I have a favorite part/epoch/short story but the Sonmi451 and Kona tales were outstanding examples of science fiction done right, and I enjoyed them perhaps a little more than the rest.<br /><br />The differences between the book and the movie make both versions work in their own right, which is also nice. If you have seen the movie, the book will seem familiar without being too repetitive, and you will be surprised - in a good way - by some of the differences. Five stars, thumbs up, and a big warm reco for this novel. Instant classic IMO.
B0050IY61G|5.0|All of my questions were answered. The author has unquestionable expertise. The book takes all of the confusion and mystery out of Aspergers and sets the reader on an intelligent and realistic path.
B00EI6E17A|4.0|It's a good song, but I would think the first release from the new upcoming album would have been a little more interesting...
0634014331|4.0|I like the format and the musical works are nicely done.  The only problem is in opening the book itself to play the pieces.  Perhaps the publisher could arrange for the book to open more easily in another edition.

B00B999E12|5.0|I had a friend tell me about this movie and looked at reviews and the trailer for it. I saw that Mike Patton set the music for the sound track so I was surely going to get the sound track!
B004EPYZU8|5.0|At first I wasn't sure if I would like this movie but as I watched it I started to like it more and more but see at first it was kinda lame and weird but it got a whole lot better as the movie progressed so its worth buying

B0089LOG02|5.0|I didn't want to read this, but my friend made me.  I'm sooo glad she did.<br />I had not heard of the Orphan Trains - didn't know they existed.  The<br />story is NOT all doom and gloom - and parallels our modern situation beautifully.<br />Where are the &#34;orphans&#34; of today?
140006922X|3.0|There are those who believe that the bible and the New Testament in particular is the unalterable Word of God. For those people this book and similar questions about Jesus are not relevant. For others however, the basics of Christianity formulated in the Nicene Creed in the fourth century come into question. Historically almost nothing is known about the man Jesus. What we know comes from the gospels and these were written long after the death of Jesus by people who had never met or even seen Him. It is reasonable to assume that if there were someone going around raising people from the dead, walking on water and healing the sick, lame and blind that surely something of this would have found its way into the historical record; but it did not.<br />Mr. Aslan really does not (in my opinion) shed any new light on the conflict between history and faith. He does do a good job in describing the environment in which the life of Jesus took place, and the political and cultural conflicts of the times. There are no revelations in this book but some worthwhile reading for anyone interested in the subject.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|I found this book to be very interesting and thought provoking.  I plan to read it again very soon as I believe I can get more out of it the second time around.  This book actually deepened my belief in Jesus The Christ.

B003YL4LYI|5.0|I've read all five now, and of them all, ADWD has to be the greatest of all, yet also the most frustrating. I feel bereft, as though hundreds of people I knew had suddenly been vanquished from the Universe. And so many whose fates are still unknown! Martin, get thee back to the writing sept for you have much work to do, else I'll give you your own golden crown!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Felt so real in my head while reading this book. First book I have read in a short period of time.
B006LSZECO|3.0|The first half of the book was slow.  Alternate chapter of his vs her points of view.  The last half was exciting and very clever The end seemed like the publisher had given her a deadline that would not be moved so she had to wrap it up quickly.  Gone was the clever and creative writing!
B0073QQ3X2|5.0|I recently purchased the Apatosaurus for my grandsons 4th birthday.  He it totally into dinosaurs.  As always the &#34;Schleich&#34; brand is very well made and realistic looking.  It is very good quality.  He got several dinosaurs for his birthday, but he said this one was his favorite.  He wanted to sleep with it that night.  I would highly recommend this product and any of the &#34;Schleich&#34; brand products!

B00D8RYV52|1.0|My son loves the Dr. Panda games but this one is SO boring. Fill the car with gas, vacuum it, wash it and customize are all that you can do, and even then. Nothing mechanical in the least, I was expecting him to actually have \\"tools\\" to take off tires, mess around under the hood, stuff that I've come to expect from these games but not this one. Even the free Dr. Panda games are more interesting and far more educational. This one is a dud, wish there was more to do I feel like the money paid was a total waste. DO NOT BUY THIS APP!

B007SUW24W|5.0|Ed Sheeran is a breath of fresh air. If you have not heard his music, you should give it a listen. He is a very gifted song writer and his delivery is exquisite and he is remarkably unique.
B001AEF6BI|5.0|This is a movie that needed to be made.  Thank you, John Hughes, may you rest peacefully.  The genius of The Breakfast Club is still intriguing as it was in 1985.  Every character owns and embodies the stressful period of teenage life beautifully.  The standout to me in this film will always be Anthony Michael Hall.  His character is humble, reaching, relatable and real.  Great story and a wonderful cast.  This film takes you to a place where you are grateful for this thing called evolution.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|This book tugs on parts of your soul that have been asleep for ages.  It's magical how words can awaken things long forgotten.<br /><br />I can't properly review this book as I don't think a trite review does the subject matter justice.  I read the book in one sitting.  It was fantastic.  A short read but a very rewarding read.  I hope these words encourage someone else to read this book as I have.  I believe it will stay with you forever as a good story should.
B000MZHW40|4.0|Finally a movie with great actors and story line to show the world a glimpse of the effects of supply in demand in places \\"far away\\" from the comfort. Must see should impact the way you view diamonds.
1451662432|5.0|I am neither a movie fan nor a muscle guy admirer.  I am a middle aged female and I bought the book because as a Californian, I appreciated \\"Arnie\\" as governor.  Overall the book was a pleasant surprise: it was very funny and also warm and human.  I found I became interested in a lot of the details of his life.  Born in a small town in a defeated country to a middle class family, Arnie had a dream and a vision from a very young age and was determined to succeed.  He picked something he was naturally good at to start: body building, and used that to follow his dream to America and, like many less famous but equally successful immigrants, made good by hard work.  It is true he had some natural attributes that the average person does not have (like a body that responded to the \\"reps\\" without serious injury) but I appreciated the story that hard work got him where he wanted to go and there are no short cuts to success.  While the degree of his success eclipses most people, the story was engaging and the diversity of his success from body building to business to acting to public service to politics really is remarkable.  He gives appropriate credit to people who helped him including his famous in-laws, the Kennedys. It's kind of sad what happened to his marriage but he doesn't blame anyone other than himself.<br />I thought he was a pretty decent governor and being in the center myself, appreciated someone who would try to work with both parties to accomplish goals for the people of the state.<br />I'm guessing a lot of the \\"1 star\\" reviewers are seriously jealous.  I think the average person will really enjoy this book.

B00A8MGIZG|1.0|I saw the previews and did not rent first before I bought this video.I usually rent a dvd before I decide whether to buy or not.But I didn't like this movie ONE BIT!Unusual I thought considering Tom Hanks stared in this one.I think there was some content that could have been left out.
B0028IDXDS|5.0|I highly recommend getting new babies a Wubbanub!  My daughter was always waking up in the night because her pacifier would fall out.  All we had to do was replace the pacifier and she fell asleep instantly.  Once we bought this, she was able to put the pacifier in her mouth on her own.  The extra body helps the baby develop those hand motor skills.<br /><br />I was originally worried about this thing on her face and SIDS but it is smaller than a Beanie Baby so it is really a non-issue.  It's also very cute to see the babies with this in their mouth.  My friends' kids have them too and love it.

1419705644|5.0|It's not the kind of &#34;the art of...&#34; book, but it's equally as awesome because the storyline is written from the viewpoint of hunson abadeer, and then there's finn, jake and marceline's little voices inside the book too. This encyclopaedia is almost personal, really worth the money if you love adventure time! :)

B009MYARIK|1.0|I've read all of Sophie Kinsella's books. They're usually light-hearted and fun to read but is one was a bit too silly. Not really sure how it could be improved. It just may be that her books have run their course with me.

B0089LOG02|3.0|Loved the history behind the book.  Hooked me from the beginning. I plan to recommend as a read for my book club.
B002G1YPH0|1.0|I bought this due to the popularity and overall good reviews.<br /><br />There are a TON of things wrong with this cooler that I'm very surprised it has the rating it has.<br /><br />1.  LOUD!!!!!  At full RPM's this thing is unbelievably noisy.  I'm running at 40-50% speed just to keep it at the same noise level as the rest of my fans.<br /><br />2.  The plastic clip-on mounts for the fan warp if tightened too much and won't allow fan to clip to cooler properly.  Pretty flimsy setup if you ask me.  Plus they hide the screws under the rubber cushions so to flip the fan around you run the risk of your cushions losing their stickiness.<br /><br />3.  The mount is horrible.  The bolts/nuts chewed into my motherboard when tightening, even without over-tightening.  Luckily not enough to cause issues but worrisome.<br />-Even when fully tightened the cooler is able to move(slide).  It's not much but seemed like a very bad thing for it to do.<br /><br />4.  4 of 8 of the copper tubes at the top were crunched.  Not sure if they're supposed to be like this but if they are it's a very stupid looking design.  Not really noticeable but just made me think even less of the cooler.<br /><br />5.  SIZE!!!  I put this last for me but could be a big issue for some.  On my setup I can't run RAM in the 1st slot with the fan on the front side as I assume a lot of motherboards will be the same.  I ended up just using slots 2/4 instead.  SO...if you plan on running 4 sticks of RAM or your motherboard requires slot 1 to be used you'll have to move the fan to the rear...and that eliminates any possibility of running dual fans if you wanted to.<br /><br />6.  Instructions.  Some of the worst I've ever seen.  Vague pictures that you don't know if it's for your setup or not.  Written instructions that basically say install and use.<br /><br />Overall I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.  There has to be better quality and fitting coolers out there.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I truly enjoyed the book.  My only concern would be to what level reads it.  I understand the girl is 16 and has a limited life but sex at that age seems a bit unsettling for the audience this book is geared toward.
0345803485|1.0|To start, let me tell you that I have yet to finish the entire book. With that said, I decided after reading many other reviews to share my own thoughts on it. Seven chapters in and I can tell you there is nothing appealing about the male \\"sex god\\" protagonist Christian Grey. Sure, he is described as tall, extremely handsome, and a billionaire. But he is very arrogant. He says he buys Ana these $14,000 novels simply because \\"he can\\" and that's his answer every time his immense amount of money he has is brought up. He spends it because he can.<br /><br />Chris also is super controlling, which Ana does see and comments on, calling him a control freak in her inner voice, but clearly she is too blinded by his sex god appearance to give two craps. He is obedient towards her and just reading it makes me hate his character. You can tell he doesn't truly care about her at all, he just likes to have someone to control. He forces her to eat stating he doesn't like wasting food....maybe he shouldn't have bought her everything on the breakfast menu when shes a very skinny girl. And the fact he clearly has the money to spare makes it annoying that he says that.<br /><br />This book clearly has its connections to Twilight, which it should since it started out as a fan fiction of the novel. She is constantly referring to the fact that he doesn't talk like he is really 26. She is always saying \\"he finally was acting his age\\" blah blah blah....it is a very poorly written Twilight based book, just adding lots of sex and taking away the vampire aspect.<br /><br />Did I mention I haven't even reached any of the crazy sex parts of the book yet??? I will continue on for now, just to read what the hype is about, but knowing he beats her and inflicts some serious pain on Ana, I have a feeling I will not be finishing this book or the other 2.
B00D6QUJ6U|5.0|The Blu Ray is so nice to have!  There are camera shots you'd never see on the DVD.  Colors also pop out!<br /><br />I don't know how many times I've played this Blu Ray!  Much more than the DVD, although I still play it as well.<br /><br />Many songs on this that are so wonderful to re-watch over and over are:  Alone, Massachusetts, Still Waters, Closer Than Close (lead by Maurice Gibb), How Deep Is Your Love, Medley which includes 2 songs I've loved forever:  I Can't See Nobody, And The Sun Will Shine.<br /><br />Wonderful all around for any fan of Bee Gees or knows of Robin or Barry Gibb's solo career.

B008VI0A2G|5.0|There were a lot of great songs, good variety, considering the age STILL sounded good!<br /><br />I would recommend this to a new fan of Elvis to get them acquainted with the King Of Rock and Roll or any member of a family who just loves Elvis!
B00BHU9BV6|2.0|I feel asleep during this movie. Couldn't understand the movie, wasn't interested enough to continue to watch or keep myself awake.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Compelling book. Creepy view of America's future. What will happen next who knows. Seven more words required to leave a five star rating
B00BHU2A7I|4.0|I liked this movie--it was good, Anthony Hopkins plays a great Hitchcock and his wife is even better. Good movie.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|This book is haunting in its depiction of Afganistan, a place I will never go to but that I feel like I know very well now after reading this sad book of hardships and overall triumphs! He is a profound author!!
B00ESY7QXI|4.0|Great movie, great music. Leo DiCaprio is awesome and plays a really good Gatsby. Just as good as the book and original movie.
B002GMSMHS|4.0|I have no problem with this memory card. It's compatible with my Olympus camera and DL easily into my hard drive.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun game. Makes you use your brain my 6 year old and I do it together and have a blast.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Love playing Spider somewhere other than my home PC and will add another game soon!!  Stilling learning all the many functions of the Kindle.
B000002GVO|4.0|Good replacement for the vinyl copy i have owned for decades. A nostalgic trip to a more sympathetic time past.
1451626096|5.0|I have read most of Gregory's books, was glad to stumble onto this one while ordering school textbooks, book arrived quickly and  was in great condition.<br />I like that you can &#34;look inside&#34; some of the titles while shopping.
B00062IDCO|3.0|I was disappointed with the item one of the sleeves that held a disc was broken and one of the clips that held one of the discs were broken the discs were okay and played fine
B00ET47USI|5.0|It is a great twist on an already challenging game. The graphics are phenomenal.  The animation is invitingly friendly. Thank you.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I found it a gripping story.  Sometimes I wished for a family tree as the chapters went from one member to another.  Never-the -less I enjoyed immensely and picked it up to read in every spare moment.
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|I love the graphics. The colors are wonderful. The music is very soothing. I find the puzzles very challenging and mind consuming helping me to relax. I like how the challenger puzzles at the end of each group is slightly less hard, but still makes me think. It was also great that it can be switched from right to left handed.
1451695195|5.0|The fact that this was written by a neurosurgeon is what made it believable.  I had always heard of people &#34;passing through&#34; but, like Dr. Alexander, was skeptical.  However, his in-depth explanation of the total experience and the profound effect it had on him was so convincing.  I have lost people dear to me and this was very helpful.  In fact, I got copies for friends of mine who were currently going through a painful loss in hopes that it would also help them.  (I have not had any feedback from them as of this time.)  It was truly worth every minute.
B000001FK3|4.0|The late JJ Cale's early seventies gem of an album.  You can imagine this album inspiring a young Mark Knopfler to take up guitar and plot his own path to musical stardom.  Highlights include 'After Midnight' (covered by Eric Clapton two years earlier), 'Crazy Mama', 'Call Me The Breeze' and the gentle beautiful  'Magnolia'.  With its simple laidback arrangements, the album is a blend of country rock and blues that works very nicely.
B003NHRIVQ|5.0|This is a really good love story. My favorite part of course is at the end when they end up together!
1444710338|5.0|This is my 3rd time ordering this book, each time I order one of my friends will take it. I had great results following the diet in this book.
0312330537|4.0|Very well written. Engaging story and remarkable characters. Takes you back in time if you are from Mumbai or have spent time in the city in the 80s
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love the fact that you can buy books right from the Android app (you couldn't do this from the iPhone app).  I've already gotten two new books.  I'm very happy with this app.
B005MYEQ4U|4.0|Midnight in Paris presents as a bit of a chick flick. If you appreciate art, art history, or literature, it's actually quite enjoyable. Above all, it makes me want to go to Paris.
B008220AVW|5.0|This very personal look into the life of artist Katy Perry during her tour, marriage and breakup from husband Russell Brand is almost too much information. The emotional roller coaster of Ms. Perry's life mirrors her music and still her fans love and support her. It's almost like seeing the man behind the curtain, killing the illusion of success equals happiness. For the concert sequences I would hardily recommend this to anyone. For those who want to keep the mystery alive I suggest skipping this one and buying The Smurfs.
B005S9EK5Y|4.0|It's nice to have a reminder like this that some of the Hollywood elite actors that we collectively pay millions to go see actually have talent that makes them worth seeing. Well done adaptation of the musical. It won't make you like musicals, but it will give you a greater appreciation for Hugh Jackman as something other than wolverine.
B009ZZDNT6|3.0|Only used it a few times, but alarm came on with my choice music at my choice of time.  .Has many features. Like choice if weather
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I started with just the free version to see if I really liked it before I bought it. The free version is wonderful and has a lot of sounds that you can use to create your own sounds to meditate or sleep to. I bought it to help with sleep and I couldn't be happier.<br /><br />The upgraded package has over 90 different and unique sounds that you can combine in any way you want. Each sound has it's own volume adjustment so you can really make it unique. My favorite sounds are Melody, Butterfly, and Cat Purring. For some reason, when you put them together I find it soothing and it helps me sleep.<br /><br />Over the last year I have tried several different types of music to sleep to and a few programs now and this is by far my favorite. I have used it every night this week and I plan to keep using it in the future. I highly recommend either version, but the purchased version doubles the content available and is definitely worth the investment.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Third time is still a charm! I'm still in love with Gideon!  Such a beautiful love story, I'm so glad she finally realized what he would do for her!
B008OOYALE|2.0|I can't honestly rate this game by the play because I wasn't able to play for more than ten minutes before this game froze my Kindle Fire. I had to reset the whole thing. Since my Kindle hasn't frozen in the entire year I've owned it this was very upsetting to me. The game seemed cute but I'm not going to risk my Kindle Fire over an app.
0897502027|5.0|The immortal Bruce Lee.<br /><br />Been searching for this book for the longest time. I think first time I added this to my cart was last year and it always had the comment &#34; we will inform you once the book is available&#34;.<br /><br />Great read!
B004X4R49Y|5.0|Very entertaining.  Good family movie.  Watched it with my 10 year old daughter and we all loved it.  Glad it was available on Amazon Video for rental.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|This is a really great file explorer app for kindle fire hd. I use this program frequently for school and it keeps things organized.
B008NB2GI2|5.0|Ms. Penman has a huge range of charactors spread over 33 years and my hero, Richard III, as it's main star.  Somehow I never felt lost or lost sight of even the minor players, because she tied all of them together so simply and with such great thoughtfulness that each and every one of them felt core to the whole novel.  The book will be one of my favorites, to be read over and over again.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|My recent purchase of this item is a great disappointment! After many tries it finally loaded to my computer and to the TV. Now it says it is ready to &#34;cast&#34;. Not only does it not tell me what casting is but there is absolutely no one to ask. It is now hanging off the back of my TV - unusable.  Horrible customer service as well as a junk product.
0767836324|5.0|The movie &#34;Hook&#34; was great, with a great cast (especially Robin Williams), and it made a really good 'sequel' to &#34;Peter Pan.&#34;  It is a 'feel-good' movie, worth watching again.
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|I like this game alot. It keeps you entertained and excited for the next level. It gets harder each level, but I like that.
0345803493|5.0|cant wait to read the last one this one was awesome!!! love it love it love it love it !
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I loved this book so much! It is so interesting. I personally think the book is better than the movie because more things happens and it almost makes you wish they would make a movie just like the book. I gave this book a five star rating because it is so wonderful. I would recommend this book to anybody.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|pass the time with this game. some games are a bit.more difficult than others, but still fun nonetheless. worth the download.
B009T8XBBO|5.0|Was suprized to find this game to be as fun as it is.Just keep on going and going.Keeps me occupied and entertained as well..
B00BQH9SY0|5.0|Unique sound, amazing lyrics, sweet beats..... what's NOT to love!!! Listening to the whole cd was pretty rad.... like all the songs, but maybe one. I would really dig seeing The Neighbourhood in concert!!! :)
B0023SDPS6|5.0|I am a fan of the Longmire TV Series. I thought I'd try the first book in the series. The book is great with much better character development than the TV series. I live in a rural part of Montana so many of the characters feel like my neighbors. I look forward to reading the entire series. It is a must for all fans of the TV series.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0023SDPS6 The Cold Dish: A Walt Longmire Mystery (Walt Longmire Mysteries)]]
B00B2V66VS|3.0|The graphics are pretty good and I love the boost upgrades. The characters are cool too. Nice job Imangi Studios.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I like that I can use the app on my kindle. It even has little games if that's what you like.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|Beth Kantner this novel is both a simple story and a deep proverb. A cosmic novel with good and evil set on a rural farm or was that an ocean?
B0079R8KO0|4.0|This is a good, attractive and sturdy all-purpose case for Kindle and I am pleased with my purchase. I can recommend it.
B005FFW46S|5.0|Pratchett never fails me! When life gets you down the disc is a great brain vacation spot. Can't wait for the next
B009K0P10K|5.0|can't stop watching!!! so many twists and turns and really keeps me guessing. it was even better than season one.
B00A6L78YE|5.0|I bought this album on a whim after hearing a bunch about Foxygen during SXSW. I was definitely not disappointed! Foxygen combines a Dylan-esque folky sound with light-hearted, poppy lyrics. It's very whimsical and easy on the ears. Great new music!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is by far the best book I've ever read. I couldn't put the book down. I finished it all in one day
B00B9366VO|5.0|Great documentary; I really enjoyed it. Recommend watching it especially rock fans. I just like it. it was good. awesome.
B0071XO8RA|3.0|Appreciated the story concept and was mildly entertained by the technical descriptions even though they went on too long.  Some of the characters came off to flat as persons in a closed world and some of the plots' unfoldings were labored and a bit shallow.  But the questions of character, survival, community, leadership were worth the read.
B003G4W49C|4.0|Definitely loved the plot twist just wish it would have happened sooner in the book. Can't wait for the movie
B0013LL2Z2|5.0|I first saw this as a child and was very blown away by this sci-fi- thriller. Its set way in the future in a society living in a domed- utopia, where the balance of life is kept by letting people &#34;re-new&#34; on their 30th birthday.  They are carefree and dont know about &#34;outside&#34; and are not allowed to grow old.  Logan is a &#34;Sandman&#34; whos job it is to hunt down runners, and is given the task to find over 1000 runners who have run away to &#34;Sanctuary&#34;...and so the story goes...  this is a must see for anyone who likes sci-fi.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game. Very entertaining, action packed, and just fun to play. I find this more addicting then Candy Crush!
B001AVCFJM|5.0|This movie explains the relationships of the Enterprise crew and is a pre-quel to the 60s series. I have fallen in love with these early characters, any Star Trek fans must have this for your collection!
B009LK6JS2|5.0|The graphics are great, controls are easy and intuative... I just hope they continue to come out with more aircraft to fly/purchase!  Or maybe even new locations?
B00CUWWLWG|3.0|you need to able to upgrade your storage more often. if you. could do upgrades more often then I would give this app a higher rating
0670026603|5.0|Thank You Jojo Moyes - what a very special read, pure sensitivity & very close to my heart - a never forget story ...
B00A0MJ9ZA|5.0|My decision to buy this blu ray version of &#34;Disney's Peter Pan&#34; concerns the option to watch the film with optional Disney View.<br />I always like to play older 4:3 Disney animated picturesto watch with the additional background paintings left and right on the screen.<br />We don't have Peter Pan in Europe in this Version.
0762434279|1.0|This book is about 2.5&#34; by 2&#34;! My daughter had read the &#34;real&#34; book and recommended it for my boyfriend. He opened it before I got home and thought it was a joke. Perhaps you can imagine my daughters hurt when she asked him about it and got laughed at! This ruined my faith in ordering things from Amazon!!!
B000002H92|5.0|I have downloaded and purchased a few complete Doors shows but the best buy for your $$ is this compilation that combines the Doors' Absolutely Live and Alive She Cried. Highlights for me would be The Doors' rendition of Van Morrison's Gloria, and the full version of Celebration Of The Lizard, the live Light My Fire is also a real standout in this collection. Recommended.
B000QFQE4U|3.0|kind of long and took forever to get to the malcom x part. It was more about his life before he became muslim. the book was better
B00BRUQ7ZY|3.0|A fairly readable, accessible book that I read only because, like many others, I saw the awful Fox News interview with the author. I also like to read and respond to controversial books. The buzz around this book really highlights the large chasm that exists between the theologically educated and the average Christian. As someone who has been through seminary and is familiar with New Testament scholarship, this book was unremarkable and largely felt like a review. But any average church-goer who picks up this book will get the wind knocked out of them. This is a highly basic book, a sort of \\"Historical Jesus 101\\" type of work that was probably written for a general audience. But I'm not sure why that's needed. The book is written almost as if something like it has never been written for the public before, but that's far from the truth. The author, upon investigation, is not even actually a biblical scholar. His Ph.D is in Sociology.<br /><br />Most readers of this book probably don't have the tools, knowledge, or attention span to notice the points at which the author's conclusions are questionably argued. For example, there is a lack of consistency in which passages the author deems historical. He claims, like most real NT scholars, that the Gospel of John is the least historical of the four, but there are several instances where he unquestioningly assumes that some quote or event from John happened without giving a reason. As another example, he grants historical credibility to the stoning of Stephen in Acts 7 but not to the story of Jesus before the Sanhedrin, but uses the same historical evidence about Jewish capital punishment authority to argue both.<br /><br />Nevertheless, for the kind of book it is and what it aims to do, it's a well-written and highly accessible book, but I give it three stars because of the issues noted above and because the author really don't say anything new that hasn't been published by historical Jesus scholars in the last few decades.s.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|Man since i got this game i have not been able to put it down. I love it on the kindle the graphics are phenomenally awesome.
B0053Q9DHW|4.0|There is just something about British themed movies that I love. This was no exception. I have never read the story so I viewed this with no expectations and with fresh eyes. I thought the acting was good. The plot was complex and I hurt for the hero and heroine. I did love the ending. Now I want to read the book. Oh, and there were several places where I just about jumped out of my chair when stuff happened in that house. The love story was good and even though the end was sad, it was satisfying.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|best game I could ever download for my little cousins and other young family member who comes over for Sunday dinner... Thanks
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this fun little game. I think of it as a way robot only occupy my time but to keep my mind sharp. Thanks for the free version. I will purchase the others.
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|fun but hard. challenges the mind at some point through out the game. it is a time passer if and when you might be bored.
1451627289|5.0|Its a great book and it is helping a lot for the course I am taking. Thank you very much!
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I like it cuz I sleep right by my kindle fire . Don't have to get all the way out of the bed
