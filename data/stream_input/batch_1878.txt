B000089RVX|5.0|Enter the dark world of Fallen which was released shortly after 911 Twin Towers destruction.

'I won't let you bring me down'.<br /><br />Find Fallen, own it, and cry with millions of fans around the world. Listen. Find hope {:^)>
B006ATJXQW|4.0|The book it self was good. Probably a little more intense than the last three but still enjoyable, although it didn't give much new information. All I have to say is I really hope there is another book that comes next.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|This helps me sleep like a rock!  I love mixing all the versions of the rain.  I recommend this for anyone with sleep problems or just relaxing.  Zzzzzzz.
B0070Y46UY|3.0|Took a while to get into, then by the time I did, it was over. the story is a great one, but awfully sad
B003CJMPIG|2.0|Quite a bloody film.  It was kind of what I expected, but I wasn't as excited about it as I had hoped.  I found the flashbacks to his childhood more interesting than the rest of the film.  It was entertaining though.  Glad I only rented it instead of buying it.
B00AHSINKO|4.0|It was funny and beside a few unnessesary foul word, that truly were not needed, I thought it was a good movie.
B0063IH60K|4.0|You never win in the random and always win in the other. I like the game on my computer better as you win sometimes it seems more real.
B001B2CPH2|5.0|Great flic......funny, sad and beautiful.....
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Although it is very easy read it still grabbed my attention and I read it in just a  Few hours.
B0043JDUNS|5.0|Title says it all.<br /><br />However, to elaborate, I believe the Iron Man™ series has only gotten better throughout it's span. The first one was a great &#34;How it all started&#34;. Action, acting, graphics, and plot was all done very well (In Part 1). Part 2 was no exception. I expected more and received just that. I've watched this movie many times and I probably will come back for more and possibly watch the entire set when Iron Man 3 hits Theaters!<br /><br />++Definite Recommend!<br /><br />-K
B00A757EFW|4.0|This game can get very addictive...LOL. I loved this game when I was younger ad now this is a quick, easy and fun game. Doesn't take a lot of time but it is fun!
B00A9X7X6C|5.0|This movie was &#34;given away&#34; by the trailers, however it still had the action I expected as well as an unexpected twist to the plot. Good Movie through and through, would watch again.<br /><br />-K
B001U3Y5XE|5.0|A complete set! Ideal for those who like to create, design and play with legos ... Super teaching .. Great to play with family and friends ... My 7 year old nephew loved this gift.
B00APUYN0I|4.0|I didn't expect much from this movie. It was the Wife's pick and boy was I surprised at the level of entertainment given by these couple of hours. Good acting + adlibbing. Great cast for the cause, as well as some sexy scenes needed to keep my eyes on the screen and keep from dozing off.<br /><br />Mostly bold, in your face humor. 30% sex jokes. All around a good comedy.<br /><br />-K
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Awesomeness, can't wait to read the next boo. Glad I cab read then before the movie comes out. Thank you
B00ARAN9JW|3.0|The games are much better than the films. That being said, I felt that the RE series was on a downhill slope as far as entertainment and creativity. From the first of the series to Retribution, I feel the bar was raised just a little. The characters that make appearances in the movie were great and unexpected. The action was on par and the acting was still horrible. The &#34;Replacement Tyrant&#34; was very nice. :)<br /><br />-K
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Good book but is to easy to read. Overall I liked the book but just a little to short. Good book.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|This game is good,it reminds me of one of my all time favorites, 7 Wonders.  I just started to play so only time will tell.  But so far, so good. Very entertaining.
B005LAII62|1.0|This movie had so many Adult themes I am not even sure how this can be sold as a family movie.  What is the point of adding all of that to the movie?<br /><br />Language and the Lords name in vain were also throughout the movie.<br /><br />This was a great disappointment.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|Works great on my kindle fire! Easy gameplay, fun and its free! There are quite a few levels to play so it's a great game to play when you need to relax and pass the time. Enjoy!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Great read! Every chapter reveals something more and it is impossible to put down! I definitely highly recommend reading it.
000728487X|4.0|There are three issues of concern regarding science literacy.  The first is that there is, quite frankly, \\"bad science.\\"  This happens because of fraud, bias, poor experimental design, misinterpretation, and a number of other factors discussed in Ben Goldacre's excellent book, Bad Science.<br /><br />The second issue is that there are people who intentionally or unintentionally misreport or mischaracterize alleged scientific studies, or simply don\\"t get it.  These people write articles, promote blogs, or give talks or interviews that actually promote \\"bad science.\\"<br /><br />Finally, often ordinary people, Joe and Jane Public, are not well qualified to make good judgements regarding the various claims that quacks and shysters make.  And many of these claims aren't harmless issues, like which product gives you more youthful looking skin, or makes your clothes cleaner or your teeth brighter.  Many of these deal with health-related claims.  And poor decisions here have real consequences for individuals and society.<br /><br />This issue of not comprehending your own incompetence is interesting.  In one study, researchers reported that \\"... people who are incompetent suffer a dual burden: not only are they incompetent, but they may also be too incompetent to assay their own incompetence, because the skills which underlie an ability to MAKE a correct judgment are the same as the skills required to RECOGNIZE a correct judgement\\" (p. 285).<br /><br />Interesting read, with many British examples.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|Having received the book for Christmas, I found myself temporarily detached from the merry chatter of family members - \\"temporarily\\" lasted for at least a half an hour. The next day - impromptu reading session on the stairs on the way to the bathroom (just wanted to peek in for a second while heading to take a shower). In other words - the book is extremely addictive, fun and filled with great tips and information (the useful kind). Tim's playful style appeals to me very much as well. One of the goals for 2013 - meet the author and thank him in person.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|This game is fun and yet challenging. You build bridges with goo balls. Sometimes going up, down, across. Different things make it a new challenge on each level.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I'm fourteen, and I downloaded this game for my younger sister to play on. I wanted to learn how to play the game so I could teach her, and I ended up liking the game myself! Like everyone is saying, the animals are adorable, the graphics are fantastic, the sound quality is perfect, and the quests are fun to complete. My personal favourite part of the whole game is playing with the pets individually and gaining an XP of sorts to unlock new pets. The game is very addicting, and my sister and I can't get away from it! I would recommend this game to any girl!
B003ODIZL6|4.0|Made Me review even though I haven't read it so yeah it is also making me do a long review
B0052RDHTM|1.0|I bought 3 kindle edition books for a family member for Christmas. The gift email was them forwarded to the intended person and they claimed the gift. We couldn't figure out how to get the book onto the kindle so we called amazon customer service and tried to get this thing straight. It took a little over an hour and 2 customer reps ( one manager). The outcome was this. Because i bought the gift from MY amazon account and had the emails sent to me at my email address ( they were purchased a week before Christmas so i forwarded them on Christmas day, this was an option when buying) and then sent them to another email address it wouldn't work. that makes no sense! Then i also didn't know that my recipient who has an amazon account under one email address had two different passwords. One for her and one for her husband. So the gifts were accepted on the Desktop logged into HER amazon and the kindle fire is registered under the SAME email address but different password (HIS NAME). I cant believe that they cant just simply FIX IT. Just get the books i gifted onto the kindle and we can call it a day. All they could do is credit the kindle account for the same money BUT I couldn't get the credit for FALL OF GIANTS . because of some publisher nonsense..<br />People all I'm saying amazon products are inferior to Apple, spend the extra 2 bills for a better device and less headaches and better apps. Apple customer service would have never taken that long and would have fixed it not to mention probably wouldn't have happened in the first place.
B0002F6BRE|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised and elated when it arrived ahead of schedule! I will definitely be ordering from here again.

B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I would recommend this book to all who have seen the movie the differences make this book all the more wonderful to experience this is truly a classic tale.
B000OYC3J8|5.0|I love the White Stripes. Jack White can pretty much do no wrong. This cd totally rocks. Buy it, listen to it, love to it and rock to it!
B0042RJWTC|4.0|My only wish is that they had not put so much sex in this series.  I wanted to know more of the politics, people, and history of the time.  The sex ruined some of the story for me as it seemed so prevalent.  The time of the Tudors was an intense, colorful period with interesting characters and situations.  By the end of the series I was tired of looking at bouncing bare buttocks and felt they missed the mark by including nudity at the cost of what could have been a good story told well.  I felt that Jonathan Rhys Meyers did a very good job, but he was miscast.  Henry VIII was a redhead and very tall.  He filled up the room with his commanding stature.  Why they didn't have Steven Waddington, who portrayed the Duke of Buckingham, play Henry is a mystery.  I recommend Henry VIII with Ray Winstone and Helena Bonham Carter.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I was skeptical when I first picked it up, but I can honestly say that it was completely worth it.
B005LAIGLO|4.0|If you like his type of movies then you will love this film.  Lots of action but the ending was a little dissapointing but still very cool.  Defilinetly suggest this movie
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I was surprised how good the story was.  I was looking for good sci-fi and I definitely found it.  Highly recommended!!
B005Q1W10A|5.0|This is a terrific series, with well developed characters, great humor, pathos and romance.  The costumes are also gorgeous!<br /><br />Definitely worthwhile!
0740748475|4.0|The problem with this collection is that it is impossible to take the books out of the case they are in. They shouldn't have made the case so tight and added the finger indentations so we can actually grab the books. Currently I have to grab the whole thing and flip it over to get the books to come out.
B008133MDK|5.0|Excellent update of the classic detective tales.  Enjoyed learning more about the main characters as Seasons 1 and 2 have progressed.  Ready to watch Season 3.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I must say, I was not sure about the Anker High Precision Laser Gaming Mouse, because I am a female and have trouble with \\"regular\\" sized mouses. This mouse however, was not too big, and fit just right in my smallish hands, without being too large to cause discomfort. When I opened the package, I was struck with how the mouse and everything was layed out, and everything was in plain sight, so I knew I would not lose or leave anything in the box.<br /><br />I really loved the braided cord for the Anker High Precision Laser Gaming Mouse. I switched to a wireless mouse a year ago, after my cats chewed up all my other regular corded mouse. But this cord, it is very durable and thick, and I know they cannot chew it up or ruin it or fray it in any way. Of course, would rather have a wireless mouse or at least capability, because I had fiddling with cords. But the braided cord really looks like it is worth a million bucks.<br /><br />I was puzzled how I got to the software though, thinking I needed a CD-R, which I do not have with my netbook. So I finally realized you download all the software from the website, which is great for people like me without a CDR drive. But it was confusing to figure out that is what I needed to do, so a little clearer directions on that would be nice lol.<br /><br />When I first used the mouse, I noticed right away I was going to need to install some of the weights into the bottom. Without the weights, to me, the mouse felt really flimsy and like it would just fly out of my hands. So I put half the weights into the mouse, and felt like it was much sturdier.<br /><br />I did not like however, that the profile switch was on the bottom, I mean that does not make sense, and seems to be a little difficult to get to quickly. Also I had a hard time switching it because of how it was set into the bottom of the mouse, so a click option on the side or top would be better than way down on the bottom of the mouse.<br /><br />I enjoyed the mouse wheel, because it did not make noise like a lot of wheels do, and seemed very solid to the touch. Another thing that was great was the pads on the bottom, which kept it from slipping around, even if I was not using a mousepad. And that is what I need for gaming, something that will not slip or move when it is barely touched.<br /><br />Overall, the profile options and DPI settings are limitless, and this mouse would definitely be great for a gamer of many games. That way, you can set and keep profiles based on the needs of a specific game.<br /><br />For the price, this mouse really goes above and beyond what I expected, because I have tried $80 ones that were not this great. I like how the mouse just feels like it is worth a lot of money, and does not have that cheap plastic feel. Not sure about the changeable logo though, it just seems weird to change the colors on it when you never see the thing except when your not playing? I would rather have like a whole interchangeable mouse casing.<br /><br />Another thing I enjoyed was it basically was a plug in play device, I only needed to download the software to get to the profile settings and customization features. Worked with both Win 7 and XP flawlessly. I have been using this mouse mostly for SOD, and a few other fairly light games so far, and think it is the best thing ever. The side buttons are great because I can easily maneuver to each button without trouble, and don't have to look or fiddle around trying to find it, it's in a natural location. A very reliable and precise mouse for about half the cost of a \\"meh\\" mouse, so it is worth every penny. HIGHLY SATISFIED!
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Enjoyed this as the final chapter for the Christian Bale Batman movies.  As with most comic book hero movies, not all the situations are believable, but that's not the point.  Good action, cared about the main characters, and the story moved along fast enough to stay involved with this somewhat long movie.
B0091REZMW|3.0|HO too repetitive. Expensive when you run out of diamonds. Needs to offer faster ways to earn coins and diamonds.
B007EDYN36|4.0|I was somewhat hesitant to buy this (although at Kindle prices, who can resist?) due to some of the reviews accusing the author of doing very little more than pointing fingers and whining.  I did not find this to be the case at all.  I became a fan of Kiss in the 2nd grade (I'm 40 now), and I've read both Gene and Ace's books.  I enjoy biographies and autobiographies immensely, and Makeup to Breakup was no exception.  There are definitely moments where you want to grab Peter and tell him to grow up (I don't need to be reminded how big he thinks his penis is on a regular basis), but in the grand scheme of things, it was a very interesting and entertaining read.  Obviously, nobody will ever really know who is telling the truth (although I'll wager it's not Gene) about what caused the original Kiss to break up, but I appreciated what I perceived to be Criss' candor and often self-deprecating style.  Yes, he occasionally displays what one might call an inflated self-image, but this was also the drummer in arguably the biggest rock \\"brand\\" ever, so it's understandable.  What readers might find surprising is the amount of friction between Criss and Frehley, in addition to the expected friction between Simmons, Stanley, and everyone in the Kiss machine who is not Simmons or Stanley.<br /><br />Unlike some of the more recent music-related biographies, this was quite well written.  I'm quite confident that any Kiss fan or fan of hard rock biographies will find this to be a good read.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Katniss and Peeta continue to amaze us as they participate in the quarter games.  as the youngest of the tributes they have the best chance of winning however only one of them can win this time.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Many of my friends had recommended this film and they were right.  With a stellar cast of British actors I knew it had to be good.  There were poignant moments, heart-warming and life-changing stories combined with great British humour.  I will certainly watch this one more than once.
B0001I562I|5.0|This is another of those great movies you remember as a kid and then when you watch it it is just as good as an adult.  Highly recommend it!
B001FB55H6|5.0|The price, the special features and the video/audio quality of this blu-ray is excellent. I'm very pleased with this purchase.
0307944689|5.0|100% Positive, the product was in perfect condition, the features are correct, everything is perfect, it is a 100% safe and seller reliable ... I hope to do business with you again, thank you very much.
B009JBZH54|4.0|This three pack was a fantastic deal for the price. I got all three movies plus special features for less than $30.  My only complaint is that the digital copies are processed through UltraViolet rather than iTunes or Windows Media Player. This means to play them on my portable devices I have to download an extra app that only works half the time.
B0020EK4QY|2.0|The disc case was crushed during transport. The disc itself is intact but it suffers from some scratches.<br />Given the low price, I won't ask for much but one extra layer of bubble wrap would be appreciated.
B000OLGCI4|4.0|I bought this as a holiday gift for a family member who loves this movie. It comes with a DVD and packed with special features. But, I wish it wasn't so expensive or that Disney would finally release it on Blu-Ray and make it work the absorbent price I payed for the purchase.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Easy and fun to use. Really enjoy playing this game and would recommend to anyone who enjoys playing solitaire as much as I do.
B00991TCOG|5.0|My wife and I have loved listening to this album. I'm hoping that there is another album in the works.
0679809015|1.0|Not what I thought it was going to be. Too small and grandson did not like it. Needs to be bigger
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|it is so much fun to play and it keeps me young at heart which I like about the game
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|We had a great time watching this movie while waiting to eat Christmas dinner. It brought back many fond memories of past MIB movies and I was impressed with Josh Brolin. You'll like it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The second book delves deeper into the oppression from the capital.  Also we find out more about the complicated relationship between katniss, peeta and Gale.  Overall I would give the second book five stars!
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|You saw all the funny parts on the previews. I felt like this movie was a let down after hearing it was going to be so good.
B008476HBM|5.0|Beautiful story, wonderfully written. I recommend it and I believe everyone should read it st least once. I am glad I did.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|I bought this book after seeing &#34;Lincoln&#34; which I had heard was inspired by the book.  There was very little overlap as far as I could tell but the book was fascinating in its own right.
B000ZJTPLG|5.0|Excellent product!  Great sound quality and very well built.  Being able to listen along with your favourite tunes through the aux input is great!  Would recommend to anyone wanting to jam in privacy...  Your friends and family will thank you...
B009MCRHH6|2.0|I found this game confusing and frustrating.  There is little instruction in the beginning as to what you are even supposed to do.  Once I figured it out by trial and error I still had a very hard time replicating it.  After wasting about 15 minutes to complete three levels I gave up.  This game isn't worth the drain on my battery.
B00AMBH70S|3.0|The movie was okay, the action parts were great and there needed to me more of them. It was very long.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book really pulls you in. I enjoyed the movie and love  the book. I can't wait to read the last two books!
B00AHSIQWE|1.0|My review of this movie is that it was ok.  Would I watch it again? No. Once was enough. Thanks.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I like good stories and John Grisham doesn't disappoint. So gave him 4 stars. Not his best but worth the money spent.
B009NQKXYK|5.0|A lot of people did not like this movie and I have no idea why. It was a really good sci-fi movie. I am a huge sci-fi fan,that said I always go in with low expectations since so many are just awful. But this was Ridley Scott, so my expectations were higher than usual. The movie definitely exceeded my expectations. Charlize Theron is lovely and mean, as usual. The CG was amazing. There was an android, a quest to know God and why He made us and of course, Aliens. what's not to love?<br /><br />Can't wait for the sequel.
B000SZK41M|5.0|When I say its my fave Xmas movie I mean its my fave Xmas movie so don't tell me how many words I am &#34;required&#34; to use.
B00338QENI|5.0|It is an amazzing book/ that makes you stop and think about a lot of ethical issues of the past and of our time
B00005JNJV|4.0|this is a good movie of how Batman got started and in this day an age of technology and how he learned how to fight and fight an group of people that think the city needs to die.
1476719071|5.0|Wow this book was amazing! The fact that it's dark, raw, sexy & unstable made it that much more intriguing to read for me. I don't get why people are being such whiny little haters about this great book. Newsflash, stuff like this exists & is very real. You act like you've never read or seen something so scandalous before, good lord -_- it's just a book, it's fiction, fantasy, CALM DOWN. I'd like to see you right something better yourselves and have it be an all around award winning book. Then talk. For all potential future readers, don't be scared off by these idiots, get the book & enjoy something that's different, and gives insight to what these characters go through. I can't wait to read the second novel, awesome job Jaime McGuire! :)
B001GZ6QC4|4.0|this is a remake of the original with new toys and a more evil and crazy Joker that thinks every one is capable of murder
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game it is soooo sweet!! It is fun for the children too my kids love it. They are always asking to play it out of all the games I have! Its a good game so you should get it!:)) I &lt;3 it!!
B005LAIH4A|5.0|This film pretty much does stick to the original film with a little bit of change but still sticks with the original message of we need to protect our trees.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|An engaging story told in an interesting format.  An unusual consideration of nature versus nurture.<br />I was reluctant to take a break from reading it on Christmas Day and looked forward to finishing it in the peace of a quiet Boxing Day.  It did not disappoint!

B000089RVX|5.0|The dramatic yet soulful, poetic, lead vocals and all the power of ornate performances of a high energy metal band featuring solid musicians, able to mix subtle and simple passes with anthemic themes and rockin' hooks.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|A GOOD APT. EVERYONE NEEDS IT. GET THE WEATHER WHEREEVER YOU ARE. BETTER THAN THE RADIO OR TV. 4 STARS ALL THE WAY.
B001PB3RU8|5.0|Great recording (audio) quality and ethereal yet powerful and dynamic. Vocals, music, arrangements, and lyrics all above the typical pop music crowd. Flo & the Machine are seemingly being &#34;discovered&#34; by more listeners due to recent rise in exposure from TV shows and movies, as both background music and in covers by other performers.
B004TTHLBE|5.0|This is the 1st Gaiman book I have read. I am hooked. It was so well written, I was unable to put it down. American God put a hole new spin on my spiritual being. I have gone on to read Gaiman's other books including children.

B003O86FMW|5.0|4 stars.  Very good book.  Really enjoyed the reading.  Would recommend it to everyone.  Can't wait to read book 3.<br /><br />4 stars
B005HSL626|5.0|Easy and fun!  Slashing fruit with a sword is simple and addictive.  It is a good way to pass some time.
B002HFP0QU|5.0|This was a gift for my daughter who is 14 for Christmas and she Loves the Bee Gees just like her mom!
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|This is such a great game.  We love to play with our friends all over the world as well as our friends and family right in our own living room.  And, if you can't draw, it is even more hilarious!  They have added a neat button that lets you save your drawings if you want to.  Excellent!
B009VB97EY|4.0|I enjoyed this movie.  Fun and light-hearted.  I would recommend this movie to my girl friends.  The eye candy was 5 stars!!!!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|The game is awesome basically you fly around with your jet pack and collect coins.  Then you use your coins to buy new stuff in the in-game shop. I enjoyed this very much.  ~V (age 10)
B00AMBLDEE|1.0|The plot (what plot), was poorly presented. The chase scenes were chopped to impossible bits. The ending didn't ever come, it just stopped.  Teenage fare at best.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|It is angry birds with a new twist.  It is fun and added a few new birds including an ice cube bird!
B006GECE9Y|4.0|I use this browser over Chrome. The Dolphin browser allows for customization with add-ons. There are many controls on it as well to tweak it to your liking.
0307719774|5.0|First, this journal is so much smaller than I thought it would be - check the dimensions! Second, it has 365 questions and then 5 lines (one for each year) to put your answers. The idea is you answer the same 365 questions each year, for 5 years. I expected it to have 365 x 5 questions, but I can see that might have been a little bit of a high expectation! I like it either way and can't wait to use it at the start of the year - this is so much better than a blank journal :)
B004GVUPFE|4.0|This game is fun and not to challenging. It is not super easy though. I like it. It doesn't have too many permissions.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|Been having a blast with this book, very fun to finally start cooking and as a single guy the recipes are nice and minimalistic.  Highly recommend, have been purchasing the proper gear and ingredients for first time and don't have tons of left over ingredients and no use for them.
B004T2QZL8|4.0|Great time-waster. It has some creations that may not be appropriate for children. I would check it out before allowing them to play it. I beat the game in two days. It's fun. I could play again but once you do it you pretty much remember it.
B005K17RU0|4.0|This app provides me a quick glance of local weather conditions so it's easy to make wardrobe or schedule modifications.  Good layout; easy maneuverability.
B004V5A7K8|4.0|The game is pretty easy when it starts. It gets a bit harder as it goes along but it isn't so hard I would quit playing. It's great for kids and adults. Minimal permissions as well.
B002JTHFUS|5.0|U2 at the moment just before they exploded!  I loved their first three albums but I went over the moon for U2 with UF.  What a treat this package is!
B004JZBGWI|4.0|These notes are great. I like the colors and that they can be sorted by color. I like the controls and options also.
B008K3HRF0|5.0|I love Dr Seuss! I was so happy to get my kindle and be able to download this movie to take to the gym with me. :)
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|The game is  fun and easy to understand. It has great replay value as well. Might be a little challenging for younger kids.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I am so glad I downloaded this game. It was an awesome game addition to my kindle for trips. : )
B004GFN11A|5.0|I use this app for just about everything with my WordPress account. It is simple and not to messy. You can update blogs or reply right from the app.
B004UFEJXK|5.0|I like the first half, where there is no dialogue, just Wall-E and Eve.  The scenes on the ship are OK, but it's just another cliff-hanger with chase scenes at that point.  Still, it's a good movie.
B004SOR4H6|2.0|There are much better Twitter apps for Android out there. I wish Twitter would get with the program. There are pretty much no options. I like TweetCaster and Tweedle. TweetCaster is a bit busy but it has a lot of controls and the free version has ads. Tweedle is free with no ads. Not as much customization as Tweetcaster but I like it better.
B0060FXBNM|3.0|These movies are good the only i had with this box set was the special features were absent. If you dont care about having the special features buy this its very affordable for a three pack of bluray movies
B000VHMF0A|5.0|This album takes me back.  This record has some great songs in the track list and great quality audio to bring this greatness to my ears in a almost crisp sound.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|This game is really good. Been playing for a couple of days now. Another one of those &#34;physics&#34; game but this one is genuinely fun to play. Goal is to send &#34;goo balls&#34; to their destination by creating structures. The game is designed beautifully and each level is more beautiful than the earlier one (and more dangerous too ;) ). The music is fantastic as well. Overall, loved the game (lucked out and got it for free FAOD)
B00992CF6W|5.0|My 11 year old loves this crazy simple game. It's like Legos on a screen. He could spend hours building if I would let him
B00005N6KG|5.0|I can't use earbud headphones so the Sony headphones work perfectly. The sound quality is excellent!  Won't fall off when you work out!
B009ZE27US|1.0|Doesn't do anything but generate a radom number.  Deleted the same hour I downloaded after using it four or five times.
B006LS7DQE|3.0|Would be great with some tweaking.  Some of the mini-games are not very touch responsive on the Kindle Fire.  Makes what should be fun breaks kind of annoying chores.  Also, there are a lot of attributes and such that are not explained very well, if at all.  If you have never played a Puzzle Quest, like me, then this will also be an annoyance.  I really like the idea of the game, I just wish they would upgrade a few things for better game play.  I'm finding it easy to walk away from playing after a while due to the issues, but always pick it back up after some time has passed rather than just doing a complete uninstall.
B002JVWR4A|3.0|This review is more for the show itself than the DVD and its features, though I will say that it has all the standard DVD TV Show season features you expect.<br /><br />My personal least favorite season was season 4, almost to the point where I stopped watching Bones because I felt it was so bad.  However, season 5 is a marked improvement, and the show has managed to make each successive season (after 4) a bit better.  Still nowhere near the quality of Season 2, the show seems to be back on the right track starting with this season.  The mysteries are still lacking, and the main characters still have to deal with unbelievably awkward and terribly manufactured situations that are placed in most episodes solely to remind the viewer that Booth & Brennan &#34;like&#34; each other... But again, having watched seasons 6 and 7, I can honestly say that this is truly the restart of a quality series after an abysmal season 4.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Very attractive graphics display.  It handles almost every basic and advanced math you can throw at it.  I'd say to get it now... while it's still FREE... before the developer gets thoughts about charging for it.
B009VB97EY|2.0|I thought this movie would be fun. It really wasn't.  It was alright; pretty typical hollywood story and execution.  I'll start with the pros:<br />The character development of &#34;The Kid&#34; and of Matthew McConaughey's character were actually really well done.  McConaughey's character at first appears like your typical, somewhat trashy, owner of the strip club.  Throughout the movie he gradually becomes more and more skeezy and horrible, and McConaughey's performance is spot-on (even though we were all laughing at him for doing this movie throughout...).  he really puts forth a solid acting job.<br /><br />It starts out promising.<br /><br />Now onto the cons:<br />The leading lady was either HORRIBLY miscast, or is just a terrible actress.  She has one expression on her face the entire time, and her character is so one dimensional that it's like watching a cardboard cutout of a sulky 20-something.<br /><br />Channing Tatum has a great body.  This might seem like a pro, but unfortunately it is attached to someone with almost zero acting talent.  He would make a great back-up dancer, though!<br /><br />Matt Bomer, whom I generally just love, was cast in a tiny role that was either so poorly written and directed that NO ONE could have pulled it off, or he was just the wrong choice.  It happens.  I personally think he is a very good actor, but in all of his scenes in this movie he is sort of standing around like an awkward 14 year old at his first college party.  When he does speak (I think maybe once?) he comes across as someone too intelligent to be saying such stupid things.  Maybe a newbie undercover agent who should never have been sent in to infiltrate a group who's combined IQs don't quite make it into the triple digits.<br /><br />The movie has a lot of build up, and almost NO payoff.  Several things are left undone (in the case of the Kid, I actually really like how the ended it), but what about the multiple pieces of Tatum's character that we are supposed to be interested in?  We are built up on his career aspirations, his comparatively level-headedness, and potentially very interesting hints of a personality that is flawed, and is desperately trying to pretend he is not.  Instead we get no information on his background, no mention of his future career, and no indication whatsoever that maybe he is maturing past his insecurities.<br /><br />This movie could have been awesome.  I wanted it to be awesome.  It could have, at the least, been fun.  But it just was not.d to be interested in?

B0000AQS0F|5.0|The only reason I am happy this got cancelled is so Nathan Fillion could do Castle, otherwise it is a travesty of a cancellation, Firefly might just be The best Sci-fi show to have ever hit the living room.
B000AGTPUU|5.0|Great movie....Highly recommend it for everyone! It was given to greatgrandsons for Christmas and they loved it!<br />Us old folks love it too!!!
B004YM6JI2|3.0|I got this email asking if this met my expectations, the answer is no but that is not the stores fault, I think they ran out of ideas at the Supernatural writers forum, the show is just not as good as it used to be and there is an awful amount of filler episodes. Do not get me wrong it is still a good show and all, just not what it used to be.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|If you like glee you will love this.  I am considering buying it for my collection. It's fun and a must see.
B00AHSMDQY|4.0|Darker and more cerebral than any before, engrossing throughout. Would have maybe considered 5 stars but the end was &#34;borrowed&#34; from Good Will Hunting.
1594744769|3.0|I expected the story to have more intrigue and perhaps a bit of darkness. Definitely a tween book. Story a bit boring and I didn't really connect with the characters. I feel bad because I had such high hopes for the book.
B0019TSI8W|5.0|I had been looking for long time. Picture quality not that great but can still enjoy movie.  Sountracl is amazing.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Honestly, I saw the film before reading this book. I'm glad that I did because this book answered a lot of questions that I had during the movie and supplied more character information about Charlie. This book is an easy read and enjoyable. I recommend watching the film too!
0345522478|5.0|One of the best new fantasy series on the market. Fans of Harry Dresden will be especially fond of Atticus!
B008602KQI|5.0|I absolutely love this movie! It is now one of my favorites and it has a great story line. I am now going to read the books to find out what happens because I don't want to wait for another movie to come out.
B0011UBDTK|1.0|I read the reviews of numerous buyers who said these discs wouldn't play on their equipment.  I was a bit reluctant to purchase this set because of these negative reviews, but I thought maybe they were just having bad luck.  Well, I had the same experience.  I tried the first two discs and they both just pixeled out and froze.  I tried them on our DVD player as well as our computer.  I had the same results on both.  This is really too bad because the packaging looks great, and the series is definitely worth owning, but this particular product has serious problems.  The complete set on HBO.com is nearly $200, but I bet they play correctly.  This is another case of you get what you pay for.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This story was full of love sadness and hope. Unlike other love stories, this one takes the reader on unexpected turns and keeps interest throughout the novel. I recommend it.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Hopefully more to come...;) this was an outstanding series. Perhaps we might get Christian's side of the story in the next go round
B008MM9630|5.0|fairy farm is a great way to pass the time. Its fun to play and very easy to interact with. I like that it notifies you when things are ready for your return.
1856697525|5.0|I have not yet had a chance to read this book in depth, but after scanning through the pages, it is obvious that a lot of care and thought was put into it's construction.  I'd recommend this book if you are a fan or cinema, photography, or graphic design.
141970642X|5.0|My son does  NOT love to read but every time a new Diary of a Wimpy Kid books come out he cant wait to get it and he reads it non-stop till he is finished. I hope they never stop writing these books!
B008J34466|5.0|I love this CD, I only wish I would have purchased the &#34;clean&#34; version so I could crank it up and listen to it super loud.  This is great music to exercise to, love PINK's attitude.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|Just enough difficulty to keep the old brain exercised.  Beautiful graphics on my iPad 4 with easy to use screen transitions.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|Bought this CD for my daughter and she loves it.  It is nice that I don't have to be concerned about lyrics and can just let her listen on her own.  It's not necessarily my type of music, but I find myself singing along as well.
B006BGZJJ4|4.0|I purchased this as a replacement for my Kindle 2 cable which literally crumbled apart. I'm not kidding, the rubber coating on my old cable literally and completely crumbled, leaving the bare shielding exposed.<br /><br />So far the replacement cable has worked great, but I'm not giving it five stars since I'm guessing in a few years the same thing will happen with this cable as well. Only time will tell.
B008L1DNGI|5.0|I am very happy with this port. Flows smoothly and controls are certainly not an issue. I could care less for multiplayer so no points off for having none. The graphics are as they should be. Nothing substandard here. If they messed with the graphics then they would not have stayed true to this gem.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|It keeps me playing. I finished the first chapter without exiting the game. Very interesting. An advanced version of bridge builder.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|This game is very fun and calming and hard to put down.  The music is fantastic and adds to the ambient calm
B001LNOOG6|5.0|One of Archer's finest.  A compelling page turner that you can't put down.  I recommend that you have a back-up novel ready to go because you'll finish &#34;A Prisoner of Birth&#34; quickly.
B0086700CM|5.0|Downloaded the game for my 8yr old nephew. I'm now the best auntie in the whole world he loved it from the first run! It's easy to learn game.  I tried and the laughs started I'm not a gamer but this game is fun!!! U can't be mad playing this game. Great stress reliever!!!
B004DSX5B6|2.0|It's not possible to unfold knife by one hand.<br />And it's very inconvenient even to open any tool.<br />Small bag which come with this toolset is wrong as well, it contains small pocket inside, because of it when you try to put your tool in this bug it cached by this pocket.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I will have to admit I watched the movie before I read the book and I think the novel does a better job at explaining what's happening throughout the storyline. You really get into what the main character is thinking at every moment and I thought that was fascinating. It was hard to put the book down; there was always something interesting happening. I highly recommend this book. Definitely going to read her other two novels.
B000O8OTNC|3.0|this thing is cool, but when they say pocket size, they mean like for a child. I got it in with a knife I ordered and since opening the package, I can't find the dang thing
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Easy to use, can set without any difficulties.  Will be a great tool while on trips and just for getting the time at different places.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|Easy to play, to control, and very adicting world of goo is a different game that makes come back again and again
B0095GSKDE|5.0|To want something is to know it, and understand it. Outliers takes an incredible look at success by definition and practice. If you desire to be successful, this book is a must read!
B009JBZH54|5.0|First of all everything was perfect! It really got my attention in every single of these movies! The first one really narrows it down of how Bruce Wayne's life was impacted and him wanting to save the world of Gotham ! He wanted to show people that they shouldn't be afraid to feel scared at night!<br /><br />The dark knight was probably the best one. Maybe I enjoyed it a lot with the spectacular acting of Heath ledger it made the film 100 times better and this was a great film<br /><br />The dark knight rises<br />This film was maybe the best one, I don't know but dark knight and the dark knight rises were really good ! This movie got my attention with catwoman coming in the dark knight films from Christopher Nolan!! Great triology ! I really do hope christoper Nolan can maybe think again and make one more dark knight ! It's probably my favorite movies out there. Seriously<br /><br />The one thing I did not like about this was since its blu- ray I expected everything to be 1080p but since they used the IMAX format unfournately not everything was 1080p and that got me really disappointed but other than that everything was great!
0385535147|4.0|Haven't read it yet. I'll be glad to review once I read it  -- there should be a spot to just say &#34;I don't know&#34; ---
B004VSTP4Y|4.0|I didn't like how the book ended on a cliffhanger because, let's be real, in real life there is always a proper ending and all books should have them or else the story isn't complete.
0142501123|5.0|My grand daughter loved it.  She's 4.  And it's important to know that all witches aren't scary! A nice addition to her library.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|I chose this rating because his other books are better this one was ok. I sold recommend this book to a person that has read a  lot of diary books or comics
B0094BB4TW|1.0|News feed won't scroll back more than the last few entries. I would rate it much higher if they could fix the news feed.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book is a great story of a kid who needs a dance and always loses the chance, saying more would take away the fun!
B00973902K|5.0|Um...duh?  This song is great!  Received for free with CD purchase...already drove my husband crazy listening to it at the house.
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|Very funny and entering BOOK for kids under fourteen. I would definitely recommend this book to kids. I loved it
B0086700CM|4.0|Kids seem to enjoy it and has kept them busy for some time. It is easy to play and doesn't take a lot of thought
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book (story) to me was a big hit it was a great story it also gave a good message!!!!!!!!!!
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Good mind puzzle.  A little repetetive, but still a lot of fun to play.  Just tricky enough to make it a challenge.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|He did it again! Couldn't put it down :)<br />Nicholas sparks never disappoints me with his magnificent story telling! I got lost in this book and would not have it any other way!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Wow, each show just leaves you on edge wondering what happens in the next...  and Carl who we all really begin to think is nothing but trouble for the group really redeems himself with the episode where he &#34;takes care of it&#34;...oh that was heartbreaking...but made me really like him again..
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|Great book!I loved it!!! So funny l l l l l l l l l l l l l l
B0041KKYBA|5.0|I have seen this documentary twice now, and will probably go back and watch it again in the future. It is exceptionally well done, very poignant and looks at the various aspects of the Financial Crisis. I loved all the interviews, especially the ones that were done to point out the flaws and shortsightedness of the people who contributed to the crisis. The movie was entertaining as well as very educational. Charles Ferguson got access to a lot of key people to bring this documentary to fruition.<br />Absolutely mandatory watching for anyone who wants to get a better understanding of what happened in 2008 ! We will keep repeating the same mistakes and have more recessions if we do not learn from our mistakes !!
1577314808|4.0|Tolle's 'The Power of Now' is potent and inspiring, even if the course he suggests following is challenging. The topic is almost so simple you miss it, which might explain why he introduces numerous routes in to his premise. I found Anthony De Mello's 'Awareness' as engaging, if not easier to grasp and apply.
B00992CF6W|5.0|My boys love this game. They play it all the time. It has so many fun things you can do.
B00AHSIQWE|3.0|Thought the movie went overboard with the drama and tried to be something it was not. I like the realistic feel of the Christopher Nolan Batman movies, but the script could have been trimmed down a bit.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Love it because it is a wonderfully throughout the boyfriend ducking fans named back changed disks there when Greek am am eek
B00447L4JG|5.0|Tim Burton is one of only a few creative minds who's able to handle creepy, adult material in a way that's not just appropriate, but also downright appealing, to younger audiences. Beetlejuice, Pee-Wee's Big Adventure and Edward Scissorhands are all great examples of this trait at play, but of the lot I think this is his most timeless creation - which is odd, since it's the only one he didn't direct. Like the very best fairy tales, it's adventurous and unusual, taking outlandish concepts for granted as a means of sucking the audience into its own private corridor. The plot is predictable and natural, but also doesn't sacrifice its ability to throw the audience for a loop from time to time, and efficiently straddles two holidays in a manner that never feels forced or exploitative. Of course, the visuals are remarkable, bubbling with character, but the music is where it really hangs its hat. Danny Elfman has never felt more naturally at-home in the Burton universe, and considering the pair's long, storied history together, that's quite the achievement. The tunes are occasionally just a bit too catchy for their own good (I've been humming them for the better part of a day now) but that's a small price to pay for a modern fable this good.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|Its a good book but needs less meanings.<br />Its little good for me<br />I meant for my sister and me to
0316228532|4.0|I read a couple of the reviews here before I was given this book and I was curious about it. But the one thing thjt almost all those reviews said, either the ones that praised it or loathed it was that it was completely different from Harry Potter. And that was not at all what I felt reading it. I see in this book a lot of what I liked in harry Potter and also what I disliked in it.<br />First the pros: a)I felt like I was reading what the Dursleys saw as normal people. One of the things that attracted me in Harry Poter was the first chapter of the first book and what was implied about the way the Dursleys saw the world. Well, this book is a lot about people like the Dursleys and the people that are hurt by them.<br />b) The sharp humour is there, although not nearly as funny as HP, but then, being more realistic, it is also more disturbing than HP.<br />c)The love the author has for neglected children is also there, and her respect for children, as being much more capable than adults think they are.<br />Now, the cons: it drags sometimes and she really could tell the same story in much less pages. It would be more effective.<br />In spite of that, I read it eagerly and couldn't help reading it till the end and posponing everything else.
B003WUYRGI|2.0|Its a very good book<br />I like this book and I choose it because its good<br />I meant this book for me and my sister plus my mom and. Dad
B005LAIHZY|4.0|We were only able to watch this movie on Blu-ray by messing with the fast-forward, fast-reverse and play buttons. Without that fiddling it would display the scene icon continuously, run in fast-forward, or freeze, and, once, the audio was delayed by a couple of seconds after a deliberate pause.<br /><br />Buy it for the movie, which is well done, but be prepared to return it.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book is hilarious! Read this book if you get the chance. I hope you enjoy this book. I know I did!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I'm no expert but this was a story which caught my emotions. I loved it! It makes u think about what your pets are really thinking :-)
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|I rated this book 5stars because it was funny it really went inside Greg and what he wanted to accomplish during the 1semester in middle school and what he truly thinks of certain people and how he feels about them like how he doesn't really like his older brother Rodrick
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Overall, I felt the book was good and I enjoyed seeing how my favorites from the last book (Fall of Giants) interacted with their next generation.<br /><br />I had thought to see more detail on The Jewish Holocaust and the Internment of Japanese citizens into \\"concentration camps\\", but I learned more about the Nazi program euthanize the \\"useless mouths\\" of handicapped and elderly through Aktion T4 and the details of the Spanish Civil War.  It seems he covered in more detail the issues that were not as \\"main stream\\" in history.<br /><br />The main theme of the book was human relations in the face of inescapable politics; be it the Nazi regime, the overall mind set of the British Parliament or the isolationist view of the United States, so the details are in the characters and their reactions to events in history, instead of a \\"play by play\\" of events that you get with some writers.  I agree with another reviewer that I thought some of the situations just seemed a little too convenient for story telling (Woody's brother Chuck joining the Navy and being stationed at Pearl Harbor, etc..).  But it is line with his other books.  Stranger things have happened in history.<br /><br />Overall it was entertaining and educational.<br /><br />I am looking forward to book III.  I read this one in about 10 days.  A real page turner!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Love this book. Can't wait to read the second book and the third. The hunger games is now one of my favorite books.
B007MDB548|5.0|This movie makes me happy! I bought this for my 3 yr old niece for Christmas, but I secretely watched the 3D movie with my BF on his 3D TV prior to giving her the original version for XMAS. She doesn't have a 3D TV, nor understand the concept of 3D since she is only 3 years old anyways. It came with 4 discs, so I figured why not :) My BF and I have started up quite a collection of 3D digital cartoons ever since he purchased his TV, and this one by far has had the best 3D effects. With Tinkerbell's sparkling wings, and the shimmering of the fairy's outfits, and the cute little forest creatures, it was all that a girl (at any age) would love! My boyfriend loved the 3D effects, and I think he truly enjoyed the actual movie and storyline as well. (Although he would never rave to his buddies about the Tinkerbell movie that he recentely watched! ;) I know this, because after the movie he made a comment about he appreciated the fact this was the first Disney movie he watched that did not possess one &#34;bad&#34; character, and he was absolutely right! With all Disney movies there is always good guy vs bad guy, but this one didn't have that kind of storyline and it was very refreshing to see. I recommend this movie to any person at any age regardless of 3D or not! The 3D version is a BONUS, but either way it's great!!
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|i do not like putting my information computers and u can not get free games with out a card number. if its free let it be free. there always a catch to the word free.
B000JMKQX0|3.0|It's okay. I'm interested how the movie treatment will turn out. It's hard to go back and forth to the glossary on my kindle. Footnotes would have been better.
B003WQT2YY|2.0|This is much longer than what you saw in the theater and what's added is not very good. Also, I was &#34;streaming&#34; (I guess that's the word, I don't know) it - my computer was connected to the internet and also to an external monitor which has pretty good quality usually and the sharpness really sucked. It was quite disappointing and not at all what i remember from seeing it on the big screen. There is still a lot of good material - well, great material - but the overall package detracts majorly.
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|Awful movie. Beyond ignorant. Just vulgar. Couldn't take anymore than 20 mins and that was pushing it. Adult humor is nice, ignorance is another. Only a immature juvenile would find it amusing.
B002SAS26E|5.0|One of the best two player card games around. What makes it so attractive is that it it easy to learn but it's not a simple children's game. There is an element of luck but you also need to strategize your use of camels, what to collect and for how long, etc. A great addition to any game collection.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I can read books from my fire on anything that supports this app. I can download them from my cloud and read them on my phone or another tablet!!! If you own a kindle, this app is a \\"must-have\\"!!!!
B005GFPZYK|2.0|This book created more frustrations that enlightenment, and it was a relieve getting it done!<br />Do understand that being a SEAL is being a part of an exclusive club, but at the same time those selected few should be better and beyond ordinary people.<br />If this is the case here, I'm not sure.<br />People from all around the world will read this book, and for US patriots it might be an amazing book, but I'm sure a lot of people around the word will see a typical stereo type american man, one of those easier to hate than understand, and as such it might have been a better idea that this book was never written.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|the book was amazing and i love it so much now i can read the next books of the hunger games
B0047Y0FGY|2.0|I held onto this to read over the Christmas holiday, so I'd be sure to have a solid, funny read on long afternoons.  What a disappointment!  While there were many funny bits, I did not really learn anything about Tina Fey or how she broke into and got to the top of the SNL boys' club, or what it was really like getting a hit show off the ground.  Nor did I find anything about revelatory about her family.  I did appreciate her tiny takes on female power, and I enjoyed the snippets about Palin, but overall, it did seemed to avoid everything that is fascinating about Tina Fey.  Every time I thought she was about to share an insight or a genuine feeling, she shifted t something else.  Maybe that is the real story?  Or maybe there will be a later volume with the REAL story....? In any event, unless you are looking for light comic bits with no substance, you can skip this one.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|A really good my little pony game! Good music and the games are challenging! Love love love it! Thank you s o much for making this game.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|and this soundtrack just reminds you of the scenes in the movie.  Amazing! All of the actors do their own singing.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Well written, and the character development was interesting but not my style. Character thoughts and actual words kept running together.
B007N5YIUS|2.0|Every 2-4 tries there's a commercial, often times it just a black screen and a messege, &quot;resume in 15/30 seconds &quot;.  The game itself is fun, but total bombardment of commercials is a real turnoff.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|It costs to do anything in this game.  We have played for several day but only earn enough coins to buy a very few amount of things.<br />a
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|This show is a lot of fun with its spin on a modern-day Sherlock and Watson. Lucy Liu and Jonny Lee Miller have great chemistry together.
B003YUC9JI|5.0|All I needed ... good price what more could i ask ? 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8
B00933JF74|4.0|This game is horribly addicting! Its so much fun, and a very good balance of fun and challenging. I love these kinds of games, and this is definitely one of my favorites!<br /><br />My only complaints are that I can't figure out how to manage my warehouses in larger cities (it constantly tells me I need more warehouses, even when my city is full of them) and I cannot get my &#34;Juice Producers&#34; to make more juice than my townies consume.
B00ADIT8U2|4.0|I really enjoyed this game. It's not hard enough to require a walkthrough to complete the game, but is challenging enough to keep your interest.
B00571F26Y|4.0|Very informative.  Will be seriously considering giving this a try.  A great time to get started since the new year is coming very soon.
B000FC10WU|5.0|A wonderful mystery that keeps you guessing until the end.  The description of each character was so well done that you feel like you know them. Truly an intriguing book.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Beautifully written. Exciting story line that keeps you engaged and wanting more. The characters are lifelike and unforgettable. Can't wait to read the next book in the trilogy.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|this isn a great searies for the things that happen to the rich and super rich of the world and the end result.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Reflected in You will keep you on your toes. I cannot get enough of Gideon and Eva's relationship. Don't even think twice about buying this book or not. JUST DO IT!!! Read this whole novel in one sitting, it's that addicting. Can't wait for the 3rd book!!!!!!!
B0053O89JM|5.0|thanks for the time that my family laugh and have a good time watching the things that go on. thanks
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I thought it was a awesome book because it could happen to anyone.<br />Jeff Kinney has outdone himself again.<br />I hope he makes a book eight.
1593272782|5.0|this gave a large amount for us to see how much the kids would do for thir imagination and creativity.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Another quick read by Grisham that is hard to put down. Keeps you wondering until the very end and is much different than things he's written before.
1593272790|5.0|this is a fun way to be able to get the v=creative force for more life and the times to be more capable
0316098329|5.0|I started the book early one morning, and by the evening i had completed it. Best book I've read in some time. Was a bit throw back by the breastfeeding. But as I read on I understood, breast milk is full of vitamins, and nutrients to keep her child safe even if the worst happens and food is scarce. The story being written from the 5 year olds point of view is perfect for this story. It is well worth the read, id love to read the same story from the mothers point of view as well.. Great story..
1593272774|5.0|The play out is hard without better instructions but is a better game for all the older kids and what they want to do.
1452101248|5.0|This is a beautiful book that will offer you many happy hours of cooking and also makes a fabulous gift for a cook.
0060853972|5.0|It is weird looking back like this. After more than a decade of devout reading of every single bit of information about \\"Discworld\\" and his creator, I finally picked up \\"Good Omens\\". What? I took my time. There always seemed to be something else to read, and world of \\"Good Omens\\" wasn't travelling on the back of space-floating elephants, and I never really liked Gaiman's writing and so on. I could go for a long time like this. I won't though. Better late than never the saying goes so I guess I'll - late as I am - be alright. Anyhow, gonna stop rambling in a moment. Thing is, looking back like this, I see a different book than the one I could have seen 20 years ago. Oh, well - let's face it - twenty years ago I was a sniveling kid of 9 but it won't be long before the first \\"Discworld\\" book arrives in my hands. Aforementioned sentence is true though (the one saying something about some difference). If first contact happened 15-ish years ago, it isn't just that I would have been much younger, or less \\"wise\\", or inclined to favor certain things over the others. It wouldn't have been just that. Trouble is much more technical in nature, but let me try to explain.<br /><br /> Every writer has his tricks of the trade. This is especially true for bestselling authors. If you're successful enough to make a living with writing, you'll be less inclined to experiment with form. Sometimes, your name alone will sell whatever you do. But, before one reaches that point, one treads a dangerous road. Pratchett's early years of Discworld were like that. He was, and still is, one of the best authors of fiction and a master of English language. Still, if you look carefully upon his early books, you'll start noticing his little tricks. How he does this or that, how he resolves a conflict and how will certain character type react in a certain situation. Pratchett will fill every book with little details and much wittiness so that they never appear quite the same, but underlying structure - themes, topics, tropes, idioms etc. - will, basically, remain the same. Gaiman is doing the same thing. Of course, this isn't bad in itself. You just notice it when you go along, especially if you spend some time with their writing.<br /><br /> For me, reading \\"Good Omens\\" was like reading the history of the trade. Trade being this particular kind of writing these two guys do. There's a familiar feeling in the air, you see the characters moving on a stage which you don't know much about but you know you've seen traces of it somewhere else. There are four riders of Apocalypse (and this time, their horses aren't stolen), there are witches (or intelligent women), there are Demons and Angels which are neither that Bad or that Good, there are Big Bosses up in the sky (or down under, which is not to say that they are in Australia), there's a bit of Enid Blyton with a sprinkle of good ol' pastoral scenery of ye olde Ynglande, there are endless summers with roaming gangs of children upsetting proper letter-writing gentlemen, there is occult and The Occult - first one a domain of an elderly lady which you've probably seen peeking from the upper window of a big building, picking up information far better than any NASA satellite could; the other a domain of that certain type of lady-like individual who reads occasional Judith Butler and tops it with secret diaries of Alistair Crowley, combining it both with older-than-print recipe-book - former property of a forgotten Elder who used to make wicked herbal medicine and type of cheese which sole stench could kill you two counties away - there are footnotes (there always are), and there are thousand little details like that, all of them contributing to this marvelous world rather like ours or same as ours (provided you can find a flaming sword lying around somewhere).<br /><br /> Both Gaiman and Pratchett are wonderful world-builders. This became more than obvious in their later work. In \\"Good Omens\\" you still can see few stitcheslying around. You know - parts of text that play out like a joke rather than a part of a whole, weird plot meanderings and stuff like that. You can see characters that will be used again (in a slightly different manner) in later books, you can see joke variations (every good comedian have these), you can see familiar Topics like destiny, free will, bureaucracy, deities and such finding their way in - these topics will be re-visited yet again and again - you can see building bricks of wondrous worlds that will happen in subsequent years etc.<br /><br /> Seeing all of this can spoil this kind of magic a bit. If you let it. In a moment of nostalgic remembrance (commonly known as wishful thinking) I imagine myself reading this back then, when I was unspoiled by all this noticing. Unfortunately, that cannot happen. Still, spoiled as I am, I still can spot a good book when I see one, even if I don't enjoy it as much as I might have. And \\"Good Omens\\" is a good book - never you doubt this for an instant. If you time you reading just right, it may even become your favorite book, like, ever.lying around.

B005LAIHGI|5.0|Well as a poignant political satire their is really nothing more you could ask from this movie. It highlights all of the shortcoming of Middle Eastern culture with harmful stereotypes included. Middle Eastern and Western attitudes and stereotypes are both illuminated for examination.
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|This game puts a nice spin on it from the original......love that its just a bit different but still fun.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Coin Dozed is a great game, but I hate how I have a limit for my coins while I'm off line. To make this game better, DON'T HAVE A LIMIT. Please?
B001FB4VXU|5.0|Big Bang turned out to be a Big gift choice.  Wife big fan of the show not wants the next season.  Enjoy very much and good quality.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|I was looking for a something creepy and thrilling and I found it. The story took me back to my youth with the thrill like Stephen King on a dark rainy night when your 15. I hope you enjoy it as well!<br />Many thanks to Blake Crouch: I am going to find another of your novels right now...
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|hay creater of the game ween you make in update  please take the adds out of it please pretty please!!! (do you here me)
B0067R0APK|3.0|hate the &#34;sale&#34; icon on my kindle.  took it off my device but left it on the cloud for now.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Most books are predictable to me. I still love those books but I know what's going to happen. This book had many turns so many you never see coming. Colleen Hoover definitely outdid her self.
B0053O89Z6|5.0|I love How I Met Your Mother, and this season is no exception! It will keep you laughing! A must have for anyone with the set in progress!
030758836X|1.0|I AM OLDER SO PROBABLY THIS BOOK  JUST WASN'T MADE FOR MY GENERATION BUT WHAT A TERRIBLE BOOK IN MY OPINION.  ANY PLOTTED HER DISAPPEARANCE LIKE A PRO BUT WHATEVER FOR..JUST GET A DIVORCE!!
0316056863|4.0|Good for a laugh. I love Tina Fey, and her sense of humor definitely shines through in this book. I was laughing out for sure in the beginning. The later chapters aren't quite as amusing, but I would still recommend this book.
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|This is a great culmination to the Dark Knight series. I was surprised at the storyline and even more surprised at the ending.
0307888681|5.0|My high school students really enjoy this book. Since I bought it for my classroom library, it is almost always checked out. It has been a hit especially with the boys!
B000OVLBGC|5.0|Saw this film in an international film class. I thought the subtitles might bother me, but actually, after a while they are not noticeable. This is a great film about the cold war and the lives of those deeply affected by it. Had to own it.
B000Q7ZO8U|5.0|This is an excellent Christmas movie for the whole family.  My nearly 3 year old loves it, and my husband and I enjoy watching it with him. Great for train loves especially!
B009MCRHH6|5.0|This is one of the very best games you can get for you kindle fire, can go wrong with with it.

B001IYCMNA|5.0|Got my Cisco 4410 WAP today and it’s all hooked up.  Good stuff.<br />Here was my situation:  I have a router from the SP on one side of my house.  My office is on the other.  By the time I close the door to my office, my devices can’t even see my wireless router on the other side of the house.<br />The Cisco 4410 WAP fixed all that.  Works beautifully but only after you understand some things.<br />First, hardwire it into your SP router on one of the cat 5 ports.  Within a minute, you’ll see the new wireless network from a device. I think the default name was ciscosp, or something like that.<br />That’s great – you can cruise around on the internet and it’s wonderful.<br />But you want to be able to configure the darn thing, of course.  Here’s how:<br />The default IP address for the WAP is 192.168.1.245.  But it will go with DHCP (ie dynamic IP address) and if that happens then you won’t be able to find it.<br />Here’s what I had to do:  hardwire my MBP to the WAP with an ethernet cable.  Now I had it’s attention.  I went to 192.168.1.245 and could configure.<br />UN/PW is admin/admin.<br />1)  First move:  On the Setup/Basic Setup screen:  change the Network Setup from DHCP to Static IP Address.  And now you change the Local IP Address to 192.168.1.245.  Now you know how to find it and it won’t jump around due to DHCP.<br />Set the subnet mast to 255.255.255.0 and “point it at” your SP router.  Ie, set the default gateway to 192.168.1.1 (that’s usually the address of your SP router).<br />HIT SAVE<br />Change to the right time zone while you’re in the Setup Section.<br />2)  Go to the wireless section.<br />Wireless/Basic Settings: IMPORTANT:<br />In the wireless section, it’s important to do 2 things.<br />First, change the Wireless Channel from the default to option 11 – 2.462GHz.  This will reduce interference.<br />Next, Enter the SSID.  USE THE SAME NAME AS YOUR SP ROUTER.<br />So if your WAN comes up on your devices as JonesHouse, then use JonesHouse as your SSID here.  You may be tempted to use JonesHouse2.  But don’t.  Use JonesHouse – the idea is you want your devices to roam from the WAP to your SP Router seamlessly as you walk around the house.  So use the same SSID.  That's the whole point.<br />HIT SAVE<br />Wireless/Security:<br />Make sure you have  your new SSID at the top, which will only happen if you saved it in the prior step.<br />Now you probably want SPA-Personal here for the security mode.<br />Enter TKIP as the WPA Algorithm<br />Enter your pre-shared Key – use the same one you use on your SP router!<br />3) Administration<br />Administration/Management – here’s where you change your UN and PW from admin/admin to something else.<br />Next:  under Web Access, you want to ‘Enable’ Wireless Web Access so that you can hit this puppy from your wireless devices as opposed to always having to hardwire into your SP modem.<br />REPEAT – this is why it’s important to get off the admin/admin UN/PW.<br />SAVE<br />You should be good to go.<br />NOTE:  I actually have a specialized VPN router from work in my office that’s tied to my cat 5 cable drop in my office.  So I hook up to that VPN router and it takes me back to a VPN server in RTP from TPA.<br />So – I bought a $12 ethernet switch from the local staples (D-Link something or other).  Hooked the ethernet switch to my cat 5 drop.  Then hooked the 4410 WAP to one port and the VPN router to the other.<br />It all works beautifully!  I can now hit my SP Router network in full strength from my office!<br />And I can use my vpn router.<br />Hope you find this helpful.
141694737X|5.0|This is a favorite book to be read at bedtime. The flaps are fun, and my son enjoyed making animal noises for the animals, too, or being the one to identify what animal was under the flap. When he was 1.5-2, he could not get enough of this book and we read it time after time. He still likes it now at three, but reading it once or twice a week is enough now. :)
B003F3FJQO|3.0|first book was good and from there it begins to fizzle a bit with each book. However, it was a good way to pass the time.
B00A6PD8RQ|3.0|Ok..but the story drags in the middle. Not one of Pixar's best movies.  The storyline regarding the bear transformation was hokey.
0062127241|4.0|Bought the kindle version on accident and since Im a semi fan of the Who figured Id roll with it and read. Pete is a talented, talented man who warts and all was able to write his memoirs in a self effacing style chock full of self doubt and graphic details of his highs and lows. This is not some puff piece of ghostwritten ego massage...you can tell he put a lot of thought into the project and really went 110% to put out a good product. After reading I felt I knew his personally, which is about all you can ask for an autobiography. If you are a fan of the Who, Townshend, or simply love Biography this is certainly a worthy read. Not sure why I didn't give it 5 stars...
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I agree with most reviewers. This is top notch sci-fi and just plain damn excellent entertainment. Why dose fox alway cancle the good stuff and keep the s***. Remember Futurama. They brought that back. Too bad another network did not pick it up. There is so much crap TV out there and they drop this show...just makes no sense. The movie was also great work...these actors worked very well together. Sigh.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|fits the kindle perfectly, cute color and it appears to be well made.  Would def. purchase one again in the future.
B000YHG72E|5.0|My girls and I love watching this as Christmas draws near or even on Christmas Day.  It is appropriate and engaging for all ages.
B009KHDT0C|1.0|Did not download when I ordered it, showed it had successfully downloaded, but it didnt and also had to pay for this one!!
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|Great music! This was a Christmas gift and I've already sent it to three other people. I hope they put out another CD at the end of the season.
B009NPKTN6|1.0|Did not download and nobody got back to me and I will not pay for it again, will go without, also lost magic mike at the same time, that also didnt download and I also got charged for it!!!!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|We got this game for my daughter's kindle but I embarrassingly had so much fun playing it that I downloaded it on my kindle as well!!!!
B007N5YIUS|5.0|we alll love angry birds it is one of the best games just wish it was free but i guess we cant have everything free lol
1451695195|5.0|What could be more compelling than a neurosurgeon's telling of his experience in the world after this?  A neurosurgeon, a scientist, a skeptic before his NDE (near death experience)...who better to bring the news?
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|Some will say that LM Alcott is too openly preachy, but her unabashed devotion to all the tried and true virtues is refreshing.  The story, which I have read many times, is sweet and sentimental.  I last read \\"Little Women \\" as a teenager, and now that I am a 40-something year-old mother and wife myself, I am frankly shocked by how touched I was by the effect that re-reading it had on me.  The little words of guidance, maternal advice, and quiet examples of virtue and self-sacrifice take on new meaning and seem to reflect even more timeless wisdom now that I have some years of life experience myself.  I believe stories such as this are exactly what is needed to help guide a new generation of girls toward a happier and more peaceful adulthood.
B00A0SKFLG|1.0|First off let me start by saying that I went into this thinking it was actually a remake of the first movie &#34;Total Recall&#34; that came out with Arnold swarzenegger. I couldn't have been more disappointed as the entire plot of the movie was changed. That being said... Even if this movie carried a completely different title the plot was so weak that it seemed like a bunch of pointless action tied together with bad dialogue. There was some creative ideas with regards to technology but it seemed just thrown in to make up for the lack of story. The acting was ok... Bryan Cranston played his char well but the rest of the actors didn't seem to have very good direction.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|It has all the versions I think I will ever need, it searches well, it is very useful and great on my kindle fire.
B0049J0CTM|2.0|I ordered this film to show in my class.  It was disappointing.  The sound was so low we couldn't hear the dialogue.  At first, I thought it was my equipment.  I then tried another film on DVD, and the sound was fine with that.  I don't know if something went wrong with the streaming, but it was quite a let down.
B008TRUDAS|4.0|This book was filled with heartbreak and happiness. It really makes you put your own life in perspective. There is always someone out there that has it worse, just be happy you are alive.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|This game is very addicting and I enjoy playing it on my kindle fire. It reminds me of the Oregon trail I played in school as a kid.
B006O6F932|4.0|I would give it a 4.5--neat toy that has so many awesome details.  Only issue is getting part of it to fasten correctly--the ladder doesn't snap into place.  Have fixed them by leaning it against a wall--other than that, neat toy!
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|There is not much to say other than well done.  This story was one that made me laugh, cry, feel emotions I didn't know I could from a book. Bravo!
B006XBSAP2|5.0|Katy Perry struck gold with this collection. Almost every song is excellent the whole way through. She successfully makes several small 'statements' here and there.. but mostly it's just a slam dunk good time... and what the heck.. that's what  this party is all about right?<br /><br />Absolute standouts among the 13 very good songs (out of 19 on the deluxe edition) are: &#34;Wide Awake&#34; and &#34;Not Like the Movies&#34;<br /><br />Solid &#34;A&#34; effort is Highly recommended.
0307454568|5.0|Just so hard to put down.  It is very sad that this author has left us because I would have read every one of his books.
B0034G4P9E|5.0|This was a great sales experience! Everything was as advertised and came on time.  The product was new and in original packaging and it shipped same day!;
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|We found ourselves in a place without an alarm clock.  The cell phone alarm wasn't loud enough and we were afraid of oversleeping.  The old-fashioned alarm clock alarm did the trick!  It was easy to set up and use, but I couldn't get it to use the local time zone instead of our home time zone, so had to set the clock as if we were home.  It could have been my problem.
0385535147|5.0|He doesn't write bad novels.  He just keeps cranking out his best.  I know, I have read them<br />all and even have gone back and reread a few of my favorites.  I am always waiting impatiently<br />for his next one.  You will be too!
B0081SPK0I|5.0|Best FAOTD in a long time.  Excellent controls and graphics.  Get it; you won't be disappointed.  Kudos to the developers - great job!
B003R4ZMNQ|3.0|I love this show. Best new show on tv. But when I this collection the case busted. I have to get another case for it. I was not happy.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|This is one of his best novels yet.<br />I loved the way the author gave you a unique insight into an abuser. I thought katie was a believable character but Alex was a bit one sided, almost to perfect. But Kevin was evil and scary.<br />I can't wait for the movie.<br />I loved the ending...perfect..i don't surprise easily but this ending was a surprise
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This was a very good show. Very different future show. Really good take on show. Nathan Fillion does an awesome job in this show.
1451620829|5.0|The Catman tells an amazing life story, It will blow your mind, best book from a Kiss member so far.
0061684384|5.0|Christmas gift for my Kat Von D. fan. She hasn't put it down since she got it, and let me take a quick peek. Nice photos and interesting commentary.
B0081SPK0I|3.0|This game seems pretty cool. It just looks pretty terrible on my Nexus 7 tablet because of the archaic graphics but the gameplay is very fun.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|As usuel the BBC films are excellent but what I think that lacks is the French and Spanish subtitles and subtitles in other languages as well (a good way to learn foreign languages).<br />There could also have been a French and a Spanish audio version but with the subtitles I would have been satisfied.<br />Here I am still quite wanting more.<br />The actors are good, the scenery is good and for me it is my favorite version of Persuasion even if it is the oldest and has a circus ending (I don't like circuses).<br />I really like Frederik's imposing bearing, his physique is very handsome.
B009MCRHH6|4.0|This game is simply awesome. A great puzzle game that can easily be perceived as a kids game, but looks can be deceiving. This is a must buy for any mobile/tablet gamer.
B0010YPTGU|5.0|I have been watching this concert DVD more than 20 times .  So I decided to purchase more to friends for Christmas gift . You share beautiful things with friends.
B00913P6G0|5.0|I have been a Kendrick Lamar fan since 2010. This album was pre-ordered as soon as it was made available on Amazon and I had high expectations (and anxiety) for Good Kid: M.A.A.D City. I must say, Kendrick definitely delivered. In terms of his story-telling, production, lyricism, and flow he has made progression as an artist who started out rapping like Lil' Wayne. THIS IS A MUST BUY. Going gold in a month should attest to that, if the numerous album of the year awards and other critical acclaim has not. I wish the other bonus tracks were on the Amazon release rather than Itunes (I like to have physical possession of great albums)<br /><br />Favorite Songs:<br />B-tch Don't Kill My Vibe<br />Money Trees<br />Sherane a.k.a Master Splinter's Daughter
0545265355|5.0|It was very good and fast service and just in time for Christmas.  My granddaughter love them.  Item was as stated.
B008BGNMZU|5.0|Typical genius from the Fantastic Fourplay. With these guys all you have to say to me is Fourplay has a new CD out and I'll buy it. Name recognition is all it takes.You're always going to be satisfied w/these guys. Bravo Fourplay Bravo!
B009X00E18|4.0|I LIKE IT VERY MUCH, IT IS MADE FOR THE READERS CONVENICE,IT WILL PRACTICALLY SIT ANYWHERE OR ON ANYTHINGAND PROTECTS THE SCREEN WHEN NOT IN USE
B0091LS07E|2.0|I really like one song. The duet w/Maxwell The rest of the CD I don't really like at all.Girl On Fire No! Not Really
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|I wanted to hate it, what a silly idea having a talking bear but everything else in the story is &#34;real&#34;, but I couldn't!  I think I laughed the entire way through the movie.  It was hilarious!
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|Another great addition to the angry birds franchise.  The Star Wars version includes additional bad guys and weapons straight out of the Star Wars universe, like Lightsabers, lasers, Storm Troopers and, of course, Darth Vader.  I loved it so much I plan on getting the full version!
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I spent so much time my kindle died and I wanted to play it more so I ran to get my charger. It's that fun. Get it it's free!! When you download it the awesomeness starts!!! I say get it get it get it!!!!
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Easy to play. Nice graphics. The story line was an easy read and kept the game play interesting. The best part was the shuffle feature that allowed for more play.
B007SGM084|1.0|a few of my friends read the books and kept telling me to read them so I finally got around to reading all four back to back...sorry to say but it wasn't as tantalizing as people were making it out to be...i fully expected more.  rent 9 1/2 Weeks--that was more interesting...it's obvious that this was written for bored longtime married women who are bored with their spouses.  one of my male friends even said he expected more based on the hype it got!!
B008IGP8QE|5.0|Met all requirement and arrived before holiday, bid with confidence.Thanks and look forward to doing business again with these sellers.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Very easy to use and not annoying at all. Very glad I downloaded this app.keep up the good work guys!
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|The authors of Two Graves have woven threads from several previous stories into a pleasing fabric. They answer questions that I had forgotten remained open from their previous books while also giving us a satisfying villain for Pendergrast to pursue in future adventures.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|The title says it all. Fun, addicting, and quite challenging. If you enjoy the match 3 games, this is a must have.
1402528140|4.0|Umberto Eco is a brilliant individual, an outstanding author, and he possesses a bounty of knowledge related to the the field of semiotics. That said, if The Name of the Rose is a 10/10, and the Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana is an 8.5/10, Baudolino is *only* a 7/10.<br /><br />The book is several parts Eco weaving history and fiction together (and well, I might add), mixed with one part of utter and complete weirdness. If this was the peak of Eco's weirdness, I'd be fine with it, but evaluating it in retrospect (having recently read The Prague Cemetery), I can see that this book represents the point at which Eco started his slide into the deep end of the crazy pool.<br /><br />Read Baudolino. Enjoy it. But if you do, remember what I said when you progress onto Eco's most recent work (The Prague Cemetery).
B005XI9456|5.0|I love this CD, its great because it also includes other top artists. Its a nice modern Christmas album with some of the classics on it.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Wow, I'm impressed! I don't like to game much so I was expecting to get bored easily. What a great and fun way to kill some time!
B005ZOBNOI|3.0|Well written story.  I should think teens would love it.  I read it in a few hours.  All in all, I enjoyed the book.
0307596885|5.0|Poignant stories by Alice Munro. Every word counts; she imparts so much meaning in every phrase. The final stories offer interesting insights into Munro's own life.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I enjoy having this on my kindle so i have my bible with me all the time.  It is very useful
B009VLX8FS|5.0|Awesome mp3 for the price easy to download on my phone and computer. Now to figure out how to transfer to iTunes without computer
B00AMBH70S|3.0|Not as much kicking butt as the previous, slow starting. I feel asleep twice about 2/3rds in. Pretty violent in the beginning.
1469984202|5.0|I have been struggling for years to be able to concentrate long enough to finish a book. It's been 7 years since and it has been extremely frustrating. Then I stumbled upon Wool. Wool broke my dry spell. I couldn't put it down. I couldn't not finish it. It was amazing. I liked this book so much I bought the hardcover version so I can have it on a shelf and be reminded of how much I enjoyed this book.
B005K17RU0|5.0|keeps me informed about what is going on with the weather, has been pretty accurate. nice to be able to see what the weather is in different areas where far away loved ones are!
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Highly recommended. Picked up this game as a free app of the day, yet I would have paid if I knew it was this fun. Very addicting.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|An interest filled review of the mid century. Well paced and adventurous such as to keep the reader turning pages. I am looking forward to the next book in this trilogy.
B005NFJAZS|5.0|My 13 year old son and I enjoy watching this musical. We watched it when he was eight and often times reference parts of it.  I bought it for him as a gift.
B0019LY5IM|5.0|anyone who has watched lost or if you have herd of lost and wanted to watch lost this is season 5 of the 6 season set
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is awesome. A lot of my friends have read it and told me I should read it so I read the preview and decided to buy it. I loved it. Couldn't stop reading even though I hate reading. I gave it four stars because I had to constantly look up the words and the end wasn't that great. I'd recommend it to all my friends.
B005LAIHQS|5.0|well mib 3 was and is a hit tommy lee ,will smith and crew did a great job on mib3 ive watch all 3 3 times now :)
B0012SCHZK|4.0|However my students loved it.  I had to send home permission slips for them to see it since it is rated R but it was phenomenally helpful in making the tale memorable.  I used it after they had taken the test and three months later they had much better recall when we began to review for their final exam.
B005LAIGRS|5.0|denzel washington as usual did another great job in this movie they put a great story together in this movie
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Didn't realize it until after the second viewing, but I love this movie. Bane is freakishly awesome.  Too bad it's nolans last.

B004O3YGMC|5.0|works just like it is supposed to. love the mouse buttons at the bottom of the screen. glad it gives option to bring sound from computer to kindle or to leave it at the pc. really fun to play with at parties!
B008UUPOVM|5.0|Very easy and enjoyable to listen to. I felt that it retained the 'Owl City' sound while being different. This is a good album just to turn on and listen to.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|As a free gifts. I like it.<br /><br />it's size it big than my imagination. It's very useful for  me .
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|Life's too short to spend it playing video games!  Get outside and enjoy the world and the real people around you!
076115728X|5.0|so creative - the 1st time I saw this and read it to my daughter at the library I fell in love with it.  I buy it for every kids birthday party now!
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|This was a great read about someone who had ruined his life but was able overcome his drug problem.  I think this is a rare situation, but nice to see it is possible.
B0053VKP8S|1.0|I got this for a soundbar for my tv im pretty good with wirind so one two three done i tryed a thousand different different ways still nothing i called the seller gave me a different way to try it still nothing sent it back it must work for something just not a soundbar
B00AFWEPVI|1.0|It's alright. The picture quality isn't great but that doesn't have anything to do with the app!! It's the camera quality if the camera on the Kindle that sux....
B004HEXSLI|5.0|The author takes you into her world as she suffers a severe stroke, the recovery and rehabilitation, and then the amazing account of this patient, a research Neuroscientist by profession, as she describes what happened.  What she felt and saw thru her eyes is remarkable, insightful, astounding and inspiring.  She recovered and returned to lecture and write, you can see her on YouTube, Jill Bolte Tayor.
B008V4H6N6|4.0|This album by flying lotus is a great listen. Maybe for those into electronica or some hiphop instrumentals but i am enjoying it
B007704HO6|5.0|I came across this author and book through Facebook by a friend who had liked the page. I got curious and liked the page as well.I bought this book yesterday and could not put it down. It is simple, sweet, honest about the fragility of life,heart warming and so inspiring. Anyone who is an animal lover and understands our pets true purpose in our lives will fall head over heels for Bob and his human, James.It will make you cheer them on! Well done and I highly recommend reading this wonderful story.
B005I64U5C|5.0|The whole movie is 3d, not just a random scene here and there.  Only saw the 2D in the theatre, 3D is MUCH better!!!!  The price is terrific, too!
B009E3EWPI|5.0|LZ is always great. I have to type more words to review this.  This is now wasting my time. BAH HUMBUG!
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|Coolest little game ever...have fun playing with my kids and friends and guessing what they have drawn can be quite entertaining.
B005CRQ4GU|1.0|I love this book it is really funny. It is the best-selling book. I love it so much I will read it again. Yea it rules
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Check it often for updates and got home before the blizzard hit OH.  Wouldn't be without it on my Kindle.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|I love the show, so I decided to start reading the comics. Keeping each desperate I love both. Its fun to compare each one also.<br /><br />The comic does a good job of explaining the characters emotions, but often times tends to skip through a bit, leaving some scenes up to your imagination. No traditional comic scene descriptions, so reads are quick and often leave something to be desired. Overall still like the comic, love the television series.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|Its nice to take a trip back to an easier time when nothing was wired into a social network and to make friends and have adventures kids needed to leave their house and DO something.  Twain is the best storyteller.
B007C7UZIG|5.0|(Minus the Library) Everything is there. I can buy games then later download them when I get to my computer. Sales show up via push notification, I can chat with my friends, I can hit up the community, check news, etc. This is a great app for Steam users!
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Thought this was the stupidest thing I'd ever seen until I started playing it.  Now I find myself playing it all the time. Silly fun that takes skill and thought to beat the levels, but not so much that it can't be done.
B001DB0HG2|5.0|This is a great read after the Harry potter series. I loved Harry potter and was delighted to find something to hold my attention just the same.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|I was beginning to think that kindle did not have any good apps. This game has everything a person can want in a game. Best of all, no ad interruptions. There is always room for growth, but right now this is the best game I've played thus far.
0142406112|4.0|My kids who love mystery books are drawn to this series. They love the suspense and clues to figure out the mystery.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|If you don't love this book then you are a poopyface. That is all. Thank you John Green. This book has changed me.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|We watched the movie last night.  It was very enjoyable, and as how both my husband and myself are desended from Scottish ancestors it was even more enjoyable.  As we have learned before, the early Scotsmen were pretty wild, just as the movie portrayed.  I want to watch it again.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I chose this rating because I love this book, the characters, and the action. I especially love the way that the book was paced. My three favorite characters are Jace, Magnus Bane, and Clary.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|good game but tiles are small. would be better on yhe bigger screen. still very playable and a lot of fun
B004FEL6GO|5.0|Excellent. I highly recommend this product. Very easy to use and handle, your kid will love it and want to play with it all the time
B008JGSM6G|4.0|If you like puzzle games this is for you have fun playing it .....why do ya need to write such a long reveiw .....really
B008SVS3FC|5.0|Every song is excellent.  Loved it from start to finish and listen to it from beginning to end, over and over.<br />Makes me smile, made me cry....not unexpected--John Hiatt is a great story teller and never disappoints.
B004O3YGMC|4.0|splashtop is great. it allows me to see what is going on on my computers, which is very helpful. it's like using a computer from your kindle. the only problem is that sound from the computer does not come through the kindle. other than that it is a great app.
B008B3MZNI|5.0|Finally, one of the best live albums of all time comes to life on video. Although the image quality is understandably poor because of the date it was filmed, it is still very enjoyable and interesting. Seeing Goodbye Stranger and Child Of Vision being performed during the Paris dates makes me understand  why the tracks were left off of the original album, since those performances are not as exacting and precise as the songs that were included on the original album. As a whole, it is apparent that the older material that they included on the album was more rehearsed Than the Breakfast in America cuts. Supertramp still shine as live performers though and go through their considerably complex material like the skilled masters that they are. It is a real pleasure to see all of these songs being played live. Buyer beware that the performances included are from different date than those included on the live album that was officially released way back when, but the performances here are just as good as those. It is a real pleasure to see all of the band members playing their parts and to see how they give their absolute all to give the most impassioned show they can muster for the film and live audio recording. My only complaint is that the extra cuts that were included were presented in an audio only format and were taken from other performances in Paris during the same tour. I have no qualms to seeing songs from different sets included, as long as they were still in Paris, but I want to see the band playing them. Instead they glossed them over with cheesy cartoons. I especially miss the performance is Ain't Nobody But Me.<br /><br />All in all, it's still a great, satisfying buy. Any fans of this awesomely talented band will still love this video. I highly recommend it. I don't know that buying the Blu-ray version made any difference in video quality, but it might affect audio. I can only hope that this video may bring Roger Hodgson back into the fold for one more album...  Well, probably not
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|Drives me crazy in a fun way.<br />Very challenging.<br />All Angry Birds games are fantastic and pretty frustrating at the same time.
B007Q0OUNA|2.0|What's Great:<br />1.  Contains characters not in the other sets.<br />2.  I won't insult you by listing all the great features of Lego products, and the LOTR sets!  :)<br /><br />What's Not:<br />1.  Deviates from book and movie in lay out and story features.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I like this game. It reminds me a lot of the Mario games. The kids really enjoy it and I enjoy the relax time I get when they are playing!
B002M89UMW|5.0|A classic film about life at the turn of the century (1900) with fantastic music and good acting!  Worth watching, especially around the Holidays.
B00ARAN9JW|1.0|It stunk.  And I own the 4 previous ones.  This one had NO character development and just recycled old stuff from the other movies.
B000R7I3LY|5.0|Sara has a fabulous voice and a true gift for song writing! If you don't know her music you should take a listen!<br />She appeals to ALL age groups!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Love this app.  It gives you great details on time you have for video and such.  Can't beat for free!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Looked all over, but I had yet to find a mahjong electronic game that I liked, until now.  This is very nice.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|more than a simple clock its an alarm and you may customize it to your needs and desired days and times. its the only one I have although I think they could be more creative with the graphics and looks on this app. I recommend it.
B008IGP8QE|5.0|You know you picked the right present, when your grandson sees what it is and gives the hand pull down in the air and says YES!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|The kids love it! They are so happy that santa brought them a kindle fire and for the free angry birds app. I may have to download more angry birds apps soon.
B004MPESSY|5.0|One of the best movies I have seen in awhile. The rape scenes were extremely graphic and hard to watch but at the same time it shows the honesty and the pure pain of what that type of act does to a woman. Her revenge was amazing. I don't want to spoil anything but by the end of this movie, you understand why she did it plus you want to be her friend.
1450400957|5.0|As a personal trainer, I found more information in this book than in my text.  A must have book for everyone!
8862931921|5.0|If you haven't had an A4 notebook before: it's bigger than your normal \\"large\\" or \\"extra-large\\" moleskines. I prefer a large page for my work, so this is perfect. It is bulky if you're on the go, but personally I don't mind.<br /><br />Some of it's other great features:<br /><br />1. Paper quality: improved over past moleskin notebooks. A little thicker, it can take a gel pen, unlike older moleskines, without bleeding or feathering problems. This is a huge improvement! I'm a dedicated Zebra Sarasa pen user, and this a great page for use with the Sarasa. Writing on this paper is pure pleasure.<br /><br />2. Hard-bound and very well built, and still has the classic moleskin features like the page marker, elastic strap on the binding, and pocket in the back. Lays flat without trouble. Very well constructed.<br /><br />3. Size: again, if you like a roomy page, this is quite a bit bigger than past moleskines and will delight.<br /><br />I loved mine so much I bought three more. I hope the improvements in construction and paper quality make their way to the rest of the moleskine product line.<br /><br />UPDATE: it's been a year now, and this is still my go-to notebook. In fact, I have five of them - 2x A4 Plain, 1x A4 Squared, and 2x A3 Plains.
B005S9EJ14|3.0|I'd heard good comments about this film, including the librarian where I checked it out. The plot involves a small group of unlikely older travel companions uprooting themselves from England and going together to India. One for faster access to a hip replacement operation, another was a retired high-level judge seeking his prior male lover, several singles, and a couple whose marriage had become strained. They're all headed for the same hotel, The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, run by the youngest son of the recently deceased owner - he's well-intentioned, but far more glib talk than reality.<br /><br />The hotel's finances, as well as its hold on these new guests (its only guests) are headed for collapse; similarly, the manager's romance with a young girl his mother forbids marriage to. Eventually most everyone's problems are resolved (the judge dies after finding his former lover, now married), and the hotel's future is saved by the thinking and commitment of the woman originally most unhappy with India.
B000003TAR|3.0|I LOVE THIS BEAUTIFUL GREAT THANKS JE JE JE JE J JE JE J JE JE JE JE JE JE
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I couldn't put it down.  Just the right amount of tension and<br />am glad there are sequels because  l am hooked.
B00594XOZU|5.0|Hey! Kik me at the name above(: been called pretty before but you decide(: shoo yea(: I'm 15, I'll talk to pretty much everyone just I'm supper bored!
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|This case is very good. It's very sturdy and I've had it for a little over a year and it still looks great. Very good quality (and affordable) product. Very happy.
B005DOKL3E|4.0|I bought this when I bought the Kindle Fire. I wanted to protect our new Kindle unit and an easy way to carry it around. Why did I buy this particular item? My wife liked the color.<br /><br />The sleeve is well made. i would recommend it to others.
B000I8HIR2|5.0|Try not to keep disasters like Doom in your mind when thinking of games getting made into movies.  Even Final Fantasy: Spirits Within wasn't terrible when you consider that the makers of the movie were likely pushed to design the movie to be accessible and relatable to a wider audience.  While it captured the same emotion of the games, it didn't really hit that spot of reproducing the same feelings the game elicits<br /><br />Silent Hill does.  It may not have been as wickedly scary as the games, however in a much shorter span of time, they managed to hit that sweet spot and capture exactly what made the games fantastic...cool music, freaky scares, a deeply intriguing backstory of the town's inherent supernatural problems, etc.<br /><br />Really great movie here that both makes the games' canon more interesting, and is made more interesting by the games.  Well done.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Was so glad that i finally read this book! starting book two immediately!! Overall this book exceeding my expectations and i am ecstatic about that!
B008K6HN8I|5.0|High recomended, one of the best explorer for android so far. Developers keep updating this to include new funtions. Give a try it.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|I received this movie in good time and condition, as it was new.  I had scratched the disc that I borrrowed from a neighbor, and had to replace it.  Thank you.
B00000JBFW|5.0|Their best album since Machine Head.  All Deep Purple fans need this CD. The oringinal members did another bang up job!
0375507256|5.0|Absolutely love the way David Mitchell plays with style, words and world. Connestion between parts is very clever. Funny, dramatic, vivid stories resonate on the deepest strings of a soul. Highly recommended to every admirer of a good literature.
B009HELT3C|4.0|I heard other reviews that didnt think too much. I thought it was pretty good and took on new characters with a new and different twist. I will consider buying after renting this...
1421550644|5.0|I got this for christmas and it is everything I wanted. The books are bound very nicely and the print quality is excellent!
B0052FDRI0|3.0|Not my type of music, was a gift who really liked it though, will give 3 stars for that reason.
B009D0LBRO|4.0|This app lags quite a bit in comparison with the Samsung galaxy note 2. They might be because of the quad core processor in the note 2 but it's quite noticeable.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This is a really good book.I would recommend this book to anyone who is wimpy fan!!!<br />So you fans out there I think you should read the book.
0802473156|5.0|Love this book!  Easy book to read and understand.  Very helpful as a parent and a teacher!  Actually would be helpful for all to read!<br /><br />Shipped quickly.
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|I can honestly say that the book was better than the movie, they took out some scenes from the book to make the movie, like in the movie there wasn't anything about smoking, but overall awesome book to read :)
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|The book was pretty good I just wish there was some not ed stuff going on. Not yet worth 7 bucks.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This is a very good book, I would recommend it to anyone. It's simply amazing, read it read it it.
B0076DELIG|3.0|Have most of Michael Connelly's book, this one was okay, but not as good as others I have read.  I found it hard to read, I was frequently reading pages over to make sense of other things mentioned later on.
B003WUYRGI|4.0|Coolio, cool cool cool cool, well it said I needed 18 more words, so blah blah blah blah blahblah blah blah blaun blah blah
B009MCRHH6|5.0|I really like this game! It's too cute and makes you think! My kids really like it and husband too.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I finished the book in about a day. I couldn't put it down. It was amazing. Simply a great story for any age to enjoy.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This one seems so easy at first, then after a few levels you can't just fly through it so easily anymore lol. I love it, it makes the brain work unlike a lot of other pointless games.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|It was decent at first, but as you scroll down the news feed, it suddenly ends and you get no more news. You also can't click on the people once the end of the news feed comes, it turns grey and is basically useless because you can't even click the persons name to go to their Facebook. So it's decent I suppose, but needs a little work to be compared to Facebook or mobile.
B0043GAZYS|5.0|The first time I saw it felt like this movie had everything and was made for me... I keep thinking it
B006YTTVHO|1.0|This little book has some pretty basic stuff on interaction with strangers.  It is a quick easy read and you can't beat the price.
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|The deleted scenes left everything so clear and made me think what the hell was thinking Ridley Scott when he leave them out.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Great game. Ads between levels aren't too bad. Definitely good as a free download. Would recommend to others. Give it a try.
0525478817|4.0|I just hate this like cover books and with out it is just some mysterious black thing... Not a fan of the plasting but loving the book it self :)
B0038BBA4I|5.0|I listen to this album everyday, and its great music to listen to, sing along to, and just feel down to your soul. Everyone that I have introduced this album to are instant fans and get it right away! I know everyone who listens to this will enjoy these guys singing and playing!
B00A757EFW|4.0|this is fun !  i just acquired a kindle fire and i chose this game to start with.  good choice !!!!!!
B009A3NGF4|5.0|I listen to these guys everyday, I will wait is prob one of my all time fav songs! I could listen to these guys anytime.
1573301183|5.0|This is one of the best concerts I've ever bought on dvd. Alice In Chains put on a hell of a show, hauntingly beautiful, but watching it is a little sad knowing how things ended for Layne Staley. A must have for any Alice In Chains fan.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|pretty fun mind game that both my gf and I very much enjoy. I also like that you can use it for free.
B004EPZ084|5.0|When I saw ads for this movie I could not have been less interested. After discovering It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia and laughing uncontrollably at Charlie Day, I finally decided to give Horrible Bosses a chance. Despite low expectations I really enjoyed this movie!<br />Horrible Bosses is definitely not for everyone. Fans of shows like Always Sunny & Arrested Devolpment will appreciate this movie more than people who aren't into such demented humor. The cast was great, the bosses truly were horrible (Jennifer Aniston was so evil!). It was a fun movie to watch.<br />Definitely not the funniest movie I've ever seen but it's easily the funniest movie I've seen that was made in the last decade. More special features would've been nice. The dvd only has deleted scenes. Didn't even mess with the Ultraviolet copy, i have nothing to use it on and it sounds like a pain in the ass anyway. I give Horrible Bosses a 9.5 out of 10.
B005GSZZ1A|4.0|Great insight on North Korea and the cruelty of this totalitarian country's practices. Since the book was written by Hardin, it doesn't bring as much of Shin as I'd like. But well worth reading.
B009VL299E|4.0|Metallica is my favorite band and they did a fantastic job during these shows but there is a major issue with this concert; the editing. You can literally sit there and count to 2 or sometimes 3 and the camera angle changes every 2-3 seconds on the nose. After watching the first 4 songs my eyes hurt. I hope this trend of choppy editing stops soon because it's annoying, distracting and head ache inducing.<br />At least this dvd is priced fairly and there is a great selection of songs. Most people say this about Enter Sandman but I'd rather hear almost any other song than Seek & Destroy for the thousandth time. Motorbreath, Wherever I May Roam, Leper Messiah, And Justice For All, anything but Seek & Destroy AGAIN.<br />I give Metallica 5 stars for their kick ass performance but the editing knocks my overall score down to 4 stars.
B004Z2TUGE|5.0|Enjoyable scifi and teen movie.  Lots of good action.  Wish they had done the part two but hear that's been shelved.
B0086700CM|5.0|very good. addictive. glad its free. wish it would come out with a second one.love it. I wish when I write this it didn't have to be over 13words
B002M9WW30|5.0|La presentaci&oacute;n del estuche es buena aunque debieron incluir alg&uacute;n folleto ya que s&oacute;lo vienen las 6 pel&iacute;culas y un disco extra que es como una trivia de Rocky. Las pel&iacute;culas son muy buenas, las recomiendo.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|What can you say?  Greatest TV series ever!!  Highly recommend it.  I plan to go back and rewatch before the final season starts.
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|Worth the $1.99 rental price. Glad I didn't go to the theater when it was released earlier this past year
B001RTSPVY|5.0|What can you say?  Greatest TV series ever!!  Highly recommend it.  I plan to go back and rewatch before the final season starts.
B000003TA2|3.0|Maybe it is just me but when I searched vinyl record I thought that when this was the first thing that came up that, that is what I would get but instead I got CDs.
B0058YPG1G|5.0|What can you say?  Greatest TV series ever!!  Highly recommend it.  I plan to go back and rewatch before the final season starts.
B0071T4BVC|3.0|This would never get anywhere if it weren't released by Paul. I enjoy it, but Paul's voice has always been better at full volume and he appears to be slowing down a bit. For an aging rocker doing American Standard Pop, I still prefer Rod Stewart's rawness.
B00574Q7PQ|4.0|Movie keeps your interest throughout, although very typical Liam Neeson role where he is on the search for &#34;something.&#34; Difficult to keep this and the &#34;Taken&#34; franchise separate.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|great game i love it it.  frustrating sometimes but i cant stop playing it the coins coming from the roof kinda thru me at first. it just kills me to use 4 coins to win one but im hoping to figure it out and get better.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Did not like the app I deleted it quickly, does  not load statuses, only loads 4 then there are just a few blue boxes and then nothing else, the app really doesn't work, hope you get it fixed then I will download it again.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Excellent debut novel! An amazing overflow of emotions! A witty description of characters, a plot with unexpected twists and turns. Look forward to Point of Retreat!
B0086700CM|5.0|This is a very fun game. It has hours of gameplay because of the achievements and upgrade shop, and is easy to learn.
B009SCRERI|5.0|Both my 7 year old daughter and 5 year old son really enjoyed this movie.  They are pretty sensitive to &#34;scary&#34; parts or characters and this movie did not have any that were too intense.
1454901276|5.0|a dark and beautifully written novel, very evocative of the Western Isles.  The book is well constructed and well researched.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|This is such a good CD.  I don't think there is a single song that we don't like on the whole thing.  Highly recommend.
B001U887XI|5.0|I love these shoes. Very comfortable & cozy. You'll need to order a size smaller though. I ordered these Crocs one size bigger than what I normally wear because I thought they would be too small being they have fleece inside, but they're actually a bit bigger. I still wear them though. I wear these shoes mostly in the late Fall, Winter & early Spring. Whenever it's cold outside. I never wear socks with them, because my feet love the feeling of the fleece inside.<br />I have since ordered a pair in my real size & they fit perfectly. Those I wear while out shopping or whatever errands I need to do. I even wear them while out with friends. I still wear the bigger size, but only around the house.<br /><br />I highly recommend these shoes to everyone!!!
B007GCY8FS|4.0|A wanted man has an Excellent plot. Well written, as usual. Kept me up late one night. Woud reread sometime.
B007NN3TDW|5.0|This is a great Judas Priest album, and showcases old metal and the sound of the time. I think 80s music is always great and this is definitely a great addition to any collection.
0375850864|5.0|I love this book so much!! I read it back in 8th grade, and I definetely recommend it to middle schoolers. You will absolutely love this book and you won't regret reading it. It's the most mysterious book I have ever read. It has so many things in it, friendship, love, family, everything.. I encourage parents to show this book to their children, it's very enjoyable. :D
B0063GORYU|4.0|Statistic summary is not as complete or as clear as the laptop program.  Touch screen seems overly sensitive - will take getting use to using.
B006QS07IK|1.0|This book was a torture for me. I mean adults might like it but as a highschooler, NOOOO!! I mean it's not just me a lot of my friends thought that it was a horrible book. Though you can't blame us. We're 21st century teens. 19th century is a bit old and boring for us.
B009P5S11G|5.0|i love love love Rihanna so i knew from the get go that i would have been very happy with this purchase.<br /><br />i have all 7 albums now and cant wait for her to produce another one :)
0142420891|4.0|I'm glad this book ended good. It's a really nice love story. I didn't quite understand who was telling the story at the beginning but I eventually caught up. I would recommend this book to young readers like me. It's quite enjoyable :)
0802473156|4.0|i did the online quiz<br /><br />then i bought this book to get a better understanding of the languages<br /><br />so far so good :)
0380807343|4.0|I read this book when I was in 7th grade. And now I'm in 10th grade. I love reading and this was one of my favorite books in 7th grade. It's full of mystery, in fact it's one of the three most mysterious books I have ever read. I recomend it to anyone in middle school who is looking for an exciting reading time full of adventure!
0810989956|5.0|I bought this for my 8 yr old niece for Christmas and she loved it.  She ignored all other gifts and immediately requested a pen and started working on the book's activities.  It sits by her bed on her night stand, that says it all.
0810993139|3.0|I have read these books a few years ago when I was in middle school, they were pretty good back then. What I mean is I enjoyed them back then, but now I can't believe how I read them at the first place. Overall though, they're okay to read if you're younger than 12.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This is the most useful app! I've tried springpad also, but it's looking too much like pinterest. Evernote is so easy to use! I can save web pages, bits of web pages, take notes, pictures of things to remember, and they are easy to find when I look for them later!
014241543X|4.0|I really liked this book, I only didn't give it five stars because I have read better books. So it just didn't seem fair to give it five stars when the others got five too. It was really sad, and filled with love. I recommend this book to young readers like me. :)
B0083DJWGO|5.0|When I read the book (I have also read \\"Fooled by Randomness\\" and \\"The Black Swan\\") once again I found that it conformed to what I have observed going on in the world around me but couldn't put into words and didn't put together myself. Reviewers criticize Taleb's arrogance, divisiveness, etc., however they choose to put it, but that has nothing to do with whether his world view is accurate or not. Again, from what I have seen going on around me for decades, his world view is right on. Read his books and save yourself a lot of trouble. Plus, I find them not only very educational and eye opening, but fun.
1400032717|1.0|I HATE THIS BOOK WITH ALL MY HEART. Don't get me wrong I love reading but this book was absolutely a torture for me, in fact it is the only book I hate. I have read more than 90 books just this year and I actually had to read this for english class, otherwise I wouldn't have read it at all. I mean I just could not conect with the narrator. Just like, No! I tried but I do not get how such a human being could exist. No jokes, no love, no believe in God or anything that is not logical. I don't understand how someone can live like that. I don't recommend this book to anybody. I do not understand how it became a best seller or how people recommend it to each other, and give four stars for it. But I'm happy knowing that I discourage people to read this. I especially tell people to never read this book. But other than this book, I love any other book I have ever read. Thank you!
B0015DROBO|5.0|I am on my second round of reading the Millennium Trilogy. I have seen all three Swedish movies and David Fincher's American movie of this title and greatly enjoyed them all. &#34;The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo&#34; is a first-rate mystery plus a social commentary on the victimization of many women in Sweden that doesn't interfere with the story at all (the original title in Swedish is &#34;Men Who Hate Women&#34;).<br /><br />Lisbeth Salander is one of the most unique characters in fiction. She has been victimized since childhood but refuses to play the role of a victim. She is the perfect foil of the protagonist Mikael Blomkvist, an investigative journalist hired to look into the disappearance of a young woman 30-some years before. Salander is a Goth, a loner, a hacker, and a supremely talented researcher. Blomkvist takes her on as his research assistant when the job he is hired for starts to get complicated and dangerous.<br /><br />This is a long book (over 650 pages) and a wild ride. You will be glad it is that long as you don't want it to be over once you've started it. I can't recall a modern work of fiction I have enjoyed more than the Millennium Trilogy. All 2000 pages of it. However, this book works fine as a stand-alone novel. There are no loose ends at the end.
B000NQRE1E|4.0|Better price fom Amazon than in the stores at $25.00 ,picture on Blu/Ray is very crip and clean .The sattilite Tv worked this movie to death when it was new ,so it is the bonus features that had me purchase this version which explains the making of the film and gives the forensic evidence as to the why of the disaster,so its well worth the money for the 4 disc set .
B0049P1VHS|5.0|The first season, can I say anything else... I gave this as a gift and was well received so that is all that mattered.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Only complaint is that it does not give you the option to play a winning deal like the apt does on my phone. But its free so who cares?!
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|The second season, can I say anything else... Was a little expensive but I gave this as a gift and was well received so that is all that mattered.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|I GOT THIS AS A GIFT, MY FRIEND LOVES MICHAEL BUBLE AND THIS IS ONE REALLY GOOD X-MAS CD AND THE PRICE WAS GOOD TOO.
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|This movie was made for my video-game-loving Aspie. She has dragged me to the theaters to see it a record five times, and a sixth trip is coming up. Set within the gaming world and allowing characters from different video games to interact, this movie validates the importance of what is most important in my daughter's world.<br /><br />I think this movie exceeded all expectations:<br /><br />1. Despite Christmas releases, it is still in the theaters.<br /><br />2. A sequel is in the works.<br /><br />3. GameStop only stocked one copy of the Wreck-It Ralph Wii game in each of their stores. A week or two after we bought ours for $30, we received a \\"buy back\\" e-mail for $15. I smell shortage.<br /><br />My daughter enjoys counting the Sonic the Hedgehog appearances throughout the movie. (There are quite a few, but most so brief that you'd better not blink.) She loves her Felix plushie. She's written ten chapters of a fan fiction. She walks around chortling to herself about the Felix/Calhoun romance. In short, she is really engaged with this movie.<br /><br />It also really engaged her emotions. When Ralph has his big destructive moment with Vanellope (I'm trying not to be too specific), she was in tears and turned to me and said, \\"I don't like how this is making me feel.\\" But of course there was redemption.<br /><br />The film is also not horrid for adults to sit through, and that's always a major plus. It moves so quickly; the plot cleverly zips along with problem-resolution at break-neck speed. And there are plenty of humorous moments for adults, particularly a Wizard of Oz reference. In every viewing I sat through, the people laughing the loudest were the adult men. And not one adult I've talked to saw the \\"big reveal\\" coming.<br /><br />While after five viewings I believe I've pretty much gotten everything I can out of this movie, I can highly recommend it. Your gamer will love it. Your Aspie will love it. Your guy will love it. And it will not be too onerous for you to sit through. What more can you ask for from a kids' movie?ou to sit through. What more can you ask for from a kids' movie?
B005HSL626|5.0|I received the Kindle Fire HD for Christmas this year from my husband! I have to admit that it was fun sitting down with our daughter passing the Kindle down to the next person to see which one of us could get the highest score!  I love this FREE game and we all enjoy playing it:)
B0087GZ8YW|5.0|Rankin always draws me into his stories and characters. I loved visiting Edinburgh and enjoy reading his stories set in that city.
0525952926|5.0|This book is exceptional.  Ken Follett is a master story teller and brings to light the horror as well as the sublime in World War II,  War is always bad but he tells the human stories also.
B000YHG72E|5.0|Anything with Will Ferrell is phenomenal!  Funny and it has a nice message to it too.  Definitely a must see!
B000002H97|5.0|Most Metallica fans will tell you that the 'black album' is THE Metallica album to have. It has all the classics that you know and love. With the hundreds of songs they've put out over the decades, this is by far STILL my fav CD! Long live rock!
B000XUBFE2|4.0|I picked this book up to read with my 9th grader. He is in an advanced English class in high school. I was surprised at what a great read it was. Could not put it down.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I've never heard of these 'Piano Guys' until I began looking for instrumental music. Like all the other reviews, all I can say is, &#34;Wow!&#34;  This CD is awesome! How the 2 instruments can work so well together is amazing!<br />I'm one of those people who cannot listen to talking/singing while working. I have to have instrumental music playing through my MP3 at work. I'm always looking for good instrumental CD's that are relaxing, uplifting, and pleasant. This CD fits the bill.
B007VPLNGW|5.0|My grankids all like this one also!  I have played it with them and it's a lot of fun!to play
B0068TL23G|5.0|Router is one of the best puzzle games I have ever played.  Very entertaining and unique.  The game has a ton of levels and the user is significantly challenged by the game's puzzles in the higher levels.<br /><br />Highly Recommend for anyone who is a fan of Puzzle Games!!!
B007S3S8HO|1.0|This was our first experience with any type of KNEX. The main fun for our 8 and 5 year old boys was shooting the birds across the room with the &#34;slingshot.&#34; Very disappointed with the quality as the KNEX blocks barely hold together even enough to get the pig &#34;house&#34; set up. Makes for a more entertaining result when hitting the setup with the birds, but my kids, seeing the trouble it took to set it up initially, didn't even want to set it back up after knocking it down once, and one of them is an avid Legos fan. Save your money or buy them a nice Lego set instead.
B0058YPG2K|5.0|I'm going to keep this brief. Buy it, 5/5, it's that good. Not only is this the best thing on TV, but the best thing from an entertainment stand point. Believe the hype, Breaking Bad is phenomenal.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|App only loads 10 statuses. I use the web browser on the kindle instead of this annoying app. Stinks to have to use the web when you should be able to use the app.
B004EK926K|5.0|This is an amazing film.  Great job by Jim Carrey in so many roles, I didn't even realize it until the credits!  Animation and reality at its best.  I don't think this is a film for small children as realistic as the ghosts were portrayed probably would be a little frightening for them.  I've seen this in 3D and was amazed how well the HD version matched the scenes - could picture it in 3D.  I would recommend this film to all adults!
B00AJRQLTI|4.0|I made sevetal attempts to purchase this mp3 and was redirected at least 3times. I was finally able to make my purchase but am not sure if i cohld do it again. I enjoyed the music and look forward to seeing the movie.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|tot awesome ness it lets me talk and bond  with my sis even when she is so far away I liv it thank you creaters woooho
B0073RQMBY|5.0|I'm so glad my son has fallen in love with Schleich and has collected this for probably eight years now. They're well made and never get out dated.
B0060FXBNM|4.0|all as described, new in box, individually wrapped, all played fine on ps3....thank you for the offer..I can't think of anything else to say.
B0063IH60K|4.0|As addictive as the pc version you spent too much school time on. easy to use and great fun.<br />perfect on kindle fire
B007THA4FI|2.0|JK Rowling was obviously trying to distance herself from Harry Potter.  She paints an overly rich picture of a lower-middle class town and the seamy details of the lives of her characters.  Unlike the Potter tales, which were hard to put down, this story was slow-going and unsatisfying.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Awesome. The ended was slightly vague, but gave enough detail so you're not too pissed. I love how it was a nice easy read with depth.
B007TXN4TK|2.0|It might be fine if there was any type of introduction explaing how the &#34;game&#34; is played.  I was really looking for a straight piano program, not a game.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|Desde años que veo documentales con la narración de David Attenborough, y este no decepciono, es un excelente documental y muy recomendado para aprender mas de nuestro planeta, espero que muchos tengan la oportunidad de adquirir este producto, ademas el envío como siempre excelente de parte de amazon, totalmente recomendado.
B00785P2QC|4.0|great fun and easy too use . anyone who enjoyed the old SIM cities games will live this while waiting for the bus
159420229X|5.0|I learned about memory in interesting ways. It had a story line as well as good information. It was also well written.
B002GHHHKQ|4.0|I purchased this movie as a gift to my boyfriend so first, the price was unbeatable and he absolutely LOVES anything to do with space and wouldn't hush up about this movie. I finally saw it with him and was definitely blown away. Jodie Foster is an amazing actress and the movie itself really gets you thinking about the \\"what if's\\" in life and in space. As scary as it is to think stuff like that could exist, it was definitely thrilling to watch, slow to start but definitely a must see. The movie arrived in a timely manner and was packaged nicely.
0451450523|3.0|I DID CHOOSE THIS RATING , THE PRODUCT IT IS OKAY BUT MY KIDS LIKE MORE THE MOVIE TO READ SOMETHING .
B005WUHAX8|1.0|Purchased a Lifeproof Case for Iphone for my mother for christmas. When I went to put it on her phone the piece came off the inside where the phone ringer turns on and off also no head phone adapter inside box.I emailed company and the responce was the case is tricky to put on and my return had to be in 7 days nice way to do business durning the holidays.this review is meant for the company newwaveelectronics
B005LAIH4A|5.0|THIS IS IT A WONDER MOVIE TO YHE KIDS AN THE VALUE TOO! VERY GOOD MESSAGE TO THE HUMANITY AND GOOD GIFT FOR CHRISTMAS.
0143117130|3.0|Nice read, but there's not much to say. I ended comparing this to the movie nonstop, since I've watched the movie like million and one times! And I must admit, both have pros and cons. Book had less embarrassing moments, when the movie was filled with embarrassment. But the movie had more scenes with Darcy and Daniel, which I missed in the book.<br />I think I like the movie better, since I'm going to watch it yet again this Christmas (because you just have to watch it when it's Christmas!), but I don't see myself reading this again.<br /><br />Oh, and I was all confused when there was all this talk about answering machines etc.! Then I had to check out when this came out, and realized I was only about 10 years old back then, and cellphones came few years later, so no wonder they didn't have cellphones..<br />But huge plus for the fact that this was written ages ago, yet still didn't feel outdated. Except for the part about answering machines.<br /><br />Love,<br />Monaliz @ Mind Reading?
B000Q67876|5.0|Fantastic - my favorite movie. Nice to have it in blu-ray. Good price but wish it also had the digital copy included.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Jewels Star is an eye catching game. Fun to play if you just have a few moments or if you have an hour. It's addicting and challenging.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|Fantastic movie. Nice to have both type of blu-ray and DVD plus the extras. Good price but wish it also had the digital copy included.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Purchased for my 10year old and he impressed me with &#34;getting&#34; strategy of the game quickly.  After the first day of playing, I can't say that he plays it over and over but for a free game that makes him think - a once in a while use is worth it.
B000VEA38E|5.0|my husband has always enjoyed the Star Wars music ever since the late '70's, but this cd had a fantastic sound and wonderful music!!.
B000RLHDUM|5.0|It's Pierce!!  Are you kidding? I've been getting every film or series I can get my hands on.  Was in Navan last time in Ireland!
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|it ok challenging but it is short don't have enough levels. I got it for free not sure I would pay for it.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|This book was hard to put down,which to me, speaks for itself. This tale of Jacob and the peculiar children is full of suspense and interesting characters. Honestly, just read it!
B0063IH60K|1.0|This App pops up full screen ads all the time.  Do not install this on your device.  I removed it.  Hopefully the ads will stop.
B004G600A4|5.0|I gave it as a present and my niece really liked it and watched it with others in my family immediately on Christmas day.
B0093OGBL6|5.0|I just got my copy of your book, Karen, through Kindle. Very excited about it and can't wait to start reading it. Judging by most of the reviews so far, it is definitely a wonderful book, and an act of love toward Michael. Thank you so much for writing this book, and making it available to those of us who might not otherwise have been able to get it. God bless you, Karen.
B005D9MUWY|4.0|CANT update to 3.1. Amazon app store hasn't updated the app yet,  however 3.1 is on Google Play. I don't know what they're waiting for!

B004SMDJ9U|5.0|THE BOX SET OD DVD'S IS REALLY NICE. THE PICTURES ARE VERY GOOD. I WAS VERY PLEASED WITH THIS PURCHASE.
1449410243|4.0|This is an illustrated book that is perfect for kids 10+ years old.  I bought it as a joke for my brother-in-law but my Granddaughter absolutely loves it.  It also has a pull out poster for the symptoms.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This game is addictive and so much fun!!!!<br />This is my go to game when I tire from any other game and I never get tired of this game. Love it!!!
B009LREA1S|5.0|Dark Knight Rises should go down as a near perfect ending to a riveting trilogy. The story kept to the original concept of the Batman books. Buy, instead of renting, as you will want to see it again.
B009LIQ55G|4.0|First live Pogue album since the Brixton concert, released on the 2005 Ultimate Collection (with some of the show added to the \\"Kiss My...\\" box set.\\"<br />Now musically that concert was great, but was let down by MacGowan's dreadful vocals (admitted he's never had the best set of pipes in the business), but they really do detract from the gig.<br />But with \\"..In Paris\\" Shane's voice has improved enough to make this concert an enjoyable listen.<br />I would class it as a nostalgia concert; there are no new songs, or radical re-workings of any of their classics, but there still enough enthusiasm to carry the show along quite nicely (although the between-song banter with the French audience is hardly Freddie at Wembley, & Shane talking French is certainly something to behold!).<br />So if you're new to the music of The Pogues, it wouldn't be my first stop, but a decent bookend to their career.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I have only gotten through one of the four books so far, but I just loved it!  A time of kings, lords, dragons, and swordplay.  The action, adventure, and story line grab you right from the start.  There are characters to love, some to hate, and some to watch--uncertain if they will be a champion or a weasel.  I have just started book two and again--it pulled me in immediately; I truly just need more reading time here!  Give these books a try--I don't think you will be sorry.  (Oh--and there is an HBO series based on the books--that has started out amazing as well!!)
B008G12ERC|5.0|Muse really did change their style for this album but it's really good! they do sound a bit different but they still stayed true to how they used to play! it's wonderful and MUSER will love it! in my opinion it was way better than Resistance!
B003VANOFY|3.0|This product was ordered new and purchased as a gift for Xmas. To my surprise and the one receiving it, the product's seal was already opened and had shown signs of use from a previous owner. Terrible disappoint from a company that prides itself in quality of product and service. I don't doubt the expansive reviews from others that this is a great product, but the fact that it was purchased new but used is a disappointment I cannot overlook.<br /><br />Amazon Support had taken care of this predicament and will be issuing me a refund. By no means should this stop you from ordering from Logitech, since this is just my personal experience (hence, the 3 stars).
B0083SBM7Q|5.0|I got this as a gift for my father and it was great! the blue ray and DVD thing really comes in handy. now he really can watch it any where, plus the shipping was good
1597771007|5.0|I skipped the movie because it looked like a boring chick flick. This audiobook was in my library so I checked it out, thinking maybe I missed something. I certainly did. The book traces a mistake made by a 13-year-old that dramatically affects the lives of her sister and her lover. It is the equivalent of the tragedy of Romeo and Juliette.<br /> It's not a detective story but one of lyrics and prose and a style so elegant. There are so many vivid descriptions, particularly about Dunkirk, and subtleties. The true villains become clearer later in the book and the answer is so perceptive about the truth and sadness of life itself. The final part made me cry for a life unfulfilled.<br />If you love England and great books and audiobooks, this will not disappoint. I can hardly give any higher praise to the actress who read the book; it's among the five best I've ever heard.
B0086700CM|5.0|Keeps you occupied and definately leaves you wanting more. Its fun and engaging and requires very little of a learning curve. Fun right out of the temple.
B006FE83UE|5.0|I needed this DVD. To Kill A Mockingbird is my favorite movie but I only had it on VHS. It sat on my wish list for a few months before I purchased it. It is such a wonderful story and I'm glad to be able to add it to my collection.
B000T433CO|4.0|Great cast does a smart job with this script. Lots of fun.  I'm sure it will be classified as a &#34;chick flick&#34; but everyone can enjoy this and will.  It's really a good movie.
B0053O89IS|4.0|I ordered this online because it was on sale.  I have all the DVD's from previous season.  I was just completing my collection.
B0001GL3K4|5.0|Not an Oscar winner but has become my favorite movie.  Superb ensemble cast delivers beautiful, underplayed performances and the clever direction and editing have made this a movie that will be enjoyed a long time.  Many would call this movie a &#34;sleeper&#34; but I think it deserves to stand front and center for its unique exploration of many themes that seem to surface during the Holidays.  And it does so, wonderfully, compassionately, and completely.  If you've never seen this movie, then you have missed a really good one.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|i got this for my brother for christmas, and he absolutely flipped! great gift i do recommend. it also comes with a book so its a very good price.
B005LAIHYU|3.0|This is a very odd movie.  Why Lincoln?  We watched it as a joke, but no real point to this.
B009VA1FN6|5.0|Kate Morton is one of my farvourite author's. Can't wait for the next. Knew there was a twist to the tale but kept me guessing to the end as to what is was. Beautifull descriptive writing.
B004YM6JLO|5.0|We are the generation that loves vampires. If you do love books about them then you will love this show because it has everything in it. There are unexpected things that happen.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Enjoying this. Very relaxing version of manning solitaire. Do I really need twenty words to review this? I think not.
B0053O89WY|5.0|This is one of my favorite shows. It's one of those shows you can put on at anytime and you will always get a laugh. Who doesn't like laughing?
B009GENZKS|4.0|I'm a Resident Evil fan and had no idea that they'd came out with another part to these movies. It helped explain part 6 a little better with the characters.
B0058YPL66|5.0|This show is so amazing and really makes one think how many twists and turns can you put into a show.
B00ARAO720|3.0|I'm into bicyclying this is good for a 2 hour movie when nothing else is on cable. Not that great of a storyline but doable.
0802473156|5.0|Excellent...I have been married 52 years and I wish I had read this material back when Jewell and I got married 9/30/60.
034580404X|5.0|One thing about this trilogy...you couldn't wait to read the next book. I didn't want to put the book down until I read the next page, so I read them very quickly.
B0006AAS5G|5.0|I shopped and shopped and shopped.  In a nut shell this watch looks good with anything I wear and can be worn in a casual setting or with a suit coat.  The thing I've learned the hard way is that the larger watches don't fit under a dress shirt.  They look great and stand out, but if I wear a long sleeve dress shirt they won't go under the sleeve.  This watch does.  Looks great, feels like a watch of quality and every day I wear it I like it more and more.  All the shopping paid off.
B00APUQT7I|4.0|Watched with a 6, 12 & 14 year old.  It was great, family friendly fun.  Order it for some giggles.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is the most amazing book I ever read I love the hungergames please send me the mocking bird for a free borrow thanks love linda
0345803485|1.0|Can't believe I bought this book. Guess I just wanted to see what all the hype was about. It was sooo boring I couldn't even finish it. I didn't care for the characters at all, and I think a high school kid could have written better. I think only desperate women would find this  titillating.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|This app is amazing. There are so so many features. When you edit your pictures they look so professional! You would expect this app to be like twenty dollars, but really it's free!!! Free! No cost, never closes down, so many different things you can do. Get this App! It's flawless and fast. So amazing!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I read - a lot.  This story grabbed me harder than any have in a long time. Thank you for a wonderful read.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|a great way to kill some time with pony's. easy to learn and play great for all ages and friends.
B004EKCNMA|5.0|A very beautiful executed work that is very faithful to the original Dickens story.  Pure Christmas magic, and perfect for the whole family.  We watch it every year.
B005CGI4EG|2.0|no list of episodes and discs are stacked on top of each other, its a bitch to search for specific episodes without a listing
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This is not what I had expected at all,but it is amazing in all ways, it gets to your heart
0307120007|5.0|My mom gave it to me for my first child and II always give it for a baby shower gift!
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|was a good movie, we thought it was for kids but no. but it was a good movie after all
1612680011|5.0|With my latest purchase, I actually bought 5 copies of the mass market paperback so that I can give a copy to people I care about who would benefit from learning about money and financial freedom.  I highly recommend that everyone read this book.  It is not a how-to book and it is not a 'Get Rich Quick' book.  It teaches the basics of financial literacy and the concepts of how to avoid spending the rest of your life as an employee, making someone else rich.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It is perfect for a kids book because I have felt the same way at a time. They were having a dance at my school and I felt the same way haha!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This season is full of twists, turns, and old friends. I have enjoyed this season, it has been full of action
B003WUYRGI|5.0|I think it is a good thing to read when yhu don't know a word and need to learn something ! This is a very good book
B0075MFS9Y|4.0|This is a difficult album to rate.  When I first listened to it, i thought, okay, so's there about 2 great songs and not much else.  But, the more i've listened to it, the more and more i like the others.  I bought it cause of Ho Hey, and the other songs are different and not as good, but I'm still glad I have it, and I'm starting to appreciate the rest of the album, which, for some reason, i keep playing :)
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book had me sobbing in the most randomness parts. I can very much say that it has me thinking of what could actually happen when people die, beck when I did even. But this book about teenagers with cancer but in love at the same time is a perfect read for those interested in things of those nature.
B006ZCWTXS|5.0|I cannot stop listening to this album!  THE WHOLE THING IS GREAT!!!  I hate when people are constantly comparing everyone to Adele and looking for &#34;the next Adele,&#34; but seriously, this girl is amazing, and so refreshing, given Adele's overexposure.  I especially love the uptempo ending of the album, totally leaves you wanting more.  It's so smooth and soulful, the best R&B album in years.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love game so much it is so addicting if you play it you are sure to love it .
B00APUYN0I|4.0|I like the movie the 1 thing that I wish they had was subtitles for hard of hearing people. the movie stating HD the whole time and have any problems with it buffering.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Safe Haven is a great heartfelt story of love. It is suspenseful and keeps you interested the whole way through.
B006LSZECO|5.0|You never know what is going to happen next and you aren't sure what happened when you finish the book! A real page turner!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book has succeeded to be one of Jeff Kenny's best books. Plot is hilarious  and adventures are great .<br />MUST READ.
B005LAIHY0|5.0|While it does not quite live up to the standard set previously by Ridley's Scott's Alien, this is still a fantastic science fiction movie. The visuals are stunning and the acting is top-notch. The story becomes clearer upon repeated viewings and upon realizing that it is not a direct prequel to Alien but rather only exists in the same universe.
B003ODIZL6|3.0|This book was very confusing but helpful in way. That is why I choose this rating. I would recommend this book to people who like to read and people doing essays.
B005IQZB14|5.0|I loved this book.  Very interesting account of a young woman finding her way through a very difficult time in her life.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book is awesome you should read It to and its really funny especially when it's their Valentine dance it's funny
B0063IH60K|3.0|ads are fine but not when they are forced and hidden.  I majorly dislike that about this app because it makes me feel like my device is vulnerable.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|Very easy and intuitive to use. Similar to Explorer in Windows. It also allows you to access the camara feature for free.
B007WFTFG6|5.0|My friends daughter likes to play on my fire so when I saw this free app I knew she would love it
B007VUCAVO|5.0|I love this monitor. I really like the annoucement that are customizable for different charge levels or when the charge is complete.
B005ZCXPP0|5.0|THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITES!!!! MARVEL IS REALLY DOING GREAT WITH THE AVENGERS SERIES!!!!! :) I WATCH THIS WITH MY FAMILY AND FRIENDS!!!!
B006WQLH7G|3.0|It seems to install and run fine. I'm not so sure it is protecting me from anything. You have to root device for a firewall.
B007XIC1GI|5.0|Loved this book..what a look into the mind and experiences of someone so mysterious and intriguing... I want to say I somewhat understand him, and in other way I don't and it makes me more curious.
B008HK3XKO|4.0|I like this style cover because it makes the Kindle look like a book. It also protects the screen when not in use. It doesn't get a 5 star because you can not use the stand in protrait mode.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|The Facebook app is not even worth downloading for your Kindle! It is actually quite disappointing! There are so many glitches, but the most frustrating is that you can only see the first few posts on your news feed &amp; then the rest do not load. I have already uninstalled the app &amp; won't reinstall until there is an update! AT this  point, it is pointless to have the Facebook app!
B008P1EWIM|5.0|I wanted a clock that was readable on my Fire. This does that plus weather. I'm happy. I got what I wanted.
B008MEM24S|4.0|Fun and quick games make this 99 cent game worth all 99 pennies! Definitely worth it. Good when you only have a little time or can spend a while going level after level.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|What can I say?  I just love this series and it's not one I would normally even consider watching.  But a friend recommended it so I decided to watch it just once and couldn't stop after that.
0545265355|5.0|This was purchased for my 12 year old son for Christmas.<br /><br />The books came delievered on time, the packaging was perfect, and I couldn't be happier with my purchase. 5 stars and 2 thumbs up!
B00AHSMDQY|1.0|I'm very Glad it was on sale.  Turned off half way thru.  It is time to stop batman movies completely.
B00001U0GQ|3.0|This was bought as a gift for Christmas.  I am sure they will enjoy it since they asked for it.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|DVD is part of the 6 Movies in the Harry Potter series...fans should collect all the movies...visual effects spectacular through out the series

B008K6HN8I|5.0|Imprescindible para copiar, pegar y streaming a través de tu propia red. Y lo mejor de todo es que es gratuita!!
B005S39YGU|5.0|The show is as funny as ever, and watching how they all met is a great blast from the past.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This book was ok.  I can't wait to see what happens in the second book.  I give it four stars.
0452273331|5.0|I read Atlas Shrugged first because that's what all the discussions are about.  I had been trying to find the time to read this one, but it's hard, and I figured since all the fanfare is about Atlas this was mediocre in comparison.  I found the book on CD for this at the library and listened to it on the way to work.  Boy was I wrong.  I loved this book, much more than Atlas Shrugged, and I still love Atlas.  It's incredible, so I had to order it right away.  Wonderful.  I flip through it all the time and read the best parts when I'm feeling depressed about current events.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Ever since Avatar appeared in the movies, I was waiting for it to be released on Blu-ray 3D and my wish came true.  It is a wonderful release and for people who have a large screen with surround sound, it is like being at the theater viewing it.  I highly recommend sci-fi fans and people who like an adventure beyond this Earth to get Avatar.  It comes with the 2D version as well at no extra cost.  It is my ultimate show off movie to my friends who are courious about 3D tv.  It wins them over every time.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|Fun, entertaining and lots of extras. My 10 year old and 14 year old both agree this is a great game.
B001RTSPVY|5.0|I love this show with its  great acting  and intriguing plots. Plot continues to grow with more twists and character developments.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|Love the movie only wished the copy I ordered from Amazon had been viewable. Had to return it :-( 5 stars are for the movie
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|i like it - pretty fun and with minimal interruption. graphics are good and picture is crisp and clean. GET it.
B000T433CO|5.0|Most wonderful show of Christmas. Acting great. Plot fanciful and Eli Wallach makes the whole thing complete. I was never a fan of Jude Law and Jack before this movie.  Now I'm sold.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|wont load news feed reinstallling doesnt fix it this thing sucks very annoying kindle may have to go back basic facebook should just work
B002BWP49C|5.0|daughter loves it, great for the young reader that likes to read and would recommend to any one to read.
B000JMLFLW|5.0|Can you ever get enough of Jane Austen? I love having this on my kindle so that I may read it whenever I lie, where ever I am.This is not a book to be read only once.
B0034JKZ86|5.0|I LOVE what Disney came up with this time :) AMAZING<br />to anyone out there with some \\"spiritual\\" thing it does have a \\"witch doctor\\"/ \\"voo doo man\\" but so amazingly done and his VOICE...... wow :)<br /><br />any way LOVE the movie love the songs, and gives way for imagination. :)
B005HSG3VK|5.0|This is a good case, easy to open and close. It protects the screen and because I could order it in a bright pink, it's easy to locate inside my home or my purse!
B0092MKFIY|5.0|In LOVE with this CD! Cant get enough of this band. Heard them on ALT Nation and had to buy the CD!
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Once you start, it's hard to stop. Ridiculously simple and exceedingly challenging at the same time. Easy fun when you have to wait.
B000SGGUWS|5.0|This book was really good. I loved the plot, and just the story in general. I would totally recommend this to teenagers and adults, even.
B00ARAO720|4.0|I was not too excited about it based on the previews but it turned out to be really good.  It's action packed with an good plot.  I reccomend viewing it.
B0086700CM|5.0|Kindle finally got it! This game is very fun and addictive. It also helps pass time faster than most games they sell at the app store.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Great read!!! Well developed characters and plenty of twists and turns. I can't wait to read the rest of  Howey's books!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I saw the movie, before I read the book. Even knowing what was going to happen, I couldn't put the book down. Great read.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|A bit on the creepy side but it is a great game. Of course you have to pay to continue but it's worth it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It was wonderful to read and get so much more out of the book than the movie. Cannot wait to read the next two!
B0086700CM|4.0|this is a  great game, it will keep you on your toes, hours of fun for all ages, good luck beating it
B003O86FMW|5.0|The second book is my favorite out of the trilogy. Lots of great action and unexpected surprises. The ending was perfect!
B005MMJ84K|4.0|The third book is set to be coming out in the month of March in the year 2013. Thank you.
B0091QS88K|4.0|This app is HIGHLY cute :) I've rated it 4 stars because it is too fun, but is not for ages younger than 5. My baby sister hated this game! but its still on my kindle because I find it to be very entertaining.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Like my title says, this book was AMAZING! The detail in every word and sentence, the personalities of each character, and the plot all combine to make this book one of the best I've read.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|This book was good . It wasn't that funny but since I started reading it I couldn't put it down.
B003L77GG0|5.0|Smallville is a series that should not finish. the special effects are really great as I imagine hope will be more of it in the future!
B001BR5NN0|5.0|Nice to see kids actually - talking - with one another as opposed to texting!  Always amazing to see how the world got along without all this technology!
B0083TXXZ4|5.0|This is a big gun.  Great price and a overall good product.  I got the product fast.  My grandson loves it.
B008ELUEQC|4.0|This will go into my top 3-4 Christmas albums.  I especially like the duet with Ceelo Green and the new songs.
B0086213XW|5.0|***MINOR SPOILIERS****<br /><br />I streamed this last night with my wife, and I had to stop it several times during the playback because the conversation between the two of us was causing us to miss out on plot developments. The description on the Amazon had this labeled as both Comedy and Drama, but there is nothing funny about it. Despite it featuring two of the highest profile names in comedy, they are Tom Hanksing it in this film. Don't expect anything remotely similar to Knocked Up.<br /><br />This is a drama that is really a complete destruction of the Romantic Comedy myth that Hollywood seems to put out endlessly. Two crazy kids meet cute and find they have amazing chemistry. They even find out that they happen to be neighbors! Only a slight detail is getting in the way, and its that she's been happily married for five years. This is about what happens after the credits roll and what follows can get pretty bleak.<br /><br />However, all that said it is far from a perfect movie. There are some pretty great scenes in it, particularly two different scenes that both feature the song \\"Video Killed The Radio Star\\" that really stuck with me. Definitely worth your time. The movie deserves its R rating due to nudity and a sequence with graphic depictions of pretty people having sex in fun and creative ways.
B0077PBPJ6|5.0|Ruth Ann Hinson - Florence SC<br /><br />Only two episodes, yet it will demonstrate an European perspective on WWI we don't often get a chance to view.
0525478817|5.0|I'm not a fast reader. Even with a good book it takes me at least a week or more to get through. But I finished this book in less than 12 hrs (would've been less than that but life kept doing that annoying thing of existing and interrupting).<br /><br />Putting aside the beautiful story of the characters for a minute, the writing was flawless. If there was no plot whatsoever I would still curl up and die from the beauty of John Green's prose. He is one of the best. Every page had a paragraph or line I wanted to highlight or tattoo on my forearm to remember forever. Fantastic truths that could resonate with anyone, healthy or sick, young or old.<br /><br />But of course the story, the beautiful, epic tragedy that is Hazel and Augustus. It tore me up, made me think, made me laugh; I wanted to be in the room with them just to observe their crazy, witty yet philosophical debates on even the simplest things. Their love story was beautiful, but also the connections with other characters. I loved Issac's story just as much as the main characters. I felt for these people without ever having gone through what they were going through. John Green brought them to life in a very real, poignant way.<br /><br />I think of all the years I've been on Amazon, I've written maybe 2 reviews. This would be the second. If you don't read this book, you are missing out.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Mary and Matthew! Finally.  Catch up before the new season is available in January. What will Anna endure this year?
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|I like this game except that many of the options are too difficult.  I like the variety of options though.
B00633W614|5.0|I've always enjoyed Jeffrey Archer a nd this series is no exception!  Read the first two books in record time and can't wait until March when the next book comes out!
B005CM9DX6|3.0|This is certainly not my favorite album.  Glad I could support the band with a purchase, hopefully it will help to fund a better album.
0807014273|5.0|It must be at least 25 years since I first read \\"Man's Search for Meaning,\\" and I still refer to it. Frankl spends about half the book describing his experiences in Nazi concentration camps, and the rest of the book discussing how he tried to make sense of it and teach others how to handle adversity. One of the most important books around, highly recommended.
B009EEFTMC|4.0|I have never played this game before and I found it rather cute.  It will be fun to play it somemore.
B0058YPGSY|5.0|Love buying SOA on DVD -- get to watch it marathon-style instead of one episode a week. Interesting characters, love Gemma!
B0063M22QO|4.0|I have always like the game of Mahjong, and this one is a very good.  Helps to pass time quickly and doesn't lose your interest.
B004ZN9RWK|5.0|again is the number one  this is one of the best album i am going to kip that for ever
B003ZFCBJ0|5.0|just over all good movie.  I would love now to read the book because I heard the book is even better than the movie.  You won't be disappointed with this movie.
B00000634J|2.0|the cd was not y good condition wen the CD arrive i put that in my radio and what a surprIse the music bump
B002BWP49C|5.0|I love the movie took me a very long time to find the movie for a very good prize to buy cant wait to buy the next new breaking dawn part 2 thanks for sending it on time
B0000669JL|5.0|hi is one of the best artist from my time like 20 years ago  i am so happy with this cd
B0043RSK3K|5.0|I AM NOT FINISHED READING THIS BOOK , I KEEP HAVING TO STEP AWAY FOR AWHILE TO ABSORB WHAT I'VE READ-- WHICH IS CONTRARY TO WHAT I'VE BEEN TAUGHT. WELL, PERHAPS NOT ALL &#34;CONTRARY&#34; BUT SOMEHOW A LOT OF HISTORY GOT LEFT OUT ALONG THE WAY. THIS BOOK SO FAR HAS ANSWERED A LOT OF MY QUESTIONS BUT GIVEN ME EVEN MORE. AN EYE OPENING READ, FOR SURE.
B007TXN4TK|5.0|My daughter loves to doodle with music.  There isn't anything she doesn't like about it.  I would recommend this to anyone with children who love music.
B000SEGUDE|2.0|Parts are alright but large sections were too difficult to read. Language did not flow well, lots of invented words, or old English used in parts. Was not impressed overall.
B0049J3QNG|5.0|The kid's will watch it over and over and over again,Trust me.They love them all,Toy story One Two  and three.
B0014VQGX4|2.0|Very dissappointed with this.  Thought it was good, strong quality like Tonka.  Wasn't even close.  Very overpriced.  Stick with Tonka
B00AE2J93I|4.0|The animation is great. The zombies were disgusting as they should be. Interesting but sad story about a terrible time in our nation's history.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|Great game! Problem solving and great graphics for a little app like this. Already recommended it to friends. Download, totally worth the $
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Purchased the Fire HD for my girlfriend for Christmas, mostly for her to use with Facebook. As luck would have it - the facebook app does not work and she's right back to checking it on her iphone. She's now completely uninterested in this tablet and I spent $200 on a dud. Big expectations - small return. Hard to believe that the developers would send out an app for the most popular social media website in the world that freezes, locks and does not display the news feed. NOT RECOMMENDED
B001U3Y5XE|4.0|I bought this for my nephews to play together.  It's hard to find games that all three of them are interested in with their age span.  This one did the trick!
B009IQ0TGM|3.0|I bought this mainly for the two songs I like.  I should have purchased them separately.  There are no major flaws in this work, my main complaint is a &#34;sameness&#34; that makes most of the songs sound exactly alike.  Pairing that with Ellie's high-pitch wailing (screeching) style and after 3 songs I just feel more annoyed than entertained.  Great for hard-core fans but from now on I'll pick and choose individual titles from Ms. Goulding.
0307352145|5.0|Susan Cain has the subject nailed in this book and it is worth reading for all, introverts and extroverts alike.
B009VLX8FS|5.0|I'm not normally a country music fan and I always considered her a &#34;country&#34; singer.  However this album has a little bit of everything in it, making it an enjoyable experience to listen to.  After listening to this album Taylor Swift ranks right up there with Pink and Katy Perry in my book.  Glad I purchased and I will enjoy this for a long time.
B00AMBK6J2|4.0|I watch a lot of Family Guy so renting this movie was a no brainer. I gave it four stars instead of five due to a few cheesy &#34;Naked Gun&#34; throwback scenes that were out of place.
B001AACEP8|5.0|Katy Perry never disappoints.  This album is full of silly fun, word play, pain and pathos - there is a song for every mood.  There is something here for everyone of any age.
B007M45PMU|5.0|I discovered this band after being invited to catch a G-Love show at the Fox Theater in Boulder, Co. The Lumineers opened for them and I instantly fell in love with them which is a first for me. Back then, it was still pretty easy to get tickets. Now, only a year later, it is nearly impossible! Good Luck Lumineers! Don't forget to come home once and a while!
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|this is one of the most awesome games I own!!!! my stickman is me! I drew pigtails &amp; a dress. my friend is not a person; its my orange cat!! pumpkin. I showed this game to my lil sis and she LOVED IT. she showed the game to buck, my lil bro, and he also loved it and downloaded it on his phone! his stickman is him, and his friend is a giant spider! !! lol that's a boy fer ya!<br />altogether, this game is awesome and you will have to buy the full version as free is not enough!!!! 5 stars! ;)
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|Excellent story could not put it down easy read and look into north korea problems and background was helpful as you went along
B002ZG999U|5.0|This is great all the action players together. You need to see this and I will get Expendables 2. GREAT
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|It is a blast while just killing a little time waiting on my doctor to call me in for my physcial.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|This IS the best movie we have ever watched. It is a true story how your dogs can grow attached to one person. LOVED this VERY much
B0053O89WY|5.0|The Big Bang Theory may the funniest show on TV today.  This is another stellar season. Looking forward to more.
B000KJT8IG|2.0|There are too many adult inuindos, vulgar language and nudity. This is not a family movie. Would not recommend this movie to anyone.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This is a really cool game. It fun and keeps me challenged. I recommend it to anyone who likes puzzle games.
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|Interesting read.  I appreciated how Preston/Child sent out the first few chapters prior to the book being released.  Wasnt the best Pendergast read.  A bit reminiscent of when Clive Cussler had a few kids show up for Dirk Pitt....and all those books went downhill from there...we shall see.
B007L6VR12|1.0|The TV previews of this made it look really interesting but it was really lame. Perhaps not really the WORST but it was right up there. Don't waste your money on this one!
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|I truly love Preston & Child's writings, both singular and together.  Without revealing far too much and spoiling your suspense and anticipation prior to reading, Two Graves brings an end to the &#34;Helen Trilogy,&#34; and also gives Agent Pendergast much to ponder regarding the future.  I wondered where this storyline was going, and figured The Gents would have to add something in the way of a new antagonist after Diogenes.  I eagerly devoured this book, and the whole truth that came out regarding Helen and her mysterious &#34;death&#34; and subsequent re-appearance in Pendergast's life simply amazed me.  If you've been following Pendergast's storyline, you owe it to yourself to follow through and read the whole Trilogy, starting with Fever Dream (2010), Cold Vengeance (2011), and now Two Graves.  If you love the stories of Agent Pendergast, you will not be sorry to read Two Graves.  Kudos to The Gents for bringing another well-earned triumph to the Best Seller List!  Bravo!
B005MYEQ4U|4.0|A movie well worth watching again. The music and the views of Paris make it one of our favorites and will be played a few times I'm sure.<br />The one problem we had with the DVD was that it was zoned incorrectly for Australia. We are zone 4' and this DVD is 3.. Something we wll have to watch out for when we order again!<br />Regards<br />Maureen
B004NDVJJG|5.0|Some reviewers feel that with January, the trio reached their ECM apex thus far. I disagree. While I'm a bit late getting to the party re this amazing trio, I have gobbled up all three albums and have ordered a couple of their earlier releases. I find a progression to their work, with each album giving evidence of the trios continuous growth.<br /><br />Yes it's true: I have fallen in love with this trio, and for me Faithful is the album I am most impressed with at the moment. It's the original compositions that have me in their thrall. Wasilewski's writing reminds me at times of Esbjorn Svensen, and that's a very high compliment. It's lyrical, moving and seriously deep stuff that is deceptively simple, yet there is a lot going on under the hood both harmonically and compositionally. \\"Night Train to You\\" is a fine example-written in 11/8, it glides along, well, like a train, pumping, visceral, powerful, relentless, yet at the same time poignant and wistful. Song for Swirek is another high point- a web of subletly shifting harmony underpins a simple singable melody. It really gets under one's skin and doesn't let go. The whole album is a well balanced mix of originals and jazz standards; there's not a dull moment, the \\"low point\\" (still gorgeous,) perhaps being a rather surprisingly conventional reading of \\"All the Sad Young Men.\\" Nothing wrong with it- I just expected Marcin to put a bit more of his unique harmonic stamp on it.<br /><br />I have been playing this album for weeks and still find a lot to discover and savor. What great interplay between these young players! What a polished and refined player Marcin Wasilewski is! To top it off, Manfred Eicher's pristine production makes makes this pure aural gold.
B0044XV3QY|5.0|for this price you get Everything minus the 3D, but this movie on blu ray is one of the top tier choices for a great movie!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Beautiful enlightening story...I have read many many books about NDE's but Eben Alexander's stands out mostly because it came from a scientist and an expert on the human brain. Science and spirituality have been moving closer and closer together through professionals like Dr. Memhet Oz and Dr. Alexander. This book is filled with scientific evidence that life after death does indeed exist and the importance of knowing this is to help us live a better more fullfilled and purposeful life now. It gives hope and courage to those of us struggling with life's adversities knowing the beauty of the after life he describes is waiting for us when our time here is through.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|I found this book very entertaining.  It took the Pendergast on quite an adventure and it allowed the reader to see new sides of the FBI agent.  It is full of action and challenges.  The book is actually presenting three stories simultaneously but they are woven together with ease.  The reader is curious to reach the outcome of each story.  Answers are provided to the reader for questions that stem from previous books so overall I found Two Graves to be most satisfying.  It was hard to put it down once I started to read it again.  Highly recommened!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|this app does everything it's supposed too and does what is expected. I am using the K.Fire and have not experienced any hiccups with this app :)
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Joss Whedon's vision for this sci-fi western is beautifully portrayed with the help of an amazing cast of actors. You will not be disappointed.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|This is really cool and is a great thing to have with you in case you need to whip it out and alarm people at your nerdy awesomeness!
B0094BB4TW|2.0|Half of the app doesn't even show up. It shows maybe the first 5 statuses then the rest of the page is grey. Also I do not recieve notifications on my kindle and the notifications are set to on.
B00AMBM9MO|1.0|Don't waste your time or money unless you're stoned and don't have anything better to do but fill your mind with garbage and bad ideas.
B00005N6KG|5.0|I type at home and these are great and easy to use and transport; very study, durable, and clear-sounding as expected from Sony.
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|It's Seth McFarlane.  It HAS to be good!  This film is intended for adult audiences.  It is hysterical!  The bear is believable.  Pure frackin Magic!
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|I got this app on my Kindle Fire for my son.  He enjoyed playing Angry Birds so much but was getting bored with it so I got this give him a different challenge.  I like the way you need to build a wagon proportionately or it will tip over, just as it would in real life.  I play Bad Piggies sometimes and it drives me nuts but I like the challenge.
B005CRQ2DK|4.0|In this book book Jeff Kinney did a great job expressing his juvenile mind to the great world of books.
1449410243|4.0|I got this book as a joke for my mom for Christmas and it was pretty funny, however I think the bob cats section was used as more of a filler and really wasn't all that funny
B00AMBM9MO|2.0|If it wasn't the voice of Seth mcfarland it would ve much better.. I can only think of peter griffin
B009DKFST6|3.0|Always like his music, but this CD not as good as the previous and some songs may be ...too raunchy.
B009S8PEHY|5.0|I was a little skeptical about Rod Stewart for Christmas music (I will always think of Maggie May) but this is a great album.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This was a great read. It was great to see two damaged souls find strength and love that helped heal them.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It's one of the best diary of a wimpy kid books there is out there I think you should read it.
B007SGM084|4.0|In book 1 I was able to foretell the love connection.  Book 2 was typical and I haven't mustered the interest to even finish book 3.  It is just too predictable.
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|They should have named this Batman Retires?  What is the deal with introducing Robin at this point?  I thought it was the last of the series???
B0083SBMBM|5.0|I've alway's loved super heroes but the Avengers are the coolest super hero teams I've ever seen, but as you know the the team isn't complete yet
B004FRX0MY|4.0|I find that this free app for storing your music online is one of the better ones out there. It allows you room for storing 250 songs for free, at first I thought that 250 wouldn't be enough, however, I was totaly rong. 250 is really quite abit of music. Thank you Amazon.com you come through for me once again. Marty
B0004Z33F0|5.0|I've always loved the Rambo triligy but this is the best one by far in the meaning of knowing what's right.
B000I0QM0E|4.0|A great twist to a classic American tale, all of the actors are not top notch, but it still is good.
B0004Z33EQ|4.0|I've always loved the Rambo triligy but this one is great by far and I hope other people can see that.
B007B17XW4|3.0|I orderd this product and received it as quoted. It was for Christmas, so I didn't take it completely out of the box until I was ready to wrap it for my son.  I opened the shipping box to make sure it was what I ordered then put it away.  When I went to wrap it, I realized the box was crushed open on one side.  It didn't compromise anything on the inside, it could have happened with the shipping, but the outter box was not broken.  Worked out fine as the legos were not harmed and we don't keep the box once my son builds it.
B006O6F932|5.0|My 10 year old LOVES IT..If your girl is into monster high she'll love it..its a little over priced for what you get BUT to see her open it was well worth it..
B009SQRL4U|4.0|James McAvoy was a great voice choice for Arthur, and the story was all right and even managed to skip a few cliches along the way.  This is the best new-ish Christmas movie I have seen in ages.  Parts are very funny as well, particularly GrandSanta!  &#34;At least finish us off with a rock!&#34;
B000QRIGLC|5.0|An amazing, true story.  The authors storytelling is gripping, making you feel like you are right there with Marcus and his team.
B005VPRET4|5.0|My almost-5-year-old wanted \\"girl Legos\\" for Christmas and this was a hit.  With little help she was able to construct the set using the provided instructions.  After that, the imagination kicked in and I foresee hours of fun ahead.
B005LAIH54|4.0|I was a fan of the original from when I was a little girl and this remake was enjoyable to watch. Sam Worthington does a good job.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|With the best actors yoy couldn't have a bad movie. Had to watch it twice and sent one to a friend and she's watched hers at least five times.
B005LAIHYU|5.0|I wasn't sure what to make of this movie until I saw it and just loved how badass they made the character. I loved it all the way.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|Slow and issues with moving from page to page. Search options are very slow and loading is even slower. If they can fix these issues it would be a good app
B004LWZW4M|5.0|I really enjoyed seeing this moving and how life like they made the apes. Great storyline too.<br /><br />I am so happy to own this as part of my collection
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Love this game. Easy to use and challenging. I play it for hours and hours of fun. Graphics are great too
B008JMKN4Y|2.0|Trying very hard not to loose my attention with this book. I will finish it but I am sure I will not remember it,
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is great the thing I bate about most games is they make you buy something but not this one!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :):):(:):)
B007IXWKUK|5.0|held my attention, Iam looking forward to the next one. Buy the book you will enjoy the book, i knowI did.
B0098XY5VK|3.0|great game but after the first round you have to buy it and I'm not allowed to buy games so I have to stop playing it
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Looking forward to the next crossfire book.<br />xx xx Ihate thesehaving tosaymore when I am done. Buy the book ,youwil love it.
B0066W1AZK|3.0|I have a kindle fire and downloaded this game. It is hard to beat but kind of fun I guess. Overall I'd give this a 3 and a half or maybe 4.
B00846REIS|5.0|held my attention, Iam looking forward to the next one. Buy the book you will enjoy the book, i knowI did.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|great User interface and play time. gets a little slow with load time. great for long boring days or road trips.
B006LSZECO|4.0|held my attention, Iam looking forward to the next one. Buy the book you will enjoy the book, i knowI did.
B0000931QR|3.0|The CD came just fine but the case had a hole in it and was very much cracked. Over all the product came good and turned out to be fine.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Great entertainment ... We watched the movie three times.  Funny, witty, enjoyed the a Capella sets...<br />Lots of music ... Enjoyable
B004YM6JLO|5.0|This is the best season so far. I just love the involvement that Klaus has in every storyline. I can't wait until Season 4.
B00A0SKFLG|3.0|Slow .. Preview made the movie more appealing than it actually was.  Was more like a wannabe move.. Some action...
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I can't believe that's how  he ended it! So ready for the next one! One of my favorite series!!! Amazing.
B006LSZECO|3.0|This book grabbed me and sucked me in, it was so good. Great build up right up to the disappointing ending. So I liked it but the ending sucked!!!!
B0070ZLZ1G|4.0|A great and refreshing look at how children (and adults) learn.  A fresh look at how we might want to educate our children.
B007THA4FI|3.0|It just didn't hold my interest. The book's premise was clever but I found it plodding, put it down and haven't finished it.
B001MSMUH0|4.0|The thinking of the past is that you do what the world views as valuable.  Money was common denominator.  Your were measured by this measuring stick.  Do not measure up, and the world thinks less of you.  This book hellps the reader look at the world with a new assumpton; what is your passion.  When you look at the world from this view, the work you do become more meaningful, it is less like work and more like play.  There are traps that must be avoided.  This is an excellent book for those that do or want to look at things from a differnet point of view.
B005CGI3ZG|5.0|love the set. huge fan. can't beat the price. but the way it is set up is ridiculous. seriously needs some work on the individual dvd packaging in the box.
B00846REIS|5.0|This was a grest book!!!! I yhink it was even better then 50 shades of grey!!!!!! I would Highly recommend
B003O86FMW|5.0|Easy reading.  After reading the first book, there was no doubt that I had to read the second one and I was not disappointed.
B009329ZF2|5.0|action ,action, action, and leaves you wanting a sequel, i hope there,s a part two, if not this one you,ll watch over and over
0792164903|5.0|These two men are a perfect pair when it comes to movies, and it gets even better when you add Christopher Walken and Christina Ricci. Great movie so much blood it's unbelievable so it's not scary just thrilling.
B004EPYZUS|5.0|as a long line of original series continues with the tom cruise  as the lead, you couldn,t ask for more action,waiting for the next one
B004UID2LC|4.0|This has all the youtube videos it's just perfect the layout just threw me off a little bit. If you watch a lot of youtube then get this.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|watch it over and over, i love a good funny cartoon, with lot,s of punch lines. wish there mmore like this
B009MCRHH6|3.0|It is a fun game to pass the time but after 10 levels or so its boring. If you like angry birds then get the game it's somewhat similar.
B009KHDT0C|5.0|a toss up of scary ,funny, sexy, event,s all come togather to save a family buiness,and get rid of a witch.
B0085P2Z6E|2.0|This game is okay. There are conversation bubbles to tell the story. If you don't tap- the bubbles won't go away. They flash and jump all over the place. I want to follow the story not just find objects. It is easy to miss dialogue and hints which disappear too fast when tapping the screen. If you want a smooth story progression and enjoyable dialogue- this is not the app for you.
B00APUYN0I|2.0|Acting was poor, music was peanut buttered and formless.  Tweeners would rave, my daughter suggested it....she is twenty-six and a high school teacher.
B0000TB01Y|4.0|I do not understand (and want you to disregard) those reviews written by people who have experienced only either this CD or the show. Please find reviews who have watched the show AND listened this CD.<br /><br />I bought this CD after I purchase the musical ticket but before watching the show. I kind of prepared for the show (and that is what I do to understand the show performance better). My first impression for the CD is not the greatest - it is like 3 stars out of 5. It sounds more like.... very well singing amateurs rather than professionals. Notes and voices are not too stable making you lose focus to the music.<br /><br />Then I saw the show - well played and well made, very creative story. Now I see why people give this musical as good reviews as the 4 major musicals. The casts actually sang better than the CD casts and I thought the CD can be better if re-recorded. Here this CD earned one more star from me, because of the show.<br /><br />Then I listened the CD again - it brouhgt all the scenes and memories from the musical. I can picture the scenes by each song.<br /><br />I personally think all the mucial sound track CDs are for those who wants to keep the memories from the show after wathcing the show. I don't think the intention was to replace whole musical with this one set of CD so that you do not have to watch the show. It is like you buy a Harry Potter movie scripts instead of the novel book then say &#34;this book is horrible&#34;.<br /><br />Conclusion: CD perfomance = 3 stars, CD with the memories from the show = 4 stars
B006KX3GXO|2.0|My sister downloaded this app and also experienced the perplexing upside down image on her Kindle Fide HD. It may not be the app at all though, but the camera on the Kindle. She actually deleted the PicsArt app and downloaded the Skype. Suddenly, voila, right side up image on the camera. Maybe if the Skype app is activated along with PicsArt, the image will also right itself. Good luck!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Really great book. I have read it many times. Nothing can keep you away from the rest of the series! The movie is also pretty close to the book
B000V6I7WG|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies.  I am really glad to see the tartan Asia extreme movies coming to blu-ray.  Some are great and some are terrible, but this is the best one.  I'm not going to review the movie here because I personally hate movie reviews, but i will say I recommend it.  Also look for the boxed set called the vengeance trilogy which contains this, plus 2 other movies from the same director.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|Installed this with 16 GB RAM, SSD, and a middle tier video card.  Registers 8.1 on the Windows Experience index. Thirty second boot time when the switch is pushed.  I can live with this for a while :).
B001NXBRJG|4.0|I like the movie, but i have to take a star off for the packaging.  I know its just a preference but i don't like blu-ray book packaging.  I ended up getting the matrix boxed set which is a better deal if you want all 3 movies,  Gave this one away to a friend.
B007UZO3F6|4.0|I did quite a bit of research on what kind of system to build. The result was to move away from a &#34;gigantic&#34; tower to this model with a very small footprint.<br /><br />Added an Intel I5, 16 GB Ram, SSD, Windows 8 and an MSI PCI-E video card that was listed as compatible on the Shuttle website. I had no issues with installation and have been up and running for a couple of weeks. It is fast and has a rating of 7.8 on the Windows Experience Index. It has a 500 Watt power supply which is more than adequate.  If you are used to building systems this unit is a snap.
B006PGL7OQ|5.0|I watched this movie based on recommendation from a friend without knowing anything about it.  If you think you might like it you probably will.  Just don't go ruining it by watching trailers and reading reviews.
B005HSL626|4.0|THIS GAME IS EASY TO PLAY AND IT KEEPS THE CHILDREN BUSY FOR A WHILE. MY 6 YEAR OLD REALLY LOVES THIS GAME.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This is the best way for me to stay organized with everything I see on the internet.<br />So unique<br />.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|Very fun and intrigueing! Great if you're a spider man fan or just bored. This is like a free-roaming kind of game. Great graphics and fun.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|More like 4.5 but thought it was a sexy enough story to rate ut as a 4. The couples relationship was cute and hot.. A little twist at the end was interesting.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I LOVED the Book so much it is Is like others. It is unique .<br />And nice,funny, cool, insane and amazing
B00632HWOG|5.0|Love this!  I had Yahoo Mail on my phone, but it loads much faster on my new Kindle Fire HD. And I don't have to get out my reading glasses!
B0076DELIG|5.0|Enjoyed following Harry Bosch through the case and his relationships.  An old friend and a complex mystery.  Great Read!  Look forward to Michael Connelly's next Bosch book.
B004DLPXAO|3.0|I downloaded this app on my phone.  I wanted a Kindle, but thought I'd try this first. The app is great, downloads are quick.  It does suck the life out of my battery, though.<br /><br />Great way to try the Kindle family before buying one.  Can't beat the awesomeness of a Kindle.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|At first I couldn't get into the book--didn't know or understand the background of the story, but I kept plugging along and could not put it down!  Interesting, scary future to think about.  I'm sure a movie will be made.
B005IZLPKQ|2.0|worked ok then after 4th watch it stopped working.. I have a brand new dvd player so this product was not in good shape
B0070Y46UY|4.0|Had a hard time getting into the book but it turned out interesting.  Now there is the movie version and I look forward to comparing it to the book to see how a movie can center around a boy and a bengal tiger!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|So this book was about a Valentine's dance and Greg the main character and Rowley who's suppose to be Greg wingman are trying g to both find dates. Greg ends up flinging not so much the perfect girl. But then in the end Rowley ends up with that girl and that's how Greg ends up being the third wheel.
B00AE2LJVS|2.0|I'm still trying to figure out the reason all of these actors signed up for this film. Beyond representing the point of view of a working-class kid trying to make a living as a bootlegger, nothing fresh or provocative about the Prohibition Period was explored here. And most of the characters were very one-dimensional (good, bad, naive, etc.).
B009MCRHH6|5.0|Loved the graphics. Sometimes a bit difficult to choose individual goo balls, but otherwise an awesome game! I had it on my computer but now having it on my kindle makes playing it again fun!
B004EPYZUI|5.0|Love the cinematography in this movie.  The story line can be hard to keep up with (according to some of my friends) - but I personally didn't have a problem with it.  Really love the gritty nature.  :)
B00AHSLU2C|5.0|a great movie for the whole family,awesome color in HD and very cute<br />we bought our self a new flat screen TV for x-mas and finding nemo was our first movie
B0095R6OBS|4.0|Even though the characters are not as wonderfully bizarre as they are in the feature film this 30 minute feature tote is well worth having and re watching. The story of a boy and his dog and their love and devotion to each other still shines through.
B00A3CVFMM|5.0|Love the hobbit!!! i bought the soundtrack before watching the movie and all the songs made me want to watch the movie even more!!! I have seen it three times and can't wait to go again!!!
B0009P5YXO|5.0|This is an exact replica of the 10th Doctor's Sonic, it looks and sounds just like it, and can be sonic'ed in both the up and down position (albeit by different buttons).  I have nothing bad to say about this, and I love this thing, much better than the 11th Doctors Sonic.
B0070ZLZ1G|5.0|Meaty and full of research to back the author's conjecture. The issue is complex and therefore readers should not expect simple universal solutions. This book uses case studies to personalize and bring research to light. The struggles related to achievement gaps are analyzed in depth. The book advocates for building resiliency skills in students using a menu of options to do so. One size does not fit all.
B009MCRHH6|1.0|the requirement to log into my Amazon account every time I want to play it is a pain. So I uninstalled it.
B007MC8YLQ|2.0|I thought the game would be bigger on the screen. It is small and hard to play and see. You can't just tap the card you must drag it to the spot you want it at.
0439882826|5.0|Amazing how this book comes to life in so many different places.  Order it and watch it come to life!  Fantastic Purchase!
B005PWPUW6|5.0|This device hooked up easily, and was making the sound on my computer even more rich. This is a great device to bridge your out put of sound. Great product.
B0091REZMW|3.0|Fun but being uninstalled. I hit a wall when it wanted me to download more content. I wanted to but could not get to the download button on my galaxy skyrocket. The button was hidden off screen and there was no where else toaccess the setting.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|It's a story you won't regret. It makes you want to know everything, you just live the story. It's just a beautiful story.
1419705849|5.0|My granddaughter was thrilled when I let her open one gift Christmas eve and she discovered that I had purchased the latest Wimpy Kid book. I was thrilled when she told me on Christmas morning that she had already finished the book. I like any book that can generate that kind of enthusiasm for reading.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This app is helpful when planning out of town trips especially in winter, it's easy to use and I would recommend it.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|These were purchased as gifts for replacement of VHS copies and for a person that had never seen it (can you believe it)!!!  We love this movie and watch it over and over during the Christmas season.  As a matter of fact my wife and I swear that our Christmas this year mirrored Griswolds.  We cut down our tree from the same location that we have for the last few years and for some reason the week before Christmas you could not even breathe on it without it loosing needles, so we had to go out and get a new tree, the hooter/hotter happened and we both just started laughing, the list could go on and on but at least we enjoyed our Christmas together watching this movie about 7 different times.  Love it!
0547884591|3.0|This book is not exactly what I thought it would be.  It is informative but not exactly what I was looking for.
B008YWY0HK|4.0|I am an avid animated movie buff.  This movie is pure rich color blended with great animation and story.  The bears are terrific and the red heads hair?  Awsome.  It's a Story with magic and a few laughs and a good heroine.  Check it out.
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|This was a really good and funny movie until the end.  The last 20 minutes were really stupid but I am glad I watched it.
B000VDDDVO|4.0|This is the sappiest of all Christmas movies and is not to be missed.  Every one should see this movie if not for the lesson that underlies the story, then for the story itself.  The good guys, the bad guy, the beautiful girl, the naughty girl, and an angel.  How can you pass this up?  Just plain makes you feel good, and all good people should see it.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|one of the best albums i have in my collection. i love her! can't wait for her next album to come out!
B0083SBMBM|4.0|I'm a Marvel junkie and I've seen 'em all.  This is the biggest kick yet.  If you don't know the Marvel world, you need to check out all of the movies that led to this one.  (There are many)  If you jump right into this you will enjoy it, but you won't know where all this came from.  The CGI is good and  comes in at the right time and doesn't dominate every frame .  The actors are all top notch and do their job with relish.  The death of the aliens at the end is a bit lame, but makes sense or the movie would have lasted for another  hours.  Lots of action, laughs and great faces.
B008CLI3TE|5.0|The five star rating is for the quality of the show - not the set itself. This is due to a couple of issues I had with the design of the box set. The DVD release of season 1 had five discs, so I was surprised that the blu-ray release had the same number of discs seeing as blu-ray holds considerably more information. Each disc only has two episodes on it. So despite my mild annoyance at having to change each disc after only two episodes, this is hardly a dealbreaker. The quality of the show in high definition makes this purchase well worth it. The set also includes several Easter eggs, or as the makers of the set are calling them - dragon eggs. Unlocking them will open extra features which should satisfy hardcore fans who will take the time to look. Each disc includes special features but it does not say which special features are on which disc. The features are listed within the booklet. However, the booklet doesn't state the location of the feature either. This seems a bit of an oversight on HBOs part and makes accessing special features a little less user friendly.
B003CSV7TK|4.0|This is a feel good movie and a Christmas favorite every year.  Even the anti-sapmaster, my old man, loves this movie.  Nat is terrific and &#34;cute&#34; and O'Hara is beautiful.  It just plain makes you feel like Christmas.
B00993FEUK|5.0|This 5 star review is aimed at the quality of the product purchased. However, the movie itself also deserves 5 stars as a fantastic family movie that is enormously entertaining.<br /><br />Not all combo packs are created equal. Some offer only blu-ray and DVD. Some also offer a 3D copy. Many will have a digital or Ultraviolet copy included. Not many offer Blu-ray, DVD, Digital Copy and Ultraviolet which is what makes this combo pack so great. To purchase each of these individually would be $10-20 each, so the $19.99 price tag is a steal. The digital copy will allow me to add the movie to my iTunes collection, while the UltraViolet copy I can stream through my blu-ray player or Roku wireless receiver. The quality of the discs themselves is excellent and they are well packaged. So basically this combo pack allows me the opportunity to view this movie in a variety of formats and from many different sources.
B003YHSE7W|3.0|Decent movie to own for the purchasing price. More of an addition to a blue ray collection. Not a movie you are going to watch 50 times during the time of ownership.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Angry Birds is a great game for (almost) all ages. It's fun and keeps you way up on your toes!
B005LAIHSQ|4.0|Good addition to a blue ray collection. Original renovation to a timeless classic. Not a movie you are going to watch 50 times.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|Very well done. High quality app. Could use a little more in the way of instructions, but very intuitive all the same.
B007HO392S|5.0|i love this cd. all the songs are great.usually there are only 2 songs, on the entire album fit to listen to, but this one is great.
B008MM9630|5.0|nice way to spend a snowy day cuddled on the couch.  no problems with the app.  don't have to buy extra things.
1423140605|5.0|I bought this book as a gift for my son.  He did not read it yet but is very happy to get it.
B007TXN4TK|1.0|Didnt work and slowed my phone down and things didnt work well until I uninstalled it from my phone. ugh.
B007SGM084|5.0|I read Fifty Shades of Grey, Then Fifty Shades Darker, Then Fifty Shades Freed. Afer placing the third book down, I picked up the first one and started all over again.  NEVER have I enjoyed a book this much.  It was not so much the kinky sex but rather the story line and the characters and how the author managed to keep the book exciting.  How a good man was being lead into the light by a good woman.  I already imagine, in a fourth book, how they have two more kids and Christian can be a completely healed, happy and confident person.  Of course, E.L. has left the door open:  Jack IS still alive, Leila IS still love-lost Leila, Eleana, yuck on her, IS still in Seatlle. As for a movie, I should suppose it would have to be X rated with all of the carrying on.  All in all..Loved the book.
B008CPZNL6|5.0|LOVE that I can access all my social media and news media in one easy to manage place. Plenty of room for all your must have news sources.
B0076DELIG|5.0|When you follow a character like Harry Bosch, he becomes a close friend, a friend that draws you into his life and adventures and you just cannot wait until the next adventure begins.  All of which tells us how much we love Michael Connelly and his talent as a great mystery writer is without question.  Just slow down the aging process for Harry because we are not ready for him to retire.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Okay, so you all will know from reading these reviews that this book is thrilling but may be a let down ending for many.  I happened to read it because it was what my book club selected last month.  To be honest, I felt the beginning was a bit slow but the other ladies in my club said \\"Oh, it'll get interesting...just keep reading\\".  Well it all picked up for me when Nick got the text message  which I won't reveal.  Yes, it got very interesting from there and I almost wanted to go directly the the end just to find out what happened!  Luckily I stuck to reading each page until the end.  As many  have already stated, you may be disappointed with the ending but to be honest, my brain just said \\"Oh my gawd!\\"  Sure a lot of it is a bit far-fetched but hey, this is a novel and not real life, so I can accept that.  No I didn't like any of the characters and yeah they swear way too much, but that shows their personality and give a certain feel to the book.<br /><br />This has gotten me interested in reading her other books!
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Clancy always tells a good story with great characters.  As usual, you have to follow the complicated flow of the plot line but it's always worth it to see it all come together.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|This is a really good logic game to play, if your the type of person that loves a thinking game.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I like playing this game to pass the time, it is a brain teased but not too hard. I play on the Kindle Fire.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Quick game but one that is a lot of fun to play.  Enjoyed it very much.  Is an easy game to play but still needs concentration to win.  Like it very much.
B001HN69B8|5.0|My daughter really wanted this movie but I could never find it in the stores.  Glad I was able to finally find it for her.
0525952926|5.0|Very well written, even better than the first of the trilogy. Thouroghly enjoyed the perspective of each of the families and how they are entertwined.
B003L16FAE|1.0|What can one say .I Time to go through the  the hassle of returning it, and hope he next one works or is it just easier to get another disk. Like a used one at least I'd feel better about it being operational.
B004LROMQG|5.0|This was on sister wish list for Christmas list. her and hubby is so into this TV show they love it.
B0050Q3TDY|5.0|Ever since I downloaded this app I LOVE IT!!! It has different types of jazz that I love to listen to. Everything from John Coltrane to Boney James. I can listen to it on my kindle while surfing the web. Now I don't listen to any other internet station but this one.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app is great for developing a daily reading plan or if you just want to read on your own...
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Great movie, Gordon Levitt was great. Great action, amazing ending. This is truly a cannot miss movie. Almost as good as the first
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Not as easy as you might think, gets more difficult as you progress.  I have a few, that I have not been able to resolve, but I keep going back to work on them.  Love this little game.
B00A757EFW|4.0|The game is great as you find in a arcade room (if those still exists). But the sound needs to enhance to we all remember.
B005PK58TI|5.0|I just watched this entire season and though I NEVER watch TV programs and do not subscribe to TV, this was absolutely an experience that I will forever enjoy and changed my mind about considering TV altogether.  This was the most unique and well put together series that could have ever been imagined.  It sets a NEW standard in the Horror genre and I hope the the the Dreck that comes out of hollywood will follow suite.  After watching this entire show, it makes even the most successful blockbuster movies seem \\"cheap\\" and tiresome.  American Horror and it's superb cast will certainly be hard for any to measure up to.  Jessica Lange just made and owned the entire series for me.  Her unique acting, voice and sensual yet dark presence was what I believe made this the success it was.  I have just started season 2 but I think season one will always be the most successful.  As I said, TV and it's commercialized and mind numbing shows long ago turned me away from ever subscribing to TV again.  I just found this on Amazon and I was hooked.  Brillant writing, producing and Acting will make this show that I hope will redefine the standards.  Of course it's not without it's share of consistancy flaws but they are more tolerable as found myself just wanting to enjoy the program without looking for them.
B000YHG72E|3.0|My wife has never seen this movie and rented it. I don't think that will happen again, I tried to warn her that it was an ok movie that will probably be on regular tv 50 times this season. But convenience won out.
B004ZRV3AU|4.0|This bottle cutter works good, but it takes a little while to master the art of cutting.  Try different methods than those included in the directions because those did not work for me.  Overall i am happy!
B0055B7IPE|5.0|Amazing, endearing and engrossing story. Beautifully rendered with a lot of detail for physics and texture.<br />The dogs are hilarious!
B0094BB4TW|1.0|The timeline only shows half of the updates, the rest are unable to be read. Awful app, going to delete it to use the Silk version.
0307719219|4.0|This book is very rich in information specially about important turnover points over the history, such as Industrial Revolution and French Revolution. Even though is few repetitive in some parts, the book has a robust theory about the reasons that justify why some nations prosper and some others fail. It´s a intersting reading and very powerful in terms of arguments and informations.<br />Very Good. 4 stars.
B005LAII1C|2.0|The movie itself is slightly entertaining. Some parts are &#34;OK&#34; but more than anything the shock factor is what makes you laugh. I would never consider letting my children watch this.
B003EYVXXW|4.0|Set in the 4th century A.D. in Alexandria, \\"Agora\\" follows the fall of the Pagans as the newly empowered<br />and growing Christian movement took over. On a political and historical level the film works well, with interesting<br />swipes at the destructive power of religious fanaticism (Pagans, Jews and Christians all have some very bad<br />moments here), and obvious parallels to today, when extremists of various faiths can still be seen<br />to be taking making some of the same kind of violent attacks on those they see as wrong or other, as well as<br />dis-empowering women, denying science and distorting scriptures to justify violence or oppression.<br /><br />On a human level the film is a bit more rocky. The story centers on Hypatia, a female teacher, philosopher and<br />scientist who, at least at the start of the film, is given the same level of respect as a great male thinker - something<br />that seems very rare in the world of the film. She is outspoken in preaching brotherhood, and always unbowed in her<br />pursuit of knowledge.<br /><br />Rachel Weisz does good work in the role, but I wish the film hadn't made her so glamorous in look and feel, which<br />seems like a movie conceit, a bit at odds with the character. More important, the movie feels slowed and weighed<br />down by the stories of the various men trying to romance Hypatia, in spite of her seeming indifference to romantic<br />entanglements and her almost monk like devotion to knowledge. It's not that these sub- plots are bad, they're just<br />much less interesting and more pro forma than the far less familiar historical, scientific and social material and story<br />lines that surround them.<br /><br />Amenebar is without question one of our most talented directors, so when he makes a film that doesn't reach the heights<br />of \\"The Sea Inside\\" or \\"The Others\\" or \\"Open Your Eyes\\" it can't help but feel a little disappointing. But that doesn't mean<br />it's not worth seeing.  His slight misfire here still beats most of what's out there handily.sfire here still beats most of what's out there handily.

B005NJU8PA|5.0|If you've read any of his other books, then this is easy. It's written with the same simple language that's made his franchise so successful. This book is a combo cookbook meets in-depth explanation about 'meta learning' (filtering through mass amounts of material to absorb only what's necessary for subject comprehension & implementation). For me, it was no question to pre-order this book before it was released. And it delivered!
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I'm not much of a gamer, but i found this game very easy  to play. I really love to play when i'm home from work and jus relaxing. It really calms my nerves.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This reminds me of the computer version. I have enjoyed playing it. I like the different settings that let me make it easier for my kids to play.
B00881VLCE|5.0|this game made it so easy for Me to get back into puzzles and stay mobile. they had so  many different picture types too.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I was engrossed with the first two. This one wasn't the way I'd hope it would end. Happy enough an ending for a story centered around the death of children.
B000062V9C|1.0|Didn't realize after spending 30 bucks that.I can't even watch this movie .I'm region 1 as I never knew i5 even matter.to return was a big hassle.I didn't even bother.love the movie ,but not this one...
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is so cool because you can use your habilities to past the nivels and run but can use your fingers to play
0300169787|5.0|This is a book to be cherished. It was on my coffee table until the cover started to get cracked. something to check whenever you are looking for inspiration.
B002UBRFDC|5.0|One of the greatest adventures of all time, based on the true story of William Adams and enlivened with compelling portraits of medieval Japanese culture in the era of the samurai...not to be missed
B004FN1T3A|5.0|I used this rating because this book is very informative.. Excellent info, I would recommend it to anyone having a baby
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Though it jumped in faster than k thought it would, it was a great book. The only thing I disliked was that she almost lacked a mind of her own, and gave in more easily than I'd of liked.
0062215507|5.0|This book is a must-have for any avid Harry Potter fan who loved the movie versions.  It has a fabulous layout with lots of behind-the-scenes photos, descriptions of the major characters and design elements of the film, and removable replicas of props and memorabilia.
B008O69SZ0|5.0|Short and to the point; I think this is Ian Hunter's best post Mott solo album ever and I own all of them. Amazing, the guy is 73 years old, his voice is still quite strong and his songwriting is better than ever.
B005LLSZNM|5.0|This season has been nothing but action, cliff hangers, and shocking surprises. This is the first season where I have been on the edge of my seat episode after episode. If you weren't a fan yet this will change your mind.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Like it a lot.. .much like Temple Run but better... Playing it all the time. .reviewed by my 8 year old son.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|My finance loves music and really wanted to watch this movie, i was a little hesitant. but after we did i was glad. really funny yet has a good story.
B0076DELIG|4.0|Harry Bosch is a character with many virtues and following his exploits has always been a worthwhile read.  And Connelly does not let you down with this latest adventure.
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|Heard from everyone that this movie was great, only to find out for myself that half-way through I wanted to turn it off... c'mon Marky-Mark.. your better than this..
B0076DCT2G|4.0|John Corey and Kate go to Yemen and the wit and wisdom of Nelson DeMille are reenergized with this story. Also there is a recap of what happened with the USS Cole.  Paul Brenner, who last appeared in &#34;Upcountry&#34;, also is nice addition to the story.
B001USHRCK|5.0|A Very cute village with lots of different aspects. Can't beat for building a child's imagination and all day play!
B007GCY8FS|4.0|I liked &#34;The Affair&#34; a little better, but you won't be disappointed with this latest Reacher adventure.  This has a bit of a Hollywood type ending, but there are still surprises along the way. No one is better than Lee Child at putting you in the middle of the action and all you have to do is hang on if you can.
B005LAIIQC|5.0|It's a Bourne movie. On BluRay. Cheaper than in stores. What is not to like?<br />Great movie! Great price! blah
1455844195|5.0|beautifully written sensitive story dealing both with bullying and friendship. hearing my grandsons remarks show me the importance of this book.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Everome views this as good as 50 Shades.  Well I am here to tell you that it is BETTER than 50 Shades. Oh do not get me wrong I LOVED 50' but Eva and Gideon is one of the best love stories that I have ever read. I cannot wait until # 3 comes out!!!! BRAVO Sylvia Day!!!!!
B00571F26Y|5.0|I kept hearing so much about the new &#34;fad&#34; gluten free. I needed to know more and a friend on facebook recommended this guys book (Dr. William Davis). Some of the chapters did not apply to the information I was seeking but none the less I learned more than I could have wished for. When I retell bits and pieces of this book to my friends they listen attentively and yearn to know more. This book just directly applies to the life of every American today. I recommend this for health and longevity.
B003G4W49C|5.0|excellent.  the way you think is incredible.  bean would disapprove of the flattery as do stoics but this is the kind of read that will keep replaying itself in ones mind for years to come.  you are da man.....der i go agin
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I really enjoyed this read. There was much controversy surrounding this book when I made the purchase. After beginning the read all of that stuff went right out the window. I read every chance I got and finished up quickly. Give it a shot, it wont disappoint.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Very quick and clear! Much better than with the computer. I quickly beat my previous  high score! Now if only I could beat the 4 suit! Argh!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I have two little girls and they thoroughly enjoyed this one....can't get enough.. love to compete to see who gets the most coins.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|One of my absolute favorite books. The action never stops, I never wanted to put it down for even a second!
B00A757EFW|5.0|Its like old day.... Nice graphics....much better then buy a arari flash back. Is better to get thi app. The lite version is free and the complete like  $2 dollard
B009YP9L7U|5.0|For a free book, good read.  Romantic from beginning to end. Loved how Connor finally wakes up to love. Awesome.
B005RJ6AIK|5.0|Loved this when I saw it on cable TV so had to get a copy to see whenever I wanted.  This is such a special story about a family going through an extremely difficult time and adding more and more to the mix.  Great story and fabulous acting.
B00AA7O22U|4.0|I have no expectations for the Expendables series since it is mostly a chance to rehash old cliches and see the heroes I grew to love as a kid. I mean Chuck Norris the one man army! great! The quality was pretty good, but don't go in thinking the plot and the dialogue as predictable. Just take it as pure action packed fun!
B008L1DNGI|2.0|I found it moderately dumb, with all the cats and mice running around and you have to retry the level if you die and it just gets annoying. really annoying.
0785163174|5.0|Once again my son wanted a comic book without the full store price. Got for him from Amazon at a great price.
B009ZXT4BY|3.0|I think I would of liked the game more if the controls werewolf bit better. pretty much like minecraft but just a lot more boring.
B008XG1X18|5.0|So much to see and so little time!  A treasure trove of good and fun ideas.  I am glad to not be required to do Facebook or Twitter.
B007VYDFMS|5.0|I found this documentary entertaining and informative on the life and times of Bob Marley. Held my attention from start to finish.  He really lived and loved a lot in those short 36 years.
B00A757EFW|4.0|The game was a little confusing at first, but the game is a classic! I love playing this game whenever I have done downtime :)
B009LDXQGC|5.0|I have recently seen them in concert in Belton,TX., it's nice to understand the words of the songs, the music is soothing to me.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I rated this 4 because I could, I like the game and played it all afternoon. at least till my battery ran out. very adictive.
B004SRPXWQ|3.0|It's cute, I am sure kids love it but for an older person the novalty wears off.  Great graphics though!
B008WCP2KG|5.0|Ok, soooo the storyline and acting in this movie was not Oscar-worthy!  Who stinkin cares!  It is entertaining at least and my love for Channing Tatum and the other attractive gentlemen in the film makes this completely worthy of the 5 stars.  Men are easily entertained and &#34;excited&#34; with movies that are filled with hot half-naked girls that have zero entertainment factor, horrible acting or are even remotely good to watch.  Us women on the other hand get the short end of that stick, not that it probably bothers us much.  Here is a movie that gives us what WE want!  These guys have swagger, amazing dance moves and they are definitely easy on the eyes.  It is also very funny and overall worth your time to watch.  Now, is that any different from all the guys that went to see Halle Berry's boobs in Swordfish or any other action/horror flick?  This movie received bad ratings probably for very stupid reasons....either you had way too high of expectations or your masculenity was threatened?  Don't let that discourage you from seeing and/or buying this movie!
B005I6EU48|5.0|The cover fits perfectly and looks great! For those that say the cover doesn't close, I think it just needs a few days to loosen up. After two days, the cover closes, and looks good too.
B001EBWIV8|5.0|Nice to have immediately and now on the cloud for life.  Only didn't like the lack of screen size options.
B009S8PEHY|5.0|This is a great album. I love Rod and he does a great job as usual. Keep it up Rod.

0345528581|4.0|Mark Lauren's credentials are great and his programs look effective and adaptable to a variety of athletes.  As a CrossFitter, I recognize a lot of common ground here.<br /><br />I'd recommend this book for anyone who wants to get fit but feels disinclined to join a gym.
B004J64QSI|5.0|wife and girls love it.<br />i think silly to need so many words for a review):<br />n o w done
B000BJS4SU|5.0|What can I say?  I'm not music scholar; just know what I like.  Mayer rocks.  It's real rock/blues, not fluffy pop.  Get some.
B001EC3JME|5.0|Fits good and tight for my Black CREE LED Rechargeable Flashlight (purchased from Amazon also).<br />You could rotate the holster so its good if you don't have a spare hand to use.<br />Tough material made to last long!
0316017930|5.0|I'm always up for Malcolm Gladwell's work.  He takes complex global concepts and distills them down into useful ideas to enhance our day-to-day lives.<br /><br />The primary take-away from &#34;Outliers,&#34; for me, is that &#34;genius&#34; isn't just a product of nature; nurture counts more than we knew.  Without a fertile environment for children, both gifted and average, to grow in we risk wasting the potential not just of the prodigies among us but all children.  Even a matter as simple as the birthdates of junior hockey players stacks the deck in favor of the older kids who enter the program six months earlier.  Gleaned from mundane statistics, this simple observation presents a solution that would give all kids an equal chance instead of just those with a random birth date advantage.<br /><br />There's lots more here from a wide range of topics, all fascinating.  I highly recommend &#34;Outliers.&#34;  I'm on to &#34;Blink.&#34;
B00632HWOG|4.0|I am able to get all my emails on the fly quickly!  It is great to be able to stay connected.
030746363X|5.0|I like Tim Ferriss' style.  He's found a way to get paid for investigating his obsessions.  The result is a micro-detailed, meticulously documented manual for achieving a variety of goals of common interest to most of us.  From losing or gaining weight to enhancing athletic performance to holding your breath under water, there is something here for everyone.<br /><br />The best part is that Ferriss' feats are demonstrable, documented and repeatable.  If you really, really want to gain 28 pounds and dead lift 500 lbs., you can do it.  The flip side, or course, is in his extreme methods.  Those attempting to follow in his footsteps should take note he had the luxury of time and resources to devote himself single-mindedly to each extreme pursuit.  You can do it too, but not without the same focused effort.<br /><br />For most of us, I think a sprinkling of Ferriss' methods alongside what we're already doing will be the most practical use of this handbook of the extreme.  I'm trying out a program used by a track coach to strengthen his athletes, but out of necessity can't devote myself exclusively to it.  As a CrossFit athlete, I've got too many modalities to cover to hyper-specialize in just one.  Hence I'll experiment on myself as Ferriss has, and see how it goes.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book.  There are few writers with as much skin in the game as Ferriss.  There's something useful here for just about everyone.

B005S9EK5Y|5.0|This movie was a solid performance. While being true to it's original version, this musical has once again taken my breath away. This movie was performed in a fantastic manner with a stunning set and a cast beyond recognition. I find myself getting chills every time I hear a bit from a song. My emotion overcomes me and takes me back to the very moment I was watching this amazing portrayal of the story for the first time. When the film ended, I knew I had to see it again. This film is very overwhelming in a very good way. The live singing was absolutely incredible and made an honest portrayal of the characters more personal and seemed to give the actors more freedom to do what they are so obviously great at. Words cannot describe how I feel about this film. I give it 5 stars in every category from the process of casting to the costuming and to the filming of every last scene. I cried several times throughout the night and my emotions are all mixed up inside, but there is something about the music and story that truly resonates with me. While seeing something live is always an amazing feeling, there is something that can be done with film that can't be done on a stage. If someone wants a true look into Les Miserables, this movie is the way to go. Job well done!
B008YRVW0I|5.0|I have it on my laptop and now can enjoy it on my Kindle for when Itravel!  Have fun with it!
B009JZVT70|5.0|My daughter missed Season 2 while away at Army Basic Combat Training.  She sat and watched the entire thing over her Christmas Leave from training.  The Second Season starts a little slow, but gets better & better as it goes on.
B0063IH60K|3.0|The game works fine but the agravating thing is the ad tht pops up between each game. The game would be 5 stars if we did not have to endure the ads.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|Bought this for my husband for Christmas.  He is a comic book geek, and loved the movie.  If you have a comic book fan in the round, this is the movie for them.
1449410243|5.0|I love these books, and this one was a great follow up to the last. Lots of new stuff and, of course, a poster. A coffee table fixture, everyone picks it up, and everyone laughs.
B009JBZH54|5.0|My son was begging for this collection for Christmas.  I shopped at the local department stores, and found this at a better price.  I have been told the extras are great!
B0081L391C|4.0|They didn't try to remake the show, they used it as a base to create a hilarious, sophomoric look at under cover cops. Don't go in expecting your usual buddy cop, comedy action either. This is pure douchebaggery in comedic form. Worth a watch.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|I didn't know what to expect from this CD.  I was pleasantly surprised.  I liked all the renditions and the mix.  I would highly recommend this CD.
B008FRFN7A|2.0|Still haven 't figured out how to use it. It's not intuitive and has lousy documentation. Spent over two hours trying to figure out how to print a web page and never did get it to work. I have printers on my wireless network, but it doesn't see them. Keeps talking about an e-print button on the printer but my HP printer doesn't have that button. No doco on what to do otherwise. Don 't waste your time
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|This is one CD that I like all the songs.  Phillip Phillips did a good job on the variety of songs.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Adele, Adele, man she sound's good, she has it all, soul, rock, pop, etc. Buy this CD and you will see what I'm talking about.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Always like to have a Solitaire game handy so that I don't get bored.  This version is easy to play and has a variety of deals.
B000005HDT|5.0|Donald Byrd - Blackbyrd<br /><br />  Although he has a ton of albums that I adore, Donald Byrd's masterpiece I think was Blackbyrd!  Surprisingly this album did not follow in the footsteps of \\"KOFI\\" which was more representative of Miles Davis stuff like \\"Bitches Brew\\" and \\"On The Corner\\".<br /><br />  In sharp contrast Byrd broke out the R&B grooves teaming up with Fonce Mizell to record this groundbreaking album making this the best selling Blue Note album of its time!<br /><br />  For Donald Byrd this album set him on his way and he would go on to make a few more groovy funk jazz album that would build on this work.  Stylistically this album is a mix of R&B, Funk, 70's pop and jazz elements all swirled together into a cohesive album that a true toe tapper.  The end result was a danceable album that was lighter and easier to listen to than many of his contemporaries.  In many ways this is almost a pre-cursor to the Disco era! ....almost.<br /><br />  Oh yeah and there is some vocals on this recording but used mostly as a sound vs the whole lyrics thing...which I think gives it that 70's feel to the the album.<br /><br />  Byrd handed over all the song writing to Mizell and he just stuck to helping bring out the true nature of these songs.  Byrd is assisted musically by some pretty good musicians including Roger Glenn (flutes), Joe Sample (keys), Fref Perren (keys), Dean Parks (guitar), Wilton Felder (bass), Harvey mason (drums), Bobye Porter Hall (Percussion) and Larry Mizell (vocals).<br /><br />  Fans of FUNK will love this album very much with songs like \\"Slop Jar Blues\\" and \\"Flight TIme\\" with its groovy bass lines.
B0007Y4TVU|3.0|Ok. This is the second one I have listed too and I really dont like it much. The music is very different then what i am used too.
B00962UJ22|5.0|&Auml;nglagård  - Viljans Oga (2012)<br /><br /> &Auml;nglagård are back !  and what a great \\"return \\" album.  For those like me that fell in love with this Swedish prog band and their stunning two studio albums - Hybris and Epilog will love Viljans Oga !<br /><br />  The entire band are back too with Mattias Olsson (drums),  Thomas Johnson ( pianos and mellotrons), Jonas Engdegård (guitars) and Anna Holmgren (flute and sax) and Johan Brand (bass).<br /><br />  I had the inside scoop that Anglagard were reforming and just could not wait to hear this album.  Vijans Oga picks up right where Epilog left off with huge swooping ever-tempo changing passages, heavy mellotron laden bits, great drumming, gut moving bass lines and wonderful flute interludes.<br /><br />  Anglagard are amongst my personal favourite prog bands of all time and although very different than Genesis, King Crimson, YES and Pink Floyd they exude a deep harmonic musical sensitivity that I just can not get enough of.  If you have not Anglagard then YOU NEED to get their albums........they are all fantastic too.......all of them!<br /><br />  In a very typical Anglagard style this album has only a few songs....in fact there are only four tracks that make up Viljans Oga....Ur Vilande, Sorgmantel, Snårdom and  L&auml;ngtans Klocka.<br /><br />  Definitely my favourite album of 2012 !  a clear winner !
B000ZINGIK|5.0|avantasia is a new cd that i have only listened to myself a few times. this is on the top 10 list.
B0035FZLSS|4.0|With so much to read to support the professional pressures we all are committed to, it is such a mini-vacation to take a trip through the classics!  This read provided exactly the amount of distraction to \\"take me away\\" just far enough to regain perspective on more pressing matters which dominate my time.  I recommend the trip!

B009MCRHH6|4.0|Fun game but gets a little more frustrating trying to play it well on a phone compared to a computer.  But still fun none the less just not superior to the computer experience.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|Although the app does connect to the users facebook, the features are not as good as going onto a PC.
B007HC3LHS|4.0|Better than I expected, good read, kept my interest, first book read by this author, good story line, would read more by her
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I had a similar expirience and I love how he explained it, I never find words to express what I felt in that moment, was peace, love and I do not have enough words por that.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Fun game, especially if you are like me and dump way too much money into this actual game at the arcade!
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|I really enjoyed enjoyed this book. As others noted it did start off a little slow, but that was necessary to really build the characters and ultimately the story. Even at it's slowest it was never boring. And once I hit the halfway point I couldn't put it down. Read the whole thing in one day and although I predicted the ending about 75% through, I still couldn't take break through the final 25%. Definitely worth your while.
B006BGZJJ4|4.0|Works well not quite ss well as the original black one however s ometimes I gave yo press s little to get the charge working
B003ODIZL6|1.0|It was very informative but you need to make it interesting so,that it will appeal to the younger crowd. Good
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|Language over the top....Howard Stren shiock humor. It was like standup comedy content.  Could have done without all the trashy language
B00AMBLDEE|5.0|This was the best movie that I have seen this year. It was a great lead in to a sequel.. Nice new character development too!
1476712042|5.0|Love this book and story. Can't wait for Walking Disaster as we get to hear Travis' side of the story. Read the snippets on Jamie's facebook or web page. So good can't wait.
1451673442|5.0|I received the book in the time frame promised and in the brand new condition promised.  I haven't read it yet but have started it and will definitely be reading this one through.
B00422LESO|4.0|This is  a great book, especially if you enjoy Jane Austen 's novels. As you this story you will fell as if you are Jane but, this  book does have some unexpected twists.
0525478817|5.0|The Fault In Our Stars is such a touching story with memorable characters. It is a must-read for people of all ages!
B00A6PD8RQ|4.0|This was a cute movie and I enjoyed being able to order from amazon.com with a click of a button.
1594744769|5.0|From the moment I first picked this book up, I could not put it down. The plot is captivating and keeps you on your feet. An unexpected tale and a must-read.
B001FB4W0C|3.0|I had no problems with the shipping or DVDs, everything was delivered on time with no flaws. The season came in 6 separate DVD boxes which is a pain and why I only rated this 3 stars. It would be easier, more space conscious, and more convenient if it had the standard packaging for most DVD seasons.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I loved the plot. Wish there was a prologue to let us know if they completed their family. Otherwise very cute story.
B008WCP2PG|4.0|This product arrived promptly and was in great condition. No problems and I love the movie. The only complaint is that the movie was sent in a HUGE box that could have fit probably 2 shoe boxes in. It wasn't a big deal just kind of annoying.
B007N5YIUS|4.0|Fun game! Because it's space, the physics of it is slightly trickier. Definitely fun way to kill time! I know I'll be playing it for a while.
B003TSEEDY|3.0|It was a very interesting book. I somewhat enjoyed the diary format of the book. I wouldn't mind seeing the movie.
B001706I5I|5.0|A great holiday movie with a wonderful message! All of my children ages 8-14 loved this movie as did adukts and grandparents!

B001NLKT60|4.0|If you liked the Girl with the Dragon Tatto you'll like this one to. Continued reference to the movie story line makes it all come  together. Good story as a follow up to the original story.

B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is very addicting. You want to challenge yourself and keep playing it. Sometimes longer than you had intended!
B006X5L6VS|2.0|NIGHT SKY is a Ho hum app. When I hold up my device, the stars don't relocate.  The instructions are non exsistant. I bought an app that is a mystery to use. Also, there is another app that this app keeps asking me to buy to make this App run better. What's up with that?
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I first read The Perks of Being a Wallflower when I was 12 or so. I loved the book then, but that was before I'd been in love, or drunk, or stoned, and before I had been on long drives at night with best friends and felt infinite.<br /><br />This is a story about a teenager who doesn't have a 'crowd' and doesn't really know who he is - so most anyone who has been through high school, or is experiencing it now, can relate. While the story focuses on the less than popular crowd, it sheds a different light on the popular kids, showing that they also have secrets and fear judgment just like everyone else. And then it shows a glimpse of what it feels like to be looked down on by that crowd, and on the same page shows what it's like to<br />level the playing field with them.<br /><br />For the person who saw things a little differently, or experienced unrequited love, or didn't feel truly alive until meeting their very best friends, this book will serve as affirmation that even when you thought you were the only one feeling those things, and worried you'd never belong, there were other people out there feeling the same way. And that it all comes down to perspective and to living life for yourself.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|Not at all what I was expecting, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing. Charlie's tale tugs at your heart strings as you witness first hand a boy just trying to fit in and reconcile with his past.
B001R3YRG2|5.0|One of my favorite Michael Douglas movies! Jam packed with action. So if thats your thing. This is for you.
030758836X|5.0|Gillian Flynn is one of my new favorite authors after reading this novel.  This thriller twists and turns -- I wasn't sure who was the bad guy from one part to the next.  No figuring out 'who dunnit' for me -- loved it.
B009MCRHH6|4.0|The game is one of engaging puzzles that continuously challenge your capabilities.  And I really like the sounds the Goo's make as you work your way through the puzzle levels.  What I dont like is the sounds the Goo's make when you cascade into failure.  Very well designed and entertaining.
B000LTAY1U|1.0|Watched stopped in middle of night, reset it the next morning. Same thing next two nights. Figured it must have something to do with it being powered by movement of my arm. Sometimes I have to rest it. Returned it Dec. 26 and will select non-Seiko with similar style, which I like, in a few days.
0545128285|4.0|Bought this for a friend. She fell in love with it. I have my own copy and love the story
B002IJNI78|4.0|In the time it takes to view It's A Wonderful Life for the thirtieth-something time, you might enjoy this lighthearted poke at the holiday.  Modern-day Scrooge, Luther Krank, lives the dream we mortals can only imagine...casting aside the cumbersome, costly, threadbare traditions of Christmas celebration...in favor of a warm water cruise.  He's fifty-four, for heaven's sake, does he really need to haul a forty-pound, five-piece plastic Frosty the Snowman to the topside of the eaves?  Oh, to dispense with the ritual and pomposity of this secular holiday!<br /><br />The book is charming, and a quick read.  I felt somewhat robbed at page 2 to realize that I'd already seen the movie version.  (The B grade movie starred Tim Allen, and was OK, even if this plot seems tailor made for Cary Grant.) Still, this book should be a classic, to be read year-after-year, at the hearth on Christmas Eve, as a family holiday tradition...no wait, err, maybe not?  Oh dear!
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I enjoyed this book. It was a very quick and easy read. It was somewhat predictable, but helped pass a lazy afternoon nicely.
B000VHMF0A|5.0|Got this on a great deal - wouldn't have thought of getting it, but saw it and thought, why not.  Very enjoyable - nothing on it not to like.
B009VLX8FS|5.0|I heard the first single We are never ever getting back together, and I was disappointed. I thought Taylor had changed her style completely from country to pop, and I missed the old Taylor Swift songs. Then I heard Begin Again and I knew that country music still had an influence on her writing. I also became drawn to the single I Knew You Were Trouble, as it is very catchy.<br />I recently bought the album and have not listened to all the tracks yet, but I am looking forward to it.<br />She is a promising artist who continues to amaze me with her accomplishments. I would recommend this album to anyone who likes country music and pop music, as she does segue into pop on some of the tracks. I believe the album could be enjoyed by people of all ages, including longtime Taylor fans such as myself, and new fans as well.
034580404X|5.0|The set shipped and arrived within expected time.  It was a gift for a friend, and unfortunately, she has already read it and will be returning it for something else.  Would definitely order from this vendor again.
B005LAIHZY|4.0|Was great to sit down as a family and watch this.  The entire family, including 10yo daughter and 7yo son, enjoyed it which is a plus.
B008MG1E4A|3.0|Though the story is captivating there is less detail beyond what we knew before. It mainly tells about US power.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great read. Loved all the characters,the story line,and even the ending. Ruthless but not gory. Loving moments but not mushy. I'm excited to read the rest of the trilogy.
B009VB7QQA|5.0|This movie was great for the whole family.  Vampires with a twist of history.  The movie kept us enthralled the entire time.
B004H1V5RU|4.0|I bought this as a gift for my 9 year old nephew this year.  It is in constant use by one of the 7 people in the house at any given time.  You have to figure out where the ball is going, how to keep it on the track, and you need to concentrate.  It is fun and engages your brain.  I liked it so much that I am getting one for my house, too.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|It's nothing fancy but it's easy to get started and has a nice variety of layouts. I highly recommend it.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This the best game ever since never it's the best ever<br />I will get this game for all my digital things
B000002O51|5.0|What can i say other than a good album along with the first two. I saw them in concert back in the 70s (my 1st concert) and stood right in the front row near the speaker. My ears were still ringing the next day. LOL. Tom Scholz is/was a genius at creating a new sound for rock and roll. Brads voice was one of the best. Thanks Tom and Co. R.I.P. Brad.
B009D5VNLS|5.0|But it is for an older audience. My daughter is almost 3 and loves a lot of Pixar and Disney movies, this one she couldn't get through. My husband and I loved it though.
B000007XUQ|5.0|I love the Carpenters Christmas Portrait.  I had it on cassette and haven't been able to locate it. This was a really good buy with the second CD too!
B005WKKI96|1.0|I had hoped for more after reading several positive reviews on Amazon. I used to like her music very much and felt it captured the spirit of a Mexico that is fast vanishing, one that I knew from years of personal experience.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Lila Downs has lost her way both musically and as an icon. Her songs are now just highly commercialized background noise with no real identity, unlike the best ones (e.g., La sandunga, Sabor a mi, Tengo miedo de quererte, and many of those that incorporated indigenous languages) on her early CDs.
0486275590|5.0|I knew my 2 kids had not read this book.  This is a classic book that all kids should read at least once. I had a whole collection of classics, Black Beauty, Huckleberry Finn, Tom Sawyer, etc. Kids nowadays have no idea what white wash a fence means, lol.
1449433251|5.0|Books are perfect for passing many hours, lost in Calvin's imagination. A recommended buy for any fan of the strip.
B005ZMTXMY|5.0|My wife and I (over 40) love this movie, and our 2-1/2 year old daughter has been watching it constantly since we bought it. See it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Awesome. Read the whole book in one day,could not put it down. Would definitely recommend this book to read for everyone
B005LAIIQC|5.0|As an early fan of the Bourne movies (I rated Identity a five star in 2002), I like this movie very much. It gave me the same thrill and satisfaction as the previous installments did, which are essentially good espionage conspiracy plots well packaged with great actions and high paced cinematograhy. As a professional businessman, I love it even more. With Damon's refusal to act as Bourne for a fourth time and under the pressure from Universal to take advantage of previous successes worldwide, I am obliged to praise the superb intelligence and skill of the screenwriter turned director Tony Gilroy (he wrote for all three previous ones) for the completion of such a high quality action movie leveraging on storylines of Ultimatium yet without compromsing the overall style and structure, whilst maintaining the upside in case Damon agrees to return or Renner is accepted in his new hero role as Aaron Cross. Certainly the outstanding acting of Weisz and Norton had added much value and attraction as well. Whilst many reviewers criticized that the two Oscar grade star actor and actress should not have taken part in this overstretched extension, I applaud their wisdom to appreciate the potential of it. IMHO, the final product and the updated worldwide boxoffice $276M (vs a $125M budget) had proved them right though it's still far below the $443M of Ultimatum. BTW, the chase scenes in Manila are superb! In short, highly recommended! Looking foward to a fifth or even sixth addition from either Damon or Renner, hoping that the coming one(s) will be as good as this!
146500632X|5.0|My daughter loves it!  It has great pictures.  Makes a terrific gift for any young girl who loves One Direction.
0345803485|1.0|Left Coast liberal here. I have an open mind and have a curiosity about BDSM. That and the book's big following got me to read it.<br /><br />All I can say is, what a waste! Where were the editors? Book reads like a 17-year-old dreamer wrote it and did not consult an editor nor make use of a basic thesaurus. The 79th time that Christian \\"murmurs\\" or the 89th time that Ana says \\"Oh, my\\" - you are ready to throw the book across the room. And you are only 40% through it.<br /><br />The two characters are unsympathetic. Christian is simply a disgusting and not attractive character, and not because he practices BDSM but because he has no relational interests or skills. A robot. You want to root for Ana, but 100% of her self esteem derives from Christian's attention. As a female character she manages to be neither strong, interesting, nor even playful.<br /><br />Cringeworthy.<br /><br />I'll bet there are one or two really compelling books out there, fiction or nonfiction, on BDSM. If anyone has a recommendation...I am all ears. THIS book was a complete waste.

B007IXWL2C|5.0|I enjoyed reading it very much.  I couldn't wait for the next book to start, and I even had my husband read parts of it.  It was erotica that was sociably acceptable.
B005VPRETE|5.0|My 6 year old girl LOVES the LEGO Friends series of toys.  From the smallest which she can finish on her own in minutes, to the largest (the house) which we worked on together.  The attention to detail is just astounding - in a good way.  This tree house kit has a ladder that folds up and down; a little telescope; and a fish for the cat.  Each of these details elicits a delighted response from my daughter.<br /><br />The directions are clear even for those of limited literacy. For a kit of this complexity, she generally manages about 75-80% completely on her own.  I get called in for interpretation sometimes when the angle is weird or there are alot of pieces; or when she's getting tired and just needs a teammate (I will read the instructions out, she'll find and place the pieces)<br /><br />The results are just adorable without being nauseating.  Yes, they're \\"girly\\" but LEGO manages to do it in a way that isn't demeaning or insulting.  My daughter LIKES that the figures are cute and come with tiny hair accessories. What can I say? But she's developing excellent spatial awareness and manual dexterity and the ability to follow directions, just like her Big Brother is with Hero Factory.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book changed my perspective on ... everything, really. At many times I found myself smiling and ... crying. This is definitely one of the best books I have ever read and recommend it for all who need closure ... or just need a really amazing read.

B003YV0A02|5.0|It's a classic and the actors are superb.  A unique kind of Christmas movie and great entertainment with some memorable one liners.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Excellent value. This is a classic blu ray to purchase and watch over and over. Highly recommend this to anyone.
B001VLXNLU|4.0|A good story but it has such poor character design that it keeps the reader from absolutely loving the book.
B00AMBH70S|5.0|Wonderfully acted - Jeremy Renner is amazing!! Please keep building on this series, want to see more and and more!!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|It is a lot of fun to play and i have passed it on to others who also love it.
B007ATNHLI|5.0|Esta en muy buenas condiciones. La pelicula es muy buena. Llego para el tiempo acordado. La definicion en el blu ray es muy buena
B002MQYOFW|5.0|What shocked me was when I read that the mutant dogs were the killed tributes. It made me want too read that part over and over again unroll the shock was finally gone.
B00198X0VS|5.0|la secuela de MIB esta brutal. Dan a apreciar las criaturas de ciencia ficcion y a la misma vez es muy comica.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|What can I say.  This is a beautiful, well developed series and it's stunning in Blu-ray.  Nature never look so good.  So much new to learn.
B009JBZH54|5.0|La mejor triologia de batman, hasta el momento. La pelicula se vive como si fuera un ecenario real. a los fan les va a gustar.
B006LPI0N2|5.0|You must hear this voice.  A great singer.<br />There are more complete recordings on Decca  Get them or miss out.
B004SDEP38|5.0|I purchashed this app for my Kindle Fire to keep me on the go. It fulfilled all my expectations for a mobile app and much more. I can edit documents in word, excel, Powerpoint and Access with ease.it also offers various options for saving.I would definitely recommend
B007I2BZIE|4.0|Buy this from Amazon only(no 3rd. parties). The first one I bought 3-4 Mos. ago had a crack in plastic/big scratch. Amazon gave me a refund promptly without returning.  My Husband still wanted it so when I looked THIS TIME I see Amazon was selling it & had the S,S. shipping.  We rec'd. it & it was in good condition.
B005LAII62|5.0|I LOVED THIS MOVIE BECAUSE I LOVE SCARY CARTOONS! IT WAS REALLY GOOD. I RECOMMEND IT. IT HAS SOME REALLY FUNNY STUFF IN IT AND SOME SCARY. I LOVE HOW HE SEES ALL THE GHOSTS AND THEY JUST HAVE LITTLE CHATS ON HIS WAY TO SCHOOL! TOO COOL!
B00A0SKFLG|5.0|It was a lot better than I expected. Of course with Kate Beckinsale in it how could it be bad?
B009FB3XTA|5.0|I DON'T USUALLY LOVE ALL THE SONGS ON ANY CD OR MOVIE CD BUT THEY HIT IT ON THE NAIL FOR ME ON THIS SOUNDTRACK! I DEFINATELY RECOMMEND THIS CD!
B0086700CM|4.0|Temple Run is an addictive game. It is great for wasting time on long car rides. It was the first game I downloaded on my Kindle Fire. I am giving it four stars due to the fact that sometimes it doesn't respond to my finger swipes, but now I have a stylus so that problem doesn't occur that often. It is very fun to try and achieve all the goals that there are in this game.
B00966TN1Q|2.0|I am a huge fan of Michael Connelly's books. He is my favorite crime writer. His stories are truly gripping. So expectations were high for this new book, and I have to say that it was disappointing. In terms of content, it felt like to was half the excitement and intrigue of his other books.<br />So in conclusion, I am still a huge fan, and I am sorry to have to write a review that is not so glowing. I look froward to the next book!
B0049P1VHS|5.0|I love this show so much! This is the only show that gives me nightmares (and that's a good thing).<br />I wanted to own the first season because I love it. I'm still a fan but there is something about the first season I guess because it was new.<br />Very recommended!
B00A9C3RB8|4.0|Its a quirky film that will entertain you.  It moves a little a slow but all in all it was worth taking a look at.
B0083P1QUM|4.0|This was classic Cornwell/Scarpetta. A return to what we all loved. Most definitely better than the last book. I recommend to anyone who is a Cornwell/Scarpetta fan.
B0083GQKQG|3.0|The acting was great but nobody really says anything until about an hour into the movie. You just have to figure out why this woman is so depressed by going between the present and past without much dialog.  I did find alot of the script interesting.  It seems that the only person and time that Kevin shows a tiny bit of respect is when he has been disiplined, which doesn't happen often from his dad.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|This app needs to be updated.  I love my Kindle Fire, but hate the FB app that goes with it.  You only get to see the first few posts the way they should be, then the rest are in list form.  Please fix this!!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Loved it!!!!! At the end I tried to stop reading so much at once, I didn't want the book to end :)
B002K0WBXW|5.0|I think I own just about every Sandra Bullock dvd out there,but this is one of my favorites! I absolutely love this movie! The dvd i recieved was used,but like new,it was a great price,and shipping was fast! I'm very happy!
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|This is the best freakin' movie that I've seen in years. Originally thought that this would be really stupid but I haven't laughed like this in years. Mark is so funny in this movie. The bear totally stole the show but it had really good humor and kept my attention which is hard to do. I would totally watch this again.
B004EPZ034|5.0|I bought these dvd's for my kids for xmas,and my 14 yr old son even loves them! They were a big hit! Good price,and fast shipping! I'm very pleased!
B00004ZB9D|4.0|This was a great album, I enjoyed it when it first cam out and loved that I can listen to it again
B007XHWROK|5.0|How can you go wrong with a Justin Bieber cd?! :) My 10 yr old daughter is a BIG fan,and i bought this cd for her for xmas. It was one of her fav presents! I often catch myself singing the songs too! lol
B001D0DQUC|5.0|Watched this with my teenager who had never seen it and it was so awesome! Quality of the video was very good especially considering how old the film is.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This is a gorgeous app on the Kindle Fire.  It's beautifully designed, easy to use, easy to configure, full of use features. I love the Google-related weather maps.
B00APUYN0I|5.0|This was my second time seeing this movie and I still found it super funny. It's humor is adult without being too over the top (yes Bridesmaids and The Hangover I'm calling you out). It is appropriate for a pre-teen and older. Rumor Wilson (aka Fat Amy) is the BOMB!
B0094BB4TW|2.0|It only gives me about 10 status updates and then dosen't work beyond that.  I'm not sure what I should do, maybe reload it again? Anyway, I'm not impressed.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|Picked this up on an Amazon Instant Deal and couldn't be happier. Great price for a great set. We love the West Wing and now watch an episode every night! The case is nice and heave weight and the discs are grouped in season &#34;folders&#34; so it looks like you have an official government file box. Very nice.
B001EQ5ZJK|5.0|I wonder about instruction or catalog for our body and genes was a possible answer but with this book,i agree with that environment and subconscious Mind have the right answer.
B005KJZDW6|5.0|Fantastic album! A She &Him twist on all the Christmas classics! A download card was also included. I LOVE this album!!
B0062NAVXA|5.0|Loved it! Very sad in a arty of parts but the good parts take over!  It's good to have a movie about Christians  that aren't  looking like fools or  made fun of! It's  nice to have a feel good movie!
0425263916|2.0|I got tired of reading the same &#34;break-up and make-up scenario.&#34; Sylvia Day needs to become more creative. I won't be buying her third book and I didn't finish this one either!
B005LAJ17M|4.0|I enjoy what the plot is trying to do, but the CIA agent is one of the most annoying and immature characters. I know I will probably get a lot of crap for that.
B0058EBNAO|5.0|I liked this app from when I first bought it some months ago. It works extremely well on the Kindle Fire HD 7. The latest update to version 4.6.4 (today for me) allows you to put just about anything on the radar map or remove it at a tap. What is really nice are the various alerts/and warnings that show up by area, just a tap on it and you can see what kind of alert it is and tap again if you  want to read the entire item. Personally I think its a very fair priced app for all that it does. Everything works.<br />Also a web/site and forum for questions.
B000VMFDW2|5.0|This was a great book to read about what happened in the Pacific Theater during World War II. E.B. Sledge's first hand account of what happen on Peleliu and Okinawa is amazing it really gives you an idea of what it was like be there.
073933235X|1.0|I bought this as an audio CD.  First of all Anthony Bourdain reads the book.  He reads entirely too fast and in a monotone.  He claims to love his profession but his description of his career and the people he has known is primarily sarcastic.  I really hated his vulgarity.
B00AGOGOLE|3.0|I can't figure out how to delete unwanted videos and it won't let me save or email them!!! Otherwise is a good camera quality =)
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I chose 5 stars because this book was plain AWESOME. Suspense, action, a *bit* of violence, and a love triangle. It was just AWESOME, no other way to put it. LOVED IT. The evil capitol, the poor districts, the crazy fashion, and the fighting. <3
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|this was a good game for a hidden object game. it had a good story line with a few different mini games. not bad for $3. it took me two days but several hours each.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I down loaded this game for my grandchildren.  They enjoyed it. All of them found it easy to play. Thank you.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|The story was not only interesting but humorous at times. Lost at sea with a wild tiger in a small boat is an amazing adventure. I'll never forget Robert Parker!
B002JWD6AS|5.0|This book has been amazing, around every corner is a new surprise. There were moments I was in tears, moments I was laughing my butt off, and moments I was crying telling the characters what to do.<br />This book is a must read!
B005IZLPMY|5.0|excellent condition and amazing effects....good viewing for the family....good story line up and good cast .... .... ..... ..... ......
B008ASLK8A|5.0|I enjoyed the whole series but I also was a big fan of the original television series. And yes I do watch Elementary!!
0321857895|5.0|It improved my note taking interest and skill. I can recall more of what the subjects was about and specfic details
