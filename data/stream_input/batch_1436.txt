B007SYWFRM|1.0|My 5-year old added this game to my Kindle Fire.  Okay, no big deal since it cost $0.00.  I looked it over one evening and I couldn't get out of it!  I had to shut down the Kindle Fire completely to shut the game off.  Needless to say that was very annoying.  Then this afternoon I was reading my emails when I saw 5 purchases on my Amazon account to my kindle..  YES, my 5 year old bought $25 worth of something for this stupid game!  I removed the game remotely and I am very angry at this company for creating a game trap where you cannot get out and can buy your way into points, or whatever.

B006QVRVJK|5.0|\\"Carnage\\" is an adaptation of Yasmina Reza's original stage play \\"Le Dieu du carnage (God of Carnage)\\" for the big screen, written and directed by Roman Polanski, in a translation from the original French by Michael Katims. Owing to Polanski's fugitive status in the USA, it was filmed (despite its Brooklyn setting) in Paris.<br /><br />The film makes excellent use of minimal set additions to the original stage production and the four cast members are all outstanding in their performances. The story itself is a comedy of manners, as two sets of parents to teenage boys meet in an attempt to resolve matters arising from a playground scrap between their respective sons.  The script explores the basis and boundaries of politeness versus honesty, social conscience versus self-interest and portrays the disastrous consequences of testing those boundaries. The excruciating shallow play-acting of social correctness is gradually replaced by the increasingly painful exposition of the truth as social hypocrisies are systematically dissected to display the selfish core.<br /><br />Throughout the film's 80-minute duration, allegiances and alliances shift, battle lines are drawn and redrawn, as prejudices, obsessions, fears and foibles are successively exposed, probed and ridiculed, emotions running high as opinions and values are successively attacked and defended; and the opening tensions are dissipated through farce.<br /><br />The script sticks closely to the original stage version, varying only in providing a neat storyline twist using the opening and closing title visuals, which poignantly shows up both the futility of the parents' attempts to resolve issues through their own \\"grown-up and adult\\" discussions, as well as the fact that all are equally at fault. The humour is subtle in its steps but hilarious in its cumulative effect. Those who know the play may be disappointed with Polanski's direction, which gives a less intimate but more claustrophobic feel to the enterprise. The film is nevertheless first rate and is heartily recommended.The film is nevertheless first rate and is heartily recommended.
0439023513|5.0|After reading the first two books of the series, I thought I had a pretty good idea of how the final book would turn out--a lot of exciting action scenes, some moral ambiguity, but ultimately good triumphs over evil.  I'm sure most of the book's fans (and certainly those who tuned in after seeing the movie) expected something similar.  And a book like that would have been a fitting ending, generally satisfying to most people.<br /><br />But, surprise! surprise!--Suzanne Collins decided not to go in that direction.  Instead she wrote one of the most human and moving books in this sort of genre that I have ever read.  At the end I was crying for Katniss, and Prim, and the cat, and Peeta, and Finnick, and Haymitch and the other characters I had come to love, and whose lives were scarred by the powerful forces that had used them as pawns in their game.  Collins gives us a real taste of the impact of war on the individual humans that are thrown into it.  The Hunger Games in this book is not of 24 individuals fighting as entertainment for the home viewing audience, it is tens of thousands of people fighting to serve the personal ambitions of a few powerful people at the top of the pyramid.  The fighting is not the central point of this book--we know how that is going to turn out.  The point is what happens to the people--and Collins doesn't take the easy way out on this front; we're presented with a lot of very difficult, very sad and very real consequences that just took my breath away.<br /><br />I loved this book.

B006UTJ6DM|5.0|There are a lot of Titanic haters out there, and I'm not one of them. James Cameron made an extremely romantic Hollywood epic that deserves the praise and billions of dollars to its name. You could probably sink 10 Titanics with all the tears created from this movie over the years, and all that credit goes to James Horner's magnificent and timeless score. While traditionalists will complain of his use of synth vocals and overuse of his \\"danger motif\\" one can't deny the visceral power of this score. Everyone and their mother can identify this score just from a few notes, and that speaks volume. If this music connects with that many people then James Horner was definitely doing something right. It's undoubtedly one of his most accomplished works and is a thing of pure beauty. For the 100th anniversary of the sinking and 15th anniversary of the film Sony has revisited the soundtrack. The 4 discs include remastered versions of the original two releases as well as a large selection of period music.<br /><br />The score for Titanic is the best of James Horner and everything he offers as one of the greatest composers in the industry. Within the first few seconds of listening to this I was immediately transported back to the film and when you close your eyes something magical does indeed happen. It's powerful stuff when music lives within you and can be reawakened so easily. For people my age we grew up with this film and this score. I remember having the 2-VHS set of the movie and I remember having the soundtrack when I was little. The hymns and arrangements strike deep. There's something so richly romantic about it and everyone knows it. The tragedy that echoes throughout the entire score foreshadows everything that is to come right from the start. This is truly one of the most memorable scores you will ever hear and it's great to be able to revisit like no time has past at all.<br /><br />Titanic has every bit of James Horner within the score. It's his score from deep within and represents everything he is as a composer. Titanic is not only one of the best selling soundtracks of all time, but one of the most universally recognized. This is a perfect time to revisit this wondrous score and Sony has given us the best presentation possible.thin and represents everything he is as a composer.

B006VFLIYK|5.0|I have read all of his books and this was the best yet.  You end up caring so much about the characters. A  suspensful, exciting read!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I'm not much of a reader. but I got the Kindle fire for a Christmas gift, and thought I'd start out with a popular book. The Hunger Games was an entertaining and easy read. It was so good that I had to finish the trilogy. I would highly recomend this book.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|A great legal thriller -- as a mom, as a dad, what would you think?  What would you do if your son were accused of murder? This book drew me in and I could not put it down.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|In my opinion, the books are excellent for the age group being targeted (teens and young adults), and the content is strong enough to pull in many older adults. It is one of the few books out there that parents and their older kids can both read and enjoy, even for kids that nearly abhor pleasure reading.<br /><br />That is not to say that the book is extraordinarily well written or that the characters are thoroughly developed. The author does a reasonable job with those kinds of things, enough to create a story that has become a sensation across the country, but there was enough room for improvement as to be worthy of note. Such things will stand out more for the adults who are more oriented towards classical literature and other works that are, if anything, meticulous. Yet, for those who do not require the highest style of writing, the story itself is deep and haunting.<br /><br />As my own younger relatives have commented, the main character seems \\"weird\\". It is hard to get inside her head, and that makes some of her actions and the surrounding situations a bit more difficult to follow. While it is typically expected that the main character in a novel written in first person be created so the reader can identify, it is important to understand that the vast majority of us have not lived the kind of harsh life Katniss is supposed to have lived. Her own background is reason enough that it would be difficult to identify with her.<br /><br />The actual plot of the novels is what keeps everyone from wanting to put it down (again, in my opinion). It is a powerful tale that really does make the reader think. How can there be people who actually enjoy the Hunger Games? How can so many people be willing to starve at the hands of the government that deprives them and then remain silent when their children are taken to be so publicly murdered?<br /><br />Regarding this specific Kindle edition, for the most part, it was transcribed fairly well, but there are a fair few more errors than I would have expected in a print book.<br /><br />I would say that, all things considered, it is a good book, very enjoyable, and strong, while still having a bit of room for improvement in all areas. 4 out of 5 stars.

B007WPM4V4|4.0|While lacking the drama of Lane decking Pete that made last week's episode such a delight, this week's episode of Mad Men continued the tradition of character and quality that Mad Men is known for. The most interesting aspect of the show is watching Peggy develop as a character. First, she argued with a client about a pitch, pointing out that the guy was arguing just to argue. Peggy was right but was taken off the account anyway, a little nod to the new working women of that time. They might have a job but the standards of female behavior are still different from those for men.<br /><br />But, even more poignant was Peggy's interaction with Ginsberg. Ginsberg informs Peggy that he is adopted and that he 'feels like a Martian' and is looking for others of his kind, a statement that Peggy alone can understand. There is nothing in the dialogue about this, but long-time viewers will see the thought of Peggy's own lost baby shadow her face during the interaction.<br /><br />In terms of nostalgia the episode reminds us just how popular Howard Johnson's was in the sixties and seventies. All in all a strong episode that develops character rather than plot. A-.

0871404133|1.0|This book is exactly the kind of subject that I love to read about. Unfortunately, it is pure twaddle. The author is an expert on insects: particularly bees, ants, wasps and termites.  He knows a lot about them and he finds lessons to be learned for human development from a study of ant colonies. When he gets to talking about human development in the second half of the book he provides the type of lesson that an expert on insects can bring to human nature. To understand human nature \\"it is useful to bring into the light those other social conquerors of earth, the highly social ants, bees, wasps and termites and I will do so.\\"<br /><br />What has man done? He has \\"developed a primitive language-based civilization...that is destroying its own biosophere\\". \\"They have diverted a large part of the fresh water for their own use, acidified the ocean, and changed the atmosphere to a potentially lethal state.\\"  \\"The origin of modern humanity was a stroke of luck--good for our species for a while, bad for most of the rest of life forever\\"<br /><br />Despite this depressing beginning, I waded through the rest of the book. I learned nothing new, and much that made it clear to me that bee's nests and ant hills have little to teach us about human development.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|Not being much of a writer myself, I hesitate to write reviews, but for Wool I'll make an exception. I read a lot of dystopia and post apocalyptic fiction, but was becoming a bit bored with all the teenage characters and/or similar premises. Wool was so different and well written, I was hooked the first chapter.  The characters are well developed, the world incredibly detailed, it was very easy to get caught up in this series. Not much I can add but to say thank you to Hugh Howey for creating such a great story. (and as a knitter, I loved the knitting references). Looking forward to reading more!!

B007IXWL2C|5.0|Book 3 was just as heavy and heady as 1 & 2. On the Hot & Steamy front: Just as HOT HOT HOT. I feel like I have been in a Christian and Ana fog for days. I blew through all 3 books in a span of a week if that gives any indication of how awesome these books have been. As in Books 1 & 2: Its an emotional heavy as Christian is a walking bag of luggage but a heavy that leaves you wanting to NOT put the book down. I had to remind myself over and over that they are a young couple. I am in my 40's and many times thought \\"I wouldnt put up with this crap\\". Christians journey to deal with his personal demons are extremely heavy but just as fast as those emotional demons come out, he struggles and breaks though to the softer side inch by inch with Ana at his side. You really are catapulted in to these 2 character's lives. I enjoyed ready all of the texts between these characters throughout all 3 books..very witty. Well Ms. James, you have ruined any chance of my finding any other romance novels to read. You have set the bar to a whole new high and I cant imagine anything will even come close to comparison. Now that I have read all 3 books..what do I read now? Perhaps I should get to the laundry I have neglected all week.......

B003SWNRU2|5.0|Blood of The Nations should have been the metal album of the year ! Accept comes back after 10 years of waiting on Udo with a new singer Mark Tornillo from TT Quick and knocks it out of the park. This release is my favorite Accept album and a full on metal assault that simply put kicks ass. No more sitting on the side lines Accept takes the bull by the horns and puts out a headbanger album that puts the metal world on notice that they are back and back with a vengence.<br /><br />  Many Accept fans may not want to accept ( pun intented ) that this band can carry on bigger and better without Udo but they have with Bood of The Nations. I guarnatee that once you give this cd a listen you will agree with me Accept is back in the game.

B006CC0YB0|5.0|This is a very good Lanegan recording. One of his best. He's dealing with big subjects here and that's what I like. The philosophical, religious and spiritual elements of this recording are what appeals to me. The dark, haunting quality of his voice has always served him well. He's done many collaborations over the years and most of them are very good. Especially with Isobel Campbell. Those with her are among my favorites. This album has a \\"bigger\\" sound than his other work, however. Some of this really rocks. Some of it's somber.<br /><br />I love the lyrics and the way he puts himself into the songs in a masculine bluesy fashion. Most of the \\"death metal \\" groups that deal with the same subject matter have weak vocalists compared to Lanegan. I dig it....and I know that many people may find it depressing but I find it life affirming.  The theme of blood, death and loss are true to the facts. That's the way it is.....this album and this kind of music makes me appreciate life and my loved ones all the more....like going to the blue church. As mentioned by other reviewers here, the music supporting Lanegan's singing is just terrific. It's different from his other solo work and the more I listen to it the more I like it. Very talented group of musicians. The funeral arrangement on the cover is a very nice touch.<br /><br />The album \\"Broken\\" by the Soulsavers with Lanegan on most of the lead vocals is another gem, if you like this one. Check it out...

B007CKNX28|5.0|If Jack White hasn't created a masterpiece in \\"Blunderbuss,\\" he's come damn close. Proving he has quite a future post-White Stripes, he has cobbled together a collection of tunes that pulse, soothe and always rock, flying by in a slick, fast-moving fashion. It marks one of those rare occasions where a mental and spiritual exorcism for the artist is also a destined pleasure for those interested in absorbing his art.<br /><br />Unpretentious, callow, straightforward, laid-back - these are hardly attributes that applied to White previously, and now that he is relying solely on his own instincts and proclivities this is even more pronounced. Oftentimes he veers up and down the emotional scale several times within the same song, taking the listener in unexpected directions that provide a roadmap of both his disillusionments and idiosyncrasies.<br /><br />To be sure, White is a restless presence on \\"Blunderbuss\\" - lamenters of the demise of White Stripes will find a musical life boat within its gripping, extremely impressive 42 minutes. Thematic comparison to Dylan's \\"Blood on the Tracks\\" is certainly justified. This is an album of one man's heartbreak and the turmoil, introspection and eventual resurrection which followed.<br /><br />His elegant, rapturous playing on his Rhodes and his grand, aggressive guitar playing bolster the tunes with a full-bodied precision that is by now expected. The extremely catchy \\"Freedom at 21,\\" which features a fiery, inspired near-rap, is illustrative of the latter, while the schizophrenic, relatively quiet \\"Hypocritical Kiss\\" exemplifies the former.<br /><br />This is music that not only compels repeated plays but reveals further treasures with them. There is an immediacy to White's often unsettling vocal performances, as though he walked into the recording booth to lay down the tracks immediately after tweaking the final melody lines. He minces no words and purges his emotions unrepentantly. This works since the swelling, often riotous music surges forth to sync up with his dour sentiments.<br /><br />\\"I want love to grab my fingers slowly, slam them in a doorway, put my face in the ground\\" from \\"Love Interruption\\" is characteristic of his self-effacement. It seems he will not attend any speed-dating sessions in the near future. As a matter of fact, his wrenchingly negative opinion of women (and love in general) is made so clear that it would not be altogether surprising were NOW to issue a formal response to the album.<br /><br />Most important is the vintage of the music, however, and Jack White proves himself to be an incredible musician here. He is a fascinating and frustratingly enigmatic talent who consistently makes choices that are not merely unorthodox but downright original, all the while expressing himself in a way that feels familiar - as though the sounds and sentiments he puts forth were already confirmed truths in search of a mouthpiece to report them to the world. That quality of conviction is rare and only part of what makes \\"Blunderbuss\\" a must-listen.music surges forth to sync up with his dour sentiments.<br /><br />\\"I want love to grab my fingers slowly, slam them in a doorway, put my face in the ground\\" from \\"Love Interruption\\" is characteristic of his self-effacement.

B003Z0BWRM|5.0|Clary Fray is a normal teenager living in New York City, but when she follows some other teenagers in a nightclub, she finds things are far from normal. She meets Jace, Isabelle and Alec and finds out they are Shadowhunters, demon hunters. Clary, along with her best friend Simon, gets pulled into their world. When Clary find out that she is also a shadowhunter by birth, she realises that her life will never be the same again.<br /><br />I had heard of this book on the review grapevine and was curious to know what all the hype was about. When I got this book, I was completely immersed in the world that Cassandra Clare had created. I absolutely loved it!<br />Clary Fray is a fantastic character. She seems to be a typical teen, but she has an ability she didn't know about. She can see through glamours, to see the world hidden behind them. The other characters in this book are fantastic too!<br />Her best friend Simon is a great guy. He's gorgeous, funny and sweet, and I wish I had a friend like him!<br />Isabelle is a wonderful character. I actually had thought she was a bit stuck up at first, but she grew on me!<br />Alec is Isabelle's brother, and has a warm and loving character.<br />Jace is swoon-worthy! I love his sense of humour - it's so sharp you could cut yourself with it! I can see why Clary would start to fall for him.<br />If you haven't already read this book, then I suggest you do so! This story is fast paced and kept me turning the pages! The world Cassandra has created is so life like, I keep expecting to see a werewolf or a vampire sitting in a cafe having dinner! I highly recommend this YA/Paranormal book if you love a fantastic story, with some wonderful characters that will take you on a wild ride!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Great read! The narrative was very engaging. The character development allows the reader to fully  attach themselves to the various characters. The pace of the novel is exceptional leaving the reader necessarily continuing on to the next chapter. As someone reported, you have to stop in mid chapter to rest. You cannot stop at chapter end,!
B002RI9ZPY|3.0|I bought this book through Amazon but was very disappointed by the high number of typing errors throughout the book.  I wonder is that a problem with the electronic version only or if the printed version is as bad?
B007V2UGPE|5.0|I want to just rate the game and not have to leave a comment.<br />But I need 3 more words.
0345803485|2.0|Oh my, the writing is bad. Holy cow, it's so bad that it's distracting. Wow! This a bestseller? Yes, I know, sex sells and that's fine, but there has got to be better erotica out there.<br /><br />It's impossible to review this book without revealing something about myself. If I write that the sex is wild and insane, then does that imply that I have a boring sex life? And if I write that the sex is plain vanilla, then does that imply that I have kinky sex life? So, although I do have my opinions about the sex in the book, I'll keep my personal life private.<br /><br />I will say this though, the writing is atrocious. The best part of the book takes place entirely in the reader's own imagination. While that doesn't sound like a criticism, as all novels take place in reader's imagination, it is and let me explain.<br /><br />Good writing guides the imagination and takes it to new heights. The words in Fifty Shades ground and stifle your imagination. Just as your mind is starting to picture a scene, your budding reverie is immediately struck down by the hundredth \\"wow\\" and the millionth \\"oh my\\". *Poof* all of a sudden you are brought back down to the real world of bad writing. Cue eye roll.<br /><br />This book also brought out a violent side of me that I never knew I had. I too wanted to beat the crap out of the heroine. Oh my! And not just her, but also her subconscious and especially her inner goddess. Wow, that inner goddess was seriously pissing me off.<br /><br />With my overwhelmingly negative critique, you might be wondering why two stars instead of one. Well, it isn't boring. The pages fly by quickly. Even though I am very much disappointed in this book, I still want to know what happens next. So, I couldn't possibly rate it only one star if I am curious about the next two books.
B004EPYZUS|2.0|The production values of this movie are good, and more Simon Pegg is a great addition.  Paula Patton is good too.  But here are my gripes:<br /><br />1. The bad guy is boring.  He needed 1-2 more scenes where we see what motivates him or why we are interested in him.  All we get is a 10 second news clip.<br /><br />2. Too much technology.  Every building they park next to, whether it's an international military installation or a library, they hack into and take over (elevators, etc) in two seconds.<br /><br />3. *** SPOILER ***<br /><br />The hotel scene is so elaborate and tense, but they wrote it too lazily:  It litterally would have made no difference if the team was not there at all.  They should have just murdered the bad guys as they walked out of the finished meeting.<br /><br />4. *** SPOILER ***<br /><br />Once Renner holds the launch codes to dozens of nukes and threatens to destroy them.  This is a great idea: Keep dozens of nukes out of terrorists' hands.  Tom Cruise says he would rather give the bad guys the nuke codes -- WHICH THEY ACTUALLY USE TO LAUNCH A NUKE AT THE USA -- because he wants to catch the bad guy.  Just another \\"jump the shark\\" moment.<br /><br />5. Tom Cruise gets in a fist fight with a 65 year old man as the climax.  Hmmm...
0060763280|4.0|As I read this book, I couldn'T help but think about how true everything he says is true. I couldn't believe how much thoughts affected my wealth.

I plan on attending his seminars.

B007CKNX28|5.0|What is it about Jack White? He blazes a trail where others follow, he captures the moment and he is always ten yards in the lead. On \\"Blunderbuss\\" his debut solo album all elements of White's recent past are to found with recognizable snatches of the White Stripes, The Raconteurs and his slightly less successful recent outing The Dead Weather. But White is not standing still, far from it since \\"Blunderbuss\\" is an incredibly varied album ranging from huge riff heavy hard rock anthems like \\"Sixteen Saltines\\" to the breezy jazzy pop of \\"Hip (eponymous) poor boy\\". More than this like Dylan's \\"Blood on tracks\\" the themes of break up and divorce runs through this album like a fault line and informs the lyrical preoccupations of many of the songs.<br /><br />It is true that White's split with British model Karen Elson seems amicable enough with the couple holding a party to celebrate the \\"making and breaking of the sacred union of marriage,\\" and indeed Elson does some background vocals on three of the songs here. Yet in the first half of \\"Blunderbuss\\" in particular White does rally against unhappy domestic predicaments, collapsing relationships and at one point the perfidy of women. You sense as the Americans politely put it that he has \\"issues\\" some of which are dramatically captured in the opener \\"Missing Pieces\\". While it is possibly the most White Stripeish song on the album its also has a strong confessional bent as White at one point muses that \\"When someone tells you they can't live without you, they ain't lying/ They'll take pieces of you and walk away.\\" albeit within the confines of a killer song exemplifying him at his absolute best. On \\"Freedom at 21\\" it gets even nastier with a greasy rolling riff which he must have held back from the Raconteurs and a rally against internet trolling where he stingily rebukes the perpetrator with the words \\"she don't care what kind of wounds she's inflicted on me/ she don't care what color bruises that she is leaving on me\\". It not all bitter and twisted however, far from it. The lovely title track \\"Blunderbuss\\" is almost a Robert Plant like lament by a wordy story, gorgeous piano lines and violins which conjure up echoes of another Dylan album namely \\"Desire\\". \\"Hypocritical kiss\\" is one of the best songs White has written in quite a time and it rolls along underpinned by strong melodic piano lines and shows White's complete mastery as a songwriter. It wouldn't be Jack White however without a nice blast of garage rock and nod to the Blasters cover of the Little Willie John standard \\"I'm Shakin\\" is completely nailed. Equally \\"Trash Tongue Talker\\" whilst breaking no new ground is a beautifully dismissive song dripping venom and owing a large debt James Booker. Other highlights include the dark acoustic ballad `Love Interruption' which combine White on a husky duet with Ruby Amanfu. Perhaps the two most distinct songs are kept until last not least the Beatles like dark pop of the brilliant \\"On and On\\" and finally the very funky \\"Take me with you when you go\\" which at the songs mid point breaks out in a pulsating sing-along and a fitting conclusion to an excellent album.<br /><br />Uncut has recently proclaimed \\"Blunderbuss\\" to be the obvious successor to \\"Get behind me Satan\\" the White Stripes fifth album and it is true that piano dominates as much as guitar on this album. White has also in an interview within the same magazine played down the confessional element to the album but he can be a contradictory cuss who regularly warns that many of his public statements are pure invention. What is certain is that \\"Blunderbuss\\" is a sure fire success, an album which is surly, aggressive yet calm and likeable in equal measures. White has bestrode the music scene like a colossus over the past ten years and the truly excellent \\"Blunderbuss\\" will reinforce this benevolent dictatorship.not all bitter and twisted however, far from it.

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I was curious about all the hype over the 'Hunger Games' written by Suzzanne Collins.  I am a believer in popular opinion.  If a majority of people find a book entertaining and literarily enjoyable, there is a reason.  I found the books similar to Huxley's, 'Brave New World,' and Orwell's, '1984,' in terms of exploring mankind's philosophical and political evolution.  She combined an interesting and emotional plot with the eternal conundrum,i.e. 'where have we been and where are we going as a society.'  Well worth the read.
B005K17RU0|5.0|its nice. I like knowing what the weather will be like. I just reviewed this so it would stop popping up.
1401924352|5.0|I bought this book for my niece. I also read it before I gave it to her. This is a great book for girls and yang women and my niece loves it!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|The Hunger Games is an excellent trilogy that you must read. More than a trilogy is one great story in three parts, which is why is great buy the three books together. Yea, this edition has some technical problems (the size of the letters change randomly for example) but you will be so deep on the story that you don't even notice those minimum details. Go ahead and buy the books, you will not regret it.

0439023491|5.0|The Hunger Games series is epic. That about sums it up in a few words. You know how some sequels are known to not hold the power of the first? Yeah, well Catching Fire was no exception. It was just as thrilling and surprising as the first book!<br /><br />After her Hunger Games victory, Katniss is back with her family and friends in District 12, but word gets around that her and Peeta unknowingly helped cause an unrest in the country of Panem. Suddenly, making people believe Peeta and her and in love is top priority, or else President Snow will step in. But, Katniss is thrown into all too familiar situations and getting Peeta out alive is her only mission, even if others have something else planned.<br /><br />Katniss is so empowering. I love her thoughts and feelings. I also liked the pull towards Gale and Peeta in Catching Fire. Katniss likes them both, but is emotionally confused and I feel as though it was a bit easier to connect with her, more on an emotional level. Haymitch is still as serious, yet goofy as ever...which is awesome! I really enjoyed the new characters introduced and I couldn't wait to learn more about them. Each district's lifestyle is so different that it was really great learning about them, however unfortunate their circumstances were.<br /><br />Suzanne Collins's writing is so amazing. I am eternally in awe of how amazing The Hunger Games series is. Generally, I'm not a huge fan of books that don't have a lot of dialogue, but these books are the exception. They are written more like a `live diary', where its all happening right on the spot. From Katniss's perspective it just comes off as that much more personal and I really loved that.<br /><br />Overall, please read Catching Fire! It kept me on my toes and clawed at my heart. Its a well rounded and very good read. If you haven't started the series...please do so. I promise you will not regret a single moment of it!<br /><br />For those who like: Dystopian, action, adventure/survival, strong heroines<br />Source: Boughtg heroines<br />Source: Bought
0553801473|2.0|So far there is no dancing going on. All the characters have become ones with no brain and not a thought before the stupidity. I have this book on kindle and have fast forwarded chapter after chapter. He writes about characters that I could give a flying flip for and only writes a little about whom I would think was the main characters. What is sad it has ruined the series on HBO for me as well. Why kill off so many of the main characters? Who cares what color every single person is wearing, or every detail of all their ancestors? It's liking reading history books in school except I paid for the book. Man and all the very detailed facts of the tortures. I wont be buying anymore of the books in this series, what would the point be? I think he got high and kinda wondered off.

B0052VUNHC|5.0|Love the character Travis in this story. He is damaged and all of the things you wouldn't want in a real life love interest but as a story it works perfectly. The author really gets inside the character's heads. Great read! (one thing I didn't care for was the whole card shark aspect. It was the one part of the story that seemed unbelievable to me.) I can not wait to read Travis's point of view. Should be just as good.

1583334386|5.0|We generally think of ourselves as one body and one mind ... a single unit working together.  But according to Kelly McGonigal, the author, \\"...we've seen again and again that we are not one self, but multiple selves.  Our human nature includes both the self that wants immediate gratification, and the self with a higher purpose.\\"  This is what makes self-control or willpower so difficult, we are actually fighting against ourselves.<br /><br />The benefits of self-control are significant.  \\"People who have better control of their attention, emotions, and actions are better off almost any way you look at it.  They are happier and healthier.  Their relationships are more satisfying and last longer.  They make more money and go further in their careers.\\"<br /><br />The Willpower Instinct is a guide for improving your self-control.  It is based on the award winning class which Ms. McGonigal teaches at Sanford University.  Her writing style is very conversational and entertaining.  She has a keen sense of humor which shows up throughout the book.  While she is a college professor, the book was written for the general public in easy to understand language.<br /><br />Many of the concepts in the book are counterintuitive.  We think the warning on cigarette packages should work to deter smoking.  They actually have the opposite effect.  \\"Frightening cigarette warnings can make smokers crave a cigarette, economic crises can make a person shop, and the nightly news can make you fat.\\"<br /><br />The book is filled with examples of how and why we have willpower failures and ways we can work around these failures.  \\"Self-control is a matter of understanding these different parts of ourselves, not fundamentally changing who we are.  In the quest for self-control, the usual weapons we wield against ourselves - guilt, stress and shame - don't work.\\"  What does work is self-awareness.  Paying attention to what is going on inside and realizing that there is a difference between thinking about something and acting on those thoughts.<br /><br />This book will give you a lot of insights into why we do the things we do, where our willpower fails us and why.  You will also find many exercises which will help you strengthen your willpower.  There is a lot of information in this book.  I doubt that you will be able to absorb all of it in one reading.  But it is very entertaining and should be studied and referred to often to help you build and strengthen your willpower.  It will have a significant impact on your life.<br /><br />Excellent resource for improving your willpower and your life.ng about something and acting on those thoughts.<br /><br />This book will give you a lot of insights into why we do the things we do, where our willpower fails us and why.

B0055PGUYU|5.0|Charles Duhigg, New York Times reporter, covers personal habits, the habits of societies and social movements (eg: why did Rosa Parks lead to the Montgomery Bus Boycott - believe it or not, social habits are involved) and the neuroscience of free will. Best news: habits can be broken, but you need to identify the cue and the reward to change the routine. Willpower is a muscle that needs to be exercised.<br /><br />Duhigg quotes William James: \\"All our life ... is but a mass of habits ... for weal or woe ... bearing us irresistibly toward our destiny. With that said I would also like to highly recommend this book: \\"[[ASIN:B007L7LJ7I Bioethics for Beginners: 60 Cases and Cautions from the Moral Frontier of Healthcare]] Both books are by two American intellectuals to take seriously the work of William James, both of are pragmatists, but Bioethics for Beginners explores the implications for medicine and science of what the Habits book says about life in general

0439023513|4.0|Katniss Everdeen, the girl on fire, is about to take on a new pseudonym, the Mockingjay.  She has survived two Hunger Games but is about to face her biggest threat yet, President Snow and the Capitol.  She has joined forces with the rebels and wants to make right, all the wrongs that have been done.  Mockingjay, by Suzanne Collins, is the third instalment in The Hunger Games trilogy, bringing an end to the tale of Katniss and her fellow tribute Peeta, from district twelve.  I found this instalment to be my least favorite of the three Hunger Games books, but I would still recommend it if you want to finish the journey with the characters you have grown to love.<br /><br />The story begins with Panem in civil war; no longer are the districts happy with their oppression.  They have lived for the past seventy-five years in poverty and starvation providing the Capitol with lavish luxury.  A similar synopsis can be found in the movie Demolition Man (1993) where a utopian society called San Angeles has been made by Dr. Raymond Cocteau.  Any people not willing to live under Cocteau's rules are forced to live in the sewers, fighting to stay alive and not die of starvation.  However, this all changes when Edgar Friendly brings the sewer dwellers together and declares civil war against the pampered overseers of San Angeles.<br /><br />We learn quickly the foreshadowed district thirteen is still alive and well.  In fact, the thirteenth district once known for its uranium production has now moved underground, its inhabitance living in an intricate maze of bunkers connected by elevators that move in all directions.  I couldn`t help but think of the Fallout video games where the world has been devastated by nuclear war and the few people left on Earth now live in vaults.<br /><br />The thirteenth district has become the home of the rebels, and they push the civil war ever closer to the Capitol.  Their efforts are slow yet their decision to create a symbol of hope and power to encourage the other districts to follow suit works to their advantage.  Katniss becomes the Mockingjay, hated by the Capitol and President Snow, yet loved by the oppressed.<br /><br />I would recommend this book if you liked the first two, but I must admit I did not enjoy it as much as I had hoped.  The story is told in first person, present tense, and it is hard at times to be inside Katniss's head as she deals with all her past traumatic experiences and inner conflicts.  I found the author used a great formula when writing the first two books, but the formula seemed to change with the third installment, setting the story apart, but not in a good way.  I'd still recommend this book, but I do not hold it to the same standards as I did the first two.  You'll have to read the story to find out what happens to Peeta and Gale, but Katniss has definitely found herself in the forefront of the civil war, dressed and ready to take on the Capitol as the Mockingjay.

B00005ATZT|5.0|This movie definately stands the test of time. You can watch it, forget about it for a few years, then watch it again and it's still a fantastic movie. I realize where the story/plot comes from and I feel this movie does it justice (no pun intended:). Great cast, excellent suspense, and as happy an ending as can be expected under the circumstances. This was back when filming in Chicago was fairly common; now it seems pretty rare and rarer still that Chicago is actually said in movies/television. Recommended for fans of the series, actors, and edge-of-your-seat aficianados.
B0000024W3|2.0|Self Portrait is, as you probably know, not really meant as a serious album.  Bob Dylan wanted to remove that \\"spokesman of a generation\\" tag that so many of us associate him with and... this is how he got rid of it!  Mediocrity from beginning to end.  Well, with a few exceptions.<br /><br />\\"All the Tired Horses\\" begins the album and reveals this is no highly exceptional Dylan experience but rather, well to be honest -as hard as this is to say about a musician I love to pieces and especially the fact it was released in 1970 when most artists were at the top of their game- a waste of your time.  It contains repetitive female vocals with strings and sounds pretty bland.  Reminds me of the first half of the Pat Garrett & Billy the Kid soundtrack.  \\"Alberta #1\\" is bland, straight forward, bluesy and features no creative arrangements whatsoever.  \\"I Forget More Than You Will Ever Know\\" reminds me of your typical slow-paced religious country yuckage that artists such as Charlie Rich were doing at the time.  \\"Days of 49\\" is the best song here and definitely fits in with the mid 60's lyrical style that Dylan was so darn incredible at, and maybe I'm crazy but the verse melody reminds me of Neil Young's \\"Running Dry (Requiem for the Rockets)\\" but played in a rockabilly style.<br /><br />\\"Early Morning Rain\\" is a slow-moving country ballad that's not quite good enough by Nashville Skyline's standards, which probably explains why it's here instead.  The piano is pretty and that's the only compliment I can say about it.  Despite all the people that believe it's a highlight, I fail to see why.  \\"In Search of Little Sadie\\" has Tom Petty-like vocals and... I can't even identify what genre this is supposed to fall under.  It morphs into blues around the 1:20 mark but before that?  What IS that?  Really cool vocals though- hey, I'm the first in line for uniqueness so no matter how it's expressed!  \\"Let It Be Me\\" is generic balladry junk.  At attempt at soul perhaps but doesn't work.\\"Little Sadie\\" is an improvement since it's a fast-moving country rocker.  Sort of filler-ish and too short, though.  \\"Woogie Boogie\\" is the *definition* of filler- a generic blues riff sets the pace for a boring instrumental, and the sax solo at the end is completely unnecessary.  \\"Belle Isle\\" is another country ballad with pointless orchestration that just increases the unnecessary amount of sappiness.<br /><br />\\"Living the Blues\\" is more short country blues.  Probably the best song on side two since at LEAST the vocals are decent.  Side two has made it perfectly clear that it doesn't have a reason to exist because this selection of songs is just really mediocre.  This version of \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\" is live and of course doesn't even try to stand in the same league as the Highway 61 Revisited version thanks to the rushed, less than stellar vocal performance taking place.  Again, don't even THINK about comparing this to the superior Highway 61 Revisited version.  \\"Copper Kettle\\" is gently sung filler material with delicate female vocals in the background.  It's unmelodic too.  \\"Gotta Travel On\\" (yes, PLEASE Dylan, travel on to bigger and better places!) is a decent country song and not much different from the Allman Brothers Band classic \\"Melissa\\" (at least the two songs sound alike during the verse melody).<br /><br />Now arrives MORE questionable material.  \\"Blue Moon\\" is at least alright because Dylan puts his own unique spin on a familiar doo-wop classic (unintentionally perhaps, since the only unique thing about it is his voice).  It's slow-paced and forgettable though.  I DO love the violin at the end and how it plays the verse melody for a few seconds.  Pretty cool moment that is.  \\"The Boxer\\" is a good song that actually captures the spirit of Simon & Garfunkel's \\"The Boxer\\" but unfortunately doesn't extend the \\"la la la\\" chorus at the end so there's no emotionally devastating build-up in this version.  That's one of the reasons I think so highly of the Simon & Garfunkel version.  \\"The Mighty Quinn\\" has now been turned into a piano-rockabilly version of a classic Manfred Mann song.  Vocals sound a bit off to me.  Not just anyone can sing this particular vocal melody and Dylan obviously can't.<br /><br />\\"Take Me As I Am (Or Let Me Go)\\" is another country ballad.  Can't get into it at all.  Honestly with all the country ballads scattered throughout Self Portrait, putting a really average one like this near the end is just insulting to the fans.  \\"Take a Message to Mary\\" surprisingly has a VERY good melody that's basically a perfect pop song at its core.  \\"It Hurts Me To\\" is acoustic country that's actually pretty good.  I can't say I appreciate Dylan's country/gospel/blues on most of Self Portrait but he surprises me here.  \\"Minstrel Boy\\" has an intro where the vocals are completetely out of tune!  Uh oh... that intro serves as the chorus.  Yikes.  The chorus is honestly nothing but barely adequate drunken nonsense with a distinct lack of foresight.  We shouldn't have to hear this kind of mediocre garbage, Bob!  \\"She Belongs to Me\\" is an average version of a classic.  \\"Wigwam\\" has humming serving as the verse melody and Spanish horns in the background, but this other version I've heard with high-pitched orchestrated female vocals is better.  I actually love this song but the million does question is this REALLY want you want from Bob Dylan?  \\"Alberta #2\\" is a beautiful ballad that does a fitting job (or a tricky job, hehe) of ending a below average album.  It's highly melodic and the piano arrangements are organized tastefully.<br /><br />Overall, well the truth is, the country songs feel like leftovers from the MUCH better Nashville Skyline album, and there's lot of other mediocre songs tossed in for additional disappointment.  Only for the biggest of Dylan fans.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I like this game because you can decorate and buy cool creatures.  I think there's a new ice age movie coming out too.  Fun Game ! Try it (:
B001U3Y5XE|5.0|If you love lego's and building, you'll love this game :)It's a little spendy, but well worth the money. Not recommended for little kids. Small pieces.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I just finished this book after a student recommended it to me. He was so enthusiastic about it, I had to give it a try. Since I am an English teacher and have read nothing else by the author, I wasn't expecting \\"great literature,\\" but a satisfying, easy read along the lines of The Hunger Games (which I loved, but it's not literary genius or anything).  I say without hesitation that this book is a masterpiece that ranks right up there with Catcher in the Rye.  I was stunned at every turn in this book. There were so many opportunities for this author to take clichéd, easy roads, but he just never did.  The voices of the characters and the supporting characters were just brilliant. This book contains some of the best lines about life and death I've ever read while still maintaining the believable voice of a teenager.  I cannot say enough about how stunned I am about the brilliance of this author. I don't even want to read another book for a while! I know it would be disappointing!
B000I8H7RI|3.0|I love this movie. The odd thing is that a part I remember seeing in the theaters is not there. When the children leave the schoolhouse there is a very tense part where they walk quietly by the birds, who become more and more menacing, and then attack. It is one of the best scenes in the movie. Strangely enough, it skips that entire part and just starts with the kids running. If I am misremembering, please let me know, but I am pretty sure this is not the way this scene originally played out.
B0018QQQK8|3.0|I should have known what I was getting myself into.<br /><br />Okay... Let me begin with some positives so I can avoid being hunted down and beaten by the army of Nicholas Sparks fans.<br /><br />Sparks is an excellent storyteller and a master of the romantic motif. He is good at taking a timeless story element and putting a new spin on it. He is also good with pacing, using smooth and lyrical words during romantic moments and quick and terse words in the more suspenseful moments.<br /><br />However...<br /><br />There are few things more irritating than a writer who feels the need to explain everything to his reader. Sparks does this often, in all of his books. It is as if Sparks caters to a demographic of readers who do not want to think and just want to enjoy a book. I get that, but there are also those (a lot) of us out there who don't enjoy a book if it doesn't make us think. I know what an IED is. And if I didn't know, I would find out. In one scene, a group of college kids make a joke about crabs. I chuckled, until I read the next line in which Sparks explains the joke! This, in my opinion, is inexcusable.<br /><br />In addition to that, I have a serious problem with some character point-of-view issues in this book. Sparks names each chapter after the character whose third-person point of view he follows in that chapter. This is an admirable and challenging method. But he breaks it several times throughout the book in order to (once again) explain something that the character may not know.<br /><br />Oh, and there should be a law that romance writers are no longer allowed to say that a character \\"completes\\" another character. Overdone, overused, and it lacks originality.<br /><br />There also were very few surprises in this book. I won't say too much, because some readers may be surprised by some things. But I was not.<br /><br />The book gets three stars, however, because I did enjoy the story. Also, Logan Thibault was a likeable character, not too romantic-lead cliche, and had some depth. Nana was funny, lovable, and provided some solid heart for all of the characters. The rest of the characters, however, seemed straight out of the book of character cliches (strong, determined female lead, controlling ex-husband, conflicted child divorce victim).<br /><br />It may be a while before I read another Nicholas Sparks book. Maybe one day when I just want to read a good story with predictable characters, no surprises, and that makes me say, \\"Gee, that was nice\\" but probably won't stick with me long after I've finished it.lead cliche, and had some depth.

B001U3Y5XE|5.0|My ten-year old son just received his Lego Creationary game as a reward for consistently doing his chores and studies. In less than 20 minutes, he has built 9 different things on the cards and is working on his 10th item. I dare say that he could likely play the game with a 2 minute time limit on the building of many of the items. I was able to easily determine what each item was after he built it. This game is great!<br /><br />As for the negative reviews, I can only say that your kids were likely a poor match for this game.

It was a bit slow. She does get a little like \\"he's the only thing in my life!The only thing worth living for!\\"... and she still has loads of important people alive in her life.

0756407125|4.0|I agree with many of the other reviewers that the first book was better.  But, I am not sure how good this book is until I read book three.  So I gave it a four on spec. because It is a book I will read over and over.<br />My biggest complaint is how long it takes for the books to come out.  My daughter once told me that she never reads a series that isn't already completed.  I almost wish I had taken her advice.  As it is, I will have to read the first two books again when the third one comes out to refresh my memory after so long.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|I was sorely disappointed with this final installment. I felt like there was another author writing this last book altogether because it strayed so far away from the first two books. The ending left much to be desired as well. Even with the epilogue's attempt to fill in the blanks I was still left questioning \\"How did they get here?\\" It was just all wrong and not because it didn't end the way that I thought it should but I just didn't feel that it stayed true to the character's relationships and personalities.

B007L3BMGA|1.0|It seems to me that not many women (or men) have read a decent romance or erotic novel before.  Just because this made the NY Times list does not make it good. It is great that a book has made romance/ erotica more mainstream to read and talk to your friends about; but a shame that is was not one of better quality and storyline. It is poorly written and disappointing.I wanted to like it and I was excited that this was a series - as I LOVE reading series romance/ erotic stories.  I couldn't finish the first story.  What a waste of $10.  Don't do it.  There are so many far better stories out there.  It is not worth your time or your money.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I have been a fantasy buff from my school days. I started it out with Tolkien, when I was 12. I had them all: Michael Morcook´s Elric, Howard´s Conan, Dragonriders of Pern, Poul Anderson, Robert Jordan, Later: Terry Goodkind etc. pp.<br /><br />But at one stage it just became boring, repetitive. The Arch-Evil, the sorceresses, yet another more powerfull \\"boss-enemy\\" (as they call it today in the computer game generation). It was just questing and questing and hack and slay.<br /><br />What was consistently blatantly missing was depth of character development, the inner, mental side of it. The iconographic LOTR by Tolkien is a perfect example: All characters are 2-D, shallow, boring, none has doubts, real fears, inner struggles, and if, they are depicted on a childish level.<br /><br />And, as I grew older, what was bltatantly missing beyond your run of the mill-Conan-like rape, was adult content. Sex. Always chaste, prudish - or just missing.<br /><br />And then I stumbled into news about George R.R. Martin´s \\"Game of Thrones\\"-HBO serial.<br /><br />I watched a bit - and it made me curious.<br /><br />I bought the Ebooks for my new IPad.<br /><br />And what shall I say:<br /><br />I am bewitched! It´s all there! A multi-faceted character-oriented psychological side to it. Believable likes and dislikes this side of the Arch-Devil-rubbish.<br /><br />And more adult content than some might care to stomach - at least in the ultra-prudish US of A.<br /><br />For me it´s a clear five thumbs up! A real page-turner, in which you can sink and forget time.<br /><br />What more do you want from Fiction?
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I saw this book discussed on several tv shows and thought I would try it.  It is the worst piece of trash I have read in a very long time.  This author evidently doesn't know anything but erotic sex.  That is all the book was about.  Way too much.  I think there was a good story line there  -  she just didn't write it.  I am sorry I wasted my money on this book.

1610660242|5.0|I loved this book and the down to earth(ness) that I feel while listening to Tony. Judging by many of the reviews I read on here that are a lot of people who just want to wake up and be miserable each day. I've always been fascinated by anyone who was obsessed with customer service. Although, I've never ordered anything from Zappos I've heard about how wonderful they were at customer service even before reading the book. It was great to get a peek behind the curtains. I am also delighted to learn that there are companies out there that care more about people than profits. Many people that read this book still don't get what creating and sustaining culture is all about.  With so many business out there today that could easily hang \\"Customer No Service\\" on their entry door it was quite refreshing to see a company...a brand who made their #1 goal to be WOW their customers.  Not one person who gave this book less than 5 stars could take what Tony says in the book and apply it in their personal or professional life and not emerge better off than they were before. Many people want to criticize the writing (which I had no problem with at all) so they can continue on in life being just mediocre. I like Tony's realness, his transparency and him being himself instead of trying to come off as something he's not. There are so many plastic people in this world that it's quite refreshing to see someone like Tony who is willing to remove his mask. I certainly hope more businesses and entrepreneurs alike begin to embrace happiness and superior customer service because I think it would just make this world a better place to wake up to.

0060775858|5.0|This book is so beautifully done. It's so simple to read with simple soft soothing pictures to look at. I think the pictures pull you into the that world. It's also a soothing soft read too. The words put you into a quite calm mood. I have read this to my children every night and it was a book I enjoyed as much as the kids, so I didn't mind reading every night. My daughter requested it for her daughter, which is why I just bought it again. Sometimes less is more, and this is certainly true this with book. A must if you have children around.

0143121006|4.0|Pamela Werner - vivacious only daughter of a retired British civil servant and sinophile academic - is found brutally murdered.  The colonial administration in charge at the time insists that British detectives lead the investigation. Capable local Chinese detective Colonel Han is pushed aside in favour of Chief Inspector Dennis from neighbouring Tientsin. This swiftly becomes a fatal flaw in the investigation as Colonel Han's local expertise and contacts are ignored and corruption and incompetence take over.<br /><br />The tragic tale is simply told in a straightforward manner. The period is evocatively realized and the narrow and dimly lit hutongs and gaudy unpoliced Badlands - home to pimps, prostitutes, drug addicts and other lowlife - as well as thrill-seeking expatriates - are readily visualized in the imagination through French's competent writing.<br /><br />The hero of the book, if there can be one in such a tragic story, is Pamela's father.  Denied justice by the colonial administration, he spends his time and savings hiring private detectives and agents to pursue what little evidence remains.  One can only imagine the horror as Edward Werner is forced to confront the killer regularly on the streets of Peking as the conclusive evidence to arrest him never materializes.  Edward and his daughter's killer are even interned together by the Japanese as they tighten their grip on the city.<br /><br />I met author Paul French at the launch of the paperback version in Hong Kong in September 2011 - so I am astonished it has taken so long to be released in the US.  French said he wanted the book to be an investigation of a crime and its aftermath in the same vein as Truman Capote's \\"In Cold Blood\\". As French's agent is said to have reminded him \\"You're no Truman Capote\\".  He was right. The book has its rough edges but the story and investigation are truly compelling. However, French can be satisfied in almost certainly identifying the real killer.  The only drawbackto this fascinating book is the lack of information on what became of the principal characters, especially the murder suspect.

0718157834|5.0|This is not a book to read many reviews of before reading. It is very hard to even say what it is about without giving too much away. I almost didn't read it because I thought I had figured out what kind of book it was and I generally don't read those kind of books, but something drew me to it anyway.<br />It is essentially a story about two people who meet and get to know each other under unusual circumstances, about how they improve and change each others lives and of how their friendship plays out.<br /><br />It wasn't quite what I was expecting but in a good way, it was light hearted in places ( laugh out loud light)  but not light in subject matter. Beautifully written with depth and heart.<br />I wanted to read it all the time but at the same time I didn't want to move on too fast, both because I enjoyed the world created by the author and didnt want to leave it, and because I had a feeling I wasn't going to like the ending and didn't want to face it.<br />It doesn't seem to be available in the US yet but I bought it last week in the UK. I hope it is released here soon
B0000256KE|5.0|'Roxy Music's' second album was proof that this band was no novelty act! There really isn't a bad track on \\"For Your Pleasure\\". I especially love \\"Do the Strand\\", \\"Strictly Confidential\\", \\"Editions of You\\", \\"In Every Dream Home a Heartache\\" (with a great solo by Phil), \\"The Bogus Man\\", and of course the great title track of \\"For Your Pleasure\\". Their early albums only get better with the test of time. Has anyone ever noticed a similarity between the music of \\"The Rocky Horror Picture Show\\" (which made its London stage debut in June of '73), and Roxy's first two albums? Richard O'Brien even bears a close resemblance to Brian Eno. Not that it matters, Roxy Music and the Rocky Horror have both stood the test of time!<br /><br />Love and Peace,<br />Carlos Romero
0061726834|3.0|A YA dystopian tale, this time the society is a world where love has been declared a disease. The cause of global disasters and personal tradgedies. At age 18 everyone gets either cured or innoculated, depending whether they have been \\" infected\\" or not. The result is the same because the cure is some form of lobotomy.<br />Lena can't wait for the cure and is counting the days, 94 to go. Then, oops!  she meets a boy, Alex, and gradually becomes \\"infected\\" and decides maybe the cure isn't such a great idea after all. Now Alex and Lena have to find a way to escape from the cure, are hunted down and have to find a way to escape their society and be together.<br />I thought this was pretty good but didn't love it enough to keep going to bed early to read it in peace like my son did. For me it seemed to take a long time to get started. I was 50% through before I felt truly interested in the characters. Up to that point I persevered on the strength of my sons recommendation and Lauren Oliver's writing.<br />It was so obviously a part 1 and ended with a huge cliff hanger which was irritating to me. Can't anyone write complete stories any more? Is a beginning, a middle, and an end in one volume too much to ask.? it seems to be.  I liked it enough to read the next installment but I'm going to wait til book three is also available.<br />I gave it three stars but its more like a 3 1/2<br /><br />Most 12 and ups would like it. I would have thought it would appeal to girls more than boys but my 13 1/2 yr old son liked it very much so what do I know?
B00782O7IY|4.0|It has been argued that art benefits from limits. Sonnets must have 14 lines and adhere to structures of rhyme and meter. Great artists don't say, \\"I can't work with those rules\\" but take up the challenge. Shakespeare wrote 154 sonnets, not including those in his plays.<br /><br />Some limitations of art can be attributed to choice and some are imposed by circumstances. The producer Val Lewton made low budget horror films in the 1940s. He didn't have the money for elaborate special effects for films like \\"Cat People\\" or \\"The Seventh Victim\\" so he had to use shadow and impressions to scare the audience. And arguably his films where the frights took place in the minds of the audience better than some films of the period that now seem dated by laughable creature effects.<br /><br />The Production Code of the Hayes Office limited what could be openly shown and talked about in mainstream Hollywood films. And though I'm not an advocate for censorship, such films as \\"Casablanca\\" and \\"Notorious\\" are much more subtle and even adult in dealing with issues of sexuality than most modern films that are free to show more body parts.<br /><br />Michel Hazanavicius, the French writer and director, of last year's acclaimed film, \\"The Artist\\", imposed upon himself several rather daunting limits. Set in Hollywood from 1927 - 32, the film, like those of the silent era has no spoken dialogue (mostly), is black and white and uses screen proportions of those years in film. Interestingly, it also complies with the content restrictions of the era (mostly; with the exception of a rude hand gesture and an implied act of violence that might not have made it to the screen at that time.)<br /><br />Jean Duardin plays a swashbuckling star of the silver screen (think Fairbank/Valentino) named George Valentin at the peak of his career who meets a young starlet on the rise (Peppy Miller played by Berenice Bejo). The advent of sound proves devastating to his career as it was for many silent stars.<br /><br />Ultimately, \\"The Artist\\" is a story about pride; a man too proud to accept help when it is needed, even to accept love.<br /><br />When his studio switches to making \\"talkies\\" exclusively, Valentin uses his own money to make an elaborate silent film that, along with the market crash, leads to his financial downfall.<br /><br />He turns out his faithful servant who desires to still serve and resists help from Peppy who desires to return the favors he granted her.<br />As Proverbs 29:23 teaches, \\"Pride brings a person low.\\" The question in the film is whether Valentin will fulfill the second part of that verse, \\"but the lowly in spirit will gain honor.\\"<br /><br />Hazanavicius playfully uses the conceits of the silent film, the facial mugging and exaggerated gestures to kid, but not mock the films of that period.

B002HFJ77S|4.0|Ive decide I like it when a book makes me laugh. I chuckled quite a few times through this one. Good escapist stuff. Very entertaining.<br />A fun read
B0067EKY7M|3.0|The best thing about the film, \\"Salmon Fishing in the Yemen\\", is the imagery found in the title. The audacious idea of bringing a fishing industry to the desert evokes glorious ideas of rebirth and resurrection. But unfortunately, the soaring nature of this central theme is dragged down by dull, loathsome Hollywood clich&eacute;s.<br /><br /> Certainly, the film has an interesting pedigree. Directed by Lasse Hallstrom (who made one of the greatest of all coming of age films, \\"My Life as a Dog\\") and screenplay by Simon Beaufoy (who brings the work of a novelist to the screen as he did with \\"Slumdog Millionaire\\") gave reason for hope.<br /><br /> Ewan McGregor plays Dr. Alfred Jones. (Sidenote - I kept being distracted when people called him Dr. Jones which made me think of another famous movie scientist. Between this and playing Obi-Wan in the prequels, is he trying to redo all of George Lucas' classic characters? Howard the Duck can't be far behind. End sidenote.) Dr. Jones is an ichthyologist / British government drone challenged to help a sheik bring salmon to Yemen.<br /><br /> Emily Blunt plays Harriet, a western representative for the sheik who must persuade Jones that the project is not a boondoggle or a joke but a viable possibility. Pressure is also supplied by Kristen Scott Thomas who plays the Prime Minister's Press Secretary desperately seeking a positive story from the Middle East.<br /><br /> Thomas as the foul mouthed, devious political schemer provides some of the film's funniest moments, especially in her texting conversations with the Prime Minister, but at times her moments come across as \\"In the Loop\\" lite.<br /><br /> Another fine moment in the film comes when Jones meets with the sheik who ask if Jones is religious. Jones insists he just believes in facts and figures...He's a scientist! But the sheik counters that Jones is a fisherman and by definition that means he is a man of faith. Why else would he spend hundreds of hours waist deep in water with no assured outcome.<br /><br /> There are several interesting conversations about religion. Alfred and Harriet both admit they don't know anyone who goes to church, Alfred saying he uses Sundays to go to Target. (This is a little puzzling as before we saw Alfred with his wife practicing in a musical quartet in a church. Whatever.)<br /><br /> But as I mentioned before, tiresome clich&eacute;s emerge and to discuss them I must stoop to spoilers.<br /><br /> Though is it a spoiler to say that even though Jones is a married man and Harriet is in an affair with a soldier in Afghanistan, that the two will fall and love? For a while I thought that the message of the importance of patience and faith and fishing would be applied to the marriage of Dr. Jones. But no, because I more important rule is that in a Hollywood film the two names at the top of the bill, the pretty people, must come together. \\"Casablanca\\" is still fresh because lead characters doing what is right rather than what feels good is a rarity in films.<br /><br /> There also is lazy characterization in the film. When Blunt's boyfriend becomes inconvenient to the plot, he is shown to be a raciest, as all soldiers seem to be in Hollywood. And the sheik, we are assured, is different, a visionary who believes in peace, romance and fishing. There is talk of the clich&eacute; of \\"the magic negro\\", an African American figure whose sole purpose is to supply wisdom to the white hero. Amr Waked seems to be playing the Arab version of this role (as he did in \\"Syriana\\"). All the other Arabs seem shady and are probably all terrorists.<br /><br /> And the final annoying clich&eacute;, was the talk of \\"faith\\". In films, it is important to have faith, it doesn't matter what you put your faith in. So it's good for Alfred to put faith in something new and different like a fish hatchery in the desert and a romantic fling, but nothing so drab as an established marriage.<br /><br /> But it does, of course, matter what youput your faith in. The film has people who engage in terrorism and they certainly have faith, placed in a wrong and evil place.<br /><br /> Paul in I Corinthians 15 argues that if Christians put their faith in the resurrection and it proves untrue, then Christians are fools.<br /><br /> So faith in fishing in the Yemen, in peace and prosperity in the Middle East needs to be more than just a pretty thought one believes in, it must be possible. I wish those ideas would have been even more central in the film than another tired boy meets girl story.<br /><br />(The film is rated PG-13 for brief violence and strong language.)ilm has people who engage in terrorism and they certainly have faith, placed in a wrong and evil place.<br /><br /> Paul in I Corinthians 15 argues that if Christians put their faith in the resurrection and it proves untrue, then Christians are fools.<br /><br /> So faith in fishing in the Yemen, in peace and prosperity in the Middle East needs to be more than just a pretty thought one believes in, it must be possible.

B004X6PRO6|4.0|With its varying narrators , shifting tenses and non linear timeline this wasn't the easiest read. Not having visited North Korea i cant say for sure but it seems to me that Adam Johnson did a good job of depicting life there. I felt chilled and disorientated many times. It was a compelling but nightmarish read. I'm glad to leave that world.
B005LAIIRQ|4.0|I hope this doesn't come as too big of a shock to you: but you're dying. Oh, it probably will take years and I certainly hope for most of us we're talking a multitude of decades. But I can only think of two people who avoided death (they're in the Bible and their names start with `E', you can look it up) and the odds are against us joining that exclusive club.<br /><br />The Grey is a film about a group of men that are facing death, likely to be sooner rather than later. A group of roughneck oil men survive a plane crash in the Alaskan wilderness but death in the form of starvation, exposure, wolf attack (you read that right) or a number of other unexpected and unpleasant possibilities seems imminent. (There's a reason the phrase \\"Feel Good Movie of the Year\\" doesn't appear on the film's lobby posters.)<br /><br />When we first meet the character played by Liam Neeson, Ottway, he is contemplating suicide for reasons that are not initially revealed. But instead he boards the doomed flight and soon finds himself fighting for his life.<br /><br />In these dire circumstances, the men must deal with the essential choices of fear and faith. One character in the film, Diaz (Frank Grillo), claims to have neither faith nor fear. Ottman calls him a fool for not being afraid in such a time, arguing it is idiocy to be fearless. Another character, Talget (Dermot Mulroney) calls him a fool for not having faith in God and a life to come.<br /><br />So is fear or fearlessness foolish? (Sorry about the excessive alliteration.) Ottman makes a very persuasive argument that fear is the most rational response to certain situations. But toward the end of the film, Ottman receives powerful arguments against fear from a couple of unexpected sources. The film seems to argue that fear is understandable, perhaps even unavoidable, (director Joe Carnahan certainly give the audience some scares), but something that must be overcome.<br /><br />For Christians, Scripture also seems to provide a schizophrenic view of fear. Proverbs 9:10 says that \\"Fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.\\" Jesus argues (in Luke 12:5) for the good sense in fearing God. But note that it's just the beginning. The most common command in Scripture, spoken by angels and Jesus Himself is, \\"Don't be afraid.\\" I John 4:18 says that \\"Love drives out fear.\\"<br /><br />The Bible seems to say that fear can be a good start for assessing our situation without God's love and forgiveness. But it has no place in our lives once we have placed our faith in God's goodness. But many of the characters in \\"The Grey\\" don't believe in God, let alone a God of Mercy. They've lived brutal lives and are facing the possibility of a brutal death. Where is God in that?<br /><br />In fact, one of the characters calls out to God to show Himself (in a scene reminiscent of the cries of Job in Scripture, just much more profanity filled) and God seems to be silent.<br /><br />But is God ever fully silent?<br /><br />In Romans 1:20, the apostle Paul argues, \\"For since the creation of the world God's invisible qualities--his eternal power and divine nature--have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, so that people are without excuse.\\"<br /><br />The film doesn't scrimp on showing the brutality of our fallen world. But we also see much of the beauty of God's creation, not just in the majestic landscapes of the Alaskan wilderness, but also in acts of kindness and bravery from the most unlikely of human sources. Faith in God is essential to live. But it is even, perhaps, more essential for death.<br /><br />(2012's \\"The Grey\\" is quite justifiably rated R for brutal violence and language, but not for the occasionally awkward computer generated wolf images.

B007J4T2G8|3.0|I really enjoyed this book but I must say all the 'press' and discussion of it gives it much more credit than it is due.  It is a good book but not an excellent book and the characters are enjoyable in ONE book but if you decided to read the other two...well don't.
0385534639|1.0|I read the hype about this book and have had it on reserve at the local library for weeks.  Imagine my excitement when I got the call that the book was ready for me to pick up!  That was about as excited as I got about this book.  I don't understand the hype.  It is a love story.  It talks about a \\"magical\\" circus.  But I agree with another one of the reviewers who says that the structure is just not all that.  I struggled to finish this book.  I even read two books while wrestling with this one.  I'd read a couple of chapters and then close the book, trying to figure out what I had just read and what it had to do with any type of storyline.  If they do make a movie of the book, I would go see it.  Maybe it would help my appreciation - I can't see how it can get any worse.  Maybe this will be the sole case of the movie being better than the book.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|I found the first book enjoyable but this book was flat and a chore to complete.  The first book should have been left to stand alone as the author didn't seem to have enough skill to maintain the story longer. The erotica seemed cut and paste from the first book and the character development fell very flat.
B005FISC52|5.0|I have been an avid fan of One Tree Hill for the last four years and this final season was the absolute best ever.  Writer Mark S. brilliantly brought each personality and relationship to a close.  I have thoroughly enjoyed the series and watching the characters mature.  I loved Peyton and Lucas but I was not surprised that Nathan and Haley & Brooke and Julian were able to keep the sizzle and series ratings going.  Thanks for an excellent series.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|This book was horrid and was a pain to read. The author did a great job on the first book but the second and third fell short.  The plot was weak, the erotica wasn't erotic at all just a rinse/repeat from the other books and the characters were flat and lifeless.

0307949508|5.0|I heard from many people that this series was fantastic, and that this book was the best one in the series.  I'm in the middle of the [[ASIN:0307454568 The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest: Book 3 of the Millennium Trilogy (Vintage Crime/Black Lizard)]] right now, but so far--The Girl Who Played with Fire is the best and it really is awesome!  I was really surprised at the execution of the story.  Like the first one, it was very different than what I expected--but very very good.  Highly recommended!
B007BVOF8E|2.0|i should have rented this movie from a colored box instead of putting out money to buy it..... not that great a movie
B0078YWDHO|3.0|The movie was ok, maybe because we rented a HD version and the picture quality was terrible, not sure why. I would not buy this movie, Depp has done better for sure.
B005S9EK1S|5.0|okay, I will be truthful, I haven't finished reading the book, but I absolutely loved the movie! I didn't think Dear John was as good--that one was too sad. This movie is beautiful, and Zac Efron does a superb job at playing the role of Thibault. I was glued to the whole movie, and you know what? If you don't like romantic movies, then it's NOT for you. But this movie was not just about romance-- it was about receiving love, deserving love, and the power of angels to help someone have a chance after going through challenges being off at war. If you don't like this movie, well you're missing out! And you don't know what true love is! It made me like Zac Efron even more because it goes to show that he can play any kind of role from dancing musicals to romantic dramas :) If you liked other Nicholas Sparks movies, you will love this one though! I want to be the very first person to buy this movie! and I think I was - it comes out Aug. 28th :)  so excited to get my copy!!

B001W79MB8|5.0|A Nameless ronin, a dog, a a precotious kid. These are the protagonists of &#34;Sword of the Stranger&#34; an epic return to what I love about samurai anime. Great coreography, cool villains, and an interesting story keep the pace of this film moving even when it lags a bit. Thanks to great chracterization this movie really keeps you invested in all invloved, and the action when it comes is very intense. I had heard about this movie a while ago, and now I wish I had gotten it way back then. This is worth every penny.

B007CKNX28|5.0|The term genius has been used for Jack, but I don't know of any artists who create a calculative goal and build towards it, like they are solving a puzzle.  No, I think the best music is NOT genius, but passion.  Passion is the key for art of any form, and it is clear that Jack is overflowing with passion for this collection of songs.  Passion is opening yourself up and not only letting you look inside, but letting you poke around a little.<br />I personally find this music beautiful.  I preordered it, so it was on my iPhone when I woke up. It was a lovely surprise this morning, and I'm glad to pay for it, support Jack and his efforts, and poke around in his soul as he has opened it up to we lucky listeners.<br />If I were a person who voted on such things, this would be my pick for album of the year, thus far.  I can not praise this enough.<br />Thank you Jack for this beautiful album of music.
B004EPYZUS|5.0|Awesome movie! Action-packed just the way Mission Imposible movies should be, some great humor, great cast! The best of the series so far, I think. Thoroughly enjoyed this movie!

Then one day I was really bored and I decided to try.  I couldn't put it down!  I read the first book in a single day, and went on to read the next two in under a week.  LOVED the story, the characters, and the suspense.  Great read!!!

B0068RHGJM|1.0|What a pile of self indulgent drivel. I listened to this swill twice and was so disgusted that I fed the disc to the shredder. How the mighty have fallen!<br /><br />In a previous review (of Century Child) I noted how Nightwish had clearly evolved from their early efforts and really locked their songwriting and performance together. But by DPP you could see the cracks in the Nighwish onslaught, and here with Imaginaerum, you can really see how they've just run out of ideas. Ripping off Blackmore's Night? 13:29 of babble? Yeah, I won't be buying any Nightwish concert tickets this tour.<br /><br />It's clear that Toumas believes his own press about his musical genius and no one in the Nightwish camp (pun intended) had the chutzpah to call shenanigans. I've seen this sort of thing before. It's reminiscent of Styx wandering down the dark and vapid paths toward show-tune hell as they fell from the heights of filling arenas to a caricature that doesn't even rate a \\"where are they now?\\" episode. Nightwish is eagerly following down that path - they can no longer produce the real thing and now they've given over to musical self gratification. Song of Myself indeed.

B005HJWWW8|5.0|I previously bought a Fiio E3 to enhance sound from my MP3 player while motorcycle riding. It's pretty good for the money, but it's also a one-trick pony. Either on or off - no other options.<br /><br />The E6 is a much more versatile device. It turns on/off via a switch, rather than only by plugging/unplugging your earphones. It has 3 preset EQ settings, which give varying bass, treble or midrange boosts. And it has a volume control. The E3 is useful in boosting bass response if your MP3 player is rather flat sounding - or in boosting volume if your MP3 player just doesn't have enough oomph.<br /><br />Today, I gave the E6 a good workout on a 100-mile ride. Results were positive.<br /><br />First and foremost, it fattened up the sound nicely. The MP3 player built into my Garmin GPS is good, but has no tone controls; sound is very flat and thin. The E6 nicely beefs up the bass. Actually,I tested by riding 50 miles each with two different headphones. The Sonys benefited from additional bottom end and a little volume boost, and the Sennheisers worked well with a middle setting that helped midrange.<br /><br />Second, the E6 definitely provides a solid volume boost, plenty enough to get the volume uncomfortably high if I so desired. Which I didn't; I had to back the volume off quite a bit with the Sennheiser headphones. More important, there was plenty enough volume to listen to a Beethoven concerto at 70mph,so my traveling music no longer has to be restricted to the loudest classic rock albums I can find.<br /><br />Finally, the E6 is surprisingly quiet. In other words, very little hum. The E3 is electronically very noisy. While there is a slight hum from the E6, it isn't noticeable once the music gets going - and certainly not over ambient 70mph bike noise.<br /><br />Also, size matters - or lack of size in this case. Looking at the picture, you might think the Fiio E6 is the size of an IPod. Not so. It is actually about an inch square, 1/4 inch thick, and weighs practically nothing. So whether you keep it stuffed in your pocket or hanging from a tank bag, it isn't bothersome.<br /><br />At about $27 and for my needs, the Fiio E6 is a good buy.

1416972242|4.0|All right people... I thought I could stop after City of Bones, but quite obviously you see that I could not. After finishing City of Bones for the second time, I figured I might as well read the rest of the books in the series as City of Lost Souls comes out in roughly a week. I got through City of Ashes much faster than City of Bones and so hopefully my quick reading streak continues and I can finish City of Glass and City of Angels before May 8th. Now, I'm going to write this as spoiler free as humanly possible, so feel safe in reading my review if you are new to The Mortal Instruments series!<br /><br />City of Ashes takes off right where City of Bones leaves us... some big stuff happens... people change...there's fighting? How can I even begin to describe this book without any spoilers? Well, here goes! Valentine is still bad, very bad. Clary and Jace learn some pretty interesting things about their heritage...think Starwars. Simon and Alec discover whole new lifestyles, and it's definitely not what you think. In this second installment, Clary and the gang must work even harder to overcome not only the bumps that Valentine puts in the road, but they must also overcome a few personal obstacles before they can hope to beat Valentine.<br /><br />In book two, Clare introduces us to her brand of writing where everyone has a part. We've got vampires, werewolves, some man on man love, warlocks, demons, Shadowhunters, Faeries and more. It seems that Cassandra Clare's invisible world is a world just like our own. One full of not only prejudiced people, but all kinds of people. It's not often we see young adult fiction featuring homosexuality, especially in a book series as widely popular as The Mortal Instruments. This is a huge reason for my love of Clare's books: she writes for everyone. Instead of devastatingly beautiful princesses falling in love with dashingly charming princes living happily ever after, Clare's characters are ordinary. Ordinary you ask? Didn't your list above include supernatural demon hunters descended from Angels? Her characters are ordinary in that they have real problems. Simon is in love with his best friend who won't return his love. Clary, while pretty in her own right, is described as an awkward ginger who is short and gangly. We have Shadowhunters finding out how to express to their friends and family that they are gay, in a world where being a warrior and being gay never go hand in hand. The characters go through they own struggles while still saving the day and that is a huge reason why these books as such a must read.<br /><br />The book as a whole sets a different mood from the first book. In City of Bones, we find ourselves dying for as much information as we can, learning about the invisible world in Clare's writing. In this book, we dive further and further into their world with Clary as she discovers more about herself in the mundane world and the Shadowhunter world. She becomes ever stronger as she learns of unrequited love, forbidden love and the love and bonds of a family. Clary grows up fast in these books and unlike many other stories, her growing pains are pains indeed. She comes to realize that life isn't easy, it's the difficult choies that you make that make you an adult, not the fact that you're glowingly happy all the time. Clary is definitely one of my favorites. Dare I say a close second to Hermione Granger... yep I said it.<br /><br />While there is still a lot of character development in this book, we find more in the plot department as well. We learn more of Valentine and his plans and also about the fate of the Clave and the Shadowhunter world. The action in this book is simply awesome as well. While these books do have a fair amount of blood and guts, it's not in excess and even the most squeamish reader will find themselves devouring page after page, yearning for more.<br /><br />What can I say? Each book gets  better and better!

B003ZSISGM|5.0|Fast paced and fun. Was definitely a worthwhile read.<br /><br />Without spoiling anything, just be aware that the book ends with a ton of loose ends that are only covered in the third book in the series.<br /><br />Also, the violence is occasionally a bit ridiculous and over the top.<br /><br />This is my favourite book in the series.
B00634GHJA|5.0|Wow, very easy to transfer pictures between my PC and Phone.  I was able to send photos to my girlfriend's iPhone without her installing anything, but the buttons didn't show up to upload photo/videos from her phone to mine like they did on the computer, -.5 stars if I could.  But all in all awesome app.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|The game is ssssooooo fun! You get to control what hapens. I was looking for something like this  that I saw on the iPad. I finally found it!!! Great game!
B004YF6MHW|3.0|If you're only getting this for the zoom, don't bother.  I have a Nexus X which doesn't have zoom, so I was hopping I could use this instead.  When you zoom in it still does normal focus and is very slow.  All it really does is crop the photo for you, the object I was trying to picture was still bury.  However, if you like the other features then it's worth it.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|I have this game on my phone and had to have it on my kindle fire.it is so much fun to pass the time!
B005GG0MIS|5.0|The Presidents Club is a must read for anyone that is truly interested in the fine line that exists with current Presidents and their successors.  It opens the chapters of history from a perspective that is seldom seen by the general public.<br /><br />Exciting -- The book is an easy read that keeps the reader engaged as the authors tell the narrative of Presidential interaction.  From Hoover to Obama the dynamics are shaped by the most powerful men in the world.  From ego's to self-empathy the authors tell the real life history of how the club has grown and shrunk over the last 50 years.<br /><br />Credible -  Well sourced and full of citing the authors took the job seriously and gave readers insights only found by scouring thousands and thousands of pages of Presidential material<br /><br />Insightful -  Discover how Hoover was a tremendous help at the end of WWII.  Put yourself in President Reagan's post-presidential office as he teaches another President how to salute.<br /><br />Perception Changing -  The book opened this readers eyes to the decisions that Presidents have to make.  Foreign Policy rules the land and I would bet each of us are hard pressed to ever look at our leaders through the same lens as we did before reading this book.
B00540G3G6|4.0|I am a huge fan of the Nightmare Before Christmas; however, the 3D effect was not much better than the conversion trick that my tv can do itself, which I think someone else has already said, but I concur. As far as the remastered movie goes, it looks great, I would highly recommend buying it on Blu-ray and you would still get all the special features and everything. At least as of now, I have never seen this 3D Combo-pack very cheap and the 3D just isn't worth it; the 3D is not as good as Lion King 3D, Tangled 3D, any of the Toy Story 3D conversions, or most of the other movies I've seen. Maybe on par with Beauty and the Beast 3D, if even.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|great game. love it. can not stop playing it. I am just trying to add words to get more words for this review.
B000NVIXFK|3.0|\\"Workin' Them Angels\\" and \\"Spindrift\\" are the only stand out tracks for me.  I like the other tracks, but Rush does not capture the magic on this studio album.  The live performance motivated me to buy this album.  I saw Rush for the first time on The Snakes & Arrows Tour.  And, I really enjoyed the tracks from this album that they played live that so much better live.  Unfortunately, the hooks don't seem materialize on the album.<br /><br />I hadn't heard this album prior to this concert.  I enjoy Rush's music, but I'm not a \\"fan\\"; I'm a casual appreciator. I only own Rush's \\"The Spirit of Radio\\" greatest hits album.  However, I have a number of friends who are big Rush fans, so I'm well versed in their work.  This album seems to affect me the same as some of their other work: some tracks come off as hokey or monotonous (in the technical sense).  These might be lyrical issues (e.g., \\"The Trees\\") or production issues.  For the later, I feel like some tracks are monotonous in the technical sense: However they decide to mix the song makes all of the instruments blend together in monotonously rather than symphonically.  I think it's this hit or miss nature of Rush, as far as my tastes are concerned, that keep me a casual appreciator.<br /><br />I do enjoy listening to this album, but not regularly; and I find it difficult to listen to the whole album at once.  I don't know if the tracks work together as a cohesive album.  Separately, many of the songs work, but the album lacks progression and connectivity as collective work.<br /><br />I haven't heard the two different live albums from the Snake & Arrows Tour.  If I listen to those, maybe I will have a different impression of this collection of songs.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I have enjoyed each and every page of this book. Such detail, I could really picture each moment as I was reading. I will read all 3 books for sure!!

B006R1T40I|5.0|I will confess, I have been a Bonnie Raitt fan since I was in college, which was a long time ago.  The first time I heard that soulful, knowing voice on our campus radio station I had to find out who this great singer was (and I was surprised to find out how young she was at the time.)  The albums she recorded for Warner Brothers in the 70s got a lot of play on my turntable.  I always loved the variety of material she was capable of doing so well.  Rock, soul, blues, folk, and more.  After having been a fan for so long and seeing so many of her live concerts, I was stunned and so pleased at her commercial (and artistic) success with \\"Nick Of Time\\" and the subsequent Capitol albums.  But the last few to me were a little formulaic and tired, even though she always sounded great.  With \\"Slipstream\\" Bonnie seems revitalized to these ears and I think it's her best in at least 15 years.  So many strong performances--\\"Used To Rule The World\\", \\"Million Miles\\", \\"Split Decision\\" and a few others hold their own against anything she's done.  Even the handful of \\"okay\\" songs are elevated by her commitment to the matieral.  One thing I can say about Bonnie, she rarely if ever phones it in.  When you compare this cd to the dreck that's out there these days it really makes you appreciate genuine talent and passion.  I give this one a VERY big thumbs up.  Keep it up, Bonnie!

B0071XO8RA|3.0|Dear Mr. Howey,<br /><br />Wool is startling, hyponotizing, and audacious. The layered plot, character development and world creation display the high quality of your writing skills. I even like the underlying moral that weaves throughout the story: we can't change what's gone before; we are responsible for what we do now. However, your world view leaves me cold.<br /><br />A sentence in the product description says, \\"But there are always those who hope, who dream.\\" I found no hope in Wool. Under the lies of the ruling elite, \\"life is hard and then you die.\\" What changes when the new leaders tell the truth? In the world you created, the truth changes nothing. Even with the lies exposed, \\"life is hard and then you die.\\" In fact with a logical extrapolation from the ground work you laid in the first five pieces, life could get significantly worse when the truth is told.<br /><br />I believe Wool, as a book and as a series, has the potential to sell well. In my opinion, however, it does not have the appeal to last, to be read, reread, and savored. Madelein l'Engle in Walking on Water expresses precisely what I believe to be missing in Wool. She states, \\"We don't want to feel less when we have finished reading a book; we want to feel that new possibilities of being have opened up to us. We don't want to close a book with a sense that life is totally unfair and that there is no light in the darkness; we want to feel that we have been given illumination.\\" Yet when I finished reading Wool, I felt the opposite of illuminated and enriched; I felt robbed of hope.<br /><br />I'm not asking for \\"happily ever after.\\" I ask simply that change do more than present a new version of the circumstances and that new version without hope of improvement.<br /><br />By-the-way, with my limited experience of a grain elevator (silo) in West Texas, I recall that the problem was not rotting grain. The problem was the high risk of a grain dust explosion killing everyone who worked there.

B004XANKVO|5.0|This is my second crossover Thule back pack. I purchased an identical back back pack in november 2011 through Apple. I use it all the time. It is a nicely designed bag, roomy and comfortable. I could fit clothes for a whole week plus obviously my iPad and Macbook Air. More importantly, the Thule customer service was amazing. The front zipper of the first back pack got eaten by my dog and was damaged. I wrote to Thule customer service asking them to send a replacement zipper so that I could get the back pack repaired. They proceeded to send a new bag under warranty. Obviously, such an event is not covered by warranty and I was not looking to get a new bag! Customer service beyond expectations!
0345803485|5.0|I absolutely LOVED this book! I could not put anyone of the books down! It had my full attention! lol Felt myself forgetting what time is was everytime I picked it up!
0345803485|1.0|Save your money.  The sex was that bad.  After a while I  found myself literally fast forwarding over the sex parts frantically trying to find a story, any story!!  Let's see - she's beautiful, articulate, witty and just plain wise beyond her years and oh yes, completely uninhibited sexually.  And despite no real life experience she knows just what to do in a blink of an eye.  She's even capable to performing psychotherapy.  All at the tender age of 21.  He's gorgeous, built, a genius, and gazillionaire, hung like a horse, can do it all night and then do it slow.  Over and over and over again.  I needed a commercial. I agree with one review - take Stephanie Meyers and take it down a couple of notches.  And that's bad. No one could possibly suspend enough belief for this to be worth the time and money to waste an afternoon.  Alas I ultimately remained unsatisfied.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|The book was one I did not want to put down and I was so glad I could read the other 2 right after the first one. I have told other friends about the book and we all have been talking about it and ready for another one---- we hope that there will be more.
B002KS1IJC|4.0|Oddly on my tivo this was only rated 2 stars. You can see the reviews here consider it much better than that. Seems to be a pretty good blend of a period piece, scifi, and monster, should appeal to a wide range of audiences. Though like a lot of these \\"blended\\" movies the \\"hard\\" scifi is minimal the actors will get you hooked.
0345803485|1.0|I had to agree with Dr Shobin, I too am a gynecologist and sit in hysterical horror reading these acrobatic interludes. Where have these people been? The human papilloma virus, Herpes, and all the viral STIs are a major public health concern but these folks don't need to worry because they're rich?  The idea of having sex exclusively with virgins is not new, it is common throughout Africa because as we all know 'having sex with a virgin will prevent and cure AIDS\\". However, the anal acrobatics leave me astounded. I can just read/see the sequel at 20 years when after continued destruction of the nervous plexus of her rectal, anal and vaginal tissues, she needs continuous (perhaps diamond-encrusted, Depends to control her incontinence from bowel and bladder. All the whips, chains and verbal controls in the world will not replace a loss of the involuntary nervous system. Any and all fluid deposited into the bowel tends to lead to a mad dash for the bathroom. Not much romantic there for most Anglo-Saxon types.<br /><br />Ann Rice, writing as A.N. Roquelaure  did a better job with the pseudo-\\"Dangerous Liaisons\\" ambiance.  Emma Holly does all of it so much better, with humor, and more importantly, love and affection.  Or try Lauren Dane. Jenny Penn can get pretty funny as well, but affection is under it all. For the more adventurous Shayla Black, and Robin Rothberg can get pretty sweaty. For the less literary, try Leah Brooke, though she is getting better at writing. This is by no means a comprehensive list, just a few I am aware of since deciding to take a look a bit on the \\"dark side\\"<br /><br />This is just the \\"Twilight Series\\" for the titillated 30-40 year old generation, and just as commercial.  But they won't advertise Depends, or condoms, just age and wrinkle creams and hair pieces.

B0043D2L9S|5.0|Looking at the photo (and the price) I never would have assumed the quality was as good as it is. I was very impressed with the construction and materials here - the D-rings are metal, the nylon is high quality, padding is good and it doesn't feel like it's going to fall apart any time soon.<br /><br />The harness is a bit heavier and stiffer than I was expecting, but I considered that a plus. The only time I've noticed it becoming an issue is when trying to fold it up and put away (it doesn't fold up much because of the thickness and stiffness of it - especially with the belt attached). Not a problem, just wasn't expected.<br /><br />Included in the package are a few pieces:<br /><br />The main vest/harness piece (includes the 2 sides + back)<br />2 additional nylon strips w/ hooks<br />Grip for the back<br /><br />Looking at the piece, I was a bit confused on what everything was for. The only thing you need to use it with a belt is the main vest/harness piece - the back is a long strip of nylon which connects to the S&F belt (either the [[ASIN:B0043D2L48 Lowepro S&F Deluxe Technical Belt (S/M) for Photographers]] or [[ASIN:B0043D2L70 Lowepro S&F Light Utility Belt for Photographers]] ). I was  a bit disappointed that the strip was so short (I would have liked another 6 inches or so). I imagine if you're over 6 feet that it might be a problem (unless you like the belt higher up)).<br /><br />The 2 hanging straps connect to each side in the front. I originally thought these hooked onto the D-rings, but they hook onto the nylon loop behind the D-Ring. I really liked this as it allowed me to still use the D-rings of the belt for attaching other items.<br /><br />The 2 optional straps appear to be for attaching the harness to one of the backpacks (I say \\"appear\\" as the harness does not include any instructions, and I think it needed some).<br /><br />On the 2 hanging straps (the ones attached) are D-rings near the top and a sliplock attachment on each side (made for the [[ASIN:B0043D2L7U Lowepro S&F Phone Case 20 for Vital Communication Device]] or other small accessories). I liked having these here as it's great to keep some items within quick reach. I do with they were a bit lower though.<br /><br />Finally, there is a very thick belt-buckle looking loop-accessory included. This attached to the top of the back and connects the harness to a backpack, giving you an easy grip to carry both the backpack + harness together. I'm glad they made this (and the 2 optional hooks) optional for those who are not using the backpack.. it's also nice that they included them instead of selling them separately!<br /><br />Finally, there is a strap across the front of the harness which connects the 2 sides together. This strap can be adjusted to whatever you find to be a comfortable position. The grey buckle on it also doubles as a \\"safety whistle\\" and works well. This strap is removable if you don't want it and includes a stretchy portion which is nice (so you don't need to keep it loose all the time - it will just stretch when needed)<br /><br />The 2 straps in front are adjustable to a pretty far length (I found this kind of weird since the strap in back is at a fixed, shorter length. The 2 straps in front also have a cover which keeps them neat and stops them from dangling. For some reason, the strap across the center does not have this \\"cover\\" to keep the excess nylon from hanging.<br /><br />Overall a very nice accessory for anyone using the belt. It's worth noting that you do need to use one of the belts above to make use of this accessory. While you might be able to wear it on it's own (and use the 2 sliplock attachments on the straps) it seems like it would be more of a challenge to deal with than it's worth.e [[ASIN:B0043D2L7U Lowepro S&F Phone Case 20 for Vital Communication Device]] or other small accessories).

0812550706|5.0|i think 'ender's game' is the only book i've read three times. for me books often don't have repeat reading value in the same way some movies have repeat viewing value.  it's probably because a movie takes two hours of your time while a novel, for me, takes a week or longer.  so for someone like to me read a novel twice, not to mention three times, is really saying something [and yes, i realize the inherent snobbery in that statement].<br /><br />i've thought long and hard about what makes 'ender's game' so appealing.  it's got a sympathetic protagonist, lots of great action, lots of heart, and a plausible twist of an ending.  on those merits only 'ender's game' works. it's a lot of fun to read and orson scott card manages to inject some really moral and ethical quandries without resorting to didactism or heavy-handedness.  for example, the manipulations of the battle school powers-that-be are presented and inspected, but card never explicitly paints them as the enemy.  they are who they are, for better or for worse, but it's up to the reader to for his or her own opinions. same for ender and his merry band of castoffs. card understands that good v. bad is never as simple as black v. white.  the world and universe are, more often than not, varying shades of gray. and the folks who inhabit that gray universe, for better or for worse, are who they are. they all have a part, they all have a purpose--even if those parts and purposes contradict each other.<br /><br />'ender's game' is also a great story of the value and importance of friendship. i choke up everytime ender's friends great him over the headset and the kids prepare for the final 'battle.'  who wouldn't want friends like bean, petra, hot soup and the rest? i sure would.<br /><br />but i think the real appeal for 'ender's game' comes from the belief that we all want to believe that there's something uniquely special about us. i think it's safe to assume that most of us have, at one point or another, felt like the underdog, the castoff, the misfit, the misunderstood, or the underappreciated, and that if people would just give us a chance, we'd shine.  in that way ender is very much a universal character.  he embodies a small part of each us.  yes, he is treated unfairly and manipulated, but he's also the smartest kid in the room.  there's something very appealing about that.  at least there is for me.  whether or not i'm the smartest person in the room is irrelevant, but i want to believe it. and whenever i read 'ender's game' there's a small hope that it just might be true.the underdog, the castoff, the misfit, the misunderstood, or the underappreciated, and that if people would just give us a chance, we'd shine.  in that way ender is very much a universal character.  he embodies a small part of each us.  yes, he is treated unfairly and manipulated, but he's also the smartest kid in the room.  there's something very appealing about that.  at least there is for me.  whether or not i'm the smartest person in the room is irrelevant, but i want to believe it. and whenever i read 'ender's game' there's a small hope that it just might be true.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Really!?!.....this is a cheap dime store paperback trying to act like a legitimate novel. i kept reading it hoping some sort of plot would develop other than deviant sex. half way through this book and there was still no clear plot so i doused it with lighter fluid and lit it up . maybe this author should move towards an area where this particular writing ability has a market, like writing scripts for adult films that require no real plot lines- cant believe i wasted $9.99 on this trash
B0072GPPNC|4.0|THIS WAS AN OKAY HORSE MOVIE . the story line was good and kept the viewers interest. Seemed somewhat far fetched. and maybe s bit slow and predictable in spots. Over all I felt it was a good movie. The disc was delivered on time and in excellent condition, Over all very pleased.

B0065GC0BA|4.0|This book discusses a controversial topic in a way that is sometimes comical and sometimes terribly sad: it captured me. It is well written and the characters are well described.
B0058YPGSY|5.0|Definitely addicting and what an amazing season! I feel like ever season tops the previous one and the 4th is definitely my favorite. I love the tension and the character Clay creates he just keeps dumping more and more stress on himself and love watching him try and weasal his way out of every situation.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This book really cought me. I love books which bring a bit of history and this one certainly does.

I'm looking forward to new books of this writer.

B003Y5H5HO|3.0|I'm new to the Millennium trilogy, both the books and Swedish film adaptations. So many people raved about the first book, in particular, that I was very much looking forward to watching the video.<br /><br />As the header to this review says I believe those expectations let me down.<br /><br />But let's look at the positives. Rooney Mara is outstanding in her role as Lisbeth. Daniel Craig once again shows that he is far more than just James Bond and does a good job. The cinematography was excellent. It was great seeing the move set in Sweden and it was very well shot.<br /><br />The beginning titles are superb but also reveal the strong evil undercurrent that pervades the movie. And it's that evil that I struggled with the most. The rape scenes are terrible and I wasn't at all prepared for those. It took me back to days of watching horror movies hiding behind the couch.<br /><br />The first third of the movie is quite slow and doesn't really get moving nor all that interesting until the two main characters get working together. At that point it moves along at good pace. It's a dialogue-rich movie that requires attention to track the investigation for a serial killer.<br /><br />It's not something I'd watch again and I'm not sure I will watch the second instalment except that I'm curious to know how it joins up with the first as there appeared to be closure at the end.

B002ZTQVGQ|5.0|First of all, my children really enjoy Studio Ghilbi's stories/movies. \\"Ponyo\\" is a wonderful and artful interpretation from this studio. Artwork and animation are interesting and well-directed.  For those viewers who are unfamiliar with Studio Ghibli and the respective directors, the stories and animations may be different from what you might expect from U.S. or domestic animated movies. Since I am a fan and have watched these animated movies from this studio, my children have gotten interested and really do enjoy these movies. Other movies that we have purchased from Amazon include \\"Castle in the Sky\\" and \\"Howl's Moving Castle\\", among others which are my kids' favorites as well. In my humble opinion, this movie presents the unique story-telling from Studio Ghibli, as well as original artwork/animation from the director and studio.  We are happy with this purchase.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The Hunger Games is a great read. It holds your interest all the way through. You want to read the sequels. I highly recommend it.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I haven't made time to read in quite some time. Once I started I couldn't put it down. I read all 3 50 Shades books within 1 week. They left me wanting more. If I had one criticism it would be that most of the steamy sex scenes are redundant. They are almost always in the same places & use the same wording. She needs to get a little more creative with her descriptives. Definitely made want to keep reading. Can't wait for her to come up with something new for me to read. Thanks E.L. James for getting me interested in books again.
B007BZM30M|5.0|Based on this song, Carly Rae Jepsen doesn't seem to be very different from other pop stars.  She has a decent voice, she looks perfectly prim on the artwork for this song and the lyrics of this song could have been written for anyone though I do give her credit for actually being one of the writers.<br /><br />However...<br /><br />This is a brilliantly catchy pop song.  After one listen I was instantly hooked and the chorus will effortlessly cement itself in your head thanks to what appears to be some genius keyboards.<br /><br />\\"Call Me Maybe\\" isn't a life changing song but it's tons of fun and will have you bopping your head and sometimes, when you want to throw your cares away and just have a good time, a song like this one is all you need.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Overall enjoying it. Good for kids and adults. I play for a bit then switch between other games and come back.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Great premise...rich, detailed, personal story that worked on many levels...great writing! Caught my attention on the first page and never let it go...definitely want the story to continue!
B007MDB71O|5.0|John Carter was the best film I have seen this past decade.  Wish it had been advertised more but everyone I know who did see the film simply LOVED it!  I can't wait for it to come out on DVD/Blu-ray.  You will love this film!  A wonderful story, an incomparable cast, and the characters are simply fantastic!  Based on Edgar Rice Burroughs novels, George Lucas patterned Star Wars after John Carter From mars. Although I am anxiously awaiting the DVD release, I hope Disney will realize just how HUGE the fan base is out there for John Carter and make the sequel. Because....I want to go BACK TO BARSOOM!!
B005EGXTEE|3.0|Read the books one after the other within a few weeks. Interesting theme, fast paced in certain parts but did not keep me engaged. Lost momentum in the second book but picked it up again in the last book which was good. Not a book I would typically select but was suggested  by my daughter who loved them and we enjoyed having discussions about the themes, characters etc.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|Why can't we have the awesome version like iPhone? I have unlocked and beaten everything, I love this game, but now its boring! My husband has an iPhone and he has all kinds of stuff to unlock still. Why is their version so much better than ours? I just updated hoping it would make it more awesome, but it looks the exact same. Great game, just wish they would show Android the same love as Apple! Come on...
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great game...really enjoy it.  Would recommend it to family and friends...Love the auto complete when you win.  Graphics are excellent
B003L77GRO|5.0|Dexter continues to surprise.  There are some twists to the plot, especially in this season.  Good season, great acting.  I don't know how the writers create such plots!  Michael C. Hall continues to put his own spin to the Dexter character.
B001ECQ6E2|1.0|I purchased this DVD along with several others. Just a few days ago I was able to view it . IT DOES NOT PLAY COMPLETELY. While all the others do. I would like to return the defective item. Thank you.
0345803485|5.0|I received my book on a Saturday morning which I normally clean my house on Saturdays but I sat down & started to read it- this is the first book I have read in years as I just can't find the time anymore. Needless to say- I couldn't put it down- I finished it the same day & ordered the other 2 books in this series & of course- my house didn't get cleaned till Sunday!! LOL
B006OCM0G0|5.0|Enjoy this game. Lots of fun picking out stuff to cook. Kids like to play it too. Great family game.

B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I was very captivated by the 3 books of this series, took me 10 days and I had gone trough them.<br />My wife was desperatly lonely until I had finished them ;)<br />An untraditional book, on a possible futur, if we don't control our destructive human instincts....

B004ECDNJU|4.0|This is a great game, and very addictive but it could use more levels. Overall though it's an original concept and enjoyable to play.
1416583432|2.0|Let me start by admitting that I have not yet finished this book. I've decided to write this review before finishing because I'm not sure that I will.  I've hit the 3/4 mark waiting for some sort of turn around, but it doesn't appear to be coming.<br /><br />I will say that it is obvious that the author loves dogs and I think that is fantastic. That's what makes writing a negative review so difficult. The truth is that this book misses the mark on a number of points many of which have already been accurately pointed out in other reviews. She has a habit of stating opinions as fact and a majority of the facts that she does point out are so obvious that if you've ever owned a dog or spent time with one you should have already picked up on. The author also has a difficult time succinctly stating things. By the time she's finished talking about a simple topic I'd either lost interest in it or gotten the feeling the book was written with an audience in mind that had never seen a dog before. There are footnotes on about every other page which gives you the feeling that you're ready a first draft with notes. Finally, the little anecdotes about her own dog that open many of the sections begins to grow old fairly early on.<br /><br />I've given this book two stars mainly due to the fact that it's clear that the author's heart was in the right place. She loves dogs and wanted to do something to help people better understand their dogs. Unfortunately, she misses the mark.
B005X5MXM0|5.0|I am very pleased with this DVD. For the most part the quality is great, a few times when the camera position changes I get bars across the screen, not sure if this was due to the actual position of the camera or a production issue, but this was not a major issue as it is quickly corrected. I have only watched this on my computer and not a larger TV. I loved seeing Ian and Mick together again, I saw them at the Santa Monica Civic and two of the seven shows at the Roxy in Hollywood in '79, If I didn't know this was in Germany it could have been any of the shows I saw. I do wish this show had happened a couple of years later, then I may have been able to attend as I was in Germany in '82 and '83. The song set was great on the DVD, I loved seeing the shots of Mick and the close-ups of his fingers. This is the best quality video I remember seeing of Mick. I wish there was a DVD of Welcome to the Club that I could use to compare it to, am I missing something? I have told my friends about this and they are interested in purchasing this.

0307716546|5.0|I was blown away by Lupton's \\"Afterwards\\". It's incredibly inventive and though it's on the romance side of the mystery genre it wasn't cloying. Likewise the fantasy or paranormal elements feel believable. The story is told in almost omniscient, first person, present tense by a mother who is a fulltime homemaker. Grace has a son, Adam who's just turned eight and a beautiful seventeen year old daughter, Jenny. On Adam's school sports day Jenny is working as the onsite nurse and Grace is there to watch the games. It's a beautiful, warm July day with kids running everywhere having fun. Then tragedy strikes, the school catches on fire and Grace runs in to the inferno to rescue Jenny. She's almost too late. Jenny is horribly burned and Grace suffers a serious head injury. They both wind up in the hospital.<br /><br />So far we're in the mundane world but things change when Grace and Jenny find they can leave their damaged bodies and talk to one another freely. They watch, unseen except by one another, as their loved ones mourn, worry, and try to solve the mystery of who purposely set the school fire and why. I know some people are put off by first person accounts as well as those told in the present tense but Lupton writes so beautifully and with such insight it's not a distraction.....in fact it seemed to me the perfect way to tell this moving story.<br /><br />This review is based on an e-galley provided by the publisher.<br /><br />4.5/5 stars
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Love to have the Bible on my kindle device. Its so convenient. I can read to my ten year old anytime.

I was sold on this cd from the jump(even though im not a nas fan,these 2 together are a great pair).I hunted and hunted until someone suggested amazon.When i wanna be enlighten,educated and feel good, i listen to this.
0307276902|3.0|I liked the way it was written. Some parts were so intense. But as most of us know lots of his stuff has been debunked now. For that reason on 3 stars from me. a good read
B005IQZB14|5.0|I really enjoyed this story of what is possible when you hit bottom, give yourself a seemingly impossible goal and accomplish it.  The writing hooked me in the beginning but got a bit stale 2/3's through.  I found it inspiring- maybe the AT (seems tamer than PCT) will be my adventure soon.

B005K0HDGE|5.0|While King's fantastic book is over 800 pages, I couldn't help but envision a sequel. He did such a great job of building to the climax.Then, when you see the long-term results you realize that he still hs more work to do. But he's out of pages! Stevie! Don't leave us hanging. Inquiring readers want to know!!!

B007JQLNXG|5.0|Peter Gabriel is undoubtably one of my favourite live music performers : his 'Secret World Tour' was very entertaining & enjoyable as was 'Secret World 1994 Live' DVD recorded in Modena, Italy. But veteran rock musician Peter Gabriel goes here one better in this new 2 CD (22 tracks) release titled 'New Blood Live In London' : he and his 46 piece New Blood Orchestra present wonderful & interesting orchestral arrangements of songs including his classics \\"Washing Of The Water\\", \\"Biko\\", \\"Mercy Street\\", \\"Blood Of Eden\\", \\"Red Rain\\", \\"Solsbury Hill\\", \\"In Your Eyes\\" & \\"Don't Give Up\\" among others. The sound quality of this recording is exceptional and Peter Gabriel's musicianship unparalleled (great orchestral arrangements & his incredible lead vocals)! Sounds as if his voice is getting better with age on this release.<br /><br />Disc 1 : This is my favourite disc (11 tracks) of the two. Stand-outs/gems/solid tracks include \\"Wallflower\\" (great piano, melody & vocals), \\"Apre's Moi\\", \\"Washing Of The Water\\" (great duet, like it better than the studio track from the 1992 album 'Us') & \\"The Book Of Love\\" (incredible melody & vocals. This is my favourite performance track from the veteran). Great tracks include \\"Intruder\\" (orchestral movie score-like opening track), \\"Boy In The Bubble\\" (Paul Simon cover, slow-tempo track with great piano & vocals), \\"The Drop\\", \\"Darkness\\" (orchestral movie score-like, some 'talk/rappy' vocals, great duet), \\"Power Of The Heart\\", \\"Biko\\" (inspiring story/song  about the death of Black Consciousness leader Steve Biko under apartheid in South Africa in 1977 under police custody. Would prefer the studio version, but has great orchestral arrangements nevertheless) & \\"San Jacinto\\". There is no weak track to talk of.<br /><br />Disc 2 :  This has 11 tracks as well. Stand-outs/gems/solid tracks include \\"Mercy Street\\" (beautiful 'tubular bells-like' orchestral sound & great vocals), \\"Red Rain\\", \\"Don't Give Up\\" (unbelievable vocals) & \\"The Nest That Sailed The Sky\\". Great tracks include \\"Digging In The Dirt\\" (great duet), \\"Signal To The Noise\\", \\"Downside Up\\", \\"The Rhythm Of The Heat\\" (interesting great orchestral sound & vocals), \\"Blood Of Eden\\" (this is one of my favourite Peter Gabriel song, very interesting orchestral arrangements), \\"Solsbury Hill\\" & \\"In Your Eyes\\" (always a crowd's favourite whether singing it with Youssou N'Dour or Papa Wemba or on this orchestral arrangement here : the crowd is on their feet & cheering).  There is also no weak track to talk of in this CD either.<br /><br />On overall, the veteran Peter Gabriel has outdone himself in this new beautiful orchestral arrangements of songs with his New Blood Orchestra in a 2 CD release, incredible performances & sound quality. A well deserved 5 star performance & a highly recommended 2 CD release listening!
B007SYWFRM|4.0|this is fun. ... I also had a problem leaving the game .... I will try through stuff as directed in another review.... if they fix the problem I would leave a five star review

B002RI9PKO|5.0|In an interesting and well documented text, Malcolm Gladwell show us that there are factors that influence when somebody is extraordinary. He proposes that 10,000 hours of practice make us outstanding; that's why The Beatles -who played on stage in Hamburg for 270 days, 8 hours a day make their special sound, or why the Hockey players born in january-febraury had more chances of make it to NHL (because they are closer to start date). Very interesting, but it could be called \\"The 10,000 hours rule to be an outlier.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This trilogy was the best trilogy I ever read! Would definitely recommend to others. I'm actually reading it again for the second time.
B005AVIZ6U|2.0|The central character to lee child's books is remarkably likable while being decidedly ridiculous. Jack is a comic book type hero who overcomes all evil despite seemingly insurmountable odds. Every book is a high fidelity copy in style and character arrangements of the previous installment;  the phrases used in the novels and the unfolding of events are so predictable the author should be given a medal for deep loyalty to his point of departure, namely comic book style he-man and action. The plots are complex. If verifiable, much can be learned about guns, military protocol, close combat and anatomy, especially wrecked anatomy. Very much a boy's book. All sixteen of them. Great fun to read, literary garbage.
B004UHSB5A|4.0|A way you to do away with domino's being placed on top of each other to make plays. you can't do it in real life you shouldn't be able to on the game.
1451627289|5.0|To truly appreciate this book you must try to insert yourself into the time period to appreciate King's perspective. If you really see the detail you would think......he did time travel!!!  The reference to Johnny Carson's \\"who do you trust\\" is amazing.  King is living this book!  His best since Dolores Claiborne!!!!
0345803485|1.0|This book is a turgid mess.  I couldn't finish it.  One of the things that got me was the constant repetition of certain phrases -- \\"holy s***\\" and \\"inner goddess\\".  I love good, realistic sex scenes (bdsm included) but the very premise of this book kept me from getting into the character's head.  I can't relate to an innocent girl who suddenly agrees to sign a contract like this.  The motivation just wasn't there for me.
B007X15GRQ|5.0|great movie, learned a lot about cargo smuggling, actors believable plot, intense edge of your seat, surprise ending, blast til the end
B005RUV0NY|5.0|So addicting!  Great story line for the first 2 seasons however I am sceptical to see what is going to happen beyond these seasons, only so much can happen.  Great graphics, they really do go all out.  When I watched the first episode i thought it was a movie.

B007JQLNXG|5.0|Just when you think you have Peter Gabriel all figured out, he surprises his fans with yet another innovative approach to musical performance. This time, it's with his new live CD entitled Live Blood. Recorded at the beautifully simple and iconic Hammersmith Apollo in London in March of last year, the acoustics of the venue positively adds to the music that you didn't think could be augmented.<br /><br />Forgoing drums and guitars of a usual rock show - even a progressive rock show like Gabriel's, the distinguished artist instead implemented the 46-piece New Blood Orchestra. In doing so, he \\"re-imagined\\" some of his best known songs with awe-inspiring orchestral arrangements.<br /><br />Picking the Boomerocity short list of favorites is difficult.  In the battle for first is Gabriel's treatment of Paul Simon's The Boy in the Bubble.  As he did on the Scratch My Back album, Peter dials this back a few beats per second as compared to Simon's original.  In a live setting with full orchestra, it really does have a spine tingling effect.<br /><br />Coincidentally, a second choice for our short list is another tune Gabriel recorded on Scratch My Back - The Power of the Heart, which was written by Lou Reed.  As with Bubble, this live version gives chills to the body and leaves your mouth open from its beauty.<br /><br />Last but certainly not least on the Boomerocity short list of favorites is Red Rain which comes from Peter's chart topping 1986 album, So.  Just as the 3D video of this tune is mind-blowing, just listening to the audio is an incredible experience in and of itself.  Add to that experience by listening through a great pair of headphones and you're in for an unforgettable experience.<br /><br />Fans of prog, Gabriel and earlier Genesis will definitely want this CD in their listening library. You won't be disappointed.<br /><br />Boomerocity.com
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is a great book. Love every min of reading it. So glad that there are two more to go along with it
0307888908|4.0|This book begins with an excellent thought from the Noble Prize winner Mohammad Yunus, \\"As humans we are all born entrepreneurs. When we were in caves, we were all self-employed, finding our own food, feeding ourselves. As civilization came, we suppressed it. We became \\"Labor\\" because they stamped us, \\"You are Labor\\". We forgot that we are entrepreneurs\\". Authored by co-founder of LinkedIn Reid Hoffman and Ben Casnocha a renowned entrepreneur, this book speaks about how one can go about enriching his/her carrier by thinking on the lines of an entrepreneur.<br /><br />The book to me is mainly about the following \\"3\\" things:<br /><br />  How can I stand-out in the competitive world around me?<br />  How do I go about planning to make myself competitive?<br />  Lastly how do I build and develop a give-and-take relationship with the network of people around me?<br /><br />  In the first part, the author explains how we can make ourselves competitive and make ourselves stand-out in the mad rush by focusing and becoming very clear about the following three factors:<br /><br />  Identify what are your \\"assets\\" that make your different or unique from the other individuals in your area of expertise<br />  Identify what are you \\"aspirations\\" or \\"values\\" that guide and motivate your actions<br />  Identify the current \\"market realities\\". Having a skill set which is not needed in the market you are in, will not help you in the long run.<br /><br />Secondly, the author explains why most of us loose our entrepreneurial edge; it is because of a lack of plan. Since we do not have plan in place, we find it very hard to take risks. The author recommends  \\"ABZ\\" planning philosophy.<br /><br />  A: Your Plan-A is your primary plan, which you want to work on or achieve. for e.g. starting a new for-profit business<br />  B: Your Plan-B is the immediate back-up plan for Plan-A. It is always somewhere in the vicinity of Plan-A and not too far away or out of the domain of Plan-A. for e.g. Imight not be able to start my own business, but I might be able to score an executive position in a new start-up<br />  Z: Your Plan-Z is your failure plan. If Plans A & B fail, you should have a Plan-Z that you can go back to. Risks, which lead you to streets are unplanned risks and should never be taken. So in our e.g. your Plan-Z might be to take a contract job if your plans A & B fail<br /><br />In the Last part of the book, the author has gone at length to explain the value of having a network of people around you. In a way, I could sense the author was advertising LinkedIn, but he did it very smartly and explained the advantages of having a good network of people around you. The author points a research which had concluded that every person on this earth, is connected to every other person by an average of \\"7\\" links. So if I am sitting in New Jersey as I type this blog, I am connected to someone in Jakarta by an average of \\"7\\" people. Amazing!<br /><br />Overall this book is an ace for me; it brings to light how we can start thinking like entrepreneurs by developing our competitive advantage, doing the ABZ planning, pursuing breakout opportunities, taking intelligent risks and tapping into the intelligence network around us. I hope I have intrigued you enough, to go read the book.

You can set multiple alarms at the same time, and there's even a timer too. It doesn't drain my battery at all, and it's plenty loud enough. Sometimes it scares me out of bed. ;)<br /><br />I would recommend this to someone, definitely. It's really simple and does exactly what an alarm is supposed to: goes off and wakes you up. It's really cool.

B006Z4LOPK|5.0|A must have for those Sci-Fi/Fantasy lovers out there, especially those who once loved Buffy and Angel - two series Lost Girl is constantly compared to.  It is, however, targeted to a more mature audience, given its sexual content. Bo (played brilliantly by Anna Silk) is a Succubus raised by humans that runs away from home once she drains her first boyfriend to death. Ten years later, she is found and targeted by the Fae when suspiciously leaving a body behind after protecting human sidekick Kenzi (Ksenia Solo) from a man at a local bar. Bo soon learns that the Fae are divided between Light and Dark and refuses to make a choice -- which is a parallel to Bo's own sexuality;  a bisexual Succubus, constantly torn between two lovers: Light Fae detective Dyson (Kris Holden-Ried) and  human doctor Lauren (Zoie Palmer). The first season is about Bo's search for her true identity as we are introduced to the Fae world and its various secrets and ramifications.<br /><br />The love triangle is one of the show's biggest draws, particularly because both lovers bring something different to the table: Dyson, the territorial alpha male, provides sexual healing - literally - in an electrifying friends with benefits relationship. Lauren, the fragile, geeky beta female, provides the human warmth and emotional connection/support Bo so desperately needs. The latter is particularly satisfying because  Bo and Lauren's relationship isn't played for male titillation; it is straightforward, it is real and it resonates with the audience. Their chemistry is heart-wrenching and beautiful and fortunately, only a taste of what's to come in season 2.

B0063GORYU|5.0|This app works really well. If you've played spider solitaire on you computer, you know how to play this. It is a little odd that you have to tap the play area to get the hint/undo/new game menu. Excellent free app.

0345803485|1.0|I admit,  I am only halfway through this book,  but it is repetitive and  silly.  The characters say (and do) the same things over and over.  The \\"everything\\" of this book seems ridiculous.  Not sure what all the fuss is about.  This book, like the Hunger Games and Twilight,  are just not that great.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I do not usually read this type of book.  I picked this up after hearing about it from a friend that urged me to read it.  I loved this story.  I cant wait to start reading the second one.  All i can tell you without giving everything away is that its a love story with some dirty sexy time in the middle of it. Either you are going to love it or you will hate it.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|My 13 year old daughter tried to get it at the library but there was a waiting list and of course she couldn't wait! So I spent $5 for the kindle version. She seemed thrilled by it and I've heard older people seemed enthralled by this novel and want to continue through the other 2 episodes which make up a trilogy.<br />I was intrigued by the writing style, the fluidity of the story line which opens with the heroine Katnis getting out of bed in the morning and wishing she could kill her sister's beloved cat. Right there you get a jolt. This 16 year old girl has a vicious streak. She does love her sister however. She has definite strong character traits.<br />Katnis has a daily mission - to feed her sister and mother by hunting with a male friend in the illegal territory of woods. She is a true shot with her bow and arrow. She's joined with a boy just slightly older than herself whom, she infers is just a friend. No love interest. They are both out to survive and keep their families from starving.<br />The main plot is the ghastly program run by the Capital, an iron fisted government that demands two young people, one male, one female, between 12-18 from each of the 12 \\"districts\\" to come together into an \\"Arena\\" of weird changeability, woods, mountain, lake, dangerous unreal wildlife. The object is to survive not only this environment, but to kill everyone else until one survives - the glorified Victor.<br />Katnis's 12 year old sister, Prim, has her name drawn. Katnis immediately volunteers herself as substitute. This is a very emotional, telling moment - this heroine has strong feelings, both of love and ferocious determination.<br />Why do I think this story is for female juveniles? - First of course there's teenage Katnis, who is heroine all the way through. Then, during the glorified preparations with much ceremony and fanfare before the \\"Games\\" begin, there is plenty of costume and makeup description most girls enjoy. I don't think a boy would be so enthralledby this. She is attended by two skilled body beauticians and one very creative costume designer. Her male counterpart also gets a makeover, but that's a minor supplement. A boy might like the episode about weapons training.<br />I'm not going to go into detail about the Game itself. It's the super-adventure part. Really really out of this world in scary detail and weird happenings, and if you like this, then the book is for you!<br />Then, finally, there's a Love bit - can't have a juvenile girl's story without Romance! Her male companion, Peter, claims to be in love with her right in the Game's outset, much to the joy of the Capital. They defend each other through it all. A big thing is made of this also by the blood thirsty Capital as entertainment. All is televised to the entire country. The people have to watch. Whether they approve, is not allowed. I'm sure they watch with horror and apprehension. After all - their children are being forced to fight to the death, with only one survivor.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is not a book I would normally read, but my 13 year old granddaughter read it and was very excited by the series. I was curious to learn more about her interest. After reading the first book in the trilogy, I promptly ordered the other two books.  The books are very well written and held my interest in the story line.  I would encourage parents and grandparents to read the trilogy, as it provides various discussion topics to engage in with young people.
0545265355|4.0|Hi folks, my grandson (a High School Freshman) gave me a copy of the Hunger Games. I took a peek and was immediately drawn in to the saga. I ended up reading the Hunger Games in two days and ordered the set. I liked them all. My lovely wife also read them all as did our kids and grand kids. Great summer read. The set was a bargain and I have no idea how many of our friends and family will get to enjoy the series.
0553801473|2.0|I read this series twice, up to Feast for Crows, once when they first came out and again while I was waiting for the fifth book to come out. A year later, the fifth book finally came out, and honestly I was pretty disappointed. The other books kept me reading until the wee hours of the night, and sometimes missing class because they were so good. This fifth book, took me two months to get through. He references really minor characters from the previous books without giving you any jog of memory as to how you remember them. Of course this can be really annoying and over done in some books, especially if you are powering through a series without stopping, but you have to expect a least a little explanation for minor characters that are brought up again. A lot of times I was just confused, and that is probably why it felt like such a chore to read.<br /><br />Also, it seemed like everything was drawn out in the chapters until a final peak at the end to keep you interested in maintaining that story line until you came across it again later in the book. It's like he had bullet points of the significant event that were suppose to happen in each chapter, and then just wrote fluff around it. I thought the fourth book was a little boring, but the fifth was worse. It also really seemed to 'borrow' a lot of elements of Robert Jordan's book, but maybe I only just noticed this because I began reading his series before getting to the fifth book. Finally, I remember some of the violence and sex scenes adding more intrigue to the previous books, but in the fifth, they just bordered on vulgar. All in all, I doubt I will read this book again or any of them afterwards. I would rather cherish my memory of an awesome series that was the best kept-secret until its exploitation by HBO.
0307888908|4.0|Despite a forced analogy of starting a company and relaunching an individual's career and the obvious promotion for LinkedIn, the core messages in this book is very useful for anyone who wants to even re-evaluate one's career plan and find ways to improve growth potential.  The section on \\"pivoting\\" is perhaps the most useful part of this book where a reader gets an opportunity to assess the potential and risks for any career changes (ironically, an analogy the authors missed to explore fully - adjacent possible or brand extension) - could have helped reader grasp these concepts better. Overall, the structure of the book is very conducive for a step-by-step evaluation of one's career and id potential specific actions to address any gaps or accentuate strengths (some of them seem obvious after reading them - but provides a very good checklist).  In addition to [[ASIN:1591844096 Linchpin: Are You Indispensable?]], this book can become an excellent resource for re-evaluating one's career and define a \\"change plan\\".  The constant comparison (forced) with entrepreneurship distracts the reader primarily because the similarities exist only superficially - the risk profile borne by an individual in these two contexts are so different making any comparisons incomplete. An entrepreneur may also have the luxury to manage risk with developing a portfolio of ideas - far less feasible for an individual with a day job. Despite these minor quibbles, the authors provide a very systematic thought exercise that will benefit anyone looking to reassess career paths. 4.5*

0316056863|5.0|Of course I am a huge Tina Fey fan.  She is brilliant!  Her book is a fun read - almost as much fun as watching her perform - in anything!  She is so witty and clever - and intelligent!  I am her exact age, and although I am no movie star, professional actor or comedian, or author or writer... we share so much in common - and most women can probably relate to her on some level - I especially love the comment, \\"you'd be pretty if you lost weight.\\"  I can't say how many guys I dated would say to me, \\"you have potential!\\"  Anyhow, if you like to laugh, buy this book!  Enjoy!  I seriously considered buying the kindle verson because I love my kindle so much, but I couldn't resist the hard back copy.  It's one I'll share and read over and over!
B0031RSBU0|4.0|A classic Mankell and Kurt Wallander story. The surprise element is taking Kurt out of his familiar Ystad surroundings and taking him over to Riga in Latvia. This is starnge territory for Wallander readers, but made interesting by th plot. Worth reading as always.
B007LYB0PC|5.0|Jack White did everything right on here from start to finish. This was an album I knew I would love before i even purchased it.
0439023513|1.0|Very disappointed in this conclusion to the series.  A necessary read because of the emotional involvement I had from reading the first two books in the series, but INCREDIBLY disappointed in the author's end to the trilogy.<br /><br />The best way I can summarize it is this:  Katniss is transformed from survivalist killer to vengeful killer.  Almost everyone that she cares about is killed.  There are compelling plot twists, considerable gore, and almost no character development.  The last 2 pages of the book attempt to tie all the loose ends together with a Happily Nightmare Ever After and the 'good guys' do win, but I think most every reader will walk away unfulfilled.<br /><br />The only hope for redemption?  If the book is made into a movie and screenwriters stray dramatically from Collins' writing.
B00005QGAT|5.0|In all my years, I never had owned a Michael Jackson album, in his living years. Something compelled me to purchase a few of his albums, posthumously, just to get a better sense of the artist, on my own terms - free of any previous knowledge of his body of work (which is vast and eclectic).<br /><br />What I love about this album is the freedom and depth of sincerity I sense in Michael's performances, here. This was before the nose jobs, the media drama and the false molestation accusations. This was back when MJ was considered a young and dynamic heartthrob. Off The Wall was prior to Thriller and the rocket that would launch his career in the Moonwalk and the 25th Anniversary MoTown Special.<br /><br />Some of the songs that best embody this brilliant album (with high production standards set by the legendary Quincy Jones) are \\"Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough,\\" \\"Off The Wall,\\" \\"Burn This Disco\\" and \\"Girlfriend,\\" just to name a few. You feel as though you have set foot on the floor of a disco where it's all party, all the time. Whenever I put this record on, I know I am going to feel happy to be alive. It is full of a spirit of spontaneity and high professionalism. The tunes are memorable, as are the lyrics. Just great and unbeatable.

B000002U8I|5.0|I have admired Tina Turner, since I was about ten years old. My recollection is of seeing footage of her, with Ike Turner, in a dance documentary on PBS. The documentary was EVERYBODY DANCE NOW. It was brilliant and so was she. Just recently, I finally had the opportunity to view What's Love Got To Do WIth It?, the docudrama of her life story. What a courageous and amazing example of a modern day survivor of domestic violence, who went on to emancipate herself from her turbulent past into a bright present.<br /><br />Private Dancer is a collection of some of her finest solo work, originally released in 1984. The title cut is chilling and cuts to the quick. It takes a dark look at the world of exotic dancing. Tina embodies the role of private dancer who reiterates that the men she dances for aren't human and she never knows their names. Of course, What's Love Got To Do With It is also featured here. There are both versions - the one we have come to recognize and the extended cut. I swear, I could dance to that song all day long. The lyrics are so contemporary. They are great for any woman who has ever been disrespected by a lover. I feel them. There are other great cuts, like Steel Claw and I Can't Stand the Rain. Tina sexily purrs her way through all of the songs, and injects a hearty dose of soul into every song she embodies as musician and artist. Just a brilliant little album.
B004EPYZV2|5.0|I really liked this movie because it was so action packed.  The entire series is pretty good.  I loved this deal (I got it for $20) because you get so much!  You get the Blu-Ray, the DVD, a digital copy (your choice of format from iTunes, Windows Media, Amazon Instant, and VUDU), and a Ultra Violet Streaming copy!  I downloaded the digital copy asap, which I highly recommend as they are not guaranteed forever.  I learned this the hard way with The Incredible Hulk.  You need to check the expiration of the digital copy, sometimes they expire after a couple of years.  Anyway, the movie was great and the extras were really cool too.  They show you how they did the entire scene on the tall building in Dubai.
B007KOYEOC|4.0|Awesome trio of books. This being the last in the series of books it kept me intrigued.  These books may not be everyone's cup of tea, but was mine and I would recommend anyone to read the set.

0345803485|2.0|I read the trilogy and, honestly, I wasn't all that impressed.  I bought it because of the spice and I am all for a little spice in my reading but, this story went overboard and bored the heck out of me.  Every few pages was a sexual encounter.  The story line was good but I really think it didn't need that much sex to make it interesting.  The story could have been told in one book.  Too much hoopla for nothing.
0345803485|2.0|Okay, maybe if I had envisioned George Clooney as Christian I might not have yawned my way thru this book.
B005LAIGYQ|5.0|There are already quite a few detailed reviews and I will not bore you with another one. I can't say how happy I was to see a real portrayal of men who put it all on the line for our nation. I myself am a combat veteran and can relate to them. The movie shows the hardships of being on a SEAL team and the sacrifices they have to make on a daily basis. God bless our men in uniform as we are the 1% of the population who have chosen to put it all on the line for a cause greater than ourselves.

B0000VCZK2|5.0|This release of the 'Alien' movies is still the best option to get for any fan of the franchise.  Save for maybe the BLU-RAY release.  I personally am still on DVD, so that's what I'm reviewing.  I imagine both sets are practically identical content-wise.<br /><br />This set  was released some years ago, and was at the time AND still is the definitive way to own these movies.  With this box-set you get 'Alien', 'Aliens', 'Alien 3', and 'Alien Resurrection'.  'Alien' & 'Aliens' are epic.  'Alien 3' is good.  'Alien Resurrection' lacked, but as a fan you still need to own it.<br /><br />Action wise 'Aliens' is your best option.  Space marines going in with huge guns to kill the Xenomorphs, how can you go wrong.  At the end when Ripley walks in with that 'Mech Warrior' looking suit on and attacks the Queen Alien, you feel like starting a church in honor of James Cameron.  Bear in mind he had no CG to use also, and still made this stellar movie.  Oh, thank Ridley Scott while your at it.<br /><br />But the big selling point with this set is not just the movies, but the fact you get director cuts AND more special features than you could burn through on a hooky day from work.  It probably would take you a weekend to go through them all.<br /><br />The case itself is gorgious, (I word I don't use too often), and quite sturdy.  I personally like this design.  It holds the discs very securely.  So if it's thrown into your bag or whatever, the discs should not come loose.<br /><br />I have been the proud owner of this set for years now.  One of the best collections of movies I own.<br /><br />Now that 'Promethius' is coming out, get this release and re-amerse yourself before seeing the highly anticipated prequel this summer.<br /><br />Would rave more about the 'Alien' franchise and this deluxe boxset, but a facehugger is latched to my face, so long...
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|The game is awesome, but once I got to a certain level...it glitched out and now will take 355 hrs until I can collect on anything.  I called Gameloft and they redirected me to an email.  I have to say I am very put off by their customer service and lack of interest in the problem.  This needs some serious updating or I am going to cut my losses and delete the game.  Makes me sad, I finally found a game I liked and then this happens....soooo frustrating!
B005HSG3VK|4.0|It protects my kindle and it doesn't add a lot of weight.  I've found it easy to slip into my purse to carry with me.
B006M4RN3U|5.0|I just found out about Fun. right before We Are Young became popular, and I at first started listening to Aim and Ignite. Most people will agree that is better than Some Nights. You cannot compare them. Aim and Ignite sounds more like classic rock, or a musical play. Some Nights is more of pop and rock mixed. To the people complaining about the auto tune. It is used as an effect, not to make Nate sound better...you should know that. Favorite songs for me are Some Nights (the a cappella in the beginning is amazing and I love the \\"epic\\" sound to it), Carry On (a slow but another \\"epic\\" song, with what sounds like bagpipes...making it that much better!), Why Am I The One, All Alone, and Stars. I recommend getting this album if you really like ballads and very good lyrical songs.<br /><br />Fun. and Some Nights is my favorite band/album ever, by the way!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|All I can say is, OMG, now I have to get the others! A must read for almost anyone!! A whole new experience for me
B005Y423ZC|3.0|I was disappointed in the tape I bought. The favorite song and why I bought this tape wasn't what I expected. Adel and the audience sang together in much of this song.

B002MQYOFW|3.0|THE GAME JUST SEEMED TO GO ON FOR TOO LONG WITHOUT ADDING MUCH TO THE PLOT .<br /> IT OBVIOUSLY WAS DESIGNED FOR A FILM
B006AX6ONI|3.0|The thing I liked best about this book was the low price (2.99). The book is a collection of the author's blog posts, but reads quite well, and does not feel totally disjointed as some blog-collections do.<br /><br />The book recounts the author's career in business, and includes the long story of his many failures, dumb things done, and many \\"career\\" switches he made along the way to his eventual success. I couldn't help but feel that his early business life especially seemed to be mostly a long, random, unplanned, party-filled sequence of \\"have fun at whatever seems to be working at the moment\\" events.<br /><br />Nonetheless, he does communicate the message that it wasn't all partying, and that he did in fact work really hard and stay up late to read all those early DOS manuals at the birth of the PC industry, and did in fact catch the PC business wave with his MicroSolutions service company, and did in fact provide a valued business service to real customers, and was in fact able to sell out (maybe near the peak) for enough money to retire and tour the world, as many entrepreneurs did in those days. And you must respect that effort, for sure.<br /><br />FWIW, I would guess this is the journey--running and scaling up a real business -- where he learned a lot of his good business lessons. He doesn't say much at all about selling off Broadcast.com for a stunning pile of money right at the peak of the dot com bubble, which is probably good for this book, because obviously that success had far more to do with being lucky with a willing purchaser at the right time and place in the dot com world of the day than it did with business skill. (Although once again, you must respect the ability to cash in at the right moment, since many did not. Credit to the author for his sales skill and developed senses and timing on that one!)<br /><br />The part of the book I liked the best was at the end, when he gives two short lists of rules and principles that condense his experiences into a consumable form. Some he used for many years in his journey (and so are time-worn and tried and true presumably), but some have the feel of being formed in retrospect, after his successes (which may or may not contribute to their values as \\"how to win\\" or \\"lessons learned in retrospect\\" principles). Anyhow, they are clearly presented and each have enough substance to be worthwhile (as opposed to the shallow and trivial ones you sometimes read in really, really light business books).<br /><br />All in all, I think this book is a good buy because of its price, but I wouldn't feel good about paying $15, or even $10 for it, because I couldn't find anything new (to me) in it. But for the price, it was a reasonable story and affirmation of some useful principles for running your life.<br /><br />Come to think of it, I would definitely say that his principles for running your life (and esp for people of college or college grad age) are the best part of the book, by far. And I find it funny-haha (not funny strange) how I come away smiling at the thought of the author writing mostly to college-age party kids when he's travelled a unique (and often party-filled) path to massive fortune by catching the once-in-a-lifetime dot-com wave and playing it masterfully with a really big dose of luck at the blow off top. Who knows, maybe you can party lots and still be massively successful if you're in the right place at the right time, catch the wave, and don't screw up too badly, so you can ride it to the top and sell out before the crash.<br /><br />My last comments remind me to recommend that you go read Gladwell's Outliers book, where he argues very well that Gates and Jobs were also exactly the right age, and exactly in the right place and time to also catch the PC wave that made them rich. That was a very interesting argument, because I was there (as a kid) reading about the start of it all in the late 60s, and Gladwell makes a very good case that if Gates and Jobs wereeven a few year older or younger, they would have missed their particular waves, and the successes would have gone to other people.<br /><br />Also when I think of partying and success and Cuban, I think of Branson -- I should go read a story or two on him too... I love biographies, no question.

0553801473|5.0|Just finished this book and there are couple ups and downs to the story.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Fantastic writing. The chapter cliffhangers are back and will drive you nuts (in an exciting way).<br />- Characters: Martin returns to the characters that really drive the series, with each one going through an interesting plot line.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- It just ends! Don't expect a neat bow to tie up the story line when you finish.<br /><br />When I finished the book I was excited but furious that I had no more to read. The journey was so well-done though, I have no regrets about diving into this one. VERY hard to put down.
0345529057|5.0|Started reading after I watched the first season of GOT at a friend's house. Absolutely amazing series!<br /><br />I've read lots of fantasy series (J. R. R. Tolkien, T. Goodkind, R. E. Feist, R. Jordan, D. Eddings, J. Butcher, L. K. Hamilton, etc). Jim Butcher is still my favorite author, but SOIAF is extremely addicting and Martin is doing a great job of catching up as favorite. I've had the series for about a month and a half and I'm already on the 4th book... very hard to put down :)<br /><br />Only complaint... I wish the maps were more complete earlier in the series (i.e., that the early books had been revised using the maps from later in the series) and that an expanded world-map was shown... But overall, not a big deal... That's what google's for, right? :)

I was startled, no SHOCKED by the chain of events that occurred!  As I would read on, I would always be guessing what might happen next.  All through the book there were little clues but I couldn't put them all together.  And then it got me.  WOW! what a story. Very graphic. Very well told.  I'm telling everyone I know this is a must read.

0755330811|2.0|Upon coming on this book I was searching goodreads for the best ranked horror novel.  Unfortunately for me once I start reading a book I can't stop reading it.  I would really like to know what was so appealing about this book.  That being said I am not particular to genre novels.  There is really nothing special about this book except for cliche type scenes and settings, characters, and dramatic effects that are supposed to elicit response.  If you actually enjoy literature stay away from this book.

B006H5120E|5.0|Blu-Ray 3D<br /><br />Titanic in 3D as seen in IMAX 3D was like seeing the movie for the first time.  Fantastic 2D to 3D conversion, best to date.  The 3D picture was super clear and lots of depth that gave the story a whole new look.<br />I have started by reviewing the movie since the Blu-Ray 3D will be based on that presentation.  The 3D Blu-Ray presentation will be fabulous if James Cameron and 20th Century Fox follow the same great transfer that they did with Avatar.<br />I have seen, taken and have drawn 3D pictures for over 50 years.  I know great 3D over just so so 3D.<br />Titanic will be a great companion to Avatar in any 3D collection for home viewing.
B007MDB71O|5.0|Before the initial teaser well over a year ago, I had no familiarity with the Barsoomian \\"franchise\\" by Edgar Rice Burroughs (ERB), but I had heard of it. Still, something excited me about the teaser. Not so much the trailers that followed -- now known as one of the most epic movie marketing failures of all time -- but I still had really high hopes for this movie.<br /><br />It didn't let me down, at all.<br /><br />In fact, I loved it. My family loved it. I saw it multiple times in the theater and loved it more every time. Because of the movie, I bought the books here on amazon. I bought the comics -- every series I could find. I engorged myself on John Carter, the man, the hero, the legend, the gentlemen...and the incomparable Dejah Thoris. The latter being my favorite \\"Disney princess\\" of all time: gorgeous, intelligent, strong, feisty, and gorgeous. What..? Didn't you hear me the first time...?<br /><br />My son has traded his Jack Sparrow hat in for a John Carter blade. My daughters take turn as Dejah Thoris. And somehow, dear Woola is always in the game. Great times.<br /><br />Anyway, I'm impressed and continue to be so. I cannot wait for this home release -- it will be viewed several times during release week.
0374275637|5.0|In a lifetime of reading this book stands out.  Many of the books that have shifted my thinking about the world and our place in it -- the latest was Collapse by Jared Diamond -- were fast reads.  This book reads fast also, but I have been with it for two weeks.  I find myself stopping and thinking, frequently for 10 minute stretches, every few pages.  I just wish I had read the book when I was 20, unfortunately before much of the research that it reports on was done.  But, I've bought a copy for my children and will get one for each of the grandchildren when they are a little older.  If I were still at work, I'd be sure that each of my peers and the people I worked with, had read the book, or, at the very least, been exposed to its most important ideas.  It took Jared Diamond to waken my concern for our environment.  I hope to put David Kahneman's wonderful book to use in what remains of my life.  Thank you David.

B007WPM4V4|1.0|Not sure what the point of this episode was. Completely incoherent, poor storyline and the LSD scene was pure blah. Not good at all and did not advance the characters or the plot a bit.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book didn't want to put in down read it in 3 days and I had to work. Loan mine to a co-worker and the read right though it also. Glad some told be about the books.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Loved, loved these books.  I got the trilogy on my Kindle and read them all in one weekend.  Couldn't put them down.  Have recommended them to all my friends.  FYI:  I am a senior - so don't think that these books will only appeal to teens.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great book didn't want to put in down read it in 3 days and i had to work. glad some told be about the books.
B007KUFDBY|4.0|Since this got a bad rating in the box office I didn't think they would make this so early and I bought the DVD.  Now I wish I would have just waited....
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I really love it!!!!!!!!!!<br />a good way foe me to have a relax. hope to have more editions and much more interesting and difficult levels...
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|This case is perfect.  Fits snuggly.  Thin and low-profile.  VERY light weight.  Elastic strap helps keep it open or closed, depending on your needs.  And it props the kindle up nicely, when sitting on a flat surface, which is great when watching video.<br /><br />Unlike other cases we've used for past kindles, this one doesn't add any significant thickness or weight to the device, while still protecting the glass surface from getting scratched when sitting inside a bag or purse.  Exactly what we were looking for.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Catching Fire...Caught Fire! I Started reading this book and could not put it down. I could not wait to see what was going to happen next!
B007SYWFRM|4.0|not bad for younger kids. found it a bit boring. for those of you with Kindle Fire problems., while playing the game there are selections on the right side of the screen. select OPTIONS and your bottom arrow on your Kindle becomes available again allowing you to exit the game. cant believe all the bad reviews.
B005PW3OS8|4.0|My wife and I really enjoyed this movie. The story line and characters were engaging, overall it was much more exciting than we anticipated. I definitely recommend.
B003K1EYM6|3.0|Typical Apple high quality but still very expensive for what it does.  I would have purchased a cheap imitation but decided against that after reading some unfavorable reviews.
B004EPYZQC|5.0|The fast and the furious franchise has evolved, but some things stay the same: great racing/car scenes, interesting characters, ridiculous story lines, and some good action. With Fast Five, it has pushed the series to a whole new level, involving Dwayne \\"The Rock\\" Johnson, a heist plot, and lots and lots of explosions.<br /><br />During trailers, the showdown between Dwayne \\"The Rock\\" Johnson and Vin Diesel was hyped up and created a tantalizing matchup. The showdown lived up to its hype, as I enjoyed the constant tension, testosterone vs. testosterone. It was a pleasant on screen duo.<br /><br />The one character I've always enjoyed is Roman Pearce (Tyrese Gibson). Admist all of the action and tension, he always manages to provide some comedic relief.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed the combination of characters, action, and the entertaining heist. In terms of action, I enjoyed Fast Five the most in this franchise.
B001D7TW8U|3.0|I was impressed with the ease and quality of Amazon's Instant Video system. The movie, on the other hand was totally dull.
B007JRUCGO|1.0|This movie was horrible.  Even the children were not interested in waching it.  The rest of my family tried watching it (adults) and thought it was horrible also.  We let the movie run thru but no one watched it.
B007G5K066|1.0|No action, no scenery, no sex, and gratuitous confusion. Dull transfer, dull acting and dull surround sound. Waste of time.
B004LROUW2|5.0|Reading Murakami is a very different and marvelous `chore'. 1Q84 is, despite of its 900 plus pages, a gripping story that I could not put down - probably the best novel I've read in about a year. Incredible and indescribable. Highly recommended. Storytelling from a master storyteller. WOW.
0345803485|5.0|These books were hard to put down. Very easy reading and very descriptive. I think of it as the \\"adult\\" version of The Twilight Series. If it were any more erotic it would be nasty, so it was just perfect for me. My only complaint, Christian would haeve to be anything but a redhead to be as hot as described. In the movie version, I would love Matthew McHaughney (sp?) to play Christian. He could pulloff the elegance, seduction and playfullness that every page entailed. I was sorry when I had finished them because I didn't want them to end!<br /><br />Can't wait for EL James to write another...
B00005Q4ED|2.0|I was looking forward to seeing this, but the quality is so bad ( both audio and video) that it makes this waste of my money and time.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This game is cute, and very fun to pass the time. It's a lot like Mario, only for the kindle and the best part is it's free! I deffinately recommend this game.
B006Z9SP3E|3.0|While the book features some of the standard Archer twists and turns, the disappointing aspect is that it is not a stand alone epic.<br /><br />Unlike Kane and Abel and the follow-on Prodigal Daughter, the latter book could stand on its own without you having to have read the former.  In this book, although there is no need to have read the first in the trilogy, the conclusion of the book is absent.  Rather the the books ends on a \\"cliff-hanger\\" moment.<br /><br />This makes it rather obvious that the book has been written as \\"the middle child\\" in the series, and for the more cynical readers is simply a lead in to buy the third publication, when it is released.<br /><br />Not OK Mr Archer.  Your fans support you, the least you could do is write them a story that concludes, rather than an episode in a series.
B004UID2LC|5.0|I downloaded some Shelby lentz on here from youtube..works great! Shelby rocks check her out she is the next taylor swift and Carrie underwood.
B005HSL626|5.0|pretty good for a free game see other forms of this free app like for apple and stuff have no arcade or zen mode so this is pretty cool. very addictive and fun to play I really like this app
B001D8W7CW|5.0|This movie adaptation is what jettisoned Stephen King to mega fame, and the film is heartbreaking,<br />and uplifting at the beginning of the prom and well ...we all know what happens.<br />Oddly we are cheering her on in the carnage, which makes it kind of an odd revenge flick.<br />Great performances, great effects. great pacing and soundtrack and of course the shocker ending which still has a chilling effect even if you see it coming.<br />De Palma's best, one of the best horror movies of all time, this and the shining are the two best Stephen King adaptations by far, and this is the one which really is heart wrenching at the same time, so it really is the best King Movie in my view.
1419701533|5.0|These books were purchased as a gift for my granddaughter, who assurred me that she likes these books as well as \\"The Dork Diaries\\" and that they are not only for boys! I do not plan to read these books myself!

B0011UBDTK|2.0|All of the discs work well except for one which is Season 6 Part One episode 12. Does not play at all. It goes back to menu. I was kind of disappointed because that was one of my favorite episodes where Charlotte was expecting and had a miscarriage and how she dealt with the situation, etc. My advice is to watch all the episodes within the 30 day period so you can return it. I made a mistake on taking my time that it elapsed and cannot return it. I may have to purchase this episode to download it so I can be able to watch it. Bummer!!!
B0055SWM08|5.0|A fun and challenging game with a lot of different obstacles to get through and different rules to apply. Makes you think. Music is super relaxing
B007PTJOV0|5.0|simple fun to kill the time. kids can play at any age. little effort to learn point value and skills needed
B005EGXTEE|3.0|Some more background at the beginning of the book would make for easier reading, one needs to use imagination to fill in the gaps, but then perhaps that is not such a bad thing .
B007SYWFRM|5.0|my children love this app. they are constantly playing it and saying that a new baby is going to hatch. good game for all ages to occupy the time.
0439023491|1.0|I liked the 1st book a lot and I liked the beginning of this book.  Then this book amped up the unrelenting graphic violence prior to and during the games.  The first book had more periods of relief from the violence and I think it made the book more interesting as well making the death and misery a little more palatable.  The author is an incredible writer, though.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|it very cute and I love it. the only thing is I wish u could get coins and acorns faster to build your village so u don't have to buy them. but other than that its very entertaining.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|its like a prehistoric farmville. you create families and play lots of cute games. definitely a good waste of time with easy goals

B005OGYHB8|5.0|\\"Made in Stoke\\" is a great live album.  Slash and Myles Kennedy (of Alter Bridge) cover most of the material from his 2010 album \\"Slash\\", as well as some of his earlier solo work and some of his greatest hits from the Guns N Roses and Velvet Revolver years.  I can listen to Slash play \\"Night Train\\" a thousand times and never get tired of it.<br /><br />Myles Kennedy has an excellent voice and does a great job covering Slash's older material as well as the new album.  Slash is one of the greatest live guitarists EVER.  Do yourself a favor and check out this album.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I could not put this book down.  Erotic, suspenseful, and utterly compelling.  I immediately bought book 2 and 3 when I finished this book.
B0028RXHCG|5.0|It's been some time since I bought this processor, and I've been using it with Windows 7 and 8GB of Ram. This processor is extremely fast, and has never let me down. I have run many programs at once without having a problem. This processor has held up through the years and my computer still runs like new. I've run video editing software along with photoshop and many other really heavy programs that should have put a strain on the computer, but it held up and performed beautifully through all the challenges I've put it through.
B007NUP6CM|5.0|After the disappointing - if not downright awful - release of Give Me all Your Luvin' as the lead single from Madonna's 2012 album MDNA, Girl Gone Wild was a welcome change of pace, and in all truth probably should have come out first in order to spare longtime fans like myself several months of dread and anxiety, lol.<br /><br />Opening with the same spoken prayer from 1989's Act of Contrition, the track soon explodes into a powerhouse dance anthem that very nearly ventures into rave territory. Produced by Benny Benassi, it's more than a little reminiscent of his remix for Madonna's 2009 single Celebration, which in this case is a good thing. True, it isn't the most profound song you'll ever hear, and at times Madonna's vocals sound a bit wooden as if she were reading the lyrics from a page, but the lush production of it all more than makes up for any shortcomings and it is without a doubt one of the highlights of the album, at least in my opinion. Glow stick not included.<br /><br />What IS included on this CD, however, is the Justin Cognito remix of Girl Gone Wild, which is actually quite good and gives the song a completely different vibe without outshining the original. Madonna's vocals are layered over a simple tribal beat, but what really caught my attention was how the first couple \\"hey-ey-ey\\" parts are almost entirely acapella! That totally took me by surprise, but it works well and I love it. For what it's worth, I believe this mix is also featured as a bonus track on the Japanese deluxe version of MDNA.<br /><br />Despite being a huge fan and collector, I'm no sheep and can actually be quite critical when it comes to Madonna (especially in recent years) but this is one song I feel no shame in legitimately gushing over, lol. Eight or nine other remixes are already available for download, and rumor has it a physical maxi-single is slated to be released here in the US sometime in the near future, but honestly, I'll believe it when I see it. Meanwhile, this 2-track import CD single is fantastic in and of itself and definitely worth checking out if you get the opportunity.-track import CD single is fantastic in and of itself and definitely worth checking out if you get the opportunity.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this is an awesome app. my boys love ice age. and they play this game all the time. great app for giving my boys time to play.
0061438294|5.0|I just finished reading this, and am very eager to go out and people-watch just to practice observing body language. Mr. Navarro's prose is clear, concise, and engaging. The photos and real-experience vignettes (which are helpfully set aside in numbered boxes) illustrate the specific actions so well that I feel confident I will be able to remember, spot, and interpret them easily, even the ones I've never noticed before. It will be a huge help to have the added insight into others' states of mind. I am grateful to the author for consistently cautioning the reader against mistaking expressions of discomfort for evidence of deceit, and for making the point that there is no universal \\"tell\\" for lying. But on that subject, Mr. Navarro does identify patterns of body language that should send up red flags to the observer, and he also describes the circumstances under which the reader can most productively observe those patterns and use them to direct further investigation. Altogether a fast, enjoyable, and satisfyingly informative read.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|I like the variety of goals and activities. The goals are hard to get when your friends don't play also.
B0042X9L6A|5.0|I'm new to DSLR photography, and this is my first speedlight.  I bought this one based on reviews I read on the internet.  The menu is so intuitive that I barely had to refer to the instructions.  The remote trigger from the on-camera flash works well, even with the on-camera flash on it's lowest setting, and the speedlight far away.  I used it on-camera for a wedding and it was excellent, but my goal is to use it as a remote flash as often as possible, ane it performs well in both situations.  For quality, versatility and value, you can't beat the SB-700.
0062082353|5.0|Fantastic Book!!  Raw and Informative - a remarkable story about a regular guy who did the most amazing things for our Country!  Im not a Big Reader but I had a hard time trying to book the book down!<br /><br />Chris Kyle I cannot wait to get your next book; Hope you will being doing others - will be first on line to buy them!<br /><br />Continued Success!!<br /><br />Mark Fields
B005I6EVUG|5.0|Red is a great color.  I love the textured print on the cover instead of it being plain.  The quality is nice.
B005LAIGSM|5.0|You gotta love this movie.  True love does conquer all.  Major tear jerker and awesome love scenes.  You gotta buy this one.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|was getting really into the game until the timers reset to 140 hours.  I waited a few days to sedition it fixed itself and when I checked I had 0 energy and the timer was at 120 hours. HORRIBLE!!!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Read a snipit of this book a few months ago and was uninterested in it.  Saw it moving up on the top ten list so I thought I would give it a try, I am soooo glad I did! This book it great, however at the time I didnt know it was the first of three so you ca imagine my disappointment when I got to the end.  I quickly downloaded the two others and read them all in one weekend! Have read the triolgy three times now and it just keeps getting better. Must read, for sure!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|While I wasn't sure about the book, I was interested once I began to read it and of course you have to read the next two!!<br /><br />I thought it was well written, but I would be careful as a parent, choosing the age of the child who might read this. The violence is probably too much for some young people and there is a lot of killing, because it is kill or be killed.<br /><br />As an adult it was interesting to see that government hasn't evolved much into the future.
B005YZX32I|5.0|This textbook is illustrated throughout with first-class diagrams that make the task of familiarising oneself with the anatomy of the human body a real pleasure.
B006RUJST6|5.0|Thank you Abbi Glines for posting about this on Facebook, thank you Facebook for just existing so that I was able to get this recommendation, thank you Goodreads for the community that let me dive further to see what all the hype was about this book,  and thank you Colleen Hoover well, for rocking my freaking world with a book, an amazing book that kept me reading all day and night.  I devoured Slammed and Point of Retreat in one day, I've never read two books in a day; well I have now! I read and cried and not just those little sissy tears, no I freakin boohooed crocodile tears. This book is amazing! Let' me tell you why.<br /><br />Layken or Lake as she is called. I love this girl. She is complex and not your typical teenage girl. She's interesting, feisty and intriguing because she cares about her family deeply. She can be moody and frustrating but that made her so much more real to me. She's so feisty and likeable that I just loved her development as a character.  She brought so much to this story and I really enjoyed reading about her.<br /><br />Will. Oh Colleen do you ever know how to make a grown woman feel like a cougar.  When you created Will you made a real honest to goodness swoon-worthy character.  He seems flawless but he isn't, he's complex and deep and I just loved him.  His story broke my heart and the situation he is placed in. Too young he is given such a huge responsibility but he really steps up to the plate! Thank you Colleen for Will.<br /><br />The side characters are enjoyable as well. All of them. They aren't just put there without purpose, Colleen has interwoven them beautifully in this amazing story to add even more flare.<br /><br />This story is an emotional journey that I just devoured.  This book will stay with me for a long time and I am certain I will reread about Layken and Will again because it is just so good.<br /><br />I cannot stress enough how much I loved this book, not just enjoyed, LOVED.  Colleen is an amazing author andI actually feel privileged to be one of her first readers.  This book is going to be a huge hit so I highly recommend you go read this book now!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|What an amazing storyline! I may have been 50 shades of blushing but could not put this book down! Very easy read and easy to get lost in the romance w/ a twist.  Enjoy!
B001R4MEYI|5.0|It's hard to add a whole lot more after 150+ reviews of this epic masterpiece, but I've recently re-discovered this cd and I felt compelled to add another 5 stars into the mix. I like to say that what I love about Mastodon is that they are \\"heavy\\" without being \\"metal\\" and that allows them to stretch outside the usual boundaries people have with this kind of music. This stands as one of the best albums I've ever heard, regardless of genre, and it is the one that first got me into the band. Although I was a little late to the party, I am a huge fan of this band and respect what they have brought to the world of heavier music. The songwriting and production on this are top-notch throughout, and I like how they have pieced together a lot of different moods to form one long lyrical and musical story. As many others have stated, I hear a lot of classic Ozzy in the vocals - especially in \\"The Czar\\", and it even reminds me of some of that classic Randy Rhoads riffing and tone when it cranks up into the heavier parts. \\"The Last Baron\\" is a great way to end the journey - lots of great guitar playing and a fitting close to the greatness that came before it. If you are a fan, then you already know how great this one is, but if you are new to the band and want to see what all the hype is about, this is a great place to start. I've gone back and bought all their cd's and have become a big fan, but this one will always have a special place in my collection.
0446572993|4.0|Baldacci is one of my favorite author.  This book started out rather slow but ended with his usual twists and turns. Not his best but far better than many authors.
B005DKLPF6|5.0|I didn't really get into Mastodon until the classic Crack the Skye period, but I have become a big fan and I appreciate the diversity they bring to their art. Yes, this is a change from where they've been, but you also have to look at it as a natural progression - the guys are focusing on their songwriting and not letting themselves get boxed in to one stagnant style. As with most of their work, I appreciate the different moods and styles, and this one has a good mix of heavy, progressive and even some straight-ahead rock. \\"Dry Bone Valley\\" has a great chorus \\"I wish that I was still there - I want to keep on breathing\\", and \\"Thickening\\" has a little bit of Alice In Chains along with some interesting changes. The highlight for me on this one is definitely \\"The Sparrow\\" - once again a great closer from these guys with one of my all-time favorite guitar solos from Brett Hinds. To me, this is what a great guitar solo is all about - it has emotion and tells it's own story with a lot of great bends and phrasing which helps bring the whole cd to a crescendo. I like the Pink Floyd feel it has, both with the mellow and heavy parts, but that solo really stops me in my tracks every time. You can just hear those notes soaked in that fuzz that only a tube amp can give you - I can just feel those tubes getting hot and saturating those notes...bravo to Mr. Hinds for really giving us some great playing without having to resort to a lot of super-shred to impress us. As usual, there is great production quality on all of the instruments and vocals, and it sounds good whether it is blasting over your stereo or playing in your headphones.
B0078YWDHO|4.0|The movie was a great Hunter S. Thompson story starring Johnny Depp.  The witty humor and adventures throughout the movie keep you entertained, definitely going to buy this movie on Blu-Ray.  However, the review doesn't get 5 stars because the movie shifted in between HD and SD or would freeze or pixelize.  With a business class internet line to my residence, the bandwidth is more than sufficient to stream several movies at once, let alone one.
B0002EXH5O|5.0|Simply the best Megadeth album to date and my personal favorite. I can listen to this album all the way through multiple times and still go back for more its so damn good. As for the remaster, I like it I think the sound is improved as far as clarity goes but I have heard the original and I do agree with others that Dave sounds better. I recommend this album highly, its one of the best examples of thrash/speed metal ever made.
0470932139|3.0|I always buy books that relate to my specialty of food photography.  This book is good if you're intent is just being a food blogger aspiring to be better at photography.  If you're looking for a guide to become a professional photographer, this is too basic and lighting needs to go beyond what is covered.  I see too many photographers just using natural light and this is ok, but they need a breakdown of what certain light modifications can do to the subject and how it can help make it beyond a snapshot.  The photographic lighting show in some samples use an on-camera flash bounced off a reflector.  This is too amateur.  I would like to see professional lighting equipment such as Profoto strobes using soft boxes.  Not saying this is the only way to approach a project, but it would take this to a higher level for those looking for \\"studio\\" setups that allow the photographer to create a certain quality of light visualized for the subject.  A photographer needs to create a certain light even if it's not there.<br /><br />I was drawn to the book because I wanted to learn more about the styling end of things but I find the author's style a bit repeated or perhaps formula.  Perhaps preference but still enough info worthwhile to pick up the book.
0307959856|3.0|This is not the great P.D. James' best work. I have read all the rest of her mystery novels. In my view, she is better off not trying to imitate Jane Austen, which this book tries to do and in which it doesn't succeed. At her own genre she is without peer, although Elizabeth George comes close. If you like Jane Austen and P.D. James, you may enjoy the book.
B006R1T40I|4.0|Lotza funk and blues..mostly smooth and mellow. Great vocals via Miss Bonnie! Still studying the effort...<br />\\"Standing In The Doorway\\" is a tune you won't hear on the radio, but you will go back to anytime your mood hits - reflection!<br /><br />Recommended for a complete music collection of anything Mellow-Rock! Can seamlessly break up a heavy play list without ruing your party's mood!
B007549YM4|5.0|The acting was pretty damn good. I really don't understand why some of you people are giving this 1 star when this was an entertaining, a little disturbing at times but under the circumstances i think most of us would end up going through similar horrors if we were holed up in a basement after being nucleared bombed to hell and stuck with a bunch of strangers with little water n food. At the end of the day we're all animals and once our everyday comforts are taken away from us, it's all about survival of the fittest. Most of the time there's no morality left when it comes to surviving. Forget these morons who can't take grit and realism and pick this one up.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|This book is probably every man/woman's sexual fantasies combined into a novel series. There's very little dialogue but enough for it to have some sort of a story line. This is just sex sex sex. Although some parts of it are cheesy, it's understandable coming from an \\"innocent\\" view (character: anastasia)... the rest is pretty hott! heard they were already signing for a movie... not sure how they can make this into a movie without it being considered a porno =)
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|this bok is amazing and that is coming froma 13 year old boy who hadnt even heard about this untill about a week ago when i bought the kindle iam writing this with from someone and this book was on it<br /><br />though sometimes the wordung was a little confusing but only 1-2 and that isnt bad and there is no way this book deserves less than a five star rating anyone who has rated this lees thaan  five stars or who does in the future didnt take the time to understand and absorb the information
1400069289|5.0|It is said that we are all creatures of habit, and if there was any doubt that's true, Charles Duhigg's book is all the proof you will need.  His idea is simple; our lives are made up of all of our little habits, from brushing our teeth to not going to the gym in the morning.  We do the things we do because we have trained ourselves to behave that way, unthinking in our actions. Once you've done the same thing a number of times your brain becomes wired to follow the same path.  However, we are not bound by these habits, and difficult thought it may be, we can change our habits. It's all about the cycles of cue (what sets a habit in motion), routine (what you do when the cue occurs), and reward (the expected satisfaction you get when you've completed the routine).  By recognizing this pattern and altering it to get the desired result we change our habits.  The process isn't easy, and it will take effort, but knowing is half the battle, and once you start repeating your desired action enough a new, and better, habit will be formed.<br /><br />The simplistic summary above just begins to touch the surface of Mr. Duhigg's powerful and interesting book.  The book covers not only the habits of individuals, but also of organizations, and society.  There are many fascinating studies, stories, and examples of successfully changed habits both large and small in the book to illustrate all of his points.  The section that deals with how our minds work and are wired, was especially engaging to me.<br /><br />Everything is explained in plain language, so you don't have to be a scientist to follow it.  Better still, lots of great illustrations are scattered through the book, to assist in the understanding of the concepts.<br /><br />All in all...a fun and fascinating read, that can also change your life.

B007PKOKTK|5.0|This is too adorable, and my husband, sons and I couldn't stop laughing. Not to mention it's nice to find a film without too much potty humor that seems to get thrown into the little kids movies. OK, so the Easter Bunny poops jelly-beans, but that's IT. (And that made the kids laugh SO hard.) Russell Brand as the voice of the Easter Bunny is  hilarious, and James Marsden as the hapless guy who just wants the approval from his father he never got is so sweet and funny too, as well as Kaley Cuoco with those big-eyed faces she can make when she's surprised.<br /><br />The candy factory, reminiscent of Willy Wonka, the egg sleigh pulled by hundreds of little chickies--- awesome. And the under-arching story with an actual MORAL... nice. I can't recommend this highly enough, and I'm shocked at all the flak it's gotten. Be sure, however, to watch past the end of the credits for a hilarious bonus scene between E.B. and Fred...

1419702238|4.0|my kids and I have enjoyed the Wimpy Kid series.  This one is no different.  This story, being set in the winter, brought back some great memories of some of my youth in the midWest.<br /><br />While reading aloud, I often had to stop and compose myself as I was laughing too hard to continue.  Greg is a silly kid with some pretty typical experiences of growing up (at least they seem typical to me).<br /><br />While he's not necessarily the best role model for our kids, his ideas, problems, and interactions with friends and family provide some humor and good discussion in our family.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Unvarnished truth about the seals expressed vividly. Our hero was too macho and enjoyed killing too much, but he certainly performed exceedingly well at what he was trained to do . . . Action, Action, Action!
B005OKTPKC|3.0|A storey that does not deviate from its theme of a legal case and the legal people involved. I thought it took rther a long time to tell the storey.
0307592731|5.0|I was so impressed with how Ms Strayed combined her past with her present on the trail. It could have used a bit more editing. But it really was amazingly honest and authentic. I only wish she had written it sooner since the events are more than 17 yrs ago.

0316069353|5.0|OK folks if you read for pleasure, this review is for you. If, however, you are a critic and read to publish, then I may not appeal to you. I enjoy M. Connelly's work. His creativity takes boredom out of my day and I prefer reading, kindle or whatever, above any TV. The latest Haller is now ready to move, partially, from the Lincoln to an office and actually takes on an associate. LAPD has \\"zeroed\\" on his civil client and charges her with murder. So Haller decides to once again to become defense in lieu of his new found civil docket. I read the book in 2 days, often putting it aside to \\"savor\\" the read. Do not allow the naysayers to keep you from reading this book. Nothing seems contrived to me and the pace is fast. Connelly has talent. Dont try to assign a value. Just read the book and enjoy as I did. The court action is thrilling to me. My Mom worked in courts for >30yrs and she enjoyed her work. She would enjoy the book.
B004CRR9G0|5.0|This is a awesome movie for all fans of Studio Ghibli animation.The visuals are breath taking for the blue-ray & the cast in amazing. One of Legendary Hayao Miyazaki best masterpieces!!! Also one if my favorites. If u fall in love with movie check out his other work Studio Ghibli won't disappoint.
0439023513|2.0|(The first part is spoiler free)<br />I have never written a review before but decided to because I felt so strongly about the end of this series. For those who haven't read it yet save your time and stop when you finish Catching Fire(the sloppy ending is a toned down preview of what's to come in Mockingjay)<br />I fell head over heals in love with the first and second books. I finished both in one weekend and raved about them to everyone I knew.<br />Before I read Mockingjay I read a few reviews with no spoilers and chalked it up to be that people were just unhappy bc they wanted a happy ending. That is NOT why I did not like the book. I felt it lacked the substance, emotion, and character development that the first two books had. I would not have minded if the incidents played out in the same exact way if they were not so poorly written.<br /><br />SPOILERS do not read on if you have not read yet...<br />*<br />*<br />*<br />*<br />*<br />*<br />*<br />*<br /><br />Saving Prim was the reason that Katniss went into the hunger games in the first place. The way her death was written was a disgrace. I didn't even know she died until it was straight out stated. You'd think after how heartfelt Rues death was, Prim would get the same respect and more. It was confusing and I felt nothing reading it. The same goes for when Finnick was so easily killed in 2 seconds. I was at least expecting a reaction from Annie. I was wrong.<br />The way the Peeta and Gale situation wrapped up was an extreme cop out. She went back and forth throughout the whole series and then didn't have to choose? She let Gale go that easily? What would have happened if Gale came back to district 12? Should I even talk about the fact that all we got was a recap on when the Capitol finally fell?<br />I really can go on and on about my disappointments in the way the story wrapped up. My issues were not with the actual events but the way the writer explained them(or didn't explain them I should say.) I understood going into it that it wasn't a happy story. I understood people needed to die. The start of the series captivated the reader and laid a strong foundation.  Mockingjay delivered an ending that felt very rushed. The author could have done so much with what she started and instead left the reader feeling completely unsatisfied. I honestly felt like a different person was writing this.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|loads of fun not just for kids either. I would recommend this game for anyone. I like how you don't have to actually buy stuff to play it. if you run out of energy you can wait for more!
1591843790|3.0|Guy Kawasaki is the legendary evangelist behind Apple's original rise to fame, as well as a seasoned Silicon Valley executive.  In this book, Guy tackles the sticky issue of creating \\"enchantment\\": the feelings aroused by products from BMW, Apple, Sephora, Nike and Zappos.  Written as a sales and marketing book, Guy's advice takes the reader through the \\"three pillars of enchantment\\":<br /><br />1. Be likeable<br />2. Be trustworthy<br />3. Have a great cause<br /><br />By being a technology expert, Guy is heavily invested in social media and describes in detail how to leverage new media to your advantage.  Guy also wisely peppers other's stories in his narrative to show how various points of his have been successful with others in real, live situations.<br /><br />The weakness of this book is that Guy spends far too much time on points one and two, and not nearly enough on the third.  The topics of \\"likeability\\" and \\"trust\\" have been written on ad nauseum, and there really is little need for Guy to explain, for example, how to shake hands correctly.<br /><br />In the end, it is worth the read, but not nearly as \\"enchanting\\" as I would have hoped.

B006OB3K56|1.0|I purchased this movie with the understanding that it came with a digital copy.  On Tuesday when I received it I couldn't get iTunes to recognize the disc so I called Fox.  They took my information and said that they would get back to me.  On Friday I still hadn't heard from them so I called again.  I was told that no one could access the iTunes copy and that they were working on it. (The autoplay for the entire disc does not work properly on the Mac and two Windows PCs that I tried.)  Then today I received an e-mail:<br /><br />------------------------<br />Dear Valued Customer,<br /><br />Thank you for your email. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience but unfortunately, Fox is not able to offer an iTunes Digital Copy for Shame. The digital copy can be transferred to a compatible Android device or a Windows PlaysForSure-compatible PC or portable media player.<br />Should you have any additional questions, please do not hesitate to contact us at 888 223 4369 between 8:00 am to 5:00 pm PST and a Customer Care representative will be more than happy to assist you.<br /><br />Thank you,<br />Customer Care<br />------------------------<br /><br />Now I don't care what kind of digital copy they want to give out but it should be crystal clear when I'm buying this that it only works for those people who have android phones - and that was not clear from the description here or anywhere else on the internet.  (The box also looked just like all my iTunes digital copies as well.)  I check the digital copy information before I buy because I don't like getting stuck with Ultraviolet copies either.  And I really don't appreciate Fox dangling me on for a week when they obviously never intended to give an iTunes copy.  I am returning this as defective and I will wait until after Fox movies are released (and reviewed) to purchase them in the future.
B007VPLNGW|5.0|fun and entertaining. I can slap my kindle on my brother's lap and he won't bug me for hours.It's Great
B0031R5K72|5.0|An excellent book, full of wonderfull human moments, and from an unexpected perspective. Death tells a story. It reminded me of the books by Kurt Vonnegut. Some darkness, some light and some beauty all mixed together with a splash of humour. Highly reccommended.

0553801473|1.0|Long, miserable slog through a medieval fantasy soap opera.  I like Martin's writing style, but nothing nice ever happens, and I wish I had never picked up the first book.  It reminds me of a brief and embarrassing fling I had with a guy in college.  I kept hanging out with him, thinking something good would happen because he was smart and sort of good looking, but overall it just made me feel bad.  Like Meth for readers.  I keep coming back to it, even though I know it will hurt me.<br /><br />These books just make me feel bad.  The misogyny is nearly unbearable.  The sex is usually horrific (the majority being rape, incest, prostitution, and pedophilia). The most I can hope for is that something bad happens to a character I don't like because at least there is that grim satisfaction of having a horrifically, evil character become disemboweled, decapitated, hung, burned, humiliated, mutilated, or otherwise writhing in some kind of agony.  Schadenfreude at its best. Of course this happens even to the characters I do like. Martin went all Julius Caesar on my favorite character in this particular book--Et tu brothers. Plus there are all of the extraneous characters that don't actually further the plot in any meaningful way--I skim a good portion of the books. They are just way, way too long.  I think Martin loves every word, every character, every syllable. It gets a little narcissistic.  staring at that mirror too long isn't going to do anyone any good.<br /><br />It's like reading 5,000 pages of \\"Of Mice and Men.\\" Steinbeck mercifully kept it under 200 pages to put us and his characters out of misery.  That and it kept him from repeating his images ad nauseam.  If I hear about any more pissed in small clothes, charred rats leaking blood and grease, or the size and color of any more nipples it will be too soon.  Right now the most I can hope for for Westeros and the other miserable lands on this world is that a giant meteor will come down from the sky and destroy the whole planet--a quick merciful end for us all.  Out of the hundreds of characters in the book, I think there are only two left who I actually like, and one of them is an assassin. Save yourself; don't get drawn into this reeking bog of a series--reeking rhymes with freaking waste of time.  The others take them all.whole planet--a quick merciful end for us all.

B007PS0DTI|3.0|Though the first two installments were short on story line and heavy on action, the thrd movie was even more so. There is really no further character development for Selene and the whole movie followed the formula: Action >> Segway >> Action >> Segway >> Action >> Inadequate Conclusion...<br /><br />I recommend waiting for the price to drop as this is not worth the whole $12 to purchase and isn't worth the probable $3.99 to rent.
B003KK6GOQ|5.0|I was amazed by this book. The style of written letters is very different to any other story. I felt as if I knew the characters from how well they were described in the book.<br /><br />The book also made myself think about what was suffered during the war and how many different people were affected in different ways.

030758836X|5.0|When Nick's wife Amy disappears on the day of their fifth anniversary, the police automatically assume he's to blame. After all, the evidence points to him . . . and his constant lies don't help his case either. But is Nick as bad as he appears? And maybe Amy wasn't the sweet, doting wife she seemed to be either. If you are looking for a well-written, well-plotted mystery/thriller with some interesting twists and turns, this is the book for you.

B004SUWR2C|4.0|This is put together very well. It plays just like the card game. You can play against the AI or with friends or with friends and the AI. Four stars because the actual size of the file on the Kindle Fire is 80 MB which is 20 times what is stated in the description which is typical of Gameloft games.
B0063IH60K|5.0|love this game, i play at least 5 games of solitaire each night, and the interface mobilityware created for playing this game is absolutely phenominal. I hpe everyone chooses this app, because it is definitely worth playing, whether you're a new player,  or an experienced veteran

B004JZBGWI|5.0|If you are a checklist person, or consider yourself to have minor OCD, this is the app for you. It's highly intuitive. I take it to work to use the checklist feature, and just reset it each day. I have my daily schedule on it, my workout, my passwords list for reference, and anything else I don't want to forget that I do routinely. Excellent, excellent app. Great in its simplicity. I can't believe it was a free download (sssshhhh, don't tell).
B0071DJZZA|4.0|Really well written book. The hype stated that it targeted the same audience as the Twilight series. So wrong. This book is much better written, targets a wider age group and is stimulating enough to want to turn the pages. I have also seen the movie and, although enjoyable, the book is far superior.
B0055SWM08|5.0|very fun. think about the ice sliding puzzles from Victory Road in Pokemon Red/Blue. then they add extra dimensions to those puzzles
0345803485|1.0|I'm sorry, but I just don't get the hype over this book. In my opinion it is not very well written, the story drags in way too many places, the characters have no depth, and the sex was not hot... it was actually kind of boring.<br /><br />A lot of times with fiction novels you have to suspend your belief a little bit, but with this novel the book was totally unbelievable. The plot line didn't make sense at certain points, and the characters were completely unbelievable. There was also this weird element to the novel where the characters were supposed to be American twenty-something's, but they spoke like they were British. I understand that the author is British, but so many times during the novel I kept thinking that no one born and raised in the U.S. would say things or phrase things the way the characters did.<br /><br />All in all, I just did not enjoy this book whatsoever; although I had high hopes because of all of the rave reviews the novel has received. I had to force myself to finish the book. I kept thinking that maybe I was missing something and the story would turn and get enormously better. Too bad that never happened.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|These games are very easy to play. Its a great way to past the time. My daughter also loves the game. If you give the a bad review then you don't love simple games.
B006YTYIXG|3.0|One of soulfly's better releases. They kind of lost me after the first few records. After the first record, the next few follow up records were not all that great. I heard one of the songs off enslaved and it got me interested in soulfly again. If you like the first soulfly, i would recommend enslaved and dark ages as well.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This was a very captivating book!  I believe that every women has a Christian Grey they can relate to.  I haven't read a book that was so difficult to put down.  There just wasn't an easy stopping place.  In fact, my suggestion is to have the second book downloaded so that when you finish the first you can go right into the next.  I've finished them all and just can't wait for the new one to hit stands.
B006ISJQ1W|5.0|The Rum Dairy is a brisk tale of greed at the expense of others,a modern Robin Hood tale of a journalist who tries to speak with his pen for the poor of Peurto Rico. It was great to see Johnny Depp in something besides a Pirate Movie and the rest of the cast was superb esp. Amber Heard a siren who Depp's character falls head over heels in love with. Giovanni Ribisi and Michael Rispoli have great chemistry with Depp here as cohorts whom the danger of San Juan hold adventure and life lessons as they weave their way through this existence we call life. Aaron Eckhart is great as a shady business man with whom Depp's charecter falls out of favor and then has to tie up loose ends of a shady business deal that is exposed, a deal so lucrative that people will have to die for it to remain intact.<br />This movie has a great story that seems to move along with out boring you.
B006WQLH7G|5.0|Another excellent Avast product. I have been using their desktop software for several years and have recommended it to all my friends. I also bought the upgrade desktop package because I liked the free one so much.
B007M458CW|5.0|Outstanding piece of work. Where does Auerbach find the time -- and creativity -- to keep putting out all of this awesome music (lots of side projects). All while bringing the Keys to national fame. He is a true throwback and a perfect person to back up the man who influenced so much of his sound. Dr. John is fabulous as usual!<br /><br />This album should receive a lot of accolades this year -- and not just in the collaborative category.<br /><br />Dr. John tells some great, and personal, stories. Glad Auerbach could bring that out of him. Auerbach's grooves are fantastic and a perfect backdrop for the seasoned, growling voice of the Doctor.<br /><br />OF NOTE: Auerbach said in an interview that the guitar solo at the end of Getaway is some of his best playing -- ever. That's saying a lot. Enjoy people!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Characters really cute. Easy game for children to play.  Could use more mini games. We have to keep playing to see all the new habitats.
0545265355|5.0|The Hunger Games trilogy - WOW! Purchased the box set after watching the first film and i can honestly say, the film kept true to the book (which is a rarety these days)<br /><br />I finished The Hunger Games within one day, could not put it down! Catching Fire if anything is even more amazing than The Hunger Games and cannot wait for that film to be released, it is non-stop greatness at its best!<br /><br />This is the first time in a really long time that i have had the chance to read something so amazing that i could not put down! Definately worth a read by all, Suzanne Collins, you are an amazing writer and have an exceptional imagination to  conjure such a unique read. Well done!
0553386794|5.0|I have all five volumes of a song of ice and fire audio books on my ipod and I love them all. I put them all on one play list and the play list was over eight days long, so they are very, very long. If you don't like long books this series is not for you, if you have hours and hours of driving and/or working and would like to listen to a great story to pass the time these books might be for you. It is like no story I ever listened to before because the number of people and places in the story, the amount of detail about everything in the stoy, and the lack of a main character, there are main people in the story but you never know when one is going to die, it is almost like a very long history lesson from a parallel universe than a story following a few main characters. All the way from the start to where the stoy is now I never know what is going to happen, one minute I am laughing, a few hours later I am crying, and then later I am screaming in anger, it is a great ride! Like I said before they are long, I would never have time to read them, only people who read really fast should read them because if you are a slow reader by the time you finish you will forget what happens in the begining, reading puts me to sleep so I have listen to them over and over again and pick up on something new every time. I like all five volumes equally I think of them as one very long story.
B00571F26Y|5.0|I found this books very informative and useful.  I put the information to use immediately and found it effective.  I highly recommend it.

0385737955|4.0|Whoa, well Mr. Dashner did a great job with the ending of this book. I'm ferociously reading through the second book now and I can't wait to discover how it all unveils.<br /><br />The Maze Runner is a story set in a Post-Apocalyptic future (which not disclosed until the very end of the book). The main character, Thomas is dropped on a piece of land; Called The Glade. It is gated by huge stone walls with doors leading to a maze. Thomas learns that the only people that live in The Glade are boys, ranging in age from 12-17, and they call themselves Gladers. Thomas' memory is erased, and the only thing he remembers is his name. The story develops as The Gladers and Thomas try to solve The Maze, but things change when a girl is dropped in The Glade and warns Thomas that things will change. The end is coming.<br /><br />The energy in this book is spectacular. James Dashner creates a slang that the Gladers use, which is very entertaining to learn. The kids have assigned roles in The Glade, so that there is harmony and order. There is a punishment for the boys that don't respect the rules. There are monsters that hide in the maze which are described so well, it makes your skin crawl just to imagine it. There is a hint of magic, when Thomas discovers he has a gift.<br /><br />I will recommend this book to anyone and everyone that is trying to find a good book like The Hunger Games. Also to anyone who is trying to find a good YA read with a male lead, which I haven't found since I read Harry Potter.<br /><br />Thanks! Happy Readings<br /><br />*check my blog for more book reviews--> [...]
B005LAIH54|3.0|Only two years have passed since &#34;Clash of the Titans.&#34; I was not much impressed with the film's dull story and weak acting, except that of Liam Neeson playing Zeus. Visuals were pretty good (I didn't see the film in 3D) though it lacked the imagination of Ray Harryhausen. Now its sequel &#34;Wrath of the Titans&#34; arrives, which is neither better nor worse than &#34;Clash,&#34; visually or story-wise.  Sam Worthington is back as demi-god warrior Perseus, now a father of a ten-year-old son Helius (John Bell). This time Perseus, together with Queen Andromeda (Rosamund Pike), sets out to rescue the captive Zeus and save the world from the Titans. I don't know how they could capture the almighty god. Also, sorry if I am wrong, but I think I saw only one Titan. Well, I think you see my point. Storytelling is not the strength of &#34;Wrath of the Titans,&#34; just like its predecessor.  For the sequel to &#34;Clash of the Titans,&#34; Jonathan Liebesman (whose previous work was an effect-ridden alien invasion action &#34;Battle Los Angeles&#34;) takes up the director's helm. &#34;Wrath of the Titans&#34; looks more like a series of computer graphic combat sequences than an adventure tale based on Greek mythology. It feels like a video game, where a hero defeats his opponent(s) and proceeds to the next battle. Veterans like Ralph Fiennes, Danny Huston, Liam Neeson and Bill Nighy appear, but their roles are mostly forgettable.  Perhaps the best part of the film is the dazzling effects of a gigantic lava dripping Titan. The rest of the film is about the uninteresting hero's endless battles.

0345803485|1.0|I was a bit dissapointed as I heard many cheers about the trilogy. They were supposed to be erotic and sort of romantic. However... as I finished them, I am not sure if it was more about the many many ways to spend money and what to do with your wealth than with the character development of romance of Christian & Ana. The books were a bit bland and perhaps it suffices to say that the best part of the books is E.L. James' taste in cars (R8)

HOWEVER, when I install it on my new Droid Turbo and try to run it, all I get is the first screen coming up, then an &#34;Internal Service Failure: An internal error occurred. This can be caused by a lack of network connectivity....&#34;  Uh, really? I have full network and LTE access; I have no problems whatsoever getting out to any site and all my other apps have no problem. Why this one? At first I got a 'Downloading...' message in the top drawer saying AccuWeather was downloading something - that finished successfully. But still AccuWeather will not load - same internal error.

055357342X|5.0|I have all five volumes of a song of ice and fire audio books on my ipod and I love them all. I put them all on one play list and the play list was over eight days long, so they are very, very long. If you don't like long books this series is not for you, if you have hours and hours of driving and/or working and would like to listen to a great story to pass the time these books might be for you. It is like no story I ever listened to before because the number of people and places in the story, the amount of detail about everything in the stoy, and the lack of a main character, there are main people in the story but you never know when one is going to die, it is almost like a very long history lesson from a parallel universe than a story following a few main characters. All the way from the start to where the stoy is now I never know what is going to happen, one minute I am laughing, a few hours later I am crying, and then later I am screaming in anger, it is a great ride! Like I said before they are long, I would never have time to read them, only people who read really fast should read them because if you are a slow reader by the time you finish you will forget what happens in the begining, reading puts me to sleep so I have listen to them over and over again and pick up on something new every time. I like all five volumes equally I think of them as one very long story.
B007JNWQZS|1.0|Do not buy this thinking it's the whole bloody affair! The reviewer up top says it's a great way to view both films, but at the end of the day you still have 2 discs! The Whole Bloody Affair is supposed to have a new anime sequence attached, the crazy 88 black and white scene in color etc. So, if you want to buy this don't! You're better off buy them separately off amazon USED! Not sure if the Whole bloody Affair is still coming out, but it was screened last year (march/april) in cali by Tarantino. I don't know what the hold up is!

B007CGLRWA|5.0|I come from a long line of teachers, so I came into this movie thinking it would just be another inner city school teacher changes the world for one classroom/school, this movie is so much more than that. This is quite possibly Adrian Brody's best work ever, and the over all tone, scripting, acting, and cinematography were simply excellent. If this doesn't win an Oscar I will be really surprised. I don't want to give anything away, but watch this movie, you won't be disappointed, it makes you think, it makes you feel, and most importantly it might actually teach you something.<br /><br />My wife feels more or less the same, but she felt that it started a little slow, but she felt that it did pick up and was overall very pleased with the movie as well. Well worth the 7 bucks.
0062112430|4.0|Delirium is the first book in the dystopian novel series by Lauren Oliver. In Delirium, it is years into the future and love is illegal and is considered to be a disease. When a male and female reach the age of 18, it is required by law that a procedure is performed to remove the emotion of love from your brain. This book makes you think of the motions that love makes you do. The term lovesick comes to mind. And yes love can make you do crazy things. Have crazy thoughts. I've always been a strong believer that you are allowed to have whatever feelings you desire, for it's your actions that you are accounted for. It how you handle your feelings. That's what matters.<br /><br />The main character in the series is a 17 year old girl named Lena who is just a few months shy of receiving the procedure. When we first meet Lena she is pretty much counting down the days until her procedure. She has had some pretty hardships in her life. Her father died of cancer when she was very young, and her mother committed suicide after having 3 failed procedures for the cure. The cure is what they call the love removing procedure. Lena was raised by her aunt Carol, who was her mother's sister.<br /><br />If I lost the ability to love, there is no doubt I'd be a different person. A mother's love is one the most precious things. The idea of raising children without love frightens me. It's interesting to see how Lena's aunt who is cured treats Lena and her own children. Lena's younger cousin Grace does not speak at all. Carol pretty much has cast Grace aside and just tells everyone that she's dumb. It's clear that the lack of love in her life is one of the factors in Grace's behavior.<br /><br />Most dystopian novels deal with the actions of the government, and Delirium makes me wonder how far the government could realistically make things. In Delirium big brother is pretty much watching you at all times. The government decides everything for you. From your job to who you are paired to marry. Marriage pairings remind me of arranged marriages. I despise arrange marriages. No freedom. No choice. I'm a romantic. I personally could never live in this world.<br /><br />Very early on in the book Lena meets Alex. From the first moment they meet, she is pretty much intrigued by him. Lena has not had much contact with boys because the government forbids uncured males and females from talking to each other outside of their family. Boys and girls go to separate schools. Alex pretty much captivates Lena. I believe a part of it is the fact that she knows that what she's doing is considered to be wrong. But mostly I think it's just a part of growing up. It reminded me of the feelings you have for your first crush. When you realize that boys aren't icky and don't have cooties. When Lena meets a transformation starts to happen. The reader really gets to see her start to grow into a women.<br /><br />One of the things I enjoyed the most about this book was the steady flow. Everything went at a nice pace, and was really well written. I didn't find any parts to drag on, or move too quickly. Lena's transformation was pretty gradual and it was a joy to read. The climax of the book had my heart racing. I am also extremely glad that the next book in the series Pandemonium is already out. I cannot wait to read it.rry.

B0018CMJSU|5.0|This is a great purchase putting together all the 3 movies. The best part is hearing from the Director and getting all the inside backstories of how he almost didn't get to direct. Coppola is interesting and entertaining. A perfect gift for anyone!

B0071LLHGC|5.0|Because of the setting, this may be the best mixxed of all the band's early, live CDs. The Ludlow Garage comes close but if you like to know what is being played by Duane & what is being played by Dickie as I do, this is a must have. I agree that some songs aren't as \\"firey\\" as some other shows but that's the Yin & the Yang. This may not be around for long so get it now if you wanna hear these guys at their best.
0316077054|5.0|If you have NOT read BEAUTIFUL CREATURES please read with caution. There is some spoilers that were unavoidable. Proceed with caution . . .<br /><br />I found BEAUTIFUL CREATURES to be good but slow. Not the case here. Ethan annoyed me in the beginning. He was just so...needy? He was like the over protective boyfriend all girls try to avoid. Which really disappointed me because I didn't want to see him like that. He makes up for it, he really does.<br /><br />Lena is beating herself up over Macon's death. Ethan has no idea why she is, it's not like it was her fault, right? Not that he could remember most of what happened that night but how could she possibly blame herself? She does, though, and she's completely losing herself in the process. If that wasn't bad enough, she's pushing Ethan away and running off with this strange guy, John Breed, who appears to be an Incubus but. . . not? Not only is she hanging around with this Harley riding bad boy, but also her dark Caster cousin, Ridley. That sounds like it has trouble written all over it.<br /><br />We're introduced to a new girl with a beautiful British accent who's come to Gaitlin as a Keeper-in-training. She's beautiful, intelligent and exactly like Marion, which is why Link calls her MJ, which is short for Marion Junior. There is more to her than meets the eye...<br /><br />Not only do I love the characters in this series but this story was so amazing. There seriously was never a dull moment. Ethan was on a non-stop journey this entire book and we know it's far from over, same goes for Lena. Heck, same goes for basically everyone in Gaitlin! Lena was still trying to figure out if she wanted to be light or dark - which half of her family she wanted to kill. That's not an easy task, especially for a sixteen year old girl. She makes her decision in the end...but don't think I'm going to spoil that for you<br /><br />Definitely check out this series. I can't wait to read the next book, BEAUTIFUL CHAOS. From what I hear too, filming just started for the film adaptation of BEAUTIFUL CREATURES in New Orleans. Amazing book and even better cast, I really cannot wait to see this book brought to life. So, jump on board this train before this series really takes off come February 2013.hear too, filming just started for the film adaptation of BEAUTIFUL CREATURES in New Orleans.

B005SFR7YE|5.0|What a beautiful and profound production of the 25th Anniversary of Phantom of Opera at the prestigeous Royal Albert Hall in London. We had the unbelievable opportunity to see the original cast members after the show and the composer as well. The DVD is well worth the few dollars to see and hear from all the best singers in the world. I had only wished that JOHN BARROWMAN would have reprised his role as RAUL. He was the singer who inspired me to buy this DVD because of his exciting, unusual, and melodic voice. Next time, they need to have him sing!
0439023521|3.0|While the story did keep my attention, I found it to be way too predictable. The suspense is based in whether the main character lives or dies, which is fairly obvious to the objective reader. It would hardly be a popular series if the main character died a grizzly death. Being jerked back and forth in the emotional rollercoaster of \\"Oh my God! We're all going to die!\\" and \\"I think I'm falling in love,\\" is repetitive and tiresome. The ending was definitely contrived to entice you into buying the second book, rather than being written with concern for telling the story. It felt like the 5:00 teaser for the 6:00 news.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Didn't find this book erotic, just boring...Afraid I won't be buying the sequels....save yourself some money and pass this one by.......
0307946711|4.0|Despite reading low reviews and knowing before hand it wasn't the typical love-story, say; Nicholas Spark's kind of reading, I still gave this book a go and do not regretted. Will admit at first it was a little hard to get into, Emma's character is so much more likable than Dexter, and yet, all the while I was indeed waiting for the time they would just get together. I was pleased enough it did not happen overnight; I was okay to see them making mistakes and being with the wrong people, because guess what? That happens in life. The reading was frustrating at times because things just kept getting in the way of them -sometimes for a reason, sometimes not. But still, as 'friends', or whatever they were throughout the 20years, it was a very much enjoyable reading to see those two characters growing up to be not exactly the people they envisioned to be back in the 80s but for the contrary, the people their own decisions (good and bad) shaped them to be.<br />The writing in this book is all sorts of amazing, it's funny, and sad, and ironic and frustrating all at the same time. I cried and laughed and told myself all throughout the read how much I hated reading it because I simply couldn't put it down.<br />All in all, it is a book I will read again. The characters are not perfect, they make mistakes and screw up more than one would want them, and yet they stay real for the better part of the book. The ups and lows in life, I specially enjoyed getting to live that with the characters. It can be relatable at times which I find an extra point to the book.<br /><br />And to those who put this book as the \\"perfect girl waiting forever for the screwed up guy to reform himself and choose her\\" I just have to say I do not agree. I don't believe Emma waited around for Dexter; I think it's safe to say she loved him from the early chapters because of this person he was when he was with her --not exactly all the time. I think they did bring each other's best; perhaps I'm wrong but whatever. She went on with her life all the while keeping Dexter as her best friend. Probably not a healthy relationship, but what are you gonna do? The heart wants what the heart wants :) She was with Ian, her school's headmaster, and the lovely french guy. I don't think she waited around for Dex as some people put it. She lived her life just as Dexter did, and when the person he became was too much for her to handle and try to \\"save\\", she was brave enough to tell him goodbye.<br /><br />Eventually they made up and in a way, in my opinion, did save one another. Dexter needed someone to keep him grounded and good, Emma needed someone to remind her she was good enough and beautiful and smart and was able to do as she wanted.<br /><br />A tragic ending that got me bawling even when I knew it was coming (someone spoiled it for me) and even when I still don't understand it, (really? Why it had to happen?!) the ending itself was what got me thinking days after I was done with the book; how sometimes we are stupid and silly and miss out on opportunities to be with the people we really want to be because of vanity or excuses or whatever.<br /><br />A book worth reading in my opinion. An easy read yet complex in a lot of senses. England and the whole European atmosphere was refreshing and captivating. Good read ! Highly recommended :)

0525478817|5.0|I'm going to keep this rather short and simple as my back is killing me and I need to lay down, but having just finished the book, I am obligated towards recommending it. I'm not going to summarize the story as that's in the description, you're able to read the first chapter on Amazon for free, John promotes the book above, and, of course, the many readers here have already reviewed and laid it out for you. The progression of this book was so well-done, that I couldn't put it down. Heck, I took it with me to class to read this morning (bad, I know, but this professor is completely book-oriented and I'm just there for the attendance). I immediately took a liking to most of the characters introduced, appreciating their knowledge and backstory to their way of speaking or expressing themselves. With quite a few books I've come across, the author tends to \\"show off\\" his/her vocabulary, and they have every right to, they've earned their publication, their hard work, their knowledge on the language being quite impressive. But with that, it's difficult to imagine how...in reality, a boy of poverty struggling to get by to speak so adequately. If there is a believable way to explain such grammar, then I'm all ears, or in this case, all eyes. Greene accomplishes this, as we get a good sense of background and standing with the characters. I know this seems like a minor quirk with books being narrated as such, but nevertheless, I feel that I must point it out.<br /><br />Anyway, the character development, particularly of the main character, Hazel, has truly touched me. Her struggle, her rather realistic views, her ways of coping with her complications, it's all so inspiring. And not the \\"inspiring\\" in a sense that, \\"hey, this girl is strong and living and getting by, battling cancer and everything!\\" but more-so in the sense that the book, or rather, Hazel's and a few other characters, see themselves and see the world, no, the universe, in such a substantial and unique way. Theirpaths, their lives, takes many turns, each with valuable lessons and growth. In short, I thoroughly enjoyed how \\"real\\" these characters felt.<br /><br />This book has reminded me just how precious life is. You hear it all the time, \\"you don't know what you have until you've lost it,\\" \\"here today, gone tomorrow,\\" or \\"I won't be around forever,\\" things loved ones have said but weren't taken to heart as we neglect and deny the thoughts of them -really and truly- leaving us. But no, we can't stay in that cozy dark cave forever. We have to wake up and realize the truth behind these statements, and cherish our moments together even more than before. I believe our memories can keep us going upon losing that special someone, as well as the support of family and friends. On a more personal note relating to this realization, I'm currently facing quite a few complications in my life. Almost hitting the big 2-5, I've began getting rather sick late last year, beginning with rather simple but annoying migraines day-by-day, and now escalating into abdominal pains, nausea, dizziness, sensitivity to light, so on and so forth. It's the nausea and abdominal pains that really keep me leveled, it keeps me from activities and I hate that. Before the end of last year, I was able to get up, get set, and get out the house with ease. But now, now I feel like hell some mornings that I just don't have the motivation to go somewhere I'm invited to. But...if characters such as Hazel and Augustus and Isaac can make this effort, if they can keep going, and they've certainly had it worse than me, then I sure as hell will try to, too. It's worth going to that rather boring seminar with a relative, worth heading to a friend's small business opening, worth it all. As unsociable as I am, I now more than ever want to make the effort to at least show up and be there for others, spend that precious little time that we have. I don't prefer to be close with many, I like my small circle just the way it is,but it's as psychoanalyst Harry Stack Sullivan said, \\"loneliness is the most painful human experience.\\" And damn it, it is.<br /><br />In any case, I thank you for reading my attempted recommendation of this book. Please, you owe it to yourself to give it a read.<br /><br />*Edit*<br />Looks like it's getting a movie!

B004EPYZV2|4.0|By the time the fourth Mission: Impossible film starts, it has become apparent that something is a little different this time around.  Maybe it's the fact that the last film was considered a disappointment (I actually thought it was the best of the series) and maybe it's the fact that franchise star Tom Cruise has relinquished the reins a bit here and there, but in the end, Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol is surprisingly great.  This time around Ethan Hunt (Cruise), along with his team (Jeremy Renner, Simon Pegg, and Paula Patton) find their backs against the wall big time as IMF is disavowed by the government and a new villain (Michael Nyqvist of the overseas The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo series) arises with intentions of global nuclear holocaust.  Relentless in terms of its action, Ghost Protocol is the live-action debut of Pixar's Brad Bird, and he brings the same brand of manic energy to the live action realm that he did in the world of animation.  All in all, Ghost Protocol isn't the best action flick you'll see, but in terms of mainstream action/adventure/espionage, you'll have a difficult time finding something better out there right now.

B002MQYOFW|1.0|This is the worst book I've read in a long time. A complete waste of time. I am still trying to figure out what the point was. No moral compass, no reason for the games to exist, the so-called love interest wasn't interesting. A good basic idea for a book squandered, instead it is really only a computer game on paper. Thank goodness it only took me 4 days to read. This book is aimed at teenagers but due to its graphic nature and complete disregard for humanity, only adults should read this book, but few would if they knew what was in store for them.

B0071XO8RA|3.0|I enjoyed reading the Wool Omnibus books.  The characters were interesting and it kept me guessing all the time, which I love!  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was the author's propensity for long drawn out descriptions of settings and/or characters' actions.  All I need to know, for instance, is that the character put her knife away, after some fumbling.  Don't need a detailed joint by joint movement of the knife into the sheath.  These common digressions into painful detail slowed the book noticeably.  After a while, I could sense one coming and would skim it.  The plot line and characters more than make up for this and keep Wool an all but engrossing read.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I LOVE these books!  I am not one that is into this type of sexual lifestyle, but I think the story behind it all is very intriguing.  I was hooked from the first chapter and all the way to the end of the trilogy.  I was so upset when it ended as I wanted it to continue on.  I am hoping she writes books from Christian's point of view.  It will not be a dissapointment to anyone who has an open mind and likes romance novels that are not your typical \\"Harlequin\\" books. HIGHLY RECOMMEND this book and the entire trilogy!
B0059XTUXQ|2.0|There are some historical films that work and others that don't. I'm not going to go into whether or not they're completely accurate to the facts and what really happened; I'm judging from an entertainment standpoint here. \\"J. Edgar\\" was interesting. \\"JFK\\" kept you on the edge of your seat mentally. \\"My Week With Marilyn\\" was a classy little film.<br /><br />Unfortunately, things didn't go so well for Margaret Thatcher in \\"The Iron Lady.\\" What could have been an intriguing jaunt through the life of Britain's first and only female prime minister somehow became a cluttered mess of selected snapshots randomly thrown together with no apparent rhyme or reason.<br /><br />The one thing that I can't pick apart is Meryl Streep's performance. She is excellent as the driven woman who stood against all opposition to rise above and do her duty.<br /><br />It's hard to gauge \\"The Iron Lady\\" (Blu-ray + DVD + Digital Copy). I found the movie itself to be a cinematic mess as far as pacing and structure. On the other hand, all of the actors performed marvelously and it looks beautiful. There are special features, but they're rather short for the most part. The movie received mixed reviews, so this truly is the sort of film that is based on personal tastes.

B00005JLIU|2.0|Thoroughly Moronic Millie<br /><br />Wow!  I think that when I'm on my deathbed, my greatest regret will be having forever lost the 2 1/2 hours of my life I squandered watching one of the lamest, botched attempts at musical comedy ever vomited onto the silver screen.  If you should hate your boss so much that you'd like to pull a John Wilkes Booth on him or her, then hand the reprobate a copy of this 1920s satire and glow about how great you thought it was.  He or she should have hung him- or herself in their garage by the end of the first act.<br /><br />Blake Edwards was a first-class director and always got the best performance from his actors, but he often had a knack for creating comedies that were so dry they made Death Valley look like the Pacific Ocean.  The original Arthur was one of his rare exceptions.<br /><br />There was terrible miscasting to contend with as well.  Although Julie Andrews gives a knockout performance and carries the movie, she is a bad choice and likely got the role for being Blake Edwards' wife.  No one has ever really justified how her aristocratic London accent makes sense here, given that her role is that of a flunky secretary who wants to find a rich boss to marry for financial security.  There's nothing in the plot that elucidates why she's the only British person in the movie.  How much sense would it make for William F. Buckley to play the role of Rocky Balboa instead of Sylvester Stallone?  Or maybe one of the Wayans brothers as Hamlet?  I rest my case.<br /><br />And pointing out that this is a tongue-in-cheek, campy little romp doesn't cut it:  characters still have to be appropriate to their roles for credibility's sake.  And though Mary Tyler Moore looks the part of a naive ingenue, she mostly comes off as a pasty-faced waif whose performance is more wooden than Roger Moore's during his turn as James Bond.  Only Carol Channing fits her role as the kooky swell with a heart of gold.<br /><br />How this movie got rated as a musical escapes me, given that it had very few songs, only a few of which were actually performed. Most were just background pieces.  This was a movie with music, period.  And for what it's worth, the music was about the only redeeming aspect of this celluloid dung heap.  Elmer Bernstein's score garnered an Oscar, and deservedly so:  it was a spot-on pastiche of 20s music that was relentlessly joyful and splashy.  Its inspired flair was instrumental in giving this movie a sense of pacing or momentum.  Also of great merit was the venerable Cahn and Van Heusen title song, Thoroughly Modern Millie, which well-deserved its Oscar nomination.  This legendary team, who were a favorite song source for Frank Sinatra, produced a masterful flapper-era story song that was a lyrical tour-de-force, and serves as a lesson for anyone interested in becoming a legitimate song writer.<br /><br />But if you want to see what a 20s musical comedy actually looks like, rent The Marx Brother's hilarious The Cocoanuts or Cole Porter's wacky Anything Goes or whimsical Les Girls.  The only thing funny about Thoroughly Modern Millie are the moments when Julie Andrews mugs for the camera, but in her case it was merely cute for mostly looking staged, whereas when Groucho Marx did it in his movies, it was actually funny, and largely because it looked genuinely spontaneous.<br /><br />What blows my mind is that this travesty was eventually adapted as a Broadway musical.  Really?  Its plot line is so gossamer-thin, that if it were a pizza crust it would have stretched out far enough to cover Texas.  \\"Millie\\" qualifies as a \\"popcorn\\" musical at best.  But for contemporary musical stage fare with a 20s motif, you're much better off buying a ticket to The Drowsy Chaperone, which is just as lightweight, but exponentially more fun.<br /><br />I'd like to rant on further about how thoroughly ripped off I felt by the end of Thoroughly Modern Millie, but I've just hung myself in my garage and I can't reach mycomputer keyboard from up here.
B0057R5XRG|4.0|Came as advertised -- Blu Ray with digital copy.  I had to knock it a star for the awful 2nd and 3rd movies in the trilogy, and how you can't buy the first movie without the other two because of this pack.
B007SYWFRM|1.0|I looked at all the other reviews and they said it wont let me get out I thought they were lying so I got it and I had 2 shut my kindle off 2 get out of it do not waste ur time

B007V2UGPE|5.0|great graphics and awesome gameplay for a free game. Also all of the upgrades and such un thebstore are a good addition instead of just fighting zombies without any upgrades like that
B007JRU2UK|2.0|I was disappointed in this movie.  I expected more because of the rave reviews it received.  Just a mediocre plot with a disfunctional family.  I wouldn't recommend it.
B0025KVLTW|5.0|What more can I say - these are the Beatles - the best - they are brilliant.. they changed the world and changed music forever

B007N5YIUS|5.0|Love it love it. I love the new anti gravity and the orbits. Wish it had incentives like the eagles or dragon. It would had been cool if it added like aliens or something.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|I was really enjoying this game until it started to give quests that involve harassing your facebook friends to play.  I will not bother my fb friends with invites therefore I will not be able to complete probably several quests.  VERY frustrating.  I was in the verge of buying some of the in came currency...good thing I didn't Cu's ultimately this game will sadly be deleted.<br /><br />however if you don't mind bothering your fb friends...it's an extremely fun game.
B00715SUI6|4.0|First off, I should say that I LOVED parts one and two. The first two relied more heavily on very slow-building tension. These predecessors basically \\"taught\\" viewers how to watch these movies in the first 20-30 minutes by offering numerous subtle, relatively unimportant objects moving as if a spectral breeze had shifted them. This way when such production devices became important, the viewer had a trained eye--not unlike what was done with White Noise. These movies convey a style that is very unusual. So it came as no surprise to me that there was little middle ground in people's opinions of them; they loved'em or hated'em. I love'em. Why? Because my senses are all on full power; I'm all in; I'm practically concentrating on the screen and listening to every creak trying to sleuth out the next clue that something fishy is going on in that house. Some people may call this \\"work\\". I call it cool. [But people chatting during the movie are a much greater distraction than normal under the circumstances.]<br /><br />This third installment was my least favorite, but I can totally understand why it may be others' favorite. While it still employed subtle moving objects, it did it less, instead relying on more mainstream devices to provoke scared jumps from the audience. It also borrowed more heavily from the Poltergeist movies than the first two--not that I minded. The characters' investigation into the strange goings-on was more methodical and plot-driven. The first two were more event-driven and investigated more out of fear and curiosity. The differences between 3 and 1 & 2 were subtle, but numerous, chief amongst them being that \\"the paranormal\\" functions as a character in this movie, rather than a mysterious \\"force\\" in the first two. As such, the actions of \\"the paranormal\\" were more blatant and felt more like \\"it\\" was doing something \\"to someone\\" whereas in 1 & 2 it was more like \\"something was happening\\" to someone in a haunted house.<br /><br />The plot is simple. A family lives in a house. Weird things start happening. Step-dad starts putting cameras around the house. Things get weirder. And from there anything more would give too much away. But while the first two movies' endings left us largely to wild speculation, I will say that this one ends with something of an explanation of the paranormal activity.<br /><br />It doesn't really matter in which order you watch these movies. However, each sequel (or in this case prequel) was designed to mold over the events of the previous installment. So watch them in order if it's convenient. I also demand you watch these with the lights off. It makes it easier to avoid distractions while you're concentrating on the screen.family lives in a house. Weird things start happening.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was an excellent book.  I didn't think it would be such a page turner, but I was wrong. Couldn't stop reading and wanting to see what would happen.
B0068ZZ6CI|5.0|Awesome sounds and great remixes! The album has the best songs that sound amazing. Rammstein is one of the greatest rock bands ever!
B007WPM4V4|4.0|I did not like Episode 6 as much as some of the other ones. It seemed dull and not too interesting. That said, I will still continue to watch this as I have watched all the seasons and I really like the show and the actors/actresses.
B0011Z5IVE|5.0|I think it is so funny that one person would take so much time to wright all the 1 star reviews.  Is is so obvious they are all written by the same person.  Led Zeppelin is far above any band.  There will never be another band like them or as good.
B00005RFAI|5.0|Love pink and this is another one to add to my pink collection, amazon makes it so ez to shop for stuff you like and quickly, built up my pink collection in one shopping trip, for around twenty bucks very pleased with purchase and amazon.

006197806X|5.0|Lauren Oliver is officially one of my favorite authors. All of the books I've read by her -- Before I Fall, Delirium, and now Pandemonium -- have absolutely blown me away. All of her books are beautiful and jam packed with emotion. She has this amazing way of writing, where the words flow seamlessly, and the descriptions are so perfect that the entire book comes to life while you read it. She effortlessly weaves backstory through the novel, breathing life into each character she writes.<br /><br />Anyway, enough about me talking about Lauren Oliver's amazing writing skills, and onto my review of Pandemonium!<br /><br />The end of Delirium left me in tears. I closed the book and was sad for a fews days, because I COULDN'T BELIEVE it ended the way it did. I thought it was a standalone, because I couldn't imagine how the series could be continued after the dramatic ending in Delirium. But I was so happy when I heard Pandemonium was coming out! There was also a part of me that was worried as well, because with the way Delirium ended, I knew the characters I'd come to know and love in Delirium would most likely not be in Pandemonium. And I was right -- the only character in Pandemonium from Delirium was Lena, although Lena did think about her friends and family from Portland throughout the book. BUT Lauren Oliver made it work!<br /><br />I literally couldn't put Pandemonium down when I was reading. Now that she's out in the Wilds, Lena has changed so much from the girl we first met in Delirium. She's tough and strong, and learns that life in the Wilds isn't as perfect as she imagined. We meet lots of new characters, and learn that the Resistance isn't what Lena originally thought it would be. We experience Lena's grief, and we journey with her as she goes on a mission of her own. We also get to see Lena fall in love again, this time with someone totally unexpected.<br /><br />Then there was the ending. Lauren Oliver shocked me with the ending of Delirium, and did it again with the ending of Pandemonium. All I can say is -- I wasn't expecting that, OMG, and I need book three NOW!<br /><br />If you haven't read anything by Lauren Oliver yet, do yourself a favor and pick up one of her books! You'll be happy you did. She's easily one of the best writers to hit the current YA scene. Every book she writes entrances me and leaves me wanting more. I can't wait to see how she ends the incredible Delirium Trilogy!n with the ending of Pandemonium. All I can say is -- I wasn't expecting that, OMG, and I need book three NOW!<br /><br />If you haven't read anything by Lauren Oliver yet, do yourself a favor and pick up one of her books!

B004VMVTNU|5.0|I use this app every day. I love the many aspects of customization, from what alarm noise to use to the difficulty level of math problems. It allows you to make it perfect for YOU. I wouldn't change a thing about it.
0345803485|5.0|If I had to describe this book in one word, it would be INTENSE! From Ana and Christian's relationship to Christian's internal struggles to Ana's emotional roller-coaster, the entire 380 pages are intense. The story is told in first-person present tense, which I have to admit thew me at first, but I quickly became engrossed in Ana's thoughts and intrigued with her perception of Christian and her take on their affair. Christian is a multi-faceted hero. Yes, he's drop-dead gorgeous, but he's also troubled, overbearing and possessive. As odd as it sounds, it's his flaws that really make him alluring -- it's no wonder Ana is willing to submit to him!
B0045NXMJE|5.0|If you enjoyed the comic whimsy of Amelie, you'll enjoy Micmacs. Jean-Pierre Jeunet's touch is evident in this light-hearted yet moving romp. We are made aware of the random moments that shape our lives and the ways in which people need and support each other as we follow Bazil from childhood trauma to accidental injury to his ultimate victory over the uncaring weapons manufacturers who were responsible for his pain. The little guys meet the big guys head-on and win with unexpected, hilarious and clever antics. I laughed and cheered for the underdog and thoroughly enjoyed myself.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This is the one of the best apps I 've downloaded in quite a while, definitely worth the time!! It's great game to unwind with!!!
B006PHD0RW|5.0|So much fun.  Bright graphics, smooth controls. If you enjoy puzzle games like Cut The Rope or Where's My Water, you'll enjoy this one. No problems on either my EVO phone or Transformer tablet.
B005R4255C|5.0|Getting this cd itself was an ordeal but that is not what this review is about. The cd is amazing. I love mashups of songs. Other reviewers have said that the bells, drums, hand claps and stuff take away from Micheal's music. For me it just made me want to see the show more to see how it all fit together. Now after seeing the show when I heard the stuff on the cd I can see it in my mind. Only complaint is that Dirty Diana, She's Out of My Life, Blood on the Dance Floor, Behind the Mask, and Torture were not used. I will be very surprised if this show does not come out on dvd.
B000Q7ZND6|5.0|Great film for both comics and films fans. Marvellous Blu-Ray edition! I strongly suggest for friday night session [and a cigar, in case you smoke!]
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I'm not a big reader and this book kept my attention the ENTIRE time. I couldn't get enough. Great read. I highly suggest Catching Fire and Mockingjay also.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I really love this game! I'm a total addict. Solitaire is my second favorite. I'm finally getting into card games.
B0067RQYNW|1.0|Apparently if you don't upgrade immediately, you can't even use this product.  I'll stick with Apple's \\"Lite\\" versions, they can actually be launched and used.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|why am I addicted to this game no clue... super pointless requires you to wait aimlessly for hours to collect coins and there's only one interactive game which is repetive and even if you do bad you get the same amout of points. lame
0545091020|5.0|Great book series.  I'm half way through the second book.  Hunger Games book is much better than the movie. As always, easy order & Great delivery.
B0063IH60K|5.0|It's solitaire, so there isn't much to mess up. Always a fan of the game and this version is great. And you can't beat the price...free! Highly recommend.
030746363X|5.0|I have been enjoying my \\"lifestyle change\\" for 7 weeks now and have lost 12 lbs. I went from working out 5 days a week prior to starting to 2-3 days a week now. I only continue the workouts to feel stronger. I feel better without the carbs and find it much easier to stick to the diet knowing that you can eat the things you want one day a week. When I really crave something I just file it away for the cheat day. I am calling it a lifestyle change because it is 100% do-able long term. I begin every morning with a protein shake as i am not a big breakfast person and eat meat, chicken or pork and veggies every day. I have cut out the beans as I really got sick of eating them and have continued to see weight loss. I think the biggest thing about the beans is that they do keep you full and promote good digestion, I just got sick of them. since starting this diet i have started o drink wine and find  it is very easy to do when you go out with others. I have yet to find myself at a restaurant that I could not create a meal.  I am about 5-7lbs from my goal but have lost a pile of inches. I didn't realize I had that much to lose but lost 2sizes and look and feel great. The first 10 lbs came off the first 2 weeks and I continue to get smaller. One thing...you can not cheat (other than your one day a week) and expect it to work. The results help the willpower! I strongly believe it is easier to do because when you really crave something you CAN have it....you just might have to wait a couple days.
B002JVWRAO|5.0|The product arrived safely. It came with its original plastic; it even had a sticker from the 'CW' on it to further prove its authenticity. I was very happy when it arrived.
B007QNRMUU|5.0|How do you top being a fantastic singer/songwriter who comes out with something different, new and amazing? By doing it again and again. No two Mraz albums are quite alike except having lyrics that bring out the best of life and music that makes you feel the songs. This album delivers that yet again. Another success in my eyes. I love \\"love\\"
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Love this game, and my daughter loves to play it. It's a fun knock-off of Mario Bros. Highly recommend it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|There have been thousands of reviews of the Hunger Games and the Trilogy. I loved all three and I like the fact that each book has subtle reminders of the previous information given in the previous book. I do not think that the books could each stand alone, but it is nice that the books are fast paced and the character development is excellent.  I felt like I knew and understood each character and his or her persona prevailed nicely. There was a little back story as well to fill the characters in and make them more familiar.<br /><br />The books are excellent, fast paced as well as thrilling!<br /><br />The books have some violence, and elude to such things, but not over the top and not offensive at all. There is more violence in after school cartoons than what is found in these books.<br /><br />Some people gave long, dissertation like reviews on the books, and give away a lot of the story.... I think that it is not necessary, the books are just books, meant for entertainment value, nothing more or less. I think they are great!<br /><br /> I do think that they are amazing and give KUDOS to Ms Collins, she deserves to be on cloud nine with the success of these books and now the movie! Congrats!
B003L77GGK|2.0|Even though it came in plastic, when I opened it, the box had faded coloring and bubbles on it. The plastic box it came in also seems fake. It looks close to the orginals, but definately not the same material. The picture that was in the DVD casing was obviously not well handed. The small booklet that was inside that provided as the episode guide was not in good condition. The DVD's all look real and I played the first episode. The quality seems amazing, but the menu is not the same as the other five seasons. I don't mean to nit pick.<br />If this is the real thing, then I just must've gotten a very bad product(though I doubt it to be authentic, though it's very close). Even if it is the real thing, I apologize for thinking it's fake, but if it's real and looks this bad.... Something went wrong there.<br />I won't be giving it back, but I also won't be keeping it for myself. I'll buy another one, one I know to be real (from a store). I'll give this as a gift to my neice, who just recently started to watch the show. :)
B005LAIGW8|5.0|Ghost Rider returns and is badder than ever. this sequel to the first movie was awesome. i love the ghost rider character. and ghost rider is more darker in this one. i loved that nicolas cage returned as ghost rider/johnny blaze. i wish that they brought back peter fonda as mephisto. but the new guy was pretty good. i thought that the actor who played carrigan/blackout as he is known in the comics. was good. i did love the twinkie joke that was funny. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do.

0439023513|5.0|Mockingjay by Suzanne Collins is the last book of the Hunger Games trilogy.  Each book manages to stand on its own, but the truth is they are just sections of one book that is so hard to put down that the publishers did the readers a favor by breaking it up. All of it is extremely well written, with tight suspense, touching love scenes and the grinding, merciless affects of war on every aspect of all the character's lives.<br />Katniss and Peeta are both severely damaged, but manage to carry on.  Gale does his best for the rebellion, but in the end learns the cost of being ruthless.<br />Perhaps one of the best things about this story is the ACCOUNTING.  Each decision the characters make has an upside and a downside and what they win is always shown very clearly against what they have lost.<br />This story touches the heart of wars and the powerful people who gain advantages from having others fight them.  Moving the pieces around on their game boards in their safe war rooms, they never have to think of the real people who are left with the choices to fight or die because they have been unfortunate enough to have some use to the game makers.<br />The story is very hard to put down; it is a fast satisfying read.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I must say,this book is one I could not put down. I am hooked,Mr.Gray is someone I would have loved to come across in my youth.With out revealing too much.It left me wanting more for myself..
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it's fun trying to unlock the games. I'm not very far into the game. I like it a lot. they did a good job
B0052VUNHC|5.0|Ok, i was a little wary when i bought this, but once i started reading the first page, i was hooked! The book made me laugh, cry, and angry! That is what i want when i read a book, i want to feel the emotion that the characters have, and i did. I even lost sleep over this book. I went to bed and woke up in the middle of the night thinking abou this book, i couldnt get back to sleep so i started readning again.<br />I love Abby and Travis' relationship. It lets you know that love conquers all! Although i could have done without the waiting a few months after thanksgiving to finally tell travis, i still loved it. I usually find books that i read once and never pick up again, but this is nothing like those. Definently reading again!!!!
1451627289|4.0|I was surprised when I learned that horror writer Stephen King had released a book about President Kennedy.  I have only read or listened to two books from King, and this one is definitely the better of the two.  I really enjoyed the setting of the late 1950s to early 1960s.  I also liked the love story between George Amberson and librarian Sadie Dunhill.  The way that relationship is shown at the end of the book brought tears to my eyes.  It would definitely be interesting to be able to visit the past, especially if there was an ability to reset everything back to normal if necessary.  King seems very suspicious of the time travel and imagines a lot of terrible results.  It's fun to imagine how the country could be different if Kennedy had lived and served a second term.  I wonder if we would have less debt and a smaller federal government.
0345803485|5.0|i really liked this book - i do audiobooks cause i have no time to read and this book shouldn't be played without headphones. i really did like it though
B00028U6B8|5.0|While I have the original album, purchased some 40 some odd years ago, the recording was never good with numerous clicks and crackles.  This is a LOT clearer and the sound is rich, voices beautiful.  You won't be disappointed.  This is a great companion to At The Family Dog Ballroom, live Airplane.
0307346617|5.0|This book was a lovely departure from the traditional zombie horror story. While it would even be fair to say the zombies were a background detail that could have easily been swapped with a number of other natural (or unnatural) disasters, I'm rather glad the story chose the zombies. The disjointed narrative has the interesting effect of distancing the reader from the horror unfolding on the pages, and allowing a very objective view of events that's pretty unusual for the zombie genre. There is a little bit of a slant in how the author treats some of the first world countries' reactions, but overall it's a imaginative and perhaps plausible view of how the world might unravel in the face of a terrible and overwhelming crisis.<br />Also, I don't think it was intentional, but this book reminded me a lot of another book; An Oral History of World War II.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This series was absolutely wonderful. Once you start reading it becomes near impossible to put down. The end of each chapter leaves you on the edge of your seat and needing to find out what happens next. I found myself putting off chores, staying awake late into the night, and taking any opportunity to read. Action, adventure, romance, politics, if any or all of these intrest you, then you will not be disipointed. Best money I have spent in a long time. Buy and enjoy.
0345803493|5.0|i like how this book carried on and the direction its taking. i really do enjoy it and can't wait to finish the third
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Fifty shades of grey is now on my favourite list for books. I love this story, it was funny, sad, very deep and touching, as well as very hot! I loved the character's throughout the story. E L James certainly has a talent for creating such complex and likable characters. Christian and Ana make a wonderful couple. Christian is so complex, clever, confident, strong, dominant, highly successful on one side, and uncertain, lost, sad, emotionally scarred on the other. Ana is clever, witty, shy, vulnerable, beautiful inside and out, and amazingly strong and brave. Her tenacious spirit throughout the book helps tear down the many barriers that Christian (fifty shades) has armoured himself in. The book was well paced and kept me up to the wee hours reading as I couldn't put it down. Even though the book revolves around BDSM and Christian's kinky hangups, I still found the story very sweet and yeah very sexy.<br />The other character's in the story were entertaining and it was enjoyable to see their lives unfold around the two main character's. I liked this book so much I downloaded the other two books (fifty shades darker and fifty shades freed) straight away. I have finished all three books now and I am beginning to read them again because they were so much fun and very poignant. I was recommended these books by a friend and I am really glad, I would recommend these books to anyone who likes a good romance story and hot steamy sex scenes.
B0072PUC7W|5.0|Once again Armin Van Buuren has produced yet another album of cutting edge dance tracks. Going back to a slightly heavier beat and sound AVB releases another successful State of Trance album. If you have been a collector of the series, this is a must have! Enjoy!
B001CDZZI6|5.0|This book open my mind, and help me understand a lot of the way I do things.<br />I strongly reccomend to read the book and do the test.
B005C9YZIW|5.0|The 2011 six-Bluray special edition is also the definitive version as it contains all the extras that were cut from original Blu-ray release as well the original narration by David Attenborough. The Packaging comes in a great hardcover book style case with each page housing a Blu-ray and takes as much space as a single DVD case.<br /><br />Out of all the Planet Earth releases, this is the best and most complete version by far.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Book was readable on ipad and phone everythis was so fast and easy and not to expensive at all for a best selling book.  A great way to get the book fast instead of having to wait for it to ship..
0345803507|5.0|Yes...there is a lot of sex.  Kinky sex, hot sex, with very good reason.  A lot of books have characters that have sex.  This is a character driven book...and as you go along for the ride, leave your expectations at the door.  This is a truly gut-wrenching love story. I rooted for these two people to make it.  E L James wrote from a real, raw sense of what a lot of women and men are looking for.  That does not mean we want to live it...it is vicarious freedom.  Anastasia and Christian...even the names are perfect.  There is also a very important plot here. A story about how a person can come from the very worst and end up with the very best.  It was incredible to read through to the last page and really want more.  I am not so sure how this will make out as a movie!  The characters are so perfectly written that it will be hard to cast them.  I have to say that if you are looking for something that you will never forget, and probably want to read through again...this is it.  Sex, love, sex, sadness, happiness, even fear.

B006OFN0SE|2.0|A film about a controversial and prominent figure in American history should have been more compelling than this one directed by Clint Eastwood.  Leonardo Di Caprio seems to have become less convincing an actor as he has aged.  I thought he was really fine in \\"This Boy's Life\\" and quite good in \\"The Departed\\" and \\"Gangs of New York\\"-- less so in \\"Shutter Island\\" and \\"Inception,\\" the latter not making a whole lot of sense to me and I like science fiction.  In \\"The Aviator\\" and \\"J. Edgar\\" he seems to be portraying the same  type of  character with a sort of one-note performance particularly in the latter.<br /><br />I found the supporting cast to be very engaging -- Naomi Watts as Helen Gandy, his secretary and perhaps Edgar's \\"second wife\\" and Armie Hammer as Clyde Tolson, his lifelong friend and companion.  As always Judi Dench was excellent in a relatively brief performance as Hoover's mother.  This picture did not draw me in as did Oliver Stone's \\"Nixon,\\" a very intense and rather creepy film having stunning editing.  The makeup used for the aged Hoover and  particularly Tolson made them look like corpses.<br /><br />There aren't, I suppose, many films or recordings documenting Hoover's visage and voice -- I'm not really certain what he looked like.  But that's not the point:  Anthony Hopkins did not look very much, if at all, like Richard Nixon but he somehow managed to generate the character of Nixon from the inside out and he had your interest from his first moment on the screen.  I was never similarly affected by Mr. Di Caprio's portrayal of J. Edgar Hoover.
1593080409|5.0|This version (the Barnes & Noble Classics Series) is an affordable and complete (in two volumes) collection of Doyle's most popular series of work: Sherlock Holmes's mysteries. Holmes's popularity has survived more than a century and shows no signs of fading, as he is a key character--both recognized and enjoyed--in modern culture as he ever was. Although there are many versions of these stories available, the B&N Classic Series is a recommended consideration for buyers, especially those who don't have their heart set on a hard cover edition. Happy reading...
1594203334|5.0|I really don't get what all of the fuss is about. I suppose the marketing for the book and the articles that get written about it all focus on some supposed Franco-American mommy war. Maybe that sells books and reviews. But in reading it, I don't see that at all. It's simply a humorous, thought-provoking, self-deprecating memoir by an American mom living overseas.<br /><br />Sure, the French can be ridiculous with some of the parenting stuff, and to be perfectly fair, we can be absurd, too. Yet, there's stuff in here that's really made me pause (pun intended, if you've read the book) as I parent my son.  E.g., reality check that I can let him play on the playground without making suggestions for what he might do. I'm no helicopter mom, but reading a scene in the book made me realize that I'm more \\"helpful\\" than he needs.  (I should add, though, that self-reflection about my parenting is not the author's objective. At least, it doesn't come across that way at all. But as with any good book, it causes you to think...)<br /><br />And further, the observations of a mom of three, based entirely on her own personal experiences, can be amusing. Laugh-out-loud funny at times.  (e.g., a comment about French moms and epidurals) Having the extra info about sociological/psychological/anecdotal studies mixed in makes for educational reading, as well: it's just a nice, light read with some substance thrown in. This is a book that I've been taking to lunch on the rare days when I can sneak out of the office without work in tow. Given the writing style and the stories shared, I kinda wish that I had the author with me as a lunch date.

0679746323|1.0|This book is so biased against Mao and Communism it became amusing after a while.<br />The author appears to harbor a deep resentment against communist China since her father was once a member<br />of the Chinese Communist Party but was kicked out, forcing her to start work sooner than she would have liked.<br />She is constantly drifting off into tirades about Mao's personal life and she was another of his scorned lovers.<br />I soon learned to doubt any of her 'facts'.<br />Sure, Mao was not a perfect man but you could write a similar book about any military leader in history if all<br />you wanted to do was defame that particular leader. All you need to do is point out the tragedies that happened<br />during the wars he was involved in and speculate on his motives and his personal involvement in each incident.<br />The truth is, Mao saved China for the Chinese and didn't let it slip into the hands of the aggressors.<br />Not a bad record for a military man if you ask me.<br />As far as communism goes, that is up to personal opinion of each reader.<br />Its painfully obvious the author is out to discredit communism at each and every turn by whatever means available,<br />truth be damned.<br />An amusing bit of selective history propaganda.

0307594009|4.0|Anne Frank was a powerful book that moved me. In it, a young teenage girl named Anne Frank was forced into hiding by the Nazi power in Germany. The book is a memoir of her life and struggles. It previews the dramatic sacrifices that the Jewish people were forced to succumb to during this time period. After several months of discrimination, a family friend named Meip offered them a space above Otto Frank's office where they could live until the war was over. They went with the Van Dussels and lived in the small annex for a few years. As time passed the families began to disagree and resentment spread throughout the small space. Anne began to mature and grow as a yuoung woman. She started to have feelings for Peter, a boy approximately her age who lived with them. This book encompasses her struggles with becoming a woman and living in continual fear of being discovered by the Nazis.<br /> Patience and respect for other people were the two most common themes in the book. The families had to have patience with one another in order to successfully survive together. Another theme was respect because the German people didn't respect the Jewish culture or beliefs and as a result, the holocaust was permitted to take place.<br /> I liked this book because it made me appreciate what I have and not take anything for granted. I have a very good life and in the course of reading this book I have come to be more grateful for it. I didn't like this book there were parts when Anne got on my nerves. She was whiny and ungrateful for the protection that she was lucky enough to have.<br /> I would recommend this book because it's very important to learn about history. The holocaust was a terrible time in history and we have to remember it so that nothing like it could ever happen again.<br /> Another good book that takes place in this time period would be Night by Elie Wiesel. It is the story of a young man who went to Auschwitz and watched his entire family die.<br /> Overall, I would rate this book as a four out of five. It was captivating and enjoyable.rate this book as a four out of five. It was captivating and enjoyable.

1416511946|5.0|A lot of people are repulsed by this book because they feel it is just all about how messed up Nikki's life is, how much drugs he does, how many girls he debases, etc. Well, to that, I have to say: what did you expect? It's called The Heroin Diaries, and even a cursory glance at the cover and a flip through to look at the artwork within will tell you it's not going to be about sunshine and roses.<br /><br />I'm a recovering addict myself (though not from heroin). Still...I found this book very relevant. I never had the rock star millions to spend on drugs, but I feel the way the drug high and lows are portrayed are very accurate and universal to anyone who has been through it. And to those who haven't...it's a harrowing look at how a drug addict's life really is.<br /><br />I was irritated by Vanity's (ahem, I mean, Denise Williams's) little side notes in here - so over-the-top with the religious craziness - but I guess that was the point. All in all, I found it to be an interesting read and further look into the life of one of my favorite musicians. For the record, just because I love Nikki Sixx's work doesn't mean I'm blindly giving him praise. I honestly think his other book, TIGH, was far inferior to this one. But I've read this one a few times now, and I find the story it tells just as captivating each and every time.
B001HC8516|4.0|This book is very witty, humorous, and straight to the point!  However, I think the best thing about it is that it is a very accurate reflection of reality.  In each chapter they address a \\"type\\" of guy and address the shortcomings of dating such a person.  I gave it four stars not because the book itself had any issues but because if you buy the kindle version, you can't use the workbook section unless you print it out ahead of time, which just seems like kind of a hassle.

031603441X|1.0|I love reading autobiographies...and even though I'm not a massive Stones fan, I figured Keith Richard would have some fascinating stories to tell.<br /><br />Not so, apparently. There was way, way too much time devoted to boring stories about his childhood. I realize that every good autobiography will naturally mention childhood. But this was so long and drawn out, and not because it was anything fascinating. It was like someone just rambling on and on about absolutely nothing of substance, and you just want to say, \\"Shut up and get on with it already!\\"<br /><br />There was plenty in here about drug use - I mean, yes, it IS Keith Richards we're talking about, of course there will be a lot of talk about drug use - but surprisingly, not as much as I expected as far as touring, nothing in-depth at all, really, about the Stones. It was all the same old same old - nothing new or insightful, nothing I haven't already seen in various interviews. The whole point of an autobiography, in my opinion, is to give the readers a glimpse of something new or something they didn't already know. This is just...blah. I honestly can't think of any other word to describe it.<br /><br />I really had to slog through this long, long book. it would have been great if this book was this long, yet full of interesting and new stories, but it's not. At least I didn't spend money on it - thank you, local library, for sparing me that!

1843547201|4.0|Aravind Adiga,  The WhiteTiger<br /><br />This Booker-winning novel exposing the corruptions rife in contemporary India comes with many plaudits from America, Britain, India, Germany, but not as far as I can see from China or Russia, which is significant in that the ills besetting the last two countries are not dissimilar to those of India, except that poverty is as far as one knows less extensive.  Adiga's novel begins with an address to `The Premier's Office in Beijing, Capital of the Freedom-Loving Nation of China' given by the son of a rickshaw-puller, Balram Halwai. Balram, our narrator, is a wanted man, having, as he soon tells us, cut the throat of his employer, Mr Ashok.  Balram was his driver and had become that very rare thing, a trusted servant, in his employer's eyes.  Gradually we learn of the seedy world behind the fine promises of democracy; we learn of the way that the ever more expanding and ever more desperate poor are treated by the rich and powerful, of the hypocrisy and indifference of the rich few to the plight of the teeming millions whom they exploit.  And in this book it is funny - for we readers, that is.<br /><br />Does Balram exaggerate?  Possibly, but the reader is entertained by the antics of this `entrepreneur' who is forced to become, and happy to call himself, `a mass murderer.' True he has only killed one man, but his example will likely be followed by other slaves who are obliged to kill in order to survive. Addressing  His Excellency  Wen Jiaho in the Premier's Office in China, Bulram boasts `my start-up has got this contract with American Express, my start-up runs the software in this hospital in London,' but this is not his story, which is about Indian politics, which boasts of democracy, but beats up dissenters.  The way up, as pigherd Vijay discovered was to `let the politician dip his beak into his backside,' to grease and brown-nose your way to the top of your profession as an entrepreneur.  It's an unsavoury business, but it gets results and keeps you from dying of hunger. It's so sad that laughter is the only possible response.  This is not exactly documentary, but closer to it than the satire of Swift and Orwell.t gets results and keeps you from dying of hunger. It's so sad that laughter is the only possible response.

0938045768|5.0|This is by far the best body weight conditioning book I've ever read.  The \\"convict\\" part of it is a lot of hype, but the actual program is extremely solid.

0739341243|4.0|Quiet: The Power of Introverts is a great book. As I learned new things about what it means to be an introvert vs. an extrovert, I found myself telling my wife about it.  I have always thought that I am an introvert and after reading this book, I find that it is true.  At times, however I can be extroverted and this was causing me to wonder what side of the spectrum I fall on.  After reading this book it gives terminology to what is happening to me when I become extroverted.<br /><br />Overall this book is really interesting and a good read.  It was longer than I expected and one of the longer books I have read this year.  There were times when I found my mind wandering and this caused me to have to go back and read the same sentence/ paragraph/ page /chapter again.<br /><br />\\"The book covers the introvert psyche from birth, through personal relationships and how past and current organizational structures inhibit more than a third of the world's population, who may be classified as introverted. \\"Our schools, workplaces, and religious institutions are designed for extroverts.\\"<br /><br />So, it turns out that it's OK to be an introvert (and an extrovert). More importantly, that people should understand that it's alright to seek solitude and time alone. You don't always have to make the most noise or to try to fit in all the time.\\"<br /><br />This book is worth the read if you have time.  It will help you deal with people from all walks of life (along the personality scale) in your community groups, at work and with your friends.<br /><br />I received this book for free from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group for this review through their Blogging for Books program. I was not required to give a positive review on my blog battlebornnv.blogspot.com

0316056863|4.0|I had the pleasure of listening to this book on a road trip.  I love love love listening to audio books especially when they are read by their own author and especially when the author is funny, interesting and Tina Fey.  I have to admit that once I listen to this book I wanted to get online and post I love Tina Fey stuff all over but I honestly don't know where I would go to do this. So this is a small attempt to do that.<br /><br />The reason I liked this book so much was because I feel that I it helped me to gain insight on a topic that I always really enjoyed, but have never really known why. That topic is of course women in comedy, and one of the many the reasons I like Tina Fey and her women cohorts so much has been revealed through this book.  Women can be funny, feminine topics can be really really funny, this book taught me about how this was not a generally accepted idea and how women in comedy actually had to  work hard for this to become a commonly know fact.<br /><br />I really enjoyed listening to this book. Tina makes it so much funnier than I could ever have made it in my head reading it to myself.  I would basically describe it as advice.  Tina essentially leads you through her life, from childhood comedy to funny trials & tribulations in college, to working in the theatrical comedy improve world. I found the book entertaining and empowering, excellent read (or listen) and it wasn't just me, my husband was laughing out loud as well.

B003EYVXVE|5.0|I enjoyed this movie. Yes, I've read the books. People will always be upset because things are always missing from the story when you take a book and transfer it to film. I thought it was done well. Other people didn't understand the concept. This is a trilogy, you're not supposed to learn everything in the first book. Everything will come together, and there will be more understanding. Overall, it was a great representation of the book, in my opinion.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|This was the first reading material I got for my new Fire. I'd heard so much about the three books that I wanted to see what all the talk was about.  I knew they were written for teenagers as the target audience, and as someone a few years older I wasn't sure if they'd be too age-specific to be enjoyable.  Actually, I did enjoy them.  I have a very clear picture in my mind of what the main characters are like, and I almost feel I've been in the places where Katniss, Peeta, Haymitch, Gale and a large group of subsidiary characters play out this very interesting story.  Probably the most-riveting parts of the books have to do with the actual games in which Katniss and Peeta are force to compete, and my least favorite part was the infiltration of Panem by Katniss and crew - there was a lot of violence and everybody did their usual thing but somehow it wasn't as interesting.  Still, I would wholeheartedly recommend this as an interesting read for adults who like futurist action stories.

B0073U2FB2|4.0|This movie isnt all that bad, the action is good, the alien designs are different from recent alien invasion movies like Battle:Los Angeles, Skyline, & Cloverfield, as they seem to create some form of energy field that they use for invisible camouflage and is also their main weapon. The main cast in the film are regular civilian characters that in the beginning are far from being hero-types and react like everyone else in their situation with initial shock and fear not knowing who or what is attacking them and why. But as the story progresses they begin to learn about their new enemy and start adapting to survive being less and less victims and turning into fighters from the experience of now having to face the horrors of war. The character development was great for me at least for this particular reason. The special effects aren't amazing but it wasn't a big deal for me, I really enjoyed this flick and feel that it deserves a little better reception from critics because I really dont feel like this is a flawed film and Id think it be great if they made a sequel. So if your a sci-fi or alien invasion film fan I would suggest giving it a shot and rent it (at least to try and satisfy your appetite until The Avengers hits theaters next week), for anyone else I would recommend this too, but If your not into these kinds of movies then you should probably pass but I leave it up to you. FINAL SCORE: 4/5

0545403359|3.0|If you read and loved the novel Black Beauty, be warned that War Horse might seem like a cheap knock-off.  Told from the POV of the horse, War Horse recounts the story of one English horse who, through a series of mishaps, ends up on the battlefield of World War I.  By itself, it is a very nice story, especially for youngsters.  While it doesn't invoke the sheer emotional response that makes Black Beauty such a classic novel, it is decently told and - if I might add - far better than the movie version.  I would certainly recommend this for horse-lovers everywhere, with the caveat above.  Overall, a fine story, but not a classic.

0345803485|1.0|I'm afraid I find myself in the distinct minority here.  I truly did not care for this book.  But before I come under attack by all the fans of this now-popular novel, allow me to explain why.  It certainly was not due to the sexual content...sex was, after all, a primary component of this novel and it was both appropriate and necessary to the story.  I found myself immediately unsympathetic with the main character in the novel.  Without giving too much away, I can suffice to say that I simply could not believe that an intelligent young woman like Ana would actually make the relationship choice she did.  It made no sense and felt very contrived.  Similarly, while sex certainly has a place in many novels, here it seemed gratuitous - there just for the sake of shocking the reader instead of developing something of a storyline.  We are asked to believe that this young, smart, recent-college graduate, innocent of any prior relationships, would divert from her previous behavior patterns simply because she felt a man was physically attractive.  There was no development of any other emotion beyond wanting to get into each others pants.  This was reiterated over and over and over, ad nauseam, as was (if I may be allowed a petty moment here) the word \\"gasp.\\"  That word happened to appear at least once per page (sometimes more).  When I think of a person \\"gasping\\" I think of an audible intake of air.  If the characters in this book physically gasped this many times, the whole world would think them slightly off their rocker.  Okay, enough about my issue with one tiny word.<br /><br />As to the plot.  I felt it was highly, highly predictable.  We all knew, didn't we, what Ana's decision would be?  You could easily read to page 50, then skip to the last few pages and not have missed a darn thing, other than Ana's sexual escapades.<br /><br />As I've said, sex can play a great role in a novel.  But it won't fix what was, in my opinion, a weak novel.  I've come to understand, through various conversations with others who have read this book, that it tends to evoke a \\"love it or hate it\\" response.  Interesting when a book does that, isn't it?  So for those of you who loved it, I think that's great.  I wish it would have evoked that reaction in me.ough various conversations with others who have read this book, that it tends to evoke a \\"love it or hate it\\" response.

As a long time King fan from the 70's it pains me to say it but this would be a worthless piece of dreck even if it were written by someone trying to imitate King, let alone written himself.

0446572993|5.0|It's been awhile since I have written a review-no book has stood out for me to take the time.  This is the best book I have read for awhile. I know there will be negative reviews and we all have different tastes for sure but this one grabbed me from the first page to the last.  Normally in a book of this length I tend to skim some but didn't feel the need in this one.  Mr. Baldacci gives enough background without overdoing descriptions which I find boring if they are too lengthy.  I won't go into the synopsis but just to comment why I liked the book.  The main characters were all strong characters and you liked them.  I did figure out early on who was behind the plot but until nearly the end still didn't know how far reaching the plot was.  I think Mr. Baldacci tied the ending up well and as the main characters met for the last time gave us the why and how everything went down. When I come to the end of the book and feel like things have not been explained I'm somewhat disappointed.  If it's  a series I understand that but not a stand alone.  Will the author bring back Robie?  It's ok if he does or does not as this was a great stand alone book.  I read the library copy as I have so many good author's I enjoy, I couldn't possibly afford to buy them all. However, I think I will have to have this on my library shelf.<br /><br />I am always in awe of anyone who can put a book together and as i read this one I kept thinking what a gift to be able to put as many details together and have them work.  Is some of it  far fetched-maybe-maybe not but it's fiction and you can take liberties with fiction-that's what makes it so interesting.<br /><br />Hope you read the book and enjoy it as much as I did!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I loved these books every page held a different excitement, definitely an enjoyable read. You really build a bond with your favorite characters and hurt when they go through struggles. I loved all 3 books :)

0345803485|1.0|The Good: It doesn't take long to read<br /><br />The Bad: Everything from the timeline to the geography to the basic story arcs is ridiculous:<br />1) Virginal college co-ed meets young handsome billionaire, within 30 minutes billionaire is smitten with co-ed<br />2) FAST forward 1 week they are in bed together<br />3) FAST forwad 10 days he has bought her a car, a computer, a cell phone and a six figure wardrobe<br />4) FAST forward 16 days they are engaged<br /><br />At no time in the fortnight does anyone say \\"Wow this is going fast\\" or even \\"When did you guys meet?\\", instead everyone from the billionaires' psychiatrist (he is of course deeply flawed) to his parents are THRILLED with this 21 year old who has managed to turn this troubled young Adonis from sad to happy in less time than it takes a half gallon of milk to go bad in the fridge. Toss in angry flare ups from the hero and ridiculous pouting/self doubt from the heroine (sprinkle in a promotion from intern to editor after less than a week on the job for the talented young lady) and you have the kind of relationship that girls sit up nights in the dorm hallway analyzing.<br /><br />There was apparently no editor. The action jumps around and makes no sense as if she started writing one scene, got up to make lunch then picked up without rereading what she had read. Ana states \\"I was now on the top step and our eyes were even\\" but they are in a room in his house, they haven't left the room, are their random steps in the middle of the room? Ana goes outside in a short dress and muses that Grey is furious and she'll have to deal with him. But there had been no mentionof him being mad, I honestly thought I had missed a page wand went back to reread it. In one scene the car is the freeway, a few sentences later it is headed towards the freeway. The author has set the story in Seattle but bizarrely the only time she references the city are in details that are apropos of nothing: \\"we headed north on I-5\\" \\"I saw asign for 9th Ave NW\\" \\"we took exit 176\\" which add nothing to the story and make no sense if you know the city. So why even have those sentences there?<br /><br />The author has either never been out of her house or been around any trappings of money: as Christian pulls his yacht away from the dock a crowd gathers pointing and waving.  Boats pulling away are pretty much what happens at a dock.  At a fund raiser put on by Christians parents the host welcomes the guests with \\"Welcome to our charity ball\\" Even grade school auctions have names like \\"A Night to Remember\\" or \\"Spring Time in Paris\\" no one running a charity ball would call it \\"our charity ball\\"<br /><br />Don't get me started on the obviously bipolar Mr. Grey, who in the beginning of the book is so busy running an empire that encompasses cell phones, beauty salons and philanthropy that an interview with a student newspaper must be scheduled 6 months in advance yet can spend 23 hours a day having sex and on the rare occasions he goes to work spends all of his time sending emails with provocative subject lines and signatures.
1451629184|5.0|This book is definitly for adults only in my opinion...it was well written and I couldn't put it down, but it has some situations that are very hard to swallow and fathum anyone having to endure. Read with tissue.
B000001ELR|5.0|Best sound of any Kiss album or any album of all time. You must have this in your collection. Truly underrated. BEST DRUM SOUND of all time. It will blow you away. RIP Eric Carr. This album should have been Kiss's comeback instead of \\"Lick it up\\" but patience was a virtue and later on this one got it's kudos anyhow. Get this if you are a fan of Kiss or if you aren't. a true recording masterpiece. OK on to the songs:<br /><br />1.Creatures of the night 5/5-best title song of any Kiss album. Rocks the house down. AWESOME<br /><br />2.Saint and sinner 5/5-Kick-A** Kiss song. Gene's baby.<br /><br />3.Keep me coming 4/5-a Paul rocker, not my personal fave here but still kicks.<br /><br />4.Rock and roll hell 5/5-a song about Ace written by Gene with collaboration from Bryan Adams\\"yeah, that one\\" and Jim Vallance. AWESOME as well.<br /><br />5.Danger 4/5-another Paul rocker, more early Kiss. fast paced and although not a fave, not a bad song<br /><br />6.I love it loud 5/5-fist pumpin AWESOME hard rock anthem!!! I have a friend who is not a Kiss fan who loves this one. Best Kiss song in the 80s hands down!!!!<br /><br />7.I still love you 5/5-a great Paul ballad. The live version from unplugged is awesome.<br /><br />8.Killer 4/5-a very good Gene rocker, not a fav but not bad at all<br /><br />9.War machine 5/5-Gene at his best. An AWESOME song and awesome ending to the album. worth the price of admission. God of thunder II.

0345535421|4.0|A Clash of Kings (ACOK) picks up right where it's predecessor Game of Thrones left off.  The red comet seems to appear as a sky as a result of the birth of Daenerys' three dragons at the end of the previous book. This ominous sign in the sky is commented on by all of the point of view (POV) characters throughout the first third of the book, and this sign cannot help but  drive the subsequent actions by the characters.<br /><br />The prologue is certainly longer in  ACOK than Game of Thrones, but a lot of ground is covered.  The reader sees Stannis (albeit through the eyes of Maester Cressen) for the first time in this series, and he is clearly a curmudgeon that is seeking his due.  Stannis is pushing all his chips to the table by aligning himself with Melisandre, the red priestess.  The elderly Cressen tries to prevent Stannis from recklessly attacking the mainland, but here (and throughout ACOK) the faint of heart are pushed out of the way.  The long prologue is foreboding and tense throughout, and really sets the stage for what follows in the main narrative.<br /><br />The Stark family has been scattered throughout Westeros, and the narrative seems to be pulling the Stark POV characters even further apart from each other-Jon going deeper beyond the Wall, Arya and  Catelyn like two ships passing in the night without ever spotting each other,  Sansa remains trapped in King's Landing while Bran tries to rule in Winterfell.  None of these five Starks are in control of their travels, while the one Stark who does have some control (Robb) is only mentioned through other characters.  Honestly, I'm not sure why Martin kept Robb off-screen, especially where he is involved in some battles during ACOK.<br /><br />Davos' Seaworth's chapters are highly interesting, especially as it tries to explain why a former smuggler is so loyal to his lord that aspires to the throne.  Theon's initial chapter is quite funny, and sets up how he wants to prove himself throughout the remainderof the book.<br /><br />Initially, I did not find Daenerys' chapters as interesting, although her foray into the House of the Undying was quite well done.  I really enjoy how Martin peels off the onion layers of the Targaryen past through Daenerys' chapters.<br /><br />However, Tyrion is truly the one that dominates a lot of the action in ACOK.  Martin has created a fantastic character in Tyrion that resonates well beyond the scope of this series.  Tyrion makes himself a force to be reckoned with all characters (including his sister the regent) despite his small stature.<br /><br />About halfway through the book is building to a climactic battle, only for that opportunity to be snuffed out.  However, this only serves to create more tension leading up to the climactic battle of King's Landing.  The battle was quite riveting, especially as told through multiple viewpoints off the battlefield and on it.  Martin truly shines when writing this battle, and it's easy to see why he wanted to use books instead of television as his writing forum.<br /><br />The final chapter is a shattering aftermath of battle told through Bran's eyes.  I've never been a big fan of the Bran chapters, but this one resounds with the reader.<br /><br />This is a strong sequel to Game of Thrones that creates even more tension for Storm of Swords.  My only criticism is that some of Robb's actions should have been seen through a viewpoint character, but the bulk of the action was taking place in other locales.  Martin delivers another long yet tight narrative in the second book sating the reader for the moment....yet making the reader want to dive immediately into Storm of Swords.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This book grabs you from the opening scene.  Nice to have a female hero without having sex to sell the book or keep you turning the pages.  This is an excellent read for women of all ages (and men too).

0345803485|5.0|Ok I ll admit that i barely read the first book...I only started reading because I didn t understand what was all the fuss about. By the end of book one I wanted to know what will happen next... Amazing, Christian is the perfect guy and that is the perfect story, because in real life we are all like that... There is less sex in books 2 and 3, which is good, it s more about them and there relationship...<br />So if you hated the 1st book, pick up the 2nd..you ll be hooked like i was :)

B003E6K1VK|4.0|Received this unit a few months ago, so I've thoroughly vetted it at this point.<br /><br />For the most part, this amp does what it says it does. It does sound very good, I use it to power my Senn HD595's and it makes them sing. I also use it on my Klipsch X10 in ear headphones too, after driving the bigger and more capable HD595's driving the smalled X10's are like a walk in the park. The bass boost can be changed from 0-3 and it's a nice feature if you want to get that extra oomph out of some recordings that could use it.<br /><br />Fit and finish on the unit itself is fantastic. The presentation was also awesome. It comes in a small white box, clearly styled after the iPhone packaging. But unlike Apple's products, Fio sees fit to include a couple of awesome extras: a rubber case for everyday use, a small velvet drawstring carrying case, and an absolutely vital, you-didn't-even-know-how-much-you-really-needed-it-until-you-use-it thick black rubber band so that you can mate together the amp and your portable source device (in my case, my iPod touch or my iPhone). If you're having trouble picturing the rubber band, think of a Livestrong bracelet but in black instead of yellow.<br /><br />There's only 4 buttons, and it's easy to navigate the menus. I do like the OLED display a lot, although there's no way to shut off the display when it's not in use. This shouldn't be a battery drain problem though, since I believe OLED tech consumes very little power.<br /><br />But that brings me back to my only drawback on this unit, and it's a big one for me. The specs say that the internal lithium ion battery will provide 80 hours of use, and I have to wonder what kind of crack was being smoked when this spec was provided. I get about 5 hours of continuous use out of this unit, at an average volume of only about half of max volume. It also takes many hours to recharge fully, even when charging the unit off the wall instead of a trickle charge through a PC USB port.<br /><br />It's overall a fantastic unit, but the battery life and poor recharging is solely responsible for killing a star on this unit. It really irritates me that Fio promises 80 hours of continuous use, when in reality there's only about 4-5 hours. I don't know whether it's possibly a defective unit or if everybody at Fio just doesn't know how to use a stopwatch, but either way it's past the return window at this point.

0812550706|5.0|Its amazing that many people have not heard of this title.  although it has its moments where it lags - particularly toward the end its still in my top five science fiction books of all times. In terms of affection for the character  in the top two.  Scott Card created a masterpiece that personally I don't think he captured in any other work.
B003EYVXV4|5.0|This movie is awesome I'm surprised that the movie was a lot like the book except a few minor things. Especially that they had Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson. This movie was ment Both sexes yet it mainly attracts men because of the lovely Jennifer Lawrence. This is an action packed movie filled with love, deception, and murder. May this movie be ever in your hands.

B007RI56NY|5.0|This is seriously one of trains best albums! Its catchy lyrics and foot tapping beats will have you up singing and dancing in no time! Once you listen to this cd you just feel like your on a sandy beach in california with the sun beating down on you especially with tracks like \\"Mermaid\\" , \\"Sing Together\\" And of coarse \\"California 37\\". But since this train you can also excpet heart felt lyrcis in tracks like \\"When The Fog Rolls In\\",\\"We Were Made For This\\" And \\"Feels Good At First\\". If you loved Save Me San Francisco you will LOVE this album! It will have you laughing and crying! Trust me your not wasting your money at all buying this album it will have you at the first song! The only downside you'll find is the same downside i found.......Its so short! I enjoy it so much the time just seems to fly by when listening to it! Bottom line if you love train you need to get this album!
B0060MYNHI|5.0|Attention U.S. television producers; The BBC proves once again that Yes, it is possible to make a show that doesn't include tons of sex innuendo, bleeped or un-bleeped profanity, graphic, criminal violence, degrading and obnoxious humor and yet remain utterly appealing to adults. What Merlin does have is heroes and villains, magic and monsters, epic battles, exciting adventures... in other words just a great fantasy show set in an Arthurian milieu (kinda like Harry Potter meets Excalibur).<br /><br />Currently in its fourth season, this series isn't losing an ounce of momentum, on the contrary it has even greater potential for future seasons, particularly when you realize that the setting thus far has been limited to a relatively small geographical sphere. Not to mention that these characters have the potential to become more interesting as they continue to age which is the exact opposite of most series that attempt to keep their main stars perpetually young. Oh and ya, this show actually has main characters that are over the age of forty (gasp). Speaking of the characters, there's chemistry here, which is absolutely fundamental to a great TV show and made evident as the relationships continue to develop and/or change.<br /><br />Wasn't sure how the writers would handle the continuing themes of: \\"Merlin-in-the-box\\", Arthur & Gwen secret romance, Camelot power shift or Morgana as the arch-villain (doing a fabulous job of being beautifully creepy by the way) but so far it continues to be creatively believable while maintaining continuity with previous seasons. Additionally, we see Colin Morgan given the opportunity to really demonstrate his acting ability every time he dons the older Merlin persona (which is usually hillarious), as well as a decidedly more mature Arthur, which is kind of a welcome relief.  There's also more emphasis on the newer recurring roles; especially Sir Gwaine, my personal favorite, as well as Guinevere's brother Elyan, another good supporting actor, and then there's the deviously annoying Sir Agravaine (who I call \\"sir aggravate\\") as well as a couple of new characters introduced towards the end of this season which I think I'll let you find out about for yourself.<br /><br />Basically, a more mature season regarding characters and individual stories as well as a larger scope to the overall story-arc; my only complaint... I want more trolls!!!<br /><br />WARNING: Region one DVD's haven't been released yet at the writing of this review; I'm giving my opinion on the content not the container. Region two is already out because this is a UK series but please note that it will not play on US DVD players (look up \\"DVD region code\\" on wikipedia if you're not familiar with this concept).actor, and then there's the deviously annoying Sir Agravaine (who I call \\"sir aggravate\\") as well as a couple of new characters introduced towards the end of this season which I think I'll let you find out about for yourself.<br /><br />Basically, a more mature season regarding characters and individual stories as well as a larger scope to the overall story-arc; my only complaint...

It is not be for the faint of heart or for anyone who is prudish in the least! Make sure you have the 2nd book bought before you finish the first one IF you love what you are reading! Believe me you will want to start on book 2 immediately! Enjoy...or should I say Bon Appetite???

B00701897I|5.0|Weather you are a fan of Tintin, or never heard of him, this is a must have movie. There is 2 sequels apparently on the way, and I will buy them for sure. Buy 3D even if you don't have a 3D TV or player. It also comes with a 2D version, and you will have a 3D TV one of these days.
B006UG90RM|5.0|I wrote a review for \\"[[ASIN:B002CNSVTK For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge]]\\" and said some things about David Lee Roth that I'm now finding unwarranted. I listened to this album and noted that I unfairly judged DLR because of past albums. I own \\"[[ASIN:B0029LJ9IW Chickenfoot]]\\" and \\"[[ASIN:B005ELZKWS Chickenfoot III]]\\" and must admit that although Sammy Hagar may be a good lyricist, Chickenfoot is no VH.<br /><br />I also recently listened to old school pre-Hagar Van Halen and although all the songs seemed juvenile compared to Van Hagar, they all provided an atmosphere all their own, which makes this album a more return to form. This album makes it seem as though the Hagar and Cherone eras never happened.<br /><br />David Lee Roth sounds amazing ( I think he sounds great on \\"You And Your Blues\\"). and Wolfgang makes you hardly miss Michael Anthony and carves his own niche. Alex Van Halen Will Always Be Alex Van Halen!<br /><br />I cannot praise this album enough.

0345803485|5.0|Ok i have never read a romance novel in my life.  That being said, i was a little hesitate to read this when my friend lent it to me, assuming i wouldn't like it.  On the contrary, I LOVED it!  Overlooking the sex scenes, which to say the least are rather steamy, the story is really good.  James really knows how to get the reader to sympathize with the main characters, Christian and Ana.  I recommend this trilogy to everyone.
B0073XORCY|5.0|TAAB2 first impression. I think this will become something I listen to a lot more in the future. The concept Ian approaches with this is very interesting to me and poignant to my personal place in life. If you are expecting Thick As A Brick I you may be disappointed.<br /><br />If you are willing to take Ian's journey into Gerald's possible futures (pasts?) at this point there are many twists and turns and expansive ideas wound into this yarn. I like the notion of the different possibilities of Gerald Bostock winding up on different streets roads and parkways of the same streetname in the 'Kismet In Suburbia' track. Ian's poetry is always top notch and it is something that is often overshadowed by his virtuosity. Lean on flute and heavy on the acoustic guitar that is an equally overlooked aspect of his pallet. Maybe he intended to flip this script intentionally to address the attention of his storytelling on this one.<br /><br />TAAB2 is not time returned out of mind but Brick in time as it flows today. The lyrical allusions to Passion Play were not lost on me on 'Cozy Corner.' I wonder what former Gentle Giant frontman and record exec Derek Shulman thought of Ian's response to his press to continue Gerald's story?<br /><br />This album is an interesting departure from the modern journey of the venerable Tull but does pay attention to Ian's current direction as he is not one to rewrite what has been written though he will perfom the fire out of what has been done. I think it's a fresh twist for Ian and thoroughly enjoyed it but I may be more open minded than most. 'Swing It Far,' and make sure you listen to 'A Change of Horses' dig the glockenspiel.<br /><br />If you're expecting a bombastic rehashing of the original it isn't.  If you are a true Tull fan and still interested in some adventurous new music from Ian Anderson it is a must have.

0345803493|5.0|I loved the first book, but this one is even better!  There are more suspensful situations in this book, that sometimes left me holding my breath.  Also, you learn more about christian's past and really start to fall in love with the charaters.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I read that the author reads his Amazon reviews, so with that said, the Wool collection is an amazing piece of fiction that had me wondering how I had missed it until I saw that it only came out last year. Intrigue, mystery, suspense, and powerful characters, its got them all! Truly a must read for anyone with five bucks!
0345803485|1.0|The book has no storyline to it.  Where is the plot?  It lasted about 2 pages.  It's really sad when I have to start skipping through the \\"scenes\\" to get back to the story.<br /><br />Don't waste your time OR money.  I guess if you truly have no life, you could give it a try.  I wouldn't.
0345803485|1.0|Having heard about this over dinner w/some out of town girlfriends, they discussed at length the pros/cons of this Series and that it's erotica light. So I read the sneak peek before buying and Ugh. Why does the female character driving the story have to be written so dull witted and rather bland?<br /><br />The writing of Ana took a turn for the worse as she berated herself for not getting a \\"bio\\" on Mr. Grey. Hello?..if it's set in modern times, why the heck wouldn't she be a character who web searches the man, look up his bio, call his office, ask your iphone Siri to give you a background, whatev...it's a world of information out there - do some research. Suffice to say a college student who doesn't take 5 minutes to revise the questions and learn about her subject - Dumb.  She is painted as a ninny, who over-analyzes her every move and we should believe this high powered kinky man chooses Her?! why not pick the hot blonde secretary to dominate?<br /><br />Agreed with other reviews and I only scanned the provided pages..but I've read better of this genre. This appeals to the twilight/tweens, who unfortunately get rather poor representations of themselves instead of street smart, wise girls.

B004EPYZV2|1.0|I really enjoyed this movie in the teater and so I was excited to buy a blu-ray and digital copy, so that I could watch it in full splendour in HD at home, or on my iPad on the plane some time.<br /><br />The Ultraviolet web-site from Paramaount is most inconvenient, having you register and login more than once.  After that ordeal I discover that I am only albe to watch the digital copy on my iPad if I am connected to the internet, and that there is no way to download it in M4V format to play in iTunes.  To add insult to injury, if I want to watch it off-line I have to download and use the Paramount proprietary viewer, which means I can't stream it to my apple TV.<br /><br />I will never buy a \\"digital\\" copy of a movie again if it comes in this format and isn't natively compatible with iTunes.  Buyer beware!

B002M87V0A|4.0|This movie was a great movie.  It was played through a streaming devise.  Loaded without any problems.  However during the time it played it had to reload several times.

Her warmly realistic stories, sense of comedy and tragedy, and insights into human nature make the romance, humor and sweet stories of \\"Little Women\\" come alive.<br /><br />The four March girls -- practical Meg, rambunctious Jo, sweet Beth and childish artist Amy -- live in genteel poverty with their mother Marmee; their father is away in the Civil War. Despite having little money, the girls keep their spirits up with writing, gardening, homemade plays, and the occasional romp with wealthier pals. Their pal, \\"poor little rich boy\\" Laurie, joins in and becomes their adoptive brother, as the girls deal with Meg's first romance, Beth's life-threatening illness, and fears for their father's safety.<br /><br />The second half of the book opens with Meg's wedding (if not to the man of her dreams, then to the man she loves). Things rapidly go awry after the wedding, when Laurie admits his true feelings to Jo -- only to be rejected. Distraught, he leaves; Amy also leaves on a trip to Europe with a picky old relative. Despite the deterioration of Beth's health, Jo makes her way into a job as a governess, seeking to put her treasured writing into print -- and finds her destiny as well.<br /><br />There's a clearly autobiographical tone to \\"Little Women.\\" Not surprising -- the March girls really are like the girls next door. Alcott wrote them with flaws and strengths, and their misadventures -- like Amy's embarrassing problem with her huge lobster -- have the feeling of authenticity. How much of it is real? A passage late in the book portrays Alcott -- in the form of Jo -- \\"scribbling\\" down the book itself, and getting it published because it feels so real and true.<br /><br />Sure, usually classics are hard to read. But \\"Little Women\\" is mainly daunting because of its length; the actual stories flow nicely and smoothly. Don't think it's just a book for teenage girls, either -- adults and boys can appreciate it as well. There's something for everyone: drama, romance, humor, sad and happy endings alike.<br /><br />Alcott's writing itself is nicely detailed. While certain items are no longer in common use (what IS a charabanc anyway?), Alcott's stories themselves seem very fresh and could easily be seen in a modern home. And as nauseating as \\"heartwarming\\" stories sometimes are, these definitely qualify. Sometimes, especially in the beginning, Alcott is a bit too preachy and hamhanded. But her touch becomes defter as she writes on.<br /><br />Jo is the quintessential tomboy, and the best character in the book: rough, gawky, fun-loving, impulsive, with a love of literature and a mouth that is slightly too big. Meg's love of luxury adds a flaw to the \\"perfect little homemaker\\" image, and Beth just avoids being shown as too saintly. Amy is an annoying little brat throughout much of the first half of the book, but by her teens she's almost as good as Jo.<br /><br />\\"Little Women\\" is one of those rare classic novels that is still relevant, funny, fresh and heartbreaking today. Louisa May Alcott's best-known novel is a magnificent achievement.irls, either -- adults and boys can appreciate it as well.

B0042J6VUS|1.0|This item broke within 5 minutes of me removing the packaging. It is very brittle plastic, and the legs are more or less hollow, so it has very little stability or strength to even hold something as light as the iPhone. Go for something that has better materials - I should have done that to begin with.
B001HN6922|5.0|We love this movie. It is clever and fun, and the storyline is intriguing. If you have a toddler or preschooler you should know that there are parts that are a bit more intense than in the first movie. However, watching with mommy or daddy, my three year old loves it. Overall, a great movie.
B00785P2QC|5.0|nice game<br />me and my kids love this game we play this game all the time. love love love this game.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|great game to pass time and good to keep kids busy. don't do the update or you will lose all progress. recommended
B0072NWKEC|5.0|Gotta say that this is one of the very best 'Bernies' as I tell my poor wife, who wants me to turn out the light and go to sleep! Even my Kindle light I sometimes think.<br /><br />An Agatha Christie within an Agatha Christie within a palace full of confirmed murderers, Kerr not only fills us in on a bit of tragic history (my Kindle was going nuts as I kept switching between the narrative and Wikopedia to look up characters and events), but truly puts Bernie in his element. Smart, observant, funny and, yes, a soft touch. Oh, and its no surprise that he lives to investigate another day.<br /><br />What I also liked about this one is its focus. We're not in Eastern Europe one minute, off the shores of Cuba on the next, somewhere on a train. This gives him time to fill out his characters<br />(can there be worse ones than Heydrich and Frank?)and even learn a sad lesson or two.<br /><br />Oh, and as another reviewer said one can pick this up and read it without worrying about where one is in the progression of novels. In fact, I like the fact that Kerr is going back and filling in some blanks in such a clean way.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game is fun, addicting and amazing! it always keeps me busy andi love how the charcters i grew up with are in there
0451232577|5.0|I love reading epic novels and Follett is a real pro at it.  I was not disappointed.  After 1000 pages I still did not want it to end.  I plan on reading it over again before Book Two is released.  Follett is a great storyteller as well as a historian of facts keeping the story real and educational in a story format. I am so looking forward to Book Two release in September 2012.  Can't come too soon for me.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This was a great Faotd. I loved it. A ton of levels and some can get challanging. Finally! NO ADS! I will keep playing this game. I reccomend Quell Reflect also. Both great games.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This is really neat app play Skyrim with its great and very versatile but the only thing is it wont pick up my xbox
030788743X|5.0|I was really pleasantly surprised by this book, but then again, I'm not sure I knew what to expect.  I echo the sentiments of the reviewer who called this book a \\"nerdgasm.\\"  If you have ever played Dungeons & Dragons, are a Star Wars fan, or into Arcade games, then you will love this book - but it has an appeal much broader than the so-called \\"Freaks & Geeks\\" demographic.  I grew up in the 80s, so the nostalgia was fun, and Cline whips out some pretty obscure references, while at the same time not making the reader feel \\"out of the loop\\" if they're not familiar, and the same for the references to D&D and old movies.<br /><br />One could say the \\"corporate conglomerate as villain\\" is a bit cliche, but it works here.<br /><br />As for Cline's writing - the devil is in the details.  He is so descriptive and visual, that the whole time I read this book all I could think of was how I couldn't wait for the movie.  He does a great job of really bringing you into the narrator's world, which is interesting because he's immersed in a virtual world himself.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I enjoy the game. cant always go to another village. its fun and addicting. I have no problems with the game. good app to kill time with or lose track of!!
B006M4F67A|5.0|This is the second mahjong that I have downloaded. The first was nice in that the back grounds were colorful and varied from level to level,  but it only added shuffles after you got to higher levels plus you loose and add lives. This game is much more relaxed and my very young grandsons can play with some guidence. I definitely recommend. This app.
B001C4CI8U|1.0|I'm a huge fan of \\"The X-Files,\\" so I had high hopes for \\"Fringe\\" since \\"Fringe\\" is virtually a re-make (or) copycat of \\"The X-Files.\\"  Given that set-up, I was quite surprised then when I found myself bored out of my mind most of the time struggling to get through Season 1.  The main problem is the show is SLOW and plodding, hence it made me bored.  Also, most of the stories I found mediocre, some flat out bad, really bad.  The main character, Olivia Dunham, I found uninteresting (and) Peter, the supposed 190 IQ super genius I found grating and also a bore (and, oddly, he doesn't appear excessively smart most of the time).  Fortunately I did like the third wheel character, Dr. Walter Bishop, somewhat (he's quirky and has some good lines).  He was the only minor redeeming element of the show.  The acting is only okay, the actors forced to work with mediocre scripts, so not entirely the actors faults that their acting isn't great.  Writing obviously sub-par.  Camera work bad.  Editing bad.  SFX okay-ish.  Music forgettable.  So, overall a major disappointment.  I waited a long time to buy this on DVD and get into it, thinking I would eagerly watch seasons 1-3 over the course of a few weeks and relish them like I did watching much of the \\"Lost\\" series on DVD.  That won't happen after the disappointment of Season 1.  I can say with 100% certainty that I will never waste my time ever again watching anymore \\"Fringe\\" shows.
B0034G4P4O|3.0|Tintin was a very good movie, but it had too much violence with guns and swords.  It was a good mystery, but grownups should watch the movie first to see if it is to violent for their kids.
B000Q66JXA|1.0|This is a decent B movie.  Interesting because of some of the early roles of some now-famous people - Liam Neeson, Patrick Stewart,Helen Mirren, etc.  The acting was pretty bad across the board.  Storyline was OK, but how could that be screwed up? Interesting because this King Arthur seemed to be a weasely guy with few redeeming qualities.  A lot of clanking armor plate without any reality of what wearing armor does to weigh down the body.  Knights going about the countryside in armor without anyone to help them get the armor off or to get it back on.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|This reader app does exactly what I needed it to. The stock kindle fire pdf reader is good, but lacks the functionality I needed for large pdf's. This app allows me to save bookmarks, notes, share, and enable links. I haven't found it to run any slower yet. hope this info helps!
B0059XTUVI|1.0|I don't have a problem with Meryl Streep.  She turned in her usual outstanding performance and deserves the Oscar.  Certainly she didn't have much to work with.  The screenplay was awful!<br /><br />The movie opens with Thatcher as an elderly woman.  Then it flashes back to her childhood, when she got into Oxford and when she met Denis Thatcher.  My problem is the back and forth between elderly woman and MP and Prime Minister.  They spent too much time on her as an elderly woman and less on her rise in Parliament.  Also, they kept bringing Denis' ghost back after he died and that really confused things!<br /><br />Don't waste your money buying this.  Nothing against Streep, but she should have had some input into the screenplay.  They didn't touch much on her political career at all.  They didn't explore her friendship with Reagan or her relationship with the Queen.  Get this on DVD.  It's not worth the money and I wish I hadn't bouught it.  I couldn't even finish it!
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|this game is fun. really great with time . share with kids to keep it going when I'm not on.glad it let you know when things are ready
B00514HDNW|4.0|I decided to read this book because it's a classic in the genre, it basically gave form to the modern zombie. Although the word vampire is used in this book, and aspects of vampire lore (garlic, crosses, etc..), the behavior of the \\"afflicted\\" is really what later characterizes the zombie.<br /><br />The author's writing is superb, he creates great vivid imagery and you really get inside the mind of the main character, Robert Neville. Since I felt I knew the character so well I found it hard to put down the book. How can he survive alone in a world where everyone else seems to be infected and wanting eat his flesh and drink his blood? How long can he stay boarded up in his house while the \\"vampires\\" try to break in night after night?<br /><br />When you have finished the book you will understand the meaning of the title, and the real meaning of the book. For fans of horror, zombies, etc... it's a definite must. If not just for its historical value in the genre.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|glitches made timers crazy long the first time.  didn't get very far but since something happend thought I would give it another shot.  have high hopes :)
B004LROUW2|3.0|I'm a fan of most of Murakami's work, but I think it's interesting that this one has gotten more positive press than most. It isn't a terrible book, but as the 1,000-page volume released in the U.S., it's too long, and it's too repetitive. And above all, it's not his best - try \\"The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle\\" or \\"A Wild Sheep Chase\\" or \\"Kafka On The Shore\\" for similar, more-streamlined work. Nonetheless, Murakami's best trait is probably his ability to create bizarre, meandering dreamscapes in his work - though don't expect everything to get wrapped up in a nice, neat little package at the end. A good book to check out at the library, not to buy.
B007U8U1V8|5.0|Already hooked on every song. Some of the riffs are very close to White Stripes songs, yet the music is very different.  My one disappointment is that I pre ordered the cd as well as the vinyl, because it did not look like Amazon was going to offer a digital download, so now I am waiting to receive it in the mail and listening on youtube.
6305291446|5.0|Purchased as part of the series.  Love these movies and wanted to own the entire set!  Very happy with the price, shipping and product!  Will purchase more!! :)
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is the first book I have read in 18 years I am 64 years of age and was delighted that the author was able to write about sexual activities  and yet not make it smutty and still have a great storyline.
B003UESJJC|5.0|One of my fav movies!  Wanted to get movie on dvd - what a great price and deal for a great 3-pc set!  Very happy and highly recommend!!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|love this game my 4 yr old grandson loves it I use my Kindle Fire and have had 0 problems with it! when my grandson comes over he runs in gives me hugs and kisses and than goes for my Kindle and this game he always wants to buy acorn packages to...GREAT GAME
0345803507|2.0|Okay, the book had awesome sex, I have to remember they are in their 20's, and sex all the time isn't unusual at that age. But, didn't you get annoyed with Anna?  I thought she deserved getting hickys from Christian.  It angered me when she would promise Christian and then break her word. I agree it is good to stay your own person, but I didn't like how she drove him crazy arguing with him. It was her fault the security team was compromised because she wanted have drinks with Kate! Plus, how dumb could Anna be not getting her shots and then getting pregnant?  Christian wanted to have children later in their marriage. Honestly, I quit reading the book at that stage, I did finish later but I was really disgusted with her.  Then, had to throw the book down again when she goes off to save Mia, how dumb.  And, it annoyed me that she was always \\"glaring\\" at him and being so snippy.  I just wish Anna's character was not such an argumentative hard head!  Christian was compromising more than she was. E L James, what were you thinking, car chases, kidnapping, early pregnancy? It got ridiculous, big disappointment to the end of the series.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This is probably one of the best free apps for use on the kindle. It's very useful for offline work, very flexible with different types of files and sharing projects, and, best of all, it's free!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|fun game a little addictive but fun wish it was not friend dependent though other then that fun game great graphics
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I got to ignore the small control problems - don't place items too close or you won't be able to collect or move. I saw the energy losses as breaks. But at level 35 I've had the time warp crash mentioned in other reviews. I can't gather anything since the times jumped from minutes to weeks and I earn no energy either. The great reviews are from people who rate an app after 5 minutes instead of 5 days.
B006BG7RI0|5.0|Who cares about the extra documentary features, or the coasters, poster and all the \\"what-not\\" that comes with this handsomely designed box set.  It's CASABLANCA! 'nuff said.
B0071T5PN0|4.0|This album has grown on me. She's the Woman and You and Your Blues are cool tunes. Bullethead is cool old school Halen. Eddie is shredding on this disc. The final tracj Beats Workin' is good. I like the whol album.
B002RAR18U|4.0|Excellent book.  Should end up being very helpful with the mental aspect of the game.  Great detail with the Zen approach to sports.
B004SOR4H6|1.0|The twitter app I have for my Kindle Fire is currently having issues. You aren't able to change your profile picture and it doesn't show all of your followers. Please tell me if there is a way to fix this.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have used this Bible app in different forms over the years and it has been a real blessing to me. I currently use it everyday for study and lesson prep. Easy to use and multiple translations are a real help. I am thankful for having the opportunity to use it.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is amazing just like Oregon settler of course cause it is by the same people Love It So Much
B005KELW26|4.0|We've had this since literally before our Kindle Fire's 'day one' because our daughter hoped for a cover that came in purple. But there's more to this cover than just a color.<br /><br />BUILD AND DESIGN<br /><br />- Made of good quality leather. After almost half a year of use it continues to look good.<br />- Similarly good quality black velvet-like interior lining.<br />- Very easy to take your Fire in and out of the cover.<br />- The magnetic tab allows for quick and easy open/close.<br />- The inside pocket allows for keeping a cleaning cloth handy.<br />- There's sufficient space on the spine to clip a little stylus.<br /><br />OPERATION<br /><br />The Fire is grabbed safely at the 4 corners with leather-covered elastic clasps. For normal use you simply open the cover like you would a book. All the ports and buttons are easily accessible and you can charge your Fire with the cover open or shut. For viewing, the front cover folds underneath but it should be understood that this cover does not turn itself into a viewing stand.<br /><br />RATING<br /><br />The good quality finish/materials, the magnetic clip and the inner pocket are all major pluses and Belkin's Verve comes very close to 'perfect' if rated as a cover only. However, I happen to believe that a cover's ability to transform into a viewing stand is almost a must-have feature these days, especially for a tablet like the Fire which is meant to be used mostly for media consumption. For that reason I am rating the Verve as a 4-star, not a 5-star.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I love to read a good romance and this book delivers albeit with a bit of light erotica thrown into the mix which I thought helped explain a bit about the psyche of Christian quite well.  However, this book is a love it or hate it type of book.  I happened to love it.  I don't write review very often but thought this one definitely deserved one. I wish I could give it 4.5 stars because it wasn't quite perfect but close enough!  Love me some Christian Grey!
B007UXSPK2|5.0|I rented the movie on Amazon Instant Videos and was expecting a good time.<br /><br />The movie had gotten some rave reviews, and my expectations were high.<br /><br />Three words:  GET IT NOW.<br /><br />It is a fun, exciting ride of a movie and if you like fast paced action/adventure then you cannot miss this one.<br /><br />There were hold-your-breath moments as well as moments of gasping, and I am still panting!
B0034DGPEU|3.0|When I first read the description of the book, I was intrigued.  It started out great but after a while, it was very repetitive.  I stayed with it to appease my curiosity and found the later part of the book to be exciting - not sure what was going to happen.  I don't think I would strongly recommend this book to anyone though.
0307593312|1.0|Was it worth the time and effort to chip away those 950 pages of dross to get at the handful of gold?<br /><br />No.
0062060562|3.0|Though the plot was intriguing, I felt by the middle of the book I was in a 'Groundhog's Day' moment.  I was too invested at that point to stop reading, but it was an effort to finish.  And the end?  I didn't see it coming and barely missed it as it was so abrupt.  After all that detail, it was over.
B001HM1PFO|4.0|I really do love this movie it is a lot of fun.  I wanted it to be as pristine as possible so I got the bluray. This is an old film that is designed to look even older.  But the sound is absolutely great
B007J4T2G8|1.0|After hearing that this book was on hold at my local library for about a year, I had to pick up a copy and see what all the talk was about. From the way women were going crazy over this \\"love story,\\" I expected a modern day erotic classic. After reading a few pages, I had to look around for Ashton Kutcher because I thought I was on Punk'd. I kept reading because I thought something was going to happen to make it the story worthy of the attention it is getting. At around half-way through, I gave up and raised the white flag. There is so much wrong with this book that I'm not sure where to even begin.<br /><br />The writing is horrific. Ana is repetitive (Holy Crap! Holy Cow! Holy This! Holy That!), whiny, and downright dumb. I found myself begging her \\"Inner Goddess\\" to go away. Referring to parts of her body the way a five year old would was...creepy. I felt no connection at all to any character in this book because the author doesn't know how to build a character. They are one-dimensional stereotypes -- the innocent virgin, the rich bad boy (I'm using that phrase because Amazon won't allow me to print what he really is), the knock-out roommate, and the groveling ethnic boy in love with the virgin who won't give him the time of day. I honestly have no clue how this was published or what anyone was thinking to make this become a top-selling book.<br /><br />On to the actual \\"plot\\" - the fact that a college-educated grown woman is giggling and acting like a deer stuck in headlights while a man is treating her like garbage is appalling. And the public reaction to this book? Women swooning over Christian Grey -- what?! Are you kidding me? I am by no means an in your face feminist - I'm all for a guy opening a door for me, etc. - but ..what?! This is a man you would want your daughter to meet? This is someone you would give the time of day? This is a man to glamorize? I can't get through a news feed on Facebook without someone naming the dreamy men they want to play Christian in the movie. Too bad Ted Bundy isn't alive -- he would have been fabulous.<br /><br />I'm disgusted. And that's all I have to say about this book.
0439023513|1.0|*Warning SPOILERS*<br /><br />  I am very disappointed o how the last book turned out.  The Katniss from the Hunger Games and Catching Fire stole our hearts with her courage and fire.  By the third book she's nothing more than a babbling, half-conscious seventeen year old on morphling, who passes out every time something epic begins.<br /><br />  Most of the book's structure consisted of quick summaries given to Katniss after she wakes up, Katniss mopping around unsure of herself, and Katniss feeding fake lines to a camera crew.  The deaths were either unnecessary or not well played out.  *SPOILERS*  For instance, Finnick's death isn't noble and is barely mentioned or thought over by Katniss.  Such a strong, intelligent main character didn't deserve a meager two paragraphs and a very unnecessary (his death didn't protect anyone or help the cause) death.  Another VERY UNNECESSARY death was Primrose's.  The entire series started with Katniss protecting her sister and within the last fifty pages Prim is randomly placed on the battlefield to be a medic, which Katniss noted she isn't old enough to do, with no explanation and is blown to pieces because of a bomb, that could have been designed by Gale.<br /><br />  Which leads to two more things: Gale's character and the watering down of many personalities.  After Gale may have killed Prim Katniss and him have one last conversation and suddenly we find out Gale has a fancy job in Distinct 2 and may be kissing someone else's lips.  No details.  Not even a lousy goodbye from Katniss' best friend...or even a visit.  Not to mention by this time many character's lost the personalities they once had.  Annie who was on the verge of insanity doesn't even have a strong reaction to Finnick's death.  In fact, at a meeting she merely mentions it as if she was somehow over it.  The Annie we knew from before is completely gone and unaccounted for.  Effie comes back with a vacant look in her eye, no explanation as to why, and acts the same.  We never find out Johanna's backstory, Beetee just ends up working somewhere, and Peeta somehow magically gets over hating Katniss within the last page of the last chapter.  The slow changes we saw in Peeta fit before but at the end everything becomes vague and it's merely mentioned that Peeta and Katniss grow close again.<br /><br />  The Epilogue was a sick joke.  All the questions, simple ones to answer, that we are left with are NEVER answered.  The Epilogue consists of a very vague description of Katniss' children playing on a meadow that is actually a mass grave.  She thinks about how one day she will have to explain everything that happened.  That's it.  No details about her mom, Gale, Peeta, OR even the government.  The books manages to answer yes there is a new president it's Paylor, a character mentioned twice before, and that is it.  Nothing about reform or how the new system works.  Nothing.  Just, \\"Oh, there's a president.\\"<br /><br />  This novel fell short of many things it could have lived up to.  One could argue the deaths that happened were necessary but most were barely thought over and if they were they were not well displayed. Also, the questions left unanswered weren't amusing or thought-provoking, they were just empty holes left in the plot. I felt Katniss lacked the spark she once had and became more of a spineless girl who didn't know what was going on.  Katniss was displayed stronger than that, able to be the Mockingjay but instead she was a puppet on strings who sometimes did her own thing which ended up uselessly killing others.<br /><br />  Katniss never even has to figure out who to chose: Gale or Peeta.  Gale just leaves so she's left with Peeta.  Yes, in the last paragraphs she realizes he would have been the right choice the whole time, but there was nothing to show the progression in her thoughts.  I feel like Collins was rushed into publishing the last novel and that is why it is lacking so much.  Had she just explained more things, put details into what really matter like the fighting and not Katniss mopping, and kept the personalities she started with the novel would have been alright.  I do not recommend getting emotional invested in this series.  It will fall short to expectations for a thrilling, last part of a trilogy.
B005N0C0JQ|5.0|I purchased this CD when it first came out. I decided to wait before I posted my review. I have not been disappointed. It's one of the few albums that I have purchased recently that I do not skip any songs. I prefer the Japanese version, A Simple Game of Genius is an awesome track.
B006JPS1OM|3.0|I really liked this game but there are things they need to fix that is why the 3 star rating. As stated before you have to press an item several times before it works. it does run slow as well.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this was a very fun game could not put it down each game brought different challenges would reccomend this game to anyone trying to pass the toke
B006OOHYIC|4.0|Lovely graphics,  relaxing music.  Challenging game,  with enough hints to keep you from getting frustrated.  The main downfalll is the nagging to leave a review,  even on the apaid version. Thus the deduction in stars. Almost annoying enough to make it 3 stars.
0307949486|5.0|First half was super boring, but the second half was great.  At the end of the day, the girl with the dragon tattoo is a genre book that transcends the genre and becomes much more.  The characters are real and lovable (yes, this tattooed girl is incredibly sympathetic and lovable and one can't help but be drawn to here).  The plot, once it picks up, is compelling and fast paced.  Not to be missed.<br /><br />Once you read this book, check out the movies--both the Swedish version and the US version.  Both are different in style and execution, but both are very good.
0062119044|2.0|I really wanted to like this book.  At times, it seemed to address the unspoken difficulties that many women have in becoming mothers - not so much the difficulty in giving up freedom and career, which is already well-documented in many fiction and non-fiction works and is an accepted subject- but the challenge of becoming a person who loves a child.  It's supposed to be easy to love one's child, but is it always?  The book is brilliant and brave when it addresses this subject, but it addresses it so infrequently that I lost interest.  The bulk of the book is dedicated to recounting, in tedious and intricate sentences, one woman's perception of herself, her son, her life.  She (Eva) is tiresome and tiring.  I suppose the pompous, overly-long sentences are meant to be indicative of Eva's personality (she's egocentric, thinks the whole world wants to hear her every thought) but it's really, really dull, and I wondered whether the author's other works are similarly written.  The book also failed to raise the nature-nurture question as promised.  It's impossible to discuss this question with only one viewpoint on offer as it's told entirely through her (really long and stale) letters to an estranged husband.  This device, by the way, struck me as really lazy \\"storytelling\\" ... the letters were clearly addressed to the reading audience, and not the husband, as they are chiefly expositive, and not at all what a person might say to an intimate.  The device also allowed the author to get away with dishing out the story without any real narrative structure.  The book had real strength in its atmosphere - it's chilling and even page-turning (at points) despite the obsessively detailed writing - and when it discussed Eva's obvious dislike of her own child.  I was very surprised that she and her husband, who clearly had the resources, didn't get expert advice when it was so obviously needed, but perhaps the author intended that as (further?) evidence of their deficiencies as parents.  I was also stunned when she decided to have Celia.  There was nothing in the story (though the hand-made toys and books for Kevin were impressive) that indicated she enjoyed being a parent and wanted to continue the role.
0345803485|1.0|I don't understand the huge publicity this book is getting. I am 70 percent through and it's boring. There isn't an interesting story line. The sex scenes aren't great. Read review for the next book which gave insight into Christian, and I am deciding to quit right here. There are much better books out there. I just wasted 1/2 day with this.

B004O86JZ4|5.0|I love this album, the sound is different from usual Foo Fighters, but it's still loveable. I've grown up Foo Fighters, so I don't think I could dislike them in any way, shape or form.

6305428050|5.0|I grew up near Chicago, so all the landmarks in the movie are spot-on. And the Chicago blues number is brilliant, sung by the babysitter and her charges in a South Side Chicago blues club. This movie was one of my kids' all-time favorites when they were in primary and middle school. It was just scary enough, just exciting enough. The children being babysat, the babysitter, the babysitter's lost and confused friend, the borderline criminal kid with the heart of gold, the grumpy auto mechanic, and everyone else in this adventure is treated with respect. The story zips along with just the right amount of suspense. There is enough visual action to keep the kids engaged, and there is dialog that asks them to pay attention to the words. It has a happy ending, which means everyone can go to sleep after seeing this movie, which is sometimes an issue in choosing films for children to watch. I can't remember how many times we watched this movie, and enjoyed it every time.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Works pretty well on kindle fire. Only drawback is it force closes occasionally. Very cute and addicting. Good game for al ages!!!!!!
B004O3YGMC|4.0|works well. I haven't had any serious uses of the program.But does as advertised , I've got full use of my computer and will do anything I request..The big stipulation is that the screen on my computer must be active..It will not reactivate the screen once the computer is in sleep mode.

Even if you're not, you will enjoy this book. I could not set this book down. Loved it from start to finish, 5 stars all the way. READ THIS BOOK!
B004TI5N38|4.0|This was a very good book.  It was my first time read David Baldacci, so maybe my expectations were too high.  Sometimes the plot seemed a bit unrealistic but all in all I enjoyed it.
B004XN3FHA|5.0|I've never had a serious flashlight before, but after reading \\"Solo Living 101,\\" I decided that since my husband travels frequently, I should equip myself with a few \\"portable protectors\\" like a safety whistle, pepper spray and a \\"tactical\\" flashlight, in addition to reinforcing my old windows and doors. After spending several hours poring over the dozens of great-looking flashlights offered by Amazon, I finally settled on the Fenix TK41 because the feedback is truly stellar, and there's a ton of it. I received my TK41 last week and couldn't wait till nightfall so I could try it out. Well, all I have to say is, it may be expensive, but it's definitely worth it. Not only does it feel solid and balanced in my hand, but it comes in a tough little plastic case with accessories and spare parts, it's a breeze to operate, and it easily outshines any other flashlight I've personally ever seen. Its 800 lumens would temporarily blind a would-be assailant or burglar so I could take other appropriate action. Plus, the next time one of my dogs takes off into the woods late at night, I'll go after her myself armed with my TK41--IF I can pry it out of my husband's hands.

B0064BWE8U|5.0|Who said Chick Lit is dead? They obviously haven't read Sophie Kinsella's page turning delight I've Got Your Number.<br /><br />My daughter recommended it to me, and I started reading it straight away. I loved it from the very first paragraph. The author throws you into the story immediately and the reader becomes connected straight away with the ups and downs of Poppy's road to the altar.<br /><br />This novel fizzed and bubbled with little twists and turns, and although I did suspect the way the romance would end, I had no idea how it was all going to be pulled together. In fact, there were so many times I thought Poppy had dug herself into a hole she would never be able to get out of. It's credit to the author that she could think of those wonderful ARGH moments for heroine Poppy, and to come up with ways to bring her through them.<br /><br />By the last chapter, I started to imagine I've Got Your Number on the big screen. It's just that kind of book.<br /><br />Don't want to give anything away, but if you love chick lit, or if you just feel like a bit of frothy fun, give I've Got Your Number a read. I zipped through it, and will actually miss Poppy and her mishaps now that I've finished. She was just that type of character.<br /><br />Well done Sophie!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|The Downton Abbey video for the Kindle Fire is an extremely convenient way to see my favorite British television show over and over again !  It is really great !
055277832X|1.0|that this is the SAME book, then entitled Confessions of a Shopaholic, that started the whole series--just re-published in 2012 with a different title.  This is a disingenuous move by the author and publisher, and tricks the reader (read some of the other reviews) into thinking that Sophie Kinsella has written a NEW book for the widely popular series.  I'd rate less than 1 star if I could. Bad form!
B004478GNI|5.0|My son loves this, it was a blast to put together with my son and he is 6 years old. I like it because there was a lot to do and put together. It really teaches him how important it is to follow directions and with patience (there are a lot of pieces) you get something really awesome looking. He enjoys the droid and the pilot a lot too. This will be great for any Star Wars Lego fan which at this point is starting at least around 5-6 years old. I also bought another as a birthday gift for my son's classmate and he enjoyed it too. Hope this review helps!
B0016Q2D5M|5.0|I bought this because we were in a motel and either caught the or had to miss the last hour of the movie when we were away from home. So we ordered it and it came very quickly and in very good condition. No problems when we watched it either.

B003OCFJ7U|4.0|For those familiar with the filmmaker, the overall atmosphere, plot and musical score will be instantly recognizable.  It's a bit weak in some areas like sound editing, but the acting and development of the movie helped compensate for such flaws.  If you're a Jennifer Connelly fan, you'll enjoy seeing her as a very young actress.

078322737X|1.0|In these times of being broke, I have checked out a few DVDs from the local libraries. One of them that I checked out was the 1973 film American Graffiti, which has to rank as one of the most overrated movies of all time. Not only is it overrated, but it is so out of whack in terms of cars, music, Wolfman Jack, and just about everything else. This movie drives me crazy because there is NOTHING that even approaches authenticity. It's like looking at a Revolutionary War movie and seeing the soldiers wearing wristwatches.<br /><br />Granted, 1950s cars were still on the road in 1962 and driven by teens, but they weren't restored cars like these were, cars that could have appeared in Reno's Hot August Nights celebration or at Harrah's car collection. By the 1970s, collectors were getting interested in the classic fifties models, and so more and more these cars were being collected and restored. The cars should have looked far more worn in this movie to look realistic enough to be owned by high school students. There should have been more early sixties model cars in the flick to add to the realism.<br /><br />And then there was the music. I heard only a couple of songs on the soundtrack that were actually recorded during the years of 1961-1962; the vast majority of them were strictly fifties numbers. Kids in 1962 were listening to the current hits and less on the oldies; in fact, there weren't actually oldies stations out there on the AM dial. Top 40 hits were the rule then. The least George Lucas could have done was write to Billboard (since there was no such thing as the internet at the time) for a list of the top hits of 1961 and 1962. For that matter, Wolfman Jack is out of place in this film, for he wasn't even on the West Coast, and nowhere near Modesto but near the California-Mexican border, until 1963. This was the beginning of his famous reign as the king of oldies radio at XERF, later XERB. I used to listen to him religiously in the late 1960s and early 1970s,which by then he was nationally and internationally known. Therefore, most of the music is out of place for the time depicted in the film. The early sixties was the era of the Four Seasons, the Beach Boys (\\"Surfin Safari\\" and \\"All Summer Long\\"--released in 1964--were used in the film), the girl groups, Chubby Checker, and many other acts that Lucas could have used for the soundtrack had he bothered to do his homework.<br /><br />Didn't Lucas even bother to look at high school yearbooks from 1962? Most of the characters in this movie are dressed like \\"Rebel Without a Cause\\" rejects instead of wearing the types of clothes teens wore in the early sixties. They did NOT dress like they did in the fifties. The hairstyles are mostly \\"off\\" for both sexes.<br /><br />I guess none of that matters when Lucas was trying to make some kind of sociological point in the film. To heck with authenticity when you're trying to make a point. I guess I am too picky when I watch films that are so brazenly unauthentic that I can barely stand to look at them. Not even the excellent performance by Mackenzie Phillips could save this dreck.<br /><br />\\"American Graffiti\\" doesn't belong on ANY \\"top 100\\" list of great films.  If you want to see a film about alienation of youth or the passage of youth or whatever pretentious idea Lucas was trying to get across, \\"Rebel Without a Cause\\" from 1955 is in every way a far superior film.
B007Q2N0HA|3.0|Great book if you liked fifty shades because it is the exact same story line as fifty shades! Every thing is similar. Nothing changed except the location and character names
B002OMZTSU|5.0|I can only imagine the pain that must have been closely associated with writing this book.  There were spots within the book that called upon raw emotion - I laughed, I cringed, I shook my head in wonder and yes there were a few tears that came close to falling (okay I'll admit to a few real tears.)<br /><br />The book is well written, easy to read and hard to put down.  It is not the spectacle of a train wreck that draws your attention, but the real definition of one man's struggle and the impact he had on countless others.<br /><br />If you have experienced a life with an individual who suffers from addiction I am of the opinion this book may provide a ray of hope - not a map of how to cope or actions to take to correct the problem, but a sure knowledge that life and love of life can prevail.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book and hope you feel the authors love of life as I did.
B006OAB3ME|5.0|I honestly love this album. Not it's not the Beatles, not it's not wings. It's something that I've  never heard him sing or perform  prior to this. I simply love it from the memories in my own life of music loved by grandparents, parents, and listening to their albums when I was a child. I love that he had the courage to do this and it's very classy and very heartfelt. If you are looking for rock and roll forget it<br />It's Paul singing with his heart on his sleeve. If you can watch the video it's even more touching with the fantastic backup and others as Eric Clapton< Diana Krull , Stevie Wonder and more. It's a different side, and it's soooo relaxing and peaceful, and it's nice to feel my heart warmed. I love what this man has given to me and all of us during his whole life. He's an amazing man and talent.  Thank You Paul!

1594484805|1.0|Offer a reward for a task and people will often do worse. An interesting piece of information but, it took me a couple of hundred pages to realize that Pink has nothing add.<br /><br />**ammended** Heidi Halvorson's \\"Succeed\\" does, in fact, succeed where the Pink book fails.<br /><br />What Pink offers is the usual fare: the establishment is hiding the truth, American business is wrong.

It's not the same as letting Google employees do their own thing.<br /><br />I managed to get through most of the book, hoping for some insight, when I came across one of Pink's most boneheaded ideas: Items to add to our 'to do' list (re-examine you purpose, etc.)<br /><br />Adding to our task list will help with motivation?

061891868X|5.0|Smolin's effort is outstanding. In this excellent book, contemporary physics is described in a simple but brilliant way. I also read Brian Greene's books and I think that Smolin has the same capacity of making difficult concepts clear to the large audience, but in contrast to that, Smolin also tackles the much more challenging task of understanding what's wrong with today's science. I totally disagree with the comments of people who didn't enjoy the final part, I actually think it's what makes this book so good, deep and unique. Smolin makes a genuine, non ideological effort to understand why science today is not making any significant progress, he gives a very interesting epistemological definition of what science is and how it should work, and makes a brilliant analysis of the world of academics, whose mechanism can be better explained with sociology than in any other way. Smolin also helps the reader to understand what happened historically, how the transition took place from Einstein's rigorous style of doing physics, till to the contemporary transformation of science into a dogmatic, religious community. The world of academics resembles more and more to a clan in the hands of powerful, established professors, and therefore any attempt to bring innovation is made much more difficult than what it should be. Science has become a matter of power, fashion, economical survival, so can we still call it science? Shouldn't we be worried of what's going on? The critic towards string theory take a significant part of the book but fits within this frame rather than being a critic to the theory itself. I think Smolin couldn't be more objective on that, and he certainly masters the topic like nobody else. A long-awaited-for book, absolutely a must for those who care about the future of science.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I sort of have no words to describe how i feel about this book. I'm not exactly what it is about it that makes me love it so much, but I do. I understand the whole obsessive co-dependency view of it and why people are completely put off by it, but for me, it was easy to get past it. Jamie McGuire has created a story that draws you in and make you WANT to know what's going to happen next. I literally couldn't put it down ANY of the times i've read it, and yes I mean MANY, because no matter how many times I read it, it was just as good, if not better.<br />It will make you want to read it over and over and over.....

B0034JKZ86|1.0|I thankfully happened to watch this on HBO when it was out before I let my 2 1/2 yr old to watch it. Seriously, this right up there with Pinocchio and the middle of Dumbo for awfulness for kids. Why Disney would EVER think it was ok to have demons, voodoo and essentially the devil all in the same movie is beyond me. That witch doctor was beyond creepy and if they wanted him to be the villain in the movie, they REALLY should have lightened up and not made him so scary, creepy and basically seeming as if he's coming from the depths of hell. And I am totally fine with characters like the \\"under god\\" in Hercules and all the other bad guys for the most part in Disney movies, but this went way too far. I think too many people are over looking some Disney movies as not being completely suitable for small children because it's made by Disney, so it MUST be fine. As a mom of 2, I won't be letting my kids watch this for MANY MANY years to come, if at all!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Whoa!  At first I was a bit surprised at the graphic nature of this book, but it really is simply just a classic love story.  Boy meets girl, boy gets girl, boy screws up and looses girl.  It's clear to me that Christian and Ana are passionately in love with each other and have a lot of work to do to get through their respective issues in order make their relationship work.  Looking forward to reading the second and third books in the trilogy.

B00003OSU4|5.0|This is not a music video, nor is it exactly a documentary of the 1958 Newport Jazz Festival. Instead, it is a mixture of Americana, people watching, music and Newport itself. In fact, a lot of the scenery - aside from the town of Newport - is of regattas. I felt as though I were wisked back to 1958 (I was 9 at the time of the festival). So, the good news is you go on a trip down memory lane. The bad news is the camera isn't always on the performers.<br /><br />Headliners: Jimmy Giuffre, Thelonious Monk, Henry Grimes, Sonny Stitt, Sal Salvador, Anita O'Day, George Shearing, Dinah Washington, Gerry Mulligan, Big Maybelle Chuck Berry, Chico Hamilton, Louis Armstrong, Jack Teagarden, Mahalia Jackson.<br /><br />Supporting musicians: David Baily, Bob Brookmeyer, Buck Clayton, Bill Crow, Eric Dolphy, Eli's Chosen Six (short segment), Art Farmer, Harold Gaylon, Nathan Gershman, Terry Gibbs, Urbie Green, Jim Hall, Peanuts Hucko, Jo Jones, Ray Mosca, Armando Peraza, Max Roach, Rudy Rutherford.<br /><br />The performances:<br />Train And The River (The Jimmy Guiffre Trio)<br /><br />Blue Monk (Thelonious Monk)<br /><br />Loose Walk (Sonny Stitt)<br /><br />Sweet Georgia Brown & Tea For Two (Anita O'Day) Sweet Georgia Brown was in a strange tempo, but when Tea for Two got underway a real highlight - aside from Anita's great singing and good looks - was when she traded phrases with the drummer. I don't recall any shots of the drummer, unfortunately, so that would have been a disappointment except the camera cut to some cuties in the audience. Of course, those cuties are now in their 70s and 80s or dead.<br /><br />All Of Me (Dinah Washington) This was the highlight for me. Dinah, at one point, picked up a pair of mallets and did a duet with the vibe player (with a smiling Max Roach looking on). Max was in great form and Dinah did a remarkable job on the vibes! Oh, and this rendition is probably her finest. If you've ever listened to a Dinah Washington compilation album with All of Me on it, this may be the cut you heard.<br /><br />Catch As Catch Can (Gerry Mulligan) Great 50s style jazz.<br /><br />I Ain't Mad At You (Big Maybelle) Blues epitomized!<br /><br />Sweet Little Sixteen (Chuck Berry)Until I watched this video this was my favorite clip. I discovered it on YouTube and it's the first post in Post Your Favorite YouTube Videos thread. Jo Jones on drums. Chuck doing his skip-walk across the stage while Jack Teagarten is looking on not knowing what to think, and the unidentified clarinet player getting into it.<br /><br />Blue Sands (Chico Hamilton Quintet) On the fence about this one. Chico is a great and innovative drummer who did some amazing mallet work (now I know why he used concert toms). The piece, though, was a cross between Carribean and New Age.

B0076D20E8|5.0|Its a happy coincidence that my 24 hr viewing period ended today,  so I HAD to watch it, On Shakespeare's Birthday (4/23/1564).  The movie is provocative, I thoroughly enjoyed it.  I suspect Shakespeare would have, too.  It's a sad tale. And fictional, I am sure.  Yet I can see how it could also be true.  (Although, my English History is not so scholarly.)    Also found in honor of Shakespeare's Birthday:    Tchaikovsky: Romeo & Juliet / Gergiev · London Symphony Orchestra  [...]
B001NLKT60|4.0|I immediately started \\"The Girl Who Played With Fire\\" after completing the first book.  As with the first book, this one took its time setting up the story for which I was grateful.  The first book ended with such drama, I needed to ease into the 2nd book.  Lots of names, investigators, investigations and background stories.<br /><br />If you can make it through the set up, it's well worth it.  This book is thought provoking, scary, concerning and a page-turner.  For anyone who likes intrigue, mystery and interesting characters, this is a must read!
B005JABU82|5.0|Perfect 144 Freedom Gundam. I love it. The model is as intregate as a perfect grade but has fun to build a master grade. This is a must buy for any Gundam Seed fan. Only minor painting of 1 part. To male it look completely like it does in the show. So painting is optional to the user. This is not for kids under 10 unless used to building models. Easy to understand pictures to put model together. No translation needed.
B004UXUX4Q|4.0|It is a pleasure to add this movie to my personal collection so I can relax and watch it again whenever the mood strikes.  It's a sweet story with a little humor, some emotion and  wonderful Hawaiian scenery.  The actors are perfect in their parts and the fact that they all enjoyed working together  shows in their performances.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Loved these books. I honestly didn't think they would interest me but once I started reading them, I couldn't stop.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|awesome photo editing app! I love playing around with it! a good free app adds are a like annoying but they don't. totally ruin your fun. Awesome app
006197806X|2.0|My review may be somewhat biased because I was incredibly disappointeted with Delirum and I was hoping Pandemonium would revive the series for me.  The entire plot was predictable but most plots are. Overall, the plot was fast paced and I enjoyed the mixture of the \\"Then\\" and \\"Now\\" chapters.  This broke up both storylines, otherwise I think the book may have been boring.  While I was reading this book though I kept feeling hints from other series and books, the idea of a \\"Homestead\\" that is in an underground labrynth, ring a bell?  This sounded just like Stephanie Meyer's \\"The Host\\".  The idea of a love triangle that appears in the end of the series screams Hunger Games.  The book was just okay, not one of my favorites but certainly not horrible.<br /><br />On a seperate more OCD point,<br />Rarely do I consider the idea to stop reading a book, but I came very close in the begining of Pandemonium.  (NOT A SPOILER) It bothers me when there are typos.  It bothers me even more when there are plot holes. Lena clearly thinks \\"Of course they wouldn't care about silverware or things like that in the Wilds\\" (28) but then a few pages later \\"although I can barely hold my fork because of the blisters\\" (73).  Little things like this are not that essential to a plot but it bothers me when the author, the editors, and anyone else who read the book before it was published did not pick up on the mistake.  It shows how rushed the publication was.  Later in the book (SPOILER) it happens again, \\"We take turns carrying her - me, Raven, Hunter, Lu, and Grandpa\\" (221).  I distinctly remember that Hunter had not returned to the main group but I kept reading assuming I had missed something but later my orginal thoughts were confirmed, \\"Since Tack and Hunter never made it home\\" (254).  Some people may consider this to be over obsession but I rather recieve a sequal months later rather than an incomplete unrevised edition.
B002F6FQGK|5.0|this album is amazing and rabbit heart is my personal favorite. florence and the machine have the style that keeps you going :-)

B004JN1D2I|2.0|I don't make comments on books I read but I have to make an exception in this case.<br />The very first thing I did after finishing Book 4 is to delete the books from my Kindle library since I don't want my kids to know that I read them and to make sure that they won't stumble into them  when they run out of other books to read.<br />I like fantasy books in general since they can be filled with imaginary creatures, races, magic, noble pursuits, powerful artifacts, and fantastical sceneries. The authors are not constrained within the human bounds and therefore do not have to rely on cheap tricks to pad the stories, like sex and violence, and tons of human characters with little to differentiate between them.<br />This book series is almost all about sex and violence and tons of look-alike characters. The septas (nuns) are described as a bunch of \\"wrinkled c*nts, half of they pray for a good raping\\". It's not just a vulgar statement from an obnoxious character but it pretty much sets the tone for the whole series. Female characters can't wait until they reach puberty so they can claim to be grown women and have sex. Much old men also wait for exactly that as well. Violence is not just about blood and gore but glorifies tortures as well.<br />The vast majority of the characters in the books are obnoxious characters and if I read on at all, it's simply to see if they will get into a quick and violent end so justice will prevail. Unfortunately, the series just drags on and on and there is no quick end. The good characters either die very quickly out of sheer stupidity or become so inept and hopeless that it's frustrating to read about them. The whole Book Four is about characters I couldn't care less about and each irrelevant character drags in a family tree of even more irrelevant characters until you can't keep track of (or even care about) who is who. There's an appendix at the end of each book which lists all the names from all the family trees but, seriously !!<br />This books series is more like a TV series. intended to draw enough interest through violence and sex, bordering on child porn, to continue as long as possible. I suspect if I add up all the descriptions of the human body parts normally covered by underwears, they would be longer than the plots on the one or two characters I remain interested in by the end of book three (and book four does not cover those characters at all). It's that bad.
B0055SWM08|5.0|The use of the word &quot;zen &quot; in the description put me off but my brother said to try it.  Glad I did.
B00634GHJA|5.0|Very pleased with this app - installed cleanly, clear and easy controls and the network transfers work very well.  It is saving me a lot of effort over the wired transfer of pictures.
0393327345|4.0|The movie is my all time favorite, so I had VERY high expectations from the book.<br />It almost, just almost, met them all.<br />I won't ruin it for you, but I believe it's a matter of imprinting. If I'd read the book first, I'd be a little dissapointed by the movie. Since I saw the movie first, and loved it so much, the book could never have won. It was a lost battle. I bet Tyler would have loved it that way :)
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was recommended to me by a friend, and she was right about it holding your attention. Suzanne Collins crafts this story so you can't wait to see what comes next. Once you finish this first book, you are hooked for the rest of the series - all of which are very good. This book is not just for teens, and while they are the target audience, it makes this book easy to read but no less entertaining.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I know it's marked as a fantasy novel, but it really has so much more to it than that.<br />Actually, the fantasy part is almost negligible. It exists, but it doesn't play a part in the plot.<br />The book takes place in a different world from ours. The seasons are different and lasts for years. The winter is harsh, and during the long winters many perish.<br />The kingdom of westeros that was once divided into seven seperate kingdoms is united for a thousand years under the Targarian dynasty of kings, until the noble houses rebel against the mad king to start a new dynasty.<br />The first novel revolves mostly around one of these nobles, Eddard (Ned) Stark. His friend, king Robert, who he once helped winning the Iron Throne, needs his help. Ned leaves the eternal winter of the north, and join his king in the capitol of Westeros.<br />Politics, sex, schemes inside schemes, more politics, more sex, great battles, and the best set of characters I've read in years.<br />I finished the first book, and went on to the next that same day (more than 2,000 pages).<br />Great read.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|love this game. takes me back to when I was a kid. cant get enough of it. only down side is you have enough energy at times cause its wastes so fast.
B005PKOOT8|5.0|Great singer and great musical arrangements with a touch of Andaluz flavor. I really enjoy this CD at night after a busy day at work or for a special evening with your sencond half. Soft Spanish pop and a few dancing songs.
B005HSL626|5.0|I love fruit ninja and it is the best on an ipad or android tablet bacause its huge. I got a kindle fire and its one of the few things on my favorites list along with angrybird space and Jeff dunham shows. I highly recommend it for anybody and if you cant afford to pay get the free version of this spectacular gameor if you want more features beg the .99 cent version with a lot more features.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I bought these, as I needed a pair of closed over ear headphones. I have a pair of Grado SR125's that sound great, but everyone else hears them, too.  I purchased these because I have used this model of headphone many times in studio and live mixing environments, and have always been pleased with the sound reproduction. I would not argue that these have a perfectly flat response curve from 20hz-20khz, but they are decently so.  The high's tend to roll off a little bit, but not too much, and the bass can definitely have some added punch. I find them very pleasant to listen to.  Like most over the ear headphones, these can get tiring to wear, as they have a fairly tight clamping force.  I am use to that though, and these are a little less fatiguing than my Grado pair.<br /><br />I've never had quality issues with the pairs I've used in the past, and I am hoping that is true with these.
B003UCPE38|5.0|Great album on 180g vinyl. If you haven't heard this album yet, you really should do yourself a favor and give it a listen. Even if you don't like it, it should be in your collection.
B003TJ4YUQ|5.0|As a continuation of Songs around the World,this disc lived up to the scope of the outreach to all<br />musicians who played. The music was greatand the video cover was also well done.<br />When one sees the country of another,music crosses all language barriers and makes one heart speak to the other. I can't wait for the next issue because as I listen, I pray for those music players that thru the melodies they play,we can become one in the spirit.
0345803485|5.0|I think this series is a really good  I read all 3 book in a short period of time. I love to read . It kept me in awe like what is going to happen next. I laughed and thought omg ! & I cried at least once in each book. I did find that some of the intimate scenes did get a little  repetitive tho. But it is about  a wealthy man  who has had a seriously messed up childhood and he reflects his pain by trying to control situations of his life now. All situations. But in the end he winds up getting more than he bargained for.
B003EYVXV4|5.0|The Movie was very Great, some parts were different from the book but most was the same. The shaky-cam didnt ruin the movie at all so dont listen to the people that said it was a one star the shaky-cam was GREAT!!!!!! Over all the movie was Amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B002BWP49C|4.0|I liked this movie and even though it was the closet one to the book yet I think it dragged. I am a twilight fan  I just I was expected something different. I have all the books & movies so far and I am hoping. Part 2 is better

Good purchase.  4 stars.
0143121006|5.0|Pamela Werner was a high-spirited, independent young woman living with her father in Peking, China during the late 1930s.<br />On a cold January night in 1937, Pamela was found brutally murdered at the foot of one of Peking's well-known landmarks - the Fox Tower.<br /><br />Pre-world war II Peking was a stressful place to live.  China was in the midst of a civil war and the Japanese had invaded and were waiting for the opportunity to capture the city.<br /><br />Nerves were frayed.  A cloud of doom hung over the streets.  Even the well-protected foreign nationals were feeling the shifting of events. But the brutal murder of Pamela Werner kicked the anxieties of the city up several notches.  Both the Chinese and foreign nationals fearfully wondered who could have butchered this innocent young girl.<br /><br />Paul French's Midnight In Peking is a masterfully woven non-fiction murder mystery peopled with smug British diplomats, harried Scotland Yard detectives, Chinese police officers with mysterious agendas, an American dentist with degraded, lustful designs, and a beautiful young woman who isn't all that she seems.<br /><br />French has done his research, and his findings from the papers of Pamela's father are most intriguing.  Even after the British dropped the case, Werner doggedly pursued his daughter's murderer asking help from the Chinese and even the occupying Japanese.  His determination to find his daughter's killer is inspiring.<br />Midnight In Peking reads like a true-to-life Agatha Christie with a lot more carnality.  Peking, like most places, had a dark side that could lure a naïve young woman to her death, and French takes us there.<br /><br />This is no stuffy history text.  It's a blood and guts whodunit that twists and turns through the not so savory back alleys of the present capital of China and digs up dirt on some of her upstanding citizens and those not so upstanding.<br /><br />French delivers history you can smell, taste, and feel.  Midnight in Peking transports you to an extremely turbulent time in China's history and puts you in the middle of the events that transpired that frigid night.<br /><br />History and mystery.  As a fan of both genres, Midnight in Peking is a win-win.<br /><br />Courtesy copy of Midnight in Peking from Penguin Books through Net Galley<br />.in Peking transports you to an extremely turbulent time in China's history and puts you in the middle of the events that transpired that frigid night.<br /><br />History and mystery.

B004PIKPTY|5.0|Pros: Exceptional build quality over my previous headset (Gamecom 777, which snapped in two). The materials are of higher quality than others I've used. The DTS audio is great when watching your favorite blurays and you can definitely hear your enemies sneaking up on you when gaming. Be sure to use the included software to tweak the sound to your liking, as well as setting the DTS to \\"movie\\" mode before starting your movies. I leave it set on \\"music\\" for everything else. The braided cable is a nice feature with the attached velcro strap, so you don't have to wind the cable around your headphones when transporting. The nice bonuses would include the light-up Tt logo on the ear cups (which can be switched off) and the inline controller which is easy to use but also has a sliding \\"Lock\\" on the side to keep from accidently triggering a button (mute) mid-game. Though it didn't matter to me, some may enjoy the extra long 3 meter USB cable on this headset. It will have no trouble reaching the rear input on your case and will still leave you with slack to move around a bit. This headset also includes interchangeable ear pads; one set is leather which are good for isolation, one set is cloth which you may find to be more comfortable.<br /><br />Cons: None<br /><br />Overall, I am extremely pleased with Thermaltake and will likely purchase other Tt eSports products based on the how much I love these headphones. A vast upgrade from my previous headset from a different brand.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is fun and addictive. I love it and would highly recommend it. I play it almost everyday. Enjoy!
B005K17RU0|5.0|I've really enjoyed this product, it has more in-depth information and hour by hour temps. Much better that the weather app that came with the Verizon phone. The only issue, and this may not be the app but the phone, is sometimes it has the wrong town and shows one nearby instead.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love this game. you can pass the time by so fast with this game. Its better this way cause you don't have to deal the cards.
B0063IH60K|3.0|just ok. would be better without the commercials. don.'t know if it is the kindle or the solitaire program that is freezing up.
B007SSEBCU|1.0|streep shines, but as a movie this is labour propaganda and a shameless abuse of one of freedom's greatest heroes.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I couldn't put the books down. It took me all of one day to read the first book and the second and third books were read by week's end. I fell in love with the characters and was fascinated by the story line. Some things were a bit redundant and tedious, which is why I rated this four stars. Otherwise it would have gotten five stars all the way. I'm not into BDSM but if it's as described in these books I want to be. ;) I'm a sucker for a fairy tale, even one with a dark twist. I want to find my Christan Grey. I'm forever ruined for all man-kind. Thanks E.L. James!
0545265355|5.0|The books were great. Like \\"Harry Potter\\" and \\"Twilight\\" I could not stop reading. I have not seen the movie yet, but am looking forward to it.

1851687793|4.0|Since the day I rescued copies of the original \\"Mr Tomkins\\" books from a school library \\"discard\\" pile, I've always been an enthusiastic reader of books which try to explain advanced science and technology concepts in a fun way, and this book (and it's newer counterpart about relativity) caught my eye recently.<br /><br />The concept is simple: Chad Orzel's dog, Emmy, may be a typical mutt obsessed with walks, squirrels and discarded food, but she's also intelligent enough to have a basic grasp of quantum concepts, and a view to how they might be exploited in her favour, for example by passing simultaneously around both sides of a tree to catch a squirrel. Each chapter starts with Chad explaining why \\"it's not quite like that\\", and going on to explain the real physics to her in some detail. This works well, breaking up some quite complex discussions with amusing dialogue between master and hound, and makes the book eminently readable.<br /><br />The books scores because it's bang up to date, and goes beyond the basic quantum concepts into more complex areas like decoherence, entanglement and quantum teleportation, supplementing explanations of the basic concepts and \\"thought experiments\\" with the details and outcomes of relatively recent experimental verification. Similarly \\"quantum\\" is the current buzzword beloved of pseudo-scientific charlatans, and the last chapter is a timely effort to debunk those who abuse it for get-rich-quick schemes and medical quackery.<br /><br />I also particularly liked the way that the author is not afraid to embrace the concepts of measurement errors and accuracy. These are vital tools to understand how well, or badly, something has been established, and I was very pleased to see such an accessible book using them well.<br /><br />The explanations themselves are a mixed bunch, some being very complicated and taking me a couple of goes to read and absorb. Given that I probably have rather more background that the target demographic (Ido have a good Physics degree, albeit a few years old) this may mean that some readers could struggle with the most complex parts. I suspect a few more diagrams in these areas might have helped. However overall the book succeeds, and will probably prompt keen readers to re-read or seek out secondary explanations where they don't understand first time.<br /><br />In the Kindle edition some of the graphics are a page or two adrift of the relevant text, and the footnotes (which often contain important or amusing asides) are presented in a bunch at the end of each chapter, which is not very reader friendly. I suspect the paper version of the book is better in this respect.<br /><br />This books is well worth reading, and has certainly helped to refresh and update my understanding of a complex field, while giving me a welcome laugh at the dog's antics. I look forward to reading the relativity volume later this year.
0439023521|4.0|The hunger games, the first book in the series, is a great and addicting read. From the very first page I was enthralled with the style of writing and how interesting district 12 was. The book itself is around 300 pages, but it is a very fast read because it is just so addicting and is what I like to call a page turner, you'll find yourself wanting to read chapter after chapter because you want to know what happens to the main character(s). The story is told from the narrative of Katniss, the main character, and we get to see the world of Panam and District 12 through her eyes. This a book I would highly recommend, it's a cross between 1984 and running man. Very fun, but brutal, and you will care about the characters by the end of the book.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great! Does what it should do, it's free, &amp; it doesn't constantly bombard you with ads, just a quick screen after each game.

B007WPLZAK|5.0|This WWI movie, with lush flashbacks to pre-war France, is alternately beautiful and horrifying.  The trenches in the France in 1916 are ghastly.  Intermingled are haunting and evocative images of a romance from before the war.  Acting is excellent.  Beautifully crafted movie.
B005LAIIRQ|1.0|I have less trouble suspending disbelief for things like Star Wars, Underworld, even the tv show \\"Grimm\\" than I did watching this.<br /><br />It was hard for someone who spends time outdoors, in the cold , to believe that those guys made it more than 10 minutes walking across the wilderness in a blowing snowstorm, in deep snow, in sub-zero temperatures.  If you've ever WALKED across snow like that, you know how hard it is even if you HAVE snowshoes, much less in work boots.  It's commonly known , if you've been outdoors in the cold, that exposed skin will get frostbite pretty quick in those kinds of conditions.  And they might have walked a 100 yards or more, and said \\"to heck with this nonsense.  I'd rather die\\".<br /><br />And wolves... just to be sure, I checked with other people I know who know something about wolves.  This kind of hunting down and killing humans?  Well, it might have happened a couple of hundred years ago, in Europe, where people didn't venture into the woods.  But today?  That was just ridiculous.<br /><br />They don't do that.<br /><br />Liam Neeson should be ashamed.  I'm a fan of his... have seen very few movies that he didn't knock it out of the park.<br />This is like \\"Jaws in the Arctic, on land\\".<br /><br />Perpetuating myths.<br /><br />I saw this in the theater.  Very disappointed.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I bought this eight days ago based on Amazon recommendations, its price and the reviews. I finished it today, and cannot recommend it highly enough.<br />It's a great piece of Post-apocalyptic science fiction, with believable characters, set in such a way that it could be 5 or 5000 years in the future. I just bought book 6 of the Wool saga, and anticipate the next volume.

0345803485|4.0|My hats off to Ms. James-she has an incredibly vivid imagination, but if the manuscript for \\"50 Shades of Grey\\" ever saw an editor's desk, they should be fired! I almost wanted to get out my blue editing pencil from college journalism classes and go to it. The writing is horrendous, the characters are cliches, and the plotline is beyond far-fetched. But let's face it- \\"50 Shades\\" is not meant to be a \\"literary classic,\\" but it is becoming a cultural icon. If you can get past the writing, and are looking for \\"escapist romantic fiction,\\" this is a book for you. At its heart, \\"50 Shades of Grey\\" is a love story-it reminded me of both \\"An Officer and a Gentleman,\\" and \\"Pretty Woman\\"-because both of these movies featured a tormented, but \\"longing to be loved\\" protagonist, much like Christian Grey. I think the allure of Christian lies in the fact that he is flawed, and because his character takes along time to develop-you know there is more to him than kinky sex pervert-the reader can make Christian into whatever you imagine him to be. It is the mystery surrounding what drives Christian to behave as he does that kept me reading. I think \\"50 Shades\\" is a book that readers will feel passionate about-both literally and figuratively-and there is no \\"black and white\\" here-but many more shades of grey than the naked eye can see.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|this book continues from the first and offers a heart gripping story.<br />the authors ability to pull you out of the past and in to the present of the characters offers a great perspective on how to much knowledge can hinder learning, which seems to be the over all theme of the book.

B006R1T40I|5.0|Bonnie Raitt's voice is timeless; clear tones and a sweet, soulful quality that defies age.  This album gives comfort for the soul and puts a spring in your step.  This is the work of a great artist.
B004S5C91Q|5.0|I found this book both confronting and engrossing. The author maintained my interest by cleverly unfolding the story in all its heartwrenching detail and answering my questions as to what was really happening in the room in small stages. She portrayed the five year old boy, Jack, with amazing authenticity and creativity. The issues involved in the story were dealt with sympathetically and in sufficient detail, without any tedium. The story was heartbreaking, but finished on an optimistic note and left me wanting to read more.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|I finally got a tablet, Kindle Fire, and this simple cover is exactly what I need to protect my investment.

Overall - good design and good delivery!

B007BVOF8E|1.0|This movie was so incredibly boring. My question to the director is, how many shades of brown did u use, in every scene!?!? Visually boring! Soundtrack wasn't boring... Because there was none! Flashbacks were the worst, there was no differance in the characters, the lighting, or sounds to let u know u were in a flashback. very hard to follow coupled with extremely boring equals me asleep and wishing I had spent the money on...

0345803485|1.0|This book was a poor attempt to capture the underbelly of the S&M world. Was I supposed to believe a virgin would have gone from never being kiss to executing a contract outling what acts she deems acceptable by her dominate.  Will men reading this book think all single women will want to be placed in special rooms, whipped, spanked and degraded?

Great for walking and hiking....in or out of water. I can wear them all day and my feet stay happy. I prefer the men's size 8 to the women's 9.5 for the wider and deeper toe box. A great sandal that lasts, making it worth the money.

0062183591|5.0|Dan Ariely made his name as an author demonstrating that rationality is not necessarily determinative of our thoughts or actions.<br /><br />'The Honest Truth About Dishonesty' digs in new directions in the same vein: \\"The primary purpose of this book is to examine the rational cost-benefit forces that are presumed to drive dishonest behavior but (as you will see) often do not, and the irrational forces that we think don't matter but often do.\\"<br /><br />Applying behavioral economics theory, Ariely suggests that \\"we can restructure our environment, and that by doing so we can achieve better behaviors and outcomes.\\"<br /><br />Ariely suggests that people generally wish to be honest, but are tempted to compromise their ideals. Not surprisingly, he looks to religious rituals as exemplary of instilling ideals and keeping them present in people's minds. Overall, the book is much heavier on citing deception and self-deception, than in exploring remedies. If I had one wish as a reader, it would be for Ariely to include additional, systematic discussion and analysis of how society, organizations and individuals can promote ethical thought and action to counter the challenges and temptations he presents so well.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

The entire cast, at least the regulars, are all very attractive.<br /> I will admit, however, that early parts of each have ooky bits, the early discovery of whatever Human remains are being examined.

B006LPI0N2|5.0|Kathleen Ferrier's recording career with EMI was relatively brief in an already too brief career. Although he was delighted at having signed her up, Walter Legge's dictatorial manner repelled her and she soon defected to Decca, for whom, by and large, she made the best of her recordings in terms of both quality and sound.<br /><br />Nonetheless, there are gems here: not least her early microphone testing sessions for Legge, the invaluable \\"Kindertotenlieder\\" for her mentor Bruno Walter and a complete recording of her signature role, Gluck's \\"Orfeo\\", in Amsterdam in 1951. The latter is an egregious example of where an EMI version easily tops the Decca: the 1947 recording, made under the inflexible Stiedry before Ferrier had refined and deepened her interpretation on stage, is both abridged and inferior in almost every way to this one. Conversely, the Bach excerpts, recorded almost by accident during rehearsals with Elisabeth Schwarzkopf under Karajan, are nowhere near as satisfying as the studio recordings made for Decca with Sir Adrian Boult, so ardent collectors will want to own the complete sets from both houses.<br /><br />There is a theory that part of Ferrier's extraordinary quality of sound derives from the fact that she was in a sense a true original, never having been schooled to acquire a \\"conservatory sound\\", although to my ears she is simply the natural successor in a line of traditional British contraltos now virtually extinct. The nearest we have heard post-war is another great British singer, Janet Baker, who would surely admit to possessing a somewhat lighter voice with a timbre and colouring more mezzo-soprano than true contralto - although there is considerable overlap in the Fach, bearing in mind that Verdi expected his contraltos to have a top B, as indeed did the stentorian British contralto Dame Clara Butt. Both Baker and Ferrier excelled as Gluck's Orfeo and in Brahms's \\"Vier ernste Ges&auml;nge\\" but whereas Baker had more of an upper extension and was never going to attempt Fricka or Waltraute, it is possible to speculate that Ferrier could have gone on to sing some of the great Wagner roles had she lived beyond the age of 41.<br /><br />Certainly the richness of her oboe sound, with its amplitude and unobtrusive, flickering vibrato, inspired an affection and emotional response in listeners which endure to this day, despite the fact Ferrier had a professional career spanning little more than a decade.<br /><br />The earliest items here are those tests made by Legge in 1944 which remained unissued until 1978, comprising of pieces by Gluck, Brahms and Elgar. Although beautifully sung, the English translation of \\"Che far&ograve;\\" has, understandably, given the time when and the conditions under which it was made, a rather placid, oratorio-like quality; the aria is utterly transformed by the time we come to the complete, live performance in 1951. Particularly valuable is the aria from \\"The Dream of Gerontius\\", sung grandly to only piano accompaniment, as of course she never recorded a role which was surely ideal suited to her sonorous, plangent alto.<br /><br />She signed a one year contract with Legge and her first commercial releases were the two stately arias by Maurice Green, two sterling Handel solos and five delightful duets from Purcell and Mendelssohn with Isobel Baillie. She then left for Decca, returning to EMI to record \\"Kindertotenlieder\\" with Walter in 1949. The bonus tracks here are previously unreleased back-up takes. Interestingly, the notes tell us that the recording \\"was originally recorded on 12-inch waxes, with a tape machine running as safety back-up, as was EMI s practice in 1949. Masters from the waxes were used for most of the original 78-rpm sides, but for the release of the work on CD, the back-up tapes were used, and these reserve takes have also survived.\\"<br /><br />Moving on to 1951, Ferrier's Orfeo is a tour de force: the sinews of her Italian have by this stage of her career hardened and she is able to fine down her ample tone to enhance the pathos of her appeal to the Furies. The first cries of \\"Euridice\\" send the message that here is a voice of depth and tenderness. Her soft singing, command of portamento and affecting messa di voce all add greatly to the drama of Euridice's second death and the subsequent celebrated lament. Sadly, no other singer on stage - neither the two other soloists, nor the enthusiastic and expressive chorus afflicted with the curse of the wobbly soprano - is remotely in her league. The Amore is nasal and tweety but adequate; Euridice is gusty and tremulous. The opening of the Elysian Fields scene is especially unpromising, with ill-tuned strings, the chorus slipping out of synch with the orchestra and Euridice twittering unsteadily - but things soon look up with a lovely, rapt, absolutely steady \\"Che puro ciel!\\" from Ferrier and Bruck skilfully bringing out the delicate orchestration to heighten the serene mood. As further compensation, the sound derived from the painstakingly restored original tapes is very acceptable; the voices are very present, there are very few coughs and even though the orchestral sound is muddy, it is clear that Bruck conducts sensitively. He is always alive to Gluck's colouring and paces proceedings aptly, unlike Stiedry's undue haste. In particular, he gets the tempo just right for \\"Che far&ograve;\\".<br /><br />The version sung is a kind of back-formation of Berlioz's orchestration sung in Italian, standard before an amalgam of the Vienna and Paris editions became the norm, so a modern listener will find it somewhat truncated.<br /><br />The other major item here is of course the Mahler song cycle with Walter. Many collectors will already be familiar with their famous \\"Das Lied von der Erde\\"; the conductor was a huge admirer of the singer and that respect was reciprocated. Again we notice how Ferrier's linguistic command has matured under Walter's tutelage and the interpretations themselves are mesmerising; her dark voice and Walter's authentic Mahlerian sensibility make a perfect marriage. The playing of the VPO is wonderfully warm and impassioned. This remains a classic account and every lover of these elegies should know it. The two previously unreleased bonus tracks reveal the consistency of Ferrier's instrument; perhaps one or two slight rhythmic slips and a desire to fill out her tone more fully at one or two climaxes and apply more emotional weight in places such as the opening of \\"In diesem Wetter\\" prompted the desire to re-take but any imperfections are hardly perceptible.<br /><br />No texts are supplied but there is an informative essay by Warwick Thompson and three rare publicity photographs from the EMI vaults, taken when Ferrier first signed a contract with HMV/Columbia.d she is able to fine down her ample tone to enhance the pathos of her appeal to the Furies.

B00127RAJY|4.0|I have really enjoyed doing this DVD. I have two children, so having a ton of time to spend at the gym is impossible for me. This 20 minute workout makes me feel like I've really done something for my body without having to spend hours at the gym not knowing if what I'm doing is going to produce results. After less than a week I was already feeling stronger.<br /><br />Unfortunately, after doing the dvd for 10 days, I have to rest now because my knees are hating life. Every cardio exercise in the video is high impact, and every combo/strength exercise includes squats/lunges.  This is a total bummer for me because this is the first video in a really long time that I have not gotten tired of. I honestly think this is an awesome workout, but at 37 years old my knees need a break. I have stairs in my house and it's a little painful to even go up them right now. I'm going to research some low impact cardio that I can do instead of some of the high impact exercises and hopefully I can get back into it.

1400069289|4.0|Ever wonder why you do things without thinking about them?  This book explains how the \\"automatic\\" part of our brain works.  It helps you identify cues that trigger subsequent actions that result in various forms of gratification.  When you can identify these cues you can alter the habit (not break it) with positive results. It helped me identify and alter some hardwired cues that made dieting difficult. You can identify what cues make you buy certain products, eat at certain fast food outlets, take certain actions, etc.  The Power of Habit allows you to take an interesting look into yourself.  Well worth the read and learn.

B003XF1XOQ|1.0|Really disappointed 3rd book.  I'm glad I did not spend any money on it and borrowed it on amazon prime.<br /><br />Compared to the first 2 it is really stupid and other reviewers have mentioned why.  What a pathetic way to end a trilogy.
B007MNV5WU|3.0|there weren't enough levels. I finished it in one day.I don't recommend buying it. I first liked it but now I don't.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Like everyone else, I loved the first two books!  I liked this one as well, although I do feel dissatisfied about the pieces of this book that are \\"missing\\". I read the entire series in 4 days, so it must have been pretty gripping.  However, I am truly surprised that this series is considered young adult fiction.  The overall theme of this last book is very dark and parts were more disturbing than any of the adult horror fiction I've read.  I would definitely recommend that parents read this book first before handing it over to your 12 year old.<br /><br />*Now for the part with Spoilers*<br /><br />I'm open minded when reading and have no argument with who Katniss ended up with or how drastically much the characters changed in the course of this last book (like I have any say, ha).  I wasn't looking for a fairy tale and given the circumstances, I think the book ended in the best way it could, but I really do feel a little cheated out of some of the story about how they got there though.  How did Peeta suddenly get over most of his issues enough to be with her in the end...I don't doubt that he could, but after being with them through this whole journey, I would have liked to experience more of what finally brought them back together.  As some of the other reviews have said, she really did spend a lot of the time hiding in closets and drugged and if there is time for describing her hiding places in detail, I would have preferred for a little more time to be spent explaining what happened after Katniss shot the president.  I understand why she did it, I understand why she 'agreed' to the games, I even understand how her and Gale could have grown apart and that he was passionate about his hatred of the Capitol from the beginning, but I would have been more satisfied with this book as a whole if I had been able to read a little more about the culmination and ending of this war that she lost herself fighting, instead of just getting a blurb about it when she was in thehovercraft at the end.  I thought the Hunger Games book was much better than the movie, but I find myself hoping that the final movie might help wrap things up a little more fully.
B005ETANC2|3.0|I have been a fan of Universal Studios 1955 sci-fi classic \\"Tarantula\\" since I first saw it as a kid on a Louisville-based weekly Creature Feature show called \\"Memories of Monsters\\" back in the mid-1980's. I recorded it on VHS and watched it countless times throughout the rest of the 1980's until the tape was eventually lost during a move. I didn't rediscover the film until recently when I watched it on Turner Classic Movies. I was surprised to find out that I liked the movie as much now as I did then.<br /><br />Much like many of the \\"giant bug\\" films of the 1950's, \\"Tarantula\\" uses nuclear testing, and/or bio-engineering-gone-wrong as a plot device. It is the best of the giant bug films of its era in my opinion and stands the test of time, unlike alot of its constituants.<br /><br />The DVD, however, is awful. The transfer is terrible and the sound is abysmal. I am hoping that at some point Universal gives this film the type of DVD release it deserves. This particular DVD release will have to do for the time being.

B007B6VOG0|4.0|I'm going to start out by saying that I've been a fan of Nate's musical endeavors since I first heard the Format's \\"Dog Problems\\" and still love almost everything he does. I try to evaluate the record on its own, but I will compare it to his previous work in a few places. I admit comparisons aren't everything, and a piece of art should be evaluated by itself, but I feel it must be done here.<br />Track-by-Track breakdown:<br /><br />1. Some Nights (Intro)<br />This is my favorite song on the record. I heard the slow piano intro and was prepared for another quirky, great, fun. record. Nate's singing is superb on this and it serves as a great intro to the record.<br /><br />2. Some Nights<br />The title track is another great song, although very different to some of his previous work. Very poppy and synthy, which is a a theme throughout the whole record.<br /><br />3. We Are Young<br />The lead single from the record. I actually quite like this song, but its over-saturation in my life has caused it to grow stale for me. But I still like it, and in a few months when it's \\"Old\\" to the masses, I will like it again. (I guess that sounds snobbish, but I've heard it too much and need a break.)<br /><br />4. Carry On<br />This is a song that I feel would not be too out of place on a Format record. Its slow acoustic beginning launching into a inspirational chorus that then gains volume with Simon and Garfunkel-esque percussion, albeit electronic. Strip it of its synths, and It wouldn't be out of place on Dog Problems.<br /><br />5. It Gets Better<br />Crap. Just Crap. Lyrically, it's lazy. Musically, it's annoying. The worst song on the record and I almost wanted to stop listening here. But I kept going and I'm glad I did.<br /><br />6. Why am I the One<br />Just like \\"Carry On,\\" I could see this easily residing on a Format record. Albeit with better percussion, but it's still a cool tune. A little lazy on the lyrics-I hate hearing words like \\"stuff\\" in songs. Nate, it was fine for the first repeat in the chorus, but how about a change for the second repetition? Still pretty good.<br /><br />7. All Alone<br />So Silly, but infectious, like most good pop tunes. Its synthesized quality and cool beat all point to this being a single. As long as it isn't ruined like \\"We Are Young\\" by overexposure, I wouldn't mind it being a hit.<br /><br />8. All Alright<br />Not bad. It just seems that lyrically the band was a little lazy here. Not really anything that appeals to me as a standout track here, but every album has at least one. \\"Dog Problems\\" even did. (For me it was \\"Pick Me Up,\\" but that's a different review.)<br /><br />9. One Foot<br />Kicking off with a awesome horn line, I was expecting a great tune. And I got one. Although Nate does explicitly defy the Catholic/Christian faith in the second verse, which make me a little shaky on this tune just for that. I'm not sure how I feel about it, but other than that, it's musically a great, catchy tune. I see it as it's his views and he's allowed to express it. It's still an awesome song. The modulation into a minor-ish key at the end is a nice touch.<br /><br />10. Stars.<br />One hyphenated word: Auto-Tune. Honestly, it's a freaking great song without the auto-tune. The song was so much better before Nate added it to his voice. I admit, this is one of the few times it is on this record, but it was applied to heavily here. Nate's voice is beautiful and this song is too. Without the auto-tune.<br /><br />This record is much different from Nate's previous work. If you liked him for his quirkiness and can't stand poppy, synthy stuff (like Neon Trees), you're not gonna like this record. If you liked the quirkyness but don't mind poppy stuff, this album is a good buy. As long as you don't mind the dud in the middle of the record, and can look past the caked-on auto-tune of \\"Stars,\\" I'd say give it a listen.ne for the first repeat in the chorus, but how about a change for the second repetition? Still pretty good.<br /><br />7. All Alone<br />So Silly, but infectious, like most good pop tunes. Its synthesized quality and cool beat all point to this being a single. As long as it isn't ruined like \\"We Are Young\\" by overexposure, I wouldn't mind it being a hit.<br /><br />8. All Alright<br />Not bad. It just seems that lyrically the band was a little lazy here. Not really anything that appeals to me as a standout track here, but every album has at least one. \\"Dog Problems\\" even did. (For me it was \\"Pick Me Up,\\" but that's a different review.)<br /><br />9. One Foot<br />Kicking off with a awesome horn line, I was expecting a great tune. And I got one. Although Nate does explicitly defy the Catholic/Christian faith in the second verse, which make me a little shaky on this tune just for that. I'm not sure how I feel about it, but other than that, it's musically a great, catchy tune. I see it as it's his views and he's allowed to express it. It's still an awesome song. The modulation into a minor-ish key at the end is a nice touch.<br /><br />10. Stars.<br />One hyphenated word: Auto-Tune. Honestly, it's a freaking great song without the auto-tune.

B004JZBGWI|4.0|This helps me remember what I'm supposed to be doing and when. It's not a hard app to use. It's easy to set and it will go off (make a noise) on a Kindle to let you know that a note you made for the future has appeared. Help me keep track of where I was too.
B005KJJ4F8|5.0|Great book. I could not set it down while reading it. I will definately be buying the next books in the series.
B00632HWOG|4.0|Well, you've got to check your yahoo email and the way to do it on your Kindle Fire is to get the yahoo email app. It works excellent and is much like the full computer version, easy to work with.
0307959856|2.0|I don't usually care for fan fiction, however, I hoped P.D. James might be able to pull it off. \\"Death Comes to Pemberly\\" was not up to her usual writing, and it was certainly not worthy of being linked to Miss Austen. The plot was scattered, the characters shallow, and it was too contrived to be enjoyable. Her references to \\"Persuasion\\" and \\"Emma\\" were forced and unnatural. I felt like the author was simply trying to cash in on someone else's work.
B004GYY714|2.0|I could not seem to get the same station twice in a row with this app but I have to admit that it offered a lot of genres to choose from.
0345803485|4.0|I have to say that the only reason I read this book, was because of all the hype. That's great for the author, because her writing style leaves much to be desired. However, you can overlook that, for the overall comsuming story. I felt I kept trying to dig deeper and deeper into the minds of the two main characters, especially Christian Grey, because it's told totally from Ana's point of view. She does seem to have the mind of a naive 21 year old, up against this truly disturbed man. The need for each other keeps growing throughout the book, but the impending disaster is clearly evident. It leaves you wanting more, but you can also walk away at the end of this book. As for me, I'm on to the next installment, hoping to learn more about what makes Mr.Grey tick.
0802473156|5.0|This book really has helped us. It is an easy read and kept my attention. By the time I finished it I had a new understanding of how love works.  My love Language is personal touch and I had not a clue as this is why I was so angry all the time at my husband. I was not getting my love tank filled with touching.  Then I found out my husbands love language and how I have really neglected that aspect of his needs without even knowing it.  We both have read the book and within a week we went from extreme dislike for each other to actual real smiles and happiness again.  Life is good!  I have recommended this to a few friends already.  It is a real eye opener.
B004SIIBGU|2.0|I'm not fond of the eBay app for the Kindle Fire.  The app takes forever to load.  It's easier to log onto my computer and browse eBay than to wait for my Kindle to load.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this film.  I know Christian movies get a bad rap for being corny, but this movie was not that at all. Moreover, it made Christian more human. I have to admit, there were one or two corny scenes but overall a really good movie. There were one too many plots but it was not out of control. I hope they make a Courageous film for women! lol.
B000I5XOW8|5.0|This movie is just amazing. Harrison Ford is unbelievable , and Tommy Lee Jones is a great supporting actor. Plot is great and thrilling and amazing movie of the 90's!!!
B006RUJST6|5.0|This is truly an emotionally compelling story of life and love...absolutely breathtaking. I can't believe that I actually sniffled through the journey, but some of the chapters are so heartrending that it just tore me apart. It's not a sad story; it is just so emotionally empowering, and the life circumstances that occur throughout the story are incredibly genuine. And so the story begins...<br /><br />Eighteen-year-old Layken (Lake), and her mom (Julia) and brother (Kel), just relocated from Texas to Michigan, shortly after the death of her father. Upon her arrival in their new home, she is introduced to her neighbor, twenty-one-year-old Will. Delightfully entertaining the way in which they meet is during Lake's attempt at the dramatics in playing a zombie attack on her brother, Kel, and his new friend, Caulder (Will's brother). Their handshake introduction is awkward in the fact that Will lingers a little too long with Lake's hand. But their innocence in the beginning is very sweet:  you only conclude that they will be very good neighbors.<br /><br />As the narrative progresses and a few pages later after Will and Lake grocery shop together, Will asks Lake on a date. Embarking upon their date a couple days later, the mysterious date place they arrive at is this Thursday night slam club.  And this is where the reader is introduced to the most beautifully profound poetry. The whole premise of this journey is the magic of the poetry and how brilliantly written it weaves in and out of the story... incredible! And it is at this point where the feelings for both characters begin to deepen.<br /><br />Undoubtedly, there is so much more to the story, but without giving spoilers away, both Will and Lake will run into many obstacles in their developing relationship; it almost appears hopeless. Couple that with life occurrences that are so emotionally moving and difficult to comprehend that the reader is compelled to complete the journey...so overwhelmingly touching!<br /><br />This is definitely one the most beautifully-written YA stories ever conveyed. Combined with the most remarkable characters, and enhanced further with the most sensational ending (first with Lake's poem about Will and then Will's poem to Lake), and you have one of the most beautiful stories ever read! Absolutely Fabulous! Kudos to the author Colleen Hoover! Highly Recommend!r />This is definitely one the most beautifully-written YA stories ever conveyed.

0345803485|5.0|I absolutely loved this book!  I could not put it down, and have read the second and third books in the series as well!  The series was an amazing love story, and I have recommended the books to all of my friends who are now reading them as well!  Everyone needs a Christian Grey in their life!  Don't hesitate to buy this book as well as Fifty Shades Darker and Fifty Shades Freed!  You will not be disappointed!
B005LAIH3G|5.0|There are maybe two or three times in my life that I have seen a movie that I like better than the original book material, and John Carter is one.  Yes, John Carter is not the best name for a movie, and personally, I never saw any promotion for the movie and only happened upon it through a friend, but I am so glad I did!  The movie does not waste a single scene; everything is important.  And, especially appealing for me is the fact that it makes you think and does not 'talk down' to the audience.  The performances are brilliant, and although the effects are good, the point of the movie is about a man rediscovering his humanity.  It is funny, engaging, and entertaining, much better than a lot of the comic book movies (which I do watch) that rely on special effects and barely have a story.  If you have not seen it, I encourage it, and then I encourage you to watch it again since it is better the second time.  It seems the movie was sacrificed for the removal of the VIP at Disney, and that is a shame since lots of people missed a movie that I'm sure they would have really enjoyed.  The book this is based on was the basis for Star Wars, Avatar, etc., so it is interesting to see the imagination of a story written 100 years ago.  Do yourself a favor and see the movie.
0307352145|4.0|Many introverts feel like they live in an extroverted world. We are often asked to learn in groups, share ideas in brainstorming sessions, and do our work in an open office plan because, well, socialization and collaboration are good, right?<br /><br />Not always, says Susan Cain in her book Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World that Can't Stop Talking. Between a third and a half of all people are introverts who thrive on, and are most creative in, solitude. In her book, Cain first looks at the Extrovert Ideal: the widespread belief in Western society that we should all aspire to be the charismatic, outgoing, take-charge type--in other words, an extrovert. Then Cain examines the biological background of temperament to explain why introverts are the way they are. In part three, which consists of one chapter, she asks whether all cultures have an extrovert ideal, and looks to Asian (particularly Asian-American) culture for an answer. In the final part of the book, Cain is most prescriptive: She tells her readers when introverts should act like extroverts, how to communicate with people of the opposite type, and how to raise introverted children in a culture that values extroversion more than introversion.<br /><br />As an introvert, I found this book fascinating and helpful. I like to read about introversion in general because it makes me feel less strange/crazy for enjoying solitude, for being more sensitive than most to external stimuli, and for clamming up when asked to share something impromptu in a group setting. Cain writes about all of these common introvert tendencies and more in this book. The only part of this book that I found my interest waning was when Cain was talking about various psychological experiments in the section on biology. That isn't a fault of the book, though; I am simply not as interested in that as I am in stories.<br /><br />And Cain does make plenty of room for stories about introverts, both famous (Eleanor Roosevelt, Warren Buffet, Gandhi) and otherwise. At the end of this book, while I was still conscious that the Extrovert Ideal is alive and well, I felt that because of books like this one (and the research it describes), now is a good time to be an introvert.Gandhi) and otherwise. At the end of this book, while I was still conscious that the Extrovert Ideal is alive and well, I felt that because of books like this one (and the research it describes), now is a good time to be an introvert.
B0063GORYU|3.0|I have this on my iphone and it is much better - same app from MobilityWare.  This app is totally inconsistent in how it plays the cards.  sometimes they go left sometimes right.  Sometimes they go to a space even when there is a viable card open.  Disappointing compared to the other platform.
0374275637|2.0|I am looking forward to reading this book. However, I guess I am working my way out of the old 'cast-in-concrete' paper book technologies. The FONT in the hardcover edition is just a tad too small. I should've bought it as an e-book where the font is adjustable. My 'bad', eh?!<br /><br />But I didn't see any such review, or comment, or caution on amazon, where I bought this book.<br /><br />I think I will return the book, unfortunately. And order the e-book version.<br /><br />I hope to write an amended review, more related to the book's content.<br /><br />Sorry. I am deeply disappointed.
B0000507R0|5.0|This review will not cover the music itself. It is probably ELP's best album and others have already commented in great detail about that aspect. However, there appears to be some confusion over the sound on this release. There are in fact 3 different sound tracks:<br /><br />DVD-Video sound - 5.1 Dolby Digital (AC-3) at 48 KHz, 16 bit, 448 Kbps<br />DVD-Audio sound - 5.1 MLP or 5.0 MLP at 96 KHz, 24 bit<br />DVD-Audio sound - Stereo Down mix - 2.0 MLP at 96 KHz, 24 bit<br /><br />If you have a standard DVD-Video player, you can only play the DVD-Video track. As it is in compressed AC-3 format, the sound is nowhere near as clear as the DVD-Audio sound tracks. MLP is a lossless form of compression and is thus equivalent to hearing the original PCM sound at 96 KHz, 24 bit resolution. 6 of the tracks are in 5.1 format, whereas \\"Still...\\", \\"Benny...\\" and \\"Karn Evil 9, Part 2\\" are in 5.0 format (No LFE track).<br /><br />If you thought that was confusing, it gets even worse. Playing this disk on a DVD-Audio player, you can watch some \\"promo videos\\" in low resolution stereo. Next, on my DVD-Audio player, the digital output from the player is Left front+Right Front only. \\"Karn Evil 9, Part 2\\" has Emerson and Palmer on the Left/Right tracks and Lake on the Centre track. Thus, if you listen to this track via digital out, there is little or no bass!<br /><br />On my player, the only way to hear the 5.1 DVD-Audio sound track is via the Analogue Outputs. In addition, there is no way on my player to select the stereo down mix track. Also, the sound quality of the analogue outputs is inferior to the digital output.<br /><br />At this point, you may start to despair of ever hearing the disk in high quality! However, there is a solution. On a Windows PC, you can install a DVD-Audio Decoder plugin for the foobar2000 audio player. Then, you can open the file called AUDIO_TS.IFO and all the DVD-Audio tracks on the album, 5.1 and 2.0, can then be played.<br /><br />The quality of thesefiles is quite amazing. The remix has been done tastefully and you can hear much more detail than was on the original CD or vinyl. However, as others have commented, you need good rear speakers as well as good front speakers if you want to hear the entire album as the engineer intended. Armed with this information, maybe those who do not like the sound on this re-mix may now be able to appreciate this release.

B001E45XT4|5.0|For the price, this is a great headset. The adjustment band is a little loose and the inline volume control feels a bit cheap, but that shouldn't be a deterrent from buying this. I'm not an audiophile, so the sound is just fine to me. The pads do an okay job of muffling outside sounds. Don't expect total silence. They are actually pretty comfortable too. The microphone did take a bit of tweaking to get the volume to a good point. Actually it's either a little loud or a little soft for my preferences, but that is due to my software.  Overall, I've very happy.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was amazing so much so I immediately bought the second book so that I would not miss a beat.  Must read the book prior to seeing the movie or the movie will not be great.

0765348780|2.0|If you like digging ditches for no greater pleasure than to feel the sweat running off your face, you might like Gardens of the Moon. Every positive review on here says you have to put in effort to enjoy this series of books. What they don't say, is that that effort results in a satisfaction no greater than digging a ditch and seeing the product of your own labor. The book doesn't reward the reader in any literary sense I recognize. [I'm not a shallow reader; Foucault's Pendulum is what I would consider a great novel (albeit a hundred pages too long).] Many people say Erikson is a good writer. But good writers don't make their readers dig through hundreds and hundreds of pages to find, well, nothing, really. Good writers don't make each paragraph a mind-twisting jumble of MFA-program-inspired pretentious prose. Good writers have something to say. This book simply tosses a bunch of characters into the wind, leaving the reader to watch as they are blown away and to ponder the vast insignificance of it all.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|This game is pretty fun so far. Upgrades and allies are great and gameplay is smooth. Plus it's free. What's not to enjoy?
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I bought this book because I wanted something light. This fit the bill. I read it in a few short days and mostly enjoyed it. The email exchanges between the main characters were playful and fun, and there were aspects of their relationship that I found engaging. I did begin to detest the repetitive nature of the writing. I have never encountered such an abuse of the words \\"muttered\\" and \\"murmured\\", for example. If you are up for a trashy novel, this is that. I am weighing the idea of purchasing the rest of the series because although I found it somewhat predictable,I would be lying if I said I wasn't curious about how it all ends. But I don't know if I can stomach any more lip biting and murmuring.

B0007YNRTK|3.0|I actually bought this soundtrack after hearing the song \\"Across 110th Street\\" on Entourage (during the credits). I had forgotten how good a song it is by Bobby Womack, so I explored further. I don't believe it is on his greatest hits, but if it is, I suggest getting that over this soundtrack. The disk is pretty short in length and at times really felt like a soundtrack minus the movie, which of course changes the music.<br /><br />However, not bad music and would not be a bad pick up if you like seventies style music (think police or chase scene music from the seventies).
1741798981|4.0|This guide is loaded with lots of half-page maps of different areas of London, plus has quite a few pages of somewhat larger maps in the back, plus a large removable map that unfolds. Maps are very important to me. I liked how there is a good sized list of museums of all sorts... the awesome museums are such an important part of London. Lots of tips and useful information throughout the book, including a very interesting historical summary. The main reason I don't give 5 stars is that I thought the photos could have been more plentiful and better chosen... I like a lot of photos, but then I do recognize that the book might become too large.
1400069289|4.0|I found the book to be helpful in some basic ways and potentially helpful in some larger ways. At a minimum the book got me thinking about how I can change some bad habits and how to make my team and individual work more effective. The author had a clever way to keep the stories going throughout the chapters so it kind of read like an academic novel, as he did not reveal results right away and keeps you reading more.<br /><br />The simple idea of \\"Cue > Routine > Reward\\" is not revolutionary, but the examples where fascinating and can be applied to so many things. It has made me think about certain cues (what makes me bite by nails? when I sit on the couch and watch Met's games or Syracuse Orange games I always bit my nails. Trying not to by holding a magazine or book or something to keep me from putting my nails in my mouth) and how I can change habits and create some good ones. This book kind of reminded me of \\"Who Moved my Cheese\\" where the premise is simple, but the impact can spread and be thought about in different ways.<br /><br />Unless someone is perfect or does not want to change anything, this is a good book to understand how organizations, people, and societies work and how and why many of us do what we do (from Michael Phelps success in swimming to understanding a major gambling problem). Approach the book open minded and a lot of good can result.

0312576463|5.0|I found \\"The Corrections\\" so painful--as toxic and bitter as battery acid--that I couldn't finish it.  I am, therefore, very surprised to be giving \\"Freedom\\" five stars.  The opening pages are so spectacularly well written that I was worried that this was going to be the kind of novel so enraptured by its own pretty words that I'd be fast asleep by page fifty.  In fact, \\"Freedom\\" has a wide-ranging plot covering politics, the environment, women's sports, pop music, and relationships.  The characters are not exactly cute and cuddly, but within a few words of dialog, you feel you've known them forever.  Despite the alcoholism, the negativity, the narcissism, and the self-loathing, this is somehow one of the most romantic books ever written.
B005VTS4EY|4.0|This is actually a fun and challenging game. Each level offers something different and I enjoy working out the logistics to find the answer.

B000W91RUG|1.0|This show is really like black face for nerds.  It is as insulting to real nerds as black face was to African-Americans.  There's a one of every nerd-type! And then a hot girl who makes fun of their social ineptitude?  Wow!  Who would have thought that up? Oooooh, man!  They have catch-phrases?  Sign me up!<br /><br />Last, a thought on canned laughter.  It is insulting to the viewer.  It says, \\"You're too stupid to know when it's funny, so we'll let you know when to laugh.\\"  Researchers found out a long time ago that laughter is a social experience and that people are more likely to laugh when they see or hear others laughing, so they make use of fake laughter to elicit laughs when something is not actually funny.<br /><br />You want a show that treats nerds with some heart?  Watch Community.  It doesn't default to lazy writing and canned laughter. Also, it's actually good.
B007V2UGPE|2.0|All Glu Mobile games make you jump through hoops or pay real money if you want to continue playing their games. Every game uses some sort of credits or coins for you to gain access to levels or equipment that you eventually need to progress. You can either click on ads and download other junk to your phone or tablet, or pony up cash to buy your way through. Some of Glu's games offer credit/coin packs upwards of $200 for the largest pack. Who in their right mind would spend that on a mobile game when Xbox or Playstation games cost $60? They ease you in, make sure you're havin fun, then you'll reach a point that you're unable to progress unless you go through numerous additional downloads, credit applications or car insurance quotes. Glu Mobile is one of the worst offenders of this type of extorsion. If you really wanna try it, play as far as you can and then uninstall it. Its not worth the headaches in the long run.
B005OOSPZO|5.0|The picture and sound quality are great and the story covers some of the finer contextual details that aren't typically discussed in a classroom setting. Which are fascinating as a strong effort was made to ensure complete historical accuracy. There isn't a boring scene in it.

0345803485|4.0|So first off let me say this is not a book meant to win Pulitzers and other literary achievements. It is an untraditional love story with strong sexual undertones. Not the best writing in the world but I think she makes up for it with the strong make lead. I love the way she developed the male character, but not so much the female lead/narrator. Aside from that I really enjoyed the book and have since ordered the 2nd and 3rd in the trilogy. If you are looking for classic strong book writing this may not be the book for you, if you are looking for traditional sexual situations this may not be the book for you.... but if you want a (in my opinion) tantalizing, aggressive, sometimes creepy, irresistible love story they I think you may like it.
B007B8EX9I|5.0|I love this series and missed an episode.  This was a quick efficient way to catch up. I downloaded and watched it at my leisure and the entire process was easy to do.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I really enjoyed The Hunger Games. It was very well written and an easy read. I would definitely recommend reading this book, as well as the other two in the series. You can't believe what you are reading - but it's not too gruesome or unbelievable. There are enough parallels between our world today and the made up world of Panem.
