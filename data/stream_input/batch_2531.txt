B000MKD9P6|4.0|I love Meryl Streep in this movie.  She plays her character very well.  This cast of characters appear together in several movies, but they are highly believable in each one.
B00008WT5E|5.0|This is classic AC/DC with their original singer. This will keep you rocking from the first song until the last. A must buy.
B008TMA1LY|5.0|This is super cute it`s fun for every one you can even hire people<br />With point but I only have 5 :(
B008F5Y7UQ|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies. The dialogue is amazing. I have seen it 3 times and will see it more!
B0082SU98U|2.0|Fools,<br />It is some time since I, Professor Emeritus Johnstone, have taken up quill and ink to share my knowledge and analytical prowess with you, the swinish sweating masses. However, I could not ignore Amazon's mewling entreaties to return as Chief Editor Emeritus for long. I had instructed my man-child, Bates, to put any correspondence from that swindling hound, Bezos, straight into the flames. In this manner, I have been able to ignore his manipulative missives, often threatening legal action. However, Bates has recently come down with one of the worst cases of scarlatina I have seen this side of the Atlantic. And so, poor fool I, this delicate and most important task fell to my unstable and spiteful biddy. Lo and behold, over a simple breakfast of salt cake and radishes, the horrible woman delivered into my hands a crisp envelope with the all-too-familiar masthead of the Garamond & Ganymede esq. With trembling fingers (and assistance from my biddy--oh, how I grow old and fade!) I ripped open the creamy embossed paper and began to read:<br /><br />Dear Sir,<br />Unless this letter receives a written response by the end of the month, Jeff Bezos and Amazon.com will have no choice but to seek legal action and compensation...<br /><br />I crumpled the letter, tears welling in my eyes. I had known that they wanted me to return to writing. I knew, too, that the world needed to share and splash in the deep fount of my knowledge before I, too, shuffled off this mortal candle, as the fellow says. Yes yes.<br /><br />I admit, my mind was distracted through Vespers and Martins both. Every time I encountered the simplest Doxology, I returned to thoughts of glory and honor as Chief Editor Emeritus. That night, my biddy snoring her hideous head off, I could not sleep. The night rabbit would not visit me (\\"die Nacht Kaninchen nicht besuchen\\"), to stuff us with his delicious sleep carrots (as my now-deceased mother used to say when I, a mewling babe, would toss and turn andbeg for her bosom). I gave up my efforts and, putting on my warmest horsehair vest and cassock to ward off the chill of the coming dawn, went to my library.<br /><br />Alas, I have read essentially every book in both my native tongue and English, as well as Latin, Greek, and Norman (or, as the nanny-state would have it, \\"French\\"), I was at a loss for what to read. I despise re-reading books, an activity for sodomites and horse thieves. I, an emeritus professor of American Literature (retired) and current Adjunct Professor of Grammar and Geography at New Delhi School of Television and Film (yes, I shamefully admit, I have been forced to seek employment in my exile here in Darkest India), have a 100% retention of every word I have ever read. How else, hated reader, do you think I can quote with ease in these reviews. No, foolish boys, I do not pull these \\"Harks!\\" and \\"Prithees\\" out of thin air; I am not a great writer like  a Boswell or Walter Scott. All I have is my keen mind.<br /><br />No matter.<br /><br />Finding no solace in my collection, I tripped gently through the house, seeking distraction and nourishment for my hungry and restless mind, so like a small child clawing at my arm for a piece of rock candy. Well, rock candy I would give it. And by \\"rock candy,\\" of course, I mean, great literature.<br /><br />Tripping over a pair of socks and garters left in the hallway by that useless man-child, Bates, I stormed into his room, birch branch in hand in preparation to thrash him. However, on seeing his innocent face and scarlatina-swollen body gently sleeping, my womanish heart melted. I kindly decided to save the thrashing until the morning. Turning to leave, I espied a book half open by the man-child's bed. It was almost farcical; we all know the leftist legend of the mongoloid who will bring knowledge and peace to world. So it was with this half-witted oaf who ironed my collars and starched my jute robes brought rest to my troubled and hungry mind in the form of his only possession, a copy of some filthy novel called Pollyanna.<br /><br />Clasping this treasure to my chest, I retreated at once to my reading basket for further study. Lighting a pomander for protection against a both noxious airs and, more pressingly, a vengeful Bates, I tore at once into the leftist rubbish by the so-called Eleanor \\"H\\" Porter.<br /><br />Where do I, Professor Emeritus Johnstone, even begin with this Taftian-sympathizing and, frankly, profane waste of good parchment?  The plot, for lack of a better descriptive noun, involves a sanguine young child by the unlikely name of Pollyanna who, by the Lord God Our Savior, is sensibly deprived of parents (no doubt they, on encountering the sinful spawn of their loins immediately sought solitude in prayer, hoping upon hope that they might die and rid themselves of their troublesome infant). Having no other recourse but to burden society with her burdens, she is sent to her aunt, confusingly named Polly.<br /><br />Now I, Professor Emeritus Johnstone, enjoy a challenging book as much as the next professor (unless that professor is that fiend in human form, Jenkins. More on this anon). However, this sloppy naming left even my goat-pen of a mind reeling with befuddlement. Apparently this \\"Eleanor\\" character was infected by that literary plague known as \\"Modernism\\" in which bad writing is proudly paraded as art. These impostors actively encourage and reward this sort of Pollyanna/Polly disgrace.  After a mere eleven pages, I had no choice but to rest with some restorative passages from the Gospel of Thomas.<br /><br />But I digress. Back to the issue at hand, namely how Polly nee Pollyanna proceeds to be a general nuisance and pest. Now, I hate to compare the plight of a weak and pea-brained female to myself (Professor Emeritus Johnstone), but I was orphaned at the tender age of two. I had no similarly-named relative I could milk for shekels and valuable life-lessons. Instead, I packed my few belongings and made my way to the nearest farm. There, I was employed by the hard-hearted but god-fearing farmer, Howard. Howard, though a tyrant, was generous--he allowed me to keep any stone I unearthed while toiling in the field. Those stones kept me warm during the cold winter nights and taught me everything I know. I owe all my current success and genius to those early years.<br /><br />How does this blister, Polyanna, repay her unearned luck? By annoying everyone with needless optimism. The meanest child of Pollyanna's age should have read and absorbed Ecclesiastes several times over. Pollyanna, though, flies in the face of our Lord and Savior and insists that everything will and shall be wonderful, despite all evidence to the contrary. In his rage, Our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ sees fit to punish this pestilential little newt by striking her with an automobile. In his foresight, Our Lord keeps the girl alive, unable to walk, to reflect on her wickedness and sin. I see from my research that Eleanor H. \\"Porter\\" wrote ELEVEN MORE of these frightful abortions. One  can only assume that in the remaining books Polyanna takes these valuable lessons to heart and devotes her life to the Lord's work like I, Professor Emeritus Johnstone, did.<br /><br />Now, dear reader, I have done my utmost to keep myself out of these reviews. I make mention of myself only when absolutely necessary to elucidate a particularly tricky theoretical or philosophical point. However, you must forgive me in this instance, for I must tell a story about my own life; it is the only way to understand my extremely genius thesis on Pollyanna. When I was a young Professor Emeritus, on the brink of a major breakthrough in my field, Comparative Liturgy and American Literature at a school that, for certain complex reasons, I cannot name, I was tricked by a deceitful Adjunct Professor by the name of Alphonso Taft (who would go on to father an unnamed future Governor-General of the Phillipines and all-around cadwith the same last name. I can say no more.). Alphonso stole everything from me, as the Lord saw fit to steal the gift of mobility from Pollyanna. However I, Professor Emeritus Johnstone, had no sheltering aunt in whose apron-strings I could cry. All I had was my horrible Biddy, Bates, my collection of illicit lithographs, and my rapidly dwindling fortune. Luckily I managed to salvage my several thousand pages of original research. I can say no more; suffice it to say I was no longer welcome at the high table at the college. I had no choice but flee to Darkest India.<br /><br />After completing this insipid novel, I discovered that Walter Disney made a film of this book. Apparently my Biddy owns a copy of this film (note for Bates: remind me to punish Biddy). I watched and enjoyed it thoroughly.<br /><br />Now swine, I must leave you. Until next time. Please find enclosed my Biddy's newest recipe for gruel.<br /><br />GRUEL:<br />Serves 2<br /><br />Ingredients:<br />3 kg pea gravel<br />100 hulled oats (horse grade)<br />4 liters well water<br />3 ml vinegar<br />30 fresh huckleberry skins.<br /><br />Directions:<br />Poach oats in vinegar until soft. Fold in huckleberry skins until fumes subside. Transfer ingredients to double boiler (large) with water and bring to temperature. When huckleberries reach proper mixing color, gently dump pea gravel into pot. Skim bubbles and detritus with a large spoon. Simmer for at least three days. Refrigerate (covered) for consumption.<br /><br />Fare Thee Well and Pray For Me,<br />Professor Emeritus Johnstone
B005LAIH2C|4.0|Was surprised by how much I liked it ... particularly considering all the negative reviews this movie has been hit with.<br /><br />Thing is, I don't EXPECT much when starting to watch a film called HANSEL & GRETEL: WITCH HUNTERS; no eloquent writing, no intense plot, and certainly not a whole lot of character development. Nope.  I would expect action, CGI (perhaps some cheesy CGI), larger-than-life characters, and a plot that might occasionally make me laugh with what it expects its audience to believe.  When I go to Burger King, I don't expect a steak.<br /><br />And THAT is what I got! Much like 'Van Helsing' (which I also sort of liked, sorry), this film is a lot of craziness, dramatic acting, overblown violence/gore ... and I thoroughly enjoyed the ride. Hansel & Gretel, since successfully burning the witch who was going to eat them as children, have in the years since become professional witch hunters who routinely eradicate villages of their local hags ... for a price. They meet their match, however, when paid to help a village - most of the residents of which hate them for, they feel, drawing witches and death to their village in the first place - and instead come across one powerful grand-witch (Famke Janssen) with plans of her own for the brother/sister pair. Lots of blood, cool weaponry, dismemberment, sarcastic remarks, and both awesome and lame CGI makes for a goulash of insanity that - yeah - I still liked a lot.<br /><br />The film in NO WAY takes itself seriously; do yourself a favor and approach it the same way.  It's popcorn for the mind, and pretends to be nothing more.
B009NY43NY|2.0|i used to be hooked on the series, and even enthusiastically read the \\"bad\\" ones, but this one just killed the series for me.. although it doesn't really matter since it's the last book<br />maybe that was what ms. harris' wanted?
B00007LTIC|4.0|Released in 1977, `Going for the One' saw the return of Rick Wakeman to the band (absent since 1973's TfTO project) and is considered by many fans to be Yes' last truly great album.<br /><br />The original album contained just 5 tracks: all good, tight pieces in varying styles. The title track is classic Yes, an uplifting rocker with eccentric rhythm and time-changes delivered with gusto and virtuoso playing from the whole band, particularly Steve Howe on slide guitar as a counterpoint to Jon Anderson's soaring falsetto. Other highlights are the hit-single `Wondrous Stories' (not all Yes fans like WS, but it's a great, memorable song which has proved popular through the decades) and the long closer `Awaken', a classically ambitious extended Yes number complete with huge organ, church choir harmonies and multiply-layered melodic & rhythmic motifs.<br /><br />The Rhino `expanded & re-mastered' edition offers an extra 7 tracks, 4 of which are less-polished studio run-throughs of the album tracks. The remainder are instrumentals which didn't make the final cut of the original 1977 Atlantic Records release, and include Chris Squire's inventive rendition of `Amazing Grace' on bass guitar which he often performed live on stage during this period.<br /><br />The Rhino edition has an excellent sound mix, a 20-page colour booklet insert with all the song lyrics and 80 minutes of great music. If you don't have this classic Yes album in your collection, it's the One to Go for.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|The game is fun and easy to do. I enjoy the building and the different levels. It is a pretty picture.
B0036TGSIK|5.0|Smart romantic comedy.  Great story.  The movie flows nicely with a good balance of laughs and a meaningful storyline.  All of the actors were very good.
B0035JGYZS|3.0|I saw this in the movie theaters when it first came out, but only watched it once. I thought it was a pretty good movie. But I watched it again a few days ago and must say it's not really all that great. It does have some interesting plot lines, but it is lacking in depth.
B001UV4XUG|4.0|The life is lived forward and understood backward concept was well done.  This is a movie that can be watched many times and give many different points.
B00499NHLC|5.0|A well-written, intriguing show. The characters of Sherlock and Watson are well-cast, and storylines engaging. It is also fairly fast-paced. I highly recommend watching this series.
B0034G4P4O|4.0|Animation was great.  Visuals were impressive through the whole movie.  Enjoyed the story.  The actors do a great job bringing the characters to life.
B001QJUX24|5.0|The other 3 are The Quiet Man, The Cowboys, and The Shootist. This cast is packed with some of the best character actors ever. Based on a true story, a true American gem, The country is another cast member, beautifully filmed.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|My wife and I played this together. Visually engaging and very fun to play. Can't wait for the next installment of this one!
B007KZY1YY|4.0|Though the second book of the trilogy, plot keeps interesting. Sex scenes keep repeating and may be tiring but overall this is an easy reading to cool your mind.
B008X8RSTM|2.0|Works OK when database is complete but found large data gaps for my area. Would be great if more data was available.
B00CL68QVQ|2.0|I enjoyed the book a lot. But the movie changed everything including characters. Maybe I would have liked it if I haven't read the book first.
B000022TSY|4.0|This is an all time classic movie from the 60's and early 70's eras. Really nice bikes shown in this movie!
B009NY43NY|5.0|She never had a future with Eric or Bill. The Tiger was a disappointment  She always loved Sam. So why is anyone surprised?
B001TH16DI|5.0|If you like Star Trek The Original series movies, then you just simply have to have this one in your collection.
B0085OEA9U|4.0|Even though there's little back story to the main character, I find him compelling (and not just because he's gorgeous).  A man who's lived his life completely for business and random self gratification, finds that he wants to change but has no clue how.  The complexities of human relationships, which he's always avoided are, in fact, more difficult than he thought.  It's interesting to see him, at middle age, start to grow a heart.  First rate acting.  Terrific cast.  Good directing, editing, and writing.  A first rate film.  I reserve 5 stars for absolute classics, otherwise, this was first rate.
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|Unless you have lived in the slums of Asia, this book will enlighten you immensely about what it is like to be one of the billions of humans who live in these conditions. On top of that, it's one of the most riveting stories you'll ever find. We don't know exactly which events in this fictionalized autobiography actually happened as described, but clearly this author lived a fantastic life for many years in India. It's a big, long novel; I wished it was twice as long.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|I love leps world! it is much much better than the first one. the dude is so cool and it is just an awesome game
B006LSZECO|3.0|A bookclub book that I regret buying. While it was entertaining, it was also very simply written and rather predictable.  I wish I could have borrowed this from the library.
B005TBN3EU|1.0|I enjoyed \\"The Hangover\\" and I was expecting to like \\"The Hangover II\\". However I was very disappointed. The movie was not funny, and it was a waste of my time and money.
B00COGZ8FU|3.0|It was slow and so deliberate... Tom was boring, no romance he always got the girl and he cannot pull off a real drama.
B000IDGBWU|5.0|One of my favorite movies of all time. I can't believe he's gone! He will be truly missed! Movie is worth watching!
B00BF123WG|1.0|I cannot imagine that our Countries Security was dealt with in the was this movie depicted by smart ass field agents and non supportive leaders.
B00821OUT6|2.0|I'm giving this 2 stars. The scenery and the wardrobe/makeup was done well. That is where it stops.<br /><br />The BAD (Spoilers)<br />1) The whole world has been taken over... WHY IN THE **** IS EVERYONE SO CONCERNED ABOUT ONE KID (BEN). Can we find something bigger to worry about then this guys son? This guy has 3 Boys and one gets grabbed. We spend a whole season hearing about how we have to get Ben back. WHO ****ING CARES!?!? We (the audience) have never met Ben. But it gets worse. I'm on episode 5 now and in the horrible efforts to rescue Ben they managed to get 2 people shot and another person kidnapped.<br />2) The main character is awful!!! Why is the second in command an English teacher with 3 sons providing constant conflict of interest on crucial missions? Not a hunter, cop, soldier, athlete of any kind, but a history teacher. He is an awful shot, terrible in a fistfight, doesn't even hold a gun properly, and has bleeding heart syndrome on every mission. I kid you not EVERY MISSION THIS GUY GOES ON HE SCREWS UP. Someone gets shot, captured, and the survivors come back ****ed up without the supplies they were sent to retrieve.<br /><br />I swear to you I watched each episode just hoping that it would get better. There is NO WAY, NOT ONE, that the main characters would have survived 24hours in this world. RAGING incompetence. RAGING!
B005RUUUAI|5.0|I began watching this with my husband after everyone I know talked about it. I watched the very first one about 2 months ago<br />and I thought, &#34;THIS IS STUPID&#34;, but I could not quit watching them. We watched all of the season within the last month and I can't wait until it comes back on......
B00992CF6W|5.0|it just rocks. you can build whatever you want. you should get it. it is the best game ever. buy it.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I check my face book every night. It is a way to keep in contact with ones that live far away. I have<br />also found friends I went to school with through face book................ love it and the games it offers
B007EECSFA|5.0|This is only the second novel by Kate Morton that I've read (the first being The Secret Garden, which I also loved), and I couldn't put it down!  And I must say I've never read a novel that surprised me like this one did, with a twist I never saw coming!  I LOVED IT!!!  :-)
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Disgusting, demeaning, egotistic and sick. What is our world coming to?  No wonder our society is deteriorating in rapid fashion
B001XUPH9K|5.0|Have seen this one several times and will probably see it again someday.  It's one of the best Star Trek films ever!
B0094BB4TW|1.0|....but I can't.  I have tried re-downloading to no avail.  Facebook simply won't load on my new Kindle Fire and I am very unhappy about it.  I see that many other people have had problems with Facebook loading on their Kindles.  My Kindle even came with facebook preloaded....not sure why if it doesn't work.  Major bummer!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Downloaded this early ones morning and have not put it down since. I am not a gamer but this has me hooked. Awesome game!!
B009LDXQGW|5.0|This product is in good condition. I don't like the way the case is made, but I don't think that's your fault.
B003G4W49C|4.0|I really enjoyed this book as a stand alone book. It answered all the questions, and left on a note that left me feeling satisfied. I have chosen not to read the rest of the series, because this book, imho, needed no sequel. Some stories should stand alone. Be classics. This is one.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This is a great game for kids because it teaches them the responsibilities of caring for a pet. It is a great for my children
B008IJT0CE|5.0|TONS of sounds to choose from! There's got to be something for everybody in this app!<br />Nice user interface, as well.
B00942G4UA|5.0|One of many food and informative documentaries regarding food and health. It's time to watch all of these movies about the food we consume and how it can affect your health. Knowledge is powerful. We have choices about what we eat. Start voting at the check stands. Visit your local farmers markets.
0307352153|5.0|This explained many mysteries in my own behaviour. Now I can explain myself to myself to a greater degree and have a more accurate idea of what this stranger I inhabit may do in the future.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Flynn's portrayal of the characters is layered but they all still come off as barely likeable... His &#34;gone girl&#34; is a textbook study of the sociopathic personality - intriguing because most literary portrayals of this type are cast as males...
B00BTZN91C|5.0|Another great album from a great band. It doesn't disappoint at all. I am going to be hearing this one all summer long.
B002U5HKZ6|3.0|When I started reading this book I thought it was going to be the best book I had read since &#34;Cutting for Stone.&#34; Well, no not quite. Roberts is a terrific writer. No question about that. Too bad Roberts didn't turn this in to two or three books...He just doesn't seem to know when to stop. His very believable character starts to turn into a super hero with a little too much slapping himself on the back. The book would have been better had he just stayed in the slums or escaped to Sri Lanka and lived happily ever after with one of the interesting prostitutes he introduces us to...maybe he does that. I still have a couple hundred pages to drag myself through.
193700788X|3.0|I hardly could wait for the release of this book.  But I was so disappointed.  It was not up the  usual standards of Charlaine Harris.  It was almost like someone else wrote it. I was very let down.
B00498YZH8|5.0|This is Academy Award Winner Jennifer Lawrence's true break-out role. It reminds me of old noire style movies., retold today.  A teenage girl must find her missing dad, or the family will lose their land, which was pledged to the bail bondsman.  Set in the Missouri Ozarks, the film is filled with twists as people try to stop her from discovering the truth.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use it to help me remember things and its great for taking quick pics uh notes to remember great for quick notes
B002XXNSF6|5.0|acting is outstanding for this movie. look at the way they look at each other. look at how they can't stop looking at talking to each other.
B008IJT0CE|4.0|It's a great idea, and it works well. Tons of different sounds. Two small cons:<br />1. I don't see a way to save any favorites<br />2. It's impossible to change the volume of an individual sound easily after it's been added to the mix. You have to delete it and add it in again.
B0063GORYU|3.0|A little challenging for my geriatric eyes.  If I turn my device horizontally, it's easier to work with.  For the price, it's not bad at all.
B005K17RU0|4.0|AccuWeather is the most accurate weather forecast I have come across. The National Weather Service is 2nd, but the one that comes with my IPhone, Weather is probably the worst one I have ever seen. It doesn't even get our town listed correctly. AccuWeather is not always right and changes somewhat, but for the most part it is the best one.
B00A8MGIZG|5.0|I will make this short and brief. This was a very deep movie on so many levels. Six stories woven into this complex but somewhat comprehensive design. Be ready to sit and really watch this movie. It is a lot to take in and I can understand if some people didn't like it. The movie pulls you in and then makes you work to understand what it is happening. Even Tom Hanks stated he read the script and knew he had to do it but didn't understand what the hec he would be doing. It took a lot of effort for the actors to absorb not only one role but 6! Cloud Atlas is about boundaries, connection, morality, and a little love. It is about 3 hours at least almost. By near the end of the movie I was crying, understanding this movie on such a deeper level that I couldn't even explain it to you. Or try. It got to my core and I took it personally in such a powerful way. You will love it or hate it. I thought it was profound. Not as ingenious as Inception, but definitely an exploration of film that I never saw before.
B0063IH60K|3.0|I like it but do not like all the ads that pop up before the game. It is a great time waster~
B0017QSZW6|5.0|If you love English history during the reign of Henry VIII, you will enjoy The Tudors! While it may not be historically accurate, the story is still there, and fascinating it is. i am always anxious to watch the next episode.
B008602KQI|3.0|I'm glad I read the books first or so much of the story would have made no sense. I still gave it 3 stars because there were some very good special effects.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|Telling this story from Jack's perspective is emotionally effective, raw and vulnerable.  Reading this book was an awful, joyful source of wonder that I won't soon forget.
1616550414|5.0|This book is incredible and is full of great, detailed concept art from the last 25 years of Zelda games. Any fan of the series or even art books in general will like this book. Amazon has done a great job with this item as well. They stopped selling it for a short time because people were receiving them with scratched covers and dented corners. They've gone above and beyond to fix this problem by shipping the book inside of a tight-fitting box within the shipping box. It's really hard to believe they sell this book for just $20.
0061906220|5.0|A joy to read and with the online site providing the reading of the book for your child to read along with, it is totally awesome.  Love Pete the Cat and his message that no matter what &#34;It is all good&#34; !!
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|This was a much better movie then I thought it would be. Jack Reacher could have been played by someone over 6'
1582701709|5.0|Ordered this for a friend and haven't heard whether she likes the book or not?  I know she wanted it.
B004Z2TUGE|3.0|This is another super-hero movie, with a twist off the norm. I found it entertaining and the quality was very good. The plot was a little close to superman---aliens fighting a war across the galaxy and ending up on earth --type of plot, but done in away different enough to entertain as a 'new twist&#34; on an old usbject.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Excellent way to pass the time. I enjoyed the first version, but this version is more fun and interesting. Definitely recommend it for mindless entertainment.
B00CRWJ5GO|4.0|The high quality of the impeccable actor was very apparent in this movie. The acting was astounding and the story line was one that was most difficult to make believable...but they did! This is one of the best acted movies of the year, if not in the past ten years, that I've had the pleasure to view.
030758836X|4.0|For 90% of the book I say kudos to Gillian Flynn. She had me hooked from the beginning. Her storytelling is very contemporary, realistic, and believable. Her idea to alternate characters, Amy telling her story through her diary, and Nick telling his story in the moment was excellent and kept me turning the page. As I would finish a chapter from Amy's point of view, I couldn't wait to finish the Nick chapter so I could get back to Amy. But then as I finished from Nick's point of view, I couldn't wait to get to Nick's next chapter. Many writers these days tend to write chapters from the point of view of different characters which I find interesting but sometimes confusing, and not once did I have to remind myself from whose point of view the chapter was from - that takes tremendous writing ability. Another aspect of the book that demonstrates a great skill in storytelling is the way Flynn gets the reader to connect with the characters. I was amazed at how I felt disgust for Nick and empathy for Amy and in the blink of an eye, my feelings reversed. I don't know that I've ever read a book that caused my feelings for the characters to flip flop in such a way. Also, without giving too much away, I will say that the \\"perfect crime\\" that is the basis of the storyline is so unbelievable that it's believable. Nick says once in the book \\"the bigger the lie, the more believable\\" and I think that's a perfect description of the storyline. The book was utterly amazing...until the last 10%. As other reviewers have stated, the ending was boring, anticlimactic, and just really a let down which is so sad considering how intriguing the rest of the book is. Even with the disappointing ending, I'm glad I read the book and would recommend it to others.
B0017ZB8M6|5.0|Of course I will put in 5 star great CD! I am a Katycat after all! What kind of super fan doesn't put in 5 stars for their idol?!
B009GX6600|5.0|I've wanted to see an episode that concluded Season 9, but didn't realize that I could purchase Season 10 at amazon.com. I was able to view the missed episode on my spare time, as well as watching all the episodes of the season. Convenience and price are the main reason for loving this product.
B007VYDFMS|5.0|I love reggae music and Bob Marley was the best.  It was a very interesting documentary and told a lot about Rastafarianism.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I have never done a Jillian Michaels Workout ever and I was a little skeptical based on the mixed reviews but decided what the heck. I absolutely love this and her \\"tough love\\" style. I almost find it comical and it gets me through the whole 25mins (yes only 25 mins). I'm no stranger to workouts, You will usually find me in the gym at least 5 days a week, doing a mix of cross fit, weights and cardio. I have also done insanity. Needless to say I don't have much/any weight to loose but It has only been a week and my muscle tone and stamina have improved (Each day I do a different level to keep from burnout/monotony.) I also purchased 6 week six pack (It's no Joke) and No More Trouble Zones, both of which are great to mix in. Honestly if you can find 25 minutes (yes I'm a mom of a busy 2 year old so I know it can be tough) then what are you waiting for?!
B009IF8CH6|5.0|I enjoy watching big bang theory. Funny show. I only heard about this show 2013. Where the heck has it been.
B00992CF6W|5.0|its really fun and cool. almost like the pc version.<br />I love to be able to take minecraft with me now.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is the ultimate. I don't see any reason why someone would not like this game.In subway surfers, the characters are amazing.
B00BGIC2J2|1.0|Just a bunch of people fighting and complaining the whole time.  All negativity and no humor.  Turned it off less than half way through.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is absolutely the best game ever it test your creative in the two gamemode options you have to survive the night from monsters and make armor tools and food in survival and just be creative in creative mode the possibilities are endless<br />great for the family
B005DOKL3E|4.0|like the color, zips easily. It is a little tight, could have been a little bigger, as I use a stylus with it.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|This game is really fun. At the beginning it might be alittle confusing but after a while you'll enjoy it. There is also more to it than just creating a village and keeping check with what goes on in it.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This book was a real page turner for me.  I recommend it to anyone who likes a what-if book that never stops.
B00AESN8XY|4.0|I spent about 20$ or more on adons that's how good it is but needs some updates if u like games where u can destroy the planet this is the game to get
B00BFIFIPS|5.0|Love the fit and color. Very slim and doesn't add bulk to the phone. Wish the lip was higher up so the screen won't scratch but it still protects
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is now a five star reveiw because last night at 10:00 I got the minecraft 0.7.0 update its so cool there's cake buckets fire smooth lighting lighting it released my kindle fire thanks amazon it was released sooner than I expected.
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|This game is very comparable to battlefield 3, except it's cartoony and there I  no bloods. They game play is great, but the vehicles could use a little more defense sense basic units can take them down in two hits. All in all this game it great and I recommend it to anyone.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Excellent fun! !! Highly addictive, couldn't put it down once I started playing. Fun exciting keeps you trying to go further over and over again. Love this game definitely worth downloading and free too!!!
B0087HT36U|4.0|this is a great game. exciting and fun to play<br />.I have enjoyed playing it very much. ..l would rate it higher except for being forced. to rate it to finish the last level....<br /><br />.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I think that it is a really good app and there is a really good variety of games but I think that you should unlock new games by getting high scores on games not paying
B00AVPYT8I|2.0|Probably would like it, however it will not load on my Kindle HD so this is really not a far judgment :)
B005PK56TA|4.0|Watched the first season in one weekend. looking forward to season 2 being available. Not appropriate for children though, so watch when they are not around;)
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This is a really good game it's got epic new stuff and I spend 3hours playing it so go TOKYO!!
1400067820|4.0|Certainly not for anyone wanting simple answers or solutions. For the information tansmitted it is done in an entertaining manner.
B008QLXSG8|3.0|This book is a classic, but you have to really want to read it... It was a good book, a nice amount of action. If you are just reading it for school, the book will not end well or interest you.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love this. While away on a trip, I saw a book in a store that I was anxious to read, but it was just out, in hard cover, and I knew I wasn't going to carry it home on the plane. So.....I had my Android tablet with me, I downloaded the Kindle app and then the book, and also saved money because the store price was, understandably, quite a lot more. I was so happy to be able to start my read! And, when I turn my tablet on, it automatically goes right to the page I stopped on.  Love it!!
B00CVCG87O|4.0|I came upon TesseracT a year ago with their CD &#34;One&#34;.  I was immediately impressed with their atmospheric melodies, and complex time signatures.  This new release is little different.  The music is phenomenal!  The time-signatures are so tightly wound, it would suffocate you if not for the ethereal Dead Can Dance-styled guitar melodies.  The new vocalist has a noticeably different style, but is no less brilliant and poetic.<br /><br />Each song seems to build upon the previous one, which can frustrate a fair-weather listener.  However, listening to it as a whole, it is easy to space out until the last song - without realizing the first one had ended - with a feeling of great satisfaction.<br /><br />I would give it 5 stars, but I'm very picky.  At 4 stars, I would still rate it as one of the best releases of the year so far.<br /><br />Standout tracks: Of Matter (Retrospect), Of Energy (Singularity), and Of Energy (Embers).
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|It was a good read. good character development allowed you to relate to the protagonists/antagonists. Hope the series isn't over - I'd like to read more.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|its the best because it does not take as long to load freinds and to look at or take picture's.
B00005JNS0|5.0|Good price!!!  I wanted cars one and it was ver hard to fine! So excited to be able to find it without cars 2,
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|one of greatest batman movies eva made the truth most def it a great movie classic always dark knight perfect
B003IEJZUG|4.0|By now you've probably seen the movie.  This is one of those books that I think everyone should read.  Like &#34;The Alchemest&#34; or &#34;Way of the Peaceful Warrior&#34; It's just a fantastic epic with deep, life enriching messages throughout.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|I cannot say enough good things about Big Bang Theory. Sheldon is my favorite . And each season gets better! Love the addition of the female counterparts. This is one show I make sure not to miss each week.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This book is one of the most compelling, original and moving examples of great SciFi there is.  It is dark and even disturbing at times but so so good.
B00C1BU7V8|2.0|This was a boring movie. Very dark and gloomy movie. I would not recommend this movie to watch unless it was free
B009AMANH4|5.0|Great film.  I'm a fan of historical duco-dramas so I may be suffering from the target audience syndrome but I don't care.  This is a well told story with incredible acting, music, special effects, writing... everything about it simply glows.  Highly, highly recommend.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I am new to the Kindle Fire world. My adult children are teaching me. My grandson and I can play Nemo together or I play it on my own it can be quite addicting but a great way to be entertained and pass the time. It is easily navigated by a 4 year old but offers sequential thinking problems for him to work through. The graphics are amazing.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I don't usually gravitate toward books where mental illness is a central theme but this book was the exception.  Very well written, as someone who lives in Collingswood, NJ I was also intrigued and proud to see my community so well represented.  Good movie, great book.
B004X6PRO6|4.0|If North Korea is like the North Korea described in the book, it is truly a disturbing and disheartening place.  It is one of those books that has one thinking about the story long after the final page is turned.
B003H4I4JU|4.0|I loved Enders Game.  In fact Love doesn't quite go far enough to describe my feelings around that book.  This is the sequel of that 5 book series.  It's very good and very well written as is anything from Mr Card, but I was in the mood to keep reading Ender's and it took a while for me to relax into the new direction this book takes.  That said, I would certainly recommend it as well as the other four books of the Ender Quintet.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Its fun. When you are bored and stuff I'm just putting this extra stuff so I can post this to the rate thingummy.
B00555X8OA|3.0|To be fair, I'm not a big non-fiction reader.  The information is very compelling and if I was more into non-fiction I'd give it more stars, but that style of writing is usually not able to keep my attention for long. Very cool concepts though about how we form opinions and biases and how those effect decision making that we would otherwise think was completely logical/sound.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|this game is the best u have to try it and it might start off hard but u will get use to it trusts me #b_R3A1_100%
B0054JZC6E|4.0|fun games to figure out and can get addictive.  have a blast playing them. like to play with family and friends
B008IJTFYW|4.0|The number of noise choices available is nice. I haven't tried it for sleep yet but the noises are relaxing. Plan to try it when traveling.
B001JIFYSA|4.0|A very well done feel good movie.  Well-cast.  Interestingly done to tie characters ordinary, but full-of-drama, lives.  I would watch it again......and again.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|I just absolutely loved this game since it was a challenge to me and I love challenges. I recommend it to anybody who is looking for a challenge
B00BWRKVVS|2.0|For many Disney fans, The Emperor's New Groove is the pinnacle of comedy in the Disney animated film library (myself included). The film works on so many levels and it's impossible not to be charmed by its charisma and superb cast. When Disney announced a Blu-ray release of the film with Kronk's New Groove included, I could hardly contain myself from preordering it. Releasing on the same day as the [[ASIN:B00BY6XM5E Lilo & Stitch / Lilo & Stitch: Stitch Has A Glitch Two-Movie Collection]], my Blu-ray player was about to receive some much-needed love from my two favorite Disney films! No longer would I have to hunt for [[ASIN:B00003CXQY The Ultimate Groove (Collector's Edition)]]. Disney could easily include the two films in high definition and also use the remaining space to stuff all the extras it could for the film!<br /><br />Or so I thought.<br /><br />As stunning as the transfer is on this Blu-ray release, it is completely lacking -ANY- bonus features. That's right, all the glorious extras from [[ASIN:B00003CXQY The Ultimate Groove Edition]] are completely missing. In fact, Kronk's New Groove is toted on the back of the box as THE special feature, \\"with more fun, laughter and adventure for the entire family\\". Yes, Kronk's New Groove is hilarious and a great follow-up to the main film, but a bonus feature (film) should NOT be considered THE bonus feature. Disney should have held out on both this release and the [[ASIN:B00BY6XM5E Lilo & Stitch Two-Movie Collection]] in favor of appropriate Diamond Editions if they're going to treat these releases even worse than [[ASIN:B007KUFDB4 Home on the Range]], which actually kept its bonus features when it made the Blu-ray transition.<br /><br />Again, the video and audio quality on this release is STUNNING on both The Emperor's New Groove and Kronk's New Groove, but if Disney is going to cheap out again you might want to hold off on this release and wait for the inevitable 3D Kuzcotopia Anniversary Edition.<br /><br />If you must purchase this release, at least swap this release's bare-bones DVD disks with those of [[ASIN:B00003CXQY The Ultimate Groove (Collector's Edition)]].<br /><br />Or better yet, just keep that version. The picture and audio quality already rival the Blu-ray's transfer.<br /><br />As I mentioned earlier, [[ASIN:B00BY6XM5E Lilo & Stitch / Lilo & Stitch: Stitch Has A Glitch Two-Movie Collection]] has unfortunately fallen into the same situation. Consumers will not appreciate Disney's recent trend of releasing classic films with ZERO bonus features. If you are a true Disney enthusiast, please send Disney a message by holding off on this release until it gets a proper treatment.you must purchase this release, at least swap this release's bare-bones DVD disks with those of [[ASIN:B00003CXQY The Ultimate Groove (Collector's Edition)]].<br /><br />Or better yet, just keep that version.

B001LOU8ME|5.0|This really blew me away. Absolutely incredible show from start to finish!! I felt the remastering was excellent as well contrary to some other reviews. This sounds fantastic!!! A must own for any UFO-MSG fan.
0618680004|4.0|Overall an excellent argument for the development of secular morality. Indoctrination of children into their parents' religion is abuse and these kids are growing up to be proud Tea Party members here in the US. Higgs-Boson, save  us!
B005IML464|5.0|This is a good copy to collect the complete set of Beethoven Symphonies!  This set is much better than the 1980's digital recording!
B00499NHLC|5.0|It is always hard to re-do a classic especially when your attempting to bring classic characters into the twenty first century. Sherlock succeeds in all aspects. It is a role attempted by many and grasped by few. Cumberbatch joins the few who really grasp the Baker Street sleuth's persona.
B001KWP54S|4.0|Classic Blues With Nostalgic Voices. Worried Life Blues & 10 Long Years Are Excellent. Recommended For All Who Like Both These Guys, Together They Are Great.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Was pleasantly surprised at the good flow of the movie story line in conjunction with the book. The gritty nature of the filming gave validity to the real nature of the times and made the story that much more compelling. Looking forward to the rest of the episodes in season 1.
B00CW665VI|5.0|I bought this book yesterday and finished it this morning. I couldn't put it down because it that that good. The way the story was written and how it's told from the lips of Drew Evans to me/you (his reader), was absolutely brilliant what Emma Chase did. He's arrogant and funny and you'll want to just keep reading till you get to the very end of his story. It's a MUST read and you will not be disappointed!
B00CFQN12Q|3.0|The special effects were as advertised, but the story was weak to the extreme. The movie was more for the action junkie than for the thoughtful viewer. I hope for the sake of Mr. Willis' career that he graciously turns down any producer that wants to do another installment.
B001P5M7QE|5.0|Amazing if the Python crew is your kind of humor.  Saw this movie when I was in middle school and it opened me up to a world of British comedy that perhaps I wouldn't have known otherwise.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This was a rollercoaster ride. I loved every minute of it. I honestly couldn't put it down. I haven't read a book I would recommend to another in a long time.... I definitely recommend this one.
B000PC0U1W|5.0|Excellent movie with great character actors and top notch dialogue.  If you like dramatic and thought provoking movies with a great hero / anti-hero main character, you will like this movie.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I should be ashamed to admit it, but I watched the entire second season in one day.  I just couldn't get enough of it.  The story line, the costumes and the characters are all top-notch!
B0015AARJI|5.0|100% Original not Fake, recommended for everyone. It works likes a charm, just plug, play and charge and thats it.
B006WPWH4E|5.0|Perfect for those interminable plane, train and automobile (passenger) trips. It's one of the few apps I have found for my Kindle that, once it's loaded, does not require an active internet connection.
B0072NWJRK|5.0|Excellent mystery.  Very well written.  Couldn't put it down.  Will look into author's other writings.  I wish all mysteries were on this level.
B00BVYNSLC|5.0|Intriguing and full of twists in every episode. Can't wait for each new episode. Tatiana Maslany is amazing and fantastic as several characters.
B002VPE1WK|4.0|It does what it is suppose to.  Protect the camera and lenses.  It may be a little too large for some people.
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|I love this app. It takes pictures just like regular digital camera I love it.<br />The on this app is also very good.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|I remember that when I started this book I was thinking &#34;It's fine, but it's not awesome.&#34; But shortly thereafter, I couldn't put it down! It was intelligently written with a wide vocabulary and flowing sentences...I haven't read a book so well written in a very long time. The storyline had many facets and mysteries, several of which I still don't think I've quite figured out. I was sad to have finished the book and although I've been on a serious reading binge for a couple of months now, I find I have no inclination to move on from this book any time soon. It just seems like any book after Blood Song will be unable to measure up.
B000FC1RCI|4.0|Thought I had read all of Agatha Christie's novels but missed this one somehow. They made a movie from the books idea and called it Ten Little Indians and changed the story a bit.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Loved this book and was sad when it was done. Just downloaded Dark Places and hoping for another great read!
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|a little long and drawn out.  but good overall.  if they were from spain, why did it sound like they were from the UK?
B007HU4FJ8|5.0|I know that Mel Gibson only added subtitles as an afterthought, the movie stands alone even though there is not 1 word of any language spoken today on earth.<br />the acting and directing of this movie places you directly into the story line of Jesus Christ and his crucifixion.<br />stirs my faith every time I watch, and it gets better every time.
B0054SMID0|5.0|This movie is do good.  I have watched it 3 times! Twists and turns you don't expect, right up to the end.
B00BMVTS1S|3.0|The Hobbit is one of my all time favorite books. I looked forward to watching this movie for a long time, especially after watching the Lord of the Rings.<br />While the story line appears to be in line with the book - some of the special effects are really 2nd rate.<br />and I cant believe you have to watch The Hobbit in 2 films.<br />I will watch the 2nd installment, but I was left with a bad taste after the first.
B00BHHIWQO|2.0|I'm new to Kindle games but I couldn't find a way to exit game so I wont be playing it
B001QJUX24|5.0|John Wayne's best work, although you will have to get past some of the negative references to Native American's, you have to remember that this is A MOVIE. Wayne gives it his all, in this stirring performance of love, perseverance and hope.
B00BJ9VBLI|3.0|Game is okay for a match three. I played this app, but couldn't figure the power-ups out. No real directions. Deleted the app in the end.
B0067TGSOK|4.0|Guillebeau provides a lot of inspiration in his book $100 Startup. the book is easy to read, and offers numerous examples of others who have taken the leap to get out on their own and start a business. some of the business are lifestyle businesses, others have become more significant.<br />this is not about big business though - it is more about freedom, while making enough money to live.<br />especially good if you want to become a blogger, or small local retail business.<br /><br />While details are not provided (step-by-step), there are a lot of useful checklists, and high level guidance tools within the book.<br />Guillebeau also provides a lot of resources (some free, others for fee) on his website, that provide a lot more details on how to get started.<br /><br />really enjoyed - now just need to get started!
B006XF5BTG|5.0|Michael provides invaluable information gathered from numerous scientific studies in a clear concise plan for body transformation. This book will give you the information and the plan that you need to understand how to build a great body. Now you just have to get off the couch and do it!
B00AS1Q8FW|5.0|Can not say enough about the Lee Child book series &#34;Jack Reacher&#34; One of the very best out there in the real world.
B006LSZECO|4.0|A gazillion reviews already have been posted about GONE GIRL, so I'll simply mention a few points.<br /><br />--  It's GREAT to find a plot line that, right about mid-way through the book, sends you for an unexpected (and thus highly satisfying) loop-dee-loop. And, it appears that the majority of the reviewers here had that same &#34;WHOA-HO!&#34; response to that plot surprise.<br /><br />--  Appreciably fewer people were taken by the ending. True, some like the book's conclusion, too. But, the fact that the majority of reviewers liked the mid-plot twist, while far fewer found the ending as satisfying, says something.<br /><br />--  First, &#34;good on, ya, Ms. Flynn, for the first half, including that mid-passage plot whammy . . . but second -- for those of us decidedly unsatisfied by the ending -- we wish you'd (somehow, some way), been able to create an equally surprising-and-satisfying conclusion.<br /><br />HOWEVER, the absence of the latter didn't (for me) negate the satisfying quirks, duplicity, and &#34;made-for-each-other&#34; aspects of the 2 lead characters throughout most of this compelling story.  So, I nonetheless rank it a 3.5 to 4 stars . . . when compared to the many other &#34;mystery&#34; books I've read this year.
B00BCOQSSQ|4.0|Owen has just started college alongside his best friends Anika and Dante. He's a typical boy with the typical issues, but that all changes once Owen finds himself immersed in another world - Everville. Owen discovers that the balance between good and evil is out of whack in Everville. If something isn't done, life in both Everville and Owen's real world will be doomed...<br /><br />Roy Huff uses a very rare writing style. The closest similarity I can come up with is Tolkien. Roy immerses you into the world of Everville. In some areas Roy leaves a lot to the imagination, but in others he uses vivid imagery. He never spends an overly significant amount of time on one thing, but there were a few times I got lost in the descriptions.<br /><br />While the book was written for young adults, I'd say that mature middle schoolers would enjoy it. I enjoy reading novels aloud to my kids, and I think this would be good for that. My boys would probably like it but wish that there was just a little more action. There are some places where you have to piece some things together that may be difficult for some middle schoolers reading alone.<br /><br />Where the book fell short for me was with the characters. I love to connect to the characters I read about, but Huff focuses a lot more on the plot and descriptions. There wasn't anything that made it personal to me. I think stronger characters would have made me jump from enjoying it to loving it. Without the connection to any characters, sometimes I found it hard to read. It isn't one of those books that you can read while half asleep. You really need to be fully awake to follow it.<br /><br />On the plus side, I really enjoyed the good vs evil theme, and Owen holding firm through some tough decisions between right and wrong. There was also a battle scene that I felt completely drawn into as if I was there. I really came away thinking Huff must have one heck of an imagination, and it's incredible how he weaved the story together sowell.<br /><br />I'll have to rate this a low 4 stars. Overall I felt it was really lacking with the characters, but I felt the world-building was INCREDIBLE!!<br />*I received a copy from the author in exchange for an honest review.*
B003U51D58|5.0|I love all of the Lost seasons, you don't know what to expect next, you seriously have to pay attention to really understand.
B00CL6HGIK|3.0|The one big surprise in this movie was who is corrupt and what did they do...once that was revealed...the remainder of the movie was about Hollywood-style predictable chase and fight scenes. I could have written a more exciting ending myself. What a waste of wonderful talent such as Mark Wahlberg & Russel Crowe. I was left wondering where is the master carver who failed to complete these wooden characters?
B00B31DT5I|5.0|I like relaxing to good music and Michael Bolton is one of my favorites. I have many of his albums.
B00COGZ8FU|3.0|Weird premise. This movie had some high points, but overall, it was standard matinee fare. Not good. Not bad. Certainly not great. Maybe somebody's get rich quick scheme was to cast Tom Cruise in an action film and expect him to roll in the box office cash. But Tom wasn't gritty, or seasoned - he just wasn't Jack Reacher. Tom, please stop telling the makeup man to perfect your skin and place only artful fake scars on your body.
B000FC0SIM|5.0|I am a writer, slowly coming out from under my disguise as an accountant, and love this book for it's inspiration and because Mr. King doesn't take himself so seriously that he can't help those of us new to the craft.
B00BHNQ5XK|4.0|Ethan Hawke simply never fails to bring it...into your home...a little something to disturb your dreams. Watch this film alone tonight if you don't want to sleep too soundly.
B008393Q2O|3.0|This app is good for just making notes/lists. Wish you could arrange notes the way you wanted instead of based on what you opened last.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Thought the father was not very smart in the beginning and through the book.  Have recommend to friends. Good book
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game to me is like a 3d mobile Sonic the Hedgehog game. The boost helps out a lot! AWESOMENESS!!!!!!!!!!!!
B007SGLZP8|1.0|So unworthy of remembering.  I started it but never finished it.  Would not recommend it to friends or my enemies
B000SEHJGQ|1.0|I had no interest at all.  The subject matter bored me, and I didn't think it was well written.  Just my opinion.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Many turns some believable other not.  Read it for both of my book clubs and some were really into it.  The other club did not like it at all
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I love this app because the lovely sounds really do help me to sleep better, I have a hard time with background noise keeping me awake and this HELPS!
B007EC27QM|3.0|This App does what it is supposed to do.  There is nothing special about it but it always handy when I need to get some numbers together.
B00C7KXUOE|5.0|This show is a breath of fresh air. The show keeps you on the edge of your seat and takes you on a journey through madness.
B001U3Y5XE|5.0|This game challenges my grandson's creativity and taps into his huge interest in Legos.  Lots of fun while still being a learning activity.
B00CATSONE|5.0|Read the review and thought it would be an interesting read. Was a little disappointed that it was so short, but it is a very good read.
B007SGM084|5.0|Excellent book. Very entertaining. Kept my interest throughout the whole trilogy. Would like to see a continuance of this story line.
B00942S4OY|5.0|My 10 year old niece loves this CD, I liked the price so that means mission accomplished even though I ended up buying her the wrong CD.
B00AYJCEVK|5.0|Absolutely AWESOME!!!!  This is an awesome cd to worship with. It is excellent music, it really lifts up the name of Jesus throughout the WHOLE CD!!! Great music. It came with a dvd also. That is cool as well. Great worship tool.
B000ICKPOQ|5.0|Stargate Atlantis is the best spinoff of the Stargate franchise. I definitely enjoyed it more than SG1.  I love all the characters including those annoying villains.
B006RXQ3GO|5.0|I enjoyed this movie a lot because as a child is was a risky adventure trying to watch it without the parents knowing!  This movie represents risky behavior and great decisions!
1449433251|5.0|A must have for Calvin and Hobbes fans. The book,page and print quality is very good. Glad to have it in my collection.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game maybe 6.99 but trust me it is worth it and it may not have the best graphics but it is fun. I own the computer edition and the Xbox 360 edition and is really fun. And it is the most popular indie game and the person that made it his name is notch persons.
B00A8ECU24|1.0|This game is great, I like playing it on my phone and its very cute and well made but to buy extra gems and coins is just out of this world OVER PRICED!!! Shame on you gameloft I'd rather buy the game for my phone then have you make it so I cant finish the game because I refuse to spend $250 dollars. You made a great game and I think you should get some money but what your asking is just WRONG WRONG WRONG!!!
0439023513|5.0|The HUNGER GAMES is not that good because it has my name in it my name is octavia why would you put my name in it that is all I have to say thank you
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I think that this game is an amazing one,because it tells the story after the movie. That is why I love this game so much.<br />(My favorite movie is Finding Nemo) :-)
B006MPKDD6|5.0|I thought that this was one of Michael's best. As always it flowed well and was difficult to put down. I would recommend it to al readers of this genre
B005GFPZYK|5.0|If I could give this book more stars, I would. This recounting of an amazing life experience and tales of engaging the enemy are brought to life in a very vivid way. The way this story is retold is so well done, you can't just can't bring yourself to put it down. I particularly liked not only how the book felt like he was talking to you in his living room, but also how he would tell about how his experiences also affected his home life and his difficulties there, while also letting her tell her side of it as well. It was very eye opening.
B005SDMDRW|5.0|fast moving, good read, I immersed myself in it. I would highly recommend it to other readers of the same genre
B00CBKXGPI|1.0|Nothing like I thought it would b..comparedto dark arcana and deep so disappointing. Would not recommend to any hog lover
B003G4W49C|5.0|A journey to the future where the earth is over populated and birth control is tightly controlled.  Except for the Wiggins family who have a third child...the end.  Or Ender.  Plots within plots, children becoming soldiers, fear of other sentient beings...the paranoia just grows and grows and grows.  Not a quick read, but a satisfying read.  For serious science fiction fans, worth the time to ponder.
B009NY43NY|1.0|This was just an awful end to a great series.  Yes the last few books were not that good. Don' t waste your time.
B003H4I4JU|5.0|Ender grows up...lives 3,000 years, theory of relativity, other sentient beings, another world.  A realistic (?) look at travels between planets...leave one planet and it takes 25 or 30 years to reach your destination.  Enjoyed the &#34;piggie&#34; population, and the idea of symbiosis between species. Intelligent trees...snakes into grass,  mr. card has an interesting mind.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Downton Abbey would not be complete without this DVD, and adding each new season is an absolute must for Downton fans!!  Pick a day, time and watch an entire season at your leisure.  Leaves you wanting more!  Would recommend to friends
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Very well written. Very interesting. Made me think a lot about how I would have acted in a similar situation.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|There are so many important truths voiced in this book.  Not every observation hit home for me, but overall it was informative, eye-opening and supremely cathartic.  Having read the book, I am inspired to make changes for myself, and for all the women I work with now and will work with in the future.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It's not as good as pc or Xbox 360 version but if you want minecraft on the go<br />it is awesome and you can build whatever you want
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|I love listening to Andrea Bocelli! I am always so amazed how he gets around on stage. I also bought this for my friend who also loves Andrea Bocelli.
B005LAIIJY|5.0|Great dvd. We have watched it several times already. It shows a lot of what slavery was actually like. Which really helps people understand. Reading about it and hearing about it is one thing, but seeing it for yourself is another and that's what a lot of people need is to see it for themselves to understand.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Super fun and addicting!!!!! More coins and upgrades,  please! Whole family of eight plays and can't get enough. More, more, more!
B00CKQ1092|5.0|Despite the line-up changes Dillinger always sounds like Dillinger. Instead of stagnating in obscurity with their punk energy and signature sonic heft, Dillinger has showcased since the earliest part of this millenium that they can and will make beautiful, poppy sounds that will stick in your head. Of course, it's Dillinger's version of these things. This album is an excellent step forward for a band that everyone should listen to. Only if they want music that is challenging and requires and active, and engaged audience.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|You can say that the Romans would like this book better but i am Greek and im proud!!!!!<br /> I do have an adictition to all Percy Jackson books but i actully like Jason better than Percy!!!!
B004UID2LC|5.0|It works really well, it's fast and there wasn't any glitches! You can download any YouTube video to your device to watch at a later time when you don't have internet access.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I watched the movie before I read the book, but the book transformed into a whole different story. A better story. I'm going to read Catching Fire, and Mocking Jay. My friend Karlie wants me to so bad. Now I know why.
B00821PCJS|5.0|good acting, great production values and a swirling plot make this alien invasion series the best of the genre so far.
B00AGDW8II|1.0|Movie just stunk! Bad story. No meaning.ban it!<br />Very dull and uninteresting. Dont bother to see it.<br />Take a bath!
B00CWVG1Z8|4.0|I enjoyed the movie. The actors played their parts well. Down fall of this movie as most movies who try to convert book into movie it moves too fast not truly explaining anything so the viewer feels lost. I did not read the book until after I saw the movie and this is how I felt. I gave it four stars simply because it was still a good movie to watch, just don't hold your breath if you want it to be exactly like the book.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I just downloaded this game on my new Kindle Fire (which I love by the way) and it is a fun way to pass the time. The graphics are so bright and clear. My granddaughter was surprised that you can actually play solitaire with playing cards. I like the electronic way better.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|I had heard about this show  and started streaming it on Amazon, and was pleasantly surprised to find out how great it is--gritty characters, great  stories--better than most shows on the big networks & prime cable.  Don't miss it!
1400032717|4.0|fun easy read, hilarious perspective. The main character does ramble alot though and can get tiring but overall its very interesting
B00447L4JG|5.0|We love this film!! Best movie ever!! Finally, we own a copy for our home library!! Love Love LOVE!! Long live the Pumpkin King!!
B002SSUQFG|4.0|I really like my Seiko automatic watch. No batteries to replace plus it's an accurate time piece. The only negative aspect is the size, 37mm. Compared to my other watches it is somewhat small but looking at the watch now while wearing it, it doesn't appear to be too small. I like the pewter colored metal case and matching clasp. The canvas band is nice, also. Overall, for the price, you can't go wrong.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Nelson DeMille is one of my favorite authors.  I especially love the dry wit of his major character, John Corey.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|it is simple &amp; easy to use,  I love it ! some have so many buttons you don't know what to do with them.good work digitalchemy.LLC
B002NEFL8W|5.0|If you shoot videos and you will want this unit. Plus, it doesn't add all that much weight and will last all day!
B004WGIXX4|5.0|Awesome movie. For a movie watcher, it is a must. I recommend it for a date night to anyone in or kicking off a relationship.
B00B6QXN56|5.0|Joe Bonamassa is a virtuoso when it comes to playing guitar. His using accoustic guitars for this particular show proves just how good he really is. I can see why he has been successful in the music world since he was 12. The DVD ain't bad either!!! Besides Bonamassa, the album contains other very seriously talented muscians accompanying.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I love how you can either plug it in an outlet or plug it in a USB port. Very convenient!
1594488843|5.0|Daniel Pink wright, about leadership in about motivation in a very business mindset however this book was amazing. I was skeptical at first however after reading it I was blown away by some of the simple concepts that come to fruition regarding how we are motivated and how we should and should not motivate others. I actually think this book would be helpful in many settings for business offices and in education lendingto change the ways in which we choose to perform on a daily basis. I definitely recommend this book. Its a quick and simple read yet it challenges our idea of intrinsic reward and motivation.
B009NY43NY|1.0|This book was horrible! I felt like she rushed it. Sookies love life used to be the main focus of the book. I'm not sure why charlaine has gone so G rated. I cannot believe she ended the book the way she did.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|This game blew me away. It opens up your mind to the amazing world of your imagination. You can create things from a giant happy chocolate hippogriff to a tiny angry hungry santa clause. It is just so amazing how almost everything you can think of is in this game. There is also a freeplay so you can open up your mind without the levels in your way. I absolutly love this app.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Could not put this book down kept me engaged throughout! Only thing that stopped me from reading this in one day was the battery on my kindle dying!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I've read several books on this subject but this is the first I've read written by a man of science.  How refreshing and uplifting to know there's a doctor out there who has experienced this great gift and can understand and actually believe patients who have experienced it too.  Although his descriptions of orbs and the Earthworm's -Eyeview are something I've not read about in previous books this story does reinforce my belief of a great God in control of all but also allowing us to make choices and find our own way to Him.  I did not want the book to end as I couldn't put it down. Thank you Dr. Alexander for sharing your story of the greatest love of all.
B003PTP4S6|5.0|I haven't acquainted myself well enough with this CD to know which cut I'm listening to, as I just popped it in the CD player in my car and let it play, but every piece is beautiful, soothing, or lively, or engaging in some way. I just love it.
B004ZZS4CC|3.0|The true story of Jaycee's abduction and grim life there after is an eye opener yet after several chapters I felt I had had enough if the sordid details. I almost felt like a voyeur after that point. It did answer questions that had been brought up, as how he was able to control her mind set so she didn't try to escape, but a lot of the information makes you squirm. She went through a hell on earth,  but reading these very personal moments made me feel like I didn't need to \\"be there\\" as much as I felt I was. I felt like having her put it in writing as it was, she was being victimized again.
B008220DIC|1.0|The actors could have ad-libbed most of their lines and no one would be any the wiser. The script writers must have been high on something. Freddie drinks Lysol and camly walks away like nothing happens and that had no consequences. The all wise Master asks Freddie to concoct a weird brew for him and gets high on it. All throughout the move absolutely anything happens and the audience is supposed to make sense of it. It adds up to nonsense.[[ASIN:B00BLGXL3U The Master]]
B00CXX8KTA|5.0|Fantastic classic rock.  Great sound.  Some songs sound like Thin Lizzy and some have a unique sound.  The more I listen to it, the more I like it!
1452110581|5.0|Given as a gift.  Greatly enjoyed.<br />If you personify your cats this is a great collection.<br />Mostly blank verse.<br />I could just Pee on This.
B00COHAUD4|4.0|I really enjoyed the movie. I'm not a huge fan of horror films, it's just not my thing (typically), but I liked this movie a lot. I would venture to say if you were a fan or horror/thriller movies you would likely rate this a 5 star movie. One of the things I really enjoyed about it is that it's not a horror movie in the \\"gore\\" sense of the word. This is a supsense/thriller style supernatural horror flick. It has its fair share of \\"shockers\\" and \\"jump from your seat\\" moments. The story line is very entertaining and original (I've never seen a story along these lines).<br /><br />Bottom line: Very good movie. If you are a fan of horror/thriller you would probably absolutely love it.
B0012GMYTG|5.0|I had forgotten about &#34;Hey Stoopid&#34;.  Just recently heard the song and immediately ordered the CD.  I love it.  The new generation of kids probably won't care for it.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|One of the best shows I've ever watched. I love every season of the Walking Dead. It's a fantastic show and story line in the zombie apocalypse, horror sub genre. The interesting thing is that I'm not even typically a fan of horror films/shows but I really love this one (though I do tend to favor the zombie apocalypse sub-genre as it relates to the broader horror genre).<br /><br />Bottom line: If you are a fan of zombie films you absolutely have to and must see every single episode of this show...it would be a crime if you did not.
B004LROUNG|4.0|Took a while to get into it, but ended nicely.<br />Would have liked more interaction with the character of Miss Rochelle.
B008JH5HCW|4.0|I thought it was a very decent movie and I certainly enjoyed the hour and a half or so. It's not your typical big budget, big name, A-lister, Hollywood movie but it was still an entertaining show if you like futuristic style action movies. Guy Pearce has quite a few one-liner jokes and quips throughout the movie and I thought I would end up finding it cheesy but it actually fit very well with the portrayal of his character. Maggie Grace (from Taken/Taken 2) does a nice job as well.<br /><br />Bottom line: Is it the best movie ever? No. Is it an entertaining action movie in the [plausibly] near future that delivers on what it promises? Yes absolutely. If you like action movies and near-future environments then you will most likely be entertained by this movie.
B005NPBT5M|5.0|I love Pink Floyd and this was to replace the CD that got lost in my move. Even my kids like it.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Really good game I'm constantly playing it and love the challenges it gives you. Never really a fan of these games but this one beats the rest.<br />..
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I'm so happy this game is finally on fire i payed this game so much on my phone glad it's finally on the fire
B0050R0XEG|5.0|I am not a Lego fanatic but I love the thought of these old VWs --- great model, fun to assemble and I love looking at it. Great replacement until I buy my own camper van.
B001PJRAUS|4.0|Can anyone tell me WHY they cut out a scene on the DVD? Why don't we get to see Amanda singing?<br /><br />Still love the movie though :)
B000RF7XYO|5.0|I saw this in the theater when it came out & Loved it! Although sad in it's message a wonderful acting job on all sides!
B00AKFG15S|4.0|Archer is a great story teller. His insight into the British political system is well documented. The story of th Clifton Family is very true to life of many families. A good relaxed enjoyable read
0800141660|5.0|Sigh, sigh, sigh!  great movie with the usual good actors associated with this type of film. Great to watch on a rainy day
B008YKGQR4|1.0|The second I opened up this app it had an eternal error and closed. It won't even work. Disappointing at best.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|It's nearly 1:00 in the morning and so disappointed this beautiful book has come to an end.  I read the first two and loved them both...this one did not disappoint. Please do not stop writing; i look forward to more books of this caliber. Not only a literary gem,but one that touches my heart in so many places.  A thousand tragedies redeemed by profound relationships.
B00C4XYEBW|5.0|This release is by far the Best out of all the live JP dvd's out to date. Priest takes us on a 40 year metal trip with not one but at least two tracks of each album.if you ever been asked the question of Priest OR Maiden this dvd will clearly answer that question for you .Rob still has the chops to let out screams.Glen is a genius on guitar .Ian still pounds away deaf defying bass tones.Scott is a thunderous god on drums and this new kid Richie is a Beast on lead guitar taking over where K.K left but I swear this kid doesnt even strum on his guitar & these amazing sounds still screech out. dvd comes in a cd jewel case rather than your usual dvd case which makes it much cooler the insert includes awesome photos in a 12 page full color booklet . A must have for all PRIEST fans.for tracklist check despription. You wont regret it.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This book captivated me from the very beginning. The author developed the characters in a way that you really knew them.There were little events in the book that made you smile and then cry.What a treasure !
B00C4U9U4Q|5.0|I sampled through this album just looking for something a bit different than what I had been listening to. I wasn't disappointed. On the whole it was a fairly solid album and have given it more than a few spins front to back over the last few weeks.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Yup dis stuff is da best. If y'all don't like dis stuff y'all be tripping. Real life problems in this movie. Loved it
B0031RS7EK|3.0|Good, tense thriller, can be a little tedious at times but keeps you hooked. Nick Stone is an engaging tough guy character who uses his SAS skills to track down some seriously brutal killers .
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I get so hooked on the DA inner sanctum. Love everything about it, the scenery, the actors, the costumes, the plot. So good to watch.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|VERY hard to watch at times, but INCREDIBLE.  So well made.  So heart breaking.  So touching.  I see life differently now.
B00C1BUYX4|4.0|The strategizing etc. in this movie got a bit tedious (I know, it was a VERY important subject!) but DD Lewis made me forget that I was watching an actor. Made me feel like I saw a little bit of Mr. Lincoln's life that I had not imagined.
B00735HGQ6|5.0|I loved the fact that Harold's news about Queenie distracted him to the point that he walked right out of his life!  He began to experience kindness from the many strangers he met along the way, and opened himself up to learning about them, as well.  Harold learned that, &#34;It was a much of a gift to receive as it was to give, requiring as it did both courage and humility.&#34;  Harold became brave during his walk, and faced his failures, persevered through days when his body hurt too much to continue.  Once Harold realized that he needed people, he could not just abandoned his  little entourage.  This was his atonement for letting down Queenie, his wife Maureen and his son, David.  Through his journey Harold went through a transformation.  &#34;Beginnings could happen more than once, or in different ways.  You could think you were starting something fresh, when actually what you were doing was carrying on as before.&#34; Harold could no longer be apathetic, he was engaged in his world, and that engagement made him less ordinary.  The strangers he met knew it, and eventually Maureen did too.  Harold's story allows us to recognize that we are all ordinary.  Famous or not, rich or poor,  man or woman, we each have stories of grief, suffering and loss, and in that commonality, we are a human family.
B00BP4W3WI|3.0|Just watched this for nostalgic reasons. Now that I'm older it seemed much sappier, but still an enjoyable afternoon watch.
B006RXQ1L6|4.0|Fun movie and love the music, not a big fan of Renee but enjoyed her in this movie and always love Queen Latifah.
B00CHILW64|3.0|Admirable effort to depict the horror of such an event. All of the actors did excellent work. Can't say I would watch it again, the subject being so hard to take.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I enjoyed this novel mostly because there were so many twists to the story. It was unpredictable and I had a lot to talk about in my book club. Highly recommend it.
B00BF11UM0|3.0|I don't know why this movie was a letdown to me, but I did watch it twice. The second time I fast forwarded through the initial torture scenes.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This novel is absolutely engrossing. It paints vividly the spiritual nature of family relationships that affect our lives from our  birth to our death. It illustrates how we all crave and need love, connection, acceptance and approval to feel secure and complete. This is a wonderful  book.
B00CRWJ7VC|1.0|Couldn't bear to watch more than about 25 minutes of it. How long were we supposed to wait until there was any cohesiveness to it?
B00AFROVQC|1.0|This book is poorly written.  The plot reminded me of &#34;The Sword in the Stone&#34;.  I have to confess I was able to struggle through only the first chapters.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Its sort of sad that eBay's application is better made and more fully featured than Amazon's built in store application on their Kindle device. I love this application and buy with confidence. Oh and PayPal is built in so no need to jump to the web browser.
B000YJ6736|4.0|The book is well written as I finished it within a few days. The characters are well developed as is the story. If you are looking for a happily ever after, this book is not it.
B000W04S6U|5.0|I love the full orchestra sound, instead of the MIDI. I especially love the track &#34;One Final Effort.&#34; I was afraid that Halo 3 would be mostly music from previous Halo soundtracks, and while there is some overlap, there is also new pieces, or new arrangements, that make this my favorite Halo soundtrack yet.  I actually have never played this game myself, but I love the music.
6305949980|5.0|I was stuck with the old vhs version of this and it was always getting fuzzy and the bulky vhs machine & vhs's were taking up too much space so I finally decided to get this.  It came in the cellophane so when I opened it it was in mint condition.  I wish I would've waited a day or 2 when the price dropped under $10.  But oh well...returning it and cancelling my whole order would've cost me more in the long run.  I don't know what's the special edition in this...I'm just glad to be able to watch the movie clearly now. :)
B008FPZQQU|4.0|my only gripe is the lack of &#34;tank&#34; in the 5.1 mix.  if any song calls out for 5.1, it's &#34;tank&#34;
B0026OR1UK|5.0|I am a coach and the information in this book is both inspiring and interesting to me and my students.<br />Coyle has done his homework and presents a clear path for what's necessary to really be great at something.<br />I would recommend it to anyone embarking on a new skill, sport or hobby. It will really help understand how to improve your skills with the talent you have!!
B008FPZQRO|5.0|stephen wilson takes my favorite ELP piece and made it a whole lot more perfect, bringing this epic a new life
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|Great game that teaches resource management with multi goal objectives. Play against other players, computer, friends and enemies.  Fun for the whole family.
B0097K21YW|5.0|I enjoy this game very much as it is very interesting and challenging.  If you like Cut the Rope and Angry Birds, this is a very easy game to enjoy.  It is also highly addictive!
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|It's fun one your learning curve flattens out. Beware of recklessly spending iso8. But other than that it's a great game for boredom avoidance
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|This starts off as a very fun game and slowly becomes your own masterpiece sea garden of coral, flora, and fauna.  Save your pearls for the rare plants and look up online tips for retaining visiting sea creatures.  The way that you place plants and coral together matter in this game.  You can always move items later to group them too.  You get rewards for grouping items in certain ways and it helps to find these tidbits of info online rather than pay for them using in game purchases.  Duh!
B003NTSBUG|5.0|I had never seen any of Leo's movies, so I did not know what to expect from him. He was awesome! All of the actors were great, but it is the writing that stands out in this story.  You will never see the ending coming! Definitely a must-see! And I will watch it again!
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I love Jewels, My husband even plays it on the ipad.  A good game to buy and enjoy with the family.
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|I wanted to see this movie because I have been a fan of Julianne Hough's since Dancing with the Stars. Wow! She is not only a great dancer, but a great actress! I loved this movie. It is a sweet romance, with a little suspense mixed in.  I would recommend this to everyone!
1476734941|5.0|Or so Michael Mosley says. I've only been doing the regime for a month and managed to lose about 2kg with very little hardship or drama.
B00CWVG1Z8|5.0|Wow! The graphics in this movie are awesome. I loved the characters, and I really want to read the books to know what's next. Great movie!
B006M4F67A|5.0|It's really fun and a great time passer but i play it just for the fun of it. Totally worth it
B004ZMWUCU|3.0|An interesting title...and as I read it, the ending was predictable.  Enjoyed the authors description of the main characters..great word pictures.
B00594XOZU|5.0|Really easy to use and fun too. But this is not a app that you could use to text people without this app.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Very fun and challenging. I would recommend this game to everyone. This game has a good story line also. Love it.
B00AZL3PBK|4.0|When I first got &quot;Leps World 2&quot; I was highly addicted but today... June 1st I got to World 3 - level 1. When I started, on the level, Lep was inside the brick wall and when the game started, lep fell down and died before the arrows -&gt; &lt;-  popped up like they usually do. I tried it over and over on my Kindle Fire but it did the same thing.<br />IT WOULD BE NICE IF THEY UPDATED AND FIXED THE GLITCH!!!!
B002ZG99TA|4.0|This is a good movie for the whole family to watch<br />it shows how some people really are at the work place<br />one for all and none for the rest it shows when you are over confident<br />what can really happen at the work place it has a little of everything in it me I Liked it and the story<br />was easy to keep up with real life situation that is this movie
B006NZDDCI|4.0|Every Cd would not play in my playstation for some reason. Other than that I was very pleased. The case is in good shape and good condition.
B0045HCJGC|4.0|westley snipes and sylvester it does not get any better than this<br />a lot of action from start to finish along with some comedy in it ,<br />you will laugh at some parts and just be in aw at other parts of the movie<br />its got alittle of everything in it its a movie for whole family if this is what<br />you are looking for
1455863866|4.0|I loved the way the cd's came in their case. Each cd was in good shape. The first container however had a broken loop which held the sleeves which hold the cd's. So I got my daughter to use her hot glue gun to repair the problem. Everything else in great working order. I would recommend. The speaker is great too.
B005LAII12|3.0|it starts slow but does get to the story of it ok not the best of mark whalberg  work he was better in four brothers
B005R32L66|5.0|Skype is about the best bargain anyone could ask for.  Skype to Skype is FREE and extremely inexpensive calling Skype to a landline.  I was paying T-Mobile $2.99 a minute from Israel to the US before I discovered Skype charged only 0.025 cents for the same amount of time.  A savings of 97 1/2%.
B002AT4K9G|5.0|of course I like all the fast and furious movies and this was just as good as others im waiting on # 6 to come out
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|This is a great game. I love it. I wish there was a save option so when you exit the game you can restart from the same level that you ended not from level one. Other than that no flaws.
B005S9ELVC|5.0|I ordered this DVD and it was just what they said in good working order and clean no skips at all i had it with in one week very fast process and I will buy from them again
B005544TRQ|5.0|We've been waiting for the show to come out on streaming. Can't wait for the second season! Suits is one of our favorite TV shows.
B002ZG999U|4.0|good movie lot of action and blowing up things<br />shows they get the job done and do it right<br />this is a real action movie for sure it is worth buying if you are into action
B002C6A6N6|5.0|I loved this series on TV now I can watch it everyday it's a good for family sessions and other occasions
B004EPYZQC|5.0|this is action from start to finish it keeps you in your seat and like the others as well I own the other four
B008J05EL8|1.0|Didn't meet expectations couldn't open it was a waste of my coins cannot recommend it surprised Kindle would offer it as an app
B0034G4OUO|5.0|Wayne Johnson played this one really good ,<br />  It is action from start to end will be watshing this film more than once
B00B2V66VS|5.0|The game is a fun pass time. It works better on a kindle/tablet then my cell phone. And the fact that its free and good quality made it better
B009MF5BXK|4.0|good movie lot of action and blowing up things<br />shows they get the job done and do it right<br />this is a real action movie for sure it is worth buying if you are into action<br />and this movie is full of it .
B00CWV8X04|2.0|really nothing to remember.  i can't think of anything good to say or bad for that matter.  just mediocre.  disappointing
B00BB67UNW|5.0|this is more like a mark whalburg movie that I was exspecting a good story and movie im loking forward to more like this
B004RJMUJO|5.0|great app. there is actually less ads and more blades now, and if you compare all the other apps and this one, it is a good deal. ps: add more power up banannas like a flame one that burns all fruit for 10 seconds.
B0063GORYU|4.0|I am new to Kindle. I enjoy games for pasttime.  This was my first pick as I have played it before.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Have always enjoyed the James Bond movies. We really like this movies with all the action, good story and good ending.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game but if you don't get it at first but once you get the hang of it you'll love it and you can build anything you want and its a good way to express what you want to make and I rate this 5 stars and I recommend this game for everyone 7and up so this game is definitely worth 7 dollars<br /><br />-niall lover
B00C7DGRL4|1.0|This looks like a great movie. Looks like just what I would have watched tonight. Fun, lots of action, fantasy-ish, nice looking storyline, decent reviews. And then you don't have an option for a rental, only purchase. Stupid. I did not watch this movie because I didn't want to pay $15 to stream something I will only watch once. Stupid. I would have paid up to $5 to rent it too - I really wanted to see it. Now I'm watching another movie.
B003NBFZTE|5.0|I was looking for something that would relieve my muscle pain after cycling. I put these on after my shower and sometimes wear them all day.  They work better than aspirin in relieving my muscle soreness after cycling.
B00B6QXN56|5.0|I have heard joe do this music before but to hear it done with just mic pick up and different back up members with acoustic instruments The sound is different but at the same time the same.Great.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|If, like me, you can't get enough of Tolkien, and if the fine details of of his world interest you as much as the broad story, then you ought to love the Hobbit (Unexpected Journey), which is a microscopic view of the unfolding first third of the tale. It's all done with an obsessive approach to every aspect of the story. Thus, character development is managed with care, but so too are matters like the design of mugs and the hemming on Bilbo's Bermuda sorts. It's all realer-than-real. And that's not a joke. Super high-def technology provides sceen views that work differently from normal human vision. In the real world, we focus with incredible sharpness on a center of interest, and the rest of the visual field is not resolved to that extent; things come into sharpest focus when we look at them. But in the Blu-Ray screen view, the whole wide screen is sharp, and while this is great on the second or eleventh view, because there are always new things to discover, for people who do lots of visual work, the first viewing is freaking weird, antiseptic, and far, far from believable. I don't recommend doing it, because it nearly ruins the movie, but it becomes easy to see the painted, stage-set effects of surface texture, or fabricated and CGI elements in so many scenes. It's gorgeous, and perhaps looks \\"real\\" to most people, but it sometimes reeks of Jar Jar Binks and the heavy-handed effects in the later Star Wars episodes. The other jarring element of the film, in my opinion, is the decision to treat many of the dwarves as caricatures. There's way too much \\"Dopey\\" in many of them, in my opinion, and while humor is essential to balance the other emotions of the story, I found this element to be heavy handed, unbelievable, and dumb. On the other hand, the casting and acting of Bilbo is brilliantly done. I highly recommend the film; I just wish the Blu-Ray treatment wasn't so excessive and clinical, and I wish Jackson had avoided the doofus aspects of the dwarves. Well -- one more thing. As with Spielberg's \\"Tintin,\\" is it really necessary to have endless video-game action sequences? It's like watching NASCAR.
B009NY43NY|1.0|Worst book in the series. I have read all of them. I should have stopped around book nine. Was excited for a year waiting for this book. I was heartbroken the next day after I finished it. Horrible plot and an even more horrible and anti-climactic ending.
B007S1RGUQ|4.0|I have been a super fan of Bonnie Raitt's talent for so many years, I can't remember. Her live concerts are even better!
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Looking out for the little guy has always been my quest. Action packed twisted ending, imbedded love story help the plot move along.
B00821OX98|5.0|I have really enjoyed watching it on amazon. Now I can catch up on all the episodes with my prime membership.
B0010SKSTO|5.0|Its amazing how little we understand about body language. Once you are exposed to this knowledge you find yourself automatically thinking about is this persons physical demeanor match what they are saying. Its actually fun to observe people to try to determine their attitudes, feeling etc. I have reread this book several times and always come away with great new learnings.
B0053O8AQE|4.0|Absolutely a gem - an incredibly attractive and sexy blond (formerly rich) helps a friend toward a dream of a cupcake business.  Admittedly the blond is the only real attraction, physically, in the show, but the writing shows clever use of sexual puns not normally encountered, all though they also play on the time worn &#34;come, cum&#34; words too (just to be complete I guess.)  Very funny show, and Garret Morris is on it too!!
B0061PEAUY|4.0|Many players, keeps you thinking. Always learn something new of areas I wouldn't normally visit<br />and or things that you don't come across on purpose
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Another great social issue book by Picoult.  This deals with a pact between two teenagers.  One of them dies and the relationship and the pact are taken to court.  This book deals with neighbors who were great friends, but became enemies.  This book deals with living in prison until a trial.  This book deals with having guns in the house and training house members how to handle guns.  This book deals with the overwhelming fear that comes with a secret pregnancy.  The book deals with the powerful dedication that teens have in a romantic relationship.  I recommend this book for anyone who works with teenagers.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|like the way the birds fly through the air weightless; interesting to see them fly and bounce; entertaining, fun, interesting
193700788X|4.0|Sure, perhaps things could have ended differently but this was still an enjoyable read. I've always loved the series. I do think when a series goes on too long, there are always issues. I'm sure if the series had been carefully planned out in the beginning, there wouldn't be as many readers feeling betrayed.
B001DUDKEY|4.0|Amanda Root plays the neglected middle one. The way she is completely aware of the utter shallowness of her relatives whilst keeping her remarks to herself is well-acted. I recently saw her in the Forsyte Saga. Another streaming video. There too she played well.
B002XXNSF6|5.0|Great movie that starts an excellent idea for a trilogy. Check out before sunset and before midnight. If you like action movies where stuff continually happens, then don't bother with this one.
B008F5YDRI|3.0|It came with hype. I think it's ok. No big deal. Acting is fine. The story line is simplistic. The title promises something with a twist. But that didn't quite pan out.
B00936A2SM|5.0|I liked the idea of a \\"fusion's greatest hits\\" collection, which this cd displays. Henderson-Berlin-Chambers never sounded better. If you like this genre, it doesn't get any better than this. \\"Stratus\\"(Billy Cobham)is Chambers playing his ass off in his own tribute to one of his all time favorite drummers. The Weather Report remakes would make Shorter and Zawinul proud. A great effort from the three leaders of this project. Buy this cd and sit back and listen to some cats that know how to play!!!
B005PK57IK|5.0|I love how Alecia is becoming darker. LOVE LOVE Christine Bernaski (sp), is this role, such a talented actress.  Wish they'd keep the politics out tho.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|free and has a lot of sounds, i use it to put my baby and self to sleep or just play with it.  can't beat free
B008Q0CO0U|3.0|Not brilliant, but worth the watch.  Anything with Marky Mark in it is fab. Very Rambo like, but I still like it.
B0052BZ6X8|4.0|Not great, not bad. Definitely worth a watch one time. Audio and video were great. No problems streaming. Open for a sequel.
B006LSZECO|5.0|From the title I thought it  was some sort of riomance novel.  Boy was I wrong!!!  I would definitely recommend it.
B00AW8UK0K|5.0|We have started on  the plan and so far every thing looks good. Loosing weight and feeling good. We are very happy with this book
B007ZBWJXI|4.0|I liked this asia album just like I liked the first 3 albums.  there were years were they didn't do anything for me.  this album is a return to that earlier style. unfortunately once you've heard an asia album you've heard all asia albums.  still it's a nice album and since I don't spin them too often it's a nice reminder.  it's comfort rock for me.  like mash potatoes in gravy.
B0002WZTOI|5.0|Love this movie, recommend it to everyone. You will love it. Tom is great in this movie and Kelly is beautiful.
B001DF68MA|2.0|I was so excited to get my Wee Ride Kangaroo for Christmas 2012.  I spent time living in the Netherlands where bicycles are the main mode of transportation and this seemed similar to many Dutch kids seats I had seen.  That combined with the great reviews on Amazon made it simple that this is what I would ask for.  I have a women's Specialized commuter bike, nothing too fancy.  When we first tried to set it up on Christmas day, the Wee Ride simply would not attach to my bike. I then spent another week trying to find a seat post that would accommodate the Wee Ride. I finally ordered one offline.  Once it arrived (nearly two weeks later) I was so excited to get to go for a family ride.  It would be fair to say I was crushed when I first hopped on the bike and realized that in order to peddle with the WeeRide attached you have to swing your knees waaaaay out to the side in an unnatural way.  You can not stand and bike up a hill because the seat is in the way and in order to simply peddle you have to have you knees at least 45 degrees out from the bike.  We had my husband try it out and he experienced the same problems.<br /><br />Perhaps it is my bike, because I see pictures and have read reviews from others that did not seem to experience this, but I was very upset.  Especially since it was a gift and a month had gone by before we finally had to sit down and admit there was no hope for it, so I had no way to return it and try something else.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love, Love, Love Downton Abbey!  I can't wait for season 4 to get here!  It's not about sex or violence, I can watch it with my grandkids.  I wish American producers would learn from this series what is worth watching and immulate!
B007IXWKUK|4.0|As erotic as the first, but as the story matures, so does the writing. I would definitely recommend this book & look forward to #3.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|I have a new favorite game for the kindle fire it can keep me entertained for hours at a time musst download
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|A good way to have fish without too much effort.  Very colorful and my kiddo likes it a lot too.
B00A7W29BE|5.0|I have always used cam scanner as my go to scanning app on my phone.  I tried this one out when it was amazon's free app of the day.  Wow did it surprise me.  The flash on the camera works with any image, which I cannot say for cam scanner.  Cam scanner does a little bit better of a job with boarder detection, but the quality of scans on this app makes it better by default.  I also wish there was a little bit easier of a way to combine the scans, but after a little bit of messing around, figuring out how to do it is very easy.  I hope the developers continue to improve this app, but even right now it is still the best option for scanning on the go.  Major props to the developers.
0670014893|1.0|First of all, I'm not a big Le Carre fan.  I \\"read\\" them mainly because my job gives me lots of time when I can listen to CD books while I work and Le Carre's books are available as audiobooks.  However, most of them are plodding and boring.  This book is no exception, but has the additional complication of being stupid.  In war, there are always innocent casualties.  If we had demanded no collateral damage in World War II, everyone in Britain would be speaking German.  Yet, some very simpleminded people think that wars may be fought without even one innocent person getting hurt.  This is not reality.<br />In this book, a government agency goes after a terrorist.  For a variety of rather stupid reasons, a civil servant totally unqualified to be on such a mission goes along.  In the course of this fictional mission, the terrorist isn't there, an innocent woman and child are and they are killed by mistake.  The rest of the story is how the main character and a few others want to blow the whistle on how this secret mission went wrong, at the same time insulting the entire war on terrorism, America in general, religious people, the tea party and everyone else who is not a Socialist pacifist.  He even disparages the American invasion of Grenada, seemingly forgetting, if he ever knew, that the President of the country had been killed and a vicious coup was the reason for the invasion, an invasion for which the people of Grenada, at least those I have spoken to when I have visited, are very thankful.<br />It's a poor novel and an exercise in political correctness, a bad combination.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|What a great show !  I am sorry I missed it when it first aired.  Well worth watching.  They remind me of LA Law in the beginning.
B009LGO88E|4.0|The circle pad pro xl works great. Granted, it is only a larger version of the circle pad pro and still has the same problems the smaller version does. (No game cartridge, stylus or sd card access while it is on the 3ds) However, the accessory delivers what it is designed to do and that is make dual joystick play possible. Overall, I would definitely recommend it to anyone with the few games that support it.
B001FVV2X2|5.0|Reminds me of how the X-Files started. The first few episodes I wasn't sure if I would like the main characters all that well. As they are growing on me, the show is getting better. Walter is becoming my favorite character so far. Distracted brilliance. Thanks Amazon for allowing me to watch this show with my Prime membership!!
B000VDDDY6|5.0|Really nice film quality improvement
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|survival craft is the best game rather than minecraft.<br />I have been playing the game for hours of fun and war with polar bears.I hope you do the same.
B0012PDVQ2|1.0|If you like special effects and panning shots, enjoy.  If you like a good story to drive it all, I would avoid Blade Runner.  The novel that inspired the film is worth reading, but I would not watch this again.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|There's not a ton of extras, but what's there is really interesting, especially the in-episode background features. Be sure to check them out.
B00770KR7W|5.0|I love this product.  Made by McFarlane Toys, it offers the most accurate and precise replica of the Master Chief of the Halo franchise.  The package was promptly shipped and arrived quickly.  I recommend ordering this figure if you wish to have the best replica on the market.
B008K9SG9K|5.0|i only knew 2 songs when i bought the album, but they are diverse and catchy.  i like most of the album.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|While this app is highly engaging and makes excellent use of graphics and visuals, its gameplay and plot are rather linear, and there is too much pestering to make In-App-Purchases, so I have to give it 4 stars.
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|Having grown up with the Eagles and their music, I was ecstatic to see this History become available. WOW, what a story! So much magic in their harmonies...recommend it to all Eagles fans.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Very enjoyable, a fantastical tale!  I wish it was real so I could attend a circus like this one in the book.
B008602KQI|5.0|Well done sci-sfy story that is almost believable. A remake of Alice in Wonderland that ends with a love story. I may watch it again.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Before I bought this I never knew how much battery life I had left, it's very helpful to easily check.
B00499QUK2|5.0|This show is fantastic! Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman have great chemistry and the show keeps you on your toes!
B007SGM084|3.0|Most reviews I saw were black and white. People loved it or hated it. I am grey. I really like one main character and dislike the other. I agreed with some reviews about the amount of repetition but let's face it, people can be like that in real life. It was a quick read with the first two books complete in one weekend. I do think there is some potential in the characters and the story that never quite climaxes in the way you hope. Ok and glad to know what the hub bub was about. I did find myself thinking about the characters and why they would do certain things which must mean something resonated with me. I also found myself skipping a few sex scenes because well geez there was just so many.
B008133MDK|5.0|This show is fantastic! Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman have great chemistry and the show keeps you on your toes!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton Abbey is my favorite show, and I love it!!!  Although, I really don't like the end of the Season 3 finale. Very sad...
B00AYDC5HY|5.0|5 & 7 years old, both loved it, as well as their parents and grandpa. A sweet, fun, movie with a few scary and emotional moments(Disney style).<br />Definite recommendations!
B004UID2LC|5.0|This app is so cool. I can download movies to watch on the go for FREE... it runs smoothly all the time so it's a great app if you know how to use it.
B00BP29SAA|5.0|My 3 year old son loves this app! It's one of my favorite apps that I have downloaded for him.
B005MLOOJA|5.0|It was great being able to watch the first three seasons of The Good Wife at no charge.  I love my Amazon Prime subscription
B0070XB0N6|5.0|This is my 2nd book I read of Neil Gaiman and I have to say – WOW!!  Just like “The Graveyard Book”, this book had everything I like – thrills, chills, suspense & mystery!!  Towards the end, I was so engulfed into the story, that I could actually feel goose bumps.  Good job Neil – book #3, here I come!!
B009NY43NY|3.0|It was ok but I feel like it was rushed and I didn't like how the book ended. There is so much more she could of Done with the end book of the series. I'm kinda sad to see it go like this.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|I never got to download it. Just because I'm on assignment in Afghanistan. I'll bet it would be great if I could get it.
B006VFLIYK|3.0|This book about a government hit man started well but did not end well.  The ending was farfetched and unrealistic in my opinion.  Revenge, when the stakes are this high, seems ludicrous especially with the twists needed to make the story come together.  Really not very believable.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|Absolutely love this television show!  Always thinking about the characters and the plot.  I love the time period; dress; hair; architecture and the dynamics between the staff and their royal employers.
B000NA28HU|5.0|Favorite movie to watch and I am lucky to have found it. Thank you every much for this movie, wow
B004QX07G4|5.0|I just love her anyway but after reading this book it gives you even more insight to how wonderful she is. I'd love a chance to just sit and chat with her candidly. SHe seems like such a fun and down to earth person!
B00CWM3F4C|2.0|I know, I know, what did I expect? The days of Layne Stanley are definitely gone. Even though there are feeble attempts to catch that classic Alice and Chains groove that we all loved. I don't find much emotion tied into this album. I can only hope it will grow on me, because my first listen, I'm not impressed.
B00CRQV1TY|5.0|I have loved most of these songs for a long time and normally don't like reinterpretations of classics like this. However this one is done so well that it is like hearing great music for the first time! I got it because Rolling Stone gave it a 5 out of 5 rating, which is extremely rare and also extremely accurate!
B0089LOG02|5.0|I loved this book. I especially enjoyed the comparison of the storyteller and the story receiver. Their lives and feelings were not very different. I had heard of the Orphan Train many years ago and didn't know much about it.<br /><br />Thank you very much for a very good and thought provoking book.
B00A7W29BE|3.0|Works well on my HTC, but I uninstalled soon after installation. Nothing wrong, works well but as it &quot;scans&quot; in PDF and jpg I thought what's the point when I can access my 8mp camera quicker and do the same.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It cool you people should get this app it cool wwe stilel<br />Sweet swee rolblox wwe theme is cool you people are going to be a good thing to draw a airplane free how to add to draw a line in the singer of airplanes l and UN General motors Corp the emily yes I know I survived the oscars and UN General manager for the end
B00C5GZKVQ|4.0|Fun game, but I have found it got old quick. Still, it was free. Yay for free apps. Good time waster.
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|If you like tf2,you should try this, it adds a little rpg to the game you love, minus pyro, engine,and scout, but their weapons are still there, plus a new class ,named after soldier who is a neutral character in stats.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|This was the only way that my hubby and I were able to watch this season last year before it came out on Dvd!! The best show that's on television!!
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|The movie is entertaining but not very convincing.  If you have a couple hours to waste, it's not a bad way to do it.
B00AG297GK|4.0|It has funny parts, but also some slow parts. &#34;It's not a boy, do you want me to put it in the garbage?&#34; I would watch it again.
B00AAKZPUK|4.0|The plot is a bit off the wall, but the acting is good, and the action is entertaining.  It paints a picture of the CIA that is slightly unfair, but it's probably not too far from reality, especially considering the CIA role in toppling the elected governments in several countries, including Iran, where they colluded with the oil companies to install the Shah.  But overall, the plot is more entertaining than believable.
B008Y73940|5.0|Attractive cast with good acting. I didn't know much about it before watching, the twists in the plot kept my attention. I highly recommend this movie.
B00BS4PF0C|5.0|What an incredibly gifted singer. This is one of his best albums yet I think. The boys round here song is awesome!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this app. Minecraft is a beast app!!! If you're looking for a great game, here you go!!!! BEST APP EVER!!!!
B009LRE040|5.0|downloaded this at the same time as the Avengers movie by Joss Whedon which is higher rated....I'm a Joss Whedon fan, bought the complete Buffy and Angel series, total of about 12 TV seasons, about 220 episodes.... Joss sucks there, nothing new, just a rehash,  just another \\"end of the world\\" episode that he has done 200+ times before but here with less character and plot development... Batman Dark Knight Rises however is stunningly awesome on many levels to some people...
B00992CF6W|5.0|My friends always said get minecraft but no. When I finally got minecraft I quickly got addicted. Minecraft update 0.7.0 has cake, buckets, milk, eggs, and more. Get ready for the update which is coming on May 29, 30, or 31. Have you ever been wonder<br />Ing how to get melons? Well you have to build 4 butter blocks (gold) or 36 gold ingots.  Then have at least 20 cobblestone blocks. Then build the nether core. Finally go online and figure out how to put the order together. Yes that's right a code. Don't mess up like I did. To plant melons you have to have melons seeds. Then have 2 dirt blocks in a row. Then hoe the first dirt block and put a melon seed there. Well minecraft is awesome and you can do almost anything.
B004UID2LC|5.0|I FEEL THAT THIS APP IS VERY GOOD!!! IT LETS U DOWNLOAD MANY MANY VIDEOS!!! U CAN SEARCH VERY MANY DIFFERENT VIDEOS!! THE ONLY COMPLANT IS THAT SOMETIMES WHEN I GO TO SEARCH IT SAYS &quot;NOT RESPONDING FORCE CLOSE&quot; THEN U GET OUT OF IT AND GET BACK INTO IT!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|I think this game is a fun and playful game. I'm always playing temple run 24/7 I can't stop but FUN!!!!!!
0670024813|3.0|Jared Diamond's past books have all been somewhat controversial but varying in popularity.  Guns, Germs, and Steel was the most famous but his themes are also present in lesser known books like the Third Chimpanzee.<br /><br />This is much in the same style.  He has a unconventional thesis and gathers other people's research plus anecdotes to justify that thesis.  The idea being explored is how modernity is inferior in some ways to more primitive societies and Jared Diamond's own theories on how to create a synthesis of the best of class.<br /><br />That's the blatant agenda which mars the book, which has a great many interesting historical/anecdotal evidence which highlight how topics like justice, child-rearing, war, etc... are dealt with among different societies.  Some of the lessons are applicable and practical.  For example, the medical establishment is coming around to the idea that doctors should apologize directly to the patient/family when there's a bad outcome.  There are fewer lawsuits and smaller settlements than if the patients feel like the doctor doesn't take responsibility.  That's a good point made by Diamond in comparing modern systems to villages - the importance of acknowledging anger/loss to mitigate impact.<br /><br />Sadly, the book goes off the rails when Diamond starts making his deliberate blind spots obvious.  For example, children are not forbidden to climb trees by modern society - their parents don't allow it.  That's from the same \\"constructive paranoia\\" that he praised when it came to his New Guinea friends.  If a child climbs trees or jumps into rivers, there's a chance of death/injury.  It's necessary for adults who need to hunt/forage to be able to climb trees and cross rivers.  But it's a foolish thing for a child to learn to climb trees when that's not a necessary adult skill.  Thus it's entirely logical for parents to prefer children not climb trees.<br /><br />That's one of many examples of logical gaps when it comes to JaredDiamond's praise of native society - he fails to analyze the behavior of people in western societies the same way he applies analysis to his topic of study.<br /><br />Jared Diamond himself exemplified the hypocrisy of his thesis.  He witnessed native society's way of raising children, but he did not choose to raise his family that way.  He does not live in an extended community with his own family members.  He only spends short amounts of time in New Guinea and only as part of well-funded expeditions in a lifestyle which has little resemblance to how natives live.<br /><br />In short, he has unrealistic views about the lives of the people of New Guinea the way a tourist to has unrealistic views of how great it'd be to live in Hawaii.<br /><br />I would recommend people to purchase Guns, Germs, and Steel because it's worth re-reading multiple times.<br /><br />I recommend people check this book out from the library and just read it once.
159463176X|5.0|This book, for me, like Hosseini's other books, is a spell binder, moving me to tears, profound in its portrayal of lives, deep in its portrayal of brutality, fate, love, loss and above all, the yearning to re connect. I couldn't help marvel at the skill of the storyteller in creating a story that deeply affected me, the reader, in also thinking deeply about what people do to each other, and why it is, that such events take place, especially of course, the setting of Kabul, and environs, but around the world, because the story does itself move to other places. For me there were many points of personal recognition, as in the symbolic significance of feathers, the longing for belonging, for roots, and the holes left behind, when children are separated, when bonds are broken, and how famiies somehow reconnect. It's magical, it's sobering, it's sad, and it's provocative in terms of the underlying questions about what we do, about how the world turns, and what directs us inwards and outwards, in the construction of personal life meaning. Bravo!
B00669MFA2|5.0|A great ending to the series, I wish the final battle would have included Hagrid's brother (Grawp). I mean whats the purpose of introducing him into the movie the Order of the Phoenix if he wasn't going to be in the final battle seen. I also wish the Centaurs would have made an appearance. But even with all this out it was a great movie. Ps. wish they made an extened addition.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Good story, well told, the characters are very engaging, and the plot unfolds in an interesting way.  I have already purchased the next series to continue.
B00A8V3VVG|5.0|The only thing my wife and I love more than this movie is the soundtrack!  Great mix of classic and modern songs.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|This will become a classic like Fiddler on the Roof, Sound of Music, South Pacific, Rent, Les Mis and more.  Timeless and classic.  A great soundtrack even if you've never seen the show or read the book.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I love this series! I think I was born in the wrong time period because I love the lifestyle and different way of living
B005IEGUDY|5.0|I can not wait to read the rest of his works.  Wish I had read it before touring England.  His book made me live the history - brought it to a wonderfully detailed account of the inhabitants lives from the past up to and including the futrue.  Marvelous writing and story of great informational content.
B00CW665VI|5.0|This book has me laughing from beginning to end. I never wanted to put it down. Loved it!  Not a series was another bonus!
B00CATSONE|5.0|You wont want to stop reading this biography of a truly great man. I wish that I had read about him earlier in my working career.  I am giving this book to my teenage son so that it may ignite a flame for him.  Thank you Sean for such a well written book that truly captures and conveys the character of such an amazing man.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Somehow, Lassiter and the Pixar gang flew this under the Disney corporate-story-squasher committees (Brave) and produced a terrific story coupled with great animations.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Great movie to watch at all hours of the day.  Definitely an eye opener and made me realize how much I had missed during the actual event.
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|When I first saw it, I have to admit, I was put off by the high voice.  For some reason, I had it in my head that one of the most characteristic traits of Lincoln was his deep sonorous voice.<br /><br />How did I get that impression?  Grade school indoctrination, perhaps.  Perhaps envisioning those powerfully worded speeches being delivered simply cast them in an authoritatively deep voice in my mind.  Further research indicates that this tall, lanky man was indeed a tenor.<br /><br />So, I have to get past that, which is harder than it should be.<br /><br />But, I think even that superficial misperception underscores how difficult it is to really understand the uncertainties of that period of American history.  We can look back after it's all settled and nod our heads, but how it would all turn out was a much bigger question in the day it was happening.<br /><br />The portrayal focuses on the slavery issue, but the real issue to Lincoln was the preservation of the union, which he was willing to enforce at any cost - including suspending the constitution and ignoring the fact that the southern states had ratified the constitution only with the proviso that they could secede.  Slavery was secondary (he certainly was vehemently opposed to it), and was adopted enthusiastically late in the war - mainly as a propaganda to maintain public support for a conflict that had dragged out much longer and become much more vicious than anyone had anticipated.<br /><br />We like to think of the ultimate outcome of the war as the abolition of slavery, but perhaps a more pernicious outcome was centralization of power in the federal government - a centralization that has continued to expand to proportions that extend into almost every aspect of life, today, and has for all intents and purposes usurped the sovereignty of the states.  An expansion that is increasingly accepted and even desired by a population with much different expectations of the nature and role of government from that of the 1860's.<br /><br />The interaction between Lincoln and Mary is explored interestingly, but how accurately is anyone's guess.<br /><br />Bears more analysis, I think.
B00BF11STU|5.0|Great movie to keep the heart pumping.  No sleeping allowed at zero dark thirty.  Recommend watching it with no interruption.
B008VVT51U|5.0|A 'fish out of water' story, or several fishes out of water, and how they handle their visit to an advertised 'posh' resort in India that isn't quite the exclusive escape they expected.  Really superb character performances by all - somewhat like 'Love Actually' with all the interwoven stories, except here, everyone is thrown in the pot from the front.
B005PK57NU|2.0|&#34;Sequels would get progressively worse,&#34; so states Murphey's law.  Season 1 and 2 were excellent, then they ran out of new ideas.
B009NY43NY|4.0|It was good, but I was left wishing there had been an epilogue looking a few years into the future to see how things were. (Like in Harry Potter) In Sookie's world, nothing stays stable for long so I would have liked to see a 3-5 years down the road if she was happy. I predicted most of it last year, I don't think Charlaine strayed far from what people expected. I thought a few parts were kind of corny, too. I will miss the characters but honestly, it had run it's course, the last few books were forgettable. (I have to re-read them, I can't even remember much from them!) I did like that she gave most of the characters a cameo, they all seemed to come around in this last book!<br /><br />And now I'm finding out that they are publishing in October another book, &#34;After Dead: What Came Next in the World of Sookie Stackhouse&#34;. It will update you on Sookie and apparently tell you what happened next and have a character guide. This could easily have been added to the end of Dead Ever After. I'm so disappointed in Charlaine, it was bad enough that she gave Sookie to HBO to do with what they wanted and stray so far away from the Sookie that she created. If she wanted to put a reference guide out there, that's awesome, but to put an ending in it? You're now making people purchase another book just to read an epilogue? I feel robbed. I now have to wait half a year to read an epilogue, and pay another $15 just to read it.<br /><br />THAT being said.... I do want to thank Charlaine for these books. I think they're my favorite above all other series.
B009U9S6FI|5.0|There are no words to describe how many life lessons are in this interesting and powerful book. It's a classic, one to be read over and over.  You will be thankful you read it!
B004G606K8|5.0|Can't recommend this book enough, it might be cliche with a lot of what it does but damnit it does it well!
B00CFQN12Q|4.0|Worth watching. Brought the story line up to date. It was like catching up with an old friend. See it if the first were fun to you
1452110581|5.0|This was laying in my living room over the Christmas holidays. Nearly everyone who came over would pick it up at some point and  start reading some aloud. Short, entertaining, very funny.
B009CF3P7E|5.0|Great story idea. Helped catch me up before going to the theater to see the next one?  I enjoyed it.
B00COHAUD4|3.0|Had been looking forward to this to come available as an on demand rental since its release - best thing I can say now having seen it is it was engaging for a while, but in my opinion they really dropped the ball in the last quarter of the movie.<br /><br />Hindsight being 20/20 i would have waited til this hit redbox, and would advise others likewise - its worth the dollar rental cost, it truly is 'ok'and not a 'bad' movie -but not more. It is not worth renting for $5 unless you really cant find something else and don't mind the 5 bucks too much.
B00BZAJMWG|5.0|Stellar. My family did enjoyed it. Good story. Great acting all round. I thought it was well worth the coin.
B001AMWTAG|5.0|There is something about digging into bands early work when you first hear them on the radio, this is a must!
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|The charger cord works great & It came on time!! I am always hesitant to order electronics on line but this seller did everything they said they would.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This game is awesome. You get to hatch dragons, feed them, breed them, and compete with them. It is really addicting  and makes you want to spend a lot of money on the game.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|*spoliers*<br /><br />This book was truly amazing. I actually started reading this when my friend started so we read it together. Whenever we talk to eachother now,we always say \\"okay\\" or \\"its a metaphor\\" we always talk about this book now.<br />I don't cry easily,but this book made me cry... a lot. It felt so real and I wished there love was forever.<br />but I have to say, I like the not-so-happy ending of the book. I think it makes the book seem more like a reality.<br />Overall this book was amazing. I dint regret buying this for a second. I never wanted to it down as soon as I started it.
B000W94FIW|5.0|I enjoyed this book because it was equipped with all that interest me; love and unbiased words of wisdom.  Although Paulo Coelho is known for putting helpful truths throughout his story telling he never ceases to amaze me or bore me with redundancies. Brilliant!
B004JMSIRC|5.0|Movie came as described in a timely fashion. It is only the bluray, not a combo with the dvd and digital versions for those who care about that. Can't beat it for 10 bucks!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I enjoy to play this game. It has a lot of great features, such as entering competitions for your horse to compete in. Just recently, there are some pop-up commercials onto the screen, which is a little bit annoying. Overall, I really like this game.
B005544TRQ|5.0|I'm an attorney and this show is everything I wish the practice of law was (which is why it is entertaining).
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|We are watching for the second time around.  We watched this show when it came out and enjoyed it and now 10 years later we are still enjoying it.  When you get older you can do that because you forget most of it.
B008IGP8QE|5.0|I love this music as soon as I got it I immediately downloaded it to my mp3. I think it good music for anyone who love pop/dance music
B008BU75IQ|4.0|I enjoyed the book.  it did get you caught up from his frist book on the<br />clifton Chronicles.  Sorry he left us hanging again.  when is his next<br />book coming out?  Waiting with Baited breath.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|Good development of characters. Well written. Novel twist on the usual crime novel. I really enjoyed this book. Have ordered another book by the same author.
B00A0MJA1I|5.0|Bought this for my daughters, as it was one of my favorites as a kid, and they love it as much as I did :)
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Great little puzzle game.  Unique and interesting puzzles throughout.  Only wish it was longer so Please Make more!  End review.
B0061QD82E|5.0|Bought this for my daughters, as it was one of my favorites as a kid, and they love it as much as I did :)
B00BC24NT4|2.0|Le Carre is losing whatever he had.  This book is too slow moving, and not interesting.  Keep falling asleep reading it.  Can't seem to finish it because of it.  Whatever he had before is gone in my opinion.
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|Not the greatest movie of all time, but entertaining.  Worth five bucks.  1 part James Bond, 1 part CSI, 2 parts Bourne Identity.
B003B02PF4|5.0|Grisham consistently delivers an exciting story with many unexpected twists and turns.  His books are always fast page turners that keep me up to finish them.  Favorite writer after Daniel Silva.
B00ABKGG0C|4.0|This book hit all the right notes with characters and story. The ground work has been laid for a wonderful series. I will gladly read the next one.
B009NY43NY|1.0|Loved this series when I started it a few years ago. Then the books started to it seems, go off track. The last three books seems more like pointless ramblings with nothing really happening. Still like the author and would still read her stuff but this series was drawn out.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Short but very entertaining game.  Amazing graphics, good sound effects,  and a puzzle that makes you think, but not so hard that you get frustrated with it.
B007ADJTMK|5.0|as an italian-american, i been visiting sicilian every since i was a boy. the movie is so true about day to day life there.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|As a Realtor it is nice to know not only conditions Now but the forecaster has saved me from<br />embarrassment more than once. How many umbrellas do I need when showing a home?<br />Do I need boots? Gloves? During severe storms I can check and see exactly what is happening.<br />This is the first weather app I have purchased and honestly I'm happy with it. The Weather Channel<br />exceeded my expectations.
B00AKFG15S|1.0|This is very poor I was looking forward to reading the latest novel by Jeffrey Archer it was a total disapointment very amaturish and the plot was as if it was written by a school child<br /><br />Ray Moran
B003TSEEDY|4.0|This is a very interesting book my daughter read she really enjoyed it! I recommend this book to everyone who is looking for a good book to read
B005SFR7YE|5.0|This musical is my favorite. Love that they did a rendition of the stage show (although it isn't the exact same thing as the original stage show, a little different). There are some differences from the stage show that I don't like. One of my favorite parts is the crashing chandelier. That doesn't happen in this one It just sparks. Still cool, but not the greatest. Singers are great. The gal who plays Carlotta really brings great depth to the character. The guest ballet dancer in the first opera rehearsal is awesome and super hot! Also love the huge orchestra used, really brings out the sound well.
B009NY43NY|2.0|I have read and mostly loved every book in the series.  There is, however, not much heart or effort in this one.  It does not take away from the excellence of many of the earlier books, but it might have been wiser to simply set the characters aside for several years so that IF there needed to be an ending, it could have been something more than was delivered.
B0089XH38M|5.0|AVG Antivirus is great for the Android Tablet.  It is great monitoring the tablet and keeping it running smooth and clear of any problems that may arise.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|another good love story from Nicholas. the book is FAR better than the movie and well worth the read!! yay!
B0074MZSWW|4.0|Bought the CD after seeing a performance on television.  Find it too repetitive, Would like them to branch out a little more.
B004TMPJP6|5.0|I have been trying to find a to do list type app for the longest that really fit my needs. I have downloaded and removed several trying to find the best one. I've finally did with wunderlist. Not only does it sync across devises but i can make sub-lists and sub-due dates and reminders. It allows me to cross items offoff the list if i don't complete a task all at once and so i can see how close i amam to completing the task. Plus it allows Me to customize the screen abs set backgrounds to make the app more visually appealing to me. I an able to remember more and i keep better lists with wunderlist. I can grab my kindle and add to my grocery list and know it will be on my phone for me when i go shopping so i can get everything i need. I can mark items off as i put them in the basket so i know i got everything on my list.
B005KDWUFA|5.0|How could you not love this?  Almost as good as seeing them in concert!  Can't wait for the next one!
B009NY43NY|3.0|A complete let down for the end of the series. Too many stories to try and end in one book.
0812993845|5.0|This book made me laugh out loud.  Kinsella's down to earth humor was right on target, and really brought the characters to life.  A must read for Kinsella fans!
030758836X|4.0|Novel was not what I expected! Crazy people in a relationship!! Kept you interested to see what would happen, though.
B00CXX8KTA|5.0|Absolutely worth the purchase. Great songs vocals and guitar work. This album would make any Thin Lizzy fan happy purchase this album today you will not be disappointed
B00AG297GK|5.0|Great movie! Wasn't thinking it was going to be all that good but was way wrong.... this is a must see
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|Awesome movie.  I've watch this movie probably about 5 times and it is just awesome.  Trust me you will love this movie!
B005FISBTO|5.0|But I love Dexter.  Great casting, plots, acting, and the series satisfies the unholy proclivity for revenge in all of us, whether we admit it or not.
1616550414|5.0|would recommend this book to any zelda fan or anyone who likes video game lore. great value for a great book too.
B007MDB6L0|5.0|8 year old daughter loves it. This is our second copy. Baby brother and sister ruined the first and we had to replace. Other kid movies we wouldn't have, but this is a good one.
B006GLM5EQ|5.0|I'm not really into Vampire shows or movies and honestly only started watching this for the promise of werewolves in later seasons, but I must say I was very impressed with this. Yes, there are Vampires and dealings with them, but it's not a show About vampires. The whole first season was a murder mystery. I loved it. :)
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|I really like the graphics of this game and it's real busy. Maybe needs a few more cut away games but other than that a very cool game
B003G4W49C|5.0|I have loved this book since the 90's.  If you haven't read this then this is a must read book!
B007VUA7VO|4.0|this app is great! I can know how much my battery is and how long its going to take for it to fully charge. I love this app.
B00506NRBS|5.0|Finally, a book about success that addresses the most important question, how to be happy and help others at the same time. Derek says he has what most rich entrepreneurs don't have, which is &#34;enough.&#34; How wonderful it is to know that we don't have to make a lot of money to be successful financially.
B005PK57IK|5.0|This show is great and in my opinion never gets boring!! I hope this show continues for a long time. There are not to many good shows anymore!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is amazing. but they need it to be just a little more diffucult because its way to easy.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|This is a great game for those who like puzzles. I play it every evening to relax after working all day. The graphics are beautiful too.
B007A4SDCG|5.0|I loved it.  Hope it will do me some good and I can overcome this resistance.  Haven't got that far yet.  Might have to read it again.  He knows exactly how we think and react and tells us how to overcome it.  Can we?  A must read for most people who want to do something - anything.
B008N1V11U|5.0|This is a great game it does take up a lot of space but all you have to do is remove some of your apps that you don't play anymore<br />Then you download barman and delete it when you beat the game
B001TH16DI|5.0|It was also great to be able to watch the trilogy of II, III, and IV in sequence and when I wanted to
B000NQPZCO|4.0|No summary, character analyzation or storylines here. That has been written by just about everyone else on Amazon so I will focus solely upon the quality of the transfer of this film to Blu Ray.<br />I do have the SD DVD but when I saw that there was an extended version on Blu Ray I made the purchase.  However, this is not a side by side comparison between the Blu Ray and the Standard Def DVDs.<br /><br />VIDEO...The standard def version of the film was the theatrical release.  Unfortunately, the film on DVD was marred by considerable grain and noise and the muted colors actually looked smeared.  This Blu Ray version is considerably better on all levels.  The slightly muted colors still have a great contrast and color correction creates realistic appearances and skin tones.  Details can be nicely seen even within the black leather jackets the mobsters all seemed to wear. At the same time, you can see that the editors did not take things too far by crushing the blacks and losing these details.  At no point did I see any distracting grain or artifacts of any kind.  Bit Rate appeared to average between the mid twenties and low thirties.  To be honest, except for one scene, I barely noticed the addition of previously deleted scenes.<br /><br />AUDIO...The lossless PCM 5.1 audio presents a clear and transparent sound stage.  While is this a largely dialogue driven film so you can expect most of your audio to be coming from your center speaker,  the front sides do contribute to the infrequent panning of cars.  The rear sound stage's audio is kept pretty low so don't expect much from them other than ambience which will probably go un-noticed.  Your LFE channel will be able to take a rest as there is almost no bottom end to any of the audio.  Audio levels were properly set so you will not have to play roller coaster with your remotes volume control.<br /><br />Extras included the same extras that I had had on the Standard Def version.  Trailers were also included as usual and the not very creative menu was easy to navigate.  All in all, if 'Donnie Brasco' is the movie for you than, by all means, go for the Blu Ray version. The transfer is really quite clean.<br /><br />All my reviews focus solely on the quality of the transfers to Blu Ray of both video and audio and I do hope that this review has been of some help to you in deciding upon your purchase decisions and that I am on the correct path with this type of review.<br />Thanks for reading.nd the not very creative menu was easy to navigate.

B000FC2KL0|5.0|I was expecting the usual music celebrity bio without much substance, and, not being a huge Chilis fan, bought this for someone else in my family.  Once I started reading it though, I couldn't put it down.  Even if it was written with help from a ghost writer/editor, it comes across as refreshingly honest and harrowing account of lifestyle excesses and addiction.  Too much, too soon.  Wow!  Kiedis comes across as a nice guy underneath all the bravado, and not at all the narcissist you would expect.  I don't think I have read a better biographical account of heroin addiction.  It is certainly a cautionary tale, but quite fascinating.
B001QC6QRC|5.0|My 4 year old loved it! Great graphics a little comedy and action packed. It was so exciting we will probably watch it again
B0001MIQHQ|5.0|I love this movie. Its a older one but a good one. And if u haven't seen it you should
B00BYISQTO|5.0|It's their best album to date. Every song gives me chills. I just wish it wasn't so expensive to see them live.
B007EECSFA|5.0|It took me several takes to get past the first chapter.  But I'm a great fan of Kate Morton so I persevered and am I happy!!  I totally enjoyed this book.<br />Once into it, I couldn't put it down.  I came to know the characters and wanted to know more about Dorothy, Vivien  and Jimmy.  Each time I thought I had everything figured out, Ms. Morton took me down another street in war torn London.  I just finished this well-written book and regret that it is over.<br />What a fertile mind.  Can't wait for her next book.  Her best since &#34; House at Riverton.&#34;
B005QJZ5FA|5.0|A terrific sampling of Lana Del Rey's brilliant repertoire, including some of her best known hits (Born to Die, Blue Jeans, Video Games, National Anthem, Summertime Sadness).  I was especially pleased that it includes lesser known but provocative songs  Carmen and Dark Paradise, as well as the more entertaining pop songs Radio and Diet Mountain Dew.  I only wish there were more albums with such songs, starting with Raise Me Up (Mississippi South).  Personally, I think that Lana's incongruous and rather bizarre lyrics -- and baffling illusions to 50s/60s America -- sometimes detract from her talent, but I suspect that is deliberate, to shock and attract younger audiences.  Don't get me wrong, though -- this album makes me want more Lana Del Rey, not less.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I have played Xbox minecraft for a while. now that minecraft is on mobile devices<br />I can play when I'm not home.
B0026772N8|4.0|It starts so slow and dense. He continues that way for 95% of the book which you just have to struggle through. Then it all seems to come together in the last few pages. The view from the top is worth the climb.
B00000JR29|5.0|Of course I had this CD a long time ago until my ex took off with all of my CD's. This was one of them. The only problem I had was with Amazon who refused to have the music to be downloaded on FIRE Kindle. Why should I purchase the mp3 version when I already purchased the CD itself? I tried loading it to my Kindle FIRE and managed to only have at least 4 songs from the CD on it. The main ones I wanted did not load at all which was very disappointing to me.
6302610702|5.0|Great movies, cast, producer and director, not that it contains violence, but that it follows the lives of people and brings their life and places they are at to the silver screen from beginning to end, it is a movie saga that every film student should own and watch, to see how and what a true epic movie really is..
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|This was one of your best yet I only have one way of putting it<br />Yes<br />Great<br />Awsome<br />Funny<br />True
B00BESLHEA|5.0|Twas a good show, indeed. I laughed, I cried. Good music as well.  Good music as well, indeed. See it.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|I love this tv series series because  it feels so realistic and it reminds me of when I was littler It just makes me happy
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|The graphics are terrific, and the many layouts make it interesting and addictive.  The best of the Mahjong games I've bought!
B009NY43NY|4.0|I love the Sookie Stackhouse books. Sad to see them end. Wish it had been a little more detailed about her and Sam at the end, but all and all it was good
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|this is my first g5 game. I will definitely check out more. I enjoy the combination of adventure and hidden object.
B004YW4L5K|4.0|I loved the premise and the way he took us through it.  The last part of the book read easier than the first.  I set it aside a couple of time but came back out of curiosity.  I would recommend it, would just say &#34;patience - it's got a good ending&#34;
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Love the series. But, typical of the BBC shows (Downton Abbey, Spooks (MI5), etc.), there is a lot of character turnover with love interests, important stars, and so on--\\"moving to London,\\" being killed off, etc. :-) It's amazing how moving to Hollywood increases one's longevity for many BBC actors such as Hugh Laurie, Johnny Lee Miller, and on and on.
B00BN3DPQ4|3.0|Arnold is finally back in a starring vehicle for the first time since Terminator 3.  Sure, he popped up in the Expendables flicks, but those weren't headliners for him.  There was a lot of years of anticipation for the Arnold fan of whether or not this movie could possibly live up to those kind of expectations.<br /><br />I will say this, The Last Stand is not a bad movie.  Neither is it a particularly great movie.  I would say it's a middle of the road Arnold movie, but nothing like what we expected and usually got out of the man in his heyday.  To be fair, and it pains me to say this about the icon, but his heyday has passed.  So, in all honesty, this is the type of movie we should expect from him.<br /><br />We tend to forget that before Arnold went off to play politics in the state of California, other than Terminator 3, his movies were no longer banking like they used to.  I feel The Last Stand is certainly better than some of those movies he was making before T3; you know, your Collateral Damages, your End of Days or Jingle All the Ways.  Every single one of those movies I saw in the theater, and this one I didn't.  Go figure.<br /><br />A few things that I really dug about the movie.  It doesn't try to be a slam bang, over the top 100 million dollar budget blockbuster from Arnold's past.  It's a relatively medium budgeted movie with a simple plot with Arnold playing his age.  Sure, they try to throw in a few Arnold-esqe one liners, but it's so not that type of movie.  There's a couple of nice action scenes in the first hour or so, one in which Arnie has to save his deputies that's pretty cool, but most of the good stuff is saved for the last half hour, when we see the titular last stand.  There's a few tense moments, and the deputies get some good digs in at the bad guys.  I feel Arnold is very good in the last half hour of the movie, despite his age.  I thoroughly enjoyed Arnie and his deputies squaring off against the drug lord and his cronies at the end.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the first hour leading up to that feels a bit ho-hum and drags a bit.  I could of used a bit more last stand in The Last Stand.  This time of the movie is a lot of Forest Whitaker huffing and puffing and not really doing much of anything other than lending his name to the movie while Arnold doesn't have much to do other than act.  Let us be honest with ourselves, even as fans, this is not his greatest asset in the world of film.  Breaking bad guys' faces is.<br /><br />Still, it's a credit to director Kim Jee-Woon that even during the first hour of set up for the much better last half hour that he manages to move the proceedings along at a brisk enough pace that you don't catch yourself watching the clock.<br /><br />No way is this a bad movie at all, but it's certainly not iconic, like the Arnold greats of past.  And perhaps that's as it should be in this chapter of his life.<br /><br />As far as the blu-ray-ness of the flick, it looks and sounds great.  I had no problems with the presentation of the movie.  However, special features seriously lack.  I hate that, because I love me some special features.
B001QJUX24|5.0|A true cinematic treasure. John Ford's best. Star studded, great story based on a true event. John Wayne is terrific.
B005G5PPGS|3.0|In 2002, Billy Beane, once a highly touted rookie prospect for the New York Mets, is now the General Manager of the Oakland A's  The conventional wisdom around baseball is that the A's won't be very good in 2002, because they are going to lose three of their best players, Jason Giambi, Johnny Damon and Jason Isringhousen to free agency.  But Billy Beane has been studying the work of baseball statistical guru Bill James, comes up with a new way of analyzing baseball talent, looking at a player's on base percentage instead of looking at statistics other scouts prize, like home runs and RBI's.  With the help of Paul DePodesta, a Yale graduate, who Beane makes head of player development for the A's, Beane remakes the A's on a limited budget.  The results?  The A's won an American League record 20 straight ballgames in 2002, they had over 100 wins and made the playoffs.  Would the rest of the baseball world take notice?<br /><br />I did not like this book.  It routinely bashes my beloved New York Yankees for their big money spending, but that's not why I didn't like Moneyball.  This book takes a very one sided view of Beane's moves as General Manager, it emphasizes Beane's great moves and ignores his lousy moves.  For example, Beane passed up Prince Fielder in the first round to draft Nick Swisher.  I like Nick Swisher, he had a lot of good years for the Yankees , but there is no comparison between Swisher and Prince Fielder, there just isn't.  And the reason Beane passed on Fielder was his weight, at the same time he drafted Jeremy Brown, a 5'8 215 pound catcher that no one's ever heard of before or since, so clearly he had no problem with weight.  The book tells a heartwarming story of Brown hitting his first home run in the minors in the Epilogue of the book, but the real story is that Brown only had 10 major league at bats, and retired unglamorously in 2008.  Similarly, Beane fills the early chapters of the book with stories of how good Jeremy Giambi is going to be,by midseason Giambi is gone. Similarly, he trades 3/8th's of his starting lineup from opening day, which begs the question, how good are Billy Beane's scouting techniques anyway?<br /><br />If the reader reads between the lines, the personal portrayal of Billy Beane is hardly as flattering as his professional portrayal is.  As a player, Beane is talented, but temperamental.  When pitchers adjust to find Beane's weakness as a hitter, he doesn't make the adjustment to make himself a better hitter, he sulked, got shipped around to different teams and retired as a player in complete obscurity.  As a player he didn't use the thing he's lauded for as a GM. His brain. That temperament follows him into the front office, where he gets angry when players don't perform up to the standards he has set for them.  When he cuts Mike Magnante, a relief pitcher, after a particularly bad game, he doesn't have the guts to face Magnante personally, and tell him he's been cut, which is not a sign of a true leader.  Manante was 10 days from his major league pension when he got cut. In fact, his pursuit of relief pitcher Riccardo Rincon, and Boston Red Sox future star, Kevin Youkilis, makes Beane look more like a snakeoil salesman than a General Manager, he tries and succeeds in trading lousy minor leaguers to the Tigers for Rincon, and fails to trade lousy minor leaguers for Youkilis.  The kind of moves that show Beane's character flaws are glossed over, in Lewis' book.<br /><br />The book is better when it focuses on some of the players that Beane picks up and note solely on Beane himself.  When Moneyball tells the story of Scott Hatteburg, a catcher, who couldn't throw anymore, who was given a second chance when Beane brought him to Oakland and transformed him into a first baseman with the help of then A's coach and current Texas Ranger manager, Ron Washington.  Hatteburg worked hard to make himself into a good first baseman, and he was already a good hitter, although Lewis makes Hatteburgh sound like a cross between Lou Gehrig and Roy Hobbes when Hatteburg hits the game winning home run to help the A's win their 20th game in a row in2002.<br /><br />More heartwarming is the story of Chad Bradford, a reliever that Beane took a chance on.  Bradford's father suffered a stroke, but recovered enough to play catch with his son.  From then on, Bradford dreamed of being a pro baseball player.  Unfortunately, his fastball had neither speed or movement, until Bradford's high school coach taught him a submarine motion that gave his fastnball movement.  Years later, Beane and DePodesta noticed Bradford languishing in the White Sox Triple A team and picked him up. Bradford was a big reason the A's had success in 2002.  Beane deserves credit for taking risks on Hatteburg and Bradford, but his lack of a budget compelled these moves as much as the players' talent.<br /><br />The book unfortunately ends on a sour note in a postscript with Lewis once again lavishing praise needlessly on Beane and calling anyone who criticized Beane a member of the \\"Club.\\" Aka protectors of the status quo in baseball, the postscript was unnecessary and made Lewis sound like he had Stockholm Syndrome, because he spent a year with Beane was once again defending every move Beane made.  Here are the facts, for those who take the long view, Beane had four very good years, from 2002 to 2006, he then had four very mediocre years with the A's  from 2007-2011, but Lewis will never write an addendum to his book to state that.  And revenue sharing has pretty much ended the small market big market debate.<br /><br />Moneyball: Fans of big market teams get Beaned by Lewis.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|It installs quickly and provides many ways to create really good white noise for various uses including sleep, meditation and just relaxation as you work. There are many choices and the implementation is simple and straightforward.
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|This game is really fun and challenging. Could give more power ups, but passes the time while waiting on other games to recharge lives.
B0095P31L6|4.0|Always enjoy anything Johnny Depp is associated with.  We thought this was a fun movie to watch and be entertained with.
B00CWVG1Z8|1.0|I wish I could have given this movie 0 stars. I loved this series of books and I understand artistic license when it comes to writing a script, but this was just a travesty. You don't get to just change the story altogether and write main characters out for what I can only think may have been for the sake of convenience. There was no reason to spoon feed every detail of the story in advance rather than letting the plot develop.
0439023491|4.0|I liked this book, but I didn't love it like the first one.<br />Plot: 4/5 Not A to B, and lagging a bit at times.<br />Characters: 4/5 Katniss seems a little depressed and somber in this one. Also, the background characters seem less like characters...<br />SPOILER<br />...and more like background filler as Katniss grows more and more comfortable killing. Soon, she's not even hesitating to kill people any more and this makes her less likable also.<br />Setting: 4/5 Strange, like a bloody wonderland.<br />Writing Style: 4/5 Again, no rude words or humor, but short sentences and too many hyphens.<br />Total: 16/20 A good read, but not as good as book 1.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Love Colleen Hoover. Her characters make me laugh out loud and swoon. I'm a big fan of 'Slammed' and highly recommend 'Hopeless'!
0439023521|5.0|This book is great. I couldn't put it down. It's suspenseful and exciting but doesn't lose itself to the action and-perhaps most shocking-there's no dirty language and (other than violence) \\"adult themes\\".<br />Plot: 4/5 Good, high stakes plot with a twist and a complicated romance.<br />Characters: 5/5 Katniss is a great, likable but dangerous protagonist and the supporting characters are well fleshed out.<br />Setting: 5/5 Never seen anything quite like it. An arena, which is completely controlled by the antagonist, but which you can't leave. More broadly, this is dystopian.<br />Writing Style: 4/5 Surprisingly, this book was pretty clean. The only down side is the author has a passion for short, choppy sentences and hyphens, which sometimes int-erupt the flow.<br />Total: 18/20 A good, nonstop action read which will stay on the shelves for quite some time. Sadly, the sequels aren't as good.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|Very well written book, I'm anxious to read the next one. Would definitely recommend to anyone who enjoys fantasy books and such.
B005UG542S|5.0|This is the last installment of the Harry Potter movies and I think it's by far the best. Everything comes to a head when Harry and Voldemort finally face off, this movie is filled with excitement, passion, and courage. I definitely recommend it.
0062238868|4.0|I was interested in the story of Chris Kyle as one of our more recent American heros.  The book is certainly good as a documentary but not quite as riveting as I'd hoped.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|This movie was funny and entertaining, I laughed out loud at moments and enjoyed it overall. The music and singing was incredible, but I felt like the some of the acting left a lot to be desired. However, it was a fun movie and would recommend it if you're looking for a light hearted comedy.
B000UZNSWM|4.0|Fifty years later, it appears that was a war worth fighting. Look at South Korea today! And North Korea! Leadership flaws are revealed here, too. Halberstam lets us see no only what mistakes the generals made, but the deadly was these errors hurt their subordinates.
B00CWVG1Z8|2.0|I hate to be one of those people that always says &#34;I liked the book better&#34;, but truth be told, I did like the book much better. However, with that being said, I thought the book was just okay, and I found myself getting bored at times during the movie. I thought the main characters did a great job with the acting, but it just lagged at some points and they never really seemed to get any momentum going that would keep me interested. I only recommend this movie if you have absolutely nothing else to watch, otherwise, don't waste your time.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|this is a great app. very soothing. a nice way to relax. great white noise. and it has so many selections you will not be board.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Downton is one of the best shows there is. The rich character development and stunning cinematography make this such a great show to watch. Really looking forward to season 4.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|fun and free. great graphics and highly recommend.  I have recommended this to anyone I know that plays games on their phones or tablets.  kids love it too
B00005LOUP|5.0|I love this movie - it is a great twist on a classic Christmas movie.  Jim Carrey is perfectly suited for the role of the Grinch, and there are lots of laughs in store for this movie as well.  It is a great holiday flick and perfectly executed.
B00992CF6W|5.0|the new Version should be 7.0 in the new update in all today and I hope this happens tommorow this is great
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Love the book.  Haven't seen the movie yet but looking forward to that.  It is a wonderful story and I recommend it to everyone.
B00CRR5YA0|5.0|This score effectively combines classic Trek themes with new & exciting musical pieces that went along perfectly with the action & emotional intensity of the scenes of the movie, which is what a good movie score should do!  HIghly recommended for all Star Trek fans and fans of good movie scores in general!
B009LXEBD4|5.0|I love Kelly Clarkson's music.  She is the first and best American Idol.  Her voice is fantastic and she has lived up to her American Idol status for sure
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|I just finished reading this excellent book, the first in the Raven's Shadow trilogy by Anthony Ryan. This book was a real page-turner; fast-paced and action-packed, had me hooked from the very first page! I know it may be a while but I just can't wait for the second book to get published.
B0054JZC6E|1.0|This game looks fun and is free but the controls are sticky. The game also has all the 101 games that are very hard and they time you so you have to get a very specific score and the worst ones I will say by name. Sushi is very hard because you are timed and after you try to shoot the sushi the chopstick is taking forever to leave where it was and wastes time also it starts at one minute and the sushi comes out so you technically start at 57 seconds and each sushi is 100 points each unless you get a combo. Now the game called flies. worst game ever you have to eat the flies in one minute and the tongue is very slow and when you touch a fly where you want the frog to eat the fly is like already off the screen. This game is TERRIBLE.  Don't buy for crap.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|I think this game is awesome you get to destroy things and you get all the different armor witch is really cool.
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|First, let me say that Jennifer Lawrence was awesome in this (as usual). She completely owned her scenes and her acting was first-rate. (If I could get a mini-version of this with just her scenes, it would be a great movie!)<br /><br />And the movie itself was well-done and very good. But not great. Everyone else was very good, as well. I don't think the other people deserved best actor/actress nominations. Bradley Cooper, maybe. He was very good. But not De Niro and the woman who played her mother. They did a great job; but I don't think it was worth an Oscar nom.<br /><br />Basically, in my opinion, Jennifer Lawrence made this movie what it was, and all the buzz about this movie was because her performance was so great it made the entire movie seem better than it actually was.<br /><br />But, again, it was a well-done movie and definitely enjoyable. But not as great as people are making it out to be.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Finally a show suitable for the whole family. Can watch and enjoy without having to worry about crude vulgar language or content.
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|This book was my Book Club's selection last month. It encouraged one of the bet discussions we have had in a long time. I think pondering the question, &#34;Is there any unresolved relationship in your life that you would walk 600 miles for?&#34; stirred our hearts the most. We all liked the nook very much. We all agreed the characters were still renting space in our heads weeks after finishing the book. They were welcomed, so that is a good thing.
B009VB7QQA|4.0|I generally pick movies for acting, stories, or special effects regardless of genre. I thought Benjamin walker did a better job than I expected for this type of movie, considering his limited acting in movies
B0061QD82E|5.0|I love Disney movies so it was really nice to be able to add Lady and the Tramp to my Disney collection.
B00AE2LJVS|4.0|excellent acting by guy pierce and the 2 older brothers. Shia on the other hand needs more work with dramatic stories.
B0036TGT3E|5.0|Very happy to add this to my collection, I had it on VHS and now on Blu-ray definitely an upgrade!
B009VSW15Y|5.0|Easy to download pictures to Facebook. Easy to use and the pictures turn out great even with movement in the camera or objects.
B00632HWOG|5.0|Just what I was looking for. Easy to use. It is like working on the pc but on the go.
B00992CF6W|5.0|My son bought this game, and it is incredibly addicting.  The kids play it on their Kindles. If they are on WIfi, they can meet up in the same world but on different devices.  Love the pocket edition. I have never played the desktop version, but I imagine it is too complicated for me. This pocket edition is just right.
B00CL6HGIK|5.0|Not many current movies catch my interest these days, but I thought this one was very good...good cast, good storyline, not a huge amount of explicit sex. A lot of the F___ word however - never understand why \\"writers\\" find this necessary...I don't know anyone who talks like that!  Anyway - this is one you will enjoy for the most part - never boring and keeps your attention!
B00AVPYT8I|5.0|I recommend this app. to anyone who likes to read. With the cost of books these days you can't go wrong with it. There are so many different choices to chose from that everyone can find something. It has really saved me alot of money since I read all the time....
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I read about Wool on Twitter and had to read it. Well done Hugh Howey, not just for the writing which is excellent, but also for the sales lesson. I look forward to more silo stories for which I will gladly pay a bit more.
B004I744AS|4.0|It's always good to have a Kindle dictionary with you as you go, and this app is free to anyone with a Kindle Fire.
0375703764|4.0|This is my favorite long book. It was a compelling burden. I went in with very high, but yet also sensible and measured expectations, i.e., not Raiders of the Lost Ark expectations. As an experience this is a five star book, but even though MZD provides two rewarding story lines and many of the seemingly tiresome rambling side anecdotes end with a satisfying insight or are just a good story the book is too long. This probably couldn't be helped because editing House of Leaves would seem to me to be a superhuman task. If you are a heavy super reader type I think you owe it to yourself to try House of Leaves because it is unique, but also rich in quality. I think I would discourage friends from starting it because I don't think it's the type of book you would enjoy lingering over for a couple months, and it could potentially ruin a vacation where you tried to plow straight through it. OK replace \\"ruin\\" with dampen; the former sounds dramatic and intriguing.
B00CRWJ7VC|2.0|The frequent jumps to differents times, people and places caused me to lose track, and interest, in finding out how they're all connected through time.  I don't think understanding the connection would have resulted in a higher rating from me.
B003UESJ9M|3.0|The acting in this movie was commendable, but the story was very sad. Left me feeling rather depressed. Very good music adaptations, however.
B008RA3X5E|1.0|I don'tlike this app. The clock is blurry which is ridiculous when considering the size of the font. What is even worse is I can't figure out how to uninstall it. I'm not that concerned about a refund because it was very inexpensive but I don't like keeping an app on my phone if I don't intend to use it.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This app is on all my devices, phone, computer, Nook and Kindle.  No matter where I am I can see the current weather (temp) and the forecasted weather.  I recommend this app to everyone.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|After the series kicked into season 2, I decided I had to know what &#34;really&#34; happened with these characters.  Other than a dizzying lineup that is hard to follow because there's so many characters, and skipping ahead a few times to get past the boring family linenage parts, OMG I love these stories!!!!
B00CW665VI|5.0|Emma Chase you hit a gland slam!!!  This book is one of the best books I have read in a long time.  Not only was it very cleverly written, it was, laugh out loud, and very sexy at the same time.  I could not put it down, and look forward to reading all your future books.  WELL DONE!!!
B005P06AAO|5.0|I am such a fangirl, I bought this just to watch over and over again!!! The characters are hilarious, and IMHO, better than Glee!
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|Quentin Tarantino never disappoints me. This movie has a great cast,  humor, and action.  I rented this one night and intend to buy it soon.
B00005B1W5|5.0|It takes me back to 2000 when the concert was touring.  I couldn't afford the ticket so I had a co-worker bring me something back from the show.  It was a VHS tape and I wore it out.  I finally got to see him live last year (2012) and it re-ignited my passion for his music.  OMG I love this stuff!!!
B001DM1VXE|3.0|Ok, I've heard about this movie long time ago, when I was a student in CS major, from a friend who was a grad student at the time.<br />Couldn't continue the conversation since I didn't watch the movie...<br />I was looking for this movie, good thing amazon prime offered it for free, so I could finally watch... for free!<br /><br />The movie was OK.  I've especially liked following character's self dialog stating military time everytime he goes into introspection.<br />But I have to say, it reminds me of the short science fiction I wrote during 9th grade English class project.<br />Has some grand premise building up but ending up going no where...  You know, this sort of thing is difficult, or impossible to do...Maybe conclusion was something zen like???<br /><br />I'm pondering<br /><br />(SPOILER ALERT: how can a computer could self aware when it calculates to the overheating states or something?  Now, that is a pure 9th grade science fiction from best of my computer knowelege... am I missing something here???)<br /><br />Giving stingy 3 stars, but it is really well made if you consider ultra low budget.
B009NY43NY|4.0|I've been an avid Sookie fan for years, and hate what HBO has turned it into (for most parts), but this last book was . . . really underwhelming.  I get that CH was over it, but did it need to be so obvi by the disengagement in this last book?<br /><br />It coulda been a whole lot better.
B001D0BLTA|5.0|One of my very favorites. Great teen movie, with laughs and tears. Jon Crier is a hoot. Love the hair!!!
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Great reading.  I felt I was there and endured the feelings of the characters<br />It was one of those books that made you really think about life back then
B009HUB40Y|3.0|I was excited to get a game like Bejeweled Blitz on my Kindle Fire HD but the game isn't what I expected.  It's just not very fun.  I much prefer Bejeweled Blitz and haven't played this game since I got it.
B003QZ5222|5.0|Being a child in the '70's, I cannot help but remember being familiar with a handful of Bruce Springsteen tunes on a.m. radio. Then into the '80's, you have the inescapable juggernaut that was &#34;Born In The U.S.A.&#34; which meant that much more familiarity with his radio-friendly faire. What I hadn't done though was purchased a single solitary title from his catalogue. Until recently that is, finding his two most recent studio albums along with &#34;The Promise&#34;, all of which intrigued me.<br /><br />So imagine my surprise in seeing &#34;The Collection&#34; in a nearby used music store for $25 and thinking &#34;what a perfect package at a great price for a Bruce neophyte.&#34; But wait, that's me! However, I didn't buy the box at that time in favor of some other sweet titles for my collection. Come to find out, Amazon actually had the title brand new for a couple bucks less. Order placed and it arrived within a few days and all I can say is that I am more than pleased with owning these albums. No issues with loading each one onto my iTunes library (which was something mentioned in other reviews).<br /><br />Bottom line, this is a perfect collection for someone who is either exploring the 1973-1984 years for the first time or only has 2 or 3 of these titles. No complaints on mastering, they all sound just to my ears (playing on my computer through Bose speakers). No complaints on packaging, this box of seven albums will take up about the same space on my shelf than the three titles of his I already owned. This is easily six stars out of five!
1401223176|5.0|I found the book to be great especially since I am a Batman fan to begin with. It was sent in great condition.
B009PU2SX8|5.0|one of the best albums i have ever listened to. I am very impressed with his style of music. I will be adding any future albums to my collection
1401216676|5.0|This book was great in its story concerning the Joker and came in a wonderful condition. I liked reading it.
B00BIVN82M|2.0|I was ECSTATIC about the release of his new album.  I am a MAJOR Michael Buble fan--- for a very long time.  That being said- I think I liked only 1 track on this album (Track 2).  I'm so sad- I am aching for some fresh Buble--- but alas, this album sucks- I almost sent it back but I love him enough to give him another chance.  Download the mp3 version or the songs you like- be sure you like the songs before you spend the money.  :(<br /><br />PS- you can totally tell when reviews are rigged- coming from someone affiliated with the artist.  Be smart- I've noticed a lot of those on this album.

B006VFLIYK|5.0|This book was so riveting that I could not stop reading it.  The characters were so real and endearing, and so real
B009NY43NY|3.0|It seems to me that ever since the series \\"True Blood\\" came out her books have lost their focus and have gotten boring. When I first discovered the Sookie Stackhouse series they were a fun, fast paced summer read. The last several books seemed to go on and on without direction. I was relieved she was ending the series.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|very INTERESTING  concept. However it took me a few pages to get into the book. Still I WOULD say it is worth reading.
B000FA675C|4.0|I love all of Dan Browns books. Theyy always have something to teach us. Fast paced and exciting from the start till the ferry last page.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The game is great for the family especially my daughter she has a blast with it...a little laggy at times but overall its pretty solid. I reccomend this game100% for you addicting games lover's out there.
B00004TS0E|5.0|It's a good family movie and we really enjoyed it.  I thought it was heartwarming.  I also accidentally purchase two and planned on returning the other copy but Amazon told me to keep it and still got a refund.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Sad there is not a book 4. I love the mystery in this book. It made the plot better . I think this book is the best of all 3.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wow.  This is as good as it gets.  Very well written and constructed.<br />Action that keeps you on the edge of your seat.  The proverbial page-turner.  It's not that it will be a classic, it IS a classic.  Do not miss this book.
1423165691|5.0|I love A Disney Sketchbook . I am using this book in my art studio and students loves it. Great book
B005MLOOJA|5.0|What a great show. It picks up right where the second season left off. The actors are terrific. Don't miss it!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I can't figure out why I'm not in Miami love this game and want to complete the weekly challenge but I can't. :(
B00445RHKI|5.0|The second season is just as great as the first. All the characters are still hilarious. Don't miss out on the fun!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Grisham's novel held held my interest and had a great ending.  Stopped reading Grisham's books because they became too much the same.  Great characters and good suspense.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|A fun hidden objects game mixed in with a murder mystery along with other puzzles that aren't too hard or too easy!
B009NY43NY|1.0|I'm very upset over this last book. First off, it has nothing to do with Sookie ending up with Sam ( that was the only practical way it could end up). It has to do with how this book was rushed and just finished off. I'm not liking how Eric turned out to be a weak slave you might as well say. Also why was their love built on for more than half of the series just to be diminished, and act as if Sookie was no more than a possession to Eric? We as readers know it was true love between them both. Bill was passed off as nothing but a neighbor that would borrow a cup of sugar, and Sookie would possibly nail if she had the guts for a one night stand. Sookie cursing? Whats that about? We didnt even get a book about any of the main characters really that we have grown to love, or get a proper goodbye. Just mentions here and there. Did CH even write this? I have always had CH's back until this last book. i just feel cheated for being so devoted to her, and this is how she closes the Sookie legacy? I expected greatness, and a fulfilling ending. Not this pile of rubble. Was a ghost writer used?
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Same great quality as Season 1.  Love this series. With the characters developed in depth, it is also a walk down history lane for both the aristocracy and their servants.  Follows changes in thought, fashion, and attitudes during that era.  Excellent!
B004YW4L5K|1.0|Not my kind of book.  I read only 2 chapters but was not impressed.I didn't like the characters portrayed.Good Bye
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Definitely recommend this one.  Keeps you on your toes as much as the first book did.  Enjoy the development of the main characters.
B00BHMEALA|5.0|Loved this stranger-than-fiction real life adventure story of a brazen, borderline crazy plan that worked. Two thumbs up from me.
B00CWV8TIU|2.0|Poor acting unless you count a general lack of catharsis as a quality portrayal of depressed individuals.<br />A plot twist that you can see coming from a mile away.
B00COGY2P2|3.0|Formula piece with just enough tension and mystery to be entertaining. Typical car chase in the on coming traffic lane. Mediocre acting and plot.
B005DNPJKU|5.0|This is one of those films that needs to be re-visited every now and then, just to remember how great it is. David Lynch seems to be better known now for Eraserhead and Blue Velvet...his macabre, unsettling masterpieces dealing with our darker psyches. That's unfortunate, because The Elephant Man deals with those same dark underbellies, morbid curiosities and human cruelties, while offering glimpses of compassion, empathy and redemption his other films seem to lack. Using stark black and white cinematography, he conjures up the gritty and gruesome realities of Weegee's New York City photography to depict London's industrial revolution of the late 19th century. Gaslight, horse dung in streets, walls stained with industrial filth and a cast of characters ranging from the completely depraved to social elite, are all woven together in a rich tapestry wrapped around the tragic life of John Merrick. Not a single frame of film is wasted nor is the exceptionally well crafted storyline and acting talents of Sir Anthony Hopkins, Sir John Gielgud, Anne Bancroft and, what this viewer believes to be one of the finest film performances of the late 20th century, John Hurt. I showed this film to my art history students recently and was surprized to find that only one student had even heard of it! It's hard to believe that this is one is already 33 years old and that it may only show up occasionally on Turner Classic Movies or to hear myself saying, &#34;They don't make em' like this one anymore&#34;! If you're one who hasn't seen it yet, you owe it to yourself to take the time and watch it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This was a great series of books. Once I really got into the first book could not put them down, wish there were more!

B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I am on level 45, the game is a great one and has a outstanding rate of players. I think it is very well developed and is a fun game<br /><br />The whole objective of the game is to breed,build,and have fun. You can also buy gems which speed up the time it takes for dragons to breed, hatch, buildings to build, crops to grow, and more. You can also use gems to buy dragons. You don't always have to buy gems to get them, you can also win and earn gems to.  Another huge thing is Dragon cash. It lets you buy dragons, decorations, food, habitats, buildings, and islands. Once you get the game, it's all about patience. It takes a while to get a lot of gems and Dragon cash, but once you get the idea, it's the best thing ever. This game is awesome, and also, there isn't only seven different types of dragons, but thousands. There is a new Dragon ever couple of weeks, and that makes it fun. I highly recommended this game, it's awesome.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|It's a great game get it I love you can race you can battle I love it it is awesome get it.
B00C2VIA52|5.0|This game reminds me of Magic the Gathering but you don't have to pay 10 to 20 dollars and that's beside all the downloads you HAVE to buy even to play the game. So ya I think overall it's a pretty badass game, well worth the time to at least try it out.

B005544V6A|5.0|It really gets you thinking and is a very exciting and thrilling show to watch. I definitely recommend it! I can't wait to watch the next season!
B005PK57NU|5.0|As with the first two seasons of The Good wife, this season has excellent plots and the acting is first rate.
0062014536|4.0|After reading pandemonium I could not wait for this one.  It did not disappoint.  I love and hate though at the same time you are left with so many questions at the end.  Definitely a series I would recommend.

B00BXLU1EU|1.0|Acts like it's finding passwords but they're boggus. What good is it? The rating shouldn't be even one star. Don't waste yourtime!
B000PAU032|4.0|This two-CD collection has a lot of Hans Zimmer's best work.  But there are also some selections that I don't understand how they made the cut.  These are not the actual soundtrack cuts - they are performed by the same orchestra, and the conductor has added his own interpretations to most selections.<br /><br />&#34;The Last Samurai&#34; is covered in a single selection that is actually parts of several different songs.  It is well done, but I highly recommend the original soundtrack, which I believe is Zimmer's finest work.
B0031RS7MW|4.0|Makes you feel like hot chocolate. Nicely written, you can really feel what the characters are feeling. Good, light read.
B007HGPBRC|5.0|Classic Hitch. Honest and beautifully written. As it was his last book, it ends too abruptly, just as his time with us did.
B002NOH7G6|5.0|This movie is based upon a true story about 300 Spartans against a Army of thousands.<br />The visual effects of the Spartans fighting is amazing as the Director slows down a sequence of the fighting.<br />If you enjoy Historic films or films about true life Warriors you have to watch this movie its amazing !<br />Don't forget about Amazon Prime free shipping for a year / 2 day shipping plus if you have a streaming device for your Television being a Prime member gives you free access to hundreds of 1st rate movies all for no charge !
B000JMKTLO|5.0|I don't usually like this type of book but after reading Gone Girl I decided to give it a try.  I couldn't put it down!  I definitely had a few sleepy mornings due to staying up too late reading.  While I knew who the &#34;bad guy&#34; was fairly early on, there we so many twists that the suspense was addictive!  Try it!
B008G12ERC|2.0|there are only a few good songs on this album. they've gone from amazing (with Absolution, Black Holes, and Origin of Symmetry) to almost awful. I don't mind the dubstep...I actually like that a lot. It's the weird ass other s*** that sounds cheesy and bizarre. and the other dude singing? wat?  muse: please go back to what you were. you were an amazing rock band with a very unique sound. now you're...i don't even know anymore.
B003LQ3YXU|3.0|I'm a huge doctor who fan which is the only reason I'm giving season one 3 stars. The story lines were great and Billie Piper as the Doctor's companion is a treat. However, I simply hate this seasons Doctor! He is so far out shined by his predecessors David Tennant and Matt Smith that I don't even know his name. One thing is for sure, if you started watching Doctor Who in the later seasons and doubled back to catch up on the history as I did, you'll find it hard pressed to watch this guy as the Doctor....he just doesn't measure up.

B006IYG5HE|4.0|My first Harry Hole read but not my last. . . . An endearingly flawed but forceful detective in a corrupt Norwegian -- how is this possible? -- police authority and a story that draws you into its increasingly shocking improbabilities.
B00BQ1D7X4|5.0|Layne Staley...R.I.P<br /><br />He ain't ever coming back, that is like saying: \\"Damn, no John Bonham\\", it has been over 20 years from that death and with Staley it has been more than 15 years, get over it!<br /><br />This is Cantrell's band to begin with, Staley had the name, not the band.<br /><br />William Duvall hardly sings here, just vocal sharing on all songs on the album, still, this album is heavy. Sure, it is a tad long but...better having AIC's music around than lame bands of nowadays.<br /><br />My songs of choice are: \\"Pretty Done, Voices, Low Ceiling, Choke\\".<br /><br />Songs I disliked: \\"The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here, Lab Monkey\\".<br /><br />The album is awesome and good for them to keep on with the music.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|A real surprise ending I couldn't predict...worth reading tho disconcerting!  Well written and enlightening about the United states court system.
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|Must read.<br />A truly wonderful story. Love, action, and heartbreak. Easily in my top three favorite books of all time.
B004ADV552|4.0|Needless to say when this LP was re-issued in the 1960's it had completly different cover art. Several other Prestige sessions from 1950's were also given modernized art work in the 60's eg Jackie McLean's LIGHTS OUT. Not only that, they also switched the sides for SAXOPHONE COLOSSUS so that the 2 long tracks were on side 1 and the ballad in the 5th spot which seems to be the correct sequence. Now OJC with it's Original Jazz format has reverted to the original cover art and tune sequence uncorrecting the mistake that Prestige had corrected. - The two 1 star reviewers complain of distortion on Moritat on the later Concord RVG edition but my OJC 1'st CD edtion plays fine.

B009EEFTMC|5.0|I took a chance on this when it was the FAOTD and it's definitely a fun game.  I like the 3 dimensional aspect of the game, which helps to really helps to get you thinking on how to solve the puzzle.  Different modes of the game offer different challenges, with my favorite beign the one where you have to solve the matches as the cube continues to grow.  A good puzzle game, especially if you like Mahjong or other matching type games.

0385504209|5.0|Ten years ago, everyone was talking about the Da Vinci Code, the novel by Dan Brown where Harvard religious symbol expert Robert Langdon and Parisian cryptologist Sophie Neveu cracked a puzzle left by Sophie's estranged grandfather regarding the Holy Grail of the Roman Catholic faith.  Jacques Sauni&egrave;re, the grandfather, realized that he was going to take an important secret to the grave as the grandmaster of the Priory of Sion, when he learned that the three s&eacute;n&eacute;chaux who also knew the secret were killed that night.<br /><br />Neveu and Langdon embarked on a scavenger hunt through the Louvre, the renowned art museum in the heart of Paris, hunted by the Judicial Police, who believed Langdon was involved in the murders.  Our tour is not much more in-depth than the Louvre lite dash of millions of tourists, which includes visits to three famous paintings: the Mona Lisa, Venus de Milo, and Winged Victory.  The new glass pyramid entrance of the Louvre, designed by I.M. Pei, and the less-known inversed pyramid are also a part of the story.<br /><br />The scavenger hunt took the reader to a Swiss Depository Bank near the Rolland Garros tennis stadium, where one has to pass through the Bois de Boulogne, an area that sounds like the largest congregation of prostitutes in Europe.  Neveu and Langdon attract more attention at the depository, where a straight laced Swiss professional named Andr&eacute; Vernet believes the two have stolen a deposit by Sauni&egrave;re despite having the account number and the password to retrieve it.<br /><br />The hunt continued to a sprawling estate in the environs of Versailles called the Château Villette, a significant private estate owned by a British expert on the Holy Grail, Sir Leigh Teabing.  The name of the English knight of the novel is in itself an anagram of two real life names, Baigent and Leigh, who authored a book called Holy Blood, Holy Grail.  Brown used a summary of their work as part of the background for this novel.  Those two men had the nerve to sue Dan Brown for using their book as research material for his story, even though he mentioned it in the text, and used the findings of the book much like a novelist working on a story about the 1919 White Sox would use the book by Eliot Asinov for background material.<br /><br />At the Château, the trio was confronted by an angry albino monk.  Silas the monk is even angrier because he returned empty-handed from a trip to Saint-Sulpice, a cathedral with one of the most eccentric architectural histories in Paris.  This albino behemoth knew that Langdon and Neveu had the keystone because of a mysterious, but seemingly all-knowing man called The Teacher.  We later learn that the omniscient Teacher was actually aided by top-of-the-line surveillance equipment that even impressed operatives at the DCPJ.<br /><br />The hunt continued to London, in order to find A Knight A Pope Interred.  Neveu and Langdon visited the religious research center at King's College, the Templar Church, and Westminster Abbey.  They were looking for an orb that ought to be on the tomb of this knight.  In retrospect, the clue is simple, but such things seem so complicated in the bustle of the story.<br /><br />On the trip from Versailles to London, Sophie learned some truths about her family from Robert, who did not know the private Sauni&egrave;re, but did know about the religious ceremonies that disturbed Sophie so much that she cut off her relationship with her grandfather a decade ago.<br /><br />The three experts also discussed the Atbast cipher on the trip, which they needed to solve one of the puzzles of the clef de voûte.  Dan Brown used ciphers in previous novels, particularly Digital Fortress, so his use of the device in a plot involving a cryptographer was natural.<br /><br />The story was a remarkably interesting one that struck a chord with a lot of people.  Catholic scholars criticized the novel.  Some of these incensed scholars wrote rebuttals to the Da Vinci Code, much like [[ASIN:0451530802 Uncle Tom's Cabin]] of Harriet Beecher Stowe brought her a similar backlash over 150 years ago from Southern apostles of slavery.  My personal opinion is that millions read the Da Vinci Code, but few people changed their faith because they understand that this is a novel.<br /><br />If one digs deeper philosophically, the Catholic Church could learn from an underlying theme of the novel: that it has done more harm than good in covering up the human aspects of some of its members.  For instance, the Catholic Church could have handled the child abuse claims against some of its clergy better.  Those philosophical issues are interesting to think about, but the Da Vinci Code entertained people in many other ways in 2003.ke [[ASIN:0451530802 Uncle Tom's Cabin]] of Harriet Beecher Stowe brought her a similar backlash over 150 years ago from Southern apostles of slavery.

B00027JYLC|5.0|Film still stands up well today even though it was made in the 1930's.  Don't buy into the whole thing about it being so shocking it was banned for years unless you want to be disappointed...the &#34;shocks&#34; are very very tame for modern audiences.  The film is basically a morality tale-cute, litlle midget (Hans) falls in love with a regular sized gal and dumps his midget fiancee for her.  Alas, she is only after his money and conspires with her lover to murder him.  The circus performers find out about her plot in time to save poor Hans and they band together to seek revenge.  Very entertaining movie
B008BU75IQ|3.0|I have read all of Jeffery Archer's books starting years ago. He is an excellent writer, However, the situation he left the reader in at the end of &#34;Best Kept Secret&#34; is really unforgivable. I may never read one of his books again.
B0055PGUYU|4.0|An intriguing reference for anyone who is interested in learning how to understand why you do what you do.  Great insight.
1616614609|5.0|Netrunner is a great game for 2 players if you're a fan of strategy card games and so is your friend.<br /><br />This is the bare minimum of cards that could make the starter set. There are 7 factions in the box but the amount of cards for each and options available keeps deckbuilding with this box to a minimum. Game is still a 5 star game.<br /><br />However, there are expansions, but they nail you on the pricing. 5 of the 6 deck expansions in this &#34;cycle&#34; are out now (they release one / month), but those MSRP at $15/ea. This is reasonable pricing in the world of card games, but the starter box is cheap. Expansion packs are 20 unique cards x 3.<br /><br />So you got the starter set for $30 and you have a game, but the real fun starts when you buy the first cycle of expansions, and that's going to set you back $90.<br /><br />However, it's worth it. Game is fantastic.
B00BLCHYKU|1.0|story is stupid, thought there would be more to it.  There was nothing that really drew me in.  No likable characters.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I enjoyed the way the novel was arranged. The way a family reacts to tragedy and the support of each other throughout the book. I highly recommend it and look forward to reading more books by this author.
B009NY43NY|5.0|Many people have commented on their dissatisfaction with Charlaine Harris' final novel in the Sookie Stackhouse series, but I felt that she wrapped up many of the storylines. Whether or not you agree with the &#34;Happily Ever After&#34; resolution to Sookie's love life is immaterial. The fact is, people in our lives chose relationships we don't agree with all the time. It's their right to love whom they will. In the case of fictional characters, the vision is Ms. Harris' and even then, sometimes characters have a mind of their own. As far as complaints about plot holes and unlikely behavior, well, it's a Southern vampire mystery series. How much reality do you expect?
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Couldn't put this book down, it was really good and my first time to read books by this author but it will not be the last. I recommend this book.

193700788X|3.0|Predictable ending but disappointed in the lack of story. It seemed like Charlene tried to cram as many characters as she could into the book rather than develop a good storyline or focus on a conclusion to the ones that have kept readers interested all along. Should have been titled &#34;Eric Who?&#34;.

B00CW665VI|5.0|This book is different, but from the male POV it is as real and earth shatteringly funny and romantic.  You will not be disappointed.  Drew and Kate are lovable and fresh in their process to overcome, renew, accept and challenge each other to be better without trying too hard.  Emma Chase was on point.

0525478817|4.0|The whole time I read this I thought about the song springsteen by eric church. This book is very clever from the moment Hazel and Augustus Waters meet each other at the cancer support group you will be hooked. This is a rollercoaster of emotions, lots of sad parts and lots of funny weirdness too. Kind of like real life.Could really see the characters in my head like they were real.Love how the teenaged characters are not just angsty and weird, they think about deep things and plan picnics for each other and have really deep conversations. They are strong and love each other for better or worse, the way some adults can't even do. It is very cute some of the things they do because they are kids. Like gus , calls hazel hazel grace and sometimes has an unlit cigarette hanging out of his mouth. And hazel likes to give differant household objects human names.I liked the referance to V for Vendetta. I didn't know teenagers still watched that movie, Its comforting to know.I hope I am lucky to have a love half this awesome at some point in my life.It probably won't happen but would be nice.

B008602KQI|5.0|Having neer read the book, I have to say I found this film very entertaining.  It made me think though, what if this were to ever happen ..... would we allow our children to pay for our forefathers sins?
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|I have heard many good things about  south Korea, but hardly anything about the  people in the north.  After reading this my only hope is, now that first hand knowledge is out by this courageous young man, something, anything can be done. No one should have to live through what he and countless others have.  This book does not give a happy ever after ending, but it does give the reader honesty  and hope, My best wishes for his future and well done!
B00A7W29BE|5.0|I use this app everyday. I love this app so much THIS is my 1st review EVER. I scan receipts, documents, scrap pieces of paper anything I want to keep. It turns them into PDF's. Them you can choose to save it as black and white or color or do nothing and leave it just as you scanned it. Add tags, save multiple images as one file and many more thing I don't need to use right now but are super cool. I learned of this app and now everyone where I work use it for the expanse reports, snap a picture \\"PDF\\" and then send it via email to yourself or accounting and your done. Best FAOTD EVER...........<br />Thank you<br />Thank you<br />Thank you..............
B000PMLFRA|3.0|Shipment came on time as expected and the whole set is just gorgeous but, the movies are the versions that Lucas recently &#34;fixed&#34; and it just isn't the same as the originals.

B000IZ8SD8|5.0|I love Star Trek and had fun with this one. I have seen it a couple of times. It watches more like the television show rather than a movie, but I liked it.
B008133MDK|5.0|Very smart storyline and excellent acting. Would definitely recommend; you will not be disappointed. The only drawback is, there's only 3 per season.
B0051E9INK|2.0|Well, I liked this movie when I was a kid, but watching again it is rather dumb! The acting is horrible and the characters weak at best. Hate it when that happens :)
B0058YPG1G|5.0|Breaking Bad is awesome. Great acting all around. I'd recommend it to anyone. I watched most of them on Netflix and then bought them all on DVD. I can't wait for season 5 to come out on DVD and even better, for the 6th season to start back up for the last eight episodes!
B007SGM084|5.0|This has been one of best love stories that I have ever read. I didn't want it to end. Please Miss James write more. You are a wonderful story teller. I would love to know what Harper's after the second baby arrives.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Entertaining, fun. Like how it doesn't take too long for the hint button to recharge.<br />Cool graphics.  This was one of the better HO apps that I have played.
B008OM0EDO|5.0|This movie is definitely not for everyone. The dictator relies on perceptions of bigotry, where most of the jokes come from. Great movie
B00C2VIA52|5.0|5 stars, free, hours of game play . I enjoy it you will too. Down load it recommend it<br />. Again please play and have fun
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|Quell continues to keep us all entertained.  I loved the previous games and believe this one is even better. Get your thinking cap on and have a ball!
B004UNX1LS|5.0|Terrific audio/video of country music!  Easy to use and find what you're looking for.  Highly would recommend downloading this if you are looking for ways to view videos on your Kindle Fire.
B001H5X7I4|5.0|I think the first time I saw this movie, I couldn't stop laughing the entire time. For anyone who loves action/adventure films, this is a must-watch.<br /><br />The film arrived in a timely fashion and was not damaged in any way. I would purchase from this seller again.
B0061QD88S|5.0|Love this old classic.  Added it to my collection so will have for my grandchildren, while it is in the Disney Vault.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|It's an easy read but it's boring till the humping begins. It's pretty poorly written over all but this is coming from an English major. Over all and enjoyable read if your looking for non complicated erotica.
B00969PR18|1.0|First rattle out of the box, I tried to map a trip from Texas to Idaho. This app came back with an error message saying that it could not plan any route over 1,000 miles.<br />It immediately went into the trash, where it belongs.
B007ZYJMU8|2.0|SPEAKING OF ANGRY  THE MAN IS GETTING ON MY NERVES. I AM WATCHING A LITTLE AT A  TIME, HE DEPRESSES ME-- I WILL SEND ANOTHER REVIEW IF AND WHEN I FINISH WATCHING IT.
B005HSL626|5.0|You have to have a quick hand & eye coordination to play this game. I enjoy playing this on my IPhone & Kindle.
B0093X805W|5.0|We love watching Charlie & the Chocolate Factory both versions.  We hope to actually visit it in London with family when we can afford flying there, one day in the future.  It is incredible.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I am by no means an artist, but this game sure challenges my creativity. The only problem is finding people who will play better than 7 year old, lol.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|He the one person that's cool, intelligent,awesome ,smart ,he probably was in college for a long Time and probably got a good degree.  .  .<br />  By  Imani Vaughn. He's  1# best author.
B007REV4T8|5.0|Never a moment's disappointment; action-packed,suave, romantic  and sexy, as one expects. Great fun for fans of most ages- eighteen to a hundred!
B003ZDO04G|5.0|My daughter loves anything TinkerBell, so of course it was a hit. Now I think we have all Tink movies!
B0087ITBPC|5.0|It's  Barbara! What's not to love! Overbearing Mom and passive son combo a classic-sweet and a little funny, a little sad, but they both grow up and let go a little.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Really enjoyable, challenging. Highly recommend if you like any of the other G5 games. Keeps you on your toes and guessing. Good game.
B002GHHHKQ|5.0|This was purchased as a replacement for a lost copy on vhs! A classic, in our opinion. So happy to have it back in the library!
B000VSAEYI|2.0|I bought this for my son's 1st birthday party and I'm glad I bought it 2 months in advance since it leaked straight out of the box. After filling it with air and water the whole thing was deflated and empty of water an hour later. I would have been so angry had that occurred the day of the party. My return window has expired so I will be trying to patch it and hope that will work. It's very cute, but who cares if it doesn't work!<br /><br />Very disappointed!
B00A8MGIZG|3.0|This film tells a good story, but is formatted in constant flashes- forward and backward- that gave me a headache. I actually stopped in the middle for a break. Good premise, just overdone, in my opinion.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|It does what its supposed to do.  It also does it well.  Overall i would highly recommend purchasing this app.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|For dog lovers from a dog's point of view. This is a story of love, loyalty, and eternity. Enzo captured my heart. I could not put this book down. I laughed, cried, and so related to fighting the good fight and living a simple life. An unforgettable story!
0385738765|5.0|Couldn't put the book down had to read it as soon as it came! I just love James Dashner's books.

B008Y73940|4.0|It held our interest and didn't drag. It's not an academy award winner, edge of your seat movie, but certainly enjoyable and worth a viewing.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It's really good for my daughter when she needs to do math homework. It has every thing you need. I read comments to make use  it's good and it is so I'm making a comment for you to know. Thanks.
B00AAX68HG|4.0|This is an enjoyable game that makes me think in different ways. I like the different pudding monsters and their different moves.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Love it love all the books but I have not yet finished it ! I recommend that you read The Wheel of Time from book One and keep going
B009ME47H2|2.0|What a disappointment. The recording procedure is fine, but why bother if you can't hear the playback? I deleted it immediately.
0060853972|5.0|The book is funny beyond words. Everything that every religion teaches gets trampled on in the most hilarious of ways. The 4 motorcyclists of the apocalypse? Come on, if you don't find that funny I'm not sure how much how there is for you!
B008602KQI|5.0|this movie is one of my favorites and i will watch it over and over agian. I recomend this movie for anyone who loves survival and action.
B0012DP8A6|5.0|Saw origonal with Jack Nickelson, but this remake is much superior to the first one.<br />If anyone is into Cult Movies then Little Shop is for you. Enjoy
B00BU18U82|2.0|Too hard to control tractors or combines.  Would be more fun if it was easier to control the turning of the vehicles.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Even though i saw the movie first, the book made me not to stop reading and it was really satisfied at the end!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is fab, me and my family love it, would definitely recommend it. It is every thing you look for in a good app, download it now,because it is great.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is one of the best series I have ever watched.  It is completely addicting and the acting is better than movie quality
B00AECDDYY|4.0|I thought it was going to be more open world like age of empires but instead was more like angry bird levels. Nonetheless it was a good game. Entertaining and requires strategy.
B005C8ENI0|5.0|This movie is a really good - lots of twists and turns - The title is overkill since there wasn't much Lincoln in the movie.
B00CHI5F5S|1.0|Poor acting, too much yelling and poor transitions between scenes.  A waste of time watching.<br />Save your $$$$  Instead watch Inn of 6 Happiness
B003L77FYS|5.0|received and watched and was thrilled with it - i am an avaid fan of castle and think its one of the best on tv  jean a
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I chose 5 stars because I like the fast racer car. I also like the tank because it can go up anything. And I think my dad would like it to
B003F3NDWG|5.0|i have enjoyed all of the castle dvd's i have received - my favorite show - castle and becket are great together  jean a
B00C2VIA52|5.0|This game so far has been really excellent so far and has like similarities in that of a magic the gathering set up. Only complaint is how hard leveling up is once you reach Lv 10
B005COO1X6|4.0|Kept me interested the entire time! Great characters and story. A little scary if you travel a lot! I would recommend this book!
B003G4W49C|5.0|O my goodness this book was superb. It kept me up long into the night! (Reading it.) This was not a problem of course because it's summer so there's no schoolwork I have to concentrate on and because this book is awesome. Better than the hunger games, in my personal opinion. I began this book on a Wednesday and finished it on the following Friday. This book was a total joy to read so it's a 5 star from me.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|It has a ton of levels you can play and cars but they cost a lot but you can get a bunch of money in 1 play its just amazing
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is amazing I could play it all day long. I'M really exited for the update but you should totally get this game. If you are a beginner it's confusing but just ask a friend ho  to do stuff
1432794426|5.0|The most beautiful, in-depth portrait of Michael Jackson that I've read!  In researching and writing this book, Karen Moriarty has given a magnificent Gift to those who love Michael, and those who want to better understand him.  This book is no less than a Gift to the Planet.<br /><br />I've read most of the major books about Michael (many of them wonderful, for various reasons). _Defending a King_ was the most grounded, yet it lost no aspect of the emotion or intensity  surrounding Michaels life and death -- and his Spirit that lives on with us.  It offers the most in-depth, moving, and captivating portraits of Michael Jackson -- in life and in death -- his private joys and his deep, life-long suffering as a human being.  A beautifully written and moving accounting and analysis. The respect this author shows for Michael touched me deeply.<br /><br />My most high recommendation for this particular book as one to be read by anyone who wants a deeper understanding of Michael Jackson and the unfathomable contribution he made to the Planet and to Humanity.
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|This game is awesome im pman_3 and i like it you would to just hit download and your are in for a world of fun hope you enjoy it
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This was the best game that I have ever played. I could not pull myself away from the game until I had played it all, 10 hours straight and worth every second
B007MDB71O|5.0|We need to show support for this movie so that Disney will complete the trilogy.  Now I need to reread the books and compare.  LOL
B00CWV8X04|5.0|Very good movie, lots of twists and turns,<br />Great ending, well worth the time and great acting<br />Check it out
B00BY9GQHM|4.0|If you like object search games this one is packed full of them.  The plot is a little boring.  I will also try Letters from Nowhere 2.
B001TH8UUA|5.0|This HDMI cable is at least as good as any of the other HDMI cables I own and it cost a fraction of their prices.  I am very happy with this purchase.
B004T5K3OK|4.0|This is the handiest tool I have on my Android now.  When away from the office I can scan my receipts and email them to myself so I have a digital record for my expense report.  I would highly recommend this app.
B00785P2QC|4.0|its a good game. so good that I'm commenting just to get the extra points that they give when you do this. the only thing that I dont like is how you have to connenct to facebook. but overall its good you'll  enjoy it!
B004T5R2HQ|4.0|Great it a lot.  I would recommend it to anyone that needs to scan documents while away from the office.
B0001MDP3G|5.0|I had to re-purchase this because the first time around I bought the wrong code dvd..and of course anything that Charlie Hunnam is in is excellent. I just wish there was more outtakes with him or interviews.
B003VXMMTK|5.0|It is a beautiful film and true to the book. I enjoyed reading the book very much and was afraid the film would be a disappointment, but it wasn't. Both the book and the film are gems.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|The people who cancelled this show blew it they did not watch it. The show should have ran for a years not just one had a lot of stories left in it and would have just gotten better.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Sandberg has used her positionof prominence to provoke a critical conversation.  Good reading for both men and women.  Highly recommended.
B009NOVCTM|5.0|Starting with their very first released recording &#34;Come on&#34; this compilation (with their two never released 2012 songs) this is a great overview of the best work from this legendary band. Try &#34;Get your Ya Yas Out&#34; and &#34;Forty Licks&#34; to experience their live sound.
B0081336FO|5.0|Wasn't too sure in the beginning, but after watching all the episodes, I keep wondering if that's all there is, or will there be more.  Love the way Sherlock is played.........love all the characters.  Have always been a Sherlock fan from way back, and especially love this rendition.  When does the new season begin?
B0002V7O3S|5.0|i love this movie its like a dream i hand win i wuse young its so scare and real thank you.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|its always updating and is super fun. the one drop back is that when you have it in the best picture resolution it starts to lag
B00APUYWYA|5.0|You'll find yourself singing the songs all the time. such a great, feel good movie. You'll want to watch it over and over again.
B000EGF0NW|5.0|Alice  won my Heart in this book, from the start of her young life I saw just how strong her mind is to go thought all the hell & come out a Star!!  I love all her books & You will too!!!
B009NY43NY|5.0|I'm sooo sad this is the last book in the series! The ending to this series did not disappoint me.
B0097HSS4M|4.0|Easy to use, lots of options. Links with social networks very easily, I love it. I use it almost every day. Absolutely wonderful app.
B0015AARJI|5.0|i ordered this for my husband and the kids.  they swear upon these remotes, no other works or lasts as well.  so far its living up to its rep.  we love it
B0074MZSWW|4.0|The Alabama Shakes has captured raw soul and turning into their own unique sound. I feel this is just the start for this break out band. The tracks reflect a wide range of hard core in uor face good feeling vibes that catapults into you into immediately wanting more! I can' t wait for their next project and I hope to see yhem perform live soon.
B008L5G4I8|5.0|Have read this book many times.  Am now converting to ebooks, and look forward to reading it again many times.
B0064W652A|5.0|Great Arc and great art. There is no reason I should be forced to write minimum amount of words to tell people I loved the book
B000OWC2QE|4.0|Photography was very beautiful.  Lots of interesting information about sea life.  Great way to introduce something educatonal to the whole family.  Lots of cute little critters.
B00992CF6W|5.0|My eight year old thinks this game is awesome and super cool. Just wishes that it could download more mods.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|This is just one of those books I loved reading and didn't want to end. I love the idea of someone who is so at a loss in life and chooses to do one big thing in the hopes of turning their life around. One young woman's journey to hike the Pacific Crest Trail is the thread through out the story. If you want to be transported when you read then this book will do that. I am not a real outdoorsy type but I love Jon Krakauer books and now I can add this to the list. It's really about the struggles in life and how we deal with them and sometimes how we let them drag us down. It is an uplifting tale and one I will recommend again and again.
B0051BVQFG|5.0|I could honestly care less about the storyline aspect of the movie, I mainly watched this movie a billion times just to see this situation and how the world and these marines would respond to a alien invasion, this movie is also very inspiring.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|I just so happening to be looking at my grandson play this app on my kindle and saw that the surf board he was going to choose he had to pay a 1.00 for and since he is 6yrs old and I did not feel like sitting there watching to make sure nothing else popped up I deleted the app
B00AB7HESI|4.0|When I got this app I did not want to put it down. The reason I did not like it is because you have to pay for the other worlds. The rest of it is fine. You should get this app!
B0011EVSGE|5.0|I grew up watching this and one day want do remake of this filming myfrom own production following the same story. It is such a well made movie. The Best.
B005C0DHEY|3.0|Informative, but many questions remain. It's a one sided documentary, that shows the many negatives of fracking, but it fails to mention any postives.
B001F8W400|5.0|Same as above and I would love to see Speed racer returns. You gotta love as you should see it
B00B2166BS|5.0|Must have for any Nexus 10 owner! The cord is the same length as the stock USB cable that comes with the N10
B009MYARIK|4.0|Not as good as some of her others, but I did like the story line. I would have liked a little more wrap up at the end.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love Downton Abbey.  From the very first episode of the first season, I was hooked.  Very well done, and excellent story lines.  I love following every character.  Actors are fabulous.

B0055B7IPE|5.0|I enjoyed watching this movie.  Very well done, colorful, good story line, captivating, and geared more toward the older crowd.
B00BQI4AU6|5.0|I am blown away at all the great songs here! Tom hasnt missed a beat, not quite Long Cold Winter blues mixed with Shelter Me style rockers, great ballads....Dang ,to bad it took so long. Can't get it out of cd player......Brings a permanent smile !!!Rod Stewart flavored Flower Song, Cinderella style rockers,Solid Ground, It's Not Enough,Cold Day In Hell,Mood Elevator. Welcome To My Mind Is dark  like Talk Is Cheap. 4 killer ballads....AWESOME !!!
B000SCHBGQ|5.0|An easy quick read that I couldn't put down.  Awesome book<br />I can't wait to read the others in the series
B005LAII1C|2.0|The description said blueray and DVD but it was only blueray. Not a big deal but not the total truth.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Good clear App but delivers malwear and my anti-virus software suggested I get rid of it.It was good until I got the bad news.
B0018OFN1S|5.0|It was great I love Vin he rocks. The cars are tricked out and pretty custom. The racing keeps you on the edge!
B001AQR3JY|5.0|just what I ordered great movie and will be kept for my grandchildren and great grandchildren so that they will all get to se Lion King
B002RUA54W|2.0|This novel have been give reviews like &#34;humorous&#34;, &#34;a smashing love story&#34;, &#34;will be read with pleasure a hundred years from now&#34;... For every page turned I awaited the story to really get going. Instead, another thorough description of outfits, ambience in the dining room and dos and dont´s were presented. To me, the main caracter never came through and got me involved in her story. I finished the book but would not recommend it. There are way to many great reading experiences out there.
B00669MFA2|5.0|Disclaimer: Do not rent or buy this without having seen at least the deathly hallows part 1 (ideally you will want to watch the entire series). This movie is not a standalone movie. If you do happen to rent this without having seen the others this movie will be confused the entire time.<br /><br />With that being said this movie is a great way to end the series. It's a heartfelt movie that surround major themes of friendship and love. Expect a few tears shed. This movie has tons of magic (literally and figuratively).
B00CS7ZIHI|5.0|I love it! The lyrics, the instrumentals, the sound....AmAzInG!!!  Their music just grows with every release.  \\"Birth\\" is my favorite!
1596354208|3.0|The designs were okay, but I really was expecting a little more.  When I was in Alaska, I saw tatted jewelry made by the local artists.  I was hoping to see something more along that line. It's okay, but just missing the wow factor I was looking for.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Couldn't put it down! Some of the imagery made it into my dreams. It was intense, poignant, and ultimately hopeful - Looking forward to more from Mr. Howey.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I do not think I would recommend this product.  I like it only for keeping in touch with people I love and information from a fewsights.
B00821PCJS|4.0|Great series, very excited to see the start of a new season. Just wish it was on hulu plus, but hopefully soon.
B00009W0WM|4.0|If you watch this movie over and over, you'll want this two disk special. It has the explanation of how and why film made plus incite  to the actors. Just don't make excellent movies like this any longer.
0689835604|5.0|My grand baby loves it.  Very creative and stimulating for a baby from six months up to about 18 months
B005GY0Y8S|5.0|There was plenty to like about this book.  The settings, the characters, the mystery.  I really loved this mystery novel.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|This is the best app ever for making customized meditation music. I use this all the time with the added bonus of being able to listen to my meditation while I do other things on my kindle fire hd.  It is incredibly simple to use: choose your sounds and the volume of each for a different experience every time.  I jumped on this when it I saw it was the free app of the day..however, upon using it, It most certainly is worth the couple bucks.  You will be happy, so just do it.
B002QYSZBO|5.0|Shane Black shows his dark and elegant humor masterfully in an excellent outing by Robert Downey Jr and Val Kilmer. Downey. In his triumphant return to the big screen performs masterfully as a second-rate thief who finds am opportunity to resume the life he thought lost in childhood. Kilmer proves he still has it as a gay detective with sharp wit and keen street sense. An absolute must-see for viewers with a love of noir and clever writing.
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|It was very fun to read, the characters made you laugh a whole lot, and there were many hilarious events in the story too
B003Y5H5EW|5.0|This is an excellent movie. Keeps you on your feet and wanting more. I have all of the underworld movies, and I really like this one.
B0055S348W|1.0|I dl'd this when it was the free app of the day a while back, and it was working fine for a 6 months. Today I updated it and it just says &quot;Error&quot; when I hit print!!! WTF!!
B0076DELIG|5.0|Harry Bosch uses his own style to again clean up the filth of the criminal element, and to try to clean up his own life as he goes along.
B00138J1XK|5.0|I love the classic sounds of the older songs. This is one that is even used as a theme song for the TV series, SUPERNATURAL.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Another wild ride with Pendergast from the pens of Preston and Child.  The action is non-stop with a different turn around every corner.
B009NY43NY|5.0|One of the best Sookie books yet!  If you are a fan of the series it's a must-read! Very satisfying...
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game every fun and it pass time so quickly...I'm so addicted. This game is very great with my kindle.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Well written, followed the many layers of characters, but not as captivating as the Pillars series. Went off on tome boring tangents in England and France.
B003FL4O9E|5.0|We watch it over and over and over again in our house. It has some really funny parts that get the whole family laughing.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I stumbled this app as the &#34;app of the day&#34; at amazon. Thrilled I found it. Love it, and especially that it has a timer. I set it for 30 minutes at night, fall asleep listening to great sounds,usually river, but there are lots...and the app stops and turns itself off automatically. Doesn't seem to drain battery, either.
0345803485|3.0|Go to the library or borrow the book from a friend. There are better books out there if you want to read about sex!  I wouldn't spend the money on it!
B000JMKRKC|4.0|Very enjoyable.......ke in the future.eps you interested till the very end! Hope this author will write more for us all to enjoy
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|Several people have thanked me profusely  for telling them about this book.  Men love it, women love it...everyone loves it.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|I enjoyed this book immensely! It was well written- inspirational, funny, informative and intelligent. I was never a runner until I read it, but this book has actually changed my life
B003O86FMW|5.0|I cannot say enough about Ms. Collins talents in creating a world and characters that are so intriguing.  I thoroughly enjoyed this second book.  I would recommend this book to anyone who likes adventure and a storyline that keeps you up late reading.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book is really good.  The entire series is a must read.  I found myself not being able to wait to get the next book and just downloaded it. When I finished the series I felt like I just watched the series finale and kinda felt bummed that there was no more...
B00B2166BS|5.0|If you have the Nexus 10, it is worth the money to save time in the charging process!  I definitely would recommend!
B00BY8DFRW|3.0|This album-to me-was exactly the reflection of it's name-after listening to it for three days in a row-I have asked myself the same question-Now What- or to be more precise-What Now-sincerely speaking-this masterpiece of an attempt left me untouched.Being a DP fan from beginning of times-I felt like nothing really happened.This album could be made by any other classic rock master...Talking about pressing-EU pressing I've got is pretty lousy,noisy,sounds very flat and reminds me the Beatles vinyl re-masters flop.
B00003CX9E|4.0|This was bought as a gift for someone else.  I thought it was pretty well done for its time.  Orson Welles is outstanding in it.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Awesome graphics and intriguing storyline.  Takes me back to the old school carnivals.  Definitely a game to try if you enjoy hidden object and puzzle games!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The least strong of all the Hunger Games series, but still a great book.  The whole series is so original and just an entertaining blast to read.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|This is an excellent read for those who like historical novels.  The character and story development is superb.  If you are planning a long flight or traveling of any kind it is a very good companion.  I will read the entire trilogy as I believe Ken Follett has done it again and has done it quite well.
B001MTENOC|5.0|OMG!  I cannot say how much I loved this book.  I am always on a spiritual quest for something new or different.  This book was about case studies of souls In Between Lives, and what they do and learn and how they progress on the other side.  Wow!  Loved it.  Totally intend to get the next book either on kindle or in published book form.
B004J09ONG|5.0|What an amazing movie !!! Everyone should watch this great classic - it is a timeless masterpiece . A must for all animal lovets
B00003CXB2|3.0|I bought this as a gift for someone.  The person I bought it for loved it.  I hated it.  So, I gave it 3 stars as a happy medium.  For me, it was long, tedious and took forever to get anywhere.
B00594XOZU|5.0|Kik messenger is the best texting app because u can send pictures from your gallery and take pictures then send them. You can find other people that u may know on kik and talk to them. You can change your color chat bubbles. It's FREE! would recommend kik to anyone who likes to text ppl and have fun with it!
B003O86FMW|5.0|LOVED IT!  The whole series is fantastic.  Loved all the books and hated that they were over when I finished!!  What a crazy, fantastic idea for a series!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I used to be so scared of death, even as a Christian. However, reading this book 'Proof of Heaven' has terminated every fear of death in me. I say this because I am a Christian and will go to heaven in the after life. The author uses easy and down-to-earth explanations of his points which make the book an easy read.<br /><br />I also strongly recommend the following book [[ASIN:B00CTSNP4Y 7 Attributes That Can Make or Break You]]
B0071XO8RA|3.0|There were parts of this story that seemed really interesting, but it dragged in alot of places, took forever to go anywhere and frankly just bored me in the end.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I like this app. Nice big numbers and you can adjust the brightness. First one I found. Only one I need. A must have!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|One of the most original books ever.  What a premise!!  A lottery for kids to fight to the death!  I totally loved it.
B003G94BZC|5.0|Although I will miss Tennant as being the Doctor, Smith does a great job with coming after such brilliant acting from Tennant.
B00COHAUD4|4.0|Great movie. The kids were amazing. Good plot and a ending that was unexpected. Thanks again Amazon, your movie selection is great.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|Great game! Works perfect for kindel fire. Takes time to get the armors though. Other than that its nice to play.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Great movie. I know its older but I hadn't seen it and was delighted to watch it. Thanks again amazon.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|All my favorite Marvel heroes (except X-Men) and great computer effects!  I've watched it several times, so buying it rather than renting it was a good choice.
B00CWV8TIU|4.0|Good movie. Excellent acting. Not the outcome I thought was coming. I would watch this again. Thanks Amazon for having good picks.
B004Z2TUGE|4.0|Not really top level sci-fi and too much teen angst, but the story was interesting and the bad aliens were well played.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|even better than the first season, I love this show and cannot wait for the third season to air this fall.
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|Great Tom Cruise character; I hope to see another story with him as Jack Reacher.  I have seen this one twice and it holds up on re-showing very well.
B00BSW6F26|1.0|It was way to short even for only 99¢. If you go to youtube and look it up one of the videos ( the 12+ minute one) you can watch the entire game!
B00AG297GK|3.0|Faintly amusing in parts - not very original. Having watched previous Sacha Cohen moves I awaited this with keen anticipation - in the end with only a few laughs I was left somewhat disappointed.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This is a very good game and is very addictive. It has many challenges and test your skills. I love this game!
B0012PDVQ2|5.0|Though I first saw this movie ages ago I have never forgotten the dismal smoggy look of the city.  It is so sad to see our world turning into this, slowly but steadily.  Now we have drones instead of replicants but who knows.  A haunting movie.
B006964E8S|3.0|It as so gruesome to start with, I certainly didn't find it gripping,  it took me a while to get into it.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I finally broke down and started watching this series and I was immediately hooked.  I'm a bit of an Anglophile and enjoy historical fiction so, forget about it!  I will be neglecting many responsibilities to get caught up on this show.  The acting is superb and it is beautifully shot too.  Highly recommend.
B0095MVOMC|5.0|I have planned a number of these puzzles; they are quite challenging and a lot of fun. Would strongly recommend.
B003O86FMW|5.0|A good read catching more one on one dialog than first book, great action scenes. Not a great place to end a book.  I have read all three this is the best of the three.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|It is cute. The kids love building the reef. B threes been so Meryl vertigo mixed seven juices logged back often think defying.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Another great thriller with many twists and turns until the the very end.  Vince Flynn has continued to keep me totally engaged.
B0000DBJDM|5.0|I love this movie because the music is fantastic and you get to see the Pink Floyd in the studio recording The Dark Side of the Moon. I would recommend this movie to any PF fan. The only dislikes I hear about this movie is that the Directors Cut altered too much and the original is better but you get both versions on this DVD.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|The feel of this show was wonderful.  The actors blended well. The stories were interesting. The imagination by the author was expressed well.  It was probably too much for main stream tv and the banal expectation that accompanies it.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This ap is absolutely amazing! There are so many devotional plans to choose from and love that you can change the settings and pick different versions of the Bible. So thankful to Pastor Craig Groeschel for this!
B008EKMB82|5.0|Ozeki's book has it all...global warming, tsunamis, zen Buddhist nuns, writer's block,  bullying, kamakazi pilots in WWII and more. The potential for being overwhelmed by it all is there, but Ozeki's skill and deft handling of each thread is amazing. She puts a unique spin on every topic she addresses. It is one of a handful of books I've read where I slowed my reading near the end. I wanted it to continue!
B006S08RLU|1.0|I didn't watch it on the amazon player because it never worked. I feel like this is the second time that I attempted to watch a movie on amazon's player and it was a no go. Can I have my money back?
B00BDSRKHO|5.0|Brilliant recording - agree with other reviewer - much better then HOM - however the vinyl is OLD THICK WAX - the sound is amazing.  Digital is flat, this is full.  It is amazing that they make this music so well today after so many years, whilst Depeche Mode do boring dirges and Human League made a credo of a mess.  BUY VINYL!
B0076DELIG|4.0|I belong to a book club for writers. We read books about the craft and in different genres. I'm not much of a mystery buff, but I enjoyed The Black Box for the writing and the story. The writing was clear and had a good balance of police work and Harry's personal issues. The plot was twisted enough without being out of the realm of reality. It helps that I live in California - years in LA and in San Francisco East Bay, so I am familiar with all the sites Harry Bosch frequented. And I liked the character of Harry Bosch - a man of my generation. He is a character I can root for. I will read more Harry Bosch mysteries.
1449410243|5.0|I couldn't resist (gently) reading this before wrapping it and handing it to my brother for his birthday. I'm not sure which one of us got a bigger laugh out of it! :)
B000FQIRXQ|5.0|I just love this!  Some Dickens novels I read first, then check out the movies, but some I watch first so I can have a picture in my mind of the characters and places, and then enjoy the nuances and details of Dickens' depiction.  This one I've watched several times without reading the novel yet, and it's one of my favorites ever.  Tom Wilkinson narrates Dickens' semi-autobiographical tale (an \\"exaggerated\\" and \\"edited\\" version of his life, we could call it), Daniel Ratcliffe plays the young David, Bob Hoskins as Mr. Macawber, Maggie Smith as Betsy Trotwood...what's not to like?  And the rest of the characters and settings are just right too.  As a Christian, the icing on the cake for me is Dickens' propensity for illustrating God's sovereign providence, even over evil acts and persons, which causes \\"all things to work together for good.\\"  Some critics have said too many coincidences come together in Dickens to be believable, but I believe like he did that it happens all the time, though we may not see it from our limited vantage point. The fictional narrator is able to see it, however, so we can too as we watch the events unfold through his eyes. An example is the terrific scene where Miss Trotwood tells off Mr. Murdstone and his sister, saving David from a fate worse than death.  She can \\"peg\\" the abusive husband because she endured one herself in the past, and she has the passion and resolve to stand up to him for the same reason.  The hand of providence used her past misfortune to insure a bright future for David, and provide a greater measure of redemption and meaning for her own life as well.
0375423966|5.0|This is an incredible tale which could sound tragic in places, but comes out so much more light-hearted than one might expect. The format obviously has something to do with it, although the drawings are sometimes ominously dark and brooding; after all, it's hard to take a graphic novel too seriously, isn't it?<br />Her story is engaging and exciting, told with a beautiful and witty tongue.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I have downloaded a few different &#34;white noise&#34; type applications, but this one is most definitely different.  I love that I can mix whatever melodies or sounds I want to make a great combination of relaxing music.  The combinations are limitless!  I would definitely recommend!
1609419693|5.0|If you enjoyed reading this book, I HIGHLY recommending also buying, borrowing, renting, or somehow finding a copy of the audio book as well. You will love hearing Tina Fey recount her own story, complete with that particular audio snippet from SNL... :)<br />But don't take my word for it: she won a GRAMMY for her highly entertaining reading. :)
B00BQHA06A|5.0|Great band do them a favor and support these guys so they can do what we like sooo much. Buy it
B007W8S2MG|5.0|I never cared enough to write a review for anything except this game. Ever. First off, if you're not interested in the game because you don't like anime or Japanese style games, that's silly. Sadly I know someone who is exactly like this and doesn't like this game or games like it for really stupid reasons as such. Please give this game a chance...not only because it's seriously one of the top rated games I've ever seen rated by users on amazon or anywhere really, but because it truly is a one of the best games made.<br /><br />I beat this game in 15 days. I played for 81 hours and 42 minutes in that time frame. (even more.. not counting when I died early on and redid a part and reloading certain days and making different choices and such) I played this more than little kid me when I played Pokemon Red/Blue or Gold/Silver. That's honestly saying a lot. My sleep schedule was so beyond messed up by the time I was done with this game. I was staying up until about 6:30 in the morning playing. And you know what...I don't regret any of it. None of it wasn't worth every second I played this game.<br /><br />From the extremely memorable characters to the extremely catchy soundtrack to the extremely funny dialogue to the extremely fun gameplay and captivating story...well you get my point. I know that I will remember so many aspects of this game throughout my life even if I don't play the game ever again (which will be unlikely to be honest).<br /><br />This game had such a positive impact on my life that I would have never thought was possible from just a game. It deals with many different themes in life in general that are pretty much relateable to just about anyone. Although, after I beat the game, I felt really empty and I can't get myself to play anything else, but I'm sure that will eventually go away. I just seriously never would have thought a game could impact me this much, but when I played P4G I was so sucked into it and I loved every moment of it.<br /><br />I cried 3 times throughout the game and honestly I haven't cried as much as I did in the past 10 years or so. Maybe it might be a stupid thing to some people or maybe other people who played didn't get the same reaction as me, but still if a game can affect me that much, it just goes to show how memorable and how much care and effort was made into making this game.<br /><br />Although I never played the original, this was recommended by my friend who had played the original for the ps2 (thanks Robert again immensely) and from what I can tell it seems certain things were changed that some people like and some people don't. That's pretty much the same with everything though. But the amount of extra content that was added and extra voicing and everything else they added in showed that this game was not just a traditional port, and was quite an expansion.<br /><br />Please please give this game a chance. From the ratings you can already tell that most people really enjoy it as much as I did, so please give it a chance if you're given the opportunity. I have never played a game that impacted me so much before, and I seriously love this game and it definitely was worth buying. Hell, I would even recommend getting a vita just for this game...which is ironic because I have 5 other games  for the vita and I still want to play NG+ instead of playing a different game. I honestly loved it that much.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|While most of the John Corey Novels are loaded with twists, turns and action, &#34;The Panther&#34; takes it up a notch with historical facts about the middle east, Yemin and the USS Cole bombing. This component added another dimension to a novel I really enjoyed and think you will, too.
B005EGXTL2|5.0|had me hooked from the start so  I had to read the trilogy.<br />Drawn into the characters, love, hate, sorrow betrayal the lot.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Easy to configure and use.  It's nice to have access to primary location weather and others of interest at the touch of a key.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|I just started this game cause my girlfriend wanted me to play it, I didn't think it was going to be so addicting, it's a pretty awesome game :P
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is so fun if I could only have one game on my kindle fire it would be my horse because it is so fun and you have a instructor to help you best game ever
B003TH14H4|5.0|Just as good as Season 1. A nice 45 minute break every evening or so! Almost like the &#34;Thin Man&#34; in reverse.
B00D2K40WY|3.0|same as wedding salon just... princesses. even the same people. not the best game in my opinion plus you need to buy if you want the full expirience.
B0043WDK2G|5.0|Still enjoying it a lot.  All the characters come alive. Good acting. Very good characters and interesting (make sense) stories.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I'm wasn't a reader until I read this book. It was so real nothing fake or too good to be true. I recommend you read this
B00COGY2P2|5.0|Really enjoyed this. Standard Tom Cruise movie with good story lots of action.  Very well produced, very suspenseful and fast paced.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I really enjoyed it, I thought things were tied up nicely. I always thought Sam and Sookie should end up together
B0055S348W|2.0|Had the premium version for about a year after the last update I can't print from my galaxy s3 to my hp anymore I get just the word error after selecting print.  I reinstalled the app and no luck.  Any know what to do
B003ODIZL6|5.0|All the words you could imagine. The best dictionary and it is touch screen. Really easy to kind stuff. Try it for your self. The best
B00B8WXG9G|2.0|I listened to this several times and do not like the sound of the songs.  I liked the choices of the songs but not how they sounded.
B008JFUORW|3.0|I was hoping &#34;Hangover 3&#34; would be a remake of 1 and 2 when Alan (Zach Galifianakis) avers &#34;I will never change.&#34; For those who complained that &#34;Hangover 2&#34; was too much like the original...be careful what you ask for.<br /><br />This film builds upon the events from the first film for plot and humor. Our threesome must capture Leslie Chow (Ken Jeong) or else Doug (Justin Bartha) will be killed by crime boss Marshall (John Goodman). Goodman revives his famous potty line from the &#34;Branded&#34; scene of &#34;The Big Lebowski&#34; which might go unnoticed among the 100 or so F-bombs dropped in the film.<br /><br />The plot was boring compared to the other two features. This film relies on the delivery of over the top jokes from Zach Galifianakis which incorporates bizarre dark humor. Without this, the film is a bust. Good use of classic rock lyrics incorporated into the film.<br /><br />No need to rush out and see this on the big screen.<br /><br />Parental Guide: Excessive F-bombs. No sex. Brief nudity(?)
B00821PCJS|5.0|Glad they are bringing this show back !  An exciting series on TV  Look forward to the return and hope they do not take it off this time
B0054SMIH6|5.0|I have just started to read Michael C's books and I found this one! Awesome movie couldn't stop watching! Just wish they would make a movie of the black box!
B003UBTX7C|5.0|I read the whole series and loved it,never read anything like it before. I hope he writes more on the camel club!!!
B000SEI230|5.0|Made mistake of watching the movie before reading the book. There is a huge difference between the two in my opinion. Book is much better and has more meaning from spending my summer's as a child in Beaufort.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|It was a textbook put to life - in a good way.  I loved how the author, a neuroscientest I believe, showed the rapid progression of early onset Alzheimer's as well as the various reactions from friends and family members.  It was heartwarming and scary at the same time.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|this app works great I used all the other battery monitors and by far this was the best it is everything you want in an app like this
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|Shooting, diving, and the best quality graphics the most enjoyable portable first person shooter. Both hero and villan with hilarious comments from the villan. Buy it and multiplayer is fun too
B00992CF6W|5.0|Its It's awesome  that they have tnt in minecraft and on the free version  on the Ipad3 it does not have tnt.
B0080BFWE0|5.0|Don't watch this movie if you don't have a good sense of humor. It's silly and in some places, cheesy. But, if you just want some entertainment and some nostalgia (the 80s!!!!!), then this movie is a good time. Watch it with your bestie!
B004DK5CW4|5.0|This movie is inspirational.  I watch this movie when I am having trouble achieving a goal.  I love the faith and determination the characters show while trying to achieve their goal.  It is motivational.  Watch it.  I am sure you will fall in love with it too.
B004Q3RDUW|5.0|As well as an eye-opener to another culture, this book is a great example for many things:  Unconditional love, patience, respect and the lack of, war and the reality of war from the perspective of the civilian.  Also, the unending hardship and sacrifice that loyalty can bring.  Loyalty to one's cuture, loyalty to one's child, loyalty to a friend.  And all this through the eyes of women.
B000LXQVA4|5.0|I have both the [[ASIN:B003LQQGE4 Baby Einstein Musical Motion Activity Jumper, Blue]] and the [[ASIN:B000LXQVA4 Fisher-Price Rainforest Jumperoo]]. We needed two jumpers so I just bought both for variety but if I had to only buy 1 jumper, it would definitely be the Fisher Price. My baby LOVES the Rainforest Jumperoo. He laughs, squeals and jumps like crazy in it. He loves all the spinning thingies, the alligator and the sun.  He loves the elephant, monkey and the parrot in the front.  The parrot is definitely the favorite!  Hasn't figured out how to pop out the tiger yet.  Loves grabbing the blue frog.  He plays with each and every thing as he rotates around.  He is just so happy in this thing.<br /><br />In case you are debating which one of the 2 to get...... The Baby Einstein is definitely not as jumpy and the seat is not as snugly so I have to stuff some blankets in his back. I believe this affects the jumpiness of the jumper, the huge gap in the seat. So the Baby Einstein is basically like an exersaucer but it is better than a [[ASIN:B007IV17PQ Baby Einstein Baby Neptune Activity Center]], for instance, because you can switch out the toys. The Baby Einstein has those 2 arches and 6 loops. You can also attach even more toys with those plastic links such as [[ASIN:B008IT76AW Infantino Ring-A-Links Teether Set]]. I have switched out toys so many times as my baby grew. I didn't use the toys that it came with because they are not BPA free. I took off the sun and the cloud because he kept licking it. I didn't use any of the detachable little toys that it came with. I replaced everything with BPA free and organic toys. Obviously I left the piano and spinner but hey, you do what you can. Every little bit helps. So I would definitely recommend both. The Fisher Price as a jumper and the Baby Einstein as an exersaucer. I do put pillows underneath both because we have hardwood floors and I noticed that my baby's pinky toes would bleed when he jumped too hard.
B0019TSI8W|4.0|Just like an old classic.  Beautiful music, great actors.  Good story line.  Some parts a little goof.  Overall, very worthwhile.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|Very different from my usual subject matter .  Historical tale told from the viewpoint of a  young German girl.  Provides a different perspective of world war 2.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|It is good but there is not tons of levels like the first two. There are two on noms though which makes the game more fun.
B00CWM3F4C|3.0|It's Alice in chains but its all of the drudgery and none if the rock. If you can't sleep throw this on for a just going through the motions of being alive in chains snooze fest. Layered vocals check signature elements of a grungy aic album check anything exciting or special? Not here enjoy facelift and dirt and remember the good times
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I got it for my kids but I'm the one who plays it. It really helps me relax.  Thank you!
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Every one of Nicholas Sparks books I've read have been great.  I constantly find myself getting pulled in and this one was no different.  I had trouble putting it down and found myself looking forward toned time when I would read.  Countless hours that I should have spent sleeping were filled with this wonderful story.
B000L3CHC0|5.0|I bought this watch for my husband as a birthday gift, I was quite nervous because he's known to be very peculiar if not peaky about watches, it took quite some time to arrive but it didn't disappoint when it did. I showed it to him the soonest he got home and he was amazed by the elegance without pretentiousness that this watch has to offer, we went out for a dinner party on the weekend and instead of his TAG or the fancy schmancy Omega he decided to wear the Tissot I gave him, oh boy, many of his friends asked him what type of watch that was. He was so very happy and pleased, I could see it in his eyes. This is definitely an eye catcher piece of jewelry, you get a timeless watch for a very affordable price. A great gift for a husband/boyfriend/fiancé/father/brother. Very satisfied with my purchase!
B0016BP0PW|4.0|Let's face it, most musicals suck.  This is not one of them.  An interesting spin on old Beatles music, and the 1960's.
B0034G4P26|2.0|I bought this for my nephew because he loves pirates and I was expecting a much better movie.  It was boring and definitely did NOT keep his attention.
0307887448|5.0|Loved this book from page 1.  Will definitely catch the movie in theaters, and will follow Ernest Cline through his writing career.
B009NY43NY|3.0|Obviously you must read this book if you have read the rest but I have to admit that I was very disappointed in the story and how it ended.  It was almost boring. The only thing that kept me going were the characters that I have come to love and the wanting of something more exciting to happen.
B0049J0CTM|5.0|I was dubious of seeing this movie when it came out because Disney movies had grown to have politically correct and sterile or formulaic plots, particularly in the late 1990s. This movie, however, was surprising fresh. It had a lot of appropriate but timeless humor. The plot is watchable for adults who are forced to watch it over and over due to kids. This one never gets old.<br /><br />I am also a purist for animation. I usually do not care for Computer generated animation, but this one is well done. It does not look as fake or wonky as a lot of the computer generated films of yore.
B001Q7JD5O|5.0|the movie was great, the action and the way it was put togther was awsome, I can whatch the movie over and over just to see what I have missed.
B00BMVTS1S|4.0|This is a pretty well done adaptation of the first half of the beloved Tolkien novel. It is pretty classic Peter Jackson fare in terms of story telling and cinematography: sweeping and epic, particularly in the battle and &#34;running through the middle of a mountain&#34; scenes, and starts out and ends well, but tends to get bogged down in the middle. He also does not stay true to the plot in some places, bringing in odd things not found in the book, some of which did not seem particularly relevant to the plot. My major gripe was the length: at over 2 hours, it ends without even being 100 pages into the original novel. Overall, a very good addition to his LOTR trilogy as a flick but not perfect.
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|Kids and adults can have fun with this. It gets more and more challenging the more you play it. Lots of fun twists.  Easy to download.
B001ILFUDC|4.0|Having young ones in the house, requires being prepared. Would rather have them watch a classic than the junk that comes out now
B003G4W49C|5.0|Enders' Game is short and satisfying, genuine and thought provoking. You will fall in love with the characters, the plot twists, and the sheer entertainment that Ender's Game provides! READ IT.
B000F8O35U|4.0|Who doesn't want to see good defeat evil and have a young girl learn her lesson about listening to her father.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|great set dressing, acting and script...totally believable.  I'm halfway through the third series and this shouldn't really required words.  There
B0094K1WZE|3.0|It's not that Tom Cruise is long in the tooth, it's not that you really really really have to suspend disbelief (and not all for the special effects), it's not that Ethan Hunt might very well be kin to Spider Man but this is about spies, not do-gooders. For me, it's that it never really gripped me the way earlier MIs have. I suppose if you are into the mindless stuff - special effects, technology, groovy cars and car chases, then you might like this, although there are probably dozens of other movies with these elements that don't require you to follow along as much. For me the story is not all that compelling. The characters are mostly one-dimensional and I don't really care who's the good guy and who's the bad guy. Or girl.<br /><br />It's fairly entertaining but I'd have rather not had to pay to see it.
B002R25THI|3.0|I certainly appreciated the tension levels in the film as it cranks it up pretty slowly over the course if the picture. Also wonderful are a young Richard Crenna, one of the greatest character actors of all time Jack Weston and of course Alan Arkin who plays his menacing baddie as a Beat Generation Charlie Manson. What I could not get past, however, was the overshadowing melodrama of the film in the performance of Audrey Hepburn. It seems impossible now that she was nominated for an Academy Award for what I found to be a ridiculously shrieky performance. Not only was it unbuyable that she was blind but her breathy \\"woe is me\\" intonations border on whiny. Perhaps the film is just a product of its day but I couldn't help but feela different actress would have sold the role, and by extension the film, much better.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I love hidden object games, and this one was very engaging. I especially love when the games have a storyline as well. I couldn't wait to see how the story ended
B000I9U75G|5.0|Love this movie, have grandson who loves dino's, excellent movie for him. Matthew Brodrick, is the best actor, beside's godzilla...
B0089LOG02|5.0|I loved this story. It blended the stories of two women, one in the present and one in the past. It drew some wonderful parallels between the two and just wove a colorful tale of the complexities of growing up as an orphan in any era. With a good dose of history thrown into the mix, it was never a dull ride on the Orphan Train! Excellent characters and writing...who could ask for more?
B007UZO3F6|4.0|I have some minor weird issues with the USB front ports, but nothing that I need.  (dual port cables in the usb2 slots cause the machine to crash)  Overall, I really like the form factor and have not been able to find any other case that approaches it.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Definitely worth the read! Suspenseful with a surprising twist at the end.  As much as I didn't like the ending It was the perfect ending!! Couldn't put it down!
B005UG542S|5.0|The final movie was worth the wait. I wish they had more time put more of the books in the movies.
B00632HWOG|5.0|Its a great app I would suggest it to everyone I know. I get my mail faster using the app.
B00BQPEIT2|2.0|The game is okay but you have to pay to do anything. Didn't know that. The graphics are great, putting $$ into it, not fun..
B00CWV8TIU|4.0|Solid cast and everyone does their part well. Movie is not as predictable as a lot of others out there
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book was a great sequel. I could not put this book down. It was a great escape from reality for a few days. I've already bought the set for my Mom knowing that she would enjoy the story and the ease of reading this trilogy.  Easy story, entertaining story, and it doesn't hurt that parts of the book make your girly parts tickle.<br />:-)
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|It is the best game in the word it is so fun I can stop playing it<br />You should get it
B0009HLD0K|5.0|It's a fantastic movie, it makes you feel good and you can relate to the characters. Everyone should watch it.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|good old times playing upgrading your car or just killing off your guy trying to do flops and live just all around fun just trying to fill up the minimum word requirement Lol but you must try
B0012GTZC0|4.0|Not as polished as his later works, but still a good read. I enjoy the mix of history and fiction
B004J4WKTW|3.0|Very entertaining story, but lacking substance.<br />I think the author missed the opportunity to make a lasting effect on the reader.
B004JMZPJG|4.0|My Nikon D5100 fits in the bag, but the fit is not snug. I will be fitting a piece of foam inside the bag to snug things up a bit more. The camera rests on its lens as there is no sling built into the bag to support the weight of the camera. The pockets are perfect for carrying my charger, cables, and a few other small odds and ends. If you are looking for a bag that will hold extra lenses or a speedlight, keep looking because this is not the one for you.<br /><br />Even though the bag may not be perfect, it is a great bag for the price. I needed a bag to carry my camera and a few essentials when I take it out. So it's not perfect, but what in life ever is? It looks sharp, feels secure, protects my camera, and was a great price.
B00BCX2F66|5.0|I ordered this case on a Wednesday night and it was at my door by Saturday morning, it came two days earlier! I'm in love with this case. It does fill cheap holding it in my hands but it is absolutely beautiful with the HTC One inside it. The red and black colors of the case goes really well with the white, black, and silver colors on the HTC One. It doesn't add that much bulk to the phone like my old outter box case did and now I don't feel so paranoid when the phone is in my pockets because the flip is protecting the screen. Many people say that their HTC One phone does not fit well in this case but mines fits very well and it's not coming out. Overall I don't think that this case offers the most protection  like other cases such as my outter box case but it does make the phone stand out more and the flip stand is amazing.
B00ATK02WM|4.0|Overall the movie wasn't too bad, but not my favorite film version. The ending was the biggest letdown for me. Javert just calmly walks into the river instead of jumping off the bridge. But I thought that Malkovick did basically play a good Javert.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|This CD has great pieces that attract young people who will grow up to be a generation that loves symphony music.  You can listen over and over again and never get tired of the music.
B0049985XW|5.0|This is a great movie overall, but my favorite scene (of course) is the &#34;Badges&#34; scene, has to be one of the greatest lines in movie history!!
B00C33M2EE|5.0|Each piece was special and highlighted their talent.  I especially loved the DVD because their music also has a visual component.
B00ATP24NW|5.0|It's been a long time where several of the songs on an album gives me goosebumps and this one does. I had tears in my eyes from several of the songs. That means it's one of the best albums I've found of 2013. I can't wait for more albums from this band. Awesome!
B00AECGQF2|5.0|This is a great app! Very fun and easy, also it has not given me any trouble, although  I have never seen the character with the striped shirt in the pics.

B0028MBKVG|5.0|I picked up this book the week I decided to start training for a half marathon. It was neat to follow along with Chris as he experienced his running, as well. While the book is not instructional directly, I found the the tale to be just what I needed to continue my training. The Tarahumara indeed sound like majestic beings. The history of how we evolved to run was something I would have never imagined, as well. At first, it seemed like Chris delves into many side-stories that were initially distracting, but each story was so interesting and came connecting back in such a unique way. Thanks for sharing the story!
B002CGSYNU|3.0|This does not fit my EP3 14-42mm zuiko lense. It's slightly larger. The previous comment about how the lens cap works helped me. Basically you look for the filter size on your lens (mine is 37mm), and buy any lens cap that size.
1451673442|1.0|I read [[ASIN:1582701709 The Secret]] and thought the concept was interesting - if you put positive thoughts out to the universe about what you are looking for, you are likely to attract that into your own life.  Then I got this book - and was terribly disappointed.  It is so sophomoric, overly simplistic, sappy and repetitious.  It's like the author was just trying to fill up the pages, and kept saying the same thing over and over.  If it had been about 15 pages long, it might have been worth reading.<br /><br />Honestly, I felt way more grateful after reading a memoir, [[ASIN:098900869X Leaving the Life: A true story of love, loss and gratitude]]  It's the story of a couple who endured terrible tragedy, yet came out it with a sense of gratitude that was truly inspirational.  THAT story reminded me of all I have to be grateful for, and made me realize how important gratitude is, how to practice it.  The Magic failed to do it for me.
0307352153|5.0|I loved the way she explained introverts.  I think we all have some of each of the characteristics.  I have sent it to my daughter-in-law as a good read.  She has 8 children and each child of course is very different.  Introverts often take more time to get to know but if I stop and really give them time to talk and then listen there is much to learn.  They are truly wonderful friends.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is AWESOME!!!!!!!! I love it it was free , has a lot of characters ,has boards and is better than Temple Run 2 &Temple Run 1 Its Awesome
B0064MGU98|5.0|I am  huge fan of Scandal but this is a nice slower pace (close second)...great acting, plot and story line.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|If you are looking for an alarm app, this is the app to pick!! It's perfect!! It fits the needs to wake you up in the morning. It also has a sleep timer. I am so grateful I found this app! It's better than any other alarm app I've saw. I recommend this app to everyone.
B004GUSG4M|4.0|This is a fascinating story  with a well-written, unexpected twist.  A very enjoyable read!  I had a hard time putting it down!

030758836X|1.0|The book started off captivating!  About half way through I was starting to get annoyed.  There's just too many \\"coincidences\\"!  The end was probably the worse end to a book that I have ever read......mostly because there really wasn't an ending.  Don't waste your money!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is a great game but it becomes a better game when u have pocketinvpro  let's u have a mod like too many items
B0019HQIGS|5.0|Something resonated with the first Mayer song I heard in 2001 No Such Thing. I bought Any Given Thursday DVD when it came out so I have known about his musicianship from early on. I also like jazz so got Try! when it came out. Mayer took all of what he had learned and down not only from 2001 to 2007 but all those years training himself and put together one of the finest concert performances, well in recent history at least.<br /><br />Even though his personal choices don't seem to match the lyrics of his songs often, he does write touching, moving lyrics and is arguably one of the better songwriters of the last 15 years. I think he is on par with the best guitarists of the last 50 years. And you get him in all his incarnations her: acoustic, jazz trio, and band. I have been to two live shows and this band set up I like best. He had horns the first time I saw him and ditched them the second time. First time was better.<br /><br />You get some great drumming from Steve Jordan. 'Dayla' his long-time bassist is in the band set. I bought the DVD years ago and the Blu-Ray recently. Blu-ray is very well done. I'd go for that, it is a real treat although the DVD is a great price now. I doubt a single-concert goer that night said well that sucked or I didn't get my money' worth. And neither would anyone getting the Blu-ray. One note on the Blu-ray the Blu-Ray live extra is not supported any longer and on the package it said through 2010.
B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|I love this game. My friend has it then I got it. One flaw is that I was walking in farm on day time and I had 7/8 then when I was walking or running to the very beat up house I fell into Bolivian and just had to quit. Nice game but needs more stages Sprint button different looking slendy  Wants: Camera angle change button<br />A  expert difficulty and different modes like $20  mode
0143122843|4.0|I gave this very enjoyable book 4 stars instead of 5 because I expect a Philip Kerr book to be flawless.  Instead I found several proof reading mistakes and worst, we have German officers using the notably English adjective &#34;bloody&#34; in their conversations, i.e detective Kahlo on page 265 (paperback version) and General Heydrich on page 309.  Still for creating a richly hewn and intimate atmophere one can't beat Kerr.  The reader gets to feel that he or she is the proverbial &#34;fly on the wall&#34; while these dispicable characters weave their nasty plots and sinister webs of deceit and vengence.<br /><br />I also believe that the reader will enrich their reading experience with this novel by reading either before or after it, the entry in Wikipedia on Reinhard Heydrich.  Doing so will probablly also raise the question in the reader's mind as to whether the Kripo policeman Bernhard Wehner was the real life model for Bernie Gunther.
B000002OR4|5.0|The Schindler's List, is one of my topten movies. The main theme, interpreted with violin,  is awesone. It's a Steven Spielberg masterpiece
B005K17RU0|1.0|the old version was great,  I loved it.  strongly dislike the upgrade.  It is slow to load and not User friendly. Uninstalling.
B005S9ELVC|3.0|Set in 1949, Los Angeles, \\"Gangster Squad\\" follows the story of an off-the-book team of police detectives tasked with bringing down Mickey Cohen, a mobster who rules the city. Directed by Ruben Fleischer, best known for his joyful and unpredictable \\"Zombieland,\\" the crime action drama lacks originality in spite of the beautiful photography and great cast including Josh Brolin, Ryan Gosling, Nick Nolte, Robert Patrick, Michael Peña, Sean Penn, Giovanni Ribisi and Emma Stone.<br /><br />Though \\"Gangster Squad\\" features several real-life figures such as police sergeant John O'Mara (Josh Brolin) and a gangster Mickey Cohen (Sean Penn), the storyline and episodes are mostly fictional. Some may criticize the film for its clichéd story and typecast characters, but the fast-paced film is not boring thanks to the fine performances form the cast, impressive period details and gorgeous photography by Dion Beebe (\\"Chicago\\" \\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\").<br /><br />What the film needs is more intense conflict between O'Mara and Cohen. Interactions between the squad members are also weak. Generally speaking, if action sequences are not very thrilling, it is because audiences just don't care what is going to happen to these uninteresting characters.<br /><br />It is reported that the film was re-shot because of the 2012 Colorado shooting. But I think the re-shooting has nothing to do with the workmanlike direction and by-the-numbers storytelling. \\"Gangster Squad\\" is a reasonably entertaining crime action that could have been better with more fleshed-out characters.
B004IPPINW|3.0|Slow start but very good finish. Sadly, the slow start took about three quarters of the book.  The end left the reader hanging--and thinking (and that's very good).
B000ZLFALS|5.0|This movie is one of my wifes favorite movies. We love the Beetles, so this is a classic in our books. We own it on DVD and Blu-Ray now.
B0006SSOHC|5.0|This is the movie that got me into horror films. It's clever, its crazy, and its so twisted. The one that started it all, began the story of the jigsaw killer. Love this movie along with the other 6. It beats the hell out of halloween and Friday the 13th and other stupid joke horror films that's for sure. The scariest part of the movie and the saw movies are, as messed up as the traps are in it. Just think how beyond messed up the writers are for coming up with the traps and story lines. Lol. If you haven't seen it you should, buy it and you'll love it. The ending will floor you and then get the rest of the series :)
B008K6HN8I|3.0|Even with this application I have trouble finding things in the file structure on my phone.  But it is colorful and does help if you are looking around for files.
B002VWNIDG|5.0|I'll make it short and sweet. Great cast, Jack Nicholson is downright amazing in this movie. There's lots of creepy and twisted moments that just make you go wtf? Twin girls, elevator of blood, kid talking with his finger,ghost of a bartender, a very disturbing scene with a guy dressed up as a bear and murder. I've seen this movie countless times and it never gets old. I love it, I always will and if you get It I Know you will too :) redrum! also if you like the shining check out Slipknot music video spit it out as they do a spoof of it and the Simpsons episode of tree house of horror. Long live the shining! :)

B0026S93C0|4.0|A classic 80's hit. Kicked off a Jennifer Beale's career. Good music. Not for young girls who like dance. (Strip club scene)
B00A8MGLAI|2.0|I give this movie a two star rating because it sucked, telling multiple stories is fine, if its past present then future. This movie jumps from one scene to the next, mixing the past present and future into random scenes, has you jumping back and forth trying to figure out what its about, you do get sucked into one story then it jumps to different time, and back to another generation, personally if you liked the movie Momento you'll probably like this one. For me, it was too confusing to keep up with which story is which, i kept fast forwarding through different scenes, to see if it got any better, but just got more complex and tiring to watch. I like Tom Hanks, and Halley Berry they are good actor/actress, just not in the movie. 2 stars
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I have never rated a game before but this one was truly challenging and had beautiful graphics.  Worked perfectly on my Kindle Fire HD.  The only drawback was that it took a bit of time to load each new level or continue the game after I returned to it.  I thought it had frozen, but it just takes a while.  I look forward to more Rooms!
B003TSEEDY|2.0|Maybe it's just me, but I cannot get into this little book.  It has a clever premise and the content seems interesting, but I just cannot pick it back up.

B005S9ELVC|5.0|This movie is wonderful! I love the action, romance, and drama of it all. Ryan Gosling, of course, makes any movie enjoyable for me. My boyfriend enjoyed this movie as well so, if you are looking for an movie to share with your girl that's not a \\"chick flick\\", this just might be it.
125000098X|4.0|I gave this rating because I hated the ending.  The ending was horrible, and it upset me for several days.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I will admit, I did not want to see this movie. I am not a fan, I did not enjoy the trilogy, but this movie was pretty good. Its along a different story line than the Ring trilogy and the special effects/scenery in this movie are amazing. It kept my interest the entire movie and I quite enjoyed it. I have never read the books, but have heard from others that the movie  (as per usual) leaves out a lot. Overall, I would recommend this movie for just about anyone and it is a decent family movie which is so rare these days.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|My kids and I love this movie! The writing, acting, animation, music--everything about it is hilarious, touching, and amazingly well-done.
B005LAIIJY|4.0|If you are a fan of Tarantino you will likely love this movie. Lots of action, intrigue and comedy all rolled into one. It's a love story of a twisted sort, but not so romantic that you men won't enjoy it. My boyfriend and I both loved this movie, but we are fans to Tarantino. If you are not a fan or not sure if you like the slightly odd, you may want to hold off on this movie. It involves a lot of guns, murder, guts and gore so if you are squeamish pass is by.
B00AEBBA36|5.0|great movie. lots of good action and seans and it's true. if you like war movies you'll love this! buy it
B004KZOWEG|4.0|This book was incredibly well researched and full of fascinating facts without overwhelming you with details. The history it discusses is important to know and yet very little is ever taught in school. I consider this an easy read for its structure and I could not put the book down. Some of the atrocities depicted are a little hard to stomach but again important to learn about this part of history.
B00821OX98|5.0|One of the best TV made series. War of the world has been one of my favorite Si-Fi movies so this got me right off. I has just enough special effects great acting and great plot. I am watching for a second time and will watch season 2 getting ready foe season 3's start.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|This is a great show. There are a lot of different characters... so you really need to pay attention... but I guarantee it will completely suck you in. I watched the entire season while I was sick with the flu!
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|Like season one great sets, great acting and follows the books. Keep you on the edge of your seat on what will happen next . Always keeps us hanging waiting and wanting more.  I do not have HBO so it is a long wait for the next season to come to streaming but it is a show that's worth the wait.

B003K1EYM6|4.0|Both units are physically wider than the 30-pin power cable that was on my iPad.  This was a problem for me because they wouldn't fit into the dock connector with my [[ASIN:B007XOQ3BQ Griffin Survivor iPad case]].

B007L3BMGA|5.0|Blimey! This was intense.<br /><br />This is the story on Anastasia Steele and Christian Grey - I love the combination of their surnames. Steely grey is most definitely the colour of Christian's eyes.<br /><br />Ana and Christian meet and there is an intense connection between. Christian is a rich man, unaccustomed to not getting his way, and after initially warning Ana off him, pursues her in earnest. Turns out Christian has a dark, carnal side and is a dominant and wants Ana as his submissive. She's horrified at first but agrees to give the whole matter some thought. Their relationship deepens and is told from Ana's point of view for the entire novel - she's very 'real'. She suffers from all the same insecurities as the rest of us and is rather bashful.<br /><br />She is falling in love with him and I have no doubt that he is in love with her but Christian's past doesn't allow him to recognise his feelings and he just believes that he wants to possess Ana - we know better, right?<br /><br />Her eventual foray into submission is protracted, hard fought by Christian, over-thought by Ana and ultimately beautiful but Christian's needs are darker than Ana has bargained for - can she tolerate his demands or will it all be too much for her?<br /><br />We know quite a lot about Ana as she is the narrator but Christian's history is drip-fed and sparse. I want to know how he ended up being quite so wealthy, so young. Christian kind of reminded me of a frozen river - serene and calm on the outside but with deep running and battling undercurrents beneath the surface. He's definitely fifty shades of conflicted and a product of his past experiences that are slowly and rarely revealed to us.<br /><br />Ana is his polar opposite - all her emotions are on show and she is not a natural born submissive. She is cheeky and sasses Christian at almost every opportunity - she can't help herself and I found their banter and their emails very funny.<br /><br />I know this started out life as a Twilight fan-fic and you can see the parallels but the intense and turbulent emotional journey felt a little bit more like the movie Nine and a Half Weeks.<br /><br />I'm so glad that it says 'end of part one' at the end of the novel - the last few pages were emotionally draining and I have to confess that I sobbed all through them. I don't think I have cried at many books and the last one was Birdsong!<br /><br />Only one way to get over this - read the next one which is exactly what I am about to do.<br /><br />Thanks you Ms James - this is the best book I have read in a while. :-)as a Twilight fan-fic and you can see the parallels but the intense and turbulent emotional journey felt a little bit more like the movie Nine and a Half Weeks.<br /><br />I'm so glad that it says 'end of part one' at the end of the novel - the last few pages were emotionally draining and I have to confess that I sobbed all through them.

B008KW43TE|5.0|It is rare that an album comes along that is consistently interesting throughout. But this is one of them. Seriously worth buying.
B007KOYEOC|5.0|Noooo -I am so not ready to part from Christian and Ana.<br /><br />I was lucky to pick up book 1 to read coincidentally a week or so before book 3 was released and have been able to read these one after the other and it's been such a pleasure. Both Christian and Ana have been on an amazing personal and emotional journey throughout all 3 books and I feel like I've got to know them so well and am just not ready to move on. Where do I go from here and what on earth can I read next??<br /><br />This book pretty much just continues the story after we left them in Fifty Shades Darker - there's surprises in store ahead for both of them and it's fascinating to see the way they react and deal with them.<br /><br />I'm sure going to miss Ana's inner goddess, her inner subconscious, Christian's happy trail, SHOUTY CAPITALS and kinky youknowwhattery!! I'll miss their email exchanges - they made me grin.<br /><br />It's a wonderful journey with lots of crossroads, potholes and also hearts and flowers. It's an intense love story and I never once felt bored or like it was strung out and I actually wanted more.<br /><br />There's a very sweet epilogue which is not to be missed and, at the end of the book, a retelling of their first 2 meetings from Christian's POV.<br /><br />A most enthralling trilogy - one that will stay with me for ages.

0307474259|2.0|I did not like this as it is really not a good read for a very serious subject . Packed with too many things the ordinary person can not understand
0545091020|5.0|I picked up the audiobook of this from the Library as the waiting list for the hardback was too long.  I started listening to it on a 3 hour drive, and when I found myself at my location I could not bring myself to get out of the car because I did not want to stop listening!  This book is absolutely amazing.  I found myself loving every single character in the book, and my heart breaking for all of them at the same time.  It's a glimpse into a completely different world where feelings are the same even if the world we live in is not.  And it's a scary thought that the world of Panem may not be that far from where we are today.  A must read for teens and adults alike.
B0018OASZE|2.0|I decided to add Adele's 19 to my collection after buying her 21 album (both in vinyl format) and I was greatly disappointed with the poor sound quality.  There is so much compression that it is a shame that they would release such a poor quality vinyl format.  For audiophiles who are considering buying this album, my advice is to stay away from this.

B005PMNBNG|5.0|I love this album. I waited awhile to buy it, as I was skeptical that a 2-sided album would be filled with quality songs. But I love practically every song. My favorite one is the Outro. I usually dislike Outro-type songs, but this one is excellent. I have had the album on repeat for a week, and I enjoy it more every time I listen to it. Thanks M83 for releasing a great album!
B00CWVG1Z8|4.0|The story line develops its antagonists and protagonists in a very flowing manner. The special effects, of course, add to the grandeur of the movie, while the story still carries it. Jeremy Irons and Emma Thompson acted as the epitome of what the movie dubs a &#34;castor.&#34; The juvenile story line that the &#34;Twilight&#34; sagas produced caught the attention, but &#34;Beautiful Creatures&#34; captures the essence.
B008M7BQHE|5.0|I loved this show from the first time I seen it. I wish there were more good tv shows for me to watch. Me and my boyfriend watch it together.
B002EDH0FE|4.0|Being as closely filmed to the actual graphic novel, i thoroughly enjoyed it. The special effects, cinematography, actors, and direction were all pivotal in making one of the ultimate classic graphic novels of all time come to life on the screen.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game was very fun. I recommend you get a lot of coins and spend them later after you upgrade all your car parts.
B00559B9N8|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite reads--I can and have read it over and over again. DWJ pokes a bit of fun at the fantasy genre while making amusingly flawed but real characters. The dialogue never fails to make me giggle, and the narrative paints such a vibrant picture. I absolutely adore this book.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love minecraft!!! It's so fun, you can build whatever you want and do whatever you want. In survival mode you basically try to stay alive and in creative mode you can build whatever your imagination desires! THIS APP IS A MUST GET! Ps. This app is addictive! ;)
B00280LYHS|5.0|I love Rick Riordan and this the perfect ending to the Percy Jackson series. The book is captivating and draws you in for the first page. It is entertaining and and well written. I recommend this book and the rest of the series to any one who loves reading.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Sometimes you just need a break from reading and day to day activities. The trouble with this one is you get hooked and can't put it down!  It is a reverse Rubics cube with several playing options so you can play as long as you can or choose one of the timed mode. You rotate the cube and try to remove the matching colored cubes as fast as you can. Sounds easy maybe but after awhile you can't focus to keep the amount of stars on the cubes separate. My daughter got hooked and now I have to find a way to send it to her Kindle so she can continue to enjoy and leave mine alone.
B004I744AS|5.0|i will recommend this to everyone, especially students and readers of the kindle. will love to see many more apps in the future.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|My daughter told me about this book but warned me to wait until all three books were available as you don't want to stop reading at the end.  I followed her advice and was glad plus the fact that the trilogy was cheaper.
B00AESN8XY|4.0|I like this game because it involves more strategy than some of the other more addictive games that are mindless. But because you have to use your brain, I don't play it as often. I love that you can fast-forward the game so it moves faster if you're looking for a quick game.
B0035LGXXO|5.0|cant count how many tmes I have watched this movie, but first time was in 1981 by the 90s I lost count :)
0345451325|5.0|Great book, big fan of Science Fiction, an easy read. Im a big fan of the video game and books.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|It was to fast.  But it was fun. Kept my attention away from some day to day  activities.  And gave me something to do with OKLAHOMA tornados dropping all around us.  LET'S RIDE!!!!!! And pray for Oklahoma.
B00CL6HGIK|4.0|it was very entertaining. enjoy the movie. Love the actors the intruge of the movie. always like the price to watch a decent movies.
B00BHO7M5O|4.0|I think this story was a little slow and not true to the first movies and it seams rushed and very short .for what I see it going for at 79.99 please wait for the price to come down , I truly love the moves but this one was just a taste of what should come .
B007ZXK08C|4.0|Generally well constructed to keep you guessing, firstly about what happened then about what's going to happen. I liked the fact that the police weren't depicted as either stupid or super human powers of detection. There were a couple of inconsistencies early on that I suppose we could put down to the main character having a vivid imagination if it wasn't for the fact they were key to where the author wanted to take us. That makes them the equivalent of a co-incidence a poor writer uses to get out of a plot hole - either that or the character has psychic powers!
B00004RF9G|5.0|No one can dance like Gene Kelly.  He is superb in this movie.  He and Cyd  are great coupled together in this.  I really enjoyed it to the max and would recommend it to anyone that loves musicals.
B00A81MV3U|5.0|I loved this movie and had to buy it right away, I love the dance parts and the whole thing!!!
B004SJ3AXI|1.0|I've never played Angry Birds before but decided to try the free app on my new smartphone. I could not figure the darn thing out! It was way more frustrating than fun,

B00APUYWYA|4.0|This movie was hilarious! I watched it with my pre-teen and we giggled and laughed so much! Although I will say I could have done with out the language!
B002NXSRVG|5.0|This was a good movie, I did not think I was going to enjoy this type of movie as much as I did
B0002VFXFE|5.0|Don't buy anything else. Unless its the Arctic Silver 7. I use this and only this product. It is much better than some of the others I have tried, it cures without drying and doesn't have that gritty feel that some of the others do. The grittiness of the others make me think there will not be smooth even contact between the heatsink and CPU. With Arctic Silver, I don't have that problem.
B000J3OTSM|5.0|GREAT DANCE MOVIE AND LOVE CHANNING TATUM AND ALL HIS MOVES, THIS IS ALSO JUST A GREAT MOVIE OVERALL WITH THE WHOLW STORY LINE BEHIND THE WHOLE FLICK
B00C2VIA52|5.0|Addictive and fun gameplay. Only downside cards are expensive. Very very very very time consuming also. Other than that a very nice app to waste time on.
B003Y5H5B0|5.0|I LOVED IT GREAT FUNNY MOVIE LAUGHED THROUGH THE WHOLE THING CHANNING AT HIS COMEDY BEST AND MAKING US ALL LAUGH THIS IS A GREAT FUN MOVIE
