B00005KHEU|5.0|It's been 31 years now since ELO's \\"Discovery\\"#5, in 1979, came out.  Now i'm a big ELO and Jeff Lynne supporter, i've supported him on most of his projects he has done since ELO broke up in 1986.  Now back to this album \\"Discovery\\", I still listen to it maybe twice a year or so.  It might not be ELO's brightest hour, but it sure sounds good with most of this stuff they call music today.  \\"Shine A Little Love\\"#8 in the spring of '79, was a great 1st single from the album, it still sounds good today.  \\"Don't Bring Me Down\\"#4 the summer hit, I got burnt out on this song after radio played it in the ground. (the hazards of radio!).  But I like it again because I don't here it every 2 hours, maybe 5 times a year now.  \\"Confusion\\" #37  in the late summer, Richard Tandy plays a Yamaha CS-80 keyboard a new instrument at the time.  Their last hit was a fall release, the disco infused \\"Last Train To London\\" #39.  Other songs that make this album a great listen are, \\"The Diary Of Horace Wimp\\", a big hit in the U.K., America should of tried it also, it's got that great Beatle influenced sound.  \\"Need Her Love\\", a good love song, Jeff was about to be married at the time.  \\"Midnight Blue\\", a song I really enjoy, very good guitar by Jeff, I really think this should of been a single back then.  \\"On The Run\\", is a good upbeat number, a true Jeff Lynne tune in the 70's.  They did a stand-up version of the late Del Shannon's \\"Little Town Flirt\\".  I'm not a person that holds bands accountable for changing their sounds from album to album.  I love that bands change there direction once an awhile, it makes things fresh.  ELO's \\"Discovery\\", is still fresh 31 years later.  After they did \\"Xanadu\\", they switched up on everybody and went Space-rock-synthpop with \\"TIME\\".  That's what I love about ELO  and Jeff Lynne.
0316098337|5.0|Room by Emma Donoghue<br /><br />This novel is told throught the voice of Jack, a five year old boy. The grammar and cadence are all in a five year old or younger tone. It was slightly odd, but it didn't take me long to get into reading in that view.<br />There is Jack and Ma together in a Room. From Jack's perspective, we see how he learns, observes and interacts with his mom in this one setting.<br />(Possible spoilers)<br />Jack was born and raised (till the age of five) in captivity. His mother,referred to as \\"Ma\\" was kidnapped at the age of 19 and held captive in a<br />detached shed measuring eleven by eleven.<br />The story continues and we see Jack grow and understand how to interact and how he perceives other situations and people. Jack is so real because we read his thoughts and how he understands or thinks. The book really has amazing insight into how and what this 5 year old feels in his life.<br />I really liked how the author gave us a view inside the \\"Room\\" and plenty of time to see how the characters adjusted outside the \\"Room.\\"<br />The descriptions here of emotions of both Jack and Ma are so memorable, touching, and real that this is a can't-put-down book and one that I won't soon forget.<br />Also, check out room the book dot com forward slash inside<br />[...]

B00070QXL8|4.0|If you enjoyed the original Bridget Jones and the occassional raining men, then The Edge of Reason is a must for your movie collection or just for viewing.  The sequel picks up where Bridget Jones (Renee Zellweger) and Mark Darcy (Colin Firth) left off, the start of a new diary, new year, and new relationship.  Of course, Bridget being paranoid and self conscious, doubts herself and her new life and, well, you need to watch the movie to find out what happens next.  Oh, don't forget, Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant) still pops up from time to time to help poor Bridget along in a mess that could or couldn't be a relationship.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I have done this DVD workout 5 times now. I really enjoy the fast pace and Jillian is good at pushing without being annoyingly perky. I am still on level 1 and I think I will do that for a few more days and then see how hard level 2 is. The only bad thing (as others have mentioned) is the beginning cannot be skipped. You have to listen to Jillian's 2 minute intro each time. Other than that, great workout for people who want fast results!
0374158460|2.0|A disappointment.      Does Franzen have children?  I suspect he doesn't, and that's why the descriptions of the Bergland family dynamics, while having the ring of truth, are just missing something.  We never really get a glimpse inside the house.  Their lives are told at a distance from the point of view of friends and neighbors.  Within the average American household, marital relations, at least those that go the distance described here (birth through college), are much messier and yet a whole lot more loving in ways that are just not shown in this book.      There's also this made-for-t.v. aspect to the novel, one in which the cost of living - actual dollars and cents -- is completely missing from life's equations. (It's like those t.v. sit-coms in which presumably working class households have perfectly matching furniture and everything is spic-and-span. Who paid for that divan?) I don't know a married couple together today who doesn't think about the financial implications of a break-up as much as the emotional ramifications.    And while Patty Bergland is recognizable, I think I speak for most women here:  working for wages (i.e., outside the home) is not an option;  it's a necessity.  Stay-at-home motherhood of the variety that also includes cupcake-baking, kids' sports activities, and Victorian house renovations is only possible for people with some serious (probably inherited) money.  A spouse's environmental activist/lawyer's salary would be a reach.      Finally, the Richard Katz character...well, those of us who came of age in the late 70s and early 80s can certainly relate to his sense of alienation and his reluctance to commit.  But does he have to rag on the youth of today to make his point?  Sounds like an old codger to me, one not too different from every other embittered emissary from an earlier generation who couldn't handle life's realities.  Does he not form any lasting relationships in the music world itself?  What happened to his Grammy-awardnominated band members?    The main characters' childish solipsism carried through to middle age makes them unlikeable, if not unrealistic. I think I understand what Franzen is trying to do, but it's not quite the America I know or see around me.  Those kids attending that concert that Katz goes to with Walter?  More likely than not, they're more mixed ethnically and racially than ever before.  Not too many pure whitebread households around anymore.  And that's not necessarily a bad thing.

B001PJRAUS|5.0|Being an admirer of Jane Austen novels, I was fully prepared NOT to like this movie, but I was thoroughly fascinated by it.  Amanda Price, a present day young woman, fantasizes about the gentler time described in the novel, which she she has read many times, and gets her chance to go into the world of Regency England.  She switches places with Elizabeth Bennett and events start going wrong immediately for Ms Price.    In essence, the movie turns the story on its ear.  Characters from the novel are not acting as Ms Price knows they should, and she tries to set things aright--with very limited success.  We learn that Austen had somewhat misjudged some of the characters, Wickam in particular.  All that adds to the enjoyment.    Meanwhile, we keep wondering how Elizabeth is doing in 21st century London.  What we eventually learn of that comes as an enormous surprise.  In fact, there are many surprises in this lush production.  It was three hours long, and I hoped for another three hours of it.
0143118420|4.0|I bought the book for my grandma because she wanted to see the movie.  She was in a good mood and talkative, I believe because the of the book.
0143118420|5.0|Eat, Pray, Love is a book that made me smile. Ms Gilbert's voice is original and honest with a teasing undertone. She is an extremely talented writer who bravely put her experience out there for others to learn from, commiserate with, or live vicariously through. Those who criticized her writing skills clearly reveal their own lack in that regard. I am surprised to see the number of people (514) that wrote scathing reviews--actually revealing their own limited world view and lack of empathy for this woman's suffering. Yes, other people on the planet have more significant or grave life experiences to be focused on--and there are a million books written covering those subjects. Mostly when people are so riled up over an issue, they are projecting their own shortcomings. Elizabeth Gilbert wrote a painfully honest report of her coming of age in this time of \\"having it all\\" being the hue and cry of our culture. To criticize a memoir for being self-absorbed is laughable, that is the nature of the genre. To be almost rabidly critical of another's life experience is sad. If you hated the book so much you could have saved us all a lot of negative energy bombardment by keeping your nastiness to yourself and not writing anything at all. You know, like what your mother probably taught you but didn't sink in--if you don't have something nice (or intelligent [my word]) to say, don't say anything at all.
038572179X|5.0|That the book was better than the film should come as no surprise; the book usually is better anyway. I had never read any of McEwan's novels. I saw \\"Atonement\\" (the film) first, and loved it. It wasn't until later that I realized it had been adapted for film.    The movie is still a favorite, but now the book has a treasured place on my shelf as well. With this novel about the complexities of emotion, family, and the nuances of human relationships, McEwan definitely delivers a story worth re-reading.
B002ZG99G8|5.0|I love this movie! I went to see The Losers and Ironman 2 in the night with a friend and we both agreed that The Losers was the better movie. The best thing about it is that it doesn't try to be anything more than what it is- an action movie based on a comic book. There are explosions, capers, wisecracks and everything else that you would expect. The characters aren't fully drawn out, but they are more 3D than the characters in the movie A-Team, which came out at the same time. And it's an action movie not an indie drama, so I didn't expect more than it delivered. The soundtrack is great (too bad the one they're selling on CD is lame) and it had the feel of the comics it's based on. I'm looking forward to seeing more from Oscar Jaenada and Chris Evans in the future. And I really hope they do make a sequel.

B002ZG98UK|4.0|Just saw the movie in 3D at Reagal Cinemas tonight...  This was my 3rd 3D movie & I must say this one looked the best! Go see it in 3D...    Like the previous movies in the series, this movie mostly kept with the main story...  Alice going after Umbrella Corp. Killing some zombies, sporting amazing moves and weaponery...  There was some zombie killing, but it also had more to offer...  Alice's search for the umbrella corps leader was pretty intense and like always there were a few intense fights...    The weaponery was superb... those shotguns(similiar to modernwarfare2 shotguns) were awesome...  Alice had some amazing moves, as well as Claire...    The special effects were very well done... never did the scenes look over the top like in lets say, Die Hard 4 or a movie of that nature...    All in all the movie was well done, and I liked it better than 3 for sure...    Im excited, because it looks like there will be another one coming...    I give the movie 4 stars and thought it was Great, but could have had a little more fight sequences & action in some parts...  Thanks for reading my review...

9889979942|5.0|Tom Carter has done an absolutely astounding job of producing an extremely comprehensive collection of photographs that illustrate the multifaceted depth of modern China.    I've had [[ASIN:9889979942 CHINA: Portrait of a People]] on my shelf for a while now and routinely return to it anytime I visit or plan to visit a new area of this massive country. Each of the hundreds of images in this weighty brick of a book tell a different and complex story.    Tom modestly explains in the introduction to the book that his camera was only a tool, a \\"means to an end\\", and that the \\"snapshots\\" in the collection are not meant to be pieces of \\"art\\". It is my opinion that good art is beautiful while also drawing the viewer in and leaving them asking questions, both internally and externally, about the subject -- Tom's photographs nail that perfectly.
B002ZG99CC|3.0|In the United States, it was released as THE KARATE KID based on the popular 1984 film and film series starting in 1984 of the same name. It was releasd under the title THE BEST KID in Japan and South Korea. Appropriately, it was releasd as THE KUNG FU KID in China. The title baffled some people when the movie's film production, and story remake was set in ...China? (with Chinese/Hong Kong action star Jackie Chan in the mentoring role{?} originated by Japanese-American actor Pat Morita). At least producer, Will Smith, whose son, Jaden is in the title role, didn't play the mentor. Karate is a Japanese art form and Kung Fu is a Chinese art form. Well, it didn't baffle moviegoers too much because it made enough bucks and critical praise to garner a planned sequel. The filmmakers should have just titled it THE MARTIAL ARTS KID, or even better..THE ULTIMATE FIGHTING KID.

B001GZ6QEC|5.0|I got this for my son, who at 11 is unfortunately too young for it (I discovered).  Undaunted, I watched it myself and was simply floored at how good it was.  Batman is personally flawed, and many in the public believe he is a dangerous vigilante.  He has a number of secret allies, but one of them submits to bitterness and becomes truly evil.  On the other side is the Joker, who is amazingly portrayed by Heath Ledger - a force for chaos, extremely clever, and realistically dangerous as he creates dilemmas for normal people to prove they are capable of evil.  As I watched it, I actually suspended my disbelief and completely enjoyed the world that the film creates.  This is very very rare for me these days, mostly I watch things for the sake of my kids.  But this is a film that adults can enjoy on a different level, with fine acting and even themes to which they might relate.  It is comic-book film transition as its best.<br /><br />Warmly recommended.<br /><br />Note:  I got the blu-ray version, and while it is definitely superior to normal dvds, I would not say it is a quantum leap improvement by any means.  Yes, blu-ray is very nice, but I have decided with this film that I am not prepared to pay a big premium except in very rare instances.
B00007GZR5|5.0|Lately I've been on a Robin Williams kick, having enjoyed Bicentennial Man recently.  I picked up this DVD and though the film tends to be maudlin at times, overall is quite a production!<br /><br />Philosophy:<br /><br />In my studies I had discovered that thought is greater than reality, and that you are not your arms, legs or brain, but you are you as a spiritual being.  The film emphasized this without beating you over the head with its spiritual thought & inspiration, but was necessary to develop this concept for the film to make sense!<br /><br />Annie & Chris:<br /><br />Annie & Chris meet with the typical Hollywood \\"cute moment.\\"  They ram their boats into each other in Europe.  Annie has claimed Switzerland in the name of Minnesota and Chris just claims her for his bride.  We don't get a lot of character development here until well into the film.  The flashback sequences are done well and are at times extremely emotional.  Their life looks great until their children get killed in a car crash.  Annie blames herself and goes into a deep depression which she never recovers.<br /><br />Mythology:<br /><br />There are ancient tales of the hero travelling into the depths of hell to recover his love.  Even the gates of hell in the film had a large ship with the name Cerberus (the three headed dog, natch!) on front!  The imagery of heaven and hell are well-presented.  The crazy Raphaelian paintings; the upside-down cathedral; the heaven created that is actually made of paint! Crazy!<br /><br />Ending:<br /><br />The movie slam-punches grief until you can just cry with the anguish that  Annie feels.  The film tastefully covers the areas of suicide and never giving up.  And even when you lose, you win (still trying to wrap my wits  on this one).  Movie critics have said that Robin Williams and Annabella Sciorra were not in tune in this film, but I beg to disagree.  At times maudlin and heart-wrenching, the actors do indeed put their heart into their work and come  out shining.<br /><br />DVD:<br /><br />Has an alternate ending which I'm glad was not in the final cut.  The actual ending was more a message of hope that did not drag the story way out.  The \\"making of\\" segment with a few words from the novelist Richard Matheson was also enjoyable.<br /><br />Recommended!<br /><br />Other Robin Williams Films:<br /><br />[[ASIN:630587493X Bicentennial Man]]<br />[[ASIN:B0014BQQZM Mrs. Doubtfire [Blu-ray]]]was not in the final cut.

I got excited about, grew impatient that I had to pre-order, misplaced it once it finally came in, and then leapt with joy when my husband found the book and I could FINALLY begin reading it.<br /><br />As someone who already considers herself a non-conformist, I was disappointed to find that there was nothing here for me.<br /><br />I was looking for something new and original, something to blast me into the next level of creativity.  This wasn't it. I guess I was looking for more \\"in-your-face-ness.\\"  I found it to be bland, timid, almost too polite in its approach--to the point of not even being motivational.<br /><br />The entire book can be summed up in three sentences:<br /><br />Don't follow the crowd.<br />You will need some goals--not all of them focused on you.<br />It will be scary at first, but YOU CAN DO IT!<br /><br />Blah.

B003EYVXYG|3.0|A band of rogue militants that are attempting to escape a world overrun by the undead find themselves caught in the middle of a feud between two families when they land on a remote island in the latest entry of George Romero's epic zombie series. Here, Romero quarrels with the idea of whether or not the living dead can be domesticated and eventually cured, or whether they must be eradicated to avoid any future outbreaks. This debate fuels the ongoing struggle between the O'Flynns and the Muldoons, a battle which takes center stage over any of the zombie mayhem in the film. While it cannot be argued that Romero has not attempted any new and interesting ideas in LAND, DIARY, and now SURVIVAL, the execution of each of the films always falls short. The sixth installment never manages to generate any forward momentum, and the social commentary that is worked in to the plot is never fully developed or used to effectively impact the viewer. To put it bluntly, the film is completely uninteresting. There is no one left for the audience to relate to or sympathize with between the thieving soldiers and the two warring families. The man once known for discovering Horror's greatest make-up artist has settled for cheaply-made computerized effects once again, effects which are entirely unconvincing and immediately take the viewer out of the action. Still, what the gore lacks in quality, it makes up for in quantity, with numerous attack sequences filled with head explosions and multiple maulings by the rampaging ghouls. As hard as Romero fans may try to dispute it, SURVIVAL OF THE DEAD continues the downward trend of declining interest and bland filmmaking that has plagued the director's most recent efforts.<br /><br />-Carl Manes<br />I Like Horror Movies
1582701709|3.0|This is an ok book but it oversimplifies things. You can get what you want but you have to be willing to put in the effort to get it. I read this book because everyone was talking about it and I wanted to see what was up. I found a book that tells you what you already know and tries to make it seem like some magical cosmic genie is there to grant your every wish. There is no Secret to success just hard work and perseverance. This book is an ok read if you want to be motivated but you have to remember that the people in the book WORKED HARD to get where they are and weren't handed things on a silver platter.

B001N1DPDE|4.0|The Becker Companion Model BK2 arrives very sharp out of the box. The BK2 features a 5-inch blade, decent kydex sheath, high impact plastic handles, a lanyard hole, a pummel end, and is full tang. It is a worthy survival knife, which ships with the valuable kydex sheath. It could be improved with the micarta handles, which are impervious to the elements in all climates. I bought this knife although I have the Ranger Afghan made by Ontario Knives. The OKC Ranger Series Afghan is comparible in size, thickness and quality, as both blades fit into the same kydex sheath. Both are full tang. However, the Ranger series Afhan has various models that posses the lanyard hole and pummel. Be sure to do your homework for its intended purpose prior to ordering. Further, the Ranger Afghan does not ship with a kydex sheath although it does have micarta grips. I suspect the makers held back to save costs. All-in-all both fixed blade knifes were built for abuse and will probably outlast the user. I plan to use both blades when my son accompanies me on the trail, and for camping, fishing, and general purpose use. If you can only afford one blade, go with the Becker Companion BK2, and forego upgrades.

B0017SWPXY|5.0|Having recently lost our seven year old pup to a horrible, but quick fight with cancer, I swore that I wouldn't ever own, touch, or read about another dog.  The heartbreak was just too great.    Four months after his passing, just before Christmas, I was wandering around a bookstore (one of my favorite places) and the furry face on this cover caught my eye.  A dear friend owns two Goldens, and I just had to get it for her.  When I curiously flipped it open and read the first few pages, I was enamored with the story told from Enzo, the dog's perspective.  I picked up and purchased another copy for myself, too.  I devoured my copy and intensely experienced the tribulations that face Enzo and his family.      This story is a must for any dog lover, or anyone who has ever loved a dog, be it their own or someone else's.  It presents life from the family dog's perspective, ever-observant and loyal, yet quiet and uninterrupting.  It is a most-wonderful read, and the last few pages of the book were the most precious gift to read and enjoy.      Undoubtedly, this book, and Enzo's beliefs helped in my grieving experience, and I am ever grateful to the little furface.    I can't wait for the day when our little boy touches our lives again!
B000002LFZ|3.0|Released in 1988,  this single disc collection of Fleetwood Mac's 1975-1987 biggest hits is good, but the 2002 2-disc \\"Very Best of Fleetwood Mac\\" is a much better choice. In addition to the 16-songs here are some lesser hits and great album tracks including \\"Landslide\\" and \\"Silver Springs.\\" That leaves no reason to choose this disc.
B001EN71CW|5.0|An awesome show. Too bad I did not find out about it until it was already canceled. A friend recommended it to me and lend me his DVD set. I loved it. The humor, the unique & colorful characters, and awesome casts and acting. It is truly ashamed that some dumb network executives can't see a great show even when it is right in front of their faces.

B003K3OF78|5.0|After reading some of the reviews I've seen on here, I thought it best to chime in on a few important notes for any buyer. First off, this is not an album, it's an EP. Therefore, eight tracks is actually pretty LONG for an EP. Second of all, the fact that is an EP and not an LP is what makes Night Train the masterpiece what it is, and experimental sidestep for the band that honestly, proves they can make just about any type of music they want. It's modern, it's pop, it's rock, it's a beautiful collection of songs that may not have been strong enough to land on the next LP but certainly were good enough to be released on an EP, and catchy enough to have you singing along in no time. Bravo Keane!    Best tracks:    Back in Time: The way Keane makes up for the intro track. A solid rock song done the best way Keane does rock, with blaring synth and beautiful vocals. Any fan of Under the Iron sea will love this track.     Stop for a Minute: The first of two collaborations with K'NAAN and the EP lead single. Honestly, a catchy chorus, truly meaningful lyrics, and a little rap. This is Keane in a way we have never seen then before... modern. And just like Perfect Symetry, this experimentation paid off.     Clear Skies: A beautiful song about America of all things. You would think that would suck... but just like the actual song \\"Perfect SYmmetry\\" had a political message and still came out beautiful, so does this. Trust me, it will be in your head all day.     My shadow: Just download it! It's Keane from Hopes and Fears, beautiful, elegant, ballads. Enjoy
0439023491|4.0|I was shocked at how much I loved Catching Fire. All my issues with The Hunger Games seemed to fade away in this second installment of Katniss and Peeta's story. Catching Fire made me understand the hype these books get, as it was really good, and make me realize how happy I was that awesome people like Gail and Heidi convinced me to read these.<br /><br />Katniss really rounded out as a character in Catching Fire, and I actually liked her, as opposed to how she drove me insane in The Hunger Games. Peeta continues to be a favorite character of mine. I just love him!<br /><br />I also found the writing much better in Catching Fire. Hunger Games had held me back, but I found myself zipping through this book in just a few hours, totally addicted.<br /><br />I'm still not 100% sold on these books, but I did enjoy Catching Fire a heck of a lot! I am joining the masses dying to read Mockingjay - which I will promptly be preordering. What an ending!
0671042858|2.0|\\"The world had teeth and it could bite you with them anytime it wanted. Trisha McFarland discovered this when she was nine years old. At ten o' clock on a morning in early June she was sitting in the back seat of her mother's Dodge Caravan, wearing her blue Red Sox batting practice jersey (the one with 36 GORDON on the back) and playing with Mona, her doll. At ten thirty she was lost in the woods. By eleven she was trying not to be terrified, trying not to let herself think, This is serious, this is very serious.Trying not to think that sometimes when people got lost in the woods they got seriously hurt.\\"<br /><br />The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon is a near perfect book for the first two thirds of its narration. In the first pages, Trisha walks away from the path while on a family hike in the Adirondacks. The story follows over Trisha's shoulder as she struggles to survive and find her way back. Every word in these scenes bleeds tension, and the book is impossible to put down.<br /><br />After a time, we reach the middle section. Trisha's story to survive is no longer quite as urgent - it's become clear that she's not going to be rescued in the next five pages, but she's not going to be fed to a bear in them, either - but this isn't necessarily such a bad thing. Building a narrative based on monotony's always a dangerous move, for rather obvious reasons, but King successfully walks a fine line and manages to convey the crushing, deadly tedium of a world where you're the only thing who's had a thought more complex than \\"grrr\\" today, without the text becoming an exercise in willpower.<br /><br />It's in these sections where we see the first hints of the supernatural, but, whatever the monster that's pursuing Trisha is, it stays well out of the limelight here. If the cover didn't say Stephen King in such big letters, you might even think the beasty was just a reflection of Tris-ha's terror and loneliness, the need for there to be some other agency at work in such a lawless place, even a malicious force being better than simple bogs and trees and flies.<br /><br />During these pages the focus of the story is still very much Girl in the Woods, not Demons Killing Stuff. Now that the sheer terror of the earlier sections have subsided, King takes the opportunity to show segments of beauty as well as plight, further drawing the reader into Trisha's journey through the wilderness. King cuts back on the flashbacks as the story progresses, while simultaneously deepening Trisha's character considerably.<br /><br />And then we get to the ending, and - who's surprised? - it all goes to hell. At the end of a chapter two-thirds of the way through the book, I put the book down after reading for the past hour, absolutely enthralled. I have no idea where he can possibly go from here, I thought to myself. Well, it turns out that Stephen King didn't know where he should go either. In a few dozen pages literally all tension bleeds out of the narrative. Maybe it's yet another horrible obstacle, yet more hundreds of miles of forests, that breaks it, piling on one too many catastrophes for the result to still hold together. Or maybe it's just that something like this couldn't be kept up forever. I don't know, but while I read the first two-thirds of the book in two sittings, this part took me four or five to muscle through.<br /><br />In inverse proportion with the amount of tension there is in the narrative, you have the supernatural presence. When the Lost in the Woods episode begins to lose its luster, King brings the bogeyman to the fore - and everything falls totally flat. Not for the first time, a monster is what takes the sails out of King's horror, beginning with the nothing-short-of-painful scene where Trisha talks to the representatives of the three gods, the intangible sub-audible, the loving God of Tom Gordon, and the evil-horror-terror God of the Lost.<br /><br />In addition to the growing demonic presence, as The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon progresses, the endless procession of sayings - ranging from those obnoxious faux-adages, to TV jingles - only intensifies. King's love of euphemisms is pretty well established by now, stretching back to his earliest works (remember the capitalized DIVORCE, in The Shining, for instance?). It's not a bad thing in and of itself and is even quite endearing, at times. The problems come to the fore when clich&eacute;s replace description, and truisms replace thought. As far as I can tell, Pepsi is the suburban equivalent of a fortune cookie generator, an utterly blank slate, save for an endless parade of prepackaged sayings. Acknowledging that something is hollow and clich&eacute; doesn't make it meaningful again, and ironic winks grow tiresome when repeated ad nauseam.<br /><br />I haven't even mentioned the actual climax yet. [The rest of this paragraph has SPOILERS; if you want to be totally chaste entering the book, skip to the line break.] You know when you're reading a book, you stop at the one quarter-or-so mark and laugh to yourself about how poorly the author could end it? The problem with reading a newer Stephen King book is that you'll have a prediction...and then it'll actually come true. For instance, what's the worst way that a book about a girl being lost in the woods could end? Her being randomly found through no effort of her own, of course. To make matters worse, it comes right after what could've been a great ending. It was horribly cheesy, of course, but it worked. It was the kind of ending that tugs your heart strings so hard you just can't complain. But no, cheesy-but-excellent wouldn't be climactic enough, so let's bring in the gun toting hunter. Why the hell not? Ugh.<br /><br />The first two thirds of The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon are among the best pages that Stephen King has ever written. As I was reading them, I was mentally listing The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon alongside great works like The Shining and It. And then, I read the ending and was forced to watch as everything I loved about the book was ravished and discarded. I don't know whether I should recommend this book or not. It's not the worst thing that King's written, Everything's Eventual takes that dubious honor with ease, but it disappointed me more than anything else he's done. In the end, I think my recommendation goes like this...<br /><br />Wait a minute. Haven't I said all this before? Right here ([[ASIN:1416552960 Duma Key: A Novel]]), in fact?? You know, I don't know if I can even blame Stephen King anymore. The formula for his later books is pretty damn blatant by now: excellent characterization and pacing, followed by lackluster horror and a god awful ending. I should know what I'm getting into by now, right? By this point, writing that a late era King novel disappointed me makes me feel like I'm going to a restaurant I've always hated, every single night, and complaining that the same dish I've always despised hasn't changed. Well, duh. I think it's time to stop coming back. Next time I'm in the mood for King, I think I'll reread Salem's Lot.g from those obnoxious faux-adages, to TV jingles - only intensifies.

0439023513|3.0|I thought The Hunger Games was just an average ok book. I liked Catching Fire a lot more. Mockingjay sadly didn't improve to the level I was hoping and evaded the wow factor I waas hoping for. It honestly was disappointing. It simply did not live up to all the hype it had received.<br /><br />I felt nothing throughout the entire book until about the last 15 pages, then my emotions were running high. With everything that happens in Mockingjay, I thought my emotions would be going crazy. There was no urge to flip the pages as fast as I could and keep reading to find out the ending.<br /><br />I absolutely adored the last page of the book and the epilogue, but other than that there were no moments I absolutely loved. Sure there were scenes I enjoyed, but after Catching Fire I was expecting a lot more. A lot of parts of the book just seemed under developed. I am just not a fan of the writing. I'm not sure what it is, but me and it simply don't click.<br /><br />This series really for me came down to Peeta. I almost put The Hunger Games down and didn't finish, but then Peeta walked into the story and played a much more active part. Catching Fire largely revolved around Peeta. The parts of Mockingjay I did like tended to be Peeta scenes. I haven't been crazy about the other characters in the series, except for Cinna, Rue, and Peeta. I really am not a fan of Katniss. I didn't like her in The Hunger Games, but thought she rounded out a bit more in Catching Fire. In Mockingjay, I found myself not liking her.<br /><br />While I wasn't crazy that crazy about Mockingjay, Collins did a nice job wrapping up the series. It, to me, was a book that was disappointing, and nothing worth rushing out at midnight to get.
0060557818|5.0|Richard wrote a diary entry in his head.    Dear Diary, he began. On Friday I had a job, a fiancée, a home, and a life that made sense. (Well, as much as any life makes sense.) Then I found an injured girl bleeding on the pavement, and I tried to be a Good Samaritan. Now I've got no fiancée, no home, no job, and I'm walking around a couple of hundred feet under the streets of London with the projected life expectancy of a suicidal fruitfly.     Neverwhere is about the idea that people can slip through the gaps in our modern society and discover a world - still existing in the shadows beneath modern London - that evokes the (literally) magical days of yore. It can easily be read as a condemnation of the modern world. Richard's fiancée, Jessica, is a vapid woman whose interests include going to art museums (with no hint that she cares at all about the art) and going to fancy dinners (calibrated to charm her boss as much as humanly possible). How Richard escapes dreary reality is by an act of compassion, something that few (if any) of the \\"real world\\" characters show in Neverwhere.     London Below is not, however, paradise. After a period of terrifying acclimatization, Richard begins to view it as the vibrant opposite of everything the dreary, callous real world is, but can we really just give into our wishes and vacate reality quite so easily? Gary, Richard's \\"real\\" friend, certainly doesn't think so:    \\"I've passed the people who fall through the cracks, Richard: they sleep in shop doorways, all down the strand. They don't go to a special London. They freeze to death in winter.\\"    Of course, the question of London Below's reality is not central in the narrative. What is important to note, however, is that London Below is not a simple solution to all of Richard's problems. The world of the underground is filled with just as much darkness and evil as London Above, and it's not just of the black and white variety. It's hard to say that the Lord Rat-speaker's disregard for his follower's well being is any better than the emptiness displayed by Richard's coworkers in the book's closing scenes.    London Below is the main \\"character\\" of Neverwhere. It remains throughout the book more of a style than a known quantity, but that fits with the wondrous, magical feelings that Gaiman is trying to evoke. The reader knows that the market meets every night in a different place, and the reader gets to experience the strangeness of the occasion, but (despite Richard's questions) we never find out who sets it up.    The characterization of the other characters in Neverwhere is focused first on theme and setting, second on establishing realistic personalities...which is not to say that it doesn't do both, on occasion. The most interesting character by far is Richard Mayhew, protagonist. He stands in for all of us in the modern age, to a degree, but there is always a slight disconnect between him and the real world scenes, even before his encounter with London Below. His relationship with Jessica consists of absent mindedly doing whatever she says, and his professional life is made remarkable only by the toy trolls that wage war across his desk. When he goes underground, he begins to develop a personality of his own, reacting to both the bizarre stimulus around him and his memories of his life above.    Other characters follow the same general principles, frequently archetypes that are given enough of a twist to appear fresh. Hunter, for instance, is practically obsession personified. She's settled on a goal, and she'd determined to fulfill it at the expense of all else.     In addition to the forces of good, or close enough to it, Neverwhere also boasts two of the best villains ever conceived. Mr. Croup and Mr. Vandemar are blacker-than-black, wolflike in their tenacity, and absolutely hilarious:    \\"'Are you bribing me?' [Varney] asked.    Mr. Vandemar had picked up the morning star. He was pulling the chain apart, with his free hand, linkby link, and dropping the bits of twisted metal onto the floor. Chink. `No,' said Mr. Vandemar. Chink `We're intimidating you.' Chink. `And if you don't do what Mister Croup says, we're...' chink. `hurting you...' chink `...very badly, before we're...' chink `killing you.'    `Ah,' said Varney. `Then I'm working for you, aren't I?'    `Yes, you are,' said Mr. Croup. `I'm afraid we don't have any redeeming features.'    'That doesn't bother me,' said Varney.    'Good,' said Mr. Croup. 'Welcome aboard.'\\"    The entire journey is held together by Gaiman's brilliant prose. Gaiman alternates between description and comedic wording, but both are in evidence here. If the above quotes still haven't convinced you of the greatness of Neverwhere's prose, allow me and Gaiman to try and sway you once more:    \\"They walked through an impressive lobby. Then they waited while the footman lit each of the candles on the candelabra. They went down some impressive richly carpeted stairs. They went down a flight of less impressive, less richly carpeted stairs. They went down a flight of entirely unimpressive stairs carpeted in a threadbare brown sacking, and, finally, they went down a flight of drab wooden stairs with no carpet on them at all.\\"    Neverwhere is not a particularly original book, but Neverwhere is - cliché notwithstanding - about the journey rather than the destination, the dank feel of the air rather than the exact width of the tunnel. It's true that you've probably read a few books like Neverwhere, but how many of them made you look at the real world when you were done reading and recoil at how empty it all seemed? Neverwhere does just that.
1416955070|5.0|City of Bones was a book that kept me up reading late into the night until I couldn't keep my eyes open and then waking up ridiculously early because I had to finish it. City of Bones was definately a book to keep you flipping pages. I could never guess exactly what was coming next, Clare kept you surprised with what she threw at readers.<br /><br />The world Clare created was so vivid. She is heavy on descriptions so you really get the overall picture. At times the description was almost a little much.<br /><br />The characters were so full of life! I loved Jace, he was enjoyable to read about and have a great sense of humor. Alec and Isabelle grow on you as the book go on. At first I found myself not liking them much and almost annoyed with them at first, but then they find a way into your heart. Simon was a really amiable character. Surprisingly, him and Jace were my two favorites. Clary is consistanting reminded of all she must learn, as her world and everything she thought was turned upside down. She was a strong female character.<br /><br />Overall City of Bones is a gripping fantasy that will leave readers heading out the door to get book 2, City of Ashes. A must read for any fantasy lovers out there.
0553573411|5.0|\\"All too often I find I have wandered far from a history of the duchies into a history of FitzChivalry. Those recollections leave me face-to-face with who I once was, and who I have become.\\"    Robin Hobb is, in many ways, a one trick pony. Wait, wait! Don't leave yet. I don't mean that in a particularly negative way. There's nothing wrong with the majority of her style; it's just utterly overshadowed by one aspect. She has less in common with a dog standing on its high legs and more in common with a dog learning to drive a racecar.    As anyone who's ever read Hobb can likely attest, her strength is not plot. Farseer's plot is, ultimately, fairly generic. There is an abandoned bastard son, brought to the castle to serve as an assassin. There are three brothers, two honorable and brave, one spiteful and cowardly. There are barbarian raiders from another land, and there are magics both old and very old. Have I intrigued you yet? No, I thought not.    Her strength is not setting. We're in the Six Duchies, a confederation of six former states, all ruled under one king. The coastal Duchies fish; the inner Duchies farm. There is conflict between the two; the coastal Duchies are reluctant to pay taxes to defend a coastline they do not share. It's thought out better than most of its ilk, I'll admit, but it's still not exactly the kind of thing that you view with your jaw on the floor.    Robin Hobb's strength is character. It's not an intellectual strength; I'm not talking about revolutionary backstories, or motivations, or anything like that. Her strength is visceral. These people feel real in every way possible. We see Verity trying to fill his older brother's shoes, trying to guard the kingdom. He does everything he can, and he is wasting away, and it is not enough. We see him, and we know that he cannot succeed, and he knows he cannot succeed, and yet he cannot - will not - stop.    Fitz is the main character, the aforementioned bastard son of Price Chivalry. He has adepth that can only be had when the reader experiences his growth alongside the author, alongside the character. When we first meet Fitz, he is a blank slate:    \\"My memories reach back to when I was six year old. Before that, there is nothing, only a blank gulf no exercise of my mind has ever been able to pierce. Prior to that day at Moonseye, there is nothing. But on that day they suddenly begin, with a brightness and detail that overwhelms me...\\"    It's said that our experiences shape us, and so it is here. We experience everything that Fitz does, and so is it that surprising that we are shaped in the same way the he is? In book one, we see Fitz develop loyalties in friendships. In book three, these loyalties are tested. The reader cannot look on with detachment, cannot wonder if he will stand fast or not. There is no intellectual contemplation, no thoughts that he should simply bite the bullet and move on. By that point, it is not Fitz that is being tested, at least not wholly. The reader is invested along with him. Every bond that Fitz forges is shown with meticulous detail, and the reader himself becomes friends with Prince Verity, Molly, and Burrich. These friends may not speak to us directly as we read, but there interactions with Fitz are, on every level that matters, interactions with us.    We become so deeply immersed with Fitz that his reasoning becomes our own. I would wager that everyone has had the unsettling experience of having someone tell us our own motivations and realizing that what we thought we were acting for was just blissful, comforting delusion. It is the same experience when Fitz's motivations are called into question. Acts that felt so pure at the time are suddenly given new light, and we feel almost sullied as we contemplate them afresh.    A large portion of your enjoyment of Farseer depends on how much you like to meander. Hobb is anything but direct. I've heard it said that her writing is eighty percent filler, and it's hard to really dispute that claim. All the same, I think that it's the so called filler that makes Hobb worth reading in the first place. The reader lives through Fitz's life, and I do not mean just the important moments. No, the books - and Hobb - shine through the monotony of day to day existence. If you are willing to simply cut yourself loose, to lose yourself in Fitz's existence, you'll find yourself living a life no less complete and complex as your own.    I suppose that that is, quite literally, escapism. All the same, I've never understood the term completely. It's defined as: \\"Habitual diversion of the mind to purely imaginative activity or entertainment as an escape from reality or routine.\\" I suppose I can't argue with that, but the term seems to far more often carry a negative connotation. I've often heard it said that it's taking refuge from the real world. Ignoring the tone of the novel in question, something has never struck me as accurate about this definition. Just because what we're doing does not directly tie into our own lives, why is it inherently meaningless? I'm not defining meaning as a simple recharging of the batteries here, either, though it can do that too. But books can do so much more. Who says that, just because the terms in question are not those of the real world, we are not learning, are not experiencing?    Besides which, if I was going to escape to somewhere else - a Hawaiian vacation for the soul, say - I'd make it somewhere les depressing. The titles and covers all seem quite carefree, but the actual text is anything but. This is, despite all appearances to the contrary, anything but standard fantasy. We are in Fitz's head for his triumphs, yes, but also for his tragedies, and we feel both with equal force. Just because Fitz tries something, and just because Fitz is one of the \\"good guys,\\" does not mean that he will succeed. Be prepared for disappointment of the most bitter flavors while reading.    \\"'I always believed, perhaps childishly, that if you followed the rulers, you would be protected, that things like that would not happen to you. Afterward, I felt...tricked. Foolish. Gullible, that I had thought ideals could protect me. Honor and courtesy and justice...they are not real, Fitz. We all pretend to them, and hold them up like shields. Against those who have discarded them, they are no shields at all, but only additional weapons to use against their victims.'\\"    Of the individual books, the first is at once the one with the fewest flaws and the weakest. The second, by contrast, has glaring problems, and yet it's undoubtedly my favorite. The first book lays down the connections, and it is half the size of the others. It's not focused, no, but it never meanders too much, and we always have our ending goal in sight.    The second, on the other hand, is almost nothing but meander. It's an attempt to preserve the status quo as seen in book one, but for half the text exactly how we're doing so is quite hard to see. That being said, Hobb's writing gets better as it goes on, and every interaction between Fitz and another character only makes the overall story that much deeper.    The third novel is an odd mixture of the two. It should, by all rights, be the most driven. A goal is immediately established, and Fitz sets out to accomplish it. Perhaps because of this, it's the first time where the repetitive nature of the story began to become somewhat irksome. When there's no set destination, I'm fine with exploring every little town that I pass on a long drive. When I'm late for something, however, I'm far more tempted to ram the pedal to the ground and get somewhere. This is not an urge that Hobb shares, and the cycle of Capture-Escape goes on to the point of insanity. At which point we're finally given a break, and the book takes a hard right turn. Everything changes, and it's at once totally brilliant and anything but. The ending is powerful, yes, but also rushed. As it is, it's a decent closing toa brilliant series, but it's impossible to shake the feeling that it could've been an amazing ending.    If you're looking for something exciting, or something uplifting, Farseer is not for you. This isn't about a gripping plot or fascinating locales. This is about people living their lives, and, though it's fantasy through and through, Fitz and Hobb's other creations feel as real to me as anyone I know. If character driven is what you're after, I'm not sure it's possible to do better than this.
0545123275|5.0|Shiver was one of those addicting books that you cannot put down! With the first words, I was hooked. Shiver is a perfect title, because while you read it it kept you \\"shivering\\" from the beautiful imagery Maggie Stiefvater uses. I simply fell in love with basically everything about Shiver. The writing was beautiful and flowing. Maggie Stiefvater adds so much to the story writing in alternating POVs between Sam and Grace.<br /><br />Sam and Grace's relationship was really something! You could feel the intensity of it, especially when Sam was still a wolf. The longing they had for each other was so apparant.<br /><br />All of Shiver's characters were well-written and just seemed to click with the story. Grace was such an amiable character. She was one of those characters that everyone could relate to. Sam was just so sweet and another character you really could relate to. I also really liked Isabel as a character. She played a more minor role but she was such a strong character that she stood out among the others. The one character I would've liked to know a bit more about is Shelby. She is hostile and wants Sam and to be at the \\"top\\", but I didn't feel her as a threat as much as I think she could've been. At different points in the book, they refer to Shelby's past but you never find out what that actually is.<br /><br />Shiver was an absolutely phenomonal start to the trilogy. I cannot wait for Linger, and hear more of Sam and Grace's story!
0345404475|2.0|\\"On his way to work Rick Deckard, as Lord knew how many other people, stopped briefly to skulk about one of San Francisco's larger pet shops, along animal row.\\"    Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? is a Science Fiction classic, the inspiration for Blade Runner, and sports one of the best written blurbs I've ever read. The good ideas don't stop on the back cover. The book tackles several interesting themes and presents a whole host of unique, and well integrated, ideas. Despite all this, Do Androids... fails to live up to its reputation.    The book's cornerstones are the androids and the concept of empathy. As more and more realistic androids are built, it becomes almost impossible to distinguish them from humans. On almost all levels, intellectual, emotional, etc, they conform perfectly to the norm. The humans still on earth are terrified by this. What if, one day, there is an android so advanced that no test, no matter how intricate, can separate them from people? How will they be hunted down, kept separate and subjugated? More importantly - for the reader, if not for the police organizations of future earth - how can we justify hunting down and killing something that is the same as us save for its manner of birth?    Ironically for a book so focused on empathy, where Do Androids... falls short is the prose's ability to convey emotion. Put simply, the text conveys none at all; everything is conveyed in the same listless monotone. Let's imagine a standard metal song, beginning with an acoustic intro. After a minute or two of the introduction, the electric guitar comes in and the feel of the song completely changes. We go from atmospheric and quiet to loud and aggressive. Do Androids... is the equivalent of the entire song played by the acoustic. Yes, the notes are the same, but the feeling's totally changed; it's no longer dynamic in the slightest.    This fundamental lack of vibrancy, of change, in the text hampers it in many ways. Fight scenes and climaxes areboth stripped of their power:    \\"'Why won't my laser tube fire?' [The Android] said, switching on and off the miniaturized triggering and aiming device which he held in the palm of his hand.     'A sine wave,' Rick said. 'That phases out laser emanation and spreads the beam into ordinary light.'    'Then I'll have to break your pencil neck.' The android dropped the device and, with a snarl, grabbed with both hands for Rick's throat.    As the android's hands sank into his throat, Rick fired his regulation issue old-style pistol from its shoulder holster; the .38 magnum slug struck the android in the head and its brain box burst. The Nexus-6 unit which operated it blew into pieces, a raging, mad wind which carried throughout the car. Bits of it, like the radioactive dust itself, whirled down on Rick. The retired remains of the android rocked back, collided with the car door, bounced off, and struck heavily against him; he found himself struggling to shove the twitching remnants of the android away.\\"    The above is supposed to be a thrilling moment, a betrayal, an abrupt ambush-like action scene, and yet the explanatory dialogue dulls the effect entirely. Deckard's reaction to having a gun pointed at him is to explain the precise mechanics preventing his skull from decorating the car door. In addition, the entire affair is over before it can begin. When, after the lackluster opening ripostes are exchanged, the fight begins in earnest, there's barely a paragraph of the android's execution; there isn't time for even the most involved of readers to detect even the faintest whiff of danger before said danger's dispatched, a process matched only in speed by the writing's desire to meander about explaining the cranial anatomy of androids. In this manner, almost all of the book's climaxes are disposed of, after pages of buildup, as a vague flash in the rear view mirror and with the faintest feeling of: that's it?    Worse, the reader is prevented from ever identifying with Deckard at all, not just when he's in mortal danger. Deckard's relationships never draw us in, we never get to develop our own feelings for any of the character's, and we don't truly get to share Deckard's, leaving us with just the shallow knowledge of his physical and verbal response to those around him. As a result, the conflicts of interests, and what should have been the validation of all the novel's themes, falls almost wholly flat.    Furthermore, moving past the prose, there're instances where things seem to be done in order to augment a certain theme, or just for convenience, when it's hard to think of a rational reason for them to be done that way. For instance, there are several companies that make androids. Everyone who goes to Mars - and everyone who isn't dirt poor goes - gets a free android. So, if the demand is on Mars (it is, in fact, illegal to be an android running around on earth), and the companies are rich enough to go (they're described as, essentially, swimming in money), why the hell are they still on earth? In addition, partway through the novel, Deckard stumbles onto a nest of androids. In the middle of the nest is a single human. The man's existence eventually leads to a thematic coup de grace, but I'm unable to think of a single reason for him to be there at all.    Amazingly enough, almost none of these flaws exist when the point of view switches over to John Isidore, a mentally crippled \\"Chickenhead.\\" Contrary to in Deckard's sections (where any semblance of emotion is subtle-ized itself right out of existence), Isidore's moods are painted in broad brushes. The effect can occasionally be comic, but amidst the overacting the character gained my sympathy in a way that no one else in the book came even close to matching. I guess I'm a bigger fan of melodrama than I am of blank stares.    Perhaps a part of my liking for Isidore comes from his job as an ambulance driver for an electric animal company. The obsession with animals was by farmy favorite aspect of Dick's work; it showcases the changes to earth perfectly. The most interesting portion of the entire novel comes from a discussion of the merits of real and mechanical cats.    Approaching the question raised between humans and androids in a totally different way, Dick makes us look a bit closer at our own empathy. The majority of the technology is of a similar vein, seamlessly integrated and fascinating. Perhaps chief among them is the Penfield Mood Organ, a device that dictates your mood upon the dials you push. All of these devices are treated so irreverently by the characters that it often takes several seconds to realize that we don't (yet) have real world equivalents, and all of them are thematically charged to an impressive degree.    Philip K. Dick's Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? is a novel that I failed to connect with on any meaningful level. That being said, it's not a novel that I could advise someone to not read. The book has enough interesting ideas that I can easily see why it's considered such a classic...it's just a pity that those ideas are so let down by the prose.
1416972242|4.0|This next installment of The Mortal Instruments was full of action, suspense, and surprises! I really enjoyed City of Ashes, but it didn't grab me like City of Bones did. City of Ashes was too focused around Jace, and while Jace is a great character, I wanted more of the others. City of Ashes is just full of shockers and moments that will make you gasp.<br /><br />In City of Ashes you really get to know some of the old characters, particularly Jace. While you get to know some characters better, I felt other faded into the background. Isabelle for example is almost never heard from, and I love what she brings to the scenes she's in. You also get introduced to many new characters, one such was Maia, a werewolf who I hope to hear more from!<br /><br />It'll be interesting to see where Jace and Clary's \\"brother-sister\\" relationship goes in the next book. Conflict is hot between the two of them throughout the entire book, and you never know where it will lead.<br /><br />I love the cover for this book! Of the 3 books in the series, this cover is my favorite. I'm sure happy book 3, City of Glass, is already out so I don't have to wait to read it!
B001AIRUOU|5.0|I ordered my movie on the 8th and it was here by the 10th. The movie was in perfect condition. Will definately use this seller again.
0547258305|4.0|I really enjoyed Graceling! It was a beautifully written fantasy with a strong female heroine! All the aspects a good fantasy should have were present. The plot was intriguing with plenty of twists and turns and a slow building romance.<br /><br />I loved the characters. All the characters just glow with life. Katsa, the female heroine of the novel, grew so much throughout the book. Seeing the transformation from page one to the end was very intriguing. Po was my favorite character of the book. He was just a great character overall.<br /><br />The only thing that bugged me was that Katsa was so anti-marriage and that seemed to rule part of her life. She was so afraid of belonging to someone else, but I thought through the novel that trust could've grown.<br /><br />This is definately a must read. I personally cannot wait for the sequel, Bitterblue, Kristan Cashore has planned!
0767020308|4.0|Having seen the Paltrow and Garai versions of Emma and not particularly liked the story, I didn't expect much from this film.  In fact, I was pleasantly surprised. Despite the many reviews saying this was poorly cast, I completely disagree.  I think it was the best cast version yet - my only drawback being that there wasn't much chemistry between Emma and Knightley. Enough for me to buy the plot, but not enough to make me really love it (I concede Paltrow's version has the best Emma/Knightley chemistry).<br /><br />The reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 was because the film was too short!  In making it short they (in my opinion) rushed the storyline.  I was glad to be well familiar with the story to be able to keep my bearings - especially at the beginning.<br /><br />A very enjoyable version and one I will love to own... (I do not own the Garai version as I find her portrayal of Emma painful since it reflects far more of the behavior of modern women than those of the time.)
0439023483|3.0|I think I'm about the last person on the planet earth to read this book, and also about the first person not to absolutely adore these books. I had been told to read them for ages, particularly from Gail. The last 100 pages or so is really what redeemed it for me.<br /><br />My big issue with this book was the writing. It seriously almost made me put it down, but every time I was about to do that, the book would redeem itself slightly. The first third to half of the book was awfully slow. It was slow reading, but at the same time intriguing. I didn't really understand all of what was going on, so I wanted to know everything.<br /><br />I loved the characters. Most of them all had such depth and were wonderful. Rue was absolutely my favorite character of the book. I adored her. Peeta was a character I liked right off the bat. Katniss was an interesting character, but I found her a bit annoying. I just didn't like her thoughts. I found her flat and I didn't like her at all.<br /><br />Another thing about The Hunger Games I really did like was the world. I thought it was simply fascinating and I loved how Collins set it up.<br /><br />This was overall a good read, but it just didn't live up to what I thought it would be. I have heard nothing but glowing things for it, and while I loved all the character (minus Katniss some of the time) and thouht the plot was original and intriguing, the plot was slower and I really wasn't a fan of the writing. The ending though, was ace, and has me extremely excited for Catching Fire.
0374158460|2.0|The title of this book should have been \\"Freedom for people to make bad choices and be miserable\\". It's a depressing book. I really wanted to like it, but even after reading the first 150 pages I had a sense the book wasn't going anywhere, but I trudged on anyway, page after page, until the end, waiting for a good experience, anything interesting, especially since I had enjoyed Franzen's last book The Corrections. And I'm not looking for novels to deliver a \\"feel good\\" experience either, nor do I need to \\"love\\" every character. But these characters are all miserable, depressed, and regretful. And there is nothing interesting about the plot, or setting, to balance out the miserable characters. Don't get me wrong, Franzen is a good writer, and he may deliver better books in the future. Maybe if you're a pessimist, or skeptic, you'll love this book. But I expected more from a writer of Franzen's caliber.
2070364232|5.0|This book was for summer reading for school.  Instead of chasing the book down in town and paying more for it, I opted for ordering the book online.  The book was just as the shipper had stated it would be, and it arrived more quickly than I had expected.  I was happy and so was the reader.
B002BSHXJA|5.0|I purchased the Mono version of these albums after reading other reviews that said the sound was better on this one than the stereo box set.  But I did not get blast out of your speakers sound with it, as a matter of act I didn't really get the feeling of what it used to sound like when I heard these songs on the radio so that was a bit of a disappointment for me.  Maybe it's the equipment I'm listening to them on.      Also if you buy the Mono box set you don't get the last three albums which were released in Stereo only.  Two of the albums have the mono tracks followed by the stereo remaster of that same album (Rubber Soul) is one of the two and I could tell no difference between the mono version and the stereo version so I did not feel I received extra quality in purchasing the Mono box set.  My opinion is if you are not an audiofile collector you probably would do better to just go and buy the Stereo box set and get all the albums at once.      The presentation of this set is phenominally nice however, with a small plastic sleeve that fits into a mock paper sleeve that fits into the album cover reproduction cd sleeve, this should help preserve the cds for a long time.  I purchased Abbey Road and Let It Be in their remastered single editions and they did not provide the same loving care as in the box set, I'm tempted to fashion my own plastic sleeve to go inside the cd sleeve to provide some extra protection for the cd so that I never have to buy it again.  Once upon a time I purchased the vinyl blue box set of the Beatles albums and paid dearly for it, I never want to have to purchase this music again.

B000MRAAJM|5.0|I love how people who gave this a bad rating are either rating the HD DVD version, got a bad or incomplete copy from the seller, or are just downright stupid (no offense). I just read on that said \\"HD DVD will not play in my Multi-Function Blu Ray player\\". Hmm... I wonder why. Maybe you'd have more luck using the VCR?    Anyway, I also own the HD DVD version (but am in the process of switching it to a Blu Ray through [...]), but have also seen the Blu Ray version. Basically, anything David Attenborough narrates is gold (at least from what I have seen).    That aside, this series is spectacular. The narration is top-notch, but even better is the crystal clear HD. It is among the best I have ever seen and is worth every penny. On top of that, the series is very entertaining and informative. My personal favorite is \\"Deep Ocean\\" (I love stuff about the abyss... way below where humans are capable of going.).    If you have not seen this series, get on it! Also recommended is the series \\"Life\\" (also a Discovery Channel series narrated by Davis Attenborough).
081297381X|4.0|I gave The Black Swan a high rating simply because it makes you think, which (I believe) is what the author intended.  If you're looking for a book of the variety \\"four easy steps to...\\" then this one is definitely not for you.    The book deals with extreme events and human actions and how data is misinterpreted in decision making and particularly risk management.    The author (Taleb) basically demolishes conventional economic thought and how the use of the bell curve and traditional statistics causes undue risk taking (think Long-Term Capital Management).  The book seems very relevant going forward.    In my humble opinion, I think Mr. Taleb overcomplicates the subject. In parts, reading the book was like talking with one of my friends who always seems to \\"make a short story... long.\\"   The author also appears to be overly impressed with his ability to site obscure 19th century and earlier thinkers to support his ideas, which ironically he warns other writers against.      The beginning part of the book is drawn out (and dry) so make sure you get through these chapters.  Couldn't put the book down after that.      In summary, the book is well worth reading. It will stimulate your thought process.

B001ECQ75A|5.0|Kung Fu Panda is the type of movie that makes you smile from start to finish. With its clever dialogue, great animation and terrific acting, it makes for a very satisfying movie for kids and adults alike. View it once or multiple times (as I did) and Jack Black is still as funny as they come. Just a perfect movie and highly recommended!
0767810856|5.0|Romantic story at it's best.  Love Brigit Fonda and Nic Cage, but Rosie Perez steals the movie.  Must see.
B0000A1RJI|5.0|I think movie soundtracks have the power to awaken one's imagination and evoke the correct period feelings. \\"Pirates of the Caribbean\\" does such a job, and magnificently. James Horner balances the swashbuckling theme with an epic flair and just a touch of comedy to create the exact feel for this movie. Terrific combination!
076781214X|5.0|I have always loved this movie,  It has a timeless story and great understanding of what if?
B002ZG98UA|5.0|I don't usually write reviews or let other reviews make my descisions. Wait for it... But this film was incredible in IMAX 3-D. I'm a fan of the series so I came in knowing what to expect. I won't go in to details on plot as others have done that already. If your looking for a mind blowing (check your brain at the door) movie, than go see this. Enjoy!

B003S9W8EQ|1.0|This book is pure trash. Sorry.    The \\"Pillars of the Earth\\" was good historical fiction. But this book is so wrong that it might be fun to read if it would not take itself so seriously. Others have already pointed out that the characters are just clones of the \\"Pillars\\", but it is even worse: the characters really behave like out of a sitcom from the \\"zero years\\". And: sorry, Ken, but oral sex was just not as popular in the 14th century than you make us believe ...
1416550534|4.0|I picked up this book because I had enjoyed The Forgotten Garden and I was pleased to find Morton's earlier novel was also a lovely read.  I don't consider myself a mystery fan but I find I do enjoy novels that are more of a character study with a mystery thrown in that helps explain the characters further.      The story is told by Grace, now an elderly woman who was a servant for the family at Riverton estate.  She tells of both the staff and the main family with particular focus on two daughters who are her peers in terms of age but very differently situated by class and social standing.    I enjoyed the rounded, fleshed out characters and the contrasts drawn between life in service and in higher society, as well as the parallel limiting effect of social expectations on both classes.  It wasn't the mystery that kept me reading but more an interest in the characters and the enjoyment of the prose.  It is a fairly quick read but I was sorry to see the end pages approach and wanted to \\"stay longer\\" in the story.      I'd be tempted to go to 4.5 stars if offered but am not quite ready to round up to 5 stars (I tend to save that for more complex, more literary books)
1591396190|3.0|Good book at the conceptual level.  The main idea is to identify new market where no competetion exists and establish your company.  I find the book to be more inspiring than practical.  The frameworks used are not original and I found them very academic.
B001EN71CW|5.0|Never saw it before, got it because it got so many great reviews. I saw Serenity first.  I watched the whole series in like 3 or 4 days because I couldn't stop watching. I also got it for my brother.  Great buy.
0307266303|5.0|I can't believe how much I loved this book.  Easily the best book about running I have ever read.  I was actually sad when I finished it...I wanted it to just keep going on!  Makes so much sense about things that every runner has wondered about or dealt with personally.  Simply outstanding!  It's worth every penny and then some.  This book brings back so much excitement and wonder I used to have for running but have lost.  I feel rejuvenated and can't wait to apply what I learned from reading this book!
B001UV4XWY|1.0|Ouch this was a BAD movie !!<br /><br />It started off very, very good.<br /><br />But then all of a sudden, they apparently started trying to throw in every Sci-Fi angle they could think of.<br /><br />Take every episode of Twilight Zone and Outer Limits you can think of .......  put it in a blender ......... filter out the best parts ...... and then whatever silly sludge is left over use to make \\"The Box\\".<br /><br />We watched this with some close friends (we have them over twice per month for dinner and movie night).<br /><br />This movie had the whole room groaning and laughing on the floor making comments like ...... \\"Ouch this is really bad.

B0007DFJ0G|5.0|From the opening sequence of Fight Club, you know you are in for a wild ride. It takes you right inside a brain, synapses firing, fear response triggered. Really cool music. You know it is CGI, but it looks like you are right inside the old grey matter. It looks like they spent a lot of money, and they did. The opening sequence was budgeted separately from the rest of the film. If they liked what they saw, then they would spring for the sequence the way that director David Fincher wanted it. They came, they saw, they liked, they sprang.<br /><br />Fight Club, the film, is the story of a book by Chuck Palahniuk that would seem an unlikely source for a film. It wasn't as if he wrote it with the idea of selling the film rights, but certain people with rare vision could see it had potential. What were the sources of the ideas for the book?<br /><br />Author Chuck Palahniuk first came up with the idea for Fight Club after being attacked on a camping trip when he had the temerity to complain to some unhappy campers about their noisy radio. When he returned to work he found that nobody would acknowledge his injuries, instead saying such banal things as \\"How was your weekend?\\" Palahniuk concluded that people reacted this way because if they asked him what had happened, a degree of personal interaction would be necessary, and his workmates simply didn't care enough to get involved, or were afraid of someone who spent their weekends getting into fist fights. It was his fascination with this societal 'blocking' which became the foundation for the novel.<br /><br />He chose the name Tyler Durden after the character of Toby Tyler in Toby Tyler, or Ten Weeks with a Circus (1960), a book that was also made into a Disney movie, and a man called Durden with whom Palahniuk worked, who was fired for sexual harassment. Marla Singer was named after a girl who used to bully Palahniuk's sister in school.<br /><br />Much of the specific content of the novel (such as splicing single frames of pornography into family films, attending support groups for the terminally ill, erasing video tapes, etc.) came from stories told him by friends, and from things his friends actually did. Whilst writing the novel, Palahniuk also interviewed numerous young white males in white-collar jobs, discovering that \\"the longing for fathers was a theme I heard a lot about. The resentment of lifestyle standards imposed by advertising was another.\\" So, in a nut shell, the themes of Fight Club are the longing for a father figure, and anti-consumerism.<br /><br />With the cult status of Fight Club, has the film itself become just another consumer product?<br /><br />----------------<br />Narrator: When deep space exploration ramps up, it'll be the corporations that name everything, the IBM Stellar Sphere, the Microsoft Galaxy, Planet Starbucks.<br />===========<br /><br />Director David Fincher said in an interview in UK film magazine Empire, that there is a Starbucks coffee cup visible in every shot in the movie. Starbucks didn't mind this rampant product placement, but drew the line at a scene where a 'corporate coffee bar' was destroyed along with some corporate art as part of Project Mayhem. Starbucks pulled their name from the scene and the gold globe sculpture crashes into a shop named Gratifico Coffee.<br /><br />----------<br />Tyler Durden: If you could fight anyone, who would you fight?<br />Narrator: Shatner. I'd fight William Shatner.<br />========<br /><br />Chuck Palahniuk told the producers from the very start that, although he fully supported the adaptation, he wasn't interested in writing the screenplay himself. Initially, producer Laura Ziskin considered hiring Buck Henry to adapt the novel, due to the many thematic similarities between Fight Club and The Graduate (1967). I don't really see the similarities. However, Jim Uhls was chosen as the writer instead of Buck Henry. Cameron Crowe (Almost Famous, Vanilla Sky), Andrew Kevin Walker, director David Fincherand actors Brad Pitt and Edward Norton also did uncredited work on the screenplay. Pitt and Norton improvised some dialogue, and added other little touches. At one point, when the Narrator, played by Norton, knocks on the door to complain that Tyler and Marla are making too much noise Pitt answers wearing a yellow rubber glove, and asks him if he wants to join them. The studio wanted to cut this, but it got big laughs at test screenings. Brad Pitt also provided much of his own wardrobe.<br /><br />--------<br />Narrator: Tyler's not here. Tyler went away. Tyler's gone.<br />======<br /><br />Fox 2000 Pictures executive Raymond Bongiovanni, who died shortly before the project was green-lit, first discovered the book whilst still in galleys. Prior to his death, Bongiovanni worked tirelessly to get the project off the ground, and in his obituary, it said that his last wish was that the novel be made into a film. It was Raymond Bongiovanni who sent it to Laura Ziskin, President of Production at Fox 2000 Pictures. She felt it was a tremendous piece of literature, but not necessarily a great movie. The book was sent to a studio reader to evaluate its potential as a possible film, and the report sent back to Ziskin dissed the novel, saying it could never be made into a film, that it was \\"exceedingly disturbing\\", \\"volatile and dangerous\\", and would \\"make audiences squirm\\". Somehow, the bad report made certain people all the more determined to do the film, convinced that they had a hold of some really provocative material.<br /><br />-------------<br />The movie's line \\"The first rule of Fight Club is you do not talk about Fight Club\\" was #27 of \\"The 100 Greatest Movie Lines\\" by Premiere in 2007.<br />==========<br /><br />This film was made prior to the events of September 11, 2001, and one wonders if it could have even been made afterwards. One event that did occur after filming that dramatically changed the way test audiences reacted was the Columbine School shootings. The scene where the narrator threatens his boss got laughs at test screenings, but afterwards, was not so funny. Though the film did gather quite a cult following, I don't think that it inspired anyone to do anything--to copy cat Tyler Durden. No one started any Fight Clubs that I know of, unless they followed the first and second rules of Fight Club and didn't talk about it. No Project Mayhems were inspired by Fight Club to my knowledge.<br /><br />-----------<br />Tyler Durden: We're the middle children of history, man. No purpose or place. We have no Great War. No Great Depression. Our Great War's a spiritual war... our Great Depression is our lives. We've all been raised on television to believe that one day we'd all be millionaires, and movie gods, and rock stars. But we won't. And we're slowly learning that fact.<br />========<br /><br />Edward Norton was an inspired casting choice. He had gained a lot of weight to play  skin head in American History X, but he lost it for Fight Club to play the more cerebral narrator. The novel Fight Club is largely an interior monologue taking place inside the narrator's head, and voice over can sometimes not go over so well in a film, where you want to show rather than tell. Here though, it worked perfectly, due to Norton's dry delivery.<br /><br />---------<br />Narrator: I am Jack's cold sweat.<br />========<br /><br />Brad Pitt was also an inspired casting choice as Tyler Durden. As I've said, he provided his own costumes from his personal wardrobe. The clothes that Tyler Durden wears are flashy, tacky--perfect for someone who would answer the door wearing a yellow rubber glove. He really understands Tyler Durden and delivers with gusto. I think that Fight Club is some of his best work. He was kind of out there in 12 Monkeys, but that movie wasn't firing on all pistons like Fight Club. His 12 Monkeys was kind of a gallant attempt that failed. Snatch? Give me a break. He approached Fight Club level as the killer Early Graycein Kalifornia, but Tyler is such a rich and complex character that it leaves all of his other roles in the dust.<br /><br />--------<br />Tyler Durden: I want you to hit me as hard as you can.<br />======<br /><br />Helena Bonham Carter makes a great Marla Singer.

B00275EGWY|2.0|I think HURT LOCKER would have been very good if it had been filmed authentically as a genuine documentary with a crew following around actual military personnel.<br /><br />As it is, it has a very synthetic and unrealistic \\"movie\\" feel to it.<br /><br />I am sure other ex- military people will agree.
B000V86OKG|3.0|The show itself is amazingly enjoyable and I recommend the series to everyone.<br /><br />However...<br /><br />I own all the seasons on DVD and this one FORCES you to sit through a near minute long Showtime ad BEFORE EACH EPISODE! You can not skip passed it, and choosing the \\"play all\\" option will not stop it either.<br />I realize that Showtime wants to pimp its other programs, and entice you to suscribe to thier channel, it IS a business afterall. The problem I have with this way of doing it is that:<br /><br />A. It's the exact same ad every time and it's just various actors from the promoted series' shown on screen as music plays and the show titles are displayed. No scenes from the promoted shows to give a \\"taste\\" of why you might like that series, nor even an explaination of what the individual shows are about. In other words it's like a bad music video. I am truly at a loss as to why they thought making it so uninformative AND unskippable was a wise marketing tactic?<br /><br />B. Since you have to wait for the ad to finish before watching the episodes, it might weaken the enjoyment people have for this season; a season they paid to watch!<br /><br />If that was all that I felt displeased about, I might have given it 4 stars. There is another gripe that I have though. And it is this...<br /><br />Some of the \\"bonus\\" features stated on the packaging can ONLY be played by putting the disk into your computer's DVD drive. While this is not an uncommon thing, it IS misleading to not state it on the packaging. Plus, you are required to use additional software to view them! So how is this a \\"bonus\\" when it's not technically on the disk in the first place? I would have been much more pleased if they had simply stated on the packaging something like: \\"Insert Disk 4 into your computer's DVD-ROM and get access to the following Bonus Features.\\" At least then a consumer knows what they are really paying for.<br /><br />These were my two gripes, which is why I elimited a star for each.
B0038Z5T4Q|4.0|I had not watched the film in years until I bought this DVD.  Watched it on 9-11-10 so when you see the twin towers at the beginning of the film.    A film for it's time & it is Michael's movie for his Best Actor winner role.  His 2cd Oscar.  I am NOT a fan of Charlie Sheen never have been so of course I did not like him in this film.  Sean Young & Daryl Hannah after \\"Blade Runner\\" working together again, this time in the same scene.    Sean's character was a spoiled I do nothing let the servants do it trophy wife.  Hannah's character WAS NOT NEEDED IN THE FILM.    What was the point of this character?  To design Bud's new apartment with UGLY ART WORK & BAD COLOR PAINT.  Time could have been saved in NOT having this character in here-WAS NOT NEEDED.  DID NOTHING TO THE STORY.  And, of course, Sean & Daryl's movie career was pretty much over when the 1980's ended.  James Spader doing a James Spader role-done this bit how many times James?    Rereleased to promote the 2cd film.  Now Gordon is supposed to have a daughter in the new film, looks like a guy in a dress.  In this original film they have a son & the KID LOOKED NOTHING LIKE THEM.  Both of them were fit, the kid over weight.  Oliver Stone let this gaffe in the 2cd film to happen.  Bad job Oliver.    I like the film but this DVD is POOR.  Extras, what extras?  Where is a making of the film?  The extras are a joke but as long as they get to promote the new film....    And, no chapter list & IT HAS ONE OF THESE CHEAP PLASTIC DVD CASES WITH THE INTENTIONAL HOLES IN THEM.  THESE ARE CHEAP & CAN DAMAGE THE DVD'S.  WHOEVER DESIGNED THESE IS AN IDIOT & WHATEVER DVD DESIGNER WHO USES THEM IS AN IDIOT AS WELL.      Review for film NOT DVD package  That would be a 0 if they had that rating.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|Some reviews on here have stood upon their high horse and tried to display this show as promoting the actions of a psychopath, that Dexter is a hypocrite by punishing people for killing by killing them.<br /><br />These people apparently have not been paying attention as they watched this series, or they would see that this is far from promoting the actions of a seriel killer.<br /><br />First of all, Dexter doesn't just kill people simply because these people are killers; he follows a code of conduct, a set of rules and guidelines, to determine who he kills. One part of his code is that there MUST be evidence that the killer will likely kill again. In other words; he is actually picky about who he kills. He doesn't kill someone because they did him wrong, or for any selfish reason at all; he kills those that managed to manipulate the system or got off through a technicality, or who killed potential witnesses against them. There is never any reasonable doubt that the killer is innocent or else Dexrer will not kill them. This is not promoting seriel killing as much as it's promoting restraint and certainty in something before you take action against someone.<br /><br />Since this review is supposed to be about the first season, I shall refrain from commenting on how Dexter evolves through theother seasons and stick tojust this first season.<br /><br />Dexter has this \\"darkness\\" inside of him, a darkness that he was not born with but grew out of a very horrific childhood event that he witnessed. And while he is a seriel killer, he puts forth great effort to lead as normal a life as he can. While perhaps your life is not as dark as Dexter's is, we all can relate to something from our childhood that we still carry with us (perhaps even a few things), and our attempts to find peace and fulfillment in our adult lives despite it. So in a very real way, Dexter is our extreme self; we \\"kill\\" people in our thoughts, Dexter kills people literally. He works hard to be an understanding and supportive boyfriend, despite his inability to actually feel the \\"normal\\" emotions that they contain. And despite being a psychopath, he still wants to honor what his adoptive father taught him. His adoptive sister is an emotional, co-dependant wreck, yet he never abandons her or betrays her.<br /><br />Sure, this show is far from a warm fuzzy morality tale...then again, can't the same be said about real life? While you may not have killed anyone, you have likely done something that you have excused by saying, \\"That's just who I am.\\" Be it having a knack for picking the wrong relationships, or doing drugs or drinking alot, or frequently getting into fights, or an inability to be close to people, or any of a number of things that are \\"you\\" that you know is not the best life that you can have.<br /><br />Dexter is living through an addiction, and at the same time he is searching for what it would be like to feel \\"normal.\\" To me, that speaks to what most of us are searching for.<br /><br />So give this series a chance with that in mind. If you just can't get passed the killing aspect, then this is simply not a show for you.<br /><br />That's My Opinion But You're Welcome To It.d, despite his inability to actually feel the \\"normal\\" emotions that they contain.

B0026OE2NY|1.0|Very disappointed. We purchased the DVD via the Australian Amazon Website only to find that we received a version which can only be played in Region 1 (USA). When we tried to play it in Australia (Region 4) the DVD did not work. It is now sitting at home and can't be viewed.  Why can't Amazon identify the obvious when it takes an order and asks for the postal address by sending a DVD with the correct Region setting. Any opportuniuty for a swap with the correct region setting would be much appreciated. Otherwise it has been a total waste of money. Otherwise i understand from what I have heard the DVD is a great view.
0817439390|5.0|Understanding Exposure is an excellent book written in an easily readable and understandable explanation on how to think about exposure.  It covers how to think about the apeture needed and how to adjust your vision by seeing what apeture will provide the best shot.  It also includes some exercises that help refine not only your ability to see light but to think about how to use it.  This book is an excelent book and will be useful for all but the most seasoned pros.
B002ZTQVGQ|5.0|This is a great kids movie. The animation is wonderful, the story is heartwarming and their are some very nice messages about social responsibilities...
0307454541|2.0|This book has lots of violence towards women (a reflection of our society I suppose) and is very disturbing. The story kept me captivated and the writing was good but it was still very depressing. It is good there is some revenge aspects and a stronger female character but still it had some unrealistic twists (yeah like every women would want to sleep with the male lead character- come on!). I just don't buy that the female lead would want to sleep with the male lead. The typical male character who gets all the women I guess. Of course violence and sex always sells. Warning: lots of sexual violence and not for young readers!
0307454541|4.0|After having multiple people shove this book at me insisting I read it, I picked it up reluctantly.  The first 100 pages, in all honestly was some of the most boring fiction I've ever read.  I was told this was true and kept going.  It turned into a very good, albeit disturbing book.  I was hooked & quickly picked up the second book.  Definitely don't allow younger teens to read this book- even for adults the sexual violence is awful.
B002RI9ZQ8|5.0|i was struggling to put this book down even if exhausted. It has a heart with touching characters and a rapid beat. A masterpiece.
B002JVWR9U|5.0|Spoiler free! This review only contains background information and general information.     I was skeptical of this show at first, because I was told that it is a teen drama. Since I am 28, this did not appeal to me, until a 32 year old friend of mine showed me some clips from the show. I immediately had to watch it. While the first episode did seem a bit juvenile, the show quickly started to transition, and I would not hesitate to say now that this show is made for adults. While there are 22 episodes, one could easily sit down and watch each 45 minute episode back-to-back on a lazy Saturday... it would be worth the sleep deprivation. The Vampire Diaries has quickly become my favorite show (in case it helps you, my other favorite shows are Dexter, True Blood, Buffy, Veronica Mars, Bones...).     So which audience is this show for? The CW targets the show towards 18-34 year old women. Yes, you read that right; this is not supposed to be a teen show (although they can watch it and enjoy it).     The show centers around a small town (yes, the town is one of the main characters) called Mystic Falls. About 145 years ago, vampires existed in this town, but then the townspeople who knew about their existence torched them. Some escaped and moved to other places. Most of the current townspeople don't know that vampires exist.    I think the actor who shines the most in his role is Paul Wesley who plays Stefan Salvatore, the eternal 17 year old vampire. Stefan has returned to Mystic Falls because of a teenage human named Elena who looks identical to an evil vampire named Katherine he loved, who was killed 145 years ago. Not to worry, the actor is 28 in real life, and he doesn't look like a teenager, so you won't have to worry about feeling like a cougar. Stefan is a lot like Angel from Buffy, because he broods and hates himself because of what he is; he refuses to drink human blood. He also has secrets and regrets, which he thinks about daily. You could think of him as the vampire with a soul if you wanted. Although he plays the sweet vampire, you can still sense (actually it will come out temporarily) that he has a dark side and could possibly be a bad boy if he wanted to. His acting prowess shows even more in season 2 when he gets over his issues and embraces his true nature.    Ian Somerhalder plays Damon Salvatore who is Stefan's older vampire brother. This is the true bad boy. Well, the bad boy with a heart. Not a heart of gold, but he does have some humanity. Damon is the prime reason why some people I know watch this show. Actually, it's hard to tell if it's because of Damon or Somerhalder himself. Damon has come back to Mystic Falls for a couple reasons: to make Stefan's life hell and another reason which will be revealed later in the show. You see, Damon was also in love with Katherine and he can't live with the fact that Katherine turned Stefan into a vampire, since he thought that Katherine only loved him and wanted to share eternity with only him.    Elena, played by Nina Dobrev (of Degrassi fame), is a 17 year old who has just lost her parents in a car accident. She feels dead inside, but then she meets Stefan and he fills the void. No, this isn't going to be just like Twilight (the Vampire Diaries is a unique story--it has a bite). Elena might not only end up with one suitor, because just like Katherine, she has more than one admirer. The viewer has to wonder if there is foreshadowing involved when Elena is warned that as long as she has a Salvatore brother on each arm, she's doomed. This love triangle is very subtle the first season, but it's impossible to miss. Again, another prime reason why some viewers tune in.     The secondary characters are just as interesting and fun to watch, so while there are many story lines, none of them are boring.     Watch this show for the great storytelling, Paul Wesley's acting, the eye candy, the love triangle, or for your favorite character (because you will have at least one and there is great character development).
B0015DWJX2|4.0|I passed this book up for a year because of the title.  What a silly thing to do.  I thoroughly enjoyed this charming glimpse into a small society during challenging times.  The style (told through letters) was a bit strange at first until you become a little familiar with all the players, but it evokes a sense of time when communication wasn't as instantaneous as we're used to today.  Since reading it my extended family  (sisters, parents, aunts, uncles) have picked it up (some on my recommendation, some through others), and all have enjoyed it.
B002BU0DPE|1.0|I bought these for use with my Xbox 360 to replace my old headset. Great sound quality, very comfortable, but there are two serious problems: The mic cable included doesn't work, right out of the box, and the sounds that come from in front of you in a game are very, very quiet. I am very disappointed with this product and probably won't buy another Turtle Beach headset. I'm going to get a refund on these if I don't receive a replacement cable, and buy a Tritton AX180 headset.
B00012QM8G|1.0|The movie is great; this review is just a warning that this is a TWO-SIDED DISC!!! Half the movie on one side, the rest on the other!!! I see they've added a notice now...wish they'd had it before I ordered it...oh well.

0374158460|5.0|Everything you've come to expect from Jonathan Franzen, and more, because unless you're in the middle of one of his novels, you forget what it's like.  He writes completely original yet relatable characters.  I'll wade in on the politics:  GOOD FOR JONATHAN FRANZEN that he's bring habitat destruction and ZPG into the national debate.  He does not do this in a preachy way at all-- it's entirely on-character and thrillingly connected to the story.  I'll admit that the book kind of bogged down at the 3/4 point, and I wasn't entirely satisfied with the ending.  And it's a little more disciplined than THE CORRECTIONS, and I mean that in a bad way.  I loved the cut-loose energy of that book, and I found it missing in FREEDOM.  Still, JF is the greatest writer out there, and I wish all these naysayers would just get over themselves.  All I can think of to say is THANK YOU, JF, for a real good time.
B002WIDRM6|5.0|The title of my review says it all!!  I love Lady Antebellum and consider them among the best artists around.  I don't usually buy a lot of cds, but when I heard \\"I Run to You\\" on the radio last year, I had to buy the cd!  That cd didn't disappoint and neither does this one.
6300216047|3.0|This VHS recording was every bit as described by the seller.  For its age, it was in remarkable condition and I am very happy with my purchase.    Needless to say, Jane Fonda is just as hokey as I remembered her to be and I had a lot of laughs at her expense.  Needless to say, this movie was made long before she learned how to act, and her amateurish performance shows it.    She has improved greatly since I first saw this bomb at the local drive-in movie way back when I was courting my second wife, and before I was drafted and sent to Nam, where Janie made her biggest mistake when she became Hanoi Jane.  I still hear disparaging remarks about her whenever I attend a VFW meeting.  Those guys will never forget how she turned her back on us.    I have a problem with rating.  As a movie, it stinks because it's so hokey, but as a source of laughs, it's great.  So I'm going right down the middle.    End of lecture.

B003ZUTVJS|5.0|I just watched this movie on my computer and I think this will be one of my all time favorite movies!  This is a wonderful and moving story on so many levels.  Some would consider Temple Grandin handicapped when in truth she is truly gifted.  She has made great contributions to the cattle industry and also the humane treatment of animals.  Seeing things through Temple's eyes was truly enlightening.  Claire Danes was superb and also the rest of the cast did a very fine job!  I was glued to my seat and thought the story flowed well.

B001992NUQ|5.0|Oh the movie males of the 1999/2000. Neo from The Matrix, Lester Burnham from American Beauty, Peter Gibbons from Office Space, The Narrator from Fight Club, Patrick Bateman of American Psycho. All of these men have the same thing in common. At the start of their respective movies, they're living in their own personal hell and are facing crises that must be remedied. Neo finds the Matrix, Lester finds beauty in the world, Peter steals from his company, while The Narrator & Patrick turn to more primal methods of coping. Sometimes the cause from these crises is due to consumerism, but it is often brought on by familiarity, which of course breeds contempt.<br /><br />Fight Club & American Psycho are the perfect companions for each other however, as they both contain all the above themes, and both deal with primal remedies that deal with madness and insanity in a world that inevitably breeds madness and insanity. American Psycho deals with the 80s, and how the Yuppie culture essentially created a bunch of consumerist clones. Fight Club deals with the late 90s/00s and how society has essentially made us into a bunch of wimps due to our lack of societal hardships to rise against. Where American Psycho leaves off, Fight Club takes and runs with. For the purposes of this review however, we shall analyse Fight Club.<br /><br />The Narrator is caught in a world of familiarity. He travels and gets to see America, but it's all the same to him. He works for a terrible and probably selfish company, and when he's in an office environment, it's soul-sucking. As a result, he can't sleep, and his lack of sleep is a reflection of his life's familiarity, and this familiarity starts breeding contempt, so he starts attending support groups so he can let his emotions through tears. And for a year, this actually work, and it probably would have kept working too if it hadn't been for Marla. Truly, Marla Singer set into motion the events of the rest of the movie because without her, The Narrator is perfectly content to cry his frustrations and emotions away. But since she is a distraction, his life is messed up again, so he takes the philosophical route. In the moment, right after the line \\"If you wake up at a different time in a different place, could you wake up as a different person?,\\" Tyler Durden appears. Bingo. The Narrator has just found the ultimate form of societal rebellion.<br /><br />You see, The Narrator/Tyler Durden sees society as a bunch of wimpy zombies. Rendered numb by society. Wondering around because they don't know what else to do. They take the easy path because it's the only path they've ever been on. The rebellion starts out small at first, with fighting. Then it turns into guerilla terrorism. But then, it all goes to hell. At some point, something went wrong. \\"His Name is Robert Paulson.\\" Those are the words that send a wake-up call to The Narrator. Something has gone horribly wrong. He's been working for a way to free society from being zombies, yet he's created an ultimate army of zombies. The first rule of Fight Club is to never talk about Fight Club, yet everywhere he goes, everybody knows about Fight Club. Tyler Durden is just a name. A figment of an imagination. A shadowy figure that was born and resides only in legend. Thus, as The Narrator stands holding hands with Marla, watching the improbable financial collapse of America, there's no redemption except for death. He's gone on a journey to escape his own personal hell only to create another one, even more personal than the last, even worse because it's of his own doing. He can kill Tyler Durden, but Tyler Durden still lives on in all that's been created. There's no way to dissolve Project Mayhem. There's no way to stop the financial collapse. There's no way to live with himself. This is the cautionary tale of Fight Club. The tale of a man so numb, he took punches just to feel something, and wanted the rest of the world to be free. But with freedom comes a price, and aprice that defeats the freedom in first place.<br /><br />The story is well-put together, brilliantly written, stunningly put-together, perfectly acted, hilarious, memorable, and most of all, thought-provoking, Fight Club is a quasi-modern masterpiece.freedom in first place.    The story is well-put together, brilliantly written, stunningly put-together, perfectly acted, hilarious, memorable, and most of all, thought-provoking, Fight Club is a quasi-modern masterpiece.
0896898288|5.0|I am doing a monthly paper piecing blocks of the month that is using this book.  The book is needed to see the finished block.  The blocks I am making are 4.5 inches when finished so they have some very small pieces in them.  The paper piecing is actually quite addicting!  The blocks are so cute! The book has been most useful to me in doing this project.
096798467X|4.0|We bought this book in anticipation of building one this next spring.  The book is well written and the directions look easy to follow.  We'll find out when we actually try it, but it looks easy to follow.  I particularly like the sculptural aspects of decorating the ovens and found the pictures helpful.
B00003CXBH|5.0|An eye-opening true story.  Beautiful scenery!  We should all think about what happens when we try to change the cultures of these wonderful people.

B002ZG98UA|2.0|I'm trying to be fair here in judging this film after seeing it.I've only ever seen the first one,and it just didn't really do much for me.Perhaps its because I'm not a big video game nerd?making a film based on a video game has got to be harder than making a film based on a novel or a comic book. As for the action,well...there's allot of flexibility in sci-fi and then there's WTF was that?It would probably behoove me to see the other Resident Evil films, but I don't recall them being all that memorible just as this one was. Aside from the fact that Mila Jovavich is hot,I mean...what  woman with a kick ass figure doesn't look good in a a skin tight one-piece while firing guns and  killing everything in sight?Its just that this film is a repeate of all the others,survival of the apocolypse,the evil Umbrella Corporation and killing zombies and trying not to get infected yourself.The action is tiresome,non of it is new or original,and this one reeks of ripping off \\"The Matrix\\" with its slow motion action sequences combined with \\"hanging in dead space\\" because she's suppose to be super human. All I can say is,\\"YYYYYyyyyyaaaaaawwwwwwwwn.\\"I'm rolling my eyes back in my head wondering when this stupid waste of film is going to be over, but it never seems to be.Just when you think it will be, it sets itself up for yet another pathetic sequel.My god,aren't there enough bad sequels floating around out there alredy?Apparently not.There is nothing memorible about this film.It was loaded with cheap tricks to \\"get you to jump\\",lots of guns blazing,explosions,blood and guts.It was like watching a Michael Bay knock off,it just flat out sucked and seeing it in 3d was'nt helping.The difference is, you get to see a film in 3d suck for two hours.Save yourself the time and trouble, skip this one...there are and will be other films out there that are better than this.
0767830555|5.0|I ordered this DVD and rec'd it within 72 hours - affordable prices too! If I were to order DVD's again, it would be through this vendor.
0786868694|5.0|This book has been a wonderful addition to my cook book collection.  I am embarassed to admit how many cook books I own, but I reach for anything from Nigella often!  Once you make a couple of her dishes and desserts-they you'll know why!  Her recipes are simple, extremely healthy, and with few ingredients!  We have lost weight with this new cook book, without even trying!
0307454541|1.0|A lot of reviewers mention the violent sex scenes but I did not read any revuew that mentioned what, to me, was just as sickening--the torture and killing of animals.  Not just any animal but one that had become part of the story.  Was it necessary for the story?  Maybe, but I don't have to like it.<br /><br />I believe people who torture animals and children have no business in our society.  And people who enjoy writing or reading about it are not the type of people with whom I would associate.  I know--the author is deceased and associating with him would be difficult anyway.<br /><br />I was looking forward to reading all three books of this trilogy.  Instead, the first one went in the trash and the second and third will stay unbought.  If you, like me, find torture unacceptable, do not buy this took.
B002RKSZWG|4.0|I would rank this one as the number 3 Austen book I've read, below Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility. I like the heroine because she was well-developed. She wasn't purely weak and selfless like many heroines from this genre. The love story was kind of anti-climactic, but I still liked it because it was also not typical of this genre. The heroine wasn't only about pursuing her love. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a break from the cookie-cutter story lines and character development of contemporary fiction.
B0000024RB|5.0|I really LOVE this recording!  It's got the most INCREDIBLE versions of some amazing classics!  I purchased it specifically for the cut of \\"A Summer Place\\" to be used as pre-show music in a production I was directing and producing in Hollywood, but every cut on it is truly wonderful!  I also received it in record time, allowing us to use it for the show!  Thanks, Amazon!
B002AS463W|5.0|I think this was one of Mickey Rourke's best movies. And Kim Basinger's also. These 2 really made the movie believable. I wish the ending had a happier ending but that's real life.................
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|I may not be the most well read person in town, but the Salander trilogy is the best series I've ever read.  It beats my two favorite authors over the bast 20 years, Tom Clancy and Vince Flynn.  Great characters, great story and great wrap up in the last part of the Hornet's Nest.<br /><br />Read these three books, in sequence.  You'll not be disappointed.
0061733199|3.0|While this book is feature packed, and includes a lot of nice colorful pages with wonderful pictures. I feel it's not much of a guide or handbook. I purchased it hoping maybe to get some step by step instructions on how to better survive in the wild. I think I watch too many Man vs Wild or whatever shows that really just interest me.<br /><br />However, it would show a picture of a trap with a brief explanation and then that's it. Same with knots (although some have some pretty horrid step by step instructions) and shelters, etc. I waited anxiously to receive this item to increase my knowledge, but was left thoroughly disappointed. What information it does have (and this is a heavy/thick book) is ok, so I give it three stars. If you're like me and want to learn more, and get more of a step by step then this isn't your book.
B001993Y3G|1.0|A big fan of the theatrical release. I wish both versions of the movie were on the disc. Sometimes these movies are edited well from the start and that has been the case with this movie. It wears a little long and has some pacing issues that the original did not. Some of the edited scenes drastically effect the movie and I felt in a very negative way. I have the original version on DVD and will continue to watch it rather than this one. On top of that their is very little in extras on the bluray. Just some different commentaries. So its a lose lose for me. Its a shame too. I wanted the original film only in better quality.
B002VECM6S|5.0|There should be more movies like this one in the world. A true story that just gives you hope.
B001V7P2W2|4.0|The movie is based upon a true story, which typically translates to stretching the truth for the sake of the movie storyline.  I don't know when and where the truth was stretched from the actual events, but it did not matter.  This was the first foreign film I've ever bought.  The story was riveting, and reading the subtitles was effortless most of the time.  You could not help but become completely focused on the unfolding drama.  The mountain climbing scenes literally made me nervous sometimes!  The special effects were excellent. This is DEFINITELY worth a watch.
B003V4AK8E|3.0|Personally, i feel the the 360 has a great controller for their system. Not that the PS3's is bad, but i really do enjoy the size of the 360's controller. So, when i first heard of this 360 controller for the PS3, i was pretty excited about it.    Unfortunately, it seems like i may have to keep looking.    The Pro Elite Wireless Controller for PS3 looks pretty great at first, and, in all honesty, isn't that bad. But it seems like it could have been so much better. The product ships with the controller, a USB dongle (for your wireless play), and a cord to charge it with.    Pros:  1) Great size and weight. Very similar to the Xbox's  2) Buttons have a nice glow feature that can be turned on or off by holding the select button and hitting the circle button.  3) Improved triggers (L2/R2). They're not quite a big as the 360's and they aren't as mushy as the PS3's. It's a nice hybrid.  4) The D-Pad seems to function well. Not as good as the PS3's in my opinion, but certainly much better than the 360's.    Neutral (Pro or Con?):  1) The Grip: I wasn't quite sure where to put this so I'll just mention it here. The grip has a rough, somewhat jagged surface. It seems like it will give you a great grip in long play sessions when your hands may get a bit sweaty, but it also seems like it may hurt some people's hands. I was indifferent about it.    Con:  1) HUGE dead zone in the analog sticks    Honestly, this con killed it for me. For those who may not understand what a dead zone is: It is basically the area on the analog stick where the controller won't respond. For example, if you ever so slightly nudged the analog stick on your PS3 controller, you'd notice nothing would happen. However, if you pushed it about half way to the edge, you'd noticed that the controller finally responds. That area where it doesn't respond is considered the \\"dead zone\\".    On this controller, the dead zone seems way too large. While this may not matter for all games, it can be horrible for games that require you to be a bit more precise. For example, while playing Call of Duty, it was very difficult for me to get those slight adjustments in my aim.    Overall, the controller is decent. Not terrible, but not that great either. If they ever fix the dead zone in the future, than this controller would easily be worth a 4/5 or 5/5.
B003Y6EL5W|5.0|If you are comic book fan and/or action fan this movie is a must.  It's very entertaining with plenty of comedy and action.  It also has a great plot and lots of shocking twist.  Rent it or buy KICK-ASS you will not regret it!!!!!!!!
B000069HKH|4.0|On this anniversary, I revisted \\"The Rising\\" and realized, despite its missteps and excess, the deeply felt album by Bruce Springsteen keeps alive the feelings of those inside the attacks on the World Trade Center as well as any artist could. I'll never pretend to love all of \\"The Rising,\\" but put together \\"Nothing Man,\\" \\"The Rising\\" and \\"My City in Ruins\\" back-to-back and you will find a chilling, hopeful, stirring and ultimately magestiral sequence providing a deeply felt re-entry into the horror, sadness and immediacy of one of the worst moments ever in American history. Bruce Springsteen may be a marginal, albeit loved, character in 2010 America, but when he wrote this music, he was fighting for the heart and soul of his country the only way a songwriter knows how. When the man is in touch with his necessity, his mission, he can tear through layers of fabricated discord and get to the heart of the people that make up this still great land. I'm starting to think we underestimate his gift at our own peril. At his best, he's an angel, our rock n' roll poet laureate.
B003JIPJRE|5.0|DC has done justice with Batman: Under the Red Hood.  With great plot, voice acting, and animation this movie is a MUST SEE!!!!  If you like DC, comic books, and great movies than rent or buy it.
B003TXSF5C|1.0|I bought this book with a high expectation to get a new insight from the authors' view about the beginning/born of our universe and the end of the God. However, what I got was just the old information which you can find in the previous books of Mr. Hawking and other books about Quantum Theories. Only the last chapter of the book you may find some insights about the arugument of the self functioning (without God's interfere and manipulation) nature of the universes. Besides, readers who also read the books about ancient Buddhism (e.g. Heart Sutra, What the Buddha Taught etc. ) may wonder the description of nothing, the laws of universes, the meaning of life and death, no soul theory, the non-existence of God, are in great similarities with the claims of the authors and modern quantum physics.

1567184855|5.0|I purchased 2 books \\"The Journey of Souls\\" by Micheal Newton[[ASIN:1567184855 Journey of Souls: Case Studies of Life Between Lives]]This a book you should read after the Destiny of Souls by the same author.[[ASIN:1567184995 Destiny of Souls: New Case Studies of Life Between Lives]] They are a comfort to read after losing a loved one it takes the finality out of never seeing that loved one again and slo lets you know that your loved one is always there for you.  I believe or want to believe that I will see my loved ones and we will be all together one day.  These books help you to understand what we think death is or supposed to be.  I love Amazon for these used and new books.  I bought used books that were in excellent shape.  They look like new.  They advertise what the book is like and of all the times I have ordered used books, they arrived just as described \\"almost new\\"  Thanks Amazon.com  I can order from you without any surprised.
B002VPE1AW|1.0|Avatar is a children's film. I am an adult giving a child's film one star. That may not be fair. A child may give Avatar five stars and be correct in doing so. Forget the special effects. Avatar DVD is a waste of money, for adults.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|This movie was excellent! Enlightening, both fair and critical, bracing but ultimately positive about our power, as consumers, to change the way our food is produced. It makes the point that while our food seems cheap, it imposes massive hidden costs that we, as consumers, taxpayers, and humans eventually pay for. After the first time I watched it, I ordered 20 more copies and have been giving them away to my friends and family.
B003HKN52A|5.0|Elvis on Tour is the last Elvis film to be released officially on DVD! Was it worth the wait?, well naturally if you are and Elvis fan, of course it is. The original film in 1972 was shot on 16mm film, so its never been seen as sharp as say \\"Elvis, Thats The Way It Is\\". However this is proberly the best you will ever see of Elvis On Tour! One sour note however, is that due to copy right reasons, the opening song sequence of \\"Johnnie Be Good\\", has been replaced by a loop of \\"Don't Be Cruel\\" which is dreadful!
B003F3NDOO|5.0|All, or most of the episodes are named after Tom Petty songs which is kind of bnice considering it is supposed to take place in Florida. After the relative disaster that was Dirt, Courteney Cox comes back with a winnner here. Ok, she kind of plys the Monica from Friends characer but that is ok. This is a verz funnz series that deserves to be seen.
B002BU0DPE|3.0|The quality of the headset was nice, the base was great. But when i played with friends i couldn't hear them and they couldn't hear me. I was on the xbox. It was dissapointing because the packaging says it works for the xbox also. So i would not get this if i was looking for headsets for the 360.
B0002KZAKS|5.0|This mic has surprisingly good sound for this price range! I would definitely recommend it!
0439023483|5.0|Everyone is raving about this novel, and for good reason. It's worth raving about. Kudos to this author for bringing this world to life, for better or for worse. Sometimes \\"hype\\" has a way of back-firing and tarnishing a work of substance. Very glad to see that Hunger Games is worth the praise.
0143036556|5.0|Jared Diamond delivers again after 'Guns Germs and Steel'. it is not a page-turner like Guns Germs and Steel but has very elaborate descriptions and examples of how societies form and how they collapse.<br />His projections for some states, regions in the US and the world are chilling to say the least.

B003F3NDOE|5.0|I loved this show it was funny inspiring classy and no other show had so detailed fashion. The characters are really talented actors I hope ABC does a movie I miss this because this was one of the few really good shows on tv to watch thank goodness the complete series is available for purchase. This dvd was money well spent! You won't be disapointed especially if you are a fashion fanatic like me! tear tear I really miss the show!

0316067938|4.0|This is the last book of the Twlight Saga and I was interested to see what really happened between Bella and Jacob. I knew she would marry Edward, that was a given, but I wanted to know what would happen with her relationship with Jacob. She used him in New Moon and both she and Edward used him in Eclipse. I am a rooter for the under dog and was curious what role Jacob continued to play in the saga. I am glad that he remained an integral part of Bella's life, if that's what it is called once she became a vampire. I am also glad there was finally, an explanation as to why Bella didn't succumb to the special powers of all of the vampires, excluding Jasper.  All in all, it is a good book, a great ending to the love triangle and true to Meyer's style, very wordy but entertaining. :-)
0786121009|5.0|Fast delivery and was able to enjoy with my daughter on a cross country trip. It came just as I thought.
B003H6KRIE|5.0|This is a great set of movies with a brilliant plot throughout the entire trilogy. Matt does a fine job of acting as well as all the other actors involved. The trilogy itself is packaged nicely, and Amazon ships it in a bullet proof box.<br /><br />Note: Surprisingly enough, one of my discs ended up being cracked! Probably from the manufacturer... In either case, returns with Amazon couldn't be easier. I literally gave the box that the movie came in and the movie to someone at the suggested USPS store AS Amazon was shipping me another one already. That was it. New set of discs arrived two days after I submitted my return online (the web form, no the actual box that I sent in!).
B001EN71CW|5.0|One of, if not, my favorite TV series ever. Just wish I knew it was on TV when it was first out.
0439023513|3.0|I absolutely loved the first two novels of the Hunger Games series. Mockingjay was completely depressing and sad. Through all the trials and tribulations that the nation and Katniss were subjected to, I was just waiting for some relief to be had; some semblance of happiness to finally come. But no. I feel miserable, everyone in the book seems miserable, with no way out. Katniss, although being so strong-willed throughout the first two novels, finally gives in completely in Mockingjay and is left as an empty broken hero. I should have stopped at the second novel and made up my own ending for sure.    **Edited Review-    I realize that my above view is very subjective, and an objective view on the novel would warrant it with 3 stars. Although the ending I didn't prefer, the book was still an exciting read.
B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|Let me start off by saying that I actually found the film to be rather mediocre, and not at all the kind of send-off that such an incredible series deserved. In this light, you might start to wonder why I gave it 5 Stars.    The answer? It deserves as much notice as it can possibly receive.    You see, if you're like me, you'll watch this film with no prior knowledge, be less than impressed with it, and then leave it alone for a couple years - until hearing all the unrelenting praise for Firefly, the show that spawned this movie, finally gets you to watch it. Then you become a fan, this movie remains somewhat mediocre (although with some effort you can delude yourself into thinking it's excellent), and you find yourself desperately wishing that the series would go on. Then you promptly go buy the full series and this movie, and hope against hope itself that someone will decide to pick the show up again on account of its sheer popularity (and the creator will actually deem it worth his time once more, as well as the original actors), and let the Serenity fly on.    With any luck, by my giving this 5 Stars, you'll follow my example, give it a try, and eventually find yourself adding your support to the continuation of the series. With even more luck, you'll read this review and skip straight to watching the show, and lend the movement your support much sooner.
B0001HLVS2|4.0|Master and Commander is a fine movie for fans of sea stories in general as well as fans of Patrick O' Brien's books.  The movie draws from several of the books, but remains pretty faithful to the stories.  The dialog is a little difficult to follow until you get used to it.  Now go and read the books!!

I have read some of the reviews warning that the transfer of the film is poorly done i.e color changes. I agree that Disney has always done their films in beautiful bold colors, that is one of the things that makes their films special. Howewer, don't forget the storyline and music. I'll take a chance and buy this version anyway. I can't imagine the film being horrible. Someone gave it a one star rating! WoW!!! Well,I am going to buy it. Now, I am anxiously waiting for the LION KING

B002L5GQGY|4.0|I just had a chance to watch this dvd.  It made me wish I had been to the concert live.  Joe Bonamassa will never replace SRV, but it's nice to have his music to fill in what might have been.  The visuals are great and the sound is tremendous.  He's not that great of an interview, but he does love the blues.  All this being said, if I had known that this is only a dvd and not a cd, I would have looked for the music rather than the video.  Music is for listening, not for watching.

B003HTPHSQ|4.0|I heard about this album on Bluesville XM radio.  I would never have thought of Cyndi Lauper as a blues artist.  This is a great album with some great artists on it.  \\"Romance in the Dark\\" is worth the price of the price of the album alone. If you ever want to get lucky with you significant other, that is the song to do it.

0143117130|3.0|Beginning Hilarious...Middle Boring...End Pitiful    Wanted to read this book for a long time and after watching the movie, I figured it would be a good time to read it.  The beginning was hilarious, the intimate details of Bridget's life and her wild imagination made it seem very funny at first.  But after a while, I started to lose interest.  She repeats the same patterns in her life, ends up writing drinken diary entries that make no sense, ends up with the unexpected guy but is still doing the same old thing just with a new fella.  By the middle, I wanted to be done with the book, but felt I had to finish.
0060899220|5.0|For anyone in the 80s - 90s bar/restaurant biz, this book will bring back fond memories. It's a no holds barred, tell it like it is story from our unwritten diaries & journals. To know that we all lived through it and often matured into better versions of ourselves is not only comforting, it is simply incredible. This is a fantastic read, with numerous laughs, chuckles and tears!
B00288KNJU|5.0|I was pumped with the hype on this movie and was disappointed the first time around. Then I bought this bluray 3D copy and I am emphatically pleased. 3D is perfect for this dreamy movie as it makes it so much more out there. Only complaint I have is with myself for not seeing that it comes with the 3D specs. Great movie, if you saw it before without 3D I recommend this copy.
0307454541|5.0|The \\"....Dragon Tattoo\\" kept me on the edge of my chair!  After reading this book, I had to get the next two books, \\"The Girl Who Played With Fire\\" and \\"The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest.\\" I got so caught up with the characters, that I had to follow through with them and read the trilogy! Great mystery books!
B002RAREAK|3.0|I like all the tracks on this album. I give credit to talent when it is necessary. Usher, this is one of my favorite album by you so far. the beats were good, however some of the lyrics were not to my liking. Such as the lyrics to Little Freak. Usher, you're a daddy now, so if you had little girls, ask yourself: Would I want my daughters listening to that and would I want them to be a man's little freak and going south on a man who is  treating them beyond their worth?
B0015DROBO|4.0|This books only fall back, in my opinion, was that it took too long to start up/get interesting. i am a reader who likes the book to grab my attention quickly or I will put it down and never pick it back up. The only reason I continued to read this book is because of so many peopole recommending it. All in all it was a good book and I have continued on with The Girl Who Played With Fire, and loved it, and am now reading The Girl Who Stepped On The Hornets Nest.
B00192IV0O|2.0|I had to return this CD. there were only two tracks that I liked on this album. No originality was put on the tracks, seem too redudant to me.
B0001I55SS|5.0|The first time i saw this movie was when it came out. I was 9 years old and me and my familly saw it on december 22,1979. It was part of a double disney movie day at the local theater in Corpus Chrisiti, TX. The theater was two blocks from the bay. It started off with The cat from outer space. Well seeing that one before i was being a 9 year old. Well the main feature, the black hole started at 715 pm. And for the next 98 minutes i don't think my back touched the seat or my elbows left my knee's, or my hands left my face. From the ever popular opening music score to the heaven and Hell ending i was completely taken away by the movie. From giant spaceships to flying robot's. This was at the time the largest, most costly movie Walt disney had ever made. And i still think it is the only movie with Walt Disney on it that still carries a PG rating. And for me this was what i called an open movie. Unlike \\"Star Wars\\" that had everyone running around corners the whole movie, unless they were in a desert. The Cygnus had long open hallways and huge rooms and sets. The Part were they come out of the elevator on the bridge, and the camera pulls back as the crew of the Palomino walks out. Truly an impressive set.     Ok Looking at it threw a 39 year old's eyes. The visual impact was still there, it still had me going about how they could do something like this in 1979 but not in 2010.This whole movie had around i think 3 minutes of computer generated graphics, as a warm up for Tron that came out next year i have read. everything was model and live action. The cast was there,  Maximilian Schell, Robert Forster, Joseph Bottoms, Yvette Mimieux, Anthony Perkins, Ernest Borgnine, and the robots voiced by Roddy McDowall and Slim Pickens, and for what ever reason there names appeared no were on the credits. One thing is for sure, you can not mistake Slim Pickens voice! The big hang up sadly was the plot. It was a as cheesy as cheesy can be. This i was suprised in. Guess i did not remember it like that the first time around or when it was shown on HBO years later. Another thing i am still impressed with in this movie is the fact that it was what is now called the old studio way of doing a movie. Nothing, not one single set, or anything about this movie was done out side of the walt disney studio. There are rumors flying around that they wanted Lucas's new Industrial Light and Magic (ILM) to do the special effect's. But ILM was booged down with the second star wars movie the empire strikes back. And the other rumor states that Lucas wanted to much money. I think these are just that, Rumor's.      The film is directed by Gary Nelson. Who had done a lot of the Disney live action movies we all know and love. He also played the part of the unhooded robot. Producer Peter Ellenshaw had his way when it came to Walt Disney movies. He had been with them for a long time and had a proven track record. In a book on him that is long out of print, it was released in mid 1980, there was a long chapter about the black hole. He said more than once that the studio had what he needed to make the movie in house. He said the only thing they never planned right was the budget, it went far beyond anyone's wildest dream's to recreate everything that they once had to make the movie, and the people they had to pull out of retirment that knew what was needed to be done, Peter Ellenshaw was one who got pulled out of retirement for the film. The Budget for this one movie was 26 Million dollars. 6 million of that was for advertising the movie. So 20 million on a movie was a big jump in 1978 when it was being made. Star wars had a 3 million dollar budget. ANd i think the Black Hole earned over 50 million in it's release. Probaly a lot more since being on TV, VHS and DVD. Wish Disney would do a blu ray version and fix some flaws of the original, Lucas did it was his re release of the star wars movies on DVD. And that went over with fans pretty good.     I Still give it 5 stars for the \\"WOW\\" factor. And i give the \\"Overture\\" opening music composed by John Berry 5 stars as well.
B002QGUFWE|5.0|Lady Gaga is so talented and very articulate. This album was the bomb!!!! Continue  producing albums like this and I will definetly support your work.  There wasn't one track that i didn't like and to think I almost didn't purchase the album thinking it would be whack!
B001TH8UUA|5.0|A few months back I purchased a media bridge HDMI cable from amazon to use between the HDMI out on my digital cable box and the HDMI input on my TV. After 12-24 hours the signal would be lost and the only way to get it back was to reboot the cable box. I screwed around for over 2 weeks trying to figure out what possibly could be causing this. I did some digging and apparently there is some issues between some cable boxes and some televisions. I even tried two other media bridge cables (that seemed to work fine the other places I was using them) and also another brand cable and had the same result. So after a couple weeks of constantly rebooting the cable box and television, I resigned myself to just using component cables (which seemed to fix the problem, it's been months in that configuration without any issues) which sucks because now I had 5 cables where before I only had one. Also, it double sucks if you have a wall mounted TV. Anyways, the other day I decided to try and use a different brand of cable and see if it made any difference and this amazon cable got pretty good reviews and is very cheap in price. Well, it's been over 4 days and the signal hasn't dropped out between the TV and cable box so I hope this has solved the problem! I'm pretty sure I can edit reviews so if the signal does quit I will be sure to come back here and update this. Otherwise if nothing has changed you can assume the cable worked out for me! I hope this helps somebody else!
0393068382|1.0|Fine's choice of references, and her way of analyzing them, along with the entire structure of the book, seem problematic.  As just a first check I took a careful look at the reference for her statement \\"[T]he use of the digit ratio as a marker of prenatal testosterone exposure is controversial and lacks clear empirical support.  For review see (McIntyre, 2006).\\"  When I actually looked at McIntyre's review, his concluding comments were very different from what Fine implied he said.  McIntyre wrote \\"The validity of digit ratios as markers for perinatal androgen action is supported by a number of lines of recently reported evidence, but further support is needed.\\"<br /><br />Now this is just one data point--the only one I've checked so far.  But based on this, I suspect Fine may not be an honest broker of the material. *<br /><br />More importantly, I am wondering why no mention was made in this book of David Reimer: the boy who was raised as a girl. Here is a little bit about that episode, from \\"[...]l\\" (Begin quote)<br /><br />\\"Teachers anxiously asked the parents for more information about what made \\"Brenda\\" so strange, so combative, so un-ladylike. One of \\"Brenda's\\" few friends at school later recalled:<br /><br />As far as I knew, Brenda was a girl -- physically. But from everything that she did and said, she indicated that she didn't want to be a girl. The other girls in our group were competitive against the boys; we wanted to prove we could do whatever they could do. We might get in arguments with the guys, but we wouldn't have gone as far as to fight with them physically. I wouldn't want a bruise on my face, for example. But Brenda fought with the boys. Brenda would take the bruises. I myself was a tomboy, but I never wanted to be a boy. Brenda did.<br /><br />Injections of female hormones did nothing to change \\"Brenda's\\" boyish ways. \\"When I say there was nothing feminine about Brenda,\\" brother Brian Reimer later recalled, \\"I mean there was nothing feminine:<br /><br />She walked like a guy. Sat with her legs apart. She talked about guy things, didn't give a crap about cleaning house, getting married, wearing makeup. We both wanted to play with guys, build forts and have snowball fights and play army. She'd get a skipping rope for a gift, and the only thing we'd use that for was to tie people up, whip people with it. She played with my toys: Tinkertoys, dump trucks. This toy sewing machine she got just sat.<br /><br />Remember, neither \\"Brenda,\\" nor her brother, nor any of her classmates knew the true story about her sexual identity. They all thought she was a girl, albeit a girl who behaved pretty strangely. The other kids at school called her \\"gorilla,\\" or \\"Cavewoman.\\" One girl who made fun of Brenda must have been surprised when Brenda \\"grabbed her by the front of her shirt, smashed her against the lockers, and threw her onto the ground. Boys who teased her got similar treatment. \\"That's what always impressed me about Brenda,\\" said a classmate. \\"She'd actually fight with the boys who teased her. She'd haul off and punch them. I always wished I could do that.\\"<br /><br />...<br /><br />Reflecting on the case, Dr. Milton Diamond commented that \\"if all these combined medical, surgical, and social efforts could not succeed in making that child accept a female gender identity, then maybe we really have to think that there is something important in the individual's biological makeup; that we don't come to this world neutral; that we come to this world with some degree of maleness and femaleness which will transcend whatever the society wants to put into it.\\"<br />(End quote)<br /><br />Also, Fine dismisses Baron-Cohen's E-S theory based on his popular books, with little discussion of the solid scientific evidence that underpins his work. For more along those lines, in regards, for example, the profound sex differences in disorders such as depression, anxiety, and anorexia, see See Zahn-Waxler, C, NR Crick. \\"The origins and development of psychopathology in females and males.\\" Development and Psychopathology 1 (2006): 76. wherein it is noted:<br />\\"Beginning in adolescence, females are two to three times more likely than males to experience unipolar depressive disorders, as seen both community-based and clinically-referred samples (Kessler, McGonagle, Swartz, Blazer, & Nelson, 1993; Nolen-Hoeksema, 1990; Weissman & Klerman, 1977; Weissman, Leaf, Bruce, & Florio, 1988). It is also present whether depression is diagnosed as a disorder or measured along a continuum of symptom severity.<br />...<br />After puberty, the lifetime prevalence in females is twice that of males (Lewinsohn, et al., 1993). Comorbidity of depressive and anxiety disorders is much more common in girls than boys (Lewinsohn, et al., 1995b); moreover depression that is comorbid with more than one anxiety disorder is virtually exclusive to females (Lewinsohn, Zinbarg, Seeley, Lewinsohn, & Sack, 1997). Female gender and presence of a coexisting anxiety disorder are also related to severity of initial depression (McCauley, et al., 1993). Co-occurrence of symptoms is even higher when subclinical levels also are considered. Although depression and anxiety can be clearly differentiated at biological, cognitive, behavioral, and affective levels, the extent to which they overlap and cooccur suggests that the combination represents a unique but common form of depression, particularly in females.<br />Females show a different constellation of depressive symptoms than males, notably more anxiety, more somatic symptoms, hypersomnia, weight gain, increased appetite, fatigue, psychomotor retardation, and body image disturbance (see review by Zahn-Waxler, et al., in press). Increased appetite and weight gain seem to be the most distinct symptoms in women and adolescent girls. Higher rates of crying, sadness, and negative self-concept have been noted for school-age and adolescent girls.<br />In research by Gjerde and Block (1995), dysphoric males often expressed their unhappiness directly and without hesitation, by acting on the world in an aggressive, hostile manner. Dysphoric symptoms in female adolescents, in contrast, were characterized by introspection, absence of open hostility, and a mostly hidden preoccupation with self. As early as age 7, boys who later showed dysthymia were aggressive, self-aggrandizing, and undercontrolled, whereas dysthymic girls were intropunitive, oversocialized, overcontrolled, anxious and introspective (Block, Gjerde, & Block, 1991). Young girls who later became depressed also had close relationships. The sadness and anxiety in depressed girls and hostility in depressed boys can be seen as exaggerations of normative sex differences. These studies focus on subclinical depression. Further studies of males and females with clinical depression are needed to determine whether their symptomatology shows a similar pattern. Other research suggests that young, depressed boys show a pattern of acting out (Kovacs, 1996). In a recent observational study of young children, boys, but not girls, with both subclinical and clinical depression were likely to show anger relative to controls (Luby, et al., 2005).<br />Genetic/Biological Explanations. Some studies report similar heritability estimates for depressive disorders in males and females, several others find differences (e.g. Bierut, et al., 1999; Jacobson & Rowe, 1999; Kendler, Gardner, Neale, & Prescott, 2001a; Tambs, Harris, & Magnus, 1995). Kendler, et al. (2001) suggest that in genetic linkage studies, the impact of some loci on risk for major depression will vary in men and women. Genetics are also involved in the etiology of depression through their effect on sensitivity to environmental events. Silberg Rutter, Neale, & Eaves (2001) found that genetics had a larger effect on the development of depression in adolescent girls who had experienced a negative event in the previous year than on those who did not. Kendlerand colleagues (Kendler, 1998; Kendler, et al., 1995) found that persons at greater genetic risk were twice as likely to develop major depression in response to severe stress than those at lower genetic risk. Genetic risk also altered sensitivity to the environment for women only (Kendler, et al., 1995a). At puberty, girls' negative life events and stability of depression over time are more genetically mediated than for boys (Silberg, et al., 1999).\\"<br /><br />See also Zahn-Waxler, C, EA Shirtcliff. \\"Disorders of childhood and adolescence: Gender and psychopathology.\\" Annual Review of Clinical Psychology 4 (2008): 275-303. This paper, as Zahn-Waxler points out, \\"is about the origins of sex differences in different forms of psychopathology in males and females. Internalizing problems (anxiety and depression) are much more common in females than males and externalizing problems (Conduct problems, ADHD, etc.) are much more common in males than females. These differences hold across cultures, though the relative differences may vary.\\" (Email communication with the author, Aug 27, 2010.)<br />Also observe Zahn-Waxler, C, E Race. \\"Mood disorders and symptoms in girls.\\" Handbook of Behavioral and Emotional Problems in Girls (2005): 25-77. which notes:<br />\\"The rates of depression in childhood are comparable for boys and girls (with boys showing slightly higher rates), but while the rates dramatically increase around puberty for girls, they remain the same for boys or increase to a lesser extent (Anderson, Williams, McGee, and Silva, 1987; Angold and Rutter, 1992). Studies based both on diagnostic interviews and standardized self-reports indicate that this change in prevalence rates begins around ages 13-15 (Angold, Costello, and Worthman, 1998; Ge, Lorenz, Conger, Elder, et al., 1994; Petersen, Sargiani, Kennedy, 1991; Wichstrom, 1999). There is a 4-23% increase in diagnosed depression in adolescents between the ages of 15 to 18 (Hankin, Abramson, Moffitt, Silva, & McGee (1998). After puberty, the lifetime prevalence of depression in females is two times that of adolescent males, and one-year first incidence of depression is 1.6% greater for females than males (Lewinsohn, et al., 1993). Sex differences in depression are found consistently across cultures within the United States and the world, controlling for income, education, and occupation (McGrath, Keita, Strickland, & Russo, 1990; Weissman, Bland, Canino, Faravelli, et al., 1996).\\"<br /><br />See also Altemus, M, and L Epstein. \\"Sex differences in anxiety disorders.\\" In Sex Differences in the Brain: From Genes to Behavior, edited by Jill B.

B002VECLVO|5.0|This movie was so beautiful in its flow and appeal to the senses. It was about a man who had lost his male love to a horrible car accident. The movie reflected subtly on this man's personality and his way of dealing with grief. It layered his character with the loss so well. The way he saw life thru flashbacks so you had an idea of who he was, not all of him, but his nuances. It is hard for me to describe him here because I saw the movie in the past and it is difficult to express. He seemed like he was living one moment at a time after his partner passed away. He was a thoughtful and organized person, yet he wanted to explore sentiment, but seemed restricted. This came out even in his happiness with his other. After the funeral he seems to be dissassociated from life, almost as if observing. He seemed to even be observing his own grief, logically dissecting what was happening without the emotion. He is a college professor and dallys with the thought of having a fling with a male student, who is intelligent and polite. He goes to have an intimate dinner party with an older glamourpuss who wants nothing more than to be his everything, yet all these things are meaningless more or less to him. He thinks of his love and of ending the controlled structure of life. He ponders fear and change with his students, yet remains quite centered and uninvolved with his surroundings. This film was very intense. The things I liked in it were the artistic setting, Julianne's makeup, hairstyle, her decor in the house, the colors that the film was softened in and the way the dining room looked out onto the ink blackness with creamy flowerbuds gentle and safe. I liked the intimacy she shared with Firth's character, her love of talking. I liked the way they danced and let go in each others company. I loved the architecture of his home and the isolated peace. The maid who helped him fix up his house and maintain his meals for him. The film just flowed like prose with languid beauty, although it was not a cheerful film, it was of art.
1400052173|5.0|This book melds the two very different stories of the family of Henrietta Lacks, a poor African American woman, who died tragically at Johns Hopkins Hospital of an aggressive cervical cancer in 1951 and the story of her cancer cells (called HeLa cells) that were harvested from her tumor and used by medical researchers throughout the world for the next 50 years without the knowledge or permission of her family.<br /><br />The author has done an extensive research job in putting together this book. The afterword notes that it took 10 years to complete the book. She did a great job. The science is easily understood by the average reader, the family story is enhanced by the author's patient relationship with the family of Henrietta. The science side of the story is a history of medical/laboratory research in the 20th century told with the HeLa cells as the central player. The life of Henrietta and her family is a history of rural African Americans who migrate to the big city - Baltimore and all the problems that were part of that story. The author intertwines these stories in a masterful way.<br /><br />Let me start with the science and medicine. I loved this part of the story. As a med tech that started working in the 1960s my career began at the end of this era. In the 1960s, the MDs were still gods almost never questioned by anyone, patient informed consent was totally unknown, reagent companies were in their infancy, lab techniques were far from standardized, medical conferences were often peppered with public fights between different research camps, mailing blood samples around the world in card board boxes was standard practice and there were remnants of racism in medical care. The reader is treated to detailed reviews of these topics and lots of others always tying the topic back to the HeLa cell cultures. I was further entertained in the story when it turned out I actually knew some of the medical folks from Fox Chase Cancer Institute and Johns Hopkins who played a part in this story (I actually almost drive off the road as I listened to the Hopkins section!). Learning of some of the dubious ethical studies that occurred in the 1950s, `60s and `70s gave me knew respect for the development of informed consent policies and the role of Institutional Review Boards in protecting patient rights.<br /><br />The story of Henrietta Lacks and her family is gripping. While the HeLa cells were in wide use in laboratories throughout the world her family had no idea until 1975 that their mother's cells had been harvested and continued to exist. Following their identification as the family of the HeLa cell donor they are harassed and besieged by reporters and other charlatans. The author in a skilled way shows the two very different versions of the same events told by the mostly white medical establishment and the poor black Lacks family. Henrietta had five children, only one of whom was old enough to have memories of her. The children were each haunted by the existence of these cells and the effects on them were different. Her daughter, Deborah is a central character in the story. Never really knowing her mother she searches for some aspect of her mother's life in the cell culture story. Hampered by the lack of an education she slowly, with the author's help, comes to know the impact that her mother's cells have had in medicine. I was really moved by the growth that Deborah shows over the course of investigating these events. I was also moved by her lack of anger against the medical field and institutions that had treated her family with such wanton disregard. In the end for me, she was the most memorable character assuming a kind of goodness and dignity denied to her mother.<br /><br />Lastly what I liked about this book is the way the author presented the story in a non judgmental way. Both the family and especially the medical establishment committed acts that did no one proud. She is not condescending nor patronizing to the Lacks family; she does not condemn the medical establishment. It would have been easy to sensationalize this story but she didn't, she just calmly and in a very fair and straightforward way reported it.<br /><br />This book tells a poignant human story surrounded by compelling medical science. Folks with no science background could and should read this book but it should be required reading for medical professionals. It is hard to believe that this was a debut book for Rebecca Skloot, here's hoping for many more!e medical establishment.

030745455X|5.0|This book starts out a little slowly and you wonder \\"why is the author sticking this in?\\".  Before long, the plot takes off like a rocket!  The characters are so incredible and richly described.  If you enjoy suspense, intrigue and human emotions..this whole series will be just right.
B003JJA59K|3.0|SPOILERS: It's a good thing they got Vigo for his role. He does much to carry the film. Don't look for a powerful performance, though. The film is very minimalist, but not cheap looking. Too light on the background info. What's w/the thumbs??? The central theme of retaining humanity amidst the threats is maybe too subtle (biblical, blinding Eli is about as clear as they made it). I've never read the book. I think perhaps that a book is more ideal for this type of story. After watching the film two times? I'm not left feeling entertained, emotionally affected, or intellectually stimulated. Something is missing from this project. Like I said. i think this theme would be far better served up in book form. As an aside. I again wish the Libertard backers of these films would consult w/KNOWLEDGEABLE weapons experts. Handgun, flare pistol, & compound bows in this case. The more realistic you make it? The more believable, & entertaining it will be. Greater entertainment = more money, no? So, what gives?     P.S.: Oh Yeah, I almost forgot. Props for using an Uncle Teddy lookalike @the end :-). Why didn't they ask the real Ted Nugent?!

I refused and asked them to resend<br />the books at their cost. They agreed, but never sent the books. A week later they<br />claimed they were out of stock on everything I ordered and issued me a credit. This whole ordeal dragged out a month. I ended up going back to Barnes & Noble and bought the books the next day. The books were good but I'm done with Amazon.

Some interesting remixes/songs toward the end of the CD! Em may be sober now, but that doesnt mean hes better/worse, just different. As with almost all of his albums, this ones relatively sad or at least depressingly regretful or reminiscent.

0765326353|5.0|Thank you Mr. Sanderson for writing such a wonderful book, and to TOR for publishing it.    The author wrote a masterpiece.  Anyone who is a fan of military/fantasy fiction will be amazed at the amount of thought that went into this novel.     The setting is amazing, filled with a unique mythology that spans eons, and is cleverly revealed in just the right amount throughout the tale.  The characters are complex, engaging and I am simply in awe of the authors attention to detail regarding their development.  During the climax, I literally shut the family out of the bedroom.    This is the kind of series that comes along once in a generation.

0767802519|4.0|A little late in the history of the film to be adding to the array of reviews but nonetheless, a brief reflection upon it.  With the exception of Gary Oldham, forced to play a Richard Widmark, Tommy Udo, type, the cast does a fine job. Oldham has an impact but it is out of synch with the underplaying demanded of most of the adult players. A young Natalie Portman stands out as a young girl orphaned by the killings of the Bad Guys.  The Director tries to make the best of both worlds, naturalism and explosive action, and succeeds in making a gripping film, but fails in maintaining the flavor of what might have been a harmonious structure consonant with similar films, such as Gregory Peck's, The Gunfighter, or Gary Cooper's, High Noon. In The Professionals, the descent into mindless savagery, made for good then-current box office quality, but not for aesthetic unity.  So, for those for whom senseless violence inter-mixed with sensitive scenes among essentially vicious people (and a girl on her way into that category) this will be an eminently entertaining, even engrossing, two hours. Others might do well to approach with caution, that is, watch on a night where voyeuristic violence is what one needs to give vent to those internal pressures which need harmless outlet.
B002VPE1AW|4.0|An iteresting mixture of live action footage and computer generated graphics, the story line comes up a bit short because it asks us to \\"suspend our disbelief\\" a bit too much.  For example,we are never told about evolution of the technology that turn humans into the indigenous life forms.  The CGI was impressive but I would like to have seen how the scenes were created.  Perhaps there will be a DVD with extra footage and behind-the-scenes images explaining how the movie was made.  Entertaining, but four stars.
0553805371|4.0|This book has gotten plenty of news coverage due to its theological discussions, so let's just get this out of the way: Hawking does not claim that God does not exist. Rather, he and his co-author claim that it is not necessary to invoke a God to explain the existence of our universe. Of course this is not a new or particularly controversial idea in modern physics, and Hawking has already made similar claims over 20 years ago in A Brief History of Time.  So, those reviewers who are so hung up on this issue should simply take a few deep breaths and realize that science has long since moved past the traditional ideas of creation.    Now, the book itself is very short and easy to read. At under 200 pages and with some beautifully designed graphics, reading this book probably wont be an exhaustive task. On the other hand, I'm sure many of the concepts will sound a bit crazy to those not familiar with the craziness of quantum mechanics. Nevertheless, Hawking and Mledinow do a great job at explaining why there are very good reasons to think that the implications of quantum mechanics are true - namely, that they've been experimentally verified.    As far as pop-physics books go, you could do better (the length of the book doesn't allow the authors to go into much detail). But you could also do a hell of a lot worse; A Brief History of Time, even though it's one of the most popular physics books of all time, is much more tedious and boring. The Grand Design, on the other hand, certainly has the best explanations of Hawking's ideas that I've read.    To summarize, a person buying this book because of the media hype will almost certainly be disappointed. Hawking doesn't attempt to disprove God or anything like that, but he does give a pretty good account for how we can understand the universe without appealing to a creator. But if you're mildly interested in the subject of theoretical physics, this book is perfect.

I like the writing style, I love the story, but I must admit I didn't like the ending. That said, it's a well written, exciting book and I thoroughly enjoyed the story so I will rate it based on that rather than what I think should have happened.
B003V4AK8E|5.0|I play shooting games all the time on my Xbox 360 and find the PS3 controller to be lacking in playing any standard games that requires the analog stick to navigate. I decided to try this controller out for my PS3. Feels great in your hands, if you've held an Xbox 360 controller before this is pretty much a carbon copy in terms of form factor, ie: how it feels when you hold it. The *only* difference is a slight height difference with the analog sticks, they stand a little higher than the Xbox ones, and it is lighter than your average Xbox 360 controller. The trigger buttons feel alright as well. This is as close as you'll get to an Xbox controller for a PS3, at least for now.

B000002KJK|4.0|Quite the departure from his previous album [[ASIN:B000002KHA Foot Loose & Fancy Free]] this album showcases songs that don't exactly keep moving within themselves. Not to say this album doesn't showcase Rod's versatility but both in terms in sound of songwriting and such but there's something that just seems missing. Much of it could be something of a lack of performance vigor in the force of Rod's voice itself. Obviously the two main points of contention on this album are the lead off track \\"Do Ya Think I'm Sexy\\" and a version of \\"Standing In The Shadows Of Love\\". These are the only songs here that actually showcase the disco beat and bassline that tends to make people think of these albums. I've even heard this referred to as Rod's \\"disco album\\" as well as being a \\"trashy album with a lot of bad double entandres\\". Well on the later that is something of the case but on the former I would have to say no. By no means is this a full on disco album and,interestingly enough that's what keeps it from being as expansive as the standard Rod Stewart fare. This album features a lot of rockers such as \\"Dirty Weekend\\",\\"Ain't Love A Bitch\\",\\"Attractive Female Wanted\\" and the title song but frankly these are actually somewhat weaker imitations of what Stewart had already done before in this direction and don't offer anything particularly new in that effect. It wasn't exactly surprising since Stewart had found himself stuck in something of a rut in much the same way years earlier on [[ASIN:B00000612S Smiler]],his final Mercury release. Same can be said on \\"The Best Days Of My Life\\" and \\"Is This The Thanks I Get?\\",two ballads that,with their folksy guitar sound and melody line again are repetitious of what came before,without really offering particularly strong songcraft. On the other hand two of the songs that offer something ear catching ARE the two uptempo disco/rock numbers. They may not have been what Rod Stewart fans wanted to hear at that time,or even now but they did serve to keep things fresh even despite disco's detractors. Another excellent tune here is the lightly Caribbean tinged,light pop/jazz styled groove of \\"Last Summer\\",with a breezy tale of beach side love and loss that's a refreshing change of pace from the usual gluttonous sexual themes of most of the rest of the tunes here. The album does end on a compelling musical not with \\"Scarred and Scared\\" which has the kind of great moody rhythmic and melodic changes that closer defined where Stewart was going musically beforehand. This is not his worst album by any means but does show the perhaps Stewarts \\"new sound\\" that began to take shape on [[ASIN:B000PGXEEI Atlantic Crossing]] four years earlier and served him well over the succeeding two albums after was in itself beginning to go a bit South and that Rod Stewart was,for the second time in his solo career in the need for another change up.ut they did serve to keep things fresh even despite disco's detractors.

B001RTSPVY|4.0|This show is the best on the market. Great characters,storyline,acting and plot-twists make it well worth watching.

B0026ZNL7Q|5.0|If someone were to ask me \\"What is progressive rock/metal?\\" I would, without a doubt hand them a copy of Riverside's Anno Domini High Definition. There is not a single misstep on this record (after all, there are only 5 [REALLY AWESOME] songs here). The musicianship and compositions that Mariusz Duda and Co. wield are only rivaled by fellow prog-metal giants Porcupine Tree and Tool. I was never too excited about Riverside's first 3 records, but ADHD is on a whole other level than any of Riverside's previous albums. I hope this album is held in as high regard as Tool's [[ASIN:B00005B36H Lateralus]] and Porcupine Tree's [[ASIN:B000O75F7C Fear of a Blank Planet]] in the future as a classic example of prog rock and metal.
B002RSDW80|3.0|I don't normally enjoy \\"chick flicks\\" but was able to sit through this one and even enjoy the \\"Julia\\" half of it.  Meryl Streep is an incredible actress and made \\"Julia\\" come to life.  The actress portraying \\"Julie\\" did a fine job of portraying her, but the character is just too whiny and self-centered to enjoy.  The whole premise of \\"finding one's self\\" by cooking her way through a cookbook is absurd and hard to watch.  I don't doubt that Julia was disgusted by Julie's blogging this into a \\"life changing\\" escapade.<br /><br />Both husbands in the movie tend to be long suffering and put up with a lot of whining and indecision from their wives.  Julia's husband was wealthy and could afford to indulge his wife's expensive tastes but Julie's husband cannot.  Julia had the time, money and forceful personality to indulge her fantasies and turn them into reality, but Julie wallows in her lack of disadvantages.  Somehow modern sensibilities transform Julie's mediocrity into fame.<br /><br />All in all, this is a watchable movie thanks to Meryl and Amy and Julia but difficult in many scenes involving Julie.  Not a great film but not terrible, either.
0061251305|4.0|I did learn something valuable from reading this book about how tribes within an organization socialize members using different vocabularies that reflect the levels of their abilities to work effectively as teams. Stage 1 tribes are alienated and employ a language that reflects \\"everything sucks.\\" Stage 2 tribes see a glimmer of hope, feeling that only \\"my life sucks,\\" but they see that from a different point of view matters might look better. Stage 3 tribes are individualistic, with each member achieving on his or her own, employing an \\"I'm great\\" rhetoric. At stage 4, members have shifted to a \\"we're great\\" rhetoric, while the most effective units move sporadically onto stage 5, where truly transformative change can take place; at this level \\"life is great,\\" because the business model of the highly functioning organization is vibrating in sync with larger social and scientific trends in the society at large.    While the authors take care not to note that organizations can be working at multiple stages at one time and that individuals may move in and out of different stages, they still have a tendency to treat these different levels as if they had a fixed and empirical reality, rather than being short-cuts for describing a broader constellation of behaviors. Also, they oversell their method and thus overwrite the book a bit. I read it through from page one to the end, and I was pretty bored by the last sections. I guess that's not the best way to read such a book. I also must confess that I have not read a lot of management consulting books, and according to the reviews this one is more compelling and well written than most. That's probably true, though it doesn't make me want to read more; I don't have a basis for comparison. Yet I did find it repetitive.

1574241451|4.0|To have an entire book written about a specific type of guitar, that guitar type must be really something, and the Gibson ES-335 has proven worthy over the many years since its introduction.  The author covers various aspects of the ES-335 from its origin, construction, parts, versions, copies, and players.  Since I bought a new Gibson ES-335 back in 1980, I can understand what makes this instrument so appealing to so many musicians.  It is a guitar that can produce great sounds in a variety of styles.  As a blues/R&B/soul music fan, I wanted a sound that I heard on many a record at the time.  As I checked out my kind of music, I found many players who were playing and recording with the ES-type of guitar.  Most played Gibson ES-style guitars, but several played other brands that followed the Gibson prototype, such as:  Epiphone (owned by Gibson), Guild, Gretsch, etc.  The book mentions these other brands, including Heritage which was started by former Gibson employees in 1985 and which is still made in the original Gibson factory in Kalamazoo, MI.  And yes, they are still making ES-335-style guitars with their H535 and H555 models two examples.  Guitarists that play ES-type guitars who have inspired me over the years include:  B.B. King, Jimmy Dawkins, Magic Sam, Freddie King, Eddie Clearwater, Little Milton, Lowell Fulson, Otis Rush, Jimmy Johnson, W.C. Clark, Luther Allison, Maurice John Vaughn, Walter \\"Wolfman\\" Washington, Rusty Zinn, Jim McCarty, and Del Shannon.  The book includes many photos of ES-335 and other versions, along with the pros that play or played them.  My only negative on the book is the author's inclusion of a few guitarists that were not true long-term ES-335 players, but only played the instrument for a relative short time.
B003HTPHSQ|5.0|Great CD
0316098337|4.0|Many other reviewers noted that they couldn't put this book down and had to read it straight through. I had a somewhat different experience; I felt extremely unsettled, somewhere between feeling nauseated due to a deep pain in my gut and nervousness like before a panic attack.    As pathetic as it sounds, I often read the end of a book before I'm even halfway done. I've always been like that, I just can't stand knowing that I am holding information that I am not using, so I did read the end of this book before I was 1/3 through, and that helped me continue on. I honestly don't think I would have finished reading it if I did't peek ahead.    The author's story is told from a unique perspective, that of a 5 year old boy. As other reviewers mentioned, there are some points that seem hard to believe that a 5 year old could be so observant or sophisticated in his explanations of such observations. But, that's only a minor issue, and is really just necessary to tell the story.     Other reviewers went into many of the same details of the room, of the power of a mother's love, so I won't repeat it all here. It's hard to read Room and not experience a wide range of emotions, but it was a bit gut wrenching to read from a 5 year old's perspective, and at times tiresome (the later sections of the book were easier, but that's where it seemed a bit unrealistic that a 5 yr old would be able to communicate with such accurate detail. Then again, after spending 5 yrs with only his mother, it is also quite possible.)
B000NA28A2|5.0|Excellent condition, just as described. This CD has variety of music, not only merenges. Juan Luis Guerra has done it again: another success!
B002P4VUMQ|4.0|Jason Mraz is one of the very few artists that I've purchased a live album from because I know that he is going to give an incredibly energetic performance with additions and flairs in the music that aren't on the CD (Tonight, Not Again is a great treat too).  And while he delivers, the CD cuts it in order to make more songs fit.  The problem with this is that you get a live version of We Sing, We Dance, We Steal Things with 2 unreleased songs and The Remedy without showing off the brass section or the creativity that makes his shows amazing.  Simply put, watch the DVD; it's even mixed better.
0439023513|5.0|FIVE STARS! Read it!     This book is a runaway train. The action is intense. The pacing is amazing. At times I wished the author would have paused for a moment so my brain could catch up, but Collins charged forward with Katniss, the hero, and I raced along to catch up.     This book is brilliant. I was moved repeatedly. I laughed a bit. I teared up at the end. I loved it. And I'll read all three books again.     I've read several reviews by other people complaining about specific aspects of the book. I cannot disagree more. Here's why.     This book isn't about a fantasy romance like another trilogy. It's not about which boy will she pick. It's a condemnation of war, an exploration of the choices war forces on individuals and groups, and the effects of war on people's lives, especially the innocent.     I'm sorry if you were expecting something different. Maybe you should check out the Twilight trilogy instead.     You might not like the choices Collins made in her story, but I think she wanted to tell a specific story and did a great job telling it.     ==== SPOLIER ALERT ====   ==== I AM GOING TO RUIN THE BOOK IF YOU HAVEN'T READ IT SO STOP HERE ====     Unlike in the arena in other books where Katniss is one combatant out of 24, in this book Katniss is just one girl a war that involves all of humanity. She has no real power to effect events in any real way until the war is over. We want her to be a queen, fearless and powerful, but she is just a pawn caught up in a war between two sides. I found this personally very painful to see my hero brought to this low and desperate place. Katniss wants to be powerful, she wants to make a difference, and she's rather delusional, I believe, to think she can assassinate President Snow and end the war. Maybe she could have done it, but I doubt it was ever Collins's intention for Katniss to end the war directly.     If you think that Katniss isn't as damaged as Peeta and all of the other victors of the games in this book, youare woefully wrong. Each victor in this book is haunted by and struggles with serious demons. Katniss mourns the people she kills, directly and indirectly. She goes so far as to keep a mental list them. They haunt her dreams repeatedly. In the first book, The Captial forces her to kill in the arena. President Coin's new regime forces / asks her to kill again after the war ends. Coin's solution to ending the war was more Hunger Games. President Coin is the flip-side of President Snow. Katniss had to kill Coin to end the Hunger Games forever.     Collins doesn't describe the soldiers in Katniss's 451 unit in great detail: Leeg 1 and Leeg 2 are sisters and soldiers with first names we never learn. I think this is intentional, not laziness, and an accurate depiction of soldiers. There are Tombs of Unknown Soldiers in countries around the world because countless soldiers fight and die and we don't know enough information about them to put names on a grave. That's reality, not lazy fiction.     When I read the book, I didn't know if Katniss would end up with Gale or Peeta. I asked myself several times who I thought it would be and I could never decide. But having finished the book, the ending was logical. Peeta has a much stronger bond with her. He understands Katniss and her history in a way Gale never will. Furthermore, it's foreshadowed repeatedly towards the end of the last book. At the end of Chapter 22, when Katniss, Peeta, Gale, and the rest of 451 are crawling out of the sewers, Peeta is losing his mind again at this point. Katniss tries to calm Peeta down. In a moment of desperation, she kisses him. Katniss says, \\"Stay with me.\\" Peeta snaps back to reality and replies, \\"Always.\\" (CHILLS!) Later, when all the victors vote about future Hunger Games, Peeta has burn marks from the same explosion that burned Katniss. He stayed with her always.     I don't believe Katniss can ever forgive Gale when he doesn't deny being responsible for killing Prim. \\"I don't know\\" isnot the same as \\"I didn't do it.\\" I think he feels guilty and she half-blames him.     Prim's death was heart-breaking for me, not because I cared deeply for Prim, but because Katniss did. Katniss fought and suffered through three books to save Prim's life. By acting to avoid Prim's death, Katniss inadvertently created the circumstances of Prim's death. The war may have never happened if another girl's name had been chosen from District 12. If it did, Katniss and Prim certainly would have had a different place in it. I hated seeing all of Katniss's blood, sweat, and tears accomplishing nothing in the end.     To me, Katniss returning to District 12 to live out her days wasn't some \\"And then they lived happily ever after...\\" tacked-on ending. I guess Collins could have stopped the story here, but she doesn't. Despite everything that happens, Katniss learns, in time, how to love again: first she loves Peeta, then she loves their children. This moral has been repeated in stories and songs for ages, and it's no less true here.     FIVE STARS!

B004132I20|5.0|this show is a pitch perfect modernization of Sherlock and doctor Watson 99% of the time. there are times where something could have been done better or something got a little rushed (really only happens in the last episode). but the show is VERY VERY well written and the direction is top notch. it was the right decision to make this show as three made for tv movies I think. I would not expect less from the man who revived Doctor Who though. the series contain a majority of the original case that they adapt (for example \\"a study in pink\\"), and do fairly well for itself on it's own. you can tell that a lot of love and reverence where paid to the original stories when you watch the show. the characters are intact, while still being believable modern, for example Sherlock love of texting. speaking of texting when ever someone receives one the show does something rather unique and smart. instead of switching to a pan shot of the phone, they typeset (or superimpose) the message next to the phone in the persons hand. this would not work for every show, however it works wonderfully for Sherlock. if you a fan of mysteries at all you owe it to yourself to watch this show on masterpiece mystery (which is on pbs, october 24- november 7) or buy it, or heck both. this is a great show, and I love my pre-order of it.

0553805371|3.0|I wanted to edit this review and explain that I have been pondering this book, and now I understand what the authors are saying; I see how negative gravity could have created the universe, because gravity exists and all particles can possibly cycle through all points and times of the universe, including the beginning. I bumped my review up from 2 stars to 3 stars because I did end up learning something new that has given me food for thought for a couple of weeks. However, I still find the book to be poorly-written, designed, and edited. Here is my original review:<br /><br />This is the very first book I ever pre-ordered on my Kindle. I was so excited to see this was coming out, and when it was downloaded into my Kindle, I could not wait to read it. I started saying \\"huh\\"? when I ran across the first of many odd, 1970's-looking cartoons that are interspersed throughout the book for seemingly no reason.<br /><br />Then the authors started cracking stupid and unfunny jokes, which were made even more annoying because some of them use British phrases such as \\"clotted cream\\". I don't know what \\"clotted cream\\" is, and I don't really care. It's not funny, at least not to me. Maybe their jokes, including remarks about ingrown toenails, would be funny to 7-year-olds reading this book.<br /><br />Because I really like Stephen Hawking, I gave it the ol' college try and kept slogging along ... the crux of the book seems to lean on an experiment where scientists shot balls of carbon atoms through two slits. Somehow, by looking at an interference pattern, scientists have come to the conclusion that particles travel through every possible place, nook, and cranny in the universe before somehow predicting and arriving at their final destination.<br /><br />I'm no stranger to science, but I simply did not see enough evidence for this kooky-sounding theory, and the authors did not provide any rebuttals to their argument or talk about any other viewpoints on the evidence. There did not seem to be any vigorous peer review/critiques discussed. It was weird.<br /><br />I thought that perhaps when the two slits were open, some sort of unknown energy/wave/particle naturally occurring in the universe, but as yet unknown, or an unknown behavior of a known substance, flowed differently through the two slits (vs. the one) and caused the buckyball pattern on the other side. I kept looking for the authors to talk about this very natural, common-sense question, but they never did.<br /><br />I feel like this book was rushed to print and is not what you imagine when you think of a \\"Stephen Hawking\\" book. I'd say wait for the price to come down, or get it from the library if you want to read it.review/critiques discussed. It was weird.

B003ZUTVJS|5.0|It's always inspiring - and humbling - to see someone overcome great odds with native-intelligence and courage. Even though afflicted with autism, Temple Grandin thought her life ought to count for something. And she made it happen - on both personal and professional levels. Supported at-arm's-length by her mother's love and wisdom and encouraged by others close to her, Temple battled her way though high-school, then college; eventually earning not only a Ph.D. but the admiration and gratitude of countless people dealing with autism. Using unique abilities bestowed/burdened upon her by autism, she envisioned equipment and processes that would allow beef cattle to live without fear or discomfort right up to the second they \\"leave\\" (to wherever they go when their bodies become simply beef). Because Temple also correctly envisioned and sold the concept of increased cost-efficiency to business people around the country, her equipment and processes are employed today at nearly half of all slaughterhouses in America.    I thought the movie extremely well done. While it incidentally (and entertainingly) sheds needed light on a couple of the myriad difficulties that confront those with autism, the film's strength is in the story of a remarkable woman who, when she \\"leaves\\" (to go wherever), will have left her corner of the world better off than when she came. Her story is a source of hope and enlightenment in this age when autism appears to be on the rise, but it's easy to imagine that Temple Grandin's story might also inspire others - autistic or otherwise - to live lives that personally \\"count for something\\".
B0036TGSR6|5.0|Roman Polanski has succeeded in making another brilliant and beautiful film that stands along \\"Rosemary's Baby\\" and \\"Chinatown\\" in a cycle of breathtaking film. His films hold up during repeated viewings and this one actually improves with each viewing.  Ewan McGregor is always a standout and this is to-date his best performance.  Pierce Bronson has excelled himself also in this gorgeously photographed and edited film. Again the truly great films never seen to win awards - but they last and this will stand the test of time.
B003O86MY8|4.0|Rapid and loud.  A different take on some old rock favorites.   I enjoyed listening.
B003HYNB34|4.0|I loved Christopher Eccelston, and switching to David Tennant was pretty easy to do. I didn't think it would be, but Tennant turned out to be the quintessential Who, which is how I used to see Eccelston. So when it was announced there would be another Doctor, I wasn't afraid. BBC seems to have a pretty good eye for talent; but as far as Matt Smith goes, he's kinda good, kinda bad. At first, it seems he's trying to emulate Tennant at every turn and you spend the first few episodes being forcibly reminded that Smith isn't Tennant. I really couldn't stand Smith, but I decided to overlook his acting just because I loved the storylines so much and I'm glad I did. Once Smith decided to stop trying to be Tennant and be his own Doctor, he actually got kind of cool, and by the end I actually liked Matt Smith. That said, I'm still trying to decide whether or not I like Amy Pond, the new companion.    SPOILERS!!! SKIP TO NEXT PARAGRAPH IF YOU DON'T WANT SPOILERS!!!    Amy Pond starts off a little girl that meets the Doctor after the Tardis crash lands in her yard. It turns out she's got a crack in her wall that whispers to her and glows, so the Doctor goes to take a look, then leaves with the mending Tardis, making a promise to be back in five minutes. Skip ahead to the future and the Doctor lands again, though he meant to land a lot sooner than 12 years into Amy's future. Here he and Amy team up briefly to halt the Atraxi (the people/things behind the crack) and once again, the Doctor leaves, again promising to be right back. Two years after that, he's finally back, the Tardis is brand new (and looks way better than the old one,) has a new screwdriver, (the one River Song handed him in the previous season,) and finds Amy... again. They leave. Eventually the Doctor finds out Amy left the eve of her wedding and has since been having doubts whether to get married or not. When they return briefly to Amy's time again, she decides to accost the Doctor, tries seducing him, and kisses him. From here until the death of her fiance, she continuously wonders whether or not to marry Rory. (Her fiance's name.) Even in the episode where she is forced to make a decision between Rory or the Doctor, she still remains indecisive after the incident is over. For me, personally, I don't like that kind of behavior. She basically led on her fiance instead of being straight with him and used the Doctor as a crutch.    END SPOILERS    That said, while I disliked that part of her personality, especially since they bring it up so often in the course of the season, I did like quite a bit about her. She is a strong personality, fairly intelligent, and doesn't seem to be too afraid of much. So I do like her, but not all of her. Some parts of her annoyed me to no end.    In this season River Song makes another appearance, four infact, and you learn a bit more about her. She's a little more annoying than she was in the last season, but still enjoyable to watch. Turns out there's a lot more to her than just being an archeologist. I won't say any more than that though.    All in all, most of the episodes were either decent to great, most being good. The show takes a little while to warm up while Matt Smith struggles to figure out what type of Doctor he wants to be, but once he finally does figure it out, the show gets much better. I was sad to see David Tennant go, but his replacement seems to be doing a good job in his place. I say give the show a chance, and possibly give it a few episodes worth of a chance, especially if you are a diehard fan of Tennant and refuse to accknowledge anyone else as the Doctor. Smith will win you over eventually.
0385341008|5.0|Like most of the other reviewers, I really enjoyed this book.<br /><br />Granted, I have a soft spot for all things British and find the WWII era somewhat \\"romantic\\" (despite the tragic realities of war)- but never-the-less there was something so appealing and heart-warming about the characters in this book that reading it made me feel good, even though some bad things happen in the story.<br /><br />I wish I could find a more articulate way to express my feelings, but the characters felt so real that it struck me as an \\"antidote\\" to the cold, impersonal, virtual, digital world we all seem to be inhabiting these days. Perhaps there is a gentleness about it that I find comforting.<br /><br />Others reviews have summarised the plot and explained the letter-based format of the book. The biggest selling point for me, aside from the genre/era, was the author's ability to make me believe I was reading about(and caring about)real people.<br /><br />I notice most reviewers/readers have been female. I'm a chap and I enjoyed it - I don't think this book should be considered \\"chic-lit\\" as I have heard some people say.
0307269752|4.0|Much better written than the Da Vinci Code, yet this book has a resemblance, in that it contains that certain something that catches one's imagination and fancy, and together they wind themselves upward in a series of 'what if' questions. It takes a good while to engage, but once the foundation is laid, it is a very well-crafted, clever spellbinder. Just one final thing to add -- it's very interesting that the author died shortly after this was published. Read it and ponder that -- I did.

B000E1YVZU|4.0|I purchased from Capital City Outlet and received disc one of a two disc special edition of \\"Rent\\". The sellers quickly responded upon learning this information to apologize for the mistake and offered amends by providing a full refund upon return of the product or a partial refund for the unreceived disc.  The seller expressed that they, regrettably, were unable to locate the second disc and did not intend to mislead me in my purchase.  I received the feature film which was in excellent condition, as well as the case art (I am big on condition of cases as well). I understand mistakes happen. Overall, my experience has been good with this seller as they quickly tried to find a solution to the problem, and, of course, the feature film was in excellent condition!  In considering the facts - admitting to a mistake, being solution-oriented, and offering a quality product - I would definitely purchase from this seller again. ...very consumer oriented.
0141439610|5.0|Collins spins a web of intrigue among the fascinating characters he creates and develops so intricately that they spring to life. He sets them in fascinating places, and with his imagination and blazing talent, he paints the setting perfectly. He has created an immensely compelling work, and it delivers at every setting.<br /><br />This was written in installments, and one can but wonder how eagerly the next segment must have been anticipated back in the time of Dickens, his good friend. Thankfully, the installments are all gathered together and presented as one.<br /><br />The wonderful thing about a book of this length is that, if done well (and IT IS!!), the characters are intricately detailed, and can be known in depth. And what characters!! Mr. Hartright, Miss Fairlie, Miss Halcombe, Anne Catherick, and the uncle Fairlie still linger, as if old friends and acquaintances. Even the minor characters, such as the lumpish maid at Blackwater, is so perfectly detailed and used that she made a lasting impression. Sir Percy and his entourage will linger in memory, as well.<br /><br />This work made Collins very famous, and it has put him on my wall of favorites. Way up at the top!
B0028RXXFC|5.0|I had not seen this before so didn't know what quite to expect. As it turns out, it was one of the best that I have seen. Story is told more or less from the eyes of two legionaries. The whole experience is absolutely great, bravery, treachery, betrayal, deceit you get to see all this in a grand fashion. Do watch.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I love this workout because it is only 20 minutes and you see fast results.  It is difficult but only 20 minutes so I can push myself through it without feeling like I lost time from my already busy day.  I really recommend it.  I've done a lot of workout videos and this is by far my favorite.
0307266303|5.0|I have been running for 25 years, including competitive high school and NCAA Division I Cross Country.  As a result of reading this book and thinking through my own running experiences, I have concluded that my \\"heel strike\\" running style is flawed and has led to unnecessary injuries.  Over the course of the past two months, I have converted to a forefoot running style that comes naturally when we run barefoot.  I now view the traditional running shoe as an injury facilitator and have thrown mine out.  I am currently running in Asics Piranha racing flats and Vibram Five Finger KSOs.  The plantar fasciitis that has been lingering in my left foot for 8 months regardless of taking a break, has now subsided.  I fully believe it is the result of changing my running style and gradually adding mileage (because the calves do much more work under this style and it takes a few weeks of muscle fatigue/pain before they strengthen) with these shoes that either have no heel (VFF KSOs) or minimal heel (Piranhas).  I'm interested in evaluating the coming \\"minimalist\\" shoes that allow the foot to work properly rather than have the shoe do the work the body was naturally made for. There is something for everyone in this amazing book and I highly recommend it.

0321543726|2.0|I'm on page 256 of this 1k+ page book so about 1/4 the way through.  I am not a complete newbie, I guess I fit the term advanced beginner having read other beginner books and wrote some intermediate level stuff.  So I thought this book would be full of projects and how to actually use the language of c++ in real programming environments.  The first few chapters were noob chapters and these did not go into enough spoon feeding for any true absolute beginner to understand.  There just isn't any way you can squeeze the basics + syntax of c++ into a few small chapters.  If your looking for a beginner book, try the absolute beginner book by micheal dawson.  Then after these beginner chapters he goes right into error handling (with try,catch,throw) which in most books is left to the very end because of its high level of complexity, and then into making a calculator application.  This is not a easy to understand program it includes parsing tokenizing and more complex topics that would be better split into different chapters later in the book. Then he switches gears yet again before finishing the calculator app (total cliff hanger here) and moves on to chapter 8.  Here at the beginning of chapter 8 he starts talking about declaring and defining variables and functions which has been (obliviously) in use this whole time since chapter 3, and extensively in the calculator application (which woulda been a foreign language if you were a beginner) and the error handling chapters.  He jumps around like this so much it makes it extremely hard to follow or to know what you should remember from each chapter.  It's becoming obvious that this guy is a genius and master of programming, and has since forgotten what it was like to be a newbie in the field of programming.     I will keep updating this review if amazon will let me as I complete this book.      UPDATE:  Im now on page 351 I cannot recommend this book its hard to follow and defiantly not for beginners.  I keep trying to get into the book but he never really gets a project going before he trashes it and moves on to something else.  I've read multiple c++ books and know how boring  they can be and this one is no different.  I'm near the end of chapter 10 now and we have started and never finished so many projects that it seems like thats all he does is start to make something cool and then say woops i guess we haven't covered this difficult topic yet so lets just give up and move on,  chapter after chapter same story.
0316069884|4.0|I was curious about this book when I noticed it was recommended by readers of the Kind Diet. I immediately obtained a copy from the library and began to read. It starts off slow, as he discusses his childhood and grandmother, then delves into the real subject of the book.<br />I'm a educated person that spent a summer on a dairy farm while a teenager, but in reading this, I found that I knew nothing about the horrors animals are subjected to in factory farming. I can't believe that animals are subjected to such cruelty. I knew in the end of their lives that they are slaughtered to place on the kitchen/dining table. Having spent a summer on a dairy farm where the cows lived in safety chewing the grass and soaking under the sun and breathing the air,I had no idea that factory farm animals never spent their lives in such luxury. They are tortured, treated as mere objects before they are even born and the torture continues in the kill rooms and being slaughtered even while they are still conscious. No wonder they have to lock the doors of their buildings. I have to ask the workers and owners of these factory farms: how on earth do you sleep at night? How on earth do you even look at yourself in the mirror? And don't say they're just animals, because they are living, breathing, helpless, harmless animals that ask nothing of us and they deserve better than you give them. May you suffer the same fate you dole out someday.<br />It is a terrible shame that family farms that treated their animals with humanity and dignity have dwindled to almost nothing only to be replaced by factory farms interested in nothing but the almighty dollar, which I find ironic: an average of 10 to 15% of animals die in the factory farms, but the business makes so much money that it is a mere loss. Imagine, how much more money you could make if no animals died? If you treated the animals humanely they wouldn't die and your profits would grow. Think about it.<br />I love meat, at least I did. Is it wrong to kill animals humanely to feed our stomachs? I'm not going to go there, because that is your choice.<br />As for me, I read this book a month ago and I haven't touched meat since. The mere thought of filling the pockets of farm factories with my money sickens me. The mere thought of consuming meat they murdered disgusts me even more. As my title of this review says, if you're not a vegetarian now, you may well be by time you finish this book. It hits home. It's sad. It is so bloody unnecesary.ll animals humanely to feed our stomachs? I'm not going to go there, because that is your choice.

0765326353|5.0|This book (and series) has the makings of one of the all time great fantasy series. I felt the same way reading this as when I sat reading \\"The Wheel of Time\\" or \\"Game of Thrones\\" for the first time. There are plenty of good fantasy stories out there, enough variety for anyone; but this is high fantasy done at it's best.    It took me a little time to get started on this. I was sick the last week and nyquil and late reading don't seem to mix well. As this cold is fading I've been able to dig in and finish it the last couple days. Partly because of the addicting nature of the story as well.    As someone who loves characters first and foremost, every character in this book is well done. Kaladin was the character I got into quickest, others took a bit longer for me to form that eagerness for; but eventually they all came to the same level.    His world feels nearly alien in it's uniqueness. Not something I require of my fantasy, but knowing this is going to be a ten book series it's nice to see. He does such a good job with fleshing out the world that by the end, it really doesn't feel alien anymore. In fact at one point a good way through they come to an area that seems fairly \\"earthlike\\" and the characters there find it odd and I was right along with them.    The plot is exactly what it should be for something that will last ten books and probably over a decade of writing. Epic. The single novel itself reads well enough and wraps up well enough, but you still feel like you read the first chapter and want more. Not so much because of major cliffhangers, but because you are involved in the world and the characters and want to stay there. Sanderson does an outstanding job of weaving the plots together as it moves forward.    The magic is unique, well done and well explained. Still more left on the table to learn; but I feel like the reader got plenty to understand what was happening and how. Most of all it fits the world's unique feel.    Outside of the overall review,I have to say a couple things I normally don't like in fantasies: Odd quotes that don't make sense under chapter titles and prophecies and guidance by godlike figures that are more riddles than anything else. Both of these were in the book and handled beautifully. The prophecy thing when it finally crested most I nearly started to get frustrated, when the explanation came and it all made sense (more sense than any other time I've seen it tried). and, Once you are into the story you understand the purpose of the quotes and they just become additional artwork.    Speaking of artwork, I loved all the extras in this book. Of course it had the map many fantasy stories have, but it also had drawings throughout the story of cities, creatures and other sketches (work that looked like you were peaking into sketchbooks of that world, not just standard art). It also had nice headers to every chapter.    I can't recommend this story enough if you are a true fantasy fan. Especially if you like series like the Wheel of Time (fitting he is finishing that for Jordan) and a Song of Fire and Ice.

B000LB7G00|4.0|First off, let me make one thing clear about this review: I did not buy this device to use with any commercial software (CAD, etc). I bought it to use with my own homebrew software project, so my review concerns only the hardware and device driver - i.e. I cannot make any claims either way about how well it works with any popular applications.    That being said, let's put the most important info out there first: the device itself seems to be really well built (though I can't yet vouch for how well it functions in the long-term). It feels well-made; very sturdy, nice materials, with a really good 'feel' to the springs in the cap. Control is smooth and precise, certainly better than any joystick I've ever used - it just feels slick.    The installation process was simple and the training/demo software supplied in the box is decent enough. I particularly liked the 3D tetris-style puzzle - that really shows off the flexibility of a full 6DOF device, and definitely helped get me comfortable using it. I'd say it only takes a couple of minutes to get the basic swing of using the device, and a couple of hours to get comfortable performing subtle or complex motions. I was pleasantly surprised at how quick this was - especially given that I am not using the device with my dominant hand (3DConnexion recommends putting it on the other side of your keyboard to your mouse, and that does indeed seem to work well).    The driver supplies a 'control panel' utility which lets you tweak how the device behaves when used in specific applications. The behaviour and layout of this utility seems sensible, though the degree of control offered is a bit limited; you can't remap axes arbitrarily, nor adjust dead zones, nor apply mouse-style 'acceleration'. As I say, though, this was irrelevant to me, since my personal software ended up communicating directly with the device.    As an aside to any other developers interested in using this device: the sample source code in the SDK works as intended, and provides you with all the example code you need to get started talking to the device from your own software. The 'API' is very simple (if you use 'raw input' mode, as I did) and the device driver happily doesn't do anything 'clever' behind your back which could cause you any headaches. You just get the raw numbers from the device that you'd expect. I had the device working in my software within an hour, with another hour or two spent tweaking it to 'feel' really good (dead zones, power curves, damping, etc).      Given the above, this could be a 5-star rating... but there are a few minor faults which bring it down to 4 stars. Here they are:   - rotations counter-act translations: for example, while pulling the cap fully to the left (causing fast leftward panning), twisting the cap from above will actually reduce the strength of the panning. Each pan axis is adversely affected by 2 of the rotation axes in this way. In a 6-DOF device, all degrees of freedom should be fully independent, so this interaction is not ideal and can be annoying when performing certain camera maneuvers in 3D space. Applications can correct for this to some degree (I added hacks to mostly hide the problem in my software), but I doubt you can rely on most applications doing so (I tried Google Earth briefly, and it did not correct for this problem at all).   - tilting is limited by the base: if you press the cap down, this limits your ability to tilt the cap forwards/back/sideways, since it collides with the base of the device. That's another unfortunate coupling between degrees of freedom which can limit certain camera maneuvers (e.g. moving downwards while tilting the camera up)   - I think the base could do with being *slightly* heavier, especially since there's a lighter notebook version for people who would prefer a lighter option. A heavier base would allow me to use the device slightly more comfortably; I could use fewer fingers, since I wouldn't have to prevent it from sliding.- I find the buttons on the device hard to use, given how they are positioned. They would be much more accessible to me if they were semicircles built into the rim of the cap.    These definitely seem like minor design flaws which could be fixed in the next version - there's nothing fundamentally wrong with this device as a concept. Even as it is, I would whole-heartedly recommend it to a friend. Or stranger, actually.
B002ZG983M|5.0|I am not a comic book reader, per se, but I do pick up select titles and graphic novels occasionally when something looks at the edge.  I had read the Kick Ass series and when I heard a movie was to come out, I was doubtful.  First, the movie is superior to the book.  The plot was changed slightly for the movie, and it is far better than the basis of the book.  Second, Big Daddy's costume is far better than the comic version and Nicholas Cage did a fantastic job!  As for the dialog, well, that's the way it was in the series, and it actually came off better in the movie.  The music, it just plain rocks! If you watch the movie with the commentary on, you will see how much effort was put into the soundtrack.  Excellent!  This is one cool action movie!
B0032JTV6U|5.0|This is show is AMAZING!!  It's a lot of fun, and the music is great!  Even my husband, who pretends that he hates it and teases me for watching it, will sit down with me when it's on.  And he knows the character's names.  If you're looking for a fun new show this is it.  It does have some songs/scenes that might be a little racey for younger kids (ie Madonna's \\"Like a Virgin\\"), but over all the show is pretty family friendly.      People who are giving it a low review are the people who bought Season One: Part One when it came out, for the same price as the complete season.  Now they have to buy Season One: Part Two to complete their set.  I would be a little upset too, but that's why I waited. I didn't want to have to pay full price twice.
0316098337|5.0|Room by Emma Donoghue has got to be alongside The Book Thief by Markus Zusak as my top reads of 2010. It's that good, it's that different, and you absolutely must read it.    As I started writing this review, I realized that Room and The Book Thief are similar in that both have young protagonists who have to deal with very dark issues: the anti-Semitism in WWII Germany in the case of The Book Thief and a five-year-old boy who's lived his whole life in an 11' by 11' room with his kidnapped mother. You would think that both would be depressing books, but both authors pull off the astonishing feat of creating stories that find beauty in what is ugly, that celebrates the best of human spirit, even as it depicts its worst. Viewing a world as dark as WWII Germany or as confined and limited as \\"Room\\" through a young child's eyes infects the reader with a sense of wondrous possibility - this is where Room succeeds.     I dare anyone to read Room and not be enchanted with five-year-old Jack, through whose perspective we witness an extraordinary existence as defined by being prisoners in an 11 by 11 foot room. Jack, having been born in Room (as he calls it) and nurtured by Ma, his only other companion for all of his 5 years, does not see it as a prison. It's just the world as he knows it. Because of his mother's ingenuity, perseverance, and fierce, protective love, Jack is as healthy, bright, curious, and intelligent as a child can be under the circumstances.     Jack doesn't know that his mother was kidnapped as a 19-year-old college student seven years ago; he doesn't know what Old Nick does when he comes at night; nor does he know that there is an outside world. His mother has protected him from knowing of any ugliness or that he is deprived in any way.     What fascinated me is how Ma has made everything an adventure for Jack - their days are filled with creative activities that make use of what little they're given by Old Nick. I kept thinking as I read Room, what wouldI do in this situation? Would I have done as well as Jack's mother? Would I have had the patience and sanity and imagination?    I was so caught up in their story that I stopped reading when it came to Ma and Jack's daring escape attempt. I was terrified for them; I had to step back for a day and only returned when my curiosity got the better of me.     Room is an amazing novel. If the subject matter worries you - I would urge you to read it anyway because the reader is never treated to anything graphic. Donoghue handles this horrifying subject carefully yet realistically.    But it was Jack who pulled me into this story - his \\"voice\\" and outlook, much like any bright and precocious child's, is delightful, funny, and captivating.

B000I9YX06|3.0|Good popcorn flick, but...    It's easier for me to believe that we will have walking, talking robot helpers in the year 2035 than it is for me to believe that only one, lone detective will be worried that they might, potentially be dangerous. Why Hollywood needs to set up these scenarios is beyond me. Take out 1 minute of fluff and give me a couple of short scenes where someone actually agrees with Will Smith's suspicions in the first 30 minutes of the movie...Then I'll give it a solid 4 stars. It would have taken so little for this to have been a movie that both critics and the general public could have gotten behind.     This movie could have been smart AND entertaining. Instead, we will have to settle for just entertaining.    If you haven't read any Asimov, please do!!

B00004XPPK|5.0|Only when the movie has finished do you realise how silly it was. Convincing noir.
B003AMAOW4|5.0|This is a fabulous performance, captured with state of the art video and sound.  The updated ( to Germany of the 1930's) staging is sensible and does not get in the way of the glorious music.  The conducting and cast could hardly be better.  Jonas Kaufmann is the most compelling Lohengrin I ever expect to see or hear.  Beautiful sound at all levels and movie star looks with terrific acting.  Harteros is no less satisfying.

B000059Z8J|5.0|SPOILERS FOLLOW<br /><br />Director Richard Donner's 1978 film \\"Superman - The Movie\\" is an amazing accomplishment.  Starring Christopher Reeve, Gene Hackman, and Marlon Brando it redefined the approach to comic book treatment and media.  It is the genesis of the mature comic book movie, a phenomenon we are still enjoying today.<br /><br />It tells the classic \\"Superman\\" origin story, and wisely takes its time to humanize the character.  Superman himself doesn't appear until nearly an hour into the movie, and the viewer does not feel cheated at all.  Instead, the movie spends time on both Krypton and Earth establishing Clark Kent at different phases of his life.  Acting luminaries Marlon Brando and Susannah York play Superman's Kryptonian parents Jor-El and Lara very well. As the movie shifts to young Clark's rural home of Smallville, his Earth parents Jonathan and Martha Kent are capably played by Glenn Ford and Phyllis Thaxter.  When he does eventually turn up, Christopher Reeve is magnificent in the dual role of the mature Clark Kent and Superman, effortlessly capturing the differences between the characters and embodying each character perfectly.  He is supported by Margot Kidder as Lois Lane, the role for which the actress is probably still best known.  Gene Hackman's Lex Luthor is humorous, but not without a very hard edge.<br /><br />This DVD edition is the first release to feature significant previously unseen footage(although a minor deleted shot of Christopher Reeve in the Fortress of Solitude was in original U.S. movie trailers).  The alterations are mostly more of Marlon Brando and Christopher Reeve in the Fortress of Solitude.  Overall, it's a fuller, more satisfying release than previously available.<br /><br />Also featuring a brilliant orchestral score from John Williams and a versatile screenplay co-written by Mario Puzo(\\"The Godfather\\"), \\"Superman - The Movie\\" is a classic.<br /><br />P.S.  It is specifically called 'The Movie' because the conceptof a mature superhero movie was new, and the label was used to stress to audiences of the time that it was a serious movie.
B0037QGS0A|1.0|Truly terrible. The \\"surprise\\" isn't concealed very well, so it won't really surprise you. The ending is preposterous. This may be the only performance of Julianne Moore's career that was not excellent; instead it was mediocre. The pacing of the film is really slow, which is saying something for 96 minutes. In short, it's neither \\"erotic\\" nor \\"a thriller.\\"
B000063DIR|1.0|This isn't the original. It's remixed and had the bass and drum tracks re-recorded. Avoid this one like the pile of crap it is, seek out the one with the original music intact, you'll be glad you did.
030745455X|5.0|The women who I talk to seem to be way more into this series than the men...funny given the graphic content and misogynistic undertones. I think it's just because Lisbeth Salander is a protagonist unlike any that's ever existed. I heard someone say recently that there are no good female superheroes. In my opinion she's a modern day superhero complete with disguises, fighting skills, an archenemy and, after book one, unlimited wealth to fund her \\"projects\\".<br /><br />I loved the second book as much as the first, but on a completely different level. It more page by page action and suspense. I would read on the train, get off and read on the platform, get in my car and keep reading, read when I sat down at work, read when I got home...I kept saying, \\"Just one more page...just one more page\\". Needless to say, I couldn't put it down.<br /><br />The only complaint that I have about \\"The Girl\\" series is the overabundance of characters. A lot of characters are fairly easy to follow onscreen, but in a book they start to blend into each other; especially when they are similarly described (e.g., twenty different gang members who all seem to be fumbling idiots with beer guts and pony tails).<br /><br />I CANNOT wait to read the next one. I had to restrain myself from stopping and buying it on the way home last night.

B003U6BE8I|1.0|... you are a 10 year old boy. The plot, acting, and polish of this movie were extremely weak.   It is likely good enough to entertain a 10-12 year old but is NOT for adult consumption. Save your self $2 and hours of your life.
B002S0OBMS|4.0|okay, basically this is a sequel set ten years after the original PHANTOM. Raoul is an abusive, drunken gambler, Meg is an ex-whore who opens for the Phantom's Coney Island show, and Christine hasn't changed much. oh, and Raoul and Christine now have a son, Gustave.       despite widespread hate-mongering from those jackals what call themselves the Media, LOVE NEVER DIES is actually pretty good. the tone of the show tends to shift rapidly and unexpectedly, seeming almost manic-depressive in its wild mood swings. mostly, though, it is drastically different from PHANTOM. where PHANTOM had darkly dramatic music such as Music of the Night and Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again, LOVE NEVER DIES has airy, soaring vocals that verily burst at the seams with emotion.       the best song is definitely the Phantom's new theme, Til' I Hear You Sing. it is a haunting and heartrending love ballad that very much carries the show on its shoulders. seriously, i would happily pay the extravagant $56 ticket price simply to hear Til' I Hear You Sing live.       the one regret i find is that we don't see the return of any of PHANTOM's musical themes. seems they should be there, as this is a sequel, right?       despite what critics say about LOVE NEVER DIES, it is actually very good. the problem is that all the critics went in expecting something as grand as PHANTOM. really, that's setting the bar somewhat ridiculously high, don't you think? there's maybe three or four shows in the past century that come near the quality of PHANTOM. and even if LOVE NEVER DIES isn't one of them, it's still better than 70 percent of the shows out there.
B003ITZBVS|5.0|I wasn't expecting this movie to be as good as it is. I was expecting just an 'okay' film. But I'm happily surprised. Mainly how good the VA was. All the characters sounded right, and DiMaggio as the Joker was a welcome change (as much as I like Mark Hamill as Joker, I don't think he would've fit this version of the Joker well.) The main plot point you can see coming, but I was never too sure who 'it' was and I had no idea as to how the other plot points would fall into place.    This whole film feels familiar, but still fresh in how it carries itself. If you're a Batman fan, I'd at least give this a rent.
1400096936|2.0|The book is just an interesting piece of the new mass production of best sellers.    It artfully concots historical facts with plenty of fiction to create a new, \\" revealing \\" history, which appeals a lot to subcultivated people anxious \\" to understand \\" recent history. A Dan Brown´s sequel, only to ilustrate the \\" true history\\" of Mexico-United States relations in the last 40 years.    The gore, the vicious, the saints,  all mixed up with a leftist but very populist bias to explain why Mexico became a drug powerhouse. It was the US politics, and his defense of the free world in the 70´and 80´s against southern and central communists which aided to grow the modern leviathan of mexican drug cartels.     In the book it´s not missed not a single cliché nor a modern pulp fiction heroe. From the cold blooded assasin, dully tortured trying to redeem himself, to the  extraimplausible mafia boss-political liason, ex green beret, to extreme villains- impersonated by the drug lords- with a gist to appear humans in  rigid paper thin personalities.    The heroes are of course the lone DEA rider, unjustly persecuted by their political bosses, the honest whore cooperating against evil, the liberation theology-cum mexican bishop dully sacrified, and their counterparts, mirrors of Annibal Lecters supernatural powers, the Barreras brothers with their omnipotent and omniscient supreme capabilities.    Action, a frenzy of it, killings, italian-american mafia, irish mafia, state sponsored chinese mafia, and above all, mexican mafia, undistinguishable from mexican political power. And a lot of torture, gore, decapitations, devious machinations, conspirations, all fitting manoeuvres, etcetera.    The book very irritantingly puts a word or two in spanish every two pages to accomodate a colorfoul ethnic note. But, it is quite incredibly how they are full of mispellings, unintelligible words, fake spanish even in the dialectal variety of mexican scumbag lumpen gansgter spanish. Mojado,\\"wet\\" for illegal inmigrant is \\" mujado\\" about a hundred times, Tirofijo ( a famous military leader of the Farc guerilla) becomes \\" Tirofio\\" with an altogheter different meaning. This reveals the depths of historical research in the events tried to describe, almost all connected to mexican history of the last 40 years.    In short, a just for fun gangsters book for the masses.
B000065M00|5.0|This arrived on time and in the condition I was expecting.  I would recommend this seller
0439023513|4.0|Ah, Mockingjay.  Just like every other Hunger Games fan, I've been eagerly awaiting the third and final installment of the trilogy ever since Catching Fire came out last August. I'm not sure exactly what I was expecting it to be like; obviously there wouldn't be another Games, due to the rebellion, which was disappointed me a bit. The Games had always been the part that fascinated me the most. But anyway, I knew it would be exciting nonetheless.     As far as the romance angle, I was figuring it would be wrapped up somehow, and that a big chunk of the book would focus on it, like in the first two books. However...I was wrong, about the plot/romance/etc...and I'm not sure I really liked it.    SPOILERS:  So the first chunk of the book, Katniss is with Gale, and Peeta is just...gone. With the Capitol, I guess. And Katniss spends about 3 seconds tops worrying about him, and then he's just forgotten. Completely! So that right there was a bit of a disappointment for those of us rooting for Peeta. When Peeta finally is taken back, he's not the same Peeta that we all fell in love with. And for that matter, neither is Katniss. She has no spunk, and instead chooses to spend her days moping around, or sleeping in closets. And she's absolute horrid to Peeta. There's no forgiveness or sympathy for everything he's been through. Instead she almost acts like she blames HIM for being hijacked! There's no chemistry between them, or for that matter, between Katniss and anyone.    And the mood, ugh. The Hunger Games and Catching Fire both dealt with some depressing, morbid material, and the overall concept wasn't a pleasant one. And yet they were...light-hearted? I'm not sure how to describe it, but somehow the first two were absolutely enthralling, and while they were certainly upsetting in parts, they didn't have a morbid, somber feel to them. Mockingjay was a totally different story. It was completely focused on the war, and it was just bloodbath after bloodbath. The overall mood was horribly somber and it just left me feeling like I wanted to go curl up in a dark corner or something, and have myself a good cry.    The characters weren't the same, the mood wasn't the same, and it just...didn't flow with the first two. However, it DID have its good moments. There was a fair bit of action, and a few shocking twists, and of course the ending was good for those of us Peeta fans. I really only rated it 4 stars though just because I'm such a massive fan of the trilogy, and it felt wrong to rate it lower than that. But it definitely was not as good as the Hunger Games and Catching Fire. Or maybe not as good isn't quite right; it was good, but it was just enormously different.
0739344269|3.0|I purchased the audio book of The Grand Design and I have just completed my first \\"reading\\" of this book. I'll begin by saying this book is not for everyone, especially those with limited background or exposure to physics and some higher mathmetics. Many, many laws and terms are used through-out the book in order to establish some of the priciples of quantum physics theory for the reader and how it is used to predict the \\"multiverse\\".    I recommend this book in hard copy to anyone with an interest in science, physics, and most importantly, an open mind regarding religious beliefs.     I find the theories and proofs in this book more believable than the divine creator theory, but that's my opinion.
B0032JTV6U|1.0|Not that many people like this show and i got a digital copy of it from my friend on iTunes. I guess it's ok that they are making it all one season available and if you have to buy it get the Blue Ray version less disc more quality Blue Ray is great. I've seen several episodes and find it very annoying some of the individuals. The song choices are ok but you can;t get what you want. A lot of show tunes nothing really that great and amazing or recent. Single ladies is an annoying song. If you like great Fox shows pass this one as Birds of Prey was even better.

6304458304|5.0|Clint Eastwood stars as a disgraced secret service agent named Frank Horrigan who blames himself for the assissination of John F. Kennedy. Thirty years later he is on the trail of a sociopath named Mitch Leary (John Malkovich) who singled out Horrigan for a game of sorts to see how close he'll get to prevent him from killing the president.     In a way this is a Dirty Harry-esque film with a few of the classic cliches, the partner being murdered and the top brass refusing to cooperate, but most importantly it's not. Frank Horrigan is not like good ole Harry Callahan, Frank is a functioning alcoholic who has nothing going on his life other than his job. Also Clint is not afraid to show his age, he does a lot of heaving breathing when he's running and comes down with a nasty cold standing in the rain during one of the President's addresses. Mitch Leary and Horrigan are both alike in the sense that they are two men who have not much to live for and Mitch knows this of himself and Frank; At one point Mitch asks Frank if he asks anything to live for and all he can muster after a brief pause is \\"I can play the piano\\". Also their goals seem equally as futile, Mitch realizes he is doing little more than challenging himself for one last kill; He really isn't going after the men whom he felt responsible for making him a \\"monster\\". Frank, despite being one of principle investigators to find Leary, is totally disdant from the president. Not once do you see Frank talking to the president and you actually don't even know his full name, he's only seen making speeches throughout the film. The closest thing Frank gets to actually talking to the President is through the ignorant, blowhard, Chief of Staff Harry Sargent played by Fred Dalton Thompson. So this film has a healthy combo of a summer blockbuster thriller and existentialism. My only complaint is the end. I think Frank should have been killed, not by Leary but by the sharp shooters who attempt to take Leary out at the end ofthe film. Overall, a great film.
B002ZG98UA|5.0|I am a huge fan of the Resident Evil movie series, but I must be honest and say that \\"Resident Evil: Afterlife\\" makes the other installments look like garbage by comparison.  The budget was much higher, and thus allowed for longer, more explosive battles, and a huge number of visuals, which range from Alaska, to Toyko, Los Angeles, inside of a maximum security prison, and on a boat.  The movie opens with a huge scene in the Umbrella facility headquarters, where Alice and her clones proceed to annihilate the entire facility. She literally kills almost everyone, taking down a sort-of hive at least ten times the size of any other in previous films. Albert Wesker escapes though, in a plane with the original Alice, and blows up the entire facility. He injects Alice, making her human again, before they crash. And this only the beginning.  Alice flies in a plane, and eventually reaches Alaska, trying to find \\"Arcadia.\\" There is no one there, just many planes. She is eventually attacked by Claire, who has a mechanical, parastic like device on her chest, and causes her to fight Alice. Alice wins, because she still is very strong even without her special powers from 2-3.  They move on, and head over Los Angeles, where they land the plane and meet up with new survivors, who are living in a maximum security prison. This is where the movie slows down a little, taking time to get Claire back to herself as she is suffering from memory loss, and meeting Chris Redfield. Huge spoiler!: Arcadia is a ship, and they can see it. So it's time to leave, and get there.  Unfortunately the \\"Executioner\\" shows up, and this is after evolved zombies dig holes and get inside. THey decide to use the tunnels they made as a means to escape, but not before the Executioner shows in the showers. Water shoots everywhere as he takes Claire and Alice on in the best part of the film. And, keep in mind, we are about half-way through at this point.  They get on \\"Arcadia,\\" which is supposed to be a safe shipfor survivors. Unfortunately, it is not. It is a huge trap concocted by Umbrella itelf. On it are 2, 000 prisoners, people they have collected to experiment on. This is a pretty messed up scene, which involves Alice confronting Wesker again. The people are released. This entire scene is very unique looking in that the entire interior is bright white.   What follows is the ultimate battle, with Wesker having two evolved dogs who go at Alice, while Claire and Chris go at Wesker. Cool Matrix style moves ensue (ones that look and feel far better than the movie that came out like ten years ago), in which Wesker is \\"supposedly\\" taking down. In case anyone wonders, the Perfect Circle song titled \\"The Outsider (Apocalypse Mix)\\" is used in this scene, as it was in the trailer. They shoot wesker many times, but he still manages to get up and take off. He goes to detonate the boat, but the bomb is planted on his plane, and he explodes, presumed dead.  They seem to have won but...tons of planes like Wesker's show all around. It is obvious Umbrella is planning what may be a huge \\"final stand.\\" And just when you think it cannot get any better, Jill Valentine, with one of the mechanical parasitic devices on her chest, is taking charge, and seems to directly address the audience about a huge battle coming.    Things that must be ackowledged further is the 3-D. Unlike the stupid cheap conversions used in many recent movies, they used the same system James Cameron used for Avatar, the real 3-D system, filmed with it. It is astounding, from the rain, to some simple blood splatters, glass, and the executioners weapons.   Another draw is the excellent score, composed of explosive rock/industrial sound music. I would say it was either up to par, or better than the composed soundtrack for the original, and hundred times better than the scores used for Apocalypse or Extinction.  Also, Chris finally came into the mix. I will now go onto game similarities. A huge draw is the Executioner fromRE4, but a lot of movie is composed from Code Veronica, from the prison situation mainly. More is definitely borrowed from \\"The Umbrella Chronicles\\" as well. In fact, in context to the games, I would say this movie is more faithful than 1 or Extinction (2 being the most faithful which was exactly like 3: Nemesisis in many cases).  Another plus point would be the growing number of heroines, hopefully the likes of Leon Kennedy or Rebecca Marshall will be added next time around.    So, all in all, this was an excellent movie. It outdid the entire franchise, and should easily outgross them as well. Be sure to see it in theatres, as one should not miss an actual, true 3-D experience.

1400079179|1.0|.... is how this book got published by a major house in the first place! This book is awful! If you consider flat characters, dull dialogue, plot \\"twists\\" you see coming miles ahead of you, and controversies and conspiracies that barely register a \\"so what?\\" level of response, then the \\"DaVinci Code\\" will be your cup of Teabing, er, tea.<br /><br />Robert Langdon's back, this time in Paris, to learn his after-dinner contact has been found murdered and naked in the middle of the Lourve. It seems he wrote a series of clues on his body and in the crime scene to lead his granddaughter and Langdon on a western European wild goose chase/ treasure hunt. Along the way, the cops and an albino monk are chasing them.<br /><br />Of course, nothing's what it seems, and each clue leads straight into another set-piece situation.<br /><br />Instead of hiding clues in a vault, in a mechanical puzzle written on papyrus, they should have been written on an old MAD magazine stuffed into a plastic Easter egg. And please don't get me started on what Grandpa was doing down in the basement ....
0374158460|5.0|Just finished it tonight.  I thought it was magnificent.  Which is what makes it somewhat surprising that the book was (slightly) marred by two errors that, had they been committed by a lesser talent, would be considered \\"beginner's mistakes.\\"  The first is that the book is 80% exposition and only 20% dramatic storytelling.  It's not as if Franzen isn't capable of writing dramatic scenes 'cause when he finally gets around to doing it, they're blockbusters.  The marital spats in particular are titanic.  But Franzen is just a guy with a terrible weakness for exposition, beautifully written though it may be.  Secondly, four chapters in the book are purportedly written by one of the characters as her \\"autobiography\\" (at the suggestion of her psychotherapist).  But it just so happens that her writing style is exactly like Jonathan Franzen's.  Not that there's anything bad about that style.  But it makes you wonder why she didn't choose to be a world-famous novelist instead of a receptionist at a health spa!
B003L20IJM|2.0|I had high hopes for this one, but we spent our money, ate our popcorn (well, most of it) and left the movie early.  My daughter was NOT (for the most part) entertained by this film.  She did enjoy the pigs swimming, but other than that, it did little to keep her attention.  It was as if we were watching the first Nanny movie (which is fantastic) with just a quick change in cast and setting.  There was nothing new offered that we could see, unless the last 15 minutes were earth shattering, which I doubt.<br /><br />I also found it somewhat disturbing when Nanny is first introduced to the children that she uses violent tactics to get them to listen to her.  They grab their own hair and hit their heads against the wall or floor...and while I know it's Nanny's style to make kids do things they can't control, (like in the first movie when the kids were messing up the kitchen) this one had a meaner edge to it and I felt it was a bit overdone.<br /><br />Sorry I can't give you better news...save your money on this one.<br /><br />**Addition to Review made 6/14/11**<br /><br />I have had the opportunity to view the entire film recently and wanted to add to my review.<br /><br />I still believe that the scene where Nanny is first introduced to the children is a bit overdone.  The violence these children perpetrated against themselves against their will was disturbing to me.  But...I must say that overall, the movie was a success...a lesson in family, selflessness, consideration, trust and compassion.  The very end made the whole movie worthwhile.  I wanted to say that I am not sure why the movie rubbed me so wrong the first time, nor am I sure why my daughter didn't like it the first time, but she and I both enjoyed it this second time and I wanted to update my review to reflect my reconsiderations.

B0034G4OWM|4.0|Nature finally gets back at us with a VENGEANCE!  Very cute premise...and yes, I see lots of reviews that say that parents can't tolerate this film, but really, that's what's wrong with \\"family\\" films these days.  They are made for kids, but also tweeked to appeal to adults and are full of crap that just doesn't belong in a kids film.  This is goofy fun MADE FOR KIDS.  We, as adults just have to sit there and be happy our kids are being entertained.  It doesn't really have to make sense to us.  It can be goofy and silly and funny and still be worth something.<br /><br />My 6 year old has watched this several times since we brought it home the other day.  She is pleased, so I am pleased.  There is NOTHING IN THIS FILM THAT WOULD BE CONSIDERED OFFENSIVE that I could see and I think most parents will be pleased, if not SLIGHTLY entertained!
B001HN694K|5.0|I know I would have loved watching this movie during my childhood, but today I was just watching it for the special effects it brings. In this regards, special effects and acting were great. I got bored watching it because I am not that much today into cartoons and entertainment material for children, but I'm sure kids would love watching it. I used to love the cartoon version of it when I was a child.     With the special effects in this movie, watching it 3D or as blu ray is a must.
B003RNU8KY|5.0|The Roots' How I Got Over is one part modern jazz with two parts old funk and to call it smooth would be an understatement. This is an album for people who abandoned rap music a decade ago because it lost its originality but still recognize talent when they hear it. There's nothing like a funky drummer to get your toe tapping and The Roots bring it on every cut. This is an early contender for best album of 2010 and will certainly end up in the top 10. Buy it, pop in your headphones, and brace your neck for the head bouncing to come.

B003EYVXYG|3.0|George A. Romero returns to his passion.  The living dead. Zombies. Flesh eating zombies. And he's getting tired.  He should have shelved his cadavers after, Night-Dawn and Day but he plods on and on and on and I am afraid some day we will see a posthumus Romero zombie flick, \\"Director of the Dead\\".    The movie takes place on Plum Island which I am assuming is a small island somewhere off the U.S. Coast and involves two feuding families, sort of like an Irish Hatfield and McCoys. Irish? And complete with brogues. I guess it's way off the U.S. Coast-like maybe closer to Ireland?     Anyhow both families have stubborn and knuckle-headed patriachs-the O'Flynns believe the only good zombie is a shot to the head zombie, while Papa Muldoon has a theory that if the zombies could be motivated to eat a living animal other than human-maybe that would save mankind. The theory does work but in a typical Romero ironic twist-the only person to witness the breakthrough is shot dead.    The movie is not boring, just a little tired and after awhile watching the back of a zombies head blow out after being shot grows old really fast and the exploding head by shotgun blast has been seen once too often.    Note to George A Romero--time to put the zombies to rest-or maybe a combination, say like, \\"The Living Dead Eat The Crazies\\" Ahhhh-maybe not.

B000V86OKG|4.0|The second season of Dexter, Showtime's crime drama about a Miami serial killer, explores new territory and continues to be very compelling and interesting, though perhaps not particularly realistic.  What follows assumes some familiarity with events in season one.  If you don't mind some major spoilers, from the first two seasons, free to continue.<br /><br />Dexter Morgan (Michael C. Hall) was traumatized as a child by seeing his mother murdered, and then chopped to pieces by a chainsaw.  He was adopted by Harry Morgan (James Remar), a cop who discovered the boy sitting a pool of his mother's blood.  When Harry discovered that Dexter had an abnormal desire to kill, he channeled those homicidal urges, so that Dexter would only take the lives of criminals who \\"deserved\\" to die.  Dexter, who is employed as a blood spatter expert for the Miami police, ceremoniously kills his victims, and then cuts up the bodies before disposing of them at sea.<br /><br />Season One concluded with the death of Dexter's brother Brian, who also had a similar propensity for homicide, and nearly murdered Dexter's sister Debra (Jennifer Carpenter).  Season Two picks up about a month later, where a traumatized Debra has moved into Dexter's apartment.  The stuff hits the fan, when the submerged remains of Dexter's many executions are discovered, and FBI agent Frank Lundy (Keith Carradine) is brought in to head a special task force investigating the \\"Bay Harbor Killer\\".<br /><br />Season Two finds Dexter Morgan off balance and under pressure, facing all kinds of crisis, with members of his own department closing in on him.  Dexter's relationship with his girlfriend Rita Bennett (Julie Benz) reaches a critical point, when Rita's ex-husband is killed in prison.  Believing that Dexter is a drug addict, Rita insists that he get into a treatment program, where Lila Tournay (Jaime Murray) becomes his sponsor.  She's an eccentric and totally unrealistic character, who is magnetically drawn to Dexter, and seems to have some insight into his dark nature.<br /><br />Dexter discovers more about the relationship between his mother and Harry, and the man who murdered his mother, but his biggest problem is Detective James Doakes (Erik King) who won't give up trying to discover what Dexter's secret is.  When he does, it creates a moral crisis that Dexter struggles to find an answer to.<br /><br />The dark brooding character from Season One becomes more \\"human\\" as Dexter becomes closer to Rita and her children.  With family matters placing more demands on his time, and his involvement with the psycho bitch that is Lila, Dexter has almost no time even try and save his own skin.  Torn between two women, he's losing control of his life and taking big risks, leaving a dead body unattended for days, and then Doakes a prisoner in a cage.<br /><br />It would be hard to top the twistedness of the \\"ice truck killer\\" from season one, but the writers come close, with the master manipulator Lila Tournay, and her warped possessive selfishness.  The reality factor isn't high, and some of the characters and storylines are starting to become predictable, but Dexter remains a very entertaining program, with skillful writing that somehow leads you to care about a murderer.  The acting remains top draw, as Michael C. Hall is pressed into bringing more to the role of Dexter than just a cold-hearted killer.  The whole cast is excellent, with Keith Carradine, Jaime Murray (Warehouse 13), and Erik King, perhaps shining a little brighter.  As with the first season, the most disappointing thing about the DVD set is the lack of substantial and topical bonus material.<br /><br />For most of the second season, Dexter is on the defensive trying to survive.  It's a tense and dangerous situation, that gets to be a strain after a while, that frankly isn't as much fun as the first season.  It's like Dexter is being drained of energy, and it's a real relief to see it come to a decisive close at the end.This sets the stage for Dexter to resume the offensive in Season Three, and get back to doing what he does best.  Break out the tape, plastic wrap, and knife set.he offensive in Season Three, and get back to doing what he does best.  Break out the tape, plastic wrap, and knife set.
0553805371|2.0|The pans on this website are fair.  The cosmic claims made are threadbare, lacking in evidentiary support.  Why are universes self-generating?  The authors don't meaningfully attempt to answer the question, which lies at the heart of their premise:  That we live in one of billions of universes, the one whose physical laws are capable of supporting matter and life.  But let's stipulate that this apparently speculative premise is nevertheless correct.  My theological question is, so what?  The authors concede readily that the likelihood of any one universe being able to support matter and life is exceedingly small -- because the laws of physics are so precisely fine-tuned.  From there, they leap to the conclusion that there is no need for a God to explain the existence of our universe, the one in which we happen to find ourselves, because, again, it is just one among billions of universes.  But what's theoretical bridge connecting these two principles?  I don't see it -- and I am a person whose faith is far from rock solid.  Can't someone respond to Hawking by saying, \\"You say we're lucky to live in our universe (because it's one of the few that can support life), but why can't that \\"luck\\" be something pre-ordained, or at least caused, by a creator, a God?  Someone who wins the lotto, beating the odds, might naturally attribute his good fortune to God's will.  Why me?  Why was I so lucky?  What force intervened to give me such a bounty?  Hawking's book does nothing to undermine this person's likely assumption that God played a significant role in his hitting the jackpot.
B0019NB9A2|5.0|The Movie:<br /><br />I don't know how I went for 33 years without seeing this movie. I am a big science fiction aficionado, and a massive Star Trek fan in particular. Perhaps I had subconsciously lumped this film in with other 50's-era schlock. Well, I was in error to do so.<br /><br />As a Trek fanatic, it was fascinating to see a film from 1956 which was so obviously a huge inspiration for Gene Roddenberry's original series. So many aspects of this film find their way into Roddenberry's TV show:<br />-a \\"United Earth\\" space vessel that travels faster than light<br />-a transporter-like deceleration chamber,<br />-the storyline of checking on a missing survey team<br />-an ancient civilization that had evolved to the point of non-corporeal being<br />-brain scanners which impart huge loads of information directly into the minds of the recipient<br /><br />These are but a few of the similarities, the most impressive of which might be the tonal similarity: the sense of seriousness and wonder at space exploration, mixed with just enough humor and sex appeal to keep things moving breezily.<br /><br />But more than just a preview for the Star Trek show that would emerge a decade later, we also get a good story with a fine emotional core, adapted very loosely from Shakespeare's \\"Tempest\\" - a reclusive scientist (like Shakespeare's wizard), living on a secluded world with only his daughter for company, who fears losing her to visitors from far away. I won't spoil the secret we eventually learn about this scientist, but suffice it to say, it is an excellent science fiction concept which is well-fleshed out.<br /><br />The performances are all good, and the actors clearly took the material seriously. Particularly good are Walter Pidgeon as Dr. Morbius, and Anne Francis as his daughter Alta. Leslie Nielsen cuts a fine figure as the square-jawed commander of the ship, too.<br /><br />The effects are also surprisingly good for a film of this day. Yes, we can tell with our modern eyes when optical effects, matte painted backdrops, and models are being used. But the level of execution in this definitely out-shines the original Star Trek TV series from a decade later, and was probably not surpassed in quality until Kubrick's \\"2001\\" in 1968. The set designs are also terrific, with extremely detailed props.<br /><br />Simply put, this is a seminal film, in the fullest possible sense of the word - it set an extremely high standard for the genre, and certainly gave birth to future greats like Star Trek. If you're a Trek fan, I consider this a must-own. If you're a student of the genre, this is equally necessary. But not only sci-fi nerds need apply - this is an interesting story with a lot of intelligence, but also a good amount of drama and heart. Just about anyone should be capable of being entertained by this - it's simply a good movie.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray:<br /><br />For a 54 year-old movie, this transfer is stunningly good. Warner Bros. has scored again with a classic film transfer. Detail is not as strong as some modern films, but there is a lovely sheen of film grain that never wavers. Colors and black levels are stable and strong throughout. And detail can be quite good at times. Certainly, no DVD could reach the levels of detail present here. Cloth textures can be quite lovely, and fine hair and facial wrinkle detail is evident. Alta's outfits are particularly nice to look at, with lots of fine cloth detail and sparkling jewels.<br /><br />What really impresses are the slate of extras, all included on one dual-layer Blu-Ray disc. We get a complete 90-minute second movie, the standard def, black and white film \\"The Invisible Boy,\\" featuring Robby the robot. A complete 25-minute episode of \\"The Thin Man\\" TV series is also included, featuring Robby. An hour-long (!) documentary from Turner Classic Movies delves into the culture of 50's sci-fi movies, with interviews of current sci-fi directors like Ridley Scott, George Lucas, Steven Spielberg, and James Cameron, and clips from dozens of contemporary 50's genre flicks. Then, we also get two featurettes, running 29 and 14 minutes respectively, looking at the production of the film and the construction of Robby the Robot. Some other vintage TV excerpts show Walter Pidgeon introducing Robbie to the home audience. 20 minutes of deleted scenes and \\"lost footage\\" rounds out a truly impressive collection of extras.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br /><br />I was impressed in every way imaginable by this release. The film stands up with classics like \\"The Day The Earth Stood Still\\" and \\"2001\\" as genre must-owns. The Blu-Ray itself displays a superb quality of video, delivering both as very good high-definition as well as an accurate, film-like presentation of a cinema classic. The extras are truly exceptional, way more comprehensive than the average catalog release.<br /><br />This is truly a stellar (heh, heh) release. I can't recommend it enough. I anticipate getting MANY viewings out of this title for years to come, and look forward to passing on this film classic to the next generation as well.pielberg, and James Cameron, and clips from dozens of contemporary 50's genre flicks.

0553805371|2.0|I was excited to read Hawking's new but but I have to say that I was thoroughly disappointed.  I loved The Universe in a Nutshell.  I also loved Mlodinow's The Drunkards Walk.  This book was supposed to explain M-Theory but it only alluded to it.  I can sum up this short book as the following: Anyone who believes in God is stupid, we don't need to invoke God to explain the origin of the universe, I'd love to explain M-theory to you but you are probably a bible believing christian who believes that God literally stopped the sun for Joshua to give him an extra day in battle so you probably wouldn't understand.  My primary interest is in biology and I don't know a lot about physics.  I'd love to learn but Hawking's and Mlodinow's condescending attitudes were no help.  Why the attitude?  I believe that the answer is simple.  Biology has a real scientific answer for the apparent design in nature.  As Robert Wright points out in his brilliant book The Evolution of God, Paley was not wrong when he made his argument from design.  He noticed that much like a watch has  a watchmaker, life must have had a designer.  It turns out that he was right.  Living organisms, unlike rocks or other minerals were designed and this design may even point to a higher purpose.  The designer was natural selection.  Natural selection explains the apparent design we see in the natural world.   The world of physics has no equivalent.  Hawking and Mlodinow present nothing equivalent to natural selection in their new book.  The only way they can explain our universe that is fine tuned for human life, is to appeal to the idea that 10 to the 500th power universes (all unobservable) must somehow exist and we find ourselves in this one because it is the only one in which beings like us could evolve.  This is an interesting idea, but it is just an idea.  I can't believe that they started the book with \\"Philosophy is dead\\" and then, instead of laying out the science, they philosophized about how the universe did not need a creator.  Maybe they are right, I don't know.  But, their question is not a scientific question but a philosophical one.  Natural selection explains the apparent design we see in life on earth.  But, from what I got from this book M-Theory does no such thing for the universe itself.  It doesn't matter how much Hawking and Mlodinow wish it were otherwise.
B001CXWWBE|5.0|I needed to replace a failed 1GB NIC and this one was at a good price and had favorable reviews so I bought one. Windows XP would only partially recognize the board but the supplied driver on the CD that came with the NIC installed with no problems.     No idea as to whether it works with Vista or Windows 7 so recommend checking other reviews if that is the OS poison you picked.    There are better NIC cards for servers but for a client PC it is fine and the price is right.
6304712499|5.0|Fantasy is one of my most favorite of all movies and this one is exciting and just plain fun.  The actors were excellent in their characters.  I watch this over and over which is why I've upgraded to this DVD from my old VHS.  The special effects are breathtaking.  I love this movie - If I buy a movie it's because, as far as I'm concerned, it's a five star movie and this is one of them...
B002N8A14M|4.0|I personally think this is one of the best running armbands for Ipod.  It looks great, the velocro band fits around my arm nicely, the controls are easy to access while running, and I really like that the Ipod can be quickly and easily removed from the armband.  The case is clear so I can easily see the colorful aluminum case of my Ipod (plain black).<br /><br />Another nice feature is the ability to attach the Ipod with the included belt clip rather than the armband.<br /><br />My case had arrived with one defect that many others have complained about in these reviews.  The clear plastic case has an opening in the bottom for access to the charger port and headphone jack.  Unfortunately there is a manufacturing defect and/or design defect with the opening.  It's not wide enough to accomodate the standard Apple Ipod headphone plug that comes with Nano, and it appears that many other models of headphones don't fit either.  The plug goes in deep enough to make a partial connection, with interrupted audio, but the narrow opening prevents the plug from fully seating into the jack by a few millimeters.  The simple solution; take a sharp pocket knife and shave off a bit of the plastic from the clear case where it interferes with the headphones.  It literally only took 5 seconds to do this and my headphones now work fine and you can't tell the case has been modified.  Voila.<br /><br />Hope that helps everyone.
B003ZSIS6C|5.0|When I started flipping through it last night, I saw a great list from Chris that I had seen somewhere before. The list originally appeared in his free manifesto entitled, A Brief Guide to World Domination'. (available on his website)<br /><br />Here's the list. (and I hope Chris doesn't mind me sharing it here)<br /><br />Eleven Ways to Be Unremarkably Average<br /><br />1. Accept what people tell you at face value<br />2. Don't question authority<br />3. Go to college because you're supposed to, not because you want to learn something<br />4. Go overseas once or twice in your life, to somewhere safe like England<br />5. Don't try to learn another language; everyone else will eventually learn English<br />6. Think about starting your own business, but never do it<br />7. Think about writing a book, but never do it<br />8, Get the largest mortgage you qualify for and spend 30 years paying for it<br />9. Sit at a desk 40 hours a week for an average of 10 hours of productive work<br />10. Don't stand out or draw attention to yourself<br />11. Jump through hoops. Check off boxes.'<br /><br />Chris's new book isn't for everyone, and that's OK. There is no shame in living an average life. That average - \\"the life-performance average\\" if you will,  could be a bit on the high side. But chances are we're on the low side of things. But hey, don't sweat it, it's only an average.<br /><br />If you're unremarkably average, Chris is going to push you to ask yourself some tough questions. He's going to push you to try something outside your comfort zone. Chris repeatedly gives you the opportunity, throughout the book, to back out. And many will back out. The 'average' will put it down, or send it back for a refund. The 'average' will smile and smirk as they read Chris's suggestions for a life of non-conformity. They'll say, \\"Yeah right Chris\\"<br /><br />Do you see yourself in this list? Do you care? Or is average and unremarkable good enough for you?<br /><br />Then again, maybe Chris's book is exactly what you're looking for.

B002PMPTIO|5.0|As a longtime fan I've watched the original series, many other series, and the sequence of movies. The original series had a certain bravado, a brashness, a ballsy celebration of life to it that, in my opinion, was slowly washed out of subsequent works due to political correctness and other influences. This movie brings cajones back to the franchise. The youthful excitement, abandon, and testosterone explodes on the screen. For much of the film the proverbial governor is removed pushing the envelope beyond suggested maximum warp speed. Watching this movie feels not just like watching Star Trek, but like being a kid again and watching the first series for the first time. Except for perhaps the most particular of purists, who will watch anyway, there is so much in this film for everyone whether they are new fans or old ones who want to see Star Trek once again as it was when the world was young.

B00004T9VY|5.0|I hadn't listened to this since probably 1977 or so, back when the vinyl record was all there was. On a whim I got the CD version from an Amazon affiliate reseller. (As a result I am not sure whether I got the remastered version from 2008 or an older one. I have just listened to it on the car system and it didn't sound very bright in the high frequencies...)    If it's been \\"too long\\" since you heard this front-to-back, I think you should do yourself a favor. Revel in songs with actual melodies and whose lyrics are about something.    The songs I remembered as favorites sound great, and there are a couple gems in there that I hadn't noticed the first time around, these 33 years since; I think the Tea For The Tillerman album has aged better than I have. :-)    Many of the reviewers have already covered the songs and their meaning beautifully. I'm just sorry I waited so long to rediscover this.

This movie was worse than Godfather III, Ghostbusters II or even the new Star Wars trilogy.  This film made me want to roll up in a little ball and cry myself to death. I have never felt a film could be so terrible and even insulting before. This movie changed my outlook on going to movies simply to get out and watch a movie with a tub of popcorn. I can't DO THAT ANYMORE. I am so traumatized by XIII that I have to read RottenTomatoes and Flixter and ask multiple people who've watched it bc I don't ever want to be conned again.

B00319ECC4|5.0|Well, in recent years, when I heard a new Fear Factory was coming out, I was mostly 'meh, it'll be like the last one' which after 'Obsolete' I didn't find their releases to be that great, exclude 'Archetype' because I thought that one was pretty good, but is this one better?    YES, I was completely shocked when I bought this and popped it into my CD player, I was hit with rage and aggression which FF have lacked for years in my opinion, for me, this is on par with the great 'Demanufacture' as far fetched as that sounds, it's the truth, it's very similar to said album, but it's not a carbon copy.    Now I was unaware that longtime drummer 'Raymond Herrara' was gone, and when I got the CD, and looked in the booklet, I had to make sure my eyes weren't playing tricks on me, I saw the name Gene 'The Machine' Hoglan next to the drum credits, I was shocked, even before I heard the music, I knew he would be aggression, just look at the bands he's been with (Dark Angel, Testament, Death) if that isn't enough proof, I don't know what is.    This album is the best they've done easily since 1995's 'Demanufacture' and can be compared to it, and like I said, I liked 'Obsolete' and 'Archetype' but this monster here mops the floor with those releases, so if you are a fan of old FF, don't be afraid to check this out, Digimortal it is not!
1576754227|4.0|I learned few new things from this book.     Most important thing to remeber is that every day first you have to do the most important obligations that day.  And this is true. We do the easiest things first and hardest leave for latter, and this is wrong.  We have to deal with important obligations first and less important we can do if we have time.    Everything you have to do following day, write on paper and rank them by importance and consequence (must be done or you can postpone it).      At the end of the book writter is starting to repeating things (on 100 small pages).  Also writter is focused just on time managment so in one part of the book he wrote that we don't  loose time on talking with our colleagues, but  we have to focused on our obligations. Hardcore time managment without social interaction.    This was the first book about Time Managment which I read, and I think it is a good start point.    Greetings from Croatia
B0012GVKW8|4.0|I have read many reviews on Predator and The Terminator BluRay disc. Everyone complains about the picture quality of both films, expecting more than they should from these movies. I remember seeing these films for the first time in theaters and the grain of the picture which  seems to be the most complained part of the dvds. These movies were grainy in their original theatrical run, whether it was a technical problem with the filming of these movies or added by the studio for some kind of mood setting, who knows. Either way, they are better in color and sharpness on Blu Ray than standard dvd. Believe me, I have a 12 foot projection screen and use a high definition projector and Blu Ray player, so I do see the difference. If you are looking for a bargain, go to your local Walmart and pickup the 2  dvd Blu Ray pack of Predator and The Terminator for $20.

B00364K6YW|5.0|This is definately a gazillion times better than any other movie version and the book.  I felt the characterss were perfectly done; you had to like the good ones (Elisabeth, Mr. Darby), and hate the others intensely      (Mr. Wickham, Mr. Darby's aunt, his two ?itches sisters, and the Reverend Mr. Collins).  I slept thru the book in high school but this version is so good, it has to be seen over and over and over again.  It is that good.  It may be long but worth the time.
0545265355|5.0|I have read all the other reviews and I agree that these books are very good, keeping you on the edge of your seat, up late at night etc etc.  The only problem is they are not for young readers in my opinion.  Here are some of the main topics of the book:    The title gives it away - a gladiator like arena where 24 young people are forced to fight to the death.  Torture and brainwashing with hallucinogenic drugs (tracker jacker venom).  A ruthless dictator who uses the games as a way to suppress the population and then PIMPS OUT the winners.  Fire bombing an entire city and killing thousands.  Traps devised in the games to kill people that reminded me of the one and only SAW movie I went to see.  Just a lot of death and the author does not shy away from describing it... blood and flying body parts...  The main character describes her nightmares and how she loses her grip on reality from time to time because of what happens around her.  Also about how she uses drugs to cope (morphling).    Just because the books' main character is a 16 year old girl does NOT mean that these books are for young teens.  My 13 year old son read it before I did (shame on me) and I now wish he didn't.

014241493X|2.0|I had to push myself to finish reading this book, not because it was a page turner but because a friend recommended it to me and I don't like to let a friend down. However I had several problems with this book. They will be listed from the mildly annoying to the serious issues.    1. In what high school does a senior really care about translating Ovid? It must be some uber-rich suburban student who actually spends his evenings practicing Latin. On that note, what high school senior English teacher starts the class reading Moby Dick a month before graduation?     2. Real 18 year olds do not speak like any of the 18 year olds in this book. Radar was a nice character but Ben and his \\"honeybunny...I have the biggest balls...YESSSS!!!!!!!\\" was my least favorite fictional character ever created (since Jar Jar Binks) from the first page of his introduction. If I knew people in real life who talked or acted like Ben I would avoid them at all costs. Unfortunately he tags along for most of the story, including the road trip at the end. Being trapped in a car with these characters for over 1000 miles was the car trip from hell.     3. I liked Margo's character, I really did. There were parts of the book where the lines made me laugh out loud. But I find it interesting that Q could get mad at Ben's self-absorbed personality (which he was) while overlooking Margo's and even his own. Talk about mirrors and windows.    4. Finally, enough with the metaphors. I think that John Green is in love with his own brain. Q, Margo, the police officer who rants about balloons, even the English teacher are not treated as characters but as extensions of Green's own idealism. From the balloon rant, to the paper towns rant to the \\"Is Ahab insane or heroic?\\" to any of Q's deep thinking sessions --- all of it is entirely the same voice. Yes I understand what your message is Mr. Green but could you let the characters be themselves and not you. I don't need to hear the same message repeated on everypage by almost every character to get it.     5. Finally, having never read Leaves of Grass by Whitman, when it was first mentioned in the story I made a mental note to read Song of Myself later as it sounded interesting. Now I don't have to. I have all of Green's opinions on what the poem means and symbolizes to tell me what to think.     In short, thank you John Green for this coming-of-age tale much like your other coming-of-age tales. Ordinary boy meets legendary, angst filled girl, falls in love but never speaks up, follows her around like a puppy, loses her in the end while entertaining us with deeply poignant observations on the typical life of the American teenager.
B0014KA0EG|5.0|Haunting harmonies, classic riffs, beautiful melodies and all the anger needed to make this a true classic. Lifting from many experiences in life, this CD captures the anger and torment of a drug abused individual. The emotions in these songs are undeniable, from Down in a Hole to , Rain when I die to Junkhead. This is a chronicle of a downward spiral life. Do I approve of the messages, no. Do I think this is a snapshot of an individual and art at it's finest....you better believe it. From my generation, this is quite possibly our Led Zeppelin IV or our Beatles White Album. A relentless anger ridden ride that leaves you only wanting more. I would give this CD 10 stars if at all possible.
B002ZG98UK|5.0|I have RE (thanks to an earlier writer for this Abbrev) 1, 2, and 3, this number 4 is all that I expected it to be! Milla looks lovely and hot as hell as does all the other Milla's in the beginning battle! Ali Larter, the same! Although in RE3 Milla and Ali looked as though they just keep having the Revlon Make-up person \\"re-make\\" them all the time even thru all the grueling battle scenes! I'm good with that-----I'm a fan of this series and I was totally entertained with this, now in 3D! There is a good thing for all RE fans at the end of this movie-----! Excellent and Fun!
B003HYNB34|5.0|I don't watch much televison past a daily news show and care little for following a series except one ... this one.  I don't know why, but 'Doctor' Tom Baker drew me into it with what has become a decades long intrigue in this series through David Tennant's endearing portrayals.  There's something about Doctor Who that is just plain fun for this Yank.<br /><br />This episode starts Season 5 under the reigns of Steven Moffat and a new Doctor.  Unless one had the 'spoilers', ep-1 left many fans a bit confused about the direction it would take and, therefore, concerns about how Matt Smith as The Doctor would fare.  All those worries evaporated with the episode 12 and 13 finales, which I count as among the two best ever episodes.  I firmly decided that Steven Moffat is an evil genius.  He has manipulated me into actually buying a TV episode, which I NEVER do, on the suspicion that episode 1 is peppered with a zillion clues to Moffat's madness.  Sure enough, it is.<br /><br />It took special actors to carry this off.  Matt, Karen, Arthur, Alex ... you are off-the-plot terrific.  Thank you for your good work!  New episodes return in December 2010 and a very special Xmas present, indeed!

One this is done recording is a one button action, but you must manually enter in the title, album and artist for each song.  I cannot figure out how to connect this to Grace-note automatically but Itunes may do this for you if it is imported to that library.

0439023513|1.0|SPOILERS  Loved the first two books and was highly recommending people to read the series. . .until I read Mockingjay.  Here are my reasons I didn't enjoy this book.    1.  I felt like I was reading book written by an amateur instead of a seasoned author.  Connections with the characters weren't built.  The storyline was slow, super slow in the beginning.  Parts in the book were put together by say oh yeah so and so died or so and so lived and took a different job.  Connections with characters was very difficult and fell flat.  You felt no real loss or hope for many of the main characters. The end of the book was so rushed it was poorly done.    2.  Previous characters that had been built up in the the earlier books had complete reversals of personalities.  Collins spent so much time in the earlier books building up Katniss to be a strong, vibrant, always plodding and planning,doing what she had to but not for the glory type of girl.  Mockingjay she mopes, and does exactly what she is told, not really in the center of anything.  This doesn't fit Katniss' personality that was previously built.      3.  I am a sucker for building up love interest, the romantic part of things, which was cleverly done so well in the first two books.  The dynamic was great in the first two.  Once again, a huge disappointment in Mockingjay.  Gale spends little time with Katniss, for someone who is so interested in her he hardly ever sees her.  Long periods of time go on without any interaction, and then oh yeah they saw each other in the basement.  DUMB!!!  Not to mention Gale as her best friend completely abandons her at the end.  Doesn't try to see her, doesn't try to help her, and then she never sees or hears from him again!?!?  Some friend, not very realistic in my opinion.  Peeta on the other hand, the whole highjacking was overplayed and drawn out too long.  By the time they ended up together at the end I felt no excitement or enjoyment for them.   Speaking of getting together at the end.  It was poorly executed, poorly written, and once again lacked any real attachment to the characters.    4.  I have heard and read that it was suppose to be a realistic point of view of what it would have been like.  Well Collins must have a very negative, pessimistic point of view on life then.  No hope, no happiness, no love and connection with those who mean the most to you in your deepest and darkest moments instead you are abandoned, no belief in improvement in government or being able to govern ones own life, what a negative view on life.      After reading this book I can't recommend the series any longer to friends and family.  I would now be embarrassed for someone to read the series off my recommendation because I know how lousy the last book is.  I want a rewrite of the last book, I want the last book to have the same drive and pace as the first book, and I want to feel hope in the book.
0060512806|1.0|My first Stephenson book, and maybe my last. I was interested to read other reviews that indicated that this book was not reflective of his talent. I certainly hope not.<br /><br />The book was overwritten and boring. At page 434, I had invested some time but I just could not care what happens to these boring people in their mechanical lives. Where's the story, I kept on thinking to myself, this will get better, there is so much potential here. I can't help but feel that if he edited the book down to 434 pages, it could have been a great story.
B001BPJJ9G|5.0|I love this movie, and was shocked to be able to find such a reasonably-priced DVD.  I am very happy with this purchase.
B0001CCXZW|5.0|I was so excited to find this product for sale on Amazon.  I had purchased the other seasons for my daughter for Christmas...but sadly Season 1 was not available at any store that I looked in.  I should have known to check Amazon! We got the Gilmore Girls Complete First Season in great shape in the original box and started watching the Gilmore Girls all over again!  My daughter (16 yr old) and I make popcorn and dump in a few peanut M&M's and have girl time and it is time well spent!

B001UV4XWY|3.0|The Box is based on a short story written by Richard Matheson, who also wrote many classic episodes of The Twilight Zone. Richard Kelley rewrote the short story and directed this rather confusing sci-fi flick. Kelley is the mastermind behind Donnie Darko, if you didn't enjoy that film - you probably won't like this then. The first hour is really good but the last hour, is just plain creepy. James Marsden feels out of place in this film but who really steals the show is Cameron Diaz. Diaz has always been a hit and miss for me, I thought she was brilliant in the chick-flick In Her Shoes. You wouldn't think Diaz could pull off such a meaty performance but she does and Frank Langella is also wonderful. The Box is just one of those films that doesn't make sense, it's eye-catching but not good enough to keep a viewer's interest for too long, what a shame!
B00406UK7S|5.0|This is a combination of Gladiator and 300.  Seven Roman soldiers must make their way back to Hadrian's Wall after their legion (IX) is wiped out by the Scottish Picts.  The problem is that a Pict war-party is hot on their trail after the legionnaires assassinated the Pict Chieftain's infant boy.      If you like 300, Gladiator, The Fall of the Roman Empire or even the Spartacus mini-series and can overlook the plot, you'll love Centurion because there is plenty of blood and guts to fill two hours of celluloid.  This film is an ancient slaughter house.

B001W79MB8|5.0|For serious anime fans, it's hard to find an action/adventure that tops the original Ninja Scroll anime for superb fights and choreography.  There have been many attempts, but none quite like that original.<br /><br />Unfortunately/Fortunately depending on how you look at it, Sword of the Stranger doesn't top Kawajiri's masterpiece, but in terms of great mixture of story and pulse pounding action set pieces, this film is a winner.  This anime is well worth adding to your collection, anime fan or not.
006145205X|5.0|I really enjoyed this one.  There's not a lot I can add to the good reviews already here.  This book pulls together the evidence that humans have been on a steady path toward a better life for as long as we've been humans.  There is every reason to believe that we will continue along that path.    Unfortunately, to be taken seriously, it is expected that one accept the prophesies of doom offered by those who tell us that science and progress are dooming us.  \\"We are overpopulating ourselves to extinction,\\" warn the sober and serious voices of the \\"responsible\\" leaders.    This book helps me understand why we aren't really overpopulated, we're actually underpopulated.      Some will see this book as support for their political views.  In my view, it is neither conservative nor liberal. It's just a logical analysis and good news for the human race.
0810995212|5.0|Norman Rockwell is a household name to many Americans, and just as many non-US born enthusiasts, but as those very same Americans who J.C Leyendecker is and they'll likely draw a blank.<br /><br />He's in my opinion just as big a perpetuator of the American ideal as Rockwell ever was and this book is such a great collection of his art. A fan of either should not miss out on this.<br /><br />I really hate \\"art books\\" that when you flip through their pages, they have more words than images.  Quite happily this is not one of those.  Words are unavoidable as I'm sure those not familiar with the artist will probably want to know just a little about them, but ultimately I think most people pick up these books for the art. This book has that in spades.  Even the table of contents and bibliographies are lined with his art.  Love, love, love this book.
B000JLTRKE|5.0|Yesterday, on the 9th anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, we watched Oliver Stone's \\"World Trade Center\\". It is a terrific film (third time I've seen it) and captures the tragedy very well. Four superb acting performances make this a 5 star gem. They are Nicolas Cage, Michael Pena, Maggie Gyllenhaal and Maria Bello. It is a very emotional film and brings back those horrible memories of that fateful day. But it also captures the bravery and heroism of the police, firefighters and volunteers. The \\"World Trade Center\\" will definitely send chills down your spine and will bring tears to your eyes. While it may unveil as a very depressing film, it is so invigorating at the end and makes you proud to be an American. Give it a try...but don't be afraid to turn it off if it's too intense.  You won't be disappointed.  Oliver Stone has never disappointed me.

0553805371|3.0|I am a layman and don't know a lot about physics....however, the subject of the existence of the universe (the hows and whys) is very intriguing and captivates me (like everyone else).....    The Grand Design seems to be targeted to laymen like myself as I think it does not offer enough detailed explanation / discussion of complicated theories for the pure scientific community....Therefore, I think that although a person with no / little knowledge of physics is not going to be in a position to critique the ideas and form his own conclusion...however, he is supposed to simply take the book at face value which is that since it has been co-written by Stephen Hawking it has got to be right scientifically....    Having said that, after finishing the book I did not feel convinced of the book's conclusions....the main points that I could not understand (I am talking only from a logical perspective because I couldn't understand most of the physics in the book anyways) are:    1) The book appears to conclude that there are 10(to the power 500) universes (with possibly different laws of nature for each) which would have sprung out of nothing...and we happen to be living in one of them because it is possible that at least one out of the total of these universes (which is a really big number) would have just the right conditions for life to develop in the form it has.....So, effectively, to me, the book is saying that we only exist because anything and everything is possible....     2) The book does not define what exactly is 'nothing'...I have personally found it to be the most important missing information...I might be completely wrong (naive) over here as I am no physicist...however, I would say that generally when we say nothing in normal usage we mean something being non-existent (but visually the image of space/ vacuum comes to mind)...however, I think this is not going to be the case with this 'nothing' in physics, as vacuum (space) is also something...my point is how dowe know what exactly is 'nothing' to claim  'something' coming into existence spontaneously...    3) With respect to the cause of creation of 'something' out of 'nothing' , the book appears to state that it is gravity that can and will create something out of nothing.....Well I do not understand this...firstly what does that make of gravity?...isn't gravity something itself?...or are we saying that gravity is the eternal / fixed thing responsible for creation...secondly, is gravity not the effect of bodies (mass) attracting each other?...so in the absence of mass ('something') how could gravity exist?......thirdly, is gravity not one of the laws of nature of this universe...which could mean that it may not be independent of this universe and may not exist in trillions and trillions of other multiverses...so, then how come gravity becomes a fundamental source of creation when it is a function of our universe?..    To be honest, for a common person like myself, this book only makes for an interesting reading as it gives us some insights (at a high level) into what is happening at the front of theoretical physics currently....and for this, I have given the book a 3 star....    As to the accuracy / plausibility of the conclusions, I am very interested in knowing what do the rest of the physicists (independent of Mr. Hawking and his co-writer) think? As it is their view that is going to count the most if Mr. Hawking's conclusions are going to be accepted scientifically in the course of history (whatever that may be).
B002ZG97E2|5.0|Rest assured if you enjoy laughter and a heartwarming tale this is your film. It's not a deeply philosophical story and may be called simple by some, but what it attempts to do it does well through the use of cleverly written characters, stylized visuals, and a great soundtrack.    The story: May not be the most original premise in the world but is presented in a very fluid manner with original and funny jokes aimed at adults and kids alike. The ending may or may not make you cry happily but odds are to the former no matter whether you're single, married, with kids, or a kid yourself. It's a story that touches anyone with parents. The characters all seemed to posses traits which viewers can identify with someone in their lives, which is very difficult to do and shows good writing (Notable use of a great portrayal of a single dad family).     The Visuals: Stylized and beautiful. The characters all have pronounced physical character, none are the stereotypical \\"beautiful\\" person yet even with their pronounced cartoonish traits they all seem very real to the viewer as believable characters with real lives, almost like caricatures of real people left over from a carnival in any random state.  Items in the movie do seem to have well-rendered visual textures, and the style of them follows the style of the people. I never noticed any horrible mistakes, everything looked wonderful.     Sound: Pharrel contributes some wonderful songs to the soundtrack that serve to show that children's movies don't have to rely entirely on recycled tunes. They are both fun and very modern sounding. In addition, the movie doe utilize a Bee Gee's disco hit: You Should Be Dancing, and the classic Boogie Fever by the Sylvers. They add the needed back beat to a couple of dance scenes that you will either love or hate, depending on your tastes. :)    The negatives and conclusion: The complaints are few. Some say the story leans too much to the main character Gru's plot, and not enough to his laterinteractions with the girls. Some complained that use of obvious 3D tricks was so prevalent that it detracted from the plot. I personally didn't think that either of these was a major issue, this movie isn't supposed to be perfect, it's supposed to entertain and touch you emotionally and I felt that it accomplished this well. Just go in expecting a fun time and you'll most likely enjoy yourself. :)

0786956291|4.0|This new presentation of the renowned classic RPG was designed to appeal to old school gamers who did the boxed set & ADnD back in the day, like me. I hoped it would be a good way to introduce the hobby to my children, and those hopes were well-founded. The kids are having a blast. It's a fabulous starting point for D&D 4th Edition.<br /><br />BTW, 4E is vastly different from any previous version, barely recognizable compared to 1E. I think that the changes are for the better, but YMMV.<br /><br />My main gripe with Red Box is that it very carefully fails to include any straightforward listing of class features, weapon & armor stats, prices, etc. For example, my son wanted to use a bow, but it wasn't an option in the book. I ended up just winging it. There's really no way to use this box alone and run a proper campaign for 2 or 3 levels, the way that the original box set could do. This is a starter set, and ONLY a starter set. If you want to continue, WotC expects you to buy the (more expensive) followup books.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|\\"The Big Bang Theory\\" is the greatest television series since \\"The Dick Van Dyke Show.\\"  My son (who IS a science nerd) told me how great this show was during the first season, and I have been hooked from the very first episode I watched.  This show is, without a doubt, the highlight of my television viewing each week.  All of the characters are so intelligently developed and the characters always stay true to themselves.  Season three has been the best so far. In this age of mediocrity, it is a tribute to the writers how this program keeps its freshness and comedy alive.  My favorite season 3 moment was Sheldon's acceptance speech for a prestigious physics award.  Taking a page from Raj's playbook, Sheldon conquered his stagefright by becoming inebriated, albeit inadvertently.  I loved his joke about the chicken and the mobius strip.  It was a riot, even though I later had to have a friend explain to me why it was funny. Okay, so I never took calculus!!!  Even if you don't know the first thing about science or calculus or comic strip characters (a topic that is often visited), you will love \\"The Big Bang Theory\\" for the excellent acting from a great ensemble cast and its superior writing.  Definitely a \\"must see\\", and this DVD is a \\"must have.\\"

B003CFBQBW|5.0|When I first bought this cd, I thought, \\"This isn't nearly as good as the NEW MOON soundtrack.\\" However, after listening it a couple more times, I would say this is my favorite Twilight soundtrack yet, even though they are all very good. Twilight's soundtrack was very upbeat, New Moon's was very slow and mellow. Eclipse's soundtrack has a good mixture of different types of music that evoke different feelings and emotions. The best tracks is defenitely FLORENCE + THE MACHINE \\"Heavy in your arms\\", followed closely by Metric's I'm All Yours\\" and BECK + BAT FOR LASHES \\"Let's get lost\\". The Black keys and The Dead Weather's songs are also very good. Jacob's theme is the last track and is absolutely beautiful(just like Jacob himself). BUY IT!!!! Team Jacob!!!!

055358894X|4.0|If you are a child, poor and in the underclass in Camorr, there is not much you can do to change your circumstances. Well, unless you are damn good at lying, thieving and mummery. And Locke Lamora is very very good at all of them.<br /><br />Camorr, with a lot of parallels to Venice, is run by either gangs, or by the upper class, or perhaps by both, working in congress.<br /><br />Locke, orphaned and alone, is recruited into one notorius gang, but is so much trouble he's passed on to a somewhat more sophisticated level of thievery and cons. There, his exploits gain him some not necessarily great attention. He  becomes \\"The Thorn of Camorr and that's where things begin to go pear-shaped. Who is out to get him and his the rest of his gang, 'the Gentleman Bastards' and why?<br /><br />Good pacing, good writing and engaging characters you really want to root for.

B002N5N5M0|2.0|It took half the season to finally get interesting and the season finale... I wish I hadn't watched.  I've been a really big fan of the Dexter series and have been recommending it to friends and family for years, but this season was a total disappointment.  If you like Dexter, do yourself a favor and watch the first three seasons over again (well worth the time) but skip season 4.
B001KR0BDI|5.0|I thought it was a great book. I just grabbed it off of the shelves in the library and read it. It was an amazing book! I was looking for the next book and read it too. Kristin Cashore is a great author.  I just love her books!
0553805371|4.0|Bought the book yesterday. Finished it today. I skimmed a few of the reviews here, and i think it becomes obvious that the vast majority of those writting reviews did not actually read the book, and are just spewing opinions here based on their preconceived notions of this book, and how it jives with their own world-view. Come on people, write your reviews AFTER reading the book. Do you really have nothing better to do than to state opinions regarding publications you've never read??    Having said that, i can say that the book is logically sound, and it accomplished what it intends to. The book does NOT claim to disprove a creater, nor does it indend to act as an authoritative working, telling people what do believe. The purpose of the book is to show that, based on our current understanding of the laws of physics, the evolution of a universe such as ours can be completely explained by physical law. And this claim is true. It just is.     The book does not state that those who believe in a god are wrong. It simply states that to date, there is no evidence that they are right. The more we explore physical laws, the greater understanding we gain of the universe, and the less room there is for myth.     The book is fairly short, making it more accessable to a greater number of people. (many popular science readers do not want to tackle a 5 or 6 hundred page monster). The writing style flows well, is understandable and usually non-technical. It was somewhat more opinionated than Hawking's earlier books. Over-all, a nice read. Sound. Succinct. Valid.
B003U6BE8I|2.0|We loved the Percy Jackson books and hoped the movie would remain somewhat true to them.   Not the case here.  I don't mind when movies of books take some liberties to make time constraints, but the version did not share much in common with the books other than title, some character names, and a general theme of the plot.    It was a beautiful Chris Colombus production with nice visuals, but the butchering on the story when it was adapted to a screenplay ruined it for me.  Maybe if you had never read the books this movie may have been marginally acceptable.    Kiddies, don't try to use this movie as an easy out to doing a book report on the book.  You will fail.
0061743526|5.0|It was nice to use the 50th anniversary as an excuse to read again a great American classic.
0553805371|3.0|This is one of the prettiest books that has come across my desk in a long time: well-bound, slick paper, gorgeous pictures.  All in all, it is an excellent example of the book-maker's art.  Unfortunately, the actual text is so slight that I was disappointed from cover to index.<br /><br />My first disappointment was right on the cover.  I understand that Stephen Hawking is a world famous scientist (and one whom I admire) but was he the primary writer of the text?  I hope so, because why else does Leonard Mlodinow have his name in one-third the font size?  Mlodinow's book on geometry (Euclid's Window) is a truly great book while Hawking's books, though interesting, are not nearly as well written.  I understand that this likely has much to do with marketing but I'm always put off by \\"ghostwriting.\\"<br /><br />Then there's the fact that we're being fooled into thinking this is a full-sized hardcover when, in fact, at normal font size and spacing, this book would be a third of its size.  Essentially, it is nothing more than a longish essay.  As a teacher, I couldn't help but be reminded of students who play around with font size, spacing, and picture inserts to try to appear to reach the required length of an assignment.  Disappointing.<br /><br />Most importantly, however, is the fact that the argument these two highly intelligent men are trying to make is simply unconvincing.  Joining the ranks of scientists out to convince everyone that there is no need for god, they are arguing that \\"M-theory is the only candidate for a complete theory of the universe\\" which means (among other things) that there are multiple universes that can spontaneously generate from nothing.  Beyond that fact that I'm always cautious when any scientist proclaims absolutes and predicts the end of science, as this has happened as often as pastors predicting the end of the world with the same result, there's not enough depth to their development here to make their sweeping conclusions plausible.<br /><br />In fact, I couldn't help feeling that this was something of an exercise in ego.  That Hawking, in particular, is relying on the power of his fame to be convincing rather than the power of his argument.  This book simply isn't detailed enough to be a fully-formed argument.  I have a degree in physics, know its history, am familiar with Feynman's work, and understand the basics of string theory, but I couldn't see how someone without this kind of background would be able to follow much of this.  I don't feel I came away with a clear view of what they were trying to say.<br /><br />Still, they deserve credit for promoting their atheism without being strident or condescending to believers, and there are some interesting things here.  I like some of the history, particularly in the early parts of the book.  I like the hints at the difference between model-independent and model-dependent theories, though I thought they could have made more of this.  I like the description of the \\"Game of Life\\" and what it might mean for the development of a \\"universe\\" based on a set of simple rules, though this seems to contradict the main assertion of the book, that an entire sequence of complicated theories is necessary to describe the universe.<br /><br />In the end, however, it suffers from the same problem as many books of this type.  In its most important conclusions, it is all speculation masquerading as certainty.  I don't mind speculation, and Hawking and Mlodinow may turn out to be perfectly correct in many or all of their conclusions.  But I think the door is a long way from being closed on the debate here, and this book didn't bring me any closer to being convinced.lp feeling that this was something of an exercise in ego.

B0019N8P2W|5.0|I have been waiting years for a complete Daria dvd set. I was so into this show back when it aired and I was in middle school. It was so cool and grownup from a teenagers point of view. I am really annoyed and sad by the lack of the original music as that was a big part of the show and the time period back then. Oh well at least now I can see the episodes I missed when it was on tv.

1597801585|5.0|A brilliant \\"biopunk\\" novel set in Thailand, in the post-petroleum age where genetic engineering has unleashed plagues on crops and people alike, and Thailand maintains its independence by preserving its sacred heritage seedbanks, untouched by Western \\"calorie companies.\\"<br /><br />The main characters are Anderson Lake, an undercover \\"calorie man\\" (which makes him a bad guy, basically, though he does have his occasional redeeming moments), and Emiko, the Windup Girl, a genetically-engineered \\"new person.\\" However, there are several other POV characters in the book.<br /><br />This is a pretty glum view of the future, and some of the technological changes struck me as unlikely, but for the most part, it was a convincing dystopia. The only problem was that none of the characters were entirely sympathetic (except Emiko, who was flat, personality-wise), and with the shifting POVs in each chapter, it's hard to get engaged with any of them. Only towards the end do all their separate storylines come together.<br /><br />Nonetheless, I highly recommend it. This is one of the best new SF books I've read in years.
B001UG56ES|5.0|This movie starts off a little silly but soon picks up speed, turns serious, and delivers the viewer a good movie experience.  There is an epic style plot, lots of action, and really hot chemistry between Kidman and Jackson.  After a tough fight, the good guys win and gets the girl.  It's just my kind of film.
0439023513|5.0|This is the best YA series since Harry Potter, and Collins delivers an ending and an epilogue better than Rowling did. She actually managed to surprise me with a couple of twists, and more importantly, she made me keep turning pages because I cared what was going to happen next.<br /><br />Okay, it's still YA so the story is not as complex as you'd expect from an adult SF novel, and there were a few plot devices that made me grimace a little, but overall, this was a satisfying read with genuine resolution in the climax.
B00005NG9Z|5.0|If you're an Alice in Chains fan, please do youself a favor and buy this DVD.  Not only are all their most popular hits included but the DVD has actual footage of the band members themselves.  It is a treasure, as there is not much media to commemorate Layne Staley. I wish someone would do a life story or Biography.

B000063147|3.0|I'm a huge Avenged Sevenfold fan. I had every CD from Waking The Fallen all the way to Nightmare. All amazing albums. I always heard this album was much heavier so I've always wanted to check it out. To be honest, it's a little hard to listen to at times. There's really A LOT of screaming. I started listening the band after waking the fallen came out so I knew what to expect. It's just different hearing A7X like this after they evolved into this new arena metal band. Don't get me wrong, I find their newer material far more superb than the older stuff. Still it's cool to see where this band came from and if your a fan of the band (or metalcore/screaming at all) then it's really worth giving it a listen.
B002UXRGLG|5.0|We love David Attenborough and all his documentaries, but only hear his narration throughout this series. The cinematography is amazing and you will enjoy watching it and learning something about life that you never knew existed! They even provide a short \\"Making of\\" section after each episode explaining how they were able to get those amazing images on film in the first place. Its educational, exciting and something the whole family will enjoy watching together.
1449536689|5.0|Mysteries/suspense are my favorite reads. I have only just heard of this book. Wow. The writing is superb. If you like mysteries, get this!!
0061922315|3.0|I agree with the reviewer who wrote \\"Good Plot, Weak Characters.\\"  The idea of following two families who do not know they are connected, one who places a child for adoption because she is a girl, and one who lives halfway around the world who adopts the girl, is wonderful.  Ann Hood did this to some extent in \\"The Red Thread,\\" but she did not follow the Chinese mothers for the rest of their lives, as Shilpa Gowda follows Kavita.  Kavita is married to Jasu, who had their first-born daughter killed.  They can only afford one child, and he will do anything for a son.  When Kavita produces yet another girl child, she runs away from her small village to an orphanage in Mumbai, to leave the wrong-gendered infant and spare her the fate of her older sister.  Meanwhile, we meet Somer (American, Caucasian, Protestant) and Krishnan (Indian, Hindu), a young married couple living in California whose efforts to give birth have produced nothing but grief.  They travel to India to adopt the little girl that Kavita placed in the orphanage, whom they call Asha (Hope).<br /><br />(What comes below talks about more of the plot than you may want to know if you plan to read the book.)<br /><br />It is not clear what attracts Somer and Krishnan to each other in the first place; perhaps Somer is drawn in by the exotic, foreign Krishnan, so different than anything else in her otherwise plain vanilla life.  Somer has little if any interest in Krishnan's culture, so unless Krishnan is trying to escape all memories of India (and there is nothing that indicates this), it is hard to see what attracts him to Somer (yes she is bright and attractive, but can someone really love another person who has no interest in his native land/culture?).  The adoption and raising of Asha hold this couple together, but when Asha leaves the nest for college and a fellowship in India, the cracks in the marriage show all too clearly.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Kavita gives birth to the long-dreamed of son, Vijoy (Victory).  The family's move from village to city (Mumbai, naturally) proves economically sound, but plays havoc with the traditional family bonds, as Vijoy is influenced more by friends than family, and grows up to be a drug dealer.  Why his parents take his ill-gotten money when they know what he is doing is not clear to me, as Kavita is portrayed as a long-suffering saint and Jasu slowly reveals that, despite having his first child killed, he has (almost) a heart of gold.<br /><br />Growing up, Asha has shown some curiousity about her birth family and birth culture  This section of the book needs considerably more substance if we are to believe that Asha travels to India to stay with her father's relatives whom she does not know and winds up wholeheartedly embracing the family (and vica versa) and the culture, and of course, finding love (while writing prize-winning articles to boot).  She also searches for her birth family, which is totally believable, but the resolution is wishy-washy.<br /><br />One gaping omission is the role of the caste system in the life of Indian society.  Does caste really play NO role in this story?  How can that possibly be?  Why is it never mentioned when it is so important in Hindu India?  Would all of Krishnan's family truly embrace this adopted child, most likely from a lower caste than they?  Would Asha really be given such an honored role at her grandfather's funeral?  Is the author saying that caste is meaningless in India, or does she just wish that were true?<br /><br />This could have been a very compelling story about cross-cultural and transracial adoption if it had examined more thoroughly and realistically each member of the adoption triad and the cultures that they came from.

0739384171|5.0|The main (female) character , Lisabeth Slander, in this book was intriging to me although I suspect many readers may not have been able to diagnose how or why she was so unique since they are not familiar with this.  I suggest when the reader learns this factor, tO look it up so you will further understand how well this was written and it would make more sense to undersand this character. I do think if I had not worked with these people, I may have lost some of the significance of her behaviors. I am glad the author did verify my suspicions in the first book and not right off the start either. The intrigue game me a chance to analyze what and how the dialog was written.  Very well done!  I especially would recommend this to those working in the mental health field or to those who deal with exceptional children!

B00127RAJY|4.0|I did a bit of research before I bought this DVD, but I'm glad I did. I'm not even half way through Level 3 right now and I've lost about 6-7 pounds. I didn't expect to lose a ton of weight since I'd already lost about 25 pounds before starting the Shred, but it's taken me past my plateau and then some. I'd definitely recommend. It's not a cake walk either... I was sore for the first three days of the workout, but it does go away, promise.
B000IFQLSW|5.0|Of course the music is the attraction here but set that aside for a moment, this documentary is so beautifully filmed I could watch it with the sound off. But I'd recommend that you settle in and enjoy it at full volume.

B00297FEUI|5.0|Steve Jablonsky's composition for Transformers 2 is absolutely stunning.  It ranks among the top soundtracks of all time.  It's far better than the movie, which I found predictable and repetitious CGI-wise and boring plot-wise.  I hope Jablonsky's next project will do justice to his musical talent.
B003C1QIO6|3.0|I found Jack Johnson's music recently, I don't listen to the radio much and I listen mostly to classical and jazz. I've bought all of his CDs. Jack Johnson's music is very good and I hope he has a very long and prolific career. I feel his music is refreshing, engaging and enjoyable, my favorite song of his being \\"Constellations\\" on \\"In Between Dreams\\". \\"To The Sea\\" is good, but it doesn't achieve the level of melody that was \\"In Between Dreams\\". His music is well performed and is well recorded by audiophile standards. I wish he would release his music on hybrid SACD. Ultimately my criticisms of his work are few and minor. First, he uses a little too much bass. I know a lot of people like heavy bass, but it tends to tire me out and I am relieved when I reach tracks of his that don't use a lot of bass. Second, he tends to use multiple tracks to \\"sing with himself\\". With his style this is not necessary. I wish he would either leave it at one track or vary his harmonics a little more to make the use of multiple vocal tracks more meaningful and necessary. As long as I'm dreaming, I wish he would partner with Eddie Vedder for an entire album of music. Jack is very good alone but I think he could be one of the greats if he found the right music-writing partner.
B002JVWRAO|4.0|It pains me to give my favorite television show 4 out of 5. By being a favorite it almost by default should be 5 right.  And episodes like The End, Free to Be you and me, Point of no Return, My bloody Valentine and even it's finale Swan Song are up there are as some really great moments in SN history.  I could rewatch all of those  I mentioned and still be entertained.  Ben Edlund is a dark comic genius.  And the Devil was expertly written and played throughout leaving each episode he was in wanting more.  Don't get me wrong this is a MUST for anyone who likes Horror with a side of comedy.      I won't say more about those episode mentioned above, just enjoy them and now comes the critique.  \\"Fallen Idol\\" -ack Paris Hilton, really?  \\"Children are our future\\" -great another all powerful kid out there who can squash everything with his mind, oh and it was so close to being a good episode, \\"Dead men Don't wear plaids\\"- all the characters totally acting out of character and a waste of Zombies! BUT WORST OF ALL \\"MEAT SWAP\\".  That last one was painful to watch and I want to scratch it off the DVD.  Just don't watch it if you love the Winchesters, really.    Now about the DVD extras....  I have watched my DVR episodes several time while I waited for the DVD to come out, hoping to get a little more insight into the season.  Especially the last season with Eric Kripke at the helm and we get ONE audio Commentary???? And a few less then encompassing featurettes. I love the commentaries and was so hoping for one for \\"Point of No return\\" \\"Free to be You and Me\\" or Swan Song.  Now \\"the End\\" was great but really guys, would it kill you to take another hour or two and give us a few more.  That is why we love the box sets, faithful fans want to know what you were thinking when you do major challenges to our characters. Hear about the obstacles and cool things you had to do to make the episodes.  Just so disappointing to be shorted on that.  I would have even loved if the DP or Special effects person did one if the writers and producers were too busy.  Ah well, opportunity lost.     In short get this set, it is worth it.  But it does contain some of the worst episodes in the series.

B0032Y8XH8|5.0|\\"Sigh No More\\" is the 2010 equivalent of 2009's album from The Avett Brothers, \\"I and Love and You.\\" Mumford and Sons create the same kind of modern, heartfelt and forceful folk-rock as the Avetts, and \\"Sigh No More\\" is a tightly spun collection that has not a duff song in its dozen numbers. It's easily this year's best folk album and a contender for one of the best of the year overall.<br /><br />While the four members aren't actually family, they harmonize like they were born for it. Marcus Mumford, the chief songwriter, gives them actual poetry to work with, which is rare enough in popular culture, and even a rarer find throughout a full album. The first time I heard \\"Little Lion Man,\\" I was floored by its brutal tear down of a man too petty and vindictive to realize he is only poisoning himself.<br /><br />\\"Tremble little lion man,<br />you'll never settle for any of your scores<br />your grace is wasted in your face,<br />your boldness stands alone among the wreck.<br />Learn from your mother or else spend your days biting your own neck.\\"<br /><br />That was it for me; thanks to Pandora I was sold on the spot. There are plenty of other diamond moments on \\"Sigh No More,\\" like the angry \\"White Blank Page\\" and the waltz-time \\"Awake My Soul.\\" There's plenty of temptation to compare Mumford and Sons to a host of other bands besides the Avett Brothers, but that would do both groups a disservice. This album stands alone just splendidly.
B002EWD08Q|4.0|Overall it wasn't my favorite arctic monkeys CD but it has some great tracks, like secret door,potion approaching and Cornerstone. As always their album art was not the best, what is it with them? I can design better album art. The CD came in a folded piece of cardboard, really? Still a good CD, but the B-sides as always are the best.
B003QCCS36|4.0|From the opening funk of \\"Repo Man\\" to the final jerky chord in \\"Devil's In The Jukebox,\\" Ray LaMontagne's fourth major label studio release kicks into a pocket that only his first came close to. Now totally self-produced and with a full band, LaMontagne sounds better than ever.<br /><br />There's a lot of Dylan and Van Morrison again, especially on the steel-guitar centered \\"New York City's Killing Me.\\" The production is less reverb heavy than on \\"Gossip In The Grain,\\" and he seems over the heartache that fueled \\"Til The Sun Turns Black.\\" \\"Beg Steal or Borrow\\" refects these changes in its countrified arrangements and the look back at what he's done since. \\"Your old friends...now they just bore you,\\" he laments. At the same time, it feels like is creativity has made a huge leap.<br /><br />Is LaMontagne a changed man then? Leaving producer Johns behind might seem so, this album's more homogenized sound also says yes. While the grittier and snarling \\"Repo Man\\" is the poppiest thing here, the remaining album rests nicely in a folk-country vein, without any clinkers like \\"Gossip's\\" \\"Meg White.\\" \\"God Willin'\\" is easily one of the year's best from an artist that just continues to impress.

B00383ZTXO|5.0|Drenched in iconic and infamous legend, it may be hard to believe that this early 1973 release was close to being buried in a vault and was such a Billboard chart failure (peaking at a sluggish #182) that - for years - domestic record buyers were relegated to searching import bins to find a copy.<br /><br />The Stooges were known as the midwest version of The Doors during their first run through a self-titled debut (1969) and Fun House (1970), before imploding due to many demons found outside the band's home of Ann Arbor, Michigan. David Bowie's MainMan Management signed the group, which was initially down to Iggy Pop and new guitarist James Williamson. The duo eventually added former Stooges Ron Asheton (switching from guitar to bass) and Scott Asheton (drums).<br /><br />Produced by Pop, his initial mix was deemed inferior by MainMan and - under the threat that the album was not going to be released - agreed to have Bowie remix seven of the eight tracks (Pop's \\"Search and Destroy\\" remained), which was done in one day. The original Pop mix has been released (\\"Rough Power\\"), along with his 1997 remix, but the fast work by Bowie to salvage the project is superior.<br /><br />Though marred by technical difficulties, the October 1973 gig in Atlanta, Georgia, features a motivated Pop and Ron Asheton proving beyond any doubt that he was one of the best bassists during this wild decade for rock music. That the tape languished in a vault and not cleaned up through studio overdubs is an incredible upside, since there is minimal quality recordings which capture The Stooges in their performance art glory. An outtake from the \\"Raw Power\\" sessions - the cool jam \\"Doojiman\\" - and a rehearsal of \\"Head On\\" conclude this second disc.<br /><br />That it took a small, but determined fan base to keep this album available is a testament to a time long ago; that it stands the test of time speaks loudly that those voices knew what they were talking about.
0143036556|4.0|I'll first say the only people I see giving this book a bad review are those that know a lot of details about the ancient societies covered and get to picky at them, then some that read Jared's first book advise not to read this one due to repeated information, and then redneck republicans that think it's a political agenda to acknowledge science and reality.    What I liked is that the book shows you the point of view of the society and those that destroy the society for their own personal gain.  You see why some businesses don't find it in their own interest to sustain the environment, yet others do.  Some businesses do actually get their act together and this book explains why and how.  So I like the book for it's explanation of both sides of the story in these instances, but it does get a bit wordy in parts.
0374158460|1.0|I made it to page 232 before bailing out. I wasn't interested at all, and when people asked me what it was about, I tuly answered, \\"I don't know.\\"   The slogging passages about conservation and strip-mining and bird refuges just destroyed the story. (We get it, Mr. Franzen: those are your interests. Save it for another book.) And the 'autobiography' section could have been condensed down to 3 pages of what was clearly just Mr. Franzen's endless descriptions; in no way did I feel like I knew Patty any more clearly than before. (For that section I blame his editor, who is obviously intimidated my the author.)   I really was excited to read this; I liked The Corrections a lot, except for the constant misuse of the word \\"longue\\" for \\"lounge\\", as in \\"chaise lounge\\". And I liked his book of essays, \\"How To Be Alone.\\" But as a novelist, I think I will pass on any of Mr. Franzen's future work, especially if it passes 500 pages. A good 200 could have been excised from this mess of a book.
0375507256|4.0|Mitchell is a great comedic writer.  I don't quite get the \\"interlinking\\" syle but it is enjoyable.  Mitchell really demonstrates his talents in the array of styles in each of the stories.  Really, I wished each section was it's own novel.  They are rich with characters and roller-coaster rides of plots.
B002ZG98C8|5.0|This film managed to squeeze in just about all of the reasons that the phobic haters of non-Protestant-caucasions (and marijuana) entering America are wrong: (1) illegal immigration from Mexico, in particular, is fed by corporate (and others') greed, (2) racial profiling is worse than the false \\"dangers\\" of Hispanics in our backyards, (3) the violence associated with pot is economic and not a result of pot-heads becoming violent, and (4) despite the hyperbole and exaggerated silliness (over-the-top violence, excessive nudiy, clever--but overused--humorous cliches, you-name-it) in the movie, people are basically human, no matter what their cultural background, race or religion might be.<br /><br />And yes, this movie got all of those plus all of the arguments against such overreaction (a.k.a. people-different-than-you phobias) and even a gory crucifixion into less than two hours. I was wondering ... what happened to the X-rating for commercial movies?<br /><br />Danny Trejo was actually \\"lovable,\\" and I'm anything but gay.  See it!
B002ZG993Q|1.0|This is perhaps the worst movie I've ever seen.  It starts out slow.  I kept expecting it to pick up speed and to find out what George Clooney was doing.  I was disappointed on both counts.  Clooney's character appears to be an extremely dull version of James Bond.  He can't hold a conversation, never responds with more than five words, speaks in a monotone, and he lacks anything resembling a personality.  Being that he is a tedious person, he needs to pay for sex.  Inexplicably, one of the prostitutes is attracted to this aging, boring man.  Presumably this has something to do with the sexual skills he demonstrates in an embarrassing soft porn scene and the fact that he's a good tipper.  We see their relationship flower during ten minutes of togetherness during which Clooney remains inarticulate.  We are never clued into what's happening in this movie.  People keep trying to kill Clooney and he is pretty good at killing them first.  We see him assemble a lot of guns; at times the movie reminded me of an instructional film that one might watch in shop class.  At the end, Clooney delivers some sort of envelope, receives a big wad of cash, and then his boss wants to kill him.  One can't help but wonder why his boss didn't just FedEx the envelope.  There are probably details in the book that would have made sense of this nonsense.  Apparently the screenwriters missed the class where it was explained that they should assume the audience didn't read the book and that the script needs to explain what's going on.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|I purchased this movie as a gift for my cousin after she and I viewed my own DVD of this film.  It has such powerful messages and such fantastic graphics that it is definitely a collector's item.

There are some important messages that we all could benefit from in it.
B001CEE1YE|4.0|I am not going to review the films, since you more than likely have an opinion yourself.  Having said that, if you enjoy movies and movie extras - hours of extras - than this is the collection to buy.

0316017922|5.0|I read this book twice before I bought it to pass along to others in my family. I think they were tired of my talking about it so much.   To me it was a revelation that success in almost any field is the outcome of hard, persistent long term work perfecting your skill in a chosen field. 10 years, 10,000 hours of hard work (no dilettants are welcome!) will assure mastery in a field, whether athletics, music, software engineering, or creative arts! Forget the old excuse that \\"you can't do that; you don't have the \\"talent\\" \\". If you have the capacity to put in long, hard, focused effort, you have the talent!
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Outstanding series, this being the last book of the trilogy.  Gripping, you feel like you know these people personally.  Salander is incredible, a star and a survivor.  The tradegy is that Steig Larsson died and now we can never know the joy of books 4 through 10, that he had outlines on, the continuing saga of Salander and Blomquist.  Cannot recommend them enough - 5 star +.  Hope Steig's father relents and allows the outlines be published or have some other writer use them for the continuation.  I would be first in line to read them.
0307474712|3.0|The characters were unlikeable; the situations were real enough;  the ending was unexpected but almost predictable for their whole lives lived apart and together.  I still had to finish the book.  It reminded me a little bit of The Last Time They Met, far from \\"Same Time, Next Year\\".
0679890475|4.0|Great board book.  The story is about a little bird who can't find mom, the bird hatches while she is out... but she comes back...  The bird encounters other animals trying to find mommy.  It reinforces that mommy will return.  This is an important lesson for little ones to know that after a day at the sitter, daycare, etc... that mommy is coming back for them.  The only thing about this book that I didn't care for is the coloring.  However, that being said, my daughter doesn't mind the less than colorful book.  She often picks it for our reading selection.

0679882820|5.0|My daughter is 18mo. old and we have been reading this one for some time now.  Yes, it is a board book version, but it is excellent for the age group being targeted. (babies and toddlers)  She loves to make the different sounds and is fascinated when adults make the different sounds.  This is a wonderful book.  It is the perfect size and weight for little ones to be able to hold and look through.
0786956291|5.0|I've been playing D&D since the release of the starter box this one's front is made from.  I bought this out of nostalgia, and yesterday got to put it in action with a friend and my fiance who had never played before.  It was great for a beginner.  The player's manual kept them in the game and not worrying about all of the things on the character sheet, instead focusing on one or two items so that they orient themselves with how the game is played.  My fiance, who didn't think would like it, wants to play more.<br /><br />I will say that I thought some of the player's manual was flawed; for instance, there was no real explanation of what the attack on the cards meant (i.e. Intelligence vs Fortitude attacks, etc.); maybe we missed it.  Also, the fighter did not end up with their constitution score/modifier, but that could have been a misread of the \\"Choose your own Adventure\\"-style of the player's handbook.  Overall I think it far surpasses any other introduction to the D&D universe.  Giving players cards to hold and use, a nice map for layout, and in my opinion, a better to-the-point character sheet, made all the difference here.  I might actually have a new campaign after about 13 years of not playing!<br /><br />If you are going to teach someone new how to play D&D or if you want to get back into the game after a few years, I think this is a MUST HAVE starter to do so.
0439023513|4.0|I can't believe people who are giving this book negative reviews, especially those who claim to be fans of the first two, but blast this one for being too dark, violent or grim. What were you people expecting? Did you really think that the third part of this story would be LESS violent, and suddenly take a MORE bright and cheery approach to the subject matter?    The Hunger Games and Catching Fire were brutally violent books, with a character that had been to hell and back, TWICE. There was no way Collins could write a third book and take it easy on Katniss, the other characters in the world, or the readers. She delivered the best book possible, that remains true to the characters as she created them. Yes, the book is a condemnation of war (as were the first two). Yes, characters we like die violently (as in the first book). And yes, Katniss is a complete, unsure of almost everything she says and does (as in the first two books). But just as Collins did in the first two books, she does again, in creating complex characters trapped in a world of moral ambiguity, where the stakes are life and death.
0439023483|5.0|Set in a dystopian future of North America, The Hunger Games follows Kat, Peeta, Prim, and the other youth involved in the barbaric sport to remind Panem of the Capitol's power on a yearly basis. Forced into an arena for all of Panem to see, the \\"tributes\\" from each district must fight one another for survival. When Prim, Kat's younger sister, is selected though, Kat takes her place without a second thought. To stay alive and to earn sponsors and gifts, Kat forges and unlikely alliance with Peeta, the tribute boy from her district. More than just one thing threatens their alliance...<br /><br />Ok, I've heard the most amazzzzinnnggg things about this book, but for some reason I just never got around to buying it. I can't believe I waited so long! I am so dumb! I could not put this book down. The concept, the verbiage, the characters...it's terrifyingly realistic, and it truly is one of the most alive books I've ever read. Suzanne Collins created a tangible masterpiece that is as riveting as it is believable.<br /><br />This is just the first book in the series, with Catching Fire being the next in the series. I can't wait to read it! I give The Hunger Games a 5 out of 5, and I honestly wouldn't change a single thing about it.
030726999X|4.0|An exciting finale to the Lisbeth Salander trio that leaves one craving more.  The twists and turns in the complex plot keep the reader's attention and make it hard to put it down.  Lisbeth is a character who really wins hearts.
0439023513|5.0|In The Hunger Games, we watched as Katniss Everdeen was thrust into a life of terror, violence, and discord when she took Prim's place in the annual Hunger Games. We watched her form an alliance, then an uneasy friendship with Peeta Mellark. Catching Fire showed us what happens when the Capitol of Panem sees the ripple of hope fluttering through the Districts, and we're forced to watch the unthinkable happen - the Tributes are thrust into the Games, or the Quarter Quell, this time. Without knowing she was doing so, Katniss sparked hope in the suffering Districts, giving them something to live and fight toward, so when we watch her pulled from the arena of the Quarter Quell, we felt hope.<br /><br />Mockingjay is the third and final book in this trilogy, showing us what happens when one girl ignites the fire of hope, pride, and rebellion. Katniss never wanted a life in the spotlight. She never wanted to be a symbol, but without knowing it, she has become one. Plucked from the arena and finally aware that the ever-elusive District 13's survival is not a myth, Katniss is thrust headlong into a war that she helped spark. With her friends and family. and despite the missing Peeta, Katniss must decide whether or not she can and will remain the symbol of the new revolution. Can Katniss be the Mockingjay?<br /><br />Mockingjay is not a light book. The third in this series of Dystopian novels, it's much darker than before. Suzanne Collins has created a world in Panem that forces us to look at the very base of human survival and where we find our humanity. Mockingjay strips its characters down to the core and makes it very clear that nobody acts or reacts the same in a war. Violence changes people, and Mockingjay shows that in every struggle there are sacrifices that must be made. Revealing the innermost workings of the characters is a true strength in this book, and you get to know what makes the characters tick. It's dark, and it's haunting, but it's perfect.<br /><br />I know this is a weak review, but I don't want to reveal anything for those who have not yet read Mockingjay. I was prepared for it to be dark and painful, but this is definitely the darkest of the three books. Whereas a lot of the violence was \\"off-screen\\" in the first two books, Mockingjay does not hesitate to describe the brutality both felt and seen. It's heartbreaking, heartwrenching and yet, at times, just a tad humourous with glimmers of hope. I feel the ending was completely fitting, and while I wish the story could go on forever, Mockingjay ended at the perfect moment. The single qualm I have with this book is that it took me a few pages to truly understand what was happening. Either way, this book is a clear 5 out of 5, and I recommend it to all followers of the series, YA fans, and those who love Dystopian novels.w, but I don't want to reveal anything for those who have not yet read Mockingjay.

B000V6BE6M|5.0|As everyone else has said more eloquently than I can muster - wonderful, immersive and fantastic value for money. God bless you Peter Jackson and Howard Shore!
0439023491|5.0|Oh. My. Gosh. I hardly know where to start on Catching Fire! Ok (deep breaths)...we'll start at the beginning. Katniss and Peeta, despite all odds set against them, survive the Capitol's Hunger Games and must embark on a victory tour of the Districts, forcing them to face their victim's families, while said families must pretend to love, adore, and admire the people who killed their children in the arena. Katniss and Peeta, as well as their mentor, Haymitch, just want the Games to be over. The Capitol, however, does not. The Hunger Games are a reminder of their power, and Katniss and Peeta upset the balance when both of them survived the arena.<br /><br />Unknowingly, Katniss and Peeta have sparked a rebellion in the Districts, causing President Snow to take notice and prompting him to introduce a twist into the year's Quarter Quell. The tributes will, this time, be drawn from the previous victors of the Hunger Games...the very same victors who have been guaranteed freedom from re-entry ever again. One man and one woman from each District must enter, and there's only one female from District 12. It's inevitable. Katniss and Peeta will fight to the death in the arena again.<br /><br />I'm going to stop summarizing there because I really, really don't want to give anything away. After I read The Hunger Games, I had to get my paws on Catching Fire ASAP, so I went to the bookstore first thing in the morning. I read it in one day. I couldn't put it down. I felt soooo angry towards the Capitol, and every twist and turn in this book is like a knife in your gut. It's riveting.<br /><br />I give this book a 5 out of 5, hands down. While some people hate the abrupt endings, I think they're brilliant...they keep you hanging! I can't wait for the third book, Mockingjay, set to release August 24th! I can't wait!
0545123275|4.0|SHIVER had me questioning how it would turn out and whether I would like how it ended.  I wasn't sure what the reality of the story was going to be.  I'm glad with how it ended enough that I am eager to read the second book LINGER.    Stiefvater created Sam and Grace, two characters who immediately draw you into their worlds.      One winter day 6 years ago, Grace is swinging in her back yard when she is grabbed by a pack of wolves who begin to fight over her, until she finds the bright yellow eyes of one of the wolves who can't seem to shake the heart behind her eyes. Grace is so straight and honest that when she finally finds that one person who makes her waiver from that line it makes her even more heart warming and honest.  She's the grown up in her world, and her falling in love was innocent and sweet.    Sam is a werewolf who was bitten when he was young and forced to become the animal that haunts him every winter.  Sam wants to stay Sam and he fights the change every winter, but he knows that this is his last summer of being Sam forever.  It takes one moment to change Sam and Grace's life forever.  When a boy is ravaged by the wolves in Boundary Woods, a hunting party goes looking for these animals and shoots Sam causing him to change back from wolf to boy.  Grace finds him wounded on her deck and takes him in.  He has the same eyes as the wolf who saved her 6 years before.    It's a tender story told with maturity.  This is one of the most tender love stories I've read in the young adult genre and I feel that this held a delicate balance between young love and true love.
B000S570EG|5.0|I haven't listened to Cat Power in almost five years.  The first song I had ever heard was called \\"Names\\" from You are Free.  The music is unapologetic yet filled with a great amount of vulnerability.  I think that's what Chan Marshall represented at the time Moon Pix was made.  Each song is a different shade of fear, regret, hopelessness.  The reason I stopped listening to her albums is because sometimes the simplicity of it gets really intense.  At times, it's just her and a guitar, and it feels like she's sitting right in front of you with a list of all of the emotions you can't seem to place.  It's haunting like that.<br /><br />So this album isn't for everyone.  I heard \\"Metal Heart\\" and \\"Back of Your Head\\" again when I recently watched the film Dedication.  I was surprised by how well the songs were placed, and I was transported back again at fifteen and sixteen, and I felt like I was listening to her sing to me all over again.<br /><br />The reason I love this album is for the very reason some people hate it.  It's simple in a way.  The chords are repetitious, and her voice is constantly wavering.  This isn't an album to listen to when you're happy.  This is what you listen to when you're at the edge of something.  But that is the beauty of this album, and it's the reason why I come back to it again and again.
B001UV4XUG|5.0|These days there is such a steady influx of cookie cutter rom-coms that after a while they all start to look, sound, and feel the same. Some are cutesy, some are full of teenage drama, some are about as convincing as watching the opening auditions of American Idol (entertaining in the fact that they're so bad) but they're full of  fluff. And then there are those delicately crafted, smart, and charming films that you walk away from with a smile on your face, not an eye roll. For me, 500 Days of Summer is such a film.   The story centers around Tom, a young man who's waiting for the girl of his dreams, and Summer, the one who he believes to fit the role. They begin a doomed relationship since Summer has made her skepticism of love due to her parents divorce when she was a girl very clear. She's just doing it for fun. I have seen this mindset among singles around me. Disillusionment with true love so they settle on just a feel-good romance or never open themselves to love at all. Does true love even really exist or is it fantasy? What does love even mean? This is the film's main theme as both Tom and Summer try to come to an answer.   Some have said it was too sad or depressing for a romance-comedy. And even the narrator says up front \\"This is not a love story\\". There are scenes where Tom is trying to get over Summer but he's just so depressed that it starts to take a toll on the viewer. But anyone who has gone through a breakup and felt the shadow that seems to follow you everywhere can empathize with Tom. It was inspiring to see how, while he was still hurting over her, this kind of wake up call was what he needed to get control of his life. And in the end, both of them are able to believe in love again. I won't ruin it for you, but the last scene made me smile so it does end on a good note.  Technically speaking, the film was surprisingly good. The acting was great, especially Summer, played by the cute and down-to-earth Zooey Deschanel. I thought her line delivery,her voice, her tinge of quirkiness was very endearing. Some might think her acting was shallow but it was a breath of fresh air to see an actress in a romance film who wasn't tan, blonde, and constantly either out of breath, in tears, or strutting in high heels. The supporting actors are also full of personality. The lines are full of wit and humor that actually made me laugh, which is always good in a successful comedy. The soundtrack and songs featuring Regina Spektor, The Smiths, and  some lower profile but talented artists was very affective with the scenes they were matched with. And it was a concise hour and a half which is always nice when you're just in the mood for a quick feel-good movie. I've watched it probably half a dozen times and it doesn't  gets old. Really, a surprisingly good film that I think people on both sides of the spectrum can enjoy.
B003ITZBVS|4.0|At first I thought it was going to be a crappy Batman movie, they didn't have Kevin Conroy, but after I started watching, the story was dark, the voice acting was top notch, and the action was great. The Batman movies, live action and animated, just keep getting better and better. If you don't see this one you have missed out and if your a fan and you don't have this in your collection your crazy because this is a must have.
B002UXRGLG|5.0|We purchased this for our 4 year old son, who is nature-obsessed! We had found that a lot of documentaries were too gory or distressing for him. This one really fits the bill. Obviously animals get killed, but on the whole they get killed off camera! I would recommend this for any parents or teachers concerned about the sensitivity of their audience.
0307454541|1.0|I devour books. Adore them. Have read 25 huge ones this summer, ranging from old classics to light stuff to huge 1000 page epics, and this one ranks at the very bottom. I am completely and totally in shock about the hype surrounding this book. I have stumbled upon a group of librarians swooning over the tale, I have had it recommended by many, and was not expecting this boring tale, which could have been a bad episode of Law and Order SVU set in Sweden. I laughed out loud that the back cover even dare mention Ingmar Bergman as a comparison!!!<br /><br />Don't waste your time or your kronor! :)
B000FC1AOI|2.0|Rarely is the case that a movie supersedes a book, but after reading P.S. I love you I found the that movie told Gerry and Holly's story such much better. While the book is slightly entertaining, the author fails to attach the reader to Gerry, Holly's deceased husband. He was the driving force behind everything that she did in the book and he's is almost non existent in the pages!
0679746323|3.0|The question, as I said it above, is can a 1000 page book be shallow. Well Jung Chang and Jon Halliday have proven that it basically can. As a couple other reviews have pointed out, this book has an almost totalitarian interest in selling, no, cramming one single message down your (eyes?) page after page. That message is that Mao was a terrible person whose personality was about a half inch deep and completely evil for the entire half inch. Now don't get me wrong, I believe Mao did some awful things, some very awful things, but the problem with this book is that it is never satisfied to let you make your own conclusions on these issues. If a single sentence is written about a good deed from Mao, it is followed immediately, not even nearly immediately but immediately with an entire paragraph condemning the previous act as a freak occurrence or the element of some other evil plot. A lot of the points made are highly subjective. It is as though the authors are constantly afraid of letting the reader slip away and think that Mao was anything other than a manipulative psychopath. Honestly there is enough information in this book alone (otherwise) to make that point quite clearly without all of the aggressive hand holding. I had previously read the excellent biography of another 20th century red giant, 'Stalin: The Court of the Red Tsar' by Simon Sebag Montefoire, which was a similar length. That book manages to convey a stronger messages about the negative qualities of Stalin's character while allowing the reader the respect to make these decisions on their own. It's basically the difference between saying 'Three thousand people were shot.' or 'Three thousand people were shot and this was a bad act of a bad man.' All that hand holding does is present a lengthy yet shallow, very shallow, portrait of Mao, and this over the course of nearly one thousand pages. As far as the history aspects of the book it is quite valuable. But I can't help feeling that the same informationcould be gathered elsewhere and in a more effective manner. This book was meticulously researched individually, especially throughout China, and that makes it valuable. I'm not familiar with the other works on Mao and his life, so I can't say if there is a better alternative. Though in spite of this I cannot really recommend this book to anyone except the Mao scholar who has read many sources and is capable of looking at a subjective viewpoint through objective eyes. Either they or someone who is looking to embolden their hatred of the man Mao, and who might be particularly scared of having their sentiments swayed by even an iota of positivity. It really seems that the authors had an axe to grind, either personally or by what they perceived as an obligation to the Chinese who died. Honestly for me I just wish the book offered more dimension to what must have been a very deep person. Though I could be wrong, Mao could simply be an automaton of evil and greed, which leads me to an alternative subtitle for this book: Mao: The Devil's Robot. Read at your own discretion, but honestly, you won't need to use it. The introduction should finalize with, 'Now please take off both your shoes and discretion and come inside, you will be taken care of from here.'

0765350386|5.0|Prior to reading this book I had read Sanderson's books [[ASIN:0765350378 Elantris]] and [[ASIN:0765360039 Warbreaker (Tor Fantasy)]]  and loved them both.  I was super excited to get started on this series.  This book was everything I had hoped it would be and more.  A wonderful epic fantasy, with a creative magic system, and characters you can really love.<br /><br />This book goes between two main characters.  The first is Kelsier, a member of the oppressed Skaa race who has escaped horrible punishment at the hand of the Lord Ruler and is determined to lead a rebellion to overthrow the Final Empire.  The second is Vin, a skaa who is part of the thieving group.  Vin gets entangled in Kelsier's scheme and finds out that she has powers of a Mistborn.<br /><br />The setting for this book is pretty bleak.  The Final Empire is located in a place where ash constantly rains down on the landscape and fields and forests are yellow and dying.  The skaa is a race of serf-like humans who slave for the ruling class and are kept complacent through cruelty and Soothing by Mistlings.<br /><br />The magic system is very creative, Sanderson has created a system where Mistlings or Mistborn swallow different metallic elements and can burn them to create various affects.  He explains the complicated system in a way that is interesting and easy to understand; and shows creativity and flexibility to the magic system that makes it work in a wide variety of circumstances.<br /><br />The plot is very complex, but not overwhelmingly so.  Sanderson keeps the cast of characters manageable and makes characters easy to recognize.  The characters are complex with rich histories and conflicted personalities but they are all somewhat lovable.  A lot of the characters are grey in morale; they are thieves but they work for a cause, they try to do right but people suffer from their actions.<br /><br />I loved these characters; especially Vin.  Vin changes so much throughout the book.  She starts out as a lowly thief eking out a living and ends up a power to be reckoned with.  Kelsier is a force to be dealt with on his own; his character has a powerful personality that you love at times and dislike at others.  This really is the place where Sanderson is exceptional; he creates a wonderful world but his characters are awesome.  They bring humor and softness to a world that would be plain without them; these are some of the best characters in epic fantasy that I have read about for a while.<br /><br />Overall I was very impressed, nothing to complain about...I loved it.  The characters are entertaining and well done, the plot intriguing, the magic system creative.  Sanderson has built a world and characters that you want to read about and turned them into a story that is very hard to put down.  I am very eager to read the next book in this series [[ASIN:0765356139 The Well of Ascension (Mistborn, Book 2)]].ends up a power to be reckoned with.

B000LPQ6DE|3.0|I had high hopes for this Masterpiece Theatre production.  I was disappointed, however, in that it departs way too much from the original book.  I realize that to put such a book into a three-hour space requires some alterations; however, this one changed parts of the story which would have been just fine--and superior even--had they been left intact.  If you haven't read Jane Eyre, you may like this production and will get the gist of the story.  If, however, you are something of a Jane Eyre purist, as I am, then don't bother.  The best production, by far, is the old 1980s BBC version starring Timothy Dalton. That one is a five-star version.
B004132HZS|5.0|it's elementary, my dear reader.<br /><br />i'm a huge fan of the old arthur conan doyle stories so i was dubious when i heard sherlock was being \\"modernized.\\" but the series works extraordinarily well. after watching the three 90 minute episodes, i feel as if benedict cumberbatch IS sherlock holmes. he is phenomenal in the role, and so is martin freeman. the setting might be modern, but the clever dialogue, the intrigue, the sense of adventure, sherlock's prickliness and john's eternal patience shine brightly. and the score is amazing as well. i'd love a soundtrack, hint, hint.<br /><br />there is only one negative about this series, and that's the fact there won't be new episodes for quite some time.
B002ZG97RE|4.0|I expected Green Zone to track more closely to the book upon which the movie was based; \\"Green Zone, Imperial Life in the Emerald City\\", and indictment of the Paul Bremer time in Iraq. Instead the movie's focus was on Matt Damon's character and his team of WMD searchers, which was a minor part of the book. The movie perfectly captured the chaos in Iraq at the opening stages of the war as American troops captured Baghdad, and proceeded to consolidate their presence in Iraq. The handheld camera technique emphasized the way unplanned events unfold and the need to plan on the fly as obstacles present themselves. This movie probably captures the feeling of war as well as any movie. Matt Damon is excellent in his role as a chief warrant officer who takes his job seriously and knows when he is getting a lot of b.s. from his superiors. The cast is uniformly excellent and again the movie captures the tension that existed between the CIA and the Defense Department over the authenticity of the information supplied regarding WMD's in Iraq. The CIA was getting it's information from a former Iraqi general in charge of the WMD program whereas the Defense Department was getting its information from a guy code named \\"curveball\\" whom even German intelligence said was unreliable. The movie version consolidated the informant into one character, the Iraqi general. There really was a huge disconnect between the civilian political operatives as depicted by the character Poudstone and the military grunts depicted by Damon. Donald Rumsfeld set up is own intelligence operation because he did not trust CIA intelligence or because the CIA was not telling him what he wanted to hear. The movie made it perfectly clear that the CIA and the Defense Department did not get along. I highly recommend this movie since it was not only entertaining but at least 50-75% true account of what happened during that period of time in Iraq.

0374158460|1.0|Inspite of the praises leashed upon Jonathan Franzen's Freedom I am here to differ.  Freedom is nothing more than a poorly scripted soap opera.  Franzen's writing is stream of conscientiousness that goes off in so many different directions without any conclusion or reader satisfaction.  The writing is empty, dry and above all boring.  Repeat...boring.  Franzen's has no command of the characters and certainly there is a story to tell but Franzen doesn't know what it is.  The editor that green lighted this project should look for work in Mad Magazine.  The worst part is that this book cost me $28 of my hard earned money and hours of my time spent in agony over such dribble.  Maybe Franzen, himself, should look for a new line of work and not be put off as a writer for our times or any time.

B002N8A14M|4.0|First a response to all those complaining about the lip of plastic around the headphone jack: if your headphones don't fit then just trim the plastic a little until they do. Just grab a boxcutter, hobby knife, or even a sharp steak knife and widen out the area right around the plug. You could trim quite a bit of material here without weakening the case so just do it.    And for my own comments,    Pros: Looks good. Fits the iPod like a glove. Can easily be popped in and out of the case in 5 seconds. Seems like it would protect the iPod from a fair amount of damage. You slip extra headphone wire into the clip to reduce slack.    Cons: Yes, you do have to trim it for most headphones to fit properly. The clip is between your arm and the iPod so it does have a bit more movement than I would like when running (also protects it from sweat).     Overall: Cut the plastic and enjoy. Would buy again, but hopefully won't have to.

0143034901|3.0|This book wasn't too bad, at the beginning. A good protagonist, adequate antagonists, and just enough murk and suspicion to keep you reading. Dark houses with locked doors, secret meetings in abandoned gardens, and a solid set of background characters make an intrigueing scene, until you get to the end and Zafon decides that everything needs an ending.<br /><br />First, and maybe this is just me, I was quite let down by the big reveal: that the lovers are half-siblings. I'm cynical and liberal enough to ask, \\"so what?\\" For me, that information is not enough to allow the type of violence imposed on them. Everything that these characters went through was to unravel the mystery of why two people were so horifically treated? And the only thing is that they were slightly related? It didn't seem enough reason, to me, for any of the characters to act the way they acted.<br /><br />Not only did I balk at what atrocities were perpetrated for such a minor detail, but I was also disappointed that so many ends were left hanging. I suppose you might like it if you're not expecting the end to deliver the bang that the beginning promised.

B002KVSJ64|3.0|Breaking Benjamin is a great band. Let me start off by making sure that is clear. This album is consistent, it is without a single bad track. The problem with this is that there is nothing that will jump out and make you say \\"wow\\" the way songs like Breath and Next to Nothing did. Its not bad at all, just not something that will go down as one of their best. It lacks the wow factor

0553805371|1.0|As someone with just a physics/math 101 background I found that the text tried to accomplish too much with too little detail. Complex quantitative constructs can't be explained in several paragraphs/pages. I imagine that for those readers with an extensive physics/math background the explanations were too superficial with a 'same-old-same-old quality,' and for those in my shoes with little or superficial backgrounds the discussion of M-theory and its implications left us wondering what the authors were talking about.  I think that the problem with this book was that the authors tried to have it both ways- that is, to provide a non-watered-down didactic experience for the non-scientist educated reader, but at the same time address the sophisticated physics/math professional with a substantial work. I believe that neither goal was accomplished, and that is why I gave the work a one star rating.

0786955570|5.0|Caveat: I played this game at GenCon (Indianapolis; August 4 - 8, 2010) however, as of this writing, the game is not yet available. At the time it was a complete shrink-wrapped game box and package as one would purchase and I am inclined to believe that it is the finished product, pending any severe issues that may have come up during the course of people playing it at the convention.    Now, on with the review:   The components of this game are many. There are several sheets of punch tiles that comprise the game boards, character cards, status modifiers, health pips, coffins, etc. The box, itself, makes for a poor means to store all of these bits and pieces and you may consider baggies, counter trays, or other means of keeping certain tokens from intermingling between sessions to make set-up go a little more smoothly. The parts themselves are very sturdy wood-stock bits (similar to those used by Fantasy Flight Games - for those familiar with their board game offerings) and are therefore quite robust and will last you many-many years without damage or loss from being blown aside by a mild cough. There are several plastic miniatures, of excellent quality (unpainted), that are conveniently color coded by type. Undead (skeletons, zombies, etc) are white, animals are brown, spectral undead (ghosts, specters, etc) are a translucent blue, notorious villains (Strahd, werewolf, etc) are a dark grey, and the heroes are alight grey. I found this distinction to be very helpful in taking quick glances of the board and seeing how monsters were grouped versus the distribution of the PCs as well as seeing where any allies were located and obstacles between without having to examine every mini on the grid. This also makes monster placement simpler in that you are now examining a smaller pool of minis to locate rats, versus having to search though all of them at once.    The game `board' is crafted through the course of play. Several tiles represent rooms and corridors of the castleand as you and your fellow heroes move, more of the castle is revealed. This is similar to the Avalon Hill game \\"The Betrayal at the House on the Hill\\". Unlike that game, heroes do not need to enter the tile/room to place it but simply be near the edge of a tile. With each tile enters a new monster, and possibly an encounter based on the mark on the tile, who goes under the control of the player that drew it and it will perform certain specific actions on the monster turn of the game. Defeating monsters gains the heroes equipment and experience points. The experience points go into a community pool and can be used to level up your hero or negate certain encounters.    Aside from the rule booklet, there is also a scenario booklet. The scenario you choose will determine the victory conditions for the game. The game itself is cooperative and either the entire group wins or all of the heroes lose. Some of the scenarios seemed capable of being linked together (the scenario we played was \\"Hunt for Strahd, part one\\") and can become part of a larger and longer game played over several weekends. I should also think that one could also invent new scenarios not included with the original book.    While the hero cards are definitely crafted with the current Dungeons and Dragons rules set in mind (4th edition) they only seem to have a 1st level and 2nd level power set. This makes the bookkeeping minor and even someone (like myself) who has not played the fourth edition of the game is capable of comprehending and understanding their hero.    I found this game quite enjoyable and useful. It serves perfectly well as a board game by itself. For those Table-Top RPG gamers, its beautifully printed tiles, tokens, and the included minis, can very easily serve as dungeon mapping for your home campaigns. This game would also do well for those parents out there looking for a way to let their children experience RPG style play without delving into the morass of character sheets, race selection, statistic generation, and all of the bulk of the RPG system. Definately worth the price of admission.
B003L77TZI|1.0|I suppose you could say that I'm a bit like Zarathustra; after prolonged periods of time I descend from my mountain to see exactly what is going on in the civilization that I've shunned, in this case that civilization is modern pop music. A few times I've been positively surprised, like with M.I.A.'s Kala. Unfortunately 99% of the time it's been a waste of my time, and Katy Perry's newest album is a prime example of the kind of music I absolutely detest; pop music whose sole purpose is nothing more than revenue.    Unlike the vast majority of the repressed masses of America I was neither shocked nor interested in her \\"I Kissed a Girl\\" song 2 years ago or whenever it came out; \\"Oh, hey, gimmick music, this person won't last long.\\" Well, some people just don't know when to go away and what ends up being birthed from an unwillingness to depart before you release another album full of not one single memorable moment is generally the outcome.    I'd do a track by track review of the album, but what's the point? I won't be so stupid as to say all the songs sound the same, but they're certainly all lifeless and insipid, to say the least.    In the end her music doesn't mean anything to her other than a means to watch her bank account swell & to see herself on magazine covers; if her music actually meant something to her she'd take the time to write lyrics that were actually interesting. Hopefully in time the US and the rest of the world moves on with its fascination  with talentless musicians like Ms. Hudson and Lady Gaga.
B0015DROBO|4.0|TATTOO starts rather slowly. Quite a bit of it is set within the financial industry, which I found somewhat tedious. I was pleased to see the plot transition into a thriller. By the time I was halfway through the book I couldn't put it down and stayed up until 5 am reading it. That's the best recommendation a book can receive, imo. The only reason I gave the book 4 stars instead of 5 was because of its beginning, but much better to have a slow beginning than a slow ending! I can't wait to read FIRE and I &lt;really> can't wait to read HORNET'S NEST! (But I'll read FIRE first.)
0307291650|5.0|Anne Rice revamped the vampire-horror genre with the publication of \\"Interview with the Vampire,\\" a supernational drama from the vampire's own mouth. It became an unexpected hit, and spawned a series of sequels that came to be known as the Vampire Chronicles. The first three books of the series are compiled here, and arguably remain her best.<br /><br />\\"Interview With the Vampire\\" is the story of Louis, a grieving young widower and plantation owner, whose life is turned upside down when he meets the charming vampire Lestat. Lestat offers him a way out: become a vampire. Louis accepts, but once it's done, he finds that vampirism is more than he bargained for -- especially for his conscience.<br /><br />\\"The Vampire Lestat\\" takes a totally different tack, showing us the world through the enigmatic, charming Lestat's eyes. After years of dormancy, Lestat wakes up in time for the early MTV years of the 1980s, becoming a rock star in the tradition of Ozzy and Black Sabbath. And like Louis, Lestat relates his long life's story -- how he became a vampire, his wanderings over the earth, and his investigations into the origins of vampirism itself...<br /><br />\\"Queen of the Damned\\" builds on that research. Lestat's metal music has caused quite a bit of mayhem -- but not this much before: Akasha, Egyptian queen and mother of all vampires, has reawoken from her comalike sleep. The lesser vampires are having strange dreams, some are being murdered by the ruthless queen. Apparently she wants to kill virtually all men. What is more, Akasha has taken a shine to the roguish Lestat himself...<br /><br />Vampiric autobiography is a given in Anne Rice's bibliography -- she has plenty of bloodsuckers telling us about their lives. But Lestat and Louis's were not just the first ones, but perhaps the most compelling and rich, especially since the two had such radically different viewpoints -- including of one another. Is Lestat a heartless fiend, or a roguish good-craving bad boy? I'd lean towards the latter, to be honest.<br /><br />The first two books are quite personal -- one is Louis recounting his own miserable life and un-life. Then we get Lestat, a radically different viewpoint, a guy who enjoys his un-life even more than his mortal existance. Finally, there's an epic view of all vampires, throughout history, from the ancient Egyptian queen to the modern biker vamps. And it's rendered in lush, atmosphere-soaked prose that immerses you in the nightside of New Orleans.<br /><br />Despite the more controversial recent novels, Anne Rice's first Vampire Chronicles are often reckoned to be modern horror/fantasy classics.

B001N1DPDE|5.0|I have quite a few outside knives: other KBs, Cutco, Gerber, etc.  This is my favorite for the following reasons.    -Nearly indestructible blade, handle, and sheath  -Blade is lower than grip so food prep is accomplish-able  -Very well balanced even though it is a heavy knife.    When we camp/hunt/shoot/hike, this is the one knife that I always carry with me and it tends to stay in my Jeep.  It is well worth the money and I will probably end up buying more of them.    I wish they made a 3/4 version for my wife to carry when in the bush. We have the short KB tanto for that.  Other than that, I cannot overstate how much I like this knife.    Dave.

1594481938|3.0|Ah, that famous British wit is on full display in this novel, the first one I've read by Nick Hornby.  So much wit, in fact, that there's too little plot.  Four strangers -- a talk show host with a shattered career, a mother with a comatose son, a deranged Minister of Education's daughter, and a depressed musician -- find themselves trying to jump off the same roof-top, and end up together as a Suicides Anonymous support group, although they spend most of the time trashing each other.  It's all an overly clever premise that doesn't sustain itself over 200 pages.  There are some genuinely hilarious moments and insights in the novel, diamonds in the mud.
4883191036|5.0|Then read this book. For those in the know, this book series are used at actual Japanese universities for a reason: they work. When I went to Okinawa Japan, I studied from this 25-lesson book and the English translation piece. If you want something that will give you a solid commmand of the language, then get this, the Minna no Nihongo worksheets and the translations. I would  just go through this book with a Japanese friend to supplement the CDs (warning they're expensive).    You will be exploring life through the eyes of Mike Smith as he continues to work for his Japanese company and continues to make friends. There is a lot a humor in the lessons that make this an interesting self study piece. It is probably better for a class room, but I would use this to review what I know from time to time. It will go over high beginner to low intermediate Japanese grammatical forms and introduce you to about a thousand new vocabulary words. From there you are expected to be able to command the language at a conversational level.     Want to pass the JLPT level N4 and first portion of N3? Pick this book up along with some Kanzen Master books and you're good to go. You're words will flow like fluid with enough pratice.

0307463745|5.0|I devoured this book. I've worked for a start up for the past 3.5 years. It has been a very wild ride with a lot of ups and downs. We've learned a lot of lessons in this book the hard way. It doesn't matter if you're in software development or manufacturing, there are great lessons in this book for every business. I highly recommend it. If you're in software development I recommend also reading \\"Getting Real\\". A lot of the principals will be redundant, but there's a lot of specifics and references that will only sharpen your skills.
B001FB55YE|5.0|This film just has so much to talk about it's hard to find a place to start. The character development is excellent and travels at just the appropriate pace that you'll find your character (or few characters) that you'll absolutely love throughout the film. The story telling is just great and the language is very appropriate throughout the film. To put it simply, this movie is hilarious and the pacing makes it even funnier. It goes back and forth from serious moments to silly humor and the contrast between the two makes some scenes ridiculously funny. One of my favorite scenes is the one with The Russians, no spoilers, but you'll know what I'm talking about after you watch it. Definitely a must buy and is one of those films you could watch many, many times without losing interest. Went into this movie not knowing a single thing about it other than it was directed by Guy Richie and I was not disappointed; and neither will you.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|I hardly ever write reviews for the books I read, because I figure no matter what I say, someone else will have said it already. But I just finished reading Mockingjay, and I just can't contain myself after reading this tragic farce of an ending to a series that was so brilliantly begun.     Hunger Games was one of the best books I read this year, hands down. My pulse was literally racing as I read it, and I couldn't do anything other than read it until I had consumed the entire thing whole.     Catching Fire, which I read some months later, was a disappointment. I found Katniss' character flaws (selfishness, whining, total obliviousness, to name a few) to be more glaring than they were in the first, when they were overshadowed by the rip-roaring pace of the plot. I also found the love triangle plotline to be very wearisome -- hello, didn't we do that already with Jacob and Edward? Please.     And the whole rebel plotline tried to make the success of the first book into something it was not. Hunger Games worked because it was entirely contained within the small world of the Games. By trying to take Catching Fire to a larger level and make some kind of statement about Katniss' society (and therefore our own), I felt like the author lost sight of the limited scope that made the first novel so dynamic and original.    But the book picked up a great deal when they went back into the arena -- what can I say, perhaps I'm just a bored complacent Capitolite myself.     Unfortunately, all of what was bad about Catching Fire was back again in Mockingjay, without any brutally creative survivalism going on in the arena. I know storming the Capitol with its pods was supposed to be similar, but it just didn't do it for me. The writing was slopping, the plotting all over the place -- I didn't even realize when main characters died, or much care -- and again, the attempt to make a larger statement about the society of Panem was very heavy-handed.     Worst of all though was Katniss. By this point, I was so sick of her that I wished someone would just kill her off already. Gone is the dynamic, butt-kicking main character of the Hunger Games book, leaving in her place a guilt-ridden, whiny, unstable wreck dependent on the good will of those who -- for some strange reason -- continued to love her.     Katniss seems to drift along with the tide, changing her mind about her motives and alliances every ten pages or so, never able to go in a straight line or accomplish anything with purpose. Again, she reminded me far too much of Bella from the Twilight books. I started this series being glad that Katniss Everdeen represented an alternative to the indecisive, whiny role model that Bella gives to young women, and ended it sickened by yet another strong young woman wavering between boys while real life drama goes on around her.      My advice: save yourself and just stop reading after the first one. I wish I had.
0553805371|5.0|Dr. Hawking, THANK YOU!  Yet more points to ponder on our origins and place in the Universe, ruminations on why we're here and where we may be going...and the best part is that this sense of wonder and awe is based on data, science, and reality!  In a time of resurgent superstition and mystical nonsense (\\"creation science,\\"  Sylvia Browne-style frauds, fundamentalist religions, whatever), Dr. Hawking shows us that we don't have to make up fairies and elves and superstious gibberish in order to know the profound joy of being alive and curious.
0393072231|4.0|I had read \\"Liars Poker\\" and \\"Money Culture\\" and loved them, but for selfish reasons I avoided reading this book for as long as I could.(It was the free teaser from Amazon Kindle that finally hooked me.)     In this one Mr.Lewis profiles the principles of three unrelated investment pools - one Wall Street connected, the other two not connected - as they see opportunity in the years preceding the 2008 market meltdown. They each end up holding similar short positions on the mortgage bond market, but struggle differently getting into them. The Wall Streeters can easily acquire these credit default swaps, but distrust the salesman from the other brokerage house who is pushing them. The other two non-connected investors desperately want the same positions but have difficulty acquiring these new and thinly traded securities because they are not recognized by the banks on the other side of the trades.    In typical Lewis style he also profiles the cast of characters and malfeasant investment banks on the long side of the trades who mask the rising value of these thinly traded short securities for as long as they possibly can. My only criticism is that Mr. Lewis left out one chapter that I would have written.    That would be entitled: \\"Who was Resposible for This?\\" The answer that would unfold in its pages would be YOUR GOVERNMENT. The mortgage bond \\"machine\\" that blows up in Mr. Lewis' story is not unlike an internal combustion engine machine, which left to its own devices - unlimited air and fuel - will quickly blow itself up. It is the carburetor which prevents this from happening. The carburetor that was removed from the mortgage bond machine during the 1990s were the federal mortgage lending standards that were legislated in the 1930s to prevent future bank failures; long before Wall Street ever dreamed it could whip a home mortgage into a bond.    If I was to tell you the size of the losses I sustained holding long equity positions in Citigroup, Wachovia, National City Corp, among others during this meltdown; you might be suprised also to know that I walked away from this read feeling good. If you take the time to read the book for yourself, I think you will understand why.
B001R0KH3M|5.0|Stevie Wonder has been around so long that I was hardly surprised once to find his CDs sitting in an \\"Oldies\\" section of Tower Records.  Yet he's in the prime of his career.  That much is obvious from _Live at Last_, his live DVD from a 2008 concert in the U.K.  This is a superb showcase, demonstrating the length as well as the depth of Wonder's repertory, and also showing how beautifully he has reconstructed tunes originally written in the recording studio with synthesizers for a large band.   Indeed, these superb musicians--two drummers, two guitarists, keyboardists, horn section--are given a large chunk of space to solo on the Chick Corea tune \\"Spain\\"--which, along with Miles Davis's \\"All Blues,\\" constitutes two jazz tunes on this DVD.      But it is Stevie Wonder's songs that are so striking in this video.  From \\"My Cherie Amour\\" and \\"Signed, Sealed, Delivered (I'm Yours),\\" which date from the late 1960s, to tunes from his latest CD \\"A Time 2 Love,\\" this is an astonishing repertory--and one the audience knew well, as they responded to Stevie's frequent requests to sing along.  (The predominantly white audience--well, this *was* England--was gently needled by Stevie when they sang about being \\"nappy headed boys\\" on \\"I Wish.\\")  Two hours hardly seemed enough time to sample it.   The tunes are presented not in \\"greatest hits\\" medleys, but given full-length performances, often with new arrangements to accommodate the band.  I can't recommend a better overview of the work of an astonishing American composer.
B0000YEEHG|5.0|PERSONA is one of Ingmar Bergman's best remembered films & one  that solidified his reputation as a leading post-World War II film director. It also loosely codified his basic approach: Very theatrical, intimate & psychological--with a dab of surrealism..<br /><br />At the beginning of the film a psychiatric nurse is given the doctor's explanation of his patient's condition. We learn that she is an actress and that one night while she was playing ELEKTRA she suddenly froze. It was not stage fright, but rather the symptom of a deeply embeded conflict. It's interesting that the role of Elektra should be the catalyst for her neurosis as the play deals with the subject of family betrayal. Freud's theories of the Elektra Complex also factors in with its complex sexual & role dynamics.<br /><br />Next we see the actress in her hospital room & the TV is on, but she does not react to it. Suddenly a news item shows a monk in Saigon setting himself on fire as a protest to the corrupt regime in power. The actress jumps up and flings herself against a wall in silent hysterics. I interpreted this to signify that her crisis was not just personal, but also the sensitive reaction of a woman highly attuned to her environment & society.<br /><br />The nurse & her patient go to live in seclusion with the idea that this companionable relationship without any real committment & away from the collective negativity of society will enable the actress to heal & resumme her place in that same society. There are just two little problems: The patient IS an actress & the Nurse is a real person, not just a passive listener.<br /><br />A psychodrama plays out that is intense & often shocking.<br /><br />This film is an important archival & historic document.

I did a little homework and found out Elton had another 31 top forty hits during the years 1970-2002. That's a lot of material to leave out on a \\"greatest hits\\" release. I assume the reason for that was price, as a three CD collection would approach that of a box set. If you buy, or have bought this collection, you can expand it by downloading all those extra tracks from Amazon or various other websites. Then your \\"greatest hits\\" collection from EJ will be complete!

0399536108|5.0|As a long-time marketer currently searching for opportunities and having known the cubicle life for way too long, Chris' book has really inspired me to re-think my next ventures. As Chris mentions in the book, no self-help guru is going to be able to help us as much as we can help ourselves. Really soul-searching your passion and listening to what your gut tells you is the way to unconventional living. Conquering fear that resides within us is an arduous task, but we must work harder to trust ourselves and what's best for us.  No organization is ever going to do that! The Art of Non-Conformity forces you to look within yourself and realize that you have unique gifts and passions for a meaningful life that will help others along the way. Whether your passion is travel, family, business or other, this book drives home the same message - do what makes you passionate and live life on your terms.
0345404475|1.0|I absolutely hated this book.  It was just a little too weird for my tastes.  I'm more of a traditional Heinlein, Asimov, H.G Wells fan and I just didn't get it.  I know it is a popular book, I just can't understand why.

It is more about the big ideas and the people involved than the nuts and bolts mathematics which suited me just fine.

0553805371|3.0|I'm not going to lie. I feel a bit like a charlatan critiquing a book by Stephen Hawking. At the same time though, having actually read the book, it's kind of a disservice to even suggest that this touches [[ASIN:0553103741 The Illustrated Brief History of Time, Updated and Expanded Edition]] in terms of content or importance.<br /><br />The style of The Grand Design is entirely accessible to most readers. The tone itself takes an almost Vonnegut-esque \\"So here's why this is this. And so is that. And so is everything. So that's nice.\\" cadence, which I found enjoyable initially, but it became grating as the book progressed.<br /><br />Where I found the book lacking, though, is that there wasn't much of an \\"A ha!\\" moment to be had. And just as the tone got a bit annoying as the book progressed, some concepts were so watered down -- while maintaing that intonation, that it almost came across as though a pretentious lecturer had jumped in and taken over the writing. (I'll reserve judgement on whether or not Messrs Hawking and Mlodinow are, in fact, pretentious, having never heard a lecture of theirs.)<br /><br />As for the theological aspects that people are reading in to The Grand Design, I have to disagree. There isn't an obvious push for or against creationism, such that I'd question whether or not those making the Atheist case for / Christian case against The Grand Design have more of an agenda than the one they're either promoting or decrying.<br /><br />All things considered, I can see this as an interesting read for a high schooler who is getting in to physics and the origin of the universe, but I really question whether The Grand Design is a bit overly basic (for the most part) to anyone who graduated from high school

B000002OMN|5.0|This is overwhelming. By every meaning. It's not an easy listening album which you can listen to while doing anything else. If you do so it just sucks. You really have to sit down and do nothing but listen. Again LISTEN! And then make sure that there is noone who doesn't like loud music or use good headphones. And then turn the volume up! UP! UP! even more! So here you are and now turn on the music. I promise you, you will be overwhelmed... It is rich and intense, amazing piano and e-guitar playing and this great voice. It just gives you goosepimples... It begins with the most amazing song I've ever listened to. I'd do anything for love but I won'T do that... The song is as amazing as long its title is. It is orchestral and bombastic, it blows your mind. And so it goes on. Somehow the kind of music can be compared to the song \\"Music\\" by John Miles. If you know that multiply the feeling by 100 and you got what you get by listening to this album. It's really Meat Loaf at his best. It is no hardrock or classic rock it's more symphonical rock, and if you don't like it just don'T listen to it. But I bet you will like it!
B00382X4X2|5.0|Wow! Thats what I said to myself after the first listen to disc two of course. The great Hammersmith recording. The difference between this and live evil is live evil listening to it it seems to be recorded in the back row. Hammersmith sounds like you were in front of Dio!!Ilove live evil but this recording is unbelievable! When he sings the song black sabbath he owns that song its like theres two songs that are really great one with dio and one with the great ozzy! This is my first deluxe cd by sabbath , the next will be Paranoid 3 cd.

I suppose this doesn't speak very highly of me, but it showed me that I'm capable of being so much more.    I laughed.  I cried.    I didn't want it to end, but it really is the most complete story in film I've seen in awhile.
0895260131|1.0|While I have always appreciated the readers' reviews in selecting which books to read, I have rarely written my thoughts on a book until I read this one. First, I found it very difficult to read this book from the first page but in my pursuit of reading resources to gain different perspectives I managed to finish it.  I have never read a book with such ignorant, cherry picked, scholarly biased so-called investigation that seems to only aim distorting the truth with the goal of provoking hatred thoughts by providing such negative image of Islam and its followers. I consider myself as a moderate Muslim with secular perspective not only on the principles of Islam but also other religions. I have lived in US for 10yrs and since day one I have always tried to learn and understand more and more about the other religions as well as cultures to not only broaden my perspective but more importantly appreciate people as who they are and where they come from. While I certainly understand why Islam in today's world is perceived as a violent religion due to a minority of fanatics especially after Sep 11, this cannot and never should be attributed to 1 billion+ Muslims worldwide. While the terrorism and violence action of Islamic fundamentalists can never be justified within the context of religion and culture, the conservative fundamentalism has existed from the times of human origin in every religion and cultures including Christianity Crusades being a particular example of such, in contrast to what the author argues. This author, however, ignores all the other research published by notable and well-positioned authors and historians, and provides questionable resources to his research just to encourage that violence against Islam and Muslims should be the path to move forward.  Treating Islam or any other religion with intolerance and ignorance rather than addressing the conflicts objectively has not accomplished any harmonization between the civilizations throughout the history and certainly will not today while we are experiencing such conflicts regardless of the religious background. Overall, it's very depressing to see that some of the readers have found this book to be an objective resource for depiction of Islam and Muslims.and certainly will not today while we are experiencing such conflicts regardless of the religious background.

0553805371|3.0|I often have thought that a lay person needs only a few principles to evaluate a popular scientific publication.  First, note that scientists earn their living by observing and measuring the consequences of natural phenomena.  Second, scientists invent theories, models, or laws to predict the observed and measured consequences of natural phenomena.  Third, great theories predict consequences of natural phenomena that were not observed before the theory.  Finally, anything not covered by the first three principles is conjectural or belongs to philosophy.    Hawking, of course, knows these principles.  He, and his co-author, cannot resist the temptation to tweak the reader.  Most of what they discuss is philosophical, and they declare philosophy to be dead.  Of course, then, their book is almost certainly DOA.  Most scientific theories, even the great ones, are found to be wanting and are modified, eventually.  Nevertheless, the authors do a good job of defining models, theories, effective theories and laws.  All are invented by people, consciously or unconsciously.   The discussion of the human brain's model for vision is a nice example.    There is only one remaining question.  Is this book worth the money and effort to read?    Perhaps!  Hawking is one of the few scientists explaining science to lay people.  But don't expect a completely new viewpoint.  Lay persons can find all the individual topics (relativity, sum over histories, strings, generation of complexity and replication from simple rules using cellular automata, balancing positive and negative energy, creation myths) elsewhere.  There is currently nothing close to an adequate, tested theory that unifies gravity with the other forces, in spite of the magic words \\"M-Theory.\\"  The book itself is somewhat thin for the price, but can be read quickly and easily.  The illustrations are pretty.    The authors unfortunately must smooth over complex mathematical manipulations with verbosity.  Mathematics is not simply an engineering addition to science and technology.  It is not merely added to make science a little more precise.  Both language and math are properties of the human nervous system.  The math is absolutely essential for making possible a smooth communication of physical science.  Alas, the mathematical details of some theories, besides leading to final accurate predictions, show some peculiar intermediate interpretations such as multiple universes or multiple paths to a consequence.  A good mathematical expression of a theory is not necessarily, in detail, a phenomenological truth.    Enjoy this book, but don't expect to learn the final secrets of the Universe.  Your own philosophical beliefs are secure.

I like how much brighter it seems than the 1996 BBC version and the characters may not all be exactly as they are in the book, but they are all brilliant and work to together wonderfully.  At first I have to admit I didn't care for it much, but it grew on me in about the first half hour and now I think I prefer it to the older one.  Kate Beckinsale probably played the character more accurately but I thought she was a little lacking in energy.  Romola definitely is not.

0307454541|4.0|This book was really well written with incredible character development and huge intrigue.  It was at times a bit too violent and graphic for me and I don't think it needed that level of violence to deliver the story.

B00005JL0I|2.0|CASINO ROYALE -- 1967, reminds me very much of \\"Alice's Adventures In Wonderland\\".  Only \\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\\" makes a great deal more sense.    This movie boasts an all-star cast: Peter Sellers, Ursula Andress, David Niven, Joanna Petite, Dahiah Levi- and Woody Allen.  In featured supporting roles are Deborah Kerr, Charles Boyer, William Holden, John Huston, George Raft, and Kurt Kazner.  Others appearing in featured roles are: Gabriella Lucidi, Tracy Reed, Tracy Crisp, Elaine Taylor and Angela Sinclair. The four separate segments, (featuring four separate \\"James Bonds\\"), were directed by four different directors, including John Huston and Val Guest.     I listend to the \\"Making-Of\\" featurette, featuring director Val Guest, before watching either of the two \\"Casino Royale\\" versions included in this DVD -- and I am very glad I did.  Amongst other things Mr. Guest revealed is that the main feature, (the colour, 1967, theatrical version of Casino Royale), was based on the novel, \\"Casino Royale\\" by Ian Fleming in the very, very loosest way.  In fact, all they had of the novel was the title, and the sets.  The story -- such as it is -- was entirely made up and written for this movie.    This helps make SOME sense of the four stories within the 1967 film.  They have four different James Bond, and four different stories.  The first story, with David Niven, is full of stereotypes of Scottish people, running through a large, dark castle, people falling from being poisoned, people running through large areas of land, and sexual innendos.  It co-stars Joanna Petite as \\"Mata Bond\\", the supposed daughter of James Bond and Mata Hari, (talk about making a talkie film seem like it should have been made in the silent era!)  Ms. Bond gets involved in a weird spy-school, and the showing of a film....  Don't ask.  Even David Niven, (and even beautiful Ms. Pettet can't save it, either.)    The second part stars Peter Sellers as James Bond.  He is such a famous spy, that people ask for his autograph.  (Talk about realism in movies!  Famous spys are ALWAYS asked for their autographs in real life, of course!)  This segment also features Orson Wells -- who for some reason performs a magic trick involving the levitation of a \\"Princess Aiesha\\"....a segment he repeated, (if my memory is correct), on a segmemnt of the \\"I Love Lucy\\" show!  Even Orsen Wells can't save this part of the movie.    I am not wasting my time watching the other two segments, (or is it three?)  This movie is supposed to be \\"the ultimate psychedolic secret agnet satire.\\"  Well, as far as psychedolic goes, it is SO mixed-up, SO confusing, with stories SO bad, that it should really be shown in every drug-recovery program! This movie is to real spies as going to Kindergarten has to do with studying the finer points of constitional law.  And it is NOT a satire.  It is a farce, with a very few satirical elements, (such as calling one of the characters, \\"Dr. Noah\\"), thrown in.    I saw this movie when it first came out, and wonder now how I --and the rest of my family -- were able to sit through it.  I wonder how ANYONE could have sat -- and can sit -- through it.  Full of totally implausible, ridiculous and, yes, quite stupid segments.  Where does it all lead?  To all the characters getting killed?  Or imprisoned? (A la 'Seinfeld'?)  Or discovering that the entire movie was a dream, (A la 'The Bob Newhart Show'? Or a famous season-end cliff-hanger of \\"Dallas\\"?)  Or another, equally contrived ending?  To tell which -- if any -- of these are the ending would be to spoil this movie for those who haven't yet had the excruciating esperience of watching it.  But then, this movie spoils itself from beginning to end.    There are only TWO reasons to even borrow this DVD out of the library.  One is the truly upbeat, innovative, tuneful and memorable music by BURT BACHARACH.  His music seems to breathe life into even the dullest, most boring and most hackneyed scenes.  Watching thismovie shows how important movie music can be!    The other reason is the inclusion in this disc of the 1954, black and white \\"CLIMAX' version of \\"Casino Royale\\".  The story here has real suspense, good acting, and, (most important of all), a story which is followable!  Starring the late Barry Nelson, the late Peter Lorre, and the radiant Linda Christian, (the very FIRST 'Bond Girl\\" -- who, at this writing, is a happily alive 83 years old!), it shows the difference between a \\"trying-to-be farce\\", and a good, solid suspense story.  Watching this segment is a true pleasure, and shows it's not how much money one spends that counts, (this episode of a TV-Anthology series, filmed in black and white, obviously cost FAR less than the extravagant colour theatrical movie of thirteen years later) -- it's the quality of the writing that counts.  ALL the actors in the 1967 version try SO hard to make the movie work -- but with a story and script that sabotage their every effort, all their hard work is hopeless.    So see this disc for the music and the \\"Climax\\" segment.  Despite the dizzying psychedelia of the main movie, these two things will keep you entertained and grounded, and realizing that 1) there really IS some talent in the entertainment world, and 2) there is no need to think that everything is getting \\"curiouser and curiouser\\".  Some things ARE good in life, still.  All one must do is seek them out!

0385340575|3.0|Lee Child can write.  He creates suspense.  He can weave interesting factoids (the eleven signs of a suicide bomber, for one) into his work in a way that adds to the tension rather than distracting from it.  He does action with the best.  He can impress us with Reacher's ability to figure things out.  But (you knew that was coming, didn't you?) in Gone Tomorrow he does all this in a story that simply does not hang together.      [Warning - spoilers ahead.]  We meet a woman convincingly in the role of the wife of a Russian billionaire: excellent English, sophisticated manner.  She's twenty six.  When we discover her actual history...there just wasn't time for her to get that polish.  We have an obvious Clue: \\"600-82219D\\" is written on a scrap of paper in a dead woman's car.  Everybody thinks it's a phone number. (Do you? Really??)  Our hero figures it out, which (maybe - I'm fuzzy on this) helps advance the action a bit.  But once you know Everything, you also know that there was no reason for that clue to exist in the first place; in fact, it was a red herring for Reacher and the reader.  Finally, we have an entire sleepless night in which Reacher, sought by the police and by evil (well, maybe they're evil - they certainly don't respect the Constitution) federal agents, dangles himself as bait for the purpose of, apparently, having some exciting escapes.    One thing I liked about the earlier Reacher books was Child's invitation to \\"think along with Reacher.\\"  In Gone Tomorrow I was disappointed by what I found when I did.    PS to Amazon: Chapel Hill is actually in North Carolina.  No wonder my orders take so long.  [ :-) actually my orders arrive just fine... ]

B002ZG98UA|2.0|Resident Evil is a movie franchise that is a perfect example of not just falling short, but almost missing the point entirely in comparison to its source material. While playing through the first two games, parts of the third, and owning the fourth (with Resident Evil 4 becoming a personal favorite), the games have always had a pretty solid storyline that always centered around a well developed and genuinely terrifying atmosphere; traits the films seem to completely overlook. Afterlife offers the same generic formula and changes nothing that was used in the three previous films.<br /><br />Truth be told, zombie cinema seems like it's pretty tapped out. Most zombie films these days revolve around a recycled idea or ideas that have been done at least half a dozen times previously. The Resident Evil films seem to be following the same trend at least as far as offering an entertaining experience is concerned.<br /><br />What did you think of the slow motion effect that was used in 300? Did you think it was pointless, overused, and overbearing? Well that's nothing in comparison to the slo-mo used in Afterlife. The beginning involving the girl standing in the rain, the plane wreck with Wesker and Alice, and the fight scene in the shower involving Ali Larter are the biggest examples that come to mind. The effect seemed to be used more for when people were in the process of looking up or turning around rather than when they were shooting a zombie in the head (which it's used for at one point and is the only time the effect really felt like it was needed) or something actually worth the trouble of putting into slo-mo.<br /><br />Logic seemed to be completely thrown out the window, as well. Alice had become human again, but walked away from a plane wreck and flew through the air in fight scenes in ways that would make Neo from The Matrix jealous. Or what about the way she landed her plane on that rooftop? How the survivors kept her plane from falling to the ground below? At times, the film managed to be even more ridiculous and over the top than both The Expendables and Machete.<br /><br />The few good things about the film seemed to borrow an awful lot from other films and TV shows. The coolest idea in the film is the way Alice uses quarters, but it'll just end up reminding you of Scott Pilgrim. The best fight scene takes place in the shower with Claire and Axeman, but both her and Alice are accomplishing things most humans could only dream of. Afterlife seemed to borrow ideas from the Dawn of the Dead remake (HELP US!), The Boondock Saints (Wesker's \\"death\\"), and even \\"Beetleborgs\\" (those weird bug things on their chests). Not to mention the fact that EVERYONE had to talk the way Christian Bale talked as Batman in Christopher Nolan's Batman films. The extremely large man who carried the axe was apparently from Resident Evil 5 even though his name was altered a bit in the film. If you haven't played RE5 though, you'll probably draw the comparison between Axeman and Pyramid Head from Silent Hill. Since the film franchise has strayed further and further away from the source material, it just seems odd that they'd replace that with what seems like borrowed ideas from other popular franchises.<br /><br />Resident Evil: Afterlife is just another tiring sequel to what is another exhausted movie franchise. If it wasn't for the fact that it's not only in 3D but actually filmed in that format, then the whole trip would be pretty pointless in the long run.

I really enjoy Audley Freed's playing, and considering that his guitar work has been relatively rarely recorded, it makes this CD set even more valuable (you MUST purchase the two Cry of Love CD's from the early-to-mid 90's if you haven't already...great playing and great songs by Freed throughout)! Little Milton gets a long overdue chance to shine on a few songs here, and he really cuts loose on the guitar--not staid and laid-back like I thought he would be. I love the cover tunes the band picked out like Power of Love and Dazed and Confused. Warren really tore it up, especially on the vocals to \\"Dazed\\". I couldn't really tell what he was doing on the breakdown passage of that one...playing with a bow? It was pretty cool, but I think the song lost a little momentum there, it just didn't seem to flow as smoothly as the Zeppelin version on Song Remains The Same. But hey, it's all good--they're just paying tribute, anyway! :-)    It's great to hear Woody again, tearing it up on the bottom end. In fact, it would have been nice to hear him more. There is absolutely NO \\"oomph\\" to the bass EQ on this recording. What happened?? The Roseland Ballroom CD sounded GREAT--why couldn't this one have sounded at least just as good? Overall, it is good, but just a little murkier, I think, than the Roseland, and again, NO BASS. Well actually, you can hear the bass guitar rather easily, but you sure as heck can't feel it. Crank up your subwoofer! If you're like me and are too poor or don't have the space for one in your car, you're out of luck. Still, it's not worth passing up this CD set over it--it's still enjoyable to listen to and still sounds better than your average live recording. Just disappointed with the lack of bass. grrrrr...    Overall, an indispensable addition to your Mule collection, and for blues-rock fans in general!
B002HFP0QU|5.0|This may be of little value to many readers, but it will make sense to those collecting Bee Gees music.  These two discs were released by Reprise (a division of Warner Brothers Recording studio).  Another set of 4 CDs will be released shortly (as of the writing of this) called \\"Anthology\\" and that set is from Rhino records.  I attempted to send the corrections to Amazon twice, but the automated system didn't seem to understand what I entered.  In any case, there is a BIG difference between the number, order and variety of songs on Anthology and those on Ultimate, so I recommend that you check them both out before you buy.  I thoroughly enjoy this CD set and will probably also purchase the Rhino set as well.  Again, this is for those who might be misled by the stated label on this listing.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|I keep waiting for Pixar to crank out a dud.  Sooner or later these guys have to mail one in, don't they?  But as I see trailers for seemingly dubious films - a rat who wants to be a chef?  an old man tying balloons to his house?  a sequel starring Tim Allen? - I find myself being sucked in by the sheer brilliance of the storytelling and the enchanting visual sights of the studio's animation.    And so it came as little surprise that I found myself tearing up during the tale of a lovable little garbage processor named Wall-E.    In many ways, \\"Wall-E\\" is the studio's most ambitious effort to date.  In our star-obsessed movie culture, here is a major motion picture without a recognizable star.  Our movies are increasingly action-and-info-packed, with quick one-liners hyper-edited into fantastic action scenes spliced together of moments that take less than a second, and yet \\"Wall-E\\" opens with a languid 25-minute stretch with little action and no dialogue.  And for an industry that is designed to cater to its audience, here is a movie that not-too-subtly insults the audience as it sits passively, swilling gallons of soda and inhaling millions of calories worth of popcorn and candy.     And yet it works - this is one of the most original and delightful movies of the last five years.  Wall-E, who is seemingly a combination of ET and R2D2, is a hero for our age - the definitive little guy who goes after a girl completely out of his league and who gets a chance to save civilization in the process.    Look elsewhere for a regurgitation of the plot or key points - this is a movie to be experienced and savored.  Get a copy today.
1439181780|4.0|This is a fine book to introduce the beginner to the concept of using the vibration of emotion to create the life you wish to live.  There is a book I read ten years ago that is a permenant fixture in my library: \\"Excuse Me, Your Life is Waiting : The Astonishing Power of Feelings\\" by Lynn Grabhorn.   That book introduced me to the concept, with much success, I'm happy to add.    \\"The Power\\" is fine to start, but definitely follow up with \\"Excuse Me, Your Life is Waiting.\\"  Then, study Ester Hicks' Abraham book \\"The Astonishing Power of Emotions: Let Your Feelings Be Your Guide\\" to really bring it home.  Your life will never be the same after that.

1416596097|4.0|Le Carre is one of my favorite authors and I was not disappointed with this addition to his long list of novels. I couldn't put it down. The story takes place in Germany and is told from the point of view of several characters. It reveals the convoluted approach to dealing with a suspected terrorist. The \\"target\\" is an innocent in more ways than the obvious. The social worker helping him wants to have a rare success in her endeavors to help illegal immigrants. The intelligence officer and his associates are smart and well-intentioned, but overmatched by higher-ups. Other characters become collateral damage. The ending reflects contemporary \\"terrorist solutions\\".
0312370849|5.0|Very interesting book; highly recommended; intense; exciting; one can put it down to see what is the next episode; very good writing for all ages!!
0385737955|3.0|I really don't know what to think of this book. I am not going to go into what it is about because I think that will ruin it. I went in not knowing what in the world was going on and I liked it better that way, but I wish that authors would quit killing children for entertainment and thinking it is a great idea for a novel! What is wrong with these people! Don't get me wrong I loved Hunger Games (even though it is sick and wrong), but I hope this isn't the newest trend. Do as many werewolves or vampire novels you want, but lets stay away from the death of children especially when it isn't necessary.    I did like the premise of the book and thought it was somewhat original. In the beginning I didn't want to put it down because I wanted to know what was going on and you want that in a book. I just had a issue towards the end when I had a feeling of where this book was heading especially in regards to the character Chuck. I do like Tom the main character. I am glad he isn't a robot or his emotions aren't as robotic as Katniss's seemed at times. The girl in the novel Teresa I am not sure how I feel about her. I wish the author would of spent more time on developing her emotionally, so that I care what happens to her and I also wish I had more information on why she is important within the story, but maybe that will show itself in the next book.    I gave it 3 1/2 stars not because I didn't like the book because I hope that there is a reason for all the potential death and destruction that I see happening within this series and I hope the author doesn't drag it out into a long series. I don't know if I can handle that. I did like the way author explained what is going on in the book and I think he did well at making this believable and understanding what exactly is happening to these kids, so you are just as scared as they are. My rant is over :) well almost. I love that teen books are capturing people's attention. I am glad that people have begun to start reading againas a past time and I hope that this trend will continue just stop with the death! I also hope the love story in this book develops more in the next one because this book needs something happy to happen in it!
630428540X|5.0|This is an important movie.  It speaks of the power we each have within us.  It also shows how often people choose not to use it.  But I don't want to spoil it for those who haven't yet seen it.    It's an excellent script, very well made and presented. John Travolta gives a fine performance, as do his costars.    See it.  Listen to it.  Think about it.  Then see it again and think about it some more.  Perhaps you may become a phenomenon.
0373774184|5.0|Venetia and Jasper are great main characters. One has a wicked past while the other is pure and innocent. In the beginning I wasn't sure if I would like Jasper with all his rakish ways, but he really grows on you and by the end of the book I would of taken him off Venetia's hands!    I really loved this book. This is by far my favorite Georgette Heyer books that I have read so far. I loved all the characters especially her brother who I would love if he had a story, but I don't think he does. Her suitors are all opposites of each other and it is funny the way they interact. Most of all the hero and heroine just make me laugh and I loved reading their discourse throughout the book. There really never is a dull moment in this book. I was sad when I was done with it!
B003BKF696|5.0|I heard \\"Bloodbuzz Ohio\\" on WFUV 90.7 New York and thought this was the best male lead voice since Bono of U2. After listening to samples of\\"High Violet\\" on Amazon I bought the album which exceded my expectations. These guys are comparable to The Muse in creating a very sophisticated sound.
B003MOHX8S|5.0|Intense and ground shaking works. If your needing something for non-commercial short film tracks these will work. Want some fun fantasy music in your RPG games this will help out. These will causes a surge of energy in different tracks that wants you to pounce on orcs and save the damsel in distress! I listen to these at work and the repeat button is getting worn out:-p
B002RWKSII|5.0|It's fascinating that the majority of reviews for this album are five stars or one star.  Because it is probably neither.  A five-star album should be perfect, and this album is not.  But it is an immensely enjoyable, satisfying, and often inspiring production and performance by Brian Wilson and his band, with no small amount of its success due to the Gershwin brothers' incredible talents.<br /><br />It seems as if somebody giving this album a one-star rating must have a private agenda, because there is simply no way it is a failure in any respect.  Brian's voice is incredibly strong throughout most of the tracks, although it's not always perfect.  You can hear a few slurs and intonation problems, but let me hear you sing when you're his age.  Many of the vocals are near-flawless, and if you compare them with some of his recent work, this is a major improvement.  I simply can't explain anybody hating this album or faulting Brian's vocals.  If you want to nitpick, he didn't even sing perfectly on \\"Hushabye\\" or \\"I Just Wasn't Made For These Times.\\"  But that doesn't make them any less classic.<br /><br />I think that some of those giving it five stars would probably want to give it four-and-a-half stars for not being flawless, and I'd probably be in that group.  I would probably give it a solid four-star rating, but as I feel the need to cancel out one of those ridiculous one-star ratings, five stars it will get from me.<br /><br />The plusses for me are many, including production touches and arrangements that are as uniquely satisfying as the best of Brian's work.  Not all are gems, and those that aren't you can't really criticize as being bad -- they're just not as unique as you want to hear from Brian.  But they do add variety to the album, and that was obviously one of Brian's intents.  That's why we have doo-wop, samba, Beach Boys, and other styles.  Really the only weak track in terms of production is \\"The Can't Take That Away From Me,\\" and it's too bad, because this track was so close to being a classic.  But the rough-edged performance and production, while probably intentional to again add some variety, reminds me of the Beach Boys' \\"Breakaway.\\"  A brilliant song and arrangement, but this one needed a to be redone and have all the \\"looseness\\" removed.  It ends up sounding too much like a PARTY! track and not a Brian Wilson masterpiece.  Another couple of days in the studio tightening everything up would have put this in the category of the best songs on this album.<br /><br />My least favorite songs are from the PORGY AND BESS medley, but that's more due to my personal taste than anything else having to do with these tunes being my least favorite Gershwin songs.  Brian's performances are surprising, but well-thought-out.  His instrumental approach to \\"I Got Plenty O'Nuttin'\\" would be brilliant except for the fact that it sounds like a PET SOUNDS outtake, as it was obviously meant to be.  But this is over forty years after PET SOUNDS, and I think Brian could have taken it to the next level rather than giving us a rehash of PET SOUNDS.  But maybe he just wanted to do that for whatever reason.  But I'll always prefer that Brian give us something new rather than to simply rehash something, no matter how good that original was.<br /><br />If the album only had \\"Rhapsody in Blue,\\" \\"The Like in I Love You,\\" \\"I Got Rhythm,\\" \\"Someone to Watch Over Me,\\" and \\"Nothing But Love,\\" it would be a classic album.  I simply never get tired of listening to these, and the two \\"collaborations\\" make me wish we had gotten an album of nothing but such creations on this album.  Brian was faced with an interesting challenge on \\"I Got Rhythm,\\" since the Happenings already did their brilliant Beach Boys/doo-wop take on the song long ago.  What he came up with was different, yet what one would have hoped for giving the sentiment of the song and how perfectly it fits into Brian's more traditional \\"California/Fun, Fun, Fun\\" mode.<br /><br />So there it is.  Not a perfect album, but a perfectly listenable and enjoyable one.  What this has done is make me look forward to the Disney songs album 100 times more than I thought I would before hearing the Gershwin release.  But the two \\"new\\" songs also make me look forward to the next totally original Brian Wilson project.  When you realize where Brian was back in the 1970s and 1980s, it is absolutely unfathomable that he is where he is today.  He is the train wreck that never happened.  The lost cause that somehow rediscovered himself, his Muse, his sanity, and has given the world of music something nobody in their right mind ever would have believed could have happened.  There are so many geniuses who have fallen prey to their own gifts, and who have left us wondering what might have been.  With Brian, what might have been has miraculously occurred.  Brian's not always perfect, but if you listen to the old Beach Boys albums, he wasn't always perfect then, either.  But a Wilson who's perfect 75% of the time is more rewarding and musically invigorating than nearly anybody operating at their very best.stenable and enjoyable one.

I cannot believe that anyone could give this less than 5 stars, but I read some of the reviews given by people who rated it 1 star and all I am ask is \\"Did you read the same book that I did???\\" I would give this book 10 stars if it were possible.<br /><br />The way in which Max writes pulls you into the story and you feel like you are there on the front lines of the war against the Z's.

0525951652|5.0|Honestly, what more can I say?  I loved this book and can't believe I have to wait a year (or more) to read the next book.  As with any sprawling story, it was hard at first to keep track of all the characters and their plotlines and some interested me much more than others.  Follett kept the coincidences and interaction between the characters believable....he did not force their stories to intertwine.  I wish I were more knowledgeable about this period of history so that some of the more \\"technical\\" sections made more sense, but that did not really keep me from enjoying the story.

B00005K3NR|5.0|(this review may contain spoilers. Read at your own risk) Here comes CARRRIE! Actually, I feel sorry for Carrie. Anyway, this is a movie about a girl who gets tortured by her classmates and her crazy Catholic fundementalist mother and then developes telekinesis over the years. At prom night, she's been embarrassed for the last time and takes out her revenge!! Soon, Carrie White brought down the house(litterally!) and kills her mother. I wonder how those who survived Carrie's rage got out of the burning school? Out of the pages of Stephen King's novel, Carrie is the movie that will make bullies think twice before they pick on nerdy kids! Starring Sissy Spacek as Carrie White, Piper Laurie as Magaret White, John Travolta as Billy Nolan, Nancy Allen as Chris Hargesen, and Amy Irving as Sue Snell! So go ahead \\"TAKE CARRIE TO THE PROM. I DARE YOU!\\".

0143118420|4.0|I think it is always good to read about someone's journey to better themselves, find balance and connect with God.  Gilbert's self-effacing and funny description of her journey was a bonus.  Her ability to be honest with herself about her faults is something we should strive for.<br /><br />I enjoyed reading the book because I would want to follow in her footsteps around the world.  Travelling Travelling Travelling.  But with my husband.  This is definitely at least 15% travel book, if you like that genre.<br /><br />I see this as a book about Ms. Gilbert growing up, figuring out who she is and building character.  In order to do this, she did demonstrate poor integrity (abandoning her hubbie) but, it seems she would have done that regardless of whether she went on to \\"find herself\\" later or not.<br /><br />What's good is that she realized she needed to work on herself instead of blaming it on him and then jumping from man to man, citing their flaws for her inability to stay and breaking hearts in the process.<br /><br />She takes responsibility for the fact that she is a mess and needs to grow.  I can't help but respect that.<br /><br />Her three destinations aren't just three escapist extended vacations so she can hide from the damage she's done in the states.  She pursues three different styles of quests for truth and happiness in the process (as represented by Italy, India and Bali).<br /><br />I don't know anybody that read this and didn't thoroughly enjoy it.  I will say though that in the movie version, she came off as much more selfish.  I think this is because, in the book, she is racked by guilt over leaving her husband.  I don't think she forgives herself until India and after alot of hard work.  In the movie, I think it was difficult to convey that up front.  So, movie viewers were left with the first impression that she was cold-hearted and flighty and the quest for truth was an afterthought.  It is hard to overcome that perception even though she laterinvests a great deal of energy into becoming a better person.  Readers will probably enjoy the book and, therefore like the author, more than in the movie due to this difference.
0374158460|5.0|I could not put this book down during my nine hour flight. I was in fact disappointed we landed in JFK and couldn't continue reading. I will only echo what the other reviewers said. Incredible and life changing novel that is perhaps the best I've read in a decade.
0670021652|4.0|As a newlywed, I found myself struggling with my new role as a wife.  What does it mean to be a wife?  What does it mean to be married?  What have I done in getting married?      I'm not clueless.  I'd been in a happy relationship with my hubbie for several years prior to getting married.  And, over the course of my life, I read alot of books on marriage and relationships well before I married, self-help addict that I am.  Its just that I suddenly felt very constrained by my commitment - like I'd lost all my independence and the freedom to create any life I wanted for myself.  And, I was quite conflicted about these feelings given my love for my great husband.  I was also surprised by them.    Having read Eat, Pray, Love and loved it, I thought I would get something out of this book.  And what a SOMETHING it was!      Through Gilbert's exploration of marriage in history, in other cultures, in previous generations of her own family, she comes to the conclusion that marriage can be whatever you make it.  And, in her interviews of married women throughout her research, she found that although some felt they had lost one path in life, most were quite happy with the one they had gained.  The specific examples she gives and the insights she shares are just the ones I needed to hear.      The book empowered me to view my marriage with fresh eyes.  It was a liberating relief.    What's more - I was intrigued by a reference she made to a book called \\"America's Love Lab\\" and am now enjoying reading that.      I'd love to read a book by Ms. Gilbert about her first year as a married woman.
B00000DHZJ|2.0|This would be a fine introduction to Hendrix's output or a sufficient single album for mild fans if not for the bad sound quality.    Unfortunately, when Hendrix's albums were re-released on CD in the late 1990's the re-mastering included extensive digital dynamic range compression, clipping and distortion that made the new versions unpleasant listens compared with older releases of the albums.  This compilation is no exception.  The volume of the recording is turned up -- but not in a good way -- and there seems to be some added digital distortion. (As if the extensive analog distortion in the original recordings weren't enough!  In any event, if you're baffled as to why a record company would release a CD that sounds so awful, go to Wikipedia and look up the article entitled \\"loudness war.\\")  I own this collection as well as older CD pressings of two Hendrix albums; the difference between the sound of the songs on this album and the sound of the same songs on the older albums is noticeable.  If you've listened to this album and think I am overstating the matter, I strongly recommend listening to Hendrix on a CD issued prior to 1997 or vinyl pressing -- you will be surprised at the difference.    Fortunately, some of the early 1990's MCA pressings of Hendrix's albums are still available used.  They're not perfect, but they have much better sound than this and won't give you a headache if you listen to them on a decent pair of headphones or speakers.  And if you're looking for a best-of collection, try the out-of-print MCA compilation with a similar set of songs called \\"[[ASIN:B000002OOG Ultimate Experience]].\\"  I have not heard it but I would be willing to wager that it does not suffer from the clipping that plagues this release.
B002B43AM8|5.0|This album (vol 1) came out by itself at the time i graduated from high school in Msy 1962.  I asked everyone for this album for my graduation present and received 3 copies.  I wore out all 3 by the fall of 1962.  As I could I replaced the album.  Then for a while I could not find it.  When it came out in CD (about 15 years ago) I bought it and several copies to give friends.  If you like country & western, R&B, soul and blues, I promise you will love this album.  My favorite song on the CD is Born to Lose.  I loved Take These Chains From My Heart in the subsequent album.  FYI, Rhino released a 4 vol. set called \\"Complete Country & Western Recordings - 1959-1986\\" that has the songs from the first two sets plus many other songs.  GET IT.

B000002ADT|5.0|An album can be a classic for many reasons. It made a contribution to music. It was the first of its kind. It historically represents an era in music, and in our world.<br /><br />Our world is now one of over exposure. We can hear and buy any music, any time. And as more musical cleche's are repeated, we hear their sources, and say \\"So wh..........\\" Let's get back to that<br /><br />Kind Of Blue by Miles Davis is over fifty years old. So much jazz has come from it, it sounds like so much jazz. But go back to Kind Of Blue and it sounds like jazz of the ages. Jazz of the ages that could have made yesterday. Today. Tomorrow.<br /><br />Miles Davis worked with Charlie Parker in the late 1940s and by the start of the next decade was a fixture in jazz. But he was not happy with being a fixture--being an inventor was more his style. After going home in 1954 to get better from the heroin addiction that killed so many of his contemporaries, he rolled up his sleeves and went to work.<br /><br />Ironic that his work was the polar opposite of the harmonically complex be-bop he cut teeth on. Kind Of Blue is the essence of simplicity. Play carefully in a few chords. Make less everything.<br /><br />Listen to \\"So What,\\" perhaps this master's signature piece. This soft masterwork is two chords, separated only by a semitone. The soft dynamics and perfect solos of Davis, John Coltrane and Cannonball Addrerly fill the space, using it perfectly. There is actually plenty of complexity, invention, but it is provided by the amazing ability of these musicians to improvise, hold back, shape the space.<br /><br />Listen again and my technicalities will mean nothing. \\"So What\\" is a walk in the park, hot day ice water. Its progression  so logical, it is inevitable. Music of perfect ease. Floating.<br /><br />\\"Freddie Freeloader,\\" \\"Blue Is Green,\\" these are blues, and at three or four chords each, the most complex compositions on Kind Of Blue. Can you believe that? It makes more sense considering that it is not the simplicity, but how sublime these players make the simplicity sound.<br /><br />I could name other tracks, but it is the premise that the whole album works on--exploring all the possibilities of a few chords-that makes Kind Of Blue vital.<br /><br />You can listen as background, you can listen as musical education. You can listen as meditation. You can listen on so many levels at once, I am sure you can find those I have not-yet.<br /><br />But why do you listen? I don't know. So What?

But why do you listen? I don't know. So What? Just listen to Kind Of Blue.

0439023491|2.0|Synopsis<br />Katniss thought she was safe after surviving the Hunger Games. Little does she know that things will only get worse. President Snow blames her for bringing the country to the brink of rebellion, and lets her know that if she can't convince the country that she is really in love on the victory tour, more than her family's lives are at stake.<br /><br />Review<br />The Hunger Games trilogy has been our road trip soundtrack this year. I enjoyed the first book as it had quite a bit of action, and Katniss' depression and confusion was understandable. Catching Fire picks up where Hunger Games left off. Katniss has managed to not learn anything from her time in the games and constantly whines about being confused and not understanding any of the glaringly obvious events and clues happening around her. After about 4 hours of being trapped in the car with her whining, I simply wanted to beat her in the face. She is supposed to be a fairly capable 17 year old girl, not mentally incompetent.<br />I figured that the book would become interesting again after the new Hunger Games began, but the story simply continued with the theme of Katniss being confused in new locations.<br /><br />My Recomendation<br />This book is filled to the brim with angst. Unless you are continuing the series, skip it. I give it a 2/5 - If it happens to be around, it's OK.

0439023513|4.0|Synopsis<br />Katniss is now with the rebels and must decide if she is willing to become the face of the revolution. She may be out for President Snow's blood, but she also needs to figure out if the new government will be any better than the previous tyranny.<br /><br />Review<br />I enjoyed this book so much more than the second one. While there was more self-indulgent whining on the part of Katniss, the inclusion of a wider character base really fleshed out the story. If was also nice to see that some of Katniss' reactions were actually based on damage from the games and not just on her lack of a personality. I was actually moved to tears at one point due to the return of Buttercup and his interaction with Katniss. The series certainly wraps everything up by the end of the story, and I found the tone of the the conclusion to be very satisfying.<br /><br />My Recommendation<br />If you made it through Catching Fire, then this is your reward. Though be warned, the first few chapters are still a bit whiny. I give it a 4/5 - Wait for a sale/coupon.
B002ZCY7PU|5.0|Zachary Levi returns as the government's geekiest spy in the third season of Chuck. Chuck Bartowski was a simple Buy More computer expert, part of the \\"Nerd Herd\\", who accidentally uploaded the latest Intersect 2.0 to his brain. Now, Chuck doesn't just &lt;em>know&lt;/em> things, he has access to every kind of combat skill as well as other convenient skills. Chuck now as the potential to be a real spy. With the help of his handlers, Sarah and Casey, Chuck may have a chance. But Chuck's big heart may be holding him back from being the detached agent that the government wants him to be.<br /><br />Chuck and cast are back for another season of danger and suspense, and always plenty of laughs. The cast is solid. And the characters keep growing and developing. Just when I thought the show was getting stagnate, they upgrade Chuck to 2.0, giving the show a fresh new spin. I love the direction this latest season has gone. I hope the momentum continues. With a slew of fantastic special guest stars, this may be the best season yet.

B001GCUO5W|5.0|This is one of those films that I watched at my son's house under protest, but I must say, I enjoyed it immensely. Moody and suspenseful, \\"Shutter Island\\" held me entranced throughout. Although some have criticized it for being \\"predictable,\\" it is one of those films that are enjoyable precisely because the director--Martin Scorsese--has planted enough clues along the way so that the viewer can participate in solving the mystery as the scenario twists and turns to its creepy conclusion.  I began by disliking Leonardo Di Caprio's character, but the actor, who turns in a performance that is both creditable and ultimately moving, won me over by the end of the film. Ben Kingsley and Max von Sydow lend their usual touch of class to the proceedings.    The Blu-Ray format shows off the splendid cinematography, which ranges from almost impenetrable darkness to over-saturated hallucinatory colours. Hurricane-force winds and rains emphasize isolation and discomfort, both in the protagonist and the viewer, and images of chains and patterns of cages contribute an intense claustrophobia. I recommend \\"Shutter Island\\" for anyone who likes psychological puzzles and old gothic novels with locked rooms and doors irresistibly marked \\"Do Not Enter!\\"     You know you will.
B002G4FQI4|5.0|I have several CDs by George Benson which I enjoy, and Songs and Stories is no exception! I first heard \\"Living in High Definition\\" during our fall vacation in 2009. I immediately liked the song. Several others are great too, but I like the High Definition one the best. Mr. Benson has shown much talent over many years, and he's still doing a great job.

B002JCSWVG|2.0|Invictus is a failure in of the key elements of filmmaking: Make the audience care. As an American, this was going to be no easy task. We don't know the first thing about Rugby, Eastwood doesn't really present the sport well, and what's worse is that he doesn't really present the events well. I came into the film being interested in the subject after studying it, and what happened before the events of most of this movie. The movie spends all of 30 seconds on this, thus giving no real context on why this is all important. But if they'd done that, it would have been hard to be invested anyways. It's a sports movie, but it's not a sports movie, but it uses all the cliches of one. The result is a very fine balance the movie has to walk, but it ends up tripping over. When speaking of a portrayal of this subject matter, cheesy should NEVER be something you use to describe it at any point during the proceedings, but cheesy is the word I'd use here more times than not, especially when it comes to the music.<br /><br />There's a song called \\"Colorblind\\" that plays in the middle of the movie that gives us the heftiest dose of unintentional cheese. The song is exactly what you think it is. It's an inspirational song with the most insufferable lyrics ever conceived, with its chorus being \\"I'm colorblind!,\\" followed by African chants. This is supposed set the tone for an \\"important\\" scene, and it comes off as anything but. The same with the title song that plays over the credits. The music is just a metaphor for the film as a whole. Too heavy-handed and serious for its own good, when the film is made by a bunch of Americans.<br /><br />The cast is decent, but only headlined by two stars, and mostly unknowns for the rest. Matt Damon is a blank slate with a distracting accent. But Morgan Freeman highlights the film in a performance that just fits like a glove. Who's the most natural person in Hollywood to play Nelson Mandela? Morgan Freeman. And Freeman does very well in the role, even if the writing is far from top-notch.<br /><br />Overall, the great Nelson Mandela deserves a lot better than what this movie gives. Its tone is inconsistent and all over the place. It hold very little interest for the viewer. It's ineptly paced and it's just SO BLOODY LONG! Well, it's only 2 hours and 20 minutes, but it feels a lot longer. Sorry Eastwood, I just wasn't feeling this film, and I wasn't really a fan with what you did with it. Sorry, but this could have been a lot better, and I was hoping for more.ting is far from top-notch.    Overall, the great Nelson Mandela deserves a lot better than what this movie gives.

0765348276|4.0|This book was very fun to read.  It has been a while since I read a book that made me care about the characters as mush as this book did.    The book is basically a fun retelling of Heinlein's Starship Troopers.  As much as that last line sounds like an accusation of plagiarism, let me assure you that is not my intent.  Where Heinlein's story was a vehicle for lectures on society, this one is a story about the characters.  The book goes in a totally different direction and accomplishes its goal quite well.
0553805371|4.0|I enjoyed this book. It flows easily and difficult concepts are given in terms anyone can get if they want. But many here just don't want to get them. Reviews with questions like \\"Why would anyone assume a particle goes thru both slits as well as all possible other paths simultaneously? That doesn't make sense!\\" seems to have missed the fact (and the many reiterations in the text) that this is QUANTUM physics, not Newtonian Physics or even Relativity. They even explain how this ca-razy \\"many paths\\" idea explains Newtonian Physics on our scale... with pictures!     How did any reader miss that?    Because each page is chocked full of info.... much can be overlooked. Some more leisurely details might be in order.    The best thing about the book is how the authors go thru what was thought in times past, how those notions led to more and more precise models.... throwing out the models that were shown to be untrue or lacking in precision. This is something Religion does not do and the very mechanism that makes Science hugely successful and useful. Reviewers still trying to force the square pegs of old ideas into the round holes of Quantum Physics are just not paying attention. They are missing the repeated statements in the book reminding them that these things are \\"true\\" because they were verified by MATHEMATICS, not hashed out in some smoky lounge full of deep thinkers. And that these quantum formulations INDEPENDENTLY confirm the very same notions Newtonian and Relativity models confirmed.... only more accurately.    Apparently though, they didn't say it enough. I coulda gone for a longer, more detailed book. But of course, there are those who find it a badge of honor to stand on their high horse and call it all hogwash.    I suggest also watching a lecture that goes well with this book, explaining the same things. It's on YouTube:    [...]

B0006PV5VC|3.0|After reading the reviews for this CD, I was expecting something that would knock me over.  It's OK.  Great?  Spectacular?  Not even close.  I love this piece, but not this presentation.  Far too tame for my liking.  Where was the spirit and excitement?  Really, I'd classify this as a \\"yawn.\\"
B002XZ62HK|5.0|I love this CD - purchased it a month or more ago - and have listened to nothing else but this CD in my car since I got it.   It's beautiful.  Every song is wonderful.   It's the best CD I've ever purchased - ever. I'm so sorry Alex is no longer with the group.  Her voice is precious on this and the DVD.   Chloe is, of course, an Angel in disguise, as is her voice. The others are great as well.       I highly recommend it.
B001W63DXC|5.0|This is one of the greatest live CDs of all time. Metal fans will love it, Maiden fans will break whatever is around them. The whole thing is amazing, it's a must-have, period.<br /><br />(I also have the DVD, but this CD never leaves my car and the rip never leaves my iPod)
B003TJ4YU6|5.0|If you're here looking at this DVD chances are the Beatles on the Ed Sullivan Show is meaningful to you. This is ground zero for modern Rock music, sure Elvis popularized Rock `n Roll, but this is where everything switches from singles to Albums and later to an Art form. The performances speak for themselves; the Boys are in fine form and in spite of the antiquated, very primitive sound system they sound great. This new version of the Beatles on Ed Sullivan DVD has been improved, the picture is brighter and a bit more clean, the 5:1 surround sound is quite good. If you're playing this through a surround sound system, the subwoofer handles the bass parts very nicely with little or no audible rumble, the vocals are clear and the overall presentation is quite remarkable especially considering the circumstances. A must buy for anyone of a certain age who wants to bask in the glory of the old days, and for newcomers who want to see what the fuss was all about. If you have the original SOFA release and you don't have a surround sound sytem, the old version will suffice, if you've got the Surround Sound, then spring for the new one, it's worth the investment. You shoulda been there.

0545123283|4.0|This story is told from the perspectives of four different characters, which can be a little hard to get used to at first.  The story is largely an internal conflict and doesn't carry much suspense, but I still couldn't put it down.  I wanted to know more about the characters and their experiences, and just the entire werewolf mythology the author has created is very compelling.  The romance can be a little boring, but only because it's very realistic, which is something that is refreshing to read.  The author has a knack for creating very realistic and believable situations and dialogue.  I love Steifvater's writing and I look forward to the next book in the series.
B000268QB2|5.0|I have never had an album put me in a better place as much as Hopes and Fears by Keane. Simply amazing. I never get tired of listening to it. I can not believe this is the same band that released Night Train. The piano, soaring vocals and just brilliant lyrics and melodies are unmatched in today's music. If you do not own this album. Please buy it as soon as possible. I particularly like Bedshaped. Plaintive and beautiful.The ex keane fan is for Night Train and Perfect Symmetry to a lesser degree.

The Way of Kings, was a great start to what I imagine is going to be an amazing journey. It is one of those books that immediately captures you and does not let go even long after you have finished. I am excited to find out what more Sanderson has in store for us. He is truly an epic writer of epic stories.If you have yet to have the pleasure of reading any of his books, I highly recommend that you start now.

It had everything drama, suspense, romance. really well done great cinematography. Great store. I highly recommend this movie, very moving
B0029F21BA|1.0|I felt that this movie was more commercial product than an earnest attempt at art or at entertainment.  The twists and turns of plot were manipulative and trite to the extent that they made the characters appear less believable; therefore much of the acting talent was wasted.  When the movie finally ended I felt that I had been cheated. With the advent of the blu-ray edition I offer a caveat for those who seek memorable characters and meaning in film; otherwise I would not bother.
B003J27WFW|5.0|This is such an AMAZING movie. It was only release in limited areas and for a limited time period. I bought it for my husband who is a MAJOR RUSH fan since he was little. The movie was AWESOME. I enjoyed watching it as much as he did. You get to see interviews with all 3 members, how their music is created and things they went through throughout their careers. I would definitely recommend this movie!!!
B0000028M7|4.0|I see some talent in the music industry today,however, nothing can compare to the 90's, nothing can replace the impact the bands like AIC, STP, The Offspring, or Green day had. I love this CD and cannot believe that some people have the nerve to bad-mouth Layne for his habits, he is a true artist in my eyes and this CD reflects the pain his past, present, and future held. How ignorant people are today to talk crap when this artist died, anybody that died deserves nothing more than grateful recognition, they lived, they died just like everyone else. R.I.P. Layne.

B000FVNX2Q|2.0|My first encounter with the HP 12C was many, many years ago as a gift from my manager.  I admit having up to that time only used a Casio calculator and hence not being aware of the RPN system that the calculator uses at first aggravated me no end as I tried with great difficulty to execute simple commands using that notation.  Over the years though once I got used to it, I actually prefer the RPN and so when I got this HP 12C Platinum Edition to replace my old 12C I still stuck to using the RPN despite this ability now to revert to the old way that I was initially used to when using my Casio calculator.  That HP 12C was a real workhorse and although by today's standards the computing speed (especially for IRR calculations) is really slow, the overall sturdiness and wonderful construction made it a trusted companion at work and during my exams e.g. my CFP and CPA exams.  That gift was made in Malaysia and lasted me almost 15 years.  The buttons had a nice feel to it and even the batteries lasted a long time.<br /><br />When it finally died, I decided to get a new one for my CFA exams and so I bought this Platinum Edition about 3 years ago.  Fresh out of the box I could see that this made in China version is a far cry from the made in Malaysia one that I was gifted with.  The overall construction was lacking and the buttons didn't have that nice feel to them.  Still, I was happy enough with it to use it for 2 levels of the CFA exams until recently when the poor construction took its toll.  The template surrounding the buttons started to peel off and the zero and Enter buttons refused to respond!  You have to press repeatedly and at a certain angle for them to register and hence takes away lots of time and accuracy as you have to check each time to ensure that you have actually entered the zero and/or the Enter key.  Obviously this was a big negative when I was doing my level 2 CFA exam.<br /><br />This HP 12C that I bought came with a nifty case but it's clear that they just don't make the 12C's as well as they used to.  From a 15-year life span of perfect service to about a 3-year one of troublesome and inconvenient use.  Right now, I don't think I can trust getting another made in China 12C and so if I decide to get another financial calculator, I'll probably have to go with the Texas Instruments offering.  Too bad though as I really liked my first 12C but with the state of the newer versions and how shoddy they have become as compared with what they used to be I have no choice unless massive improvements are made to the current manufacturing processes.<br /><br />If you are willing to try your luck with a product that is a pale shadow of what it used to be that will last at best for 3 years then this is for you.make the 12C's as well as they used to.

B003V4AK8E|3.0|I received this control a few days ago and I was pretty excited to see if this controller was what I was waiting for.  I like the dualshock controller but for FPS I have always liked the xbox controller, so when I heard this was coming out I wanted to try it out.      I will say that the control is sturdy and has potential but it still fell short of my expectations.  Everything is great except for the dead zone in the analogue sticks; this is what makes it hard for me to use the controller.  When moving the analogue sticks on the dualshock every movement is instant and smooth, but with this controller you move the sticks and it takes a second for the movement in the game to register.  I have seen some video reviews saying that there are no dead zones so maybe each controller is different or maybe some people just know how to adjust to it.  The analogue sticks on the pro elite are also pretty stiff so maybe that also takes some getting used to.      Overall the control is good if you can get used to the dead zone, but for me it looks like I'm using the dualshock.

B0013D8LOK|1.0|Nothing in this movie works well at all.<br /><br />Only two characters can sing, and they don't get as many songs as the main characters--which sound like angry geese drowning.  Most of the time the characters sing, and it's not action or character building, its one random song leading to another and giving very, very, very slow exposition.<br /><br />The lighting does work, creating no atmosphere at all. It's all too dark to see or it's too dull, eliminating what little emotional response the movie can acutally create.<br /><br />The characters show no emotion beyond the actors wondering what the did to deserve having to be in this movie and possibly constipation.  When the sailor  sings about love, one would expect him to be happy or anticipate something happy.  Instead, the character seems to hate himself and sounds drunk.  When Mrs. Lovett sings of her poor business, she sounds mildly happy to get the song over with.<br /><br />The blocking is always awkward, the plot is full of holes, and Marylin Manson has worn less black and white makeup at a concert.
B0036EH3X4|1.0|Don't buy this season; don't reward poor storytelling. The writers really dropped the ball here. It's not so much the lack of answers (although that is quite annoying) as it is the near total dissolution of the plot in seasons 1-5. How can a show take major plot arcs such as Ben and Widmore's War and push them into the background? As the season progressed, every character we once thought powerful in the realm of the mythology proved to be quite trivial and powerless - Ben, Widmore, and even Jacob. Please. This is bad writing, plain and simple. The dialogue was terrible, as was the inert pacing of most of the episodes. More happened in five episodes of season 5 than happened this entire season. Biggest disappointment in television history.<br /><br />\\"Well, we don't have a way to wrap up the show you've been watching the past 5 years, so here's something else.\\" That's season 6 in a nutshell. The producers tried pathetically to justify what they did this season by claiming the show was about the characters all along, a debate that has divided fans more than any other show I've ever heard of. Darlton, I will boycott every film and show you are involved in for the rest of my life, and will encourage others to do the same.
B0002S94OS|5.0|This album is, and should be a Metal Classic. It's perfect, period. When I first bought As The Palaces Burn and popped it into my cd player, I don't think it was removed for at least two weeks straight, I thought that album was one of the greatest things I had heard in a loooooooong time as far as metal goes. One thing about that record that you could consider a \\"Flaw\\" though, would be the fact that you can definitely tell it was produced by Devin Townsend. Not a bad thing per se, and I dig SYL, but any SYL fan should be able to tell that Heavy Devy definitely has a signature production formula he favors... but it did two things, pushed them forward and held them back... That may or may not make much sense... Until you hear Ashes Of The Wake... It explodes!!! It breathes!! It Breathes Fire!! And the band was right to not give Machine so much control of this record and stick to their guns because they knew what they were doing and what they wanted this record to sound like, unlike Sacrament that ended up WAYYYYY too polished I think due to giving Machine WAYYYY too much control... A killer album as well, but this was their masterpiece by far, on par with Rust in Peace and Master Of Puppets. If you don't own this yet, get it, it's mandatory Metal.
0439023513|2.0|*WARNING: SPOILERS*<br /><br />I found the entire story to be very sloppily written.<br /><br />In some ways, yes, I agree that this story is a war-story, and some of the scenes were rather poignant and helped invoked the theme that yes, war really really sucks. There's no doubt about it.<br /><br />However, I don't think this was great literature. Actually, comparing it to Twilight, with such scenes as the \\"let's talk about who the girl is going to pick while she's asleep\\" and the fact that whenever a major event occurs Katniss is conveniently in the hospital or unconscious and needs to be told about it later (whatever happened to show, not tell, Collins?), is not that far of a stretch. The characters that we fell in love with throughout the series, the reason the Hunger Games was wildly popular in the first place, were mysteriously missing the entire last book. Katniss was hollow and dead, Peeta was absent and even absent when he was there, Gale STILL had no personality, and Haymitch lost his sarcasm and spunk. I'm serious about Gale: whenever he talked or ranted about the Capital, it was like Katniss pulled a switch, refusing to let the reader understand this character at all. And Haymitch, while in the first books he seemed to have his hand in all the cookie jars, in the last book he was strangely uninvolved in the entire scheme to take over the Capital. All of them were \\"there\\" by name, but not by personality. What was the point of having them there if none of us could recognize them? Why not just write an entirely new book with new character names to apply to these misfits? It didn't fit at all. And, yes, there is nothing wrong with having characters who are affected by the horrors of war. I was actually impressed at the beginning by how Collins developed that sense of hopelessness. However, these were no longer the characters we fell in love with, nor did they share the relationship dynamics of the first two books.<br /><br />The pacing was also off completely. There was no real build-up, nothing was accomplished, and it just sort of sputtered off into nothingness at the end. I understand that this is supposedly \\"realistic\\", but at the same time it was just too dull and it dragged. Collins is a great action writer, there was no reason it should have had been that way. There are plenty of books that show the destitution and hopelessness of war without dragging, so you can't tell me that there are no other ways to present this other than what Collins gave us. Prim and Finnick died without a moment's thought or a chance to grieve, and we know this is not how Collins usually writes it, just based on how she presents Rue's death in the first book. And then to lead us on, for pages and pages filled with character deaths and confusing horrors (I can't be the only one who failed to understand the setup of the Capitals and the bizarre pods) only for Katniss to just pass out again with nothing accomplished. It was like, thanks Collins, for a completely pointless drag of action for no reason whatsoever. At least the first two books you gave us had action scenes that actually meant something to the overall plot structure.<br /><br />So, just overall, it was rather sloppy. Poorly paced, poorly written, characters forgotten or abandoned, and nothing we loved about the first two books even encompassed within the third book at all.
B000001ELF|5.0|\\"Ace Frehley\\" might be listed as a KISS album, but anyone who is a regular listener of the band knows that this particular album is all Ace.  Released simultaneously with \\"Paul Stanley,\\" \\"Peter Criss,\\" and \\"Gene Simmons\\" in September of 1978, Ace Frehley proved to be the most popular and best-selling of all four of the KISS solo projects.  Why?  Not because it was the most KISS sounding album of the lot (\\"Paul Stanley\\").  Not because it had the most experimental songs (\\"Gene Simmons\\").  Not even because it was entirely different than anything KISS has ever put out (\\"Peter Criss\\").<br /><br />No, this album was the best because it was Frehley at his best.  He wasn't fenced into the constraints of the KISS sound.  He didn't have to have a sleazy song on the album (which, I admittedly love about KISS), nor did he have to fit any slower songs like \\"Beth\\" or \\"Then She Kissed Me\\" on the album.  This was straight-ahead hard rock.  Even the cover of Hello's \\"New York Groove\\" had a bit of an edge to it.<br /><br />Frehley's guitar work is simply brilliant on this album.  \\"Rip It Out,\\" \\"Snowblind,\\" \\"Ozone,\\" \\"Wiped-Out,\\" and \\"Fractured Mirror\\" all showcase just how great Frehley really is on the strings.<br /><br />If you enjoy hard rock in the same vein as bands like Motley Crue, Ronnie James Dio-fronted Black Sabbath, or AC/DC, you're sure to enjoy \\"Ace Frehley.\\"  It's the best of the KISS solo albums, as well as one of the best KISS albums overall.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

B0036TGSRG|4.0|THE GHOST WRITER<br /><br />STARRING: Ewan McGregor, Pierce Brosnan, Olivia Williams,Tom Wilkinson, Kim Cattrall, Timothy Hutton and James Belushi<br /><br />WRITTEN BY: Roman Polanski and Robert Harris; based on the novel by Robert Harris<br /><br />DIRECTED BY: Roman Polanski<br /><br />Rated: R<br />Genre: Drama / Thriller<br />Release Date: 19 March 2010<br />Review Date: 02 September 2010<br /><br />I won't comment on my personal feelings of Roman Polanski, but I will credit him with being a talented filmmaker. He has an elegant gift of being able to take a thriller and jam pack it to the brim with as much drama as he can, without making it boring. I look at his films sometimes and wonder how he does it. Chinatown, The Pianist and The Ninth Gate, are among his best pictures, and are now followed by The Ghost Writer.<br /><br />Ewan McGregor stars as `The Ghost' - a writer who is good at what he does, but doesn't have much to be proud of in his life. McGregor is amazing. The guy has the ability to take a character that we would normally look at like a joke or a dork, and make us not only like him, but love him by the end of the movie. The Men Who Stare at Goats displays this beautifully.<br /><br />His Ghost character here, is the same. There is nothing big and cinematic about him that would ordinarily warrant him to be a lead character. In fact, had McGregor not been cast to play him, I'm not sure the film would have worked.<br /><br />We follow The Ghost from start to finish. He's invited to a meeting at which he is offered a very large sum of money to act as a ghost writer for a well known politician named Lang (Pierce Brosnan).  Lang has been working on his autobiography with another ghost writer, who has just turned up dead; dun, Dun, DUN!<br /><br />Something shady is going on with Lang and soon The Ghost grows suspicious of this and decides to do some snooping around. Was this guy involved in the mysterious death of his previous ghost? And will our ghost be next?<br /><br />As was the case in Salt and a ton of other movies, there are undoubtedly themes and tones in The Ghost Writer that can shadow current day political scandals; but that doesn't interest me. Who cares? We go to the movies to be entertained with fiction, not political nonsense. So, sorry - we won't be discussing that today; but the news is on at six.<br /><br />The story is very riveting and grasps your attention right away and this is where Polanski shines the most: telling the story with the camera. As best I can remember, we never knew anything that The Ghost didn't. That's good suspense.<br /><br />Lots of clues, lots of twists, love affairs, lying, brilliant writing and directing, great acting by everyone all around and a brilliant story, all wrapped up with one of the best endings I've seen in a while.

B003QNXPUK|2.0|I think anyone who's used both the ZAGG invisibleSHIELD and Power Support's Crystal Film [[ASIN:B003VM4YLA Powersupport Combo Film Set for iPhone 4G 60-102123101]] is going to prefer the latter to a wide degree -- it's just no competition.    I've had the PS Crystal Film on every iPhone since the first one and they're great.  They improve the feel of using the touch screen (they make it a bit slipperier than the glass) and they don't interfere with the look (the anti-glare ones may -- I just use the regular film).  They are not as a general matter \\"easy\\" to apply, but compared to ZAGG they're a cinch.  And moreover, once they're on the phone, they are invisible and NEVER move.    The only reason I went with ZAGG this time is because PS didn't have films ready on iPhone launch day -- no idea why, but pretty strange.  ZAGG did and I give them credit for that. BUT --     1) Installation    The ZAGG installation procedure is comically complex.  It has a squirt bottle of water and a squeegee, people.  Remember paying hundreds of dollars for this phone? And now you want me to SPRAY IT?    OK, fine, I'll spray it.  I'll spray it and I'll squeegee it.  I will be frightened but I will do it.  But oh god, now that I've done it, you say I need to LEAVE THE PHONE ALONE FOR 24 HOURS? Are you *kidding*??? I just bought this! I want to play with it!    OK fine... I'll leave it for 24 hours... because you said if I didn't, the screen will peel off.  So I left my beautiful new phone, on launch day, alone for 24 hours.  I had to beg the AT&T guy not to shut off my old phone so that I could literally wait for ZAGG to dry.  I waited 24 hours and put it in my pocket and... the front top right corner immediately peeled back. Oh hell no. I did the spray. I did the squeegee.  I did the wait 24 hours. AND FAIL.    PS Crystal Film installation, by contrast? Similarly annoying to ZAGG in that they both want a dust free room (um, where?) but you literally just take the film out of the box, usethe included sticky sheet to pull off the dust, carefully place on the PS film, and it's done. Immediately. No spray. No squeegee. No 24 hours. And it will never come off accidentally.    2) Look    As many others have posted, this is some kind of crazy rubbery plasticky business.  It does not look good.  I don't care what the other posters said about leaving it for 24 hours, or 48 hours, or a million hours.  It still is a weird rubbery thing and even if you have managed to get all the air out, and even if you let it dry, there is a weird rippling/rainbow effect as you tilt the phone around.  You will always notice it, and it will annoy you.  It is because it is rubbery and can stretch or change thickness.    Moreover, when that corner comes up, it never really goes back down.  I had people look at the phone and go \\"Um, what is up with that corner?\\" because it looks terrible.  My sole goal at that point was keeping the film pressed down repeatedly to avoid scratching the glass until the PS film came.    Not to mention, self-healing? Survey says no. I ran my fingernails down the front of the screen as a test and it left scratches.  They never \\"healed.\\" They were always scratches, and they were always visible.  Just using my fingernails.      PS film, by contrast: looks fabulous. Never peels up.  No rainbow or warping effect because it is plastic and does not shift or bend.  But -- it will also show scratches if you go at it.    3) Feel    The feel in your hand of the back of the phone and the sides of the phone when equipped with ZAGG is pretty pleasant, and that's why I give it two stars.  The rubber does make it more grippable and you feel more secure holding it. HOWEVER...    The feel on the front of the screen is awful. Any time you're playing a game that requires quick swipes or any kind of detailed movement -- you will fail.  It makes the resistance significantly more so.  It is unpleasant.    And that nice rubbery texture when you're holding the phone? If youput it down on any surface - glass, polished wood, leather car seats -- it STICKS.  It sticks to the point where it makes a sound when you lift it up.  It sticks to the point where sometimes the film gets lifted up by whatever you put the phone on.  I've had it happen with laminated ID cards in my wallet, with car seats, with my glass coffee table, etc.  Not good.    PS, by contrast? Feels amazing.  It feels better than the glass.  It is so easy to work with the touch screen that it makes the iPhone better.  It does not, however, help you grip -- and even the dual film package won't protect the sides.    Conclusion -- do not buy the ZAGG.  The only part of the ZAGG I've left on is the back and the sides.  The back hasn't peeled up yet in a way that makes it terrible, but I assume it will happen inevitably. Until then, I'll leave it to protect the back and I'll just be annoyed that it sticks to everything.  The sides have been fine and I assume will protect the corners a bit.  But the front -- oh, the front ZAGG came off the second PS came in the house and I've not looked back. Go Power Support.
B003PGNBO8|4.0|there are better tv shows, but you would have to go to cable to find them.  This series I thought was very good for network tv.  The characters were likable, good acting.<br /><br />The premise:  the world \\"blacks out\\" for 2 minutes and 17 seconds.  There is no recall during that time period.  Call it a collective unconscious moment.  Naturally, many disasters happen (plane crashes, car crashes, chaos).<br /><br />One L.A. cop has the ability to flash forward and get glimpses of what was going on during the lost 2 minutes of time.  He is trying to piece together the cause- was it a massive electro magnetic pulse, or a terrorist plot?  Or something else?
B00095NX9G|5.0|I've been practicing belly dance for a couple of years, and I still found this dvd useful. The first dvd starts with about a half hour yoga routine - mostly good for strengthening and opening the parts of the body you use most in belly dance. It's a little boring, but if you're at all serious about dancing, it's probably a good thing to do. What I like about the first dvd is the drills are actually useful. She has leg strengthening drills, shoulders, upper abs and lower abs, then shimmy drills. It's not the most fun ever, but again - useful if you're serious about dancing. It's particularly good practice for traveling while doing upper body movements and for level changes while dancing. She also includes some practice with different types of body rolls that could help with anyone who struggles with belly rolls, or differentiating different types of camel. It's hard to get that kind of practice in a classroom or workshop setting. It ends with a cool-down yoga practice.<br /><br />The second dvd teachers two routines that cover all the material you've drilled. It also includes a yoga section to prepare your back for back-bending. There is a lot of yoga and a lot of drills in this set, but it's all stuff you should be able to do if you want to dance well and for a long time.<br /><br />Warning - this dvd is LONG. Don't expect to do it all in one sitting, especially not every day. The nice thing is she gives you a recommended schedule for when to practice each section.
B000OCY7JE|5.0|This is simply a great film -- hands down.  Felt very real -- almost like a documentary.  Took me a long time to warm up to the main character, but I got to like him by the end.  I guess that was the point of the film --just because someone is doing charity work in a foreign land does not mean he is without faults.  Also, sometimes your good works are needed more by those who are \\"rich\\" than those in third world countries.
1400052173|3.0|I suppose for most readers the HeLa cell and its long anonymous donor, Henrietta Lacks, is something new and unsettling, but Rebecca Skloot has done little more than draw on previous sources, including a 1997 BBC documentary, to present a case against all those who exploited the HeLa cell for their own gain, taking on cancer cell researchers and cell banks alike in this awkward book.<br /><br />If Skloot had stuck to telling the story of Henrietta Lacks and her children it would have made for a better book, but she couldn't resist making her book into a treatise of sorts on cell study, and how human cells come to be exploited without our knowledge.  It doesn't matter that the identity of the HeLa cell has long been public knowledge, dating back to Michael Rogers' 1976 article for the Rolling Stone magazine.  Then there was Michael Gold's 1986 book, [[ASIN:0887060994 A Conspiracy of Cells]].  Hannah Landecker wrote an award winning essay in 1996 asking many of the same ethical questions that Skloot poses in this book.  In 1997, Adam Curtis did an hour-length documentary for BBC, which included interviews with the Lacks family, including Deborah.  The film is available for viewing through his blog site at BBC, and Landecker's essay can be found with a simple search on Google.<br /><br />Skloot does credit her sources, but she doesn't seem to really shed any new light on them, other than to mention the extra tapes she was able to view of Curtis' documentary.  Basically, you get a run down of events from George Gey's pioneering research of HeLa cells to the continued use of these cells in searching out new cures for cancer.  Throughout, Skloot continually reminds how the Lacks family failed to benefit in any way from all this groundbreaking research and wasn't even aware of much of it until they found themselves being interviewed by Rolling Stone magazine.  It was then they learned that vials of HeLa cells were being sold for $25 each, infuriating Deborah's brothers who felt they should get their share.<br /><br />There is kind of a Dickensian approach to this story, as we learn the sad state affairs that has befallen the Lacks family.  Chalk this up to \\"creative non-fiction,\\" which Skloot seems to specialize in at Memphis University.  You really don't come to the heart of the book until the end, when she finally tells of her encounters with Deborah Lacks, as the two embark on their search for Henrietta's records and those of a sister Deborah never knew.  Sadly, it took another ten years before Skloot published the book, as Deborah had died in the years in between.  Kind of makes you wonder what took so long for Skloot to get this book into print, as it seems much of the research was done in 1999.<br /><br />The book has since become a runaway bestseller, giving Skloot far more notoriety than any of the persons she takes to task in these pages.  To her credit, she is giving part of the proceeds to the Henrietta Lacks Foundation she helped to resuscitate.  And, the surviving Lacks family is getting more attention than they ever received before.  But, it would seem that Rebecca Skloot has gained the most from the \\"immortal life\\" of Henrietta Lacks.uld get their share.

B000RZIGVS|1.0|It is insulting what PARAMOUNT has done in regards to the cases the discs come in.  They put the 5 dollar dvd's at gas stations in better quality cases then these (LITERALLY 100%)  I feel so ripped off because half my Next Generation episodes cannot be watched due to poor quality casing.  The discs came with scratches and fall out every time you try to flip through them.  Some were all ready out of place when opened for the first time!; Im just amazed at how terrible Paramount is with quality......

B0029LHW4U|4.0|I'll be the first to admit that I LOL'd at the thought of \\"Alice in Chains\\" releasing an album without their front man.  The sick thing is, after listening, you'd hardly even realize he's not there! Cantrell and new front man William DuVall harmonize just like Layne and Jerry used to do, and you can hardly tell the difference, to be honest.<br /><br />Cantrell carries most of the lyrics on this album, but it still has a VERY Alice in Chains feel to it, especially with all of the harmonizing that they do.<br /><br />This isn't vintage \\"Dirt\\" or \\"Jar of Flies\\" AIC, but it's still very good.  I'd actually even rank this album higher than the Self-Titled \\"3 Legged Dog\\" album, where Layne was virtually useless due to his failing health.<br /><br />All in all, I strongly recommend this album to any non-believer such as I was!

0307473708|5.0|Dexter Morgan is a serial killer.  It's something he can't control.  But being rasied by a foster dad who was a cop who taught him to only kill the \\"bad\\" guys, Dexter does just that.  The book opens with Dexter going after a priest who has killed orphaned children.  Dexter's dad also taught him how to leave no evidence behind at the crime scene; therefore, Dexter is very thorough in his killings.  The only bad thing about Dexter's killings is how much he enjoys doing it - he has an inner voice he hears which pushes him forward and he and the inner voice take much delight in the dissecting of another human being.<br /><br />Dexter's parents are now dead but he has a foster sister, Deborah, who happens to be a cop.  There is a vicious serial killer on the loose in Miami and Deborah asks Dexter for his help in catching him.  Deborah knows nothing about Dexter's inner demons, only their dad knew.  Deborah just knows that Dexter has a knack for solving serial killings.  Deborah is trying hard to get out of vice and be promoted to homicide but she has no political moves whatsoever.  Dexter tries to help her with being political but Deborah usually just ends up messing it up.<br /><br />The problem with catching with this latest serial killer is that he using Dexter's methods of chopping the body up and leaving no blood behind.  Then Dexter starts dreaming about the serial killer and how he is dispatching his victims which puts him hot on the serial killer's trial.  His work is so much like Dexter's that Dexter gets intense joy just from seeing the artistry of the other's work.  Now Dexter is torn being helping Deborah catch the serial killer or finding him and becoming partners with him, but Dexter decides to do the right thing and help Deborah.<br /><br />Jeff Lindsay came up with a great approach to this genre and should be lauded for that.  Dexter's dry wit will keep one turning the pages as he analyzes not just death, but everyday life, relationships, political manuevering in the police department, and complex human emotions.  It was an enjoyable read and I look forward to book #2.partment, and complex human emotions.  It was an enjoyable read and I look forward to book #2.

0553386816|5.0|When I finally got around to reading \\"Ford County: Stories\\" by John Grisham, I didn't have any high hopes.  I knew John had gone straight from attorney in DeSoto County, MS., to novelist, although the route took him several years.  Note: as former president of the Mississippi Writer's Club, I remember talking to John after he had bedazzled our membership at a conference; he told me and the president-elect he had high hopes for a book he had just finished called The Firm.  I had heard that John carried many of the printed hard covers of \\"A Time to Kill\\", his first novel, around in his trunk, and I came ever so close to telling him that day:  \\"Don't get your hopes up, John.  Your first book has been slow in making it.\\"  Now I didn't say that to John, and I would have been wrong on two counts: First, John was correct to be high on The Firm's future, because just a few weeks after that Paramount Studios offfered \\"big bucks\\" to purchase the film rights to \\"The Firm,\\" and John's well-deserved bestsellerhood was established.  Second, A Time To Kill may be John's finest writing, and made an excellent movie.    I say all this to stress that \\"Ford County: Stories\\" is simply excellent.  Pat Conroy's superb review is correct on that.  What makes his stories so good is that he balances justice and mercy beautifully.  I was expecting a kind of softness gleaned from his Baptist faith; what I and other readers got is a writer who knows all too expertly the highs and lows of the human psyche.  No happy endings here, unless they're warranted.  Good job, John!  Lanny McKay

B002QGSYRC|4.0|This pivotal event in U.S. history has been buried between the histories and controversies of WWII and Vietnam. It's sad that we pay little attention to a conflict that in only three years was nearly as costly as Vietnam. Politics are always part of wars, but Korea more than most. It set the stage for most conflicts to come. The lessons of Korea were soon forgotten and the groundwork laid for Vietnam. Halberstam details the people, the sides and the causes of Korea. He focuses mainly on the early months and more or less summarizes the rest. No single volume is a complete history, but this will show you the causes and effects of this conflict. Does Halberstam come across one-sided in the politics of the war? Sometimes, but he does hit Kennedy hard for falling into the trap of Vietnam. The lessons of Korea should have kept us out of Vietnam, but when we forget history, we repeat its mistakes and stupidities.

I thought the story did have a plot and although there was no huge climax of the book or anything like that, I thoroughly enjoyed it and finished the book in just a couple of nights.

Especially after reading the reviews on here since apparently those are so much better :P    All in all i really enjoyed this book. I thought it was fun and witty. The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the ending. I thought it didn't finish well... I think a chapter was ripped out of my book or something : 
0439023483|3.0|The Hunger Games (2008) is the first in the super-popular young adult series by Suzanne Collins. Highly critically acclaimed, with a movie deal in the works, the trilogy has successfully sold millions of copies. (Scholastic must be very, very pleased.)    In the future, North America is divided into 13 districts (one a ruined wasteland), all controlled with an iron fist by the Capitol. The districts are still paying the price for a failed rebellion generations before - the government is doing its damndest to grind them into the ground.    Into this bleak future comes young Katniss, age 16. Katniss has taken care of her family ever since her father died - mostly through illegal hunting. This, in the long run, proves fortunate: hunting has given her the skill set she needs to fight off 23 other semi-feral teens in the annual \\"Hunger Games\\".    Not satisfied with just crushing the districts physically, the Capitol demands human sacrifice as well - 2 teens from each district are brought in every year and forced to fight to the death. It's not just brutal reprisal, it's entertainment!    The majority of the book takes place inside the game itself. Katniss can't get just away with surviving - she also needs to make a series of increasingly difficult moral decisions regarding her fellow combatants. Some are one-dimensional and utterly loathsome (fire away!), others have more complex motivation (and even names!), making it harder for Katniss to rationalize their murder.    Katniss is a strong character (if slightly dense when it comes to personal interaction). The action is good - I'm not sure there's ever any doubt about who is going to win, but Collins still keeps things tense. When it comes down to it, I'd be much more impressed if it all hadn't been done before.    Battle Royale, the 1999 novel (first in English in 2003) by Koushon Takami is about a futuristic, dystopian government that randomly kidnaps children and forces them to fight to the death for the entertainment of the masses. Initially a book, it was adapted into a manga series and a popular cult film.    Takami's book has the same moral ambiguity, the same teen romantic struggles and the same horrific violence. It also has the same dystopian, omnipotent government, maneuvering behind the scenes. (Including the same ending - in which the conflict escalates from the physical arena to a political one.) But where Takami's book veers towards the artistic - a sparse writing style that uses violence to emphasize the surreal horror of the situation - Collins' The Hunger Games is more story-driven.    Ms Collins cites a variety of influences for The Hunger Games - including Greek mythology - but not Takashi's book. I'm certainly not accusing her of plagiarism. It is merely a question of stylistic difference - two authors telling a very similar story in a very different way.     I prefer Takashi's 1999 work, but I can understand why a young adult publisher (and, trusting their expertise, a young adult audience as well) would be more drawn to the safer option of Collins' version. The Hunger Games is a fairly respectable book, but the unmitigated enthusiasm surrounding it leaves a bad taste in my mouth. Battle Royale, unsurprisingly, is now back in print - I recommend that other readers take the chance to make their own comparisons.
0142410373|3.0|I confess -- I love the book \\"Matilda.\\"<br /><br />A total fantasy novel lies behind the mask of a British school tale.<br /><br />Roald Dahl crossed the line into the utterly unbelievable by making his villains so incredibly bad.  It's preposterous, and funny.  So while this is a book that prominently features bullying, intimidation, horrible insults, and violent mistreatment of children, it isn't scary at all -- instead, it is funny.<br /><br />It's the vocabulary words and the quality of the writing that get me. Superb.<br /><br />As a read-aloud mom, who can read it and share the laughs with my family, I love this book.  Still, I have to caution parents to pre-read it before you give it to your children.  There is over-the-top anger, name-calling, and violence directed at kids -- and the kids take revenge in dangerous and harmful ways.  We treat this the same way we treat Tom and Jerry or Sylvester and Tweety bird -- total fantasy.  Don't behave like that.  Isn't it funny?<br /><br />Parents are the best judges.

I knew I was going to love the box set even it it literally came in a a cardboard box.  Luckily, it did not. The packaging on this set is so fantastic, and the attention to detail is very much in tune with the show. Spoiler alert, there's a hidden disc. The bonus features are aplenty. I have been spacing out the 30 extra hours to make it last a little bit longer, but they are definitely great. The Easter eggs are also truly fun. If there are any Michael Giacchino fans reading this, be on the lookout for a Giacchino-y egg, of sorts. The epilogue is exactly what an epilogue is supposed to be. It has the same feel of the show while gently touching upon areas from the series. I was definitely worried that it would try to spell things out or touch upon themes that were ended so beautifully, but they did a fantastic job!<br /><br />The Oceanic logo that appears as the Blu-Ray discs are loading is also very fun.
B002ZG98UA|4.0|What is there to say, in this, the fourth go around for the better-as-a-game-than-a-movie adaptation?  Partially due to my fondness for the now venerable game series and probably also partially due to the fact that Milla Jovovich is, once again, kicking ass and taking names, I tend to have a soft spot in my heart for the Resident Evil series.  Even though none of the sequels ever lived up to the original (which, in and of itself, isn't a terrific movie), I was excited for Afterlife, the fourth movie but also the first since the original to be directed by Paul W.S. Anderson (Event Horizon and a bunch of other lesser films).  I guess, for me, Resident Evil falls into a guilty pleasure corner, wired off and surrounded by other equally bad guilty pleasures (the likes of which I'd tell you about, but then I'd have to kill you).  At any rate, here we are.  Fourth movie in a series that's been chugging along and losing steam.  And I have to say that this is easily the best of the sequels.    Watching the trailers, you never really get a feel for what the story would be, fourth time around.  Instead we're provided with plenty of action shots of items flying at the screen, pronouncements of \\"3D!!!\\" and \\"filmed with the same cameras as Avatar!!\\", which, after seeing the movie, is probably because there's not much else to the film.  It opens in Tokyo, at some uncertain time in the future, years after the events of the first film.  The Umbrella Corporation is still churning out bio-experiments which makes me wonder, \\"why?\\".  If the world is as empty and personless as it seems to be, who are they making them for?  Seeing as how society has collapsed globally, is Umbrella making bioweapons/experimenting on people just to...*finger upturned to lip* be evil?  Isn't that kind of counter-productive?  It's not as if they have control over their creations (the action opens with Umbrella goons shooting at zombies for sport), so why would they keep churning out monsters?  But before youcan dwell longer on this question, we have Alice times a hundred mowing down faceless Umbrella goons, blowing up lobbies, diving through glass, turned upwards and shooting in slow motion and basically ripping off every action sequence from The Matrix (which was...what, almost eleven years ago?), except this time it's in 3D.  Oh and there's two Alices diving through glass and falling, whilst shooting, a la Matrix Reloaded; two Millas > one Carrie-Anne Moss.    After blowing the hell out of the Umbrella Tokyo lab and losing her ridiculous psychic/clone powers, Alice is turned back to human (which is probably the only plot point in this film, and a much welcomed one at that), Wesker has vanished and she can return to locating her friends who she last saw flying away to Alaska in a helicopter.  Oh and we have another lapse of time, this time for 6 months.  What has she been doing this whole time?!      Moving on...    Once the film proper begins, we end up in LA and it becomes a similar structure to the first film; protagonists are trapped in a building (this time a more boring prison) and must get out/survive against hordes of undead.  Expendable characters are introduced, only to be dispatched, mostly off-camera.  Oh and to, I guess, further emphasize that this is, yes, based on the game series even though it does not resemble it at all by now, Anderson throws in Chris Redfield.  By this time, we're hurtling toward the ending, which seems to take longer to reach than the running time allows, and are given another cliffhanger-y ended to set up another entry and boom: run credits...oh wait, no.  We have a mid-credits scene, too, so don't take your glasses off.    Which brings me back to the trailers: 3D! James Cameron cameras!  Yes, those are the big bullet points and yes it's the reason to see the film (unless you're like me and secretly harbor a Resident Evil guilty pleasure center).  Say what you will about Paul W.S. Anderson and his directing skills, but the man does know how to stage a shot.  His cinematographer captures some awesome-looking shots.  And the effects are pretty snazzy, even though Anderson hasn't met a Matrix shot/gimmick he doesn't like.  Nothing in this film is even remotely original or as exciting as the films/segments they're based on, but the 3D is probably the best I've seen in a film.  And yes, that includes Avatar.  Every single film that has come out between Avatar and Afterlife has been post-converted to 3D after the filming and it shows.  The scenes pop with life and space in Afterlife and while Anderson uses bullet-time and freeze shots a bit too much, each one looks phenonimal in 3D.  It's pretty fantastically filmed.  He also brings a splashy style to a series that hasn't been filmed very well since the original.  Who knew that the thing Resident Evil was missing was Anderson?      So is Afterlife a good movie?  Oh no.  Not at all.  Why the four stars?  Because I enjoyed myself through pretty much the entire movie and was entertained.  Sure, it kind of drags on a bit and Anderson uses fade to black and fade to white so much that it feels like the movie never truly starts. But I enjoyed it, for what it was, and this is the first time since Avatar where I didn't feel like my $12.50 was wasted on the 3D.  Fans of the series, you should enjoy this entry.  Everyone else?  Well...the 3D's exceptional.
B000002H97|4.0|metallica is an awsome band the tracks are great the album is great.  the problem i encountered was that the cd since its used on \\"Sad But True\\" it starts skiping.If you can get new items but if your gating 5 dollar gift cards from search and win websites like swagbucks [...] you should expect ok quality not excellent quality.Dont get me wrong the cd is awesome but since its used it ruins the expirience a bit.

B003KUSUSQ|4.0|This is definitely a good CD. Like any album I guess, not EVERY SINGLE song is awesome, but still good. Getting the clean version was a good choice. Love Eminem's sound and mixes, never crazy about back to back profanity. Not into it. So this was a good pick for sure.<br />Don't have to offend passengers in my car, my OWN ears, passersby in traffic, etc. LOL. and you don't MISS the actual words at all. Good editing lets you hear every beat just the same. One if his better albums overall from him, and got it for a fab price .  Love it.
1416562605|4.0|I like Adiga's very lucid style of writing. He takes us through dark alleys and corners of life all with a charming fashion.    The novel tells us the stories of life in Indian cities lived outside outside the posh malls, A/C cars and apartments. Also of political and police attrocities in Indian cities and villages - all through the eyes of protagonist Balram Halwai.    The story is very dark and in places facts have been bent and cliched to darken it even more.

0470601787|2.0|I felt compelled to write a review of this book as I did not find the professional reviews spoke to the content of this book. I was excited to pre-order this book as the topic is pertinent to my current position, I was expecting to add some new tools to my belt to help me facilitate team meetings that are both productive and worthwhile. I was disappointed to find that the book read like the author's portfolio. The chapters and headers outlined the content but the text is full of stories describing how the author handled a meeting with a client. I do not think I read one paragraph in the book that did not use the first person. If you are looking for a book to review how 'someone else did it' - this book fits the bill.  If you are looking for strategy, tips and 'how to' - it is not written in a way that is easy to incorporate the authors experiences into your arsenal.<br />One other annoyance is the size and shape of the book make it difficult to hold upright to read once opened, it is too wide; its too thick to wrap the pages behind the book once you are past the first few chapters. Setting it on your lap will not work either, cannot see the outer margins where the supporting graphic are placed. Very annoying.

B00009NQQO|2.0|My 18-24 month old got fairly annoyed with this bath toy.  The hoop is just a net, so the balls don't come out of the bottom.  You have to reach back into the hoop to get the balls out.  When my son or I did this, the hoop came off the bathtub wall.  I specifically had a problem with the left suction cup not staying attached.  The right suction cup worked fine, so the hoop was always falling sideways.  Also, the balls have small holes in them and take in water.  I had a serious issue with mold collecting in the balls...and at bathtime, if you squeezed the balls, a ton of mold flakes come out.  Unless I cleaned them out before bath time, I really didn't want them in the tub.  I'd suggest going with another brand.

0307454541|3.0|I read this book in part because of all of the overheated hype and hoopla surrounding it. I must admit I found it a bit disappointing. It's not a bad story exactly, but the structure, pacing, and character development left much to be desired. There are many long, tedious descriptive passages dealing with the financial dealings of Swedish corporations and the complete geneology of one family. Some of this is essential to the plot, but the rest seems like padding and seriously affects the pacing of the story. In its paperback form, this book is nearly 600 pages long. I felt the story could have easily been told in 300. There is also a problem with character development. The main character, Mikael Blomkvist, is described as a \\"charismatic womanizer,\\" but the way he is written, he seems lumpy, unlikeable, and completely devoid of charisma. The titular character is interesting, but as another reviewer pointed out, she is little more than a sidekick in the book. Needless to say, I will not be reading the sequels.
B003SWNRTI|5.0|NOTE: The following review is written under the assumption one would be willing to hear `Accept' with another singer than Udo; and at not point does it question whether the change is a good or bad thing (as this is probably a very personal question that each fan should answer for oneself).<br /><br />`Blood of Nations' marks the return of `Accept' as a recording artist and a highly appraised release by the press already. Leading members Wolf Hoffmann (g) and Peter Baltes (d) reunite with Herman Frank (g) (who played guitar on the classic `Balls to the wall') and Stefan Schwarzzmann (d); The new front man is American singer Mark Tornillo (ex-\\"TT Quick\\").<br /><br />What needs to be clear is that `Blood of the nations' effectively goes back to the classic 'Accept' sound of the first four albums only with more melodies, grandiose arrangements and obviously state of the art production. Equally very important is the fact that Tornillo's approach is in the classic growl-high pitched vocals that defined the sound of `Accept' during the late 70s early 80s.<br /><br />So in the beginning one might as well have the impression of listening to the original `Accept' line up; still this new effort does not have that spontaneous feel of the classic albums yet it more than makes up for through perfect planning! It is evident that the compositions have been developed to perfection and the amount of effort put by the band both in terms of songwriting and performance very much does justice to the legendary `Accept' name. We are not simply looking at huge hooks building up to metallic choruses, but the solos along with the instrumental passages are just so well arranged. At parts the mixture of drums, twin guitar and huge bass line come out so heavy and melodic at the same time, it's brilliant! `Beat the bastards', `Teutonic Terror', `Blood of the nations', `Shades of death', `Pandemic' and `No shelter' all flawless heavy/power material.<br /><br />The majority of the presses have been keen on appraising Mark Tornillo above all for his unexpectedly stellar performance. Dare I say, however, that in the back of my mind, I suspected this album would turn out as well as it did. You see, the leading members of `Accept' might have been out of the metal genre for quite some time yet guitarist Herman Frank and drummer Stefan Schwarzzmann have been consistently working on material while the latest collaboration of the two musicians, the `Herman Frank -Loyal to none' album of 2009 was an absolute dynamite of a release that received top rating for being the fastest, heaviest and most aggressive of their previous works.<br /><br />So Mark Tronillo might be the new star of Accept, yet Herman and Stefan are the band's secret aces and `Blood of nations' is a perfect example where the powers come to one. And metal history has shown that you can't beat a focused collective effort, and that's exactly what `Blood of nations' is.If you decide to buy the album, music-wise you will be 120% rewarded.<br /><br />\\"Metal Hammer\\" Greek magazine (issue 309) marks this album with 9/10 commenting: \\"Heavy metal full of soul, identity and experience...\\"<br /><br />\\"RockHard\\" Greek magazine (issue 54) marks this album with 8/10 commenting: \\"Should appeal to all long term fans of the band\\"ornillo above all for his unexpectedly stellar performance.

0399536108|3.0|I enjoyed reading The Art of Non-Conformity in its book form and found the message inspirational. Chris's tone and presentation are honest and unpretentious, unlike other bloggers who write about similar topics.  Although Chris's path is unconventional, the process he follows is not and he shares his advice with that in mind. I found the book a good starting point to reflect on the possibility of a life path change.  For a holistic approach on self-awareness, personal strategy setting, and sound marketing tactical advice I strongly recommend Zen and The Art of Making a Living, by Laurence G. Boldt.

B0030ZOYHC|5.0|I'm a long-time fan of Evangelion; I own both the original DVD run and the Platinum DVDs, and it's one of my favorite anime series of all time.  When the new movies began production, I was completely psyched, and let me tell you,they do not disappoint.  This first movie is a fairly faithful re-telling of the first 7 episodes of the series (everything before Asuka shows up).   There are a few changes in the events, the characters have all undergone subtle personality changes (Shinji isn't as whiny!  Rei isn't as dull!), and a lot of things have undergone design changes.  There is a lot of animation recycled from the series, but it's been gone over and improved, and now looks smooth and gorgeous, especially on blu-ray. They use a lot of CG now, which I am still on the fence about.. I'm a little bit of a 2D purist, but having done some animation, I understand the efficiency of the CG.  Other than polishing it up tremendously, this movie doesn't add much to the experience of the series, but it does set up for the second movie, which is a *huge* departure from the series... I can't wait for *that* on blu-ray!    As for the blu-ray itself, the picture is phenomenal, of course, as well as the sound.  I don't crank up the sound on many of my movies, but in this case I was blasting it. I was also impressed with the special features included. From what I've researched, they included all of the special features that were included in the Japanese DVD release.  The disc also comes with a small program booklet with character and setting information, like the kind they give out at Japanese movie premieres.  I thought that was very cool, because the only other way to get those programs is to try and nab one on an auction site, and then they're expensive and un-translated. The translation of the movie itself is also very good, although I can't speak for the dub as I've only viewed it in Japanese with English subtitles.  Funimation isn't always known for its stellar translations (they actually list their translations as \\"reversioning\\" in the majority of their releases), but this one is, thankfully, up-to-par with the ADV and Manga Evangelion releases.      These new Evangelion movies were meant to be a way to introduce the series to a new generation of viewers, and they can stand very well on their own, especially with this first movie as a foundation.  But they are also extremely enjoyable for us die-hard fans of the series, adding a new dimension and yet another interpretation of the events leading up to the Third Impact.

B000089Q9D|5.0|I saw this movie when it first hit the screen in the USA...and couldn't wait until it came out on DVD.  It is one of my favorite movies of all time, and there's much to love about it.  The irrepressible Toto is a little pest, but he befriends the older Alfredo, projectionist at the lone cinema in their Sicilian village, shattered by war and poverty.  Toto observes Alfredo and learns the workings of the projector, loaded with flammable film stock.  A terrible accident leaves Toto in charge, and the movie fast forwards into Toto's teen  years. He falls in love with the beautiful Elena, who is seemingly unattainable.  Her family is wealthy, and Toto's is not.  The young lovers part, never to meet again.  Some other reviewers have missed the point of this movie.  It is about unrequited love, and the bittersweet memories that Toto relives when learning of Alfredo's death, as the film opens.  The final scene, wherein Alfredo's gift to Toto makes the point that love is the thing that makes life worth living... is incredibly powerful.  Without a word, in about 2.5 minutes, the director creates a scene that is already a film classic.   PLOT SPOILER AHEAD  Regarding the so-called \\"director's cut\\" that was issued some years after the cinema release. I saw it. It's on the flip side of my DVD.  I hated it so much that I almost gouged that side of the DVD to keep it from ever being played again.  Better to have the film end as it did originally.  To have Toto/Salvatore and Elena reunite later in life is one thing...but to have them getting it on in the back seat of a car  was totally unbelievable and incongruous. A successful and wealthy director would take the love of his life to the nicest hotel in Rome for a rendezvous, he would hardly consummate their relationship like two frumpy middle-aged former lovers would. Heck, most middle aged people would get a room. This scene rang falsely and ruined this version of the film.  STICK WITH THE ORIGINAL THEATRICAL RELEASE!  GET IT, OWNIT AND LOVE IT...  FORGET THE DIRECTOR'S CUT!
0439023513|2.0|**spoiler alert** I have to admit that I was left feeling depressed after reading this book. I was utterly taken aback with the many flaws in the writing and the utter lack of growth by the main character. I found myself wanting to run off in tears, find a closet to hide in, berry myself in satin clothes and drift off into oblivion.    Mockingjay mocks the first and even the second book before it. Katniss who enters our lives as a lion, ends up leaving like a lamb. She is so caught up in self-pity that I couldn't help wanting to slap her all the way through the book. There are a few times that I am impressed and a hope rises up that the book will turn for the better; I'm utterly crushed again when it doesn't.    Through the first two books we are introduced to and then captivated by a strong willed young woman who was forced to grow up too fast. Instead of wallowing in self-pity, she stands tall and exceeds what is expected of her. She survives whatever the cost. We arrive at the third book and instead of that character who stood tall, we get a character who took the opposite path from the very beginning. We get a loser who can't stand up at all and who does nothing but cry and snivel. Katniss grows to just be cut down in a few fell pages, as if nothing over the last two books ever happened.    Suzanne Collins dropped the ball. This whole book is rushed and the story jumps so fast that more than half of the action is told in retrospect in one or two sentences. I also noticed that it is the same book as the first two, just terribly written. Characters are given time on the pages and then seem to fall off, just to arise again with little or no context. Other characters are given time, but not enough before they are violently killed. Again this action takes place after the fact in one to two short sentences.    Peeta gives Katniss a Pearl in the second book. After Peeta is captured and brain washed, I couldn't help but think that the pearl would play and instrumental role in bringing him back from his brain washed madness. Katniss carries the Pearl with her through the whole book and uses it as a way to remember Peeta as he once was. The Pearl becomes important however, it's dropped and is never brought up again about 2/3rds through the book.    Katniss continues to be undecided as to who she loves and plays her games with both Gale and Peeta. However I couldn't help but feel that Gale made up his mind and in the end, it was his decision that put Peeta with Katniss. Katniss never has to decide between the two. Katniss fights the whole time to free herself of being a pawn for the sadistic Capitol, yet in the end, she is just that, a pawn who never makes her own decisions. Utter Rubish.    The last few pages try to push the reader over the edge by depicting an act of epic evilness. I felt nothing. Well, maybe a twinge of emotion, but nothing that elicited the emotion that the first book was able to coax out of me. The whole book is this way. Characters are killed and instead of feeling for them, I find that I don't care. The only character that I cared for was Finnick. His death was marred by horrible writing and I ended up feeling swindled and angry rather than remorse and sorrow.    Now that I'm done with the Hunger Games trilogy I do not hate this book. I'm glad for the closure however bitterly ruined it might be. I highly recommend the first two books, the first being the highest as all I've learned and loved from the series happens there.
0439023513|2.0|SPOILERS----- MASSIVE SPOILERS---- You have been warned.    After the first two books, which I adored, I was absolutely giddy that the third book had finally come out and I raced home and read it in one day... and I hated it, sadly. You see, with the first book, we, the readers, were pretty much promised a bloodbath of twenty four contestants and if any of you have read Koushun Takami's Battle Royale, which Collin's Hunger Games can be easily compared with plot wise, then you know what type of carnage was basically in store for us, the readers.    But bloody carnage did not ensure. Actually, in Hunger Games, we don't even get to see half of the twenty-two participant's deaths and the few we do get to see are quite tame. Caught me completely off guard really. Where was the blood I had been promised? Instead, I got something I was completely not expecting. Romance... INCREDIBLY sappy teen romance, and I was even more taken aback because I loved it! It was brilliantly written! Love on the battlefield and this idealistic political subtext that would normally feel a book for young teen readers took a back seat as we were told a story about this poor girl dealing with the deadly threat of a boy crush. Mind blown.      The second book followed the same sappy romance formula to a degree as well. Constant tension building up to a grand finale and a cliffhanger ending. Sweet sweet love, o Romeo and Juliet and explosions!!!    Now, the third book breaks just entirely forgoes any semblance of the formula of the past two books in every conceivable way possible. Part of the intrigue in the first two books was wondering \\"what happens next?\\" but the twist was, Katniss ALREADY knew what happens next. She was just very forgetful in mentioning the next portions of her trips, her makeovers, etc. to the reader. She had already watched previous interviews, the  hunger games, the tours, etc so really, she already knew what to expect and all Collins had to do was not bring up the book's itinerary until the last possible moment. I thought this was quite clever. To have such a ditsy, messy character like Katniss and that reflected a lot on the story as well. Everything was blood and sweat, but in a somewhat teenage girl sort of way. Things change here... the story is, finally unknown. We have moved into uncharted territory filled with WAR!!! and this is where Collins fails miserably.     Gone is the lovey doveyness that surprised me in the first two books. After reading through both, Hunger Games and Catching Fire, expecting the story to turn in a bloodbath of epic proportions and that NOT happening, I really didn't expect Collins to turn leaf in her final chapter of what was shaping up to be a epic romance and get so brutal with the last book... yet she turns the knob to \\"MURDER EVERYONE EVER!!!!!!\\" It's just so... evil. I grew to be sympathetic with Katniss in completely different set of situations then what was occurring in the last book and Katniss never developed to cope as a character with these changing times, and changing themes. For the last part of a trilogy, you should probably keep similar themes, right? See, I learned to care about Katniss when she was whining about which boy she liked best, like reading her personal diary, only with blood stains, and now she is watching people she loves getting eaten alive and blown apart when these same characters had magical narrative and plot devices to save them from danger in the first two books.     Mockingjay boggles my mind as it concludes a trilogy by breaking the mold and running in the exact opposite direction of the first two books. It'd be like in Lord of the Rings, if a spaceship had suddenly appeared and Frodo had turned into a cyborg ninja and took on the entire army of Mordor. If Collins wanted to kill everyone, she should have done it in book two, where I was still expecting it to happen, but book three, all I have to say is: \\"Not cool\\".
1934356557|5.0|Do you know why polymorphism in the database is bad? Put your hand down if you're a DBA, this is for application developers :)    SQL Antipatterns is written in a very astute fashion and manages to be easy reading without being overly didactic - no small feat for a technical book.    The book is sectioned into the short (~10 pages) chapters, one for each antipattern. Each chapter is structured as such:    - intro context, often humorous    - OBJECTIVE/PROBLEM you're trying to accomplish/solve    - Antipattern that is a common pitfall    - How to recognize that pattern    - Legitimate uses of that antipattern    - Solution (the correct one) for your original OBJECTIVE/PROBLEM    One previous reviewer mentioned that the book covers relative basics for an experienced DBA or developer. Indeed, even if you've been developing for a short period chances are you've seen and/or know of maybe half of the antipatterns in this book. But I'd like to point this out: it's been my observation that experts in any field revel in reviewing the basics, even if just for fun. And this book is fun to read, which is why I suggest this could work just as fine on the coffee table as casual reading as it can on the bookshelf as a technical reference.      My only constructive criticism is that I wish there was more content. Database good practices is a very expansive subject, and as I was reading the book I couldn't help but wish the author was \\"building up to the good stuff\\" as some other PragProg books do. This book is reasonably priced so it remains good value, but if it was $40+ I might have gave it four stars instead of five for this reason.
0385341008|5.0|I was looking through the books again last weekend, and saw this book, The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Society by Mary Ann Shaffer and Annie Barrows.  The funny title is what caught my attention, and I wanted to find out more.  The book is a series of letters from the narrator, Juliet, to her friends in England, and members of a random book club in Guernsey, Channel Islands, after World War II.  I loved this book - the narrator, Juliet, is witty, silly and charming.  I learned a lot about the small island of Guernsey, which I had never heard of before reading this book.  The book is light hearted and easy to read, however, there are some very sad parts about the war as well. I highly recommend it - you could easily finish on a round trip plane ride (for the travelers out there). It's a little confusing for the first few pages, but then the letters continue to build on each other and after a few pages, you won't want to put it down.  For the cooks out there, Juliet references in the book that she used The Beginner's Cook-Book for Girl Guides.<br /><br />She writes:<br /><br />It was just the thing: the writer assumes you know nothing about cookery and writes useful hints - \\"when adding eggs, break the shells first.\\"<br />I googled this cookbook, but nothing came up, so I assume it is fictional. However, it made me laugh because I have some friends who could use a book like this.<br /><br />In the book, the setting is post WWII, so rations were still a part of everyday living. The book club in Guernsey bakes a Potato Peel Pie for their book club, because they only had a few ingredients.  The book doesn't go into tremendous detail on what this is, and I'm fairly certain this pie is also fictional, so I decided to make my version of \\"Potato Peel Pie\\" from a family recipe.  You can see my recipe I made at:<br />[...]

B001AQO3QA|1.0|While I don't own this product and I'm sure the series has made an incredible transfer to blu-ray I feel that it is probably most wise to wait for the individual releases of the films. Speaking in strictly aesthetic terms, the first two films are incredible and the later two are of extremely poor quality. What's the point in buying an entire series if only half of it is worth watching. This product is not for me, and I unfortunately will have to wait for standalone releases of Alien and Aliens.
B000002LIX|3.0|As a work of music, I prefer [[ASIN:B000002LEE Nothing's Shocking]] any day. Ritual De Lo Habitual is a bewildering mess, a formless blast of happy, upbeat noise. I think this is mostly due to Perry Farrell. On Nothing's Shocking his lyrics were arranged into tight and original rhythms, like the chorus of \\"Idiots Rule.\\" The album as a whole had more rhythmic discipline. But on Ritual De Lo Habitual, Farrell just yells over the music any way he wants, without any regard to the rhythm section. In the liner notes, the lyrics are written out in paragraph form, as prose, and that's exactly how his delivery makes them sound. The lyrics themselves feature many disconnected statements such as, \\"Stop! Here we go!\\" or \\"Ain't no right! Ain't no wrong now, ain't no right!\\" (Though that isn't all there is; see below.)    When his voice is not present, the music occasionally reveals some highlights -- a fine (if brief) solo from Dave Navarro on \\"Stop!\\" or a lyrical guitar line in the beginning of \\"Three Days,\\" or the complex, funky beat underlying \\"Been Caught Stealing,\\" which could be killer dance music in a different setting. But even so, that's not quite on the level of Nothing's Shocking, which has some sort of musical hook in every single song, even the throwaway instrumental. Ritual De Lo Habitual just has less form. \\"Three Days\\" is a long, multi-segmented epic in the style of classic rock, but the sections don't feel connected to me. The loud crescendo is a clunky guitar grind, breaking suddenly out of the melancholy tone, lacking a memorable rhythm or solo. \\"Classic Girl\\" consists of wistful guitar chords, but again they're not arranged into a memorable hook (unlike, say, even the simplistic jangle of \\"Jane Says\\").    Overall I'd pick two songs as being musically interesting: \\"Stop!\\" with its attention-grabbing breaks and stop-start dynamics, and \\"Of Course,\\" which might possibly push the band's musical boundaries more than any other Jane's song, with exotic Middle Eastern-sounding strings played in waltz-time. \\"Been Caught Stealing\\" is adorable and fun, with the best part occurring during the break when you can actually hear the rhythm section. The rest is one big loud blur.    But here's the thing. Sometimes, even a glaring flaw can become a strength. Yes, Ritual De Lo Habitual is messy and incoherent...but this actually turns it into spectacular summer listening. [[ASIN:B000000P2K Jane's Addiction]] are possibly the best summertime band in rock history. Especially in the [[ASIN:B000003TAR gloomy]], [[ASIN:B0000028M7 angst-ridden]] world of nineties American alt-rock, they stand out as being just about the only band with a blatant, fierce love of life, which is also expressed in a way that encourages empathy toward others. [[ASIN:B000002G2B Soundgarden]] are also great for rockin' out, but they're still beholden to grunge angst templates. I can't think of a rock song that paints a nicer, more sympathetic portrait than Perry Farrell's rambling lines, \\"Gives her man great ideas, hears you tell your friends, 'hey man, listen to my great idea!' Such a classic girl...\\" Again, there's not much of a pop hook to these lines, or in the instrumentation, but man, that particular wording has a way of staying with listeners. On a lazy summer afternoon, when it's so hot and bright outside, there is no better music than a big, loud, happy blur.    That's not to say that all the songs are happy. \\"Three Days\\" is quite low-key at first, and \\"Then She Did...\\" is apparently about Farrell's mother's suicide (though it's difficult to figure out what he's singing without reading the liner notes). \\"Of Course\\" is actually (again, if you read the liner notes) a somber meditation on people's tendency to treat each other badly, complete with an evocative childhood memory. But even these serious moments don't sound oppressive. They're more like a gentle calm, retaining the album's generally optimistic tone. Well, even better -- what summer doesn't leave behind melancholy memories when it's over?    Nothing's Shocking is also a great summer album, and even contains a song called \\"Summertime Rolls.\\" Aesthetically I think it's superior, and I often find that Ritual De Lo Habitual drags a bit in comparison...but still, it is able to leave one with a really warm feeling. It's hard to pinpoint the exact reasons why, but it cements this band's place as one of the most interesting acts in all of American alt-rock.
B00422LESE|2.0|I won't comment on the written content of this book. The book description says this ebook has a file size of 9Mb and other digital editions of this book can be found at online bookstores at around the same size. After buying and downloading it, I was surprised to see it take up less than 2Mb. I immediately suspected the worst and took a look at the many beautiful pictures in the book. Indeed, visible artifacts regularly show up because the images have been compressed too much! What a shame, especially for a newly released ebook. I'm very disappointed!

B0036TGSR6|4.0|This film was intriguing but I felt like I didn't get enough information, like there were holes missing. It may be just me, it had really good suspense and acting, yet the leads didn't seem to bring closure to me. Its about a former Prime Minister who is being thrown in the media for committing war crimes. Before this happens he has a ghost writer writing his memoirs, who unfortunately dies in a drowning that has some possible funny business written on it. In walks Ewan, the next ghost writer picking up the slack. He is very straight forward, not really evocative in his speech or manner, a person who is quiet and inward. He finds clues that cause him to ponder, did the other writer possibly get murdered. During that time his subject is being whisked away to Washington to respond to the allegations of possible terrorist suspects being tortured. The prime minister is visibly shaken and his wife who plays a strong regal woman, seems overwrought over his not following her guidance. He usually follows her advice she tells Ewan's character. Things get more involved with the couple Ewan is learning and writing about. He finds out secret information which leads to more intrigue. It is confusing did the Prime Minister get involved with the CIA before becoming a Prime Minister, or was it just his spouse involved in a triage of deceit? Was the Minister used by his wife and her tutor Emmet to be placed the role of Prime Minister in Great Britain? Did they manipulate a carefree actor who chased women by using a love interest to attract him on their path instead of his own, made by conscious choice? These are questions. Later on, was he set up somehow with the crimes, used, than taken out of commision on purpose as was his friend the first ghostwriter? Did the first writer have pertinent information to leak to the Minister before his death? Again lots of contemplation from this mystical raindrenched movie. The things I liked about this film were the beautiful glass encased room showing the long stretch of beach with sea grassy dunes spread out like a visual feast, the beauty of the compactness the house reflected, the big sandwich that Ewan had made for him by the housekeeper, the super quiet storybook hotel, with the little hostess dressed as a swiss maid and I liked the job Ewan had. It seemed like it would be fun to write and have all the accessories that came with the career. He also had the opportunity to meet people who were interesting and find out things that were something not everybody has privy to. Polanski's movies are very well done and keep an audience captive.

B002ZG9968|2.0|From my wife Sarah: All I kept thinking was - how could Jennifer Lopez have agreed to make this movie? It was boring, slow, silly and just completely unbelievable.<br /><br />Actually I don't even mind when a movie is unbelievable if it has something entertaining, interesting, funny or thought provoking. But this was a TERRIBLE script with lots of cliches. There were parts that were meant to be funny but were utterly rediculous. The romance part was absolutely unbelievable, and on a scale of 1-10, chemistry was about zero. Jennifer - you're so much better than that! I hope you'll have better movies in your future. Unfortunately I can't recommend this movie.
0439023483|5.0|I loved Hunger Games and Catching Fire. They are an engrossing read and Suzanne Collins skillfully keeps you turning pages until...OMG...where is book three, the Mokingjay? Talk about your major cliff hangers. When I finally marked off enough days, weeks, months on my calander and got Mokingjay in the mail, I was a lunatic to find out how it all ends. Literally read it in about 5 hours. Katniss Everdeen is a totally believable herion in a completely believable, but frightening future. Collins is a master storyteller taking current societal themes and weaving them into a terrifying post apocolyptic future in which Katniss must somehow conquer all. The love triangle in this book is one that inspires true angst. Both of Katniss's suiters are equally wonderful and the reader is hard pressed to decide on a favorite. Lukily, she knows her own mind there too! Mokingjay is an approptiately exciting, nail biting, climax to the series and at no time disappoints. Can't wait to see what Collins comes up with next.
0596806027|3.0|General    The book is giving good background information in several chapters (\\"How Did We Get Here?\\", video etc.). In this sense it is not a cookbook \\"for dummies\\".     On the other hand, in other aspects it does look a bit like \\"for dummies\\". In some cases it gives an introduction but does not dive deep into details. The code examples explain basically every line of code, even if the same line (or a very similar one) appeared in the example one page before. It is good if you are just diving into a specific example without prior knowledge, however it does get a bit annoying if you are reading a whole chapter, example by example.    IMHO the book is not critical at all towards HTML5. As I read it (and I did not have any previous knowledge of HTML5), a number of serious questions arose in my mind concerning several features of HTML5. Many of these were not dealt with at all, others were mentioned in a few lines towards the end of the chapter. I would expect such a book to deal also with (potential) shortcomings of HTML5.    Recommendation    I am not a web designer/developer but rather a web/software architect, so my point of view is somewhat different than that of developers. Because of that, it's difficult for me to say if I should recommend the book to web developers. One thing I am certain of: I would not buy the print version. Besides saving the rain forest, there are two reasons for that. One is that many hyperlinks to various resources are strewn all over the book, and typing these over is a pain. The other is that as HTML5 is still work in progress, also as far as browser and tool support is concerned, it gets easily out of date. The book was written in May-June 2010, and I reviewed it in August-September. I could already find a few cases when the browser/add-on/tool referred by the author had a newer version. The author maintains a website of updates, but if you need to access the site you might as well use the eBook.    Chapter 1 How Did We Get Here?     Starts at the very beginning. The historic introduction can be for many of the young-generation developers tedious, lengthy and unnecessary, though as an old-school fellow I did find it interesting.    Chapter 2 Detecting HTML5 Features    All in all, a good introduction to HTML5 features. The most important quote of this chapter: \\"HTML5 is not one big thing; it is a collection of individual features\\".     The security question concerning local storage (same-origin restriction) - spot-on!    Webworkers, offline web application - neat features.    Chapter 3 What Does It All Mean?    Explanations are really from scratch, and even trivial HTML / javascript code is explained.    Good examination of the importance of semantic elements i.s.o. general-purpose elements such as <div id=\\"\\"> (meaningless) or <... class=\\"\\">  (only for rendering, but not semantic).    Chapter 4 Let's Call It a Draw(ing Surface)    Thorough explanation of basic Canvas functionality. Again, keep explaining every little detail.    Chapter 5 Video on the Web    Excellent overview of video containers, video and audio codecs.    Lengthy discussion and demo how to convert your video to all formats.    Chapter 6 You Are Here (And So Is Everybody Else)    Good chapter, good explanation of geolocation and immediately the spot-on question of geolocation and privacy.     Good explanation of geolocation API (getCurrentPosition() and watchPosition()), and of high accuracy (GPS) - pros and cons - in mobile devices.    Chapter 7 The Past, Present, and Future of Local Storage for Web Applications    This chapter can be improved.     The whole security issue is insufficiently covered. To start with, the explanation about cookies disadvantages from security point of view is lacking - it's not only an encryption issue, cookies are vulnerable for both hijacking by a 3rd party AND for manipulation by the user itself.    I miss an entire discussion of security aspects of local storage. This was touched very briefly in chapter 2 (same-origin restriction) and that's it. But how does HTML5 / browsers guarantee that one domain does not mess around with the values of another (read or write)? How do they guarantee that the user himself does not manipulate the values to get something he doesn't deserve? What should web developers be aware of? These issues are very important for every application which uses local storage. Even a game application would want to prevent the user from \\"promoting\\" themselves from level 5 to level 23 by manipulating a couple of local storage variables.    Local storage data is stored as key-value pairs of strings. This is really limiting, IMHO, especially if you want to save the whole state of a more complex application. Here I would expect a more critical view on HTML5, which standardized the key-value pairs but not a database solution. I would also like to see a more deep comparison of the other options (Web SQL database vs. Indexed DB). At least there's a good reference.    Chapter 8 Let's Take This Offline    This chapter also lacks a critical view on HTML5. I find the caching mechanism too rigid. This issue is referred to only at the end of the chapter, but IMHO is a big flaw in the caching mechanism.    The caching mechanism is \\"all or nothing\\". I.e. if a single page (referred to by the cache manifest) is modified, then one has to artificially modify the cache manifest (e.g. by editing a \\"version\\" comment line), and then ALL of the files are being redownloaded. This is an ugly workaround and it is simply stupid!     The rigid caching mechanism is actually suitable only for pure static-content websites, which change only when they are authored or edited. Of course, if you have a lot of dynamic-content pages then caching won't give you much, but imagine a situation where most of your site is static. Let's say, that only one frame in my home page should be dynamic as I want to display there my latest Twitter status; the rest of my site is all static. With HTML5, I cannot tell the app to redownload only that page. Grrrr.    I also miss here a mention of Google Gears caching mechanism for offline apps, which preceded HTML5.    Chapter 9 A Form of Madness    Here, again, the most important issue is touched only at the end of the chapter. I am talking about the validation of specific input types (e.g. email, URL, number) by the browser - currently supported only by Opera.    This is IMHO much more important for web developers than the (marginal) user experience gain with iPhone specialized \\"keyboards\\". The validation of email addresses is discussed in length, whereas that of URL is at least as complicated (see also: [...].    Chapter 10 \\"Distributed,\\" \\"Extensibility,\\" and Other Fancy Words    Also here I miss a shape critical look on HTML5 microdata. It looks to me as a rather bleak attempt to implement semantics into HTML. Its data model is limited to name-value pairs, and it hangs on the existing HTML DOM structure (not to mention that it requires workarounds of dummy elements such as <span>).     I know that HTML5 probably cannot support a generic <rant> element, but it does not even try. What I would ideally like to see is a mechanism which takes a well-defined semantic XML fragment (based on an XML schema), and together with some XSLT and CSS can render it as HTML.    Microdata can be nested, but it is not as nearly as semantically powerful as an XML schema. In other words, it cannot validate that Person.address is indeed of type Address. It does not have a schema, all it has is a free text description (or documentation). We cannot validate correctness of types, and we cannot enforce that a specific property has a value (or the cardinality of the values).    Annotation of HTML-invisible data with microdata (<meta> tags) is especially ugly. With an XML schema + XSLT it would have been much more natural. The schema determines the semantic data, the XSLT determines what is displayed and what not.     Microdata is comparable to Twitter annotations ([...]). Both have similar data model - type (namespace) and name-value pairs. However Twitter annotations are produced by applications and consumed by applications. Control on validation and correctness is much more centralized. HTML5 microdata is authored by millions of webmasters and consumed by either browsers or search engines. There is no control on validation, and the added value is IMHO doubtful.    \\"It's up to you to provide as much data as possible, as accurately as possible\\", says the book. But you get no tools to validate! The costs of maintaining this microdata and validating its correctness (just for the sake of search engines which do not even guarantee to display it) is way too big for organizations to invest in it. I can already vision the poor webmaster, explaining over and over again to their boss \\"I don't know why Google doesn't show my microdata, but it's not guaranteed that they would do so\\", only to find months later that they have made a mistake with some property name.    If the justification for microdata is search engines, these would have had a much easier time with parsing valid XML elements.    A technical question is what the attribute itemscope is doing and why is it needed to declare the scope of the microdata dictionary? it doesn't get any value and seems redundant; if we define itemtype for a specific element, then this can also serve as stating that the current element is the scope for that type, isn't it?    Appendix The All-in-One Almost-Alphabetical Guide to Detecting Everything    Useful, however contains elements not discussed elsewhere in the book.      Disclosure: I have received the book from the publisher for free, in exchange for reviewing it.

0399156577|3.0|This book was effectively ruined for me by whichever marketing `genius' wrote the tag line on the front cover (trade paperback edition): \\"Alone in the woods surrounded by danger...\\". That, together with the book's title, set up the expectation in my mind that at some point one of the major characters was going to be lost in the woods, the subject of a desperate search. I spent large chunks of the book expecting that to happen, and the latter stages distracted by the fact that Roberts was running out of pages to fit it in.     It's not that I'm a fan of \\"chase-the-poor-helpless-heroine-through-the-wilderness\\" type stories. Instead the problem was that that tag line meant that I read the whole book wondering when the preamble and scene-setting and process of establishing the characters was going to finish and the `real'story was going to start, as advertised.     Needless to say, it never did. The only characters genuinely \\"alone in the woods\\" at any point are two of the people whom heroine Fiona and her canine search and rescue team go looking for. One (3-year-old Hugh Cauldwell) is found as early as page 12, and the other (Alzheimer's sufferer Walter Deets) we never actually meet at all. The story never gives us the point of view, or puts us in the place of someone lost or the subject of a search. It's like one of those movie trailers that include scenes which don't actually make it into the final film.    Okay, I'm sure that someone out there is going to try and point out that the book's title is supposed to be metaphorical or something. That \\"the search\\" in question is, say, Fiona's search for happiness, closure and peace of mind. Fine. But I still can't get past the misdirection of that tag line effectively promising something that wasn't delivered.    It doesn't help that the book is really just a shaggy dog story (no pun intended). Large chunks of the plot feel like filler - nice background detail (Roberts, like Stephen King, has a reasonable ear for the minutiae of every-day life), but not essential to the narrative drive. Boil it all down and not a lot actually happens: the heroine and hero start a relationship (which is barely tested thereafter), some cute dogs get trained, the heroine hangs out with her friends, the hero does some woodwork, the heroine works on three search and rescue operations (the two mentioned previously, plus a third which at least goes into a bit more detail, but basically achieves nothing more than allowing the hero and heroine to get to know each other better). Oh, and somewhere in the background a serial killer with an interest in our heroine lurks. His predations do result in psychological stress and trauma for Fiona, but she faces little in the way of physical danger (there's a `blink and you'll miss it' - less than 2 pages in fact -confrontation at the end and that's it).     I'm a fan of Roberts, don't get me wrong. I'll read her fluffy romances when I want something light. I'm not quite so fond of the supernatural stories (though the Key Trilogy is nevertheless a favourite). But I really like the strand of her writing that employs a modern setting, with a professional, capable heroine trying to make her way (Blue Smoke, Angel's Fall, Black Hills, etc). By those standards, this was a disappointment.
B002GZQYMK|4.0|I purchased Absolution several years ago, and borrowed a couple other Muse albums from a friend, and I always loved their sound; I could just never get past the lead singer's constant gasping for air after every line of every song. It irritated me so much that I actually vowed to never buy another Muse album again.<br /><br />Well, I didn't buy Resistance (yet), but I've borrowed it from my younger brother, and have listened to it all the way through several times already. The great Muse sound is still there, but the gasping is finally gone, and from every track, too! There are clunkers on this album, though, like \\"United States Of Eurasia\\" where Muse tries to go all Queen on you but, if you've been leery of Muse because of the gasping issue, this is the album to get. You'll enjoy it.

B002VECLVY|5.0|Tom Ford's \\"A Single Man\\" is a most impressive film debut by one of America's premier fashion stylists. Not settling for merely getting all of the surface details of early 60's Cuban missile crisis America absolutely correct, from wardrobe to hairstyles to interior decor, Ford elicits career-defining, meticulous and deeply felt performances from Oscar nominee Colin Firth and a superlatively needy yet supportive Julianne Moore as two Brits in self imposed exile in Los Angeles. Aiming for and hitting the universality of \\"losing a loved one\\" note, and aided immeasurably by Abel Kortzeniowski's evocative score, Ford, Firth and Moore delicately balance restraint with the occasional well timed outburst. The texts and subtexts of university, suburban and sexual lives are captured in perfectly cast and rendered roles by Matthew Goode, Nicholas Hoult (\\"About a Boy\\"-all grown up)and in a notable cameo as a Spanish would-be James Dean, Jon Kortajarena. Frankly, the Blu-ray disc captures the subdued color palette with a clarity that is more satisfying than my several viewings of the theatrical version.

Expertly directed, written, photographed, performed and scored,\\"Writer\\" is best described as a political thriller with existential overtones. Set mostly on a slate grey and damp German coast standing in for Massachusetts, the film shows Ewan McGregor's nameless title character morphing into a detective seeking to uncover the truth about his predecessor's death and the extremely convoluted backstory of former British Prime Minister Adam Lang. Given Pierce Brosnan's diabolically seductive impersonation, it will be impossible to look at Tony Blair on his current book tour and not see the elegant former James Bond in his (Blair's) stead. The breakout performance of the film is given by Olivia Williams as Lang's brilliantly devious and constantly surprising wife. Even with its heavy dose of thematic and visual fatalism, this film merits repeated viewings.
B002UXRGLG|5.0|If you are considering purchase of this fantastic film documentary, MOST DEFINITELY purchase the original BBC broadcast version narrated by David Attenborough.  Having viewed portions of the US version as \\"dictated\\" by an often smug and slurring Winfrey, I quickly ordered the real deal. The difference is, of course, the voice of a knowing and learned narrator as opposed to a lecturing and somewhat disinterested monotone reader.  The visuals are the same in both editions.

0307341550|4.0|After reading Flynn's second book, Dark Places, earlier this year I couldn't get enough of her and wanted to read her first book.  Like I said in my review of Dark Places, if Flynn writes more (and I hope she does) then she has a loyal fan in me.  While Sharp Objects doesn't quite have the intensity that Dark Places showed us, it's still just as good.<br /><br />In it, we meet Camille Preaker, a Chicago reporter who returns to her hometown of Wind Gap, Missouri to look into the story of two young teen girls who went missing and were later found dead and missing all of their teeth.  The local police have no leads and have called in help from Kansas City to assist in the investigation.  Locals have their own suspicions and small town gossips abounds.<br /><br />But Flynn doesn't serve us just another cookie cutter mystery.  Much of the book is about Camille attempting to reconnect with her well-to-do Mom who owns the local pig abattoir, Mom's stiff squeaky husband, and her bizarre attention-hungry young sister named Amma. As Camille jumps head first into the case and attempts to get a good quote on record from the parents of the deceased or the Kansas City investigator, she rediscovers what she reminisces of her years growing up in the smalltown of Wind Gap and we learn more about her and the pain she has lived.  Camille is a cutter, carving various words literally all over her body.  And to make things worse, her Mom is a hypochondriac.<br /><br />I had the killer pegged as soon as I met them, but constantly second guessed myself as Flynn leads you away from the mystery at hand and deeper into the psyche of Camille, her sister, and her mother.  Camille pays visits to the girls she grew up with and went to high school with, desperate to break something in the case, but in the process it all comes back to her sad mother and her bully sister, who apparently rules the school with her pretentious attitude.  Camille also develops a physical relationship with the investigator who refuses to budge on giving Camille something she can use in her story.<br /><br />Just like Flynn's second book, the characters here are all ticking time bombs of emotion and turmoil.  You love them.  You hate them.  You love to hate them.  In fact, you become so emotionally attached to them yourself that you just can't put the book down.  Throw in a gritty murder mystery to solve and you have the perfect recipe for a book that I just can't stop thinking about.on giving Camille something she can use in her story.

B002ZG98UA|1.0|First, a precursor to my thoughts. Yes, I enjoyed the \\"Resident Evil\\" video games as much as the next guy. I, however, was able to completely separate my feelings for the games, from my feelings for the movies. I didn't expect characters to stop once an hour and mess around with a typewriter in order to save their progress. I don't care that the movies don't follow the game's storyline. I knew going in to the first film that it was simply based on the game's likeness, and not meant to be a companion piece. I would also like to state that, unlike my partner in crime, I enjoyed the third film. I was perfectly aware that it was the weakest in the series up to that point, but was still able to enjoy it for the brain dead popcorn action flick that it was. I have no biases going into \\"Resident Evil: Afterlife\\". I wasn't going into the film looking for things to hate. I just wanted to be entertained. So before anyone tries to discredit my opinion with such silly arguments, realize that you are wasting your breath.<br /><br />\\"Resident Evil: Afterlife\\" picks up where \\"Extinction\\" left off. The survivors are en route via chopper, to a supposed sanctuary in Alaska. Alice is on her way to the underground Umbrella headquarters with her army of clones. The opening scene leads the viewer to believe that there is going to be non-stop, gore soaked badassery. Despite it clearly borrowing(heavily) from every other action film made since John Woo's \\"The Killer\\", Alice and her clones destroying a massive army of Umbrella foot soldiers was exciting to watch. Blood and body parts drenched the screen, and we felt like we were in for a hell of a good time. If you're planning on seeing this movie, hit a matinee up, and leave after this scene ends, because after this, it becomes completely incoherent, and somehow, in a world completely overrun by the walking dead, I found myself bored.<br /><br />For a movie about zombies, the scenes involving zombies are practically non existent. A good portion of the film is set on top of a building surrounded by hundreds of thousands of the undead, so one would think that this horde is going to be utilized at some point throughout. One would be wrong. Aside from a very brief encounters with the diverse cast of characters, and some off-screen kills, the zombies are used as a backdrop. A means to justify making a zombie movie, but never turns into a tangible entity.<br /><br />One thing I did enjoy about this film is the 3D. Those of you that have ever spoken to me will know, that this is really saying something. The 3D boom as of late has left a bad taste in my mouth. Films that have no business being in 3D(Step Up?) are being churned out by the metric f**kton. I think filmmakers would do themselves a service to claim beforehand, whether the film was originally intended to be in 3D, or if it was converted afterward to be so. Before \\"RE:A\\" my last 3D experience was with Alexandre Aja's \\"Piranha\\" remake. While there were a couple of scenes that made the 3D aspect of the film interesting(Piranha burping a penis toward the screen) for the most part it was headache inducing. Long, background heavy wide shots have no business being in 3D, it does not make for a pleasurable experience. The only film I had seen at the theater in this new 3D technology that I had enjoyed up until this point was the remake of \\"My Bloody Valentine\\". The 3D in \\"RE:A\\" is very impressive. It blows away every other attempt at 3D cinema. The \\"RE\\" films have always looked gorgeous. Crisp, clear picture, with ultra popping colors, and supreme elements of detail have always made these films stand out. The original \\"RE\\" film on DVD looks better upscaled than a lot of Blu-Rays. Couple that with competent 3D technology, cinematography, and knowing when and why to use 3D, and you have a genuinely good experience. It's too bad that the film it's self was so terrible, otherwise this would have been the ultimate popcorn movie.<br /><br />The one unforgivablemistake a film like this can make is to be boring. Aside from a couple of entertaining scenes, \\"RE:A\\" manages to be completely boring. It's hard to condemn a \\"Resident Evil\\" film for being unoriginal, but I think one of the main reasons it fails is because of the fore mentioned heavy borrowing from other films. Had the matrix style slow motion scenes been removed from the movie, it probably would have subtracted 20 minutes at least from the run time. One scene in particular brings the entire film to a halt, completely pauses, and then spins around showing us various angles of nothing happening. It's completely unnecessary. There are several scenes that were lifted directly from the matrix. One scene in particular that is shown in the film's trailers is a scene where our lead character dives out of a window backwards, and dual fires guns in bullet time, dodging falling glass. The film is riddled with this nonsense all throughout, and actually becomes even more unbearable in the final act. Something else you may recognize is the creatures look an awfully lot like the super vampires from \\"Blade 2\\" face splitting and all. I am aware that these are based on characters from the game, but they could have done a better job with the design. When Ted and I came out of the theater, I told him I thought Paul W.S. Anderson got really stoned one night, watched The Matrix, and Blade II, passed out and woke up the next day with a head full of ideas.<br /><br />The acting is fine for the most part, but Shawn Roberts puts in a nauseatingly terrible performance as Albert Wesker. It may not be his fault, he may have just been told to give the camera his best Agent Smith impression, regardless, it's so bad that even if you've enjoyed the movie otherwise it will kill the mood for you.<br /><br />If your film already has an R rating, why not use it? Despite a few random F-bombs here and there, and a couple of scenes of graphic beheadings at the beginning, the film is virtually bloodless. A lot of the deaths/kills are off-screen. There IS however, a very cool headshot. Brain matter flies at your face, and I must give credit where credit is due, that as pretty badass. Other than that though, there aren't any graphic deaths, Mila doesn't go gearless. The whole affair probably could have been given a really hard PG-13 if it weren't for the random F-bombs. If you've already went through the trouble of alienating the 12 year old demographic, why not give the audience you are now catering to what they want? I'm not saying more gore would have saved this terrible, terrible movie, but it couldn't have hurt.<br /><br />\\"Resident Evil: Afterlife\\" may well be one of the worst films I've seen all year. It doesn't deliver any of the things that we've come to expect from the franchise. The previous films were never high art, but they were entertaining, which is the purpose of movies to begin with. If you can't hook your core audience, who are you making your film for? I'm giving this film a 3/10, which is fairly liberal. If it weren't for the excellent 3D effects, it would probably be closer to 1.5/10.<br /><br />3/10<br /><br />-Shawn Savage<br /><br />[...]e is to be boring.

The Stones are still going because they have talent. How many bands have been going for 50 years and still can sell out football stadiums and have their fans luv them. When Rapp or any other specific artist has done what the Rolling Stones have then they should be allowed to judge. BUY THIS CD AND ENJOY...
B003L1ZWG2|4.0|Upon the release of the campy slasher sub-genre tribute \\"Hatchet\\", director Adam Green because a horror movie rockstar, practically overnight. Some say he deserves it, some say the opposite. Regardless, Green had instantly become a household name. \\"Frozen\\" wasn't treated with the same level of hype that \\"Hatchet\\" was. So far, the biggest push for the film's success has come in the form of positive reviews across the horror blogosphere. In the interest of full disclosure, I hate it when people compare films to \\"Jaws\\". Any time I see \\"Does for blah blah blah what Jaws did for blah blah blah\\", I instantly want to hate the film. I think it's a tired comparison, but maybe that's just a peronsal pet peeve. If I were to compare the film to anything, I would say it's \\"Open Water\\" on a ski lift. That may or may not sound appealing to you, but it really is an example of solid film making.<br /><br />\\"Frozen\\" follows three friends as they visit a mountain resort for some skiing/snowboarding. Not having enough money for all three of them to purchase ski lift tickets, the girl of the group sweet talks the lift operator into a discount price. Arriving late in the day, and spending most of their time on the bunny slopes, the trio talk the operator into letting them go up the mountain one more time, even though they are shutting down the mountain for the week. After granting their request, the need to take a leak causes him to pass the proverbial torch to another employee, he makes sure and tells him to not shut it down till the last three come down the hill, unfortunately, there are actually three on the hill, and three still on the lift. After the operator sees three skiiers clearing the bottom of the hill, he shuts the lift down, and begins to shut the lights down for the long week. Our three friends are now trapped in mid-air, and have just realized that there will be nobody to save them till the following Friday.<br /><br />If you're looking for a brutal hack and slash, campy slasher, or grizzly revenge tale, you're looking in the wrong place. \\"Frozen\\" is terrorizing from a psychological standpoint. Yes, there are some cringe inducing moments, but they take a backseat to the overwhelming sense of dread. It's quite an accomplishment to take a concept such as three people stranded on a ski lift in the middle of it's run, and keep people on the edge of their seats. Jaws references aside, this is exactly what Green does. The range of emotions that are portrayed by the characters are cognate to those that one would feel if in the same situation. Add the isolation to the height, and the harsh weather conditions, and it creates an absolutely dreadful scenario.<br /><br />Luckily for us, Green insisted on filming everything practically. This means, not only are scenes of body damage genuine, and lacking in CG, but there is no green screen to give the actors a sense of relief while filming. Personally, I think this added to the performances, dangling in the air would have to increase one's sense of anxiety, which pays off well when that is what the actor is trying to relay to the audience. Not to mention that the few moments of gore presented in the film are that much better. Some filmmakers don't realize what a difference this makes. Sure, in some cases CG may be easier on your budget, but if it's handled poorly(which most instances of CGI are) it takes the viewer out of the film. It's hard to create a creepy atmosphere, or dreadful, tense situations when your audience is busy laughing at your cartoony, piss-poor excuse for special effects.<br /><br />The acting is superb across the board. Emma Bell, who has scored a role on AMC's upcoming comic-based zombie epic \\"The Walking Dead' turns in a particularly convincing performance as Parker, the intruding girlfriend. Emma brings a sense of authenticity to her role, and I look forward to seeing what she can do in the fore mentioned series. Shawn Ashmore, who some may remember as Iceman in the X-Menmovies, or for the horror buffs, he played Eric in \\"The Ruins\\", puts in a pitch perfect performance as the  quirky, jealous best friend.Kevin Zegers, whom some may recognize from the \\"Air Bud\\" movies, or more to the point, Evan, from \\"Wrong Turn\\" plays the boyfriend trying to keep the peace between his girlfriend, and his best friend. Also making an appearance as a staff member of the ski spot is Kane Hodder. It's a hell of a cast, and they work well together to create a genuinely terrifying cinematic experience.<br /><br />Despite the lack of hype this time around, I was worried that \\"Frozen\\" would get a little more praise than it deserved. I enjoyed \\"Hatchet\\" as much as the next slasher fan, but there are those out there that treat it as the holy grail of horror. \\"Frozen\\" proves to me that there's a superbly talented filmmaker within Adam Green, and I look forward to his more serious entries into the genre. \\"Frozen\\" is a slow burning, psychologically terrifying film, so it may not be for everyone. Fans of \\"Hatchet\\" will most likely be disappointed if they're going into this picture expecting the same level of comedic campiness. Fans of slow paced thrillers, almost in a Hitchcockian sense will be pleasantly surprised. I am comfortable to highly recommend \\"Frozen\\" . Actually, if you have the means, pick up the Blu ray when it drops on September 28th. The picture, filmed in 35mm really pops in it's crisp full 1080p presentation.<br /><br />9/10<br /><br />-Shawn Savage<br /><br />[...]ffs, he played Eric in \\"The Ruins\\", puts in a pitch perfect performance as the  quirky, jealous best friend.Kevin Zegers, whom some may recognize from the \\"Air Bud\\" movies, or more to the point, Evan, from \\"Wrong Turn\\" plays the boyfriend trying to keep the peace between his girlfriend, and his best friend.

B001F3FUK6|3.0|Spoiler ALERT!!! Superman went away to seek his planet and returned after five years. As soon as he returns he went back doing his own thing, fighting bad guys. Lex, arch enemy of Superman, had something in his mind to rule the world which is a very typical plot of every villain for this movie. Nothing really special went on for this movie, I mean you have the bad guys doing bad stuff and some bad scenarios going on where Superman can't beat or solve. Then the movie gave some clue that Lois Lane gave birth to Superman's son - this was the story I would like to know more but the movie ended with Superman saying good night to his son.
1590710487|4.0|Belushi tells through recollections of those who know and worked with him the tale of the rise and fall of John Belushi. He was a man who craved fame but was torn down by it. He was forced to grow up young due to his home life, and as a result he never really grew up, clearly evidenced by the many memories of him acting as a boy would act in situations that really called for a man. Contrasting these instances are those stories where he manned up and did what needed to be done for his family or his work. As one who was always there for everyone else, it seems almost like he never cared enough for himself to ask others to help.     The photos and stories in this book are fantastic, many never previously seen by the public. The intimate retellings of private encounters and interactions with this comedic genius are wonderful reading. The self-destructive bent he acquired to cope with the stress of his unparalleled success is seen to evolve through the telling, with Belushi only trying to return from the brink after passing too close to its edge.     There were only a few minor quality-control issues with this fantastic work, most prominent being the typo in the footer for an entire chapter. Outside of that and a few other typos here and there, the book is wonderful.

B001O2ZW1A|4.0|Wilson is best known as the leader of modern progressive rock band Porcupine Tree.  He is also a producer with quite a few album credits to his name.  \\"Insurgencies\\" is Wilson's first attempt at a completely solo album.  All the material was written by Wilson and with the exception of a few guests here and there the majority of the instruments are performed by him too.  As one might expect the album is very similar in style and content with that of his main band Porcupine Tree.  Is \\"Insurgencies\\" as good as a regular Porcupine Tree release?  I would say no, but it is prime Steven Wilson with material that ranges from good to great.  As with anything that Wilson touches, the production is flawless.  The songwriting here is pretty typical Wilson fare as well, with mostly downbeat lyrics with dark themes.  The album is not as poppy as some of Wilson's other side projects like Blackfield, but there is a bit more emphasis on shorter songs that might be slightly more commercial than with Porcupine Tree.  The album all seems to blend together to my ears and there are no real individual tracks that really stand out which is not necessarily a criticism.  As a whole this is a very nice album from Mr. Wilson and though not quite on the same level as his Porcupine Tree release should be a satisfying listen for fans of Steven's other work.
B002QGUFWE|1.0|It has been my previous experience that CD's that have censored lyrics carry an 'edited' notation. Be warned, Amazon does not list this disc as edited, but it is. 3 songs on 'The fame Monster' disc are edited. The 3 tracks that are censored are, 'Bad Romance', 'Monster', and 'Dance In The Dark'. Amazon should list this 2 disc set as edited, but they don't. Know what you are buying before you buy. Also of note, even the single disc is edited, unless it is the Australian import, which is virtually impossible to get your hands on.

They also has great music in this movie, the song I couldn't get out of my head, This is our song, is my favorite.  We don't know how well the soundtrack will do, good luck.  Demi Lovato character did an amazing job in this movie, her character Mitchie was leading a revolution to save Camp Rock and she succeded.  She was like Susan B. Anthony, who fought for women's right to vote and Harriet Tubman who fought to end slavery.  The Jonas Brother are really cool, Joe Jonas character Shane used to be an arrogant jerk, when she started datie Mitchie.  He changed a lot, became a nice guy and a slacker.  This time they include and Kevin and Nick in the show.  Nick Jonas has a love interest in the movie Chloe Bridges.  Everyone knows who Chloe Bridges is, she played Freddie Prinze's Jr Niece on Freddie.  Freddie was a spin off of George Lopez Show.  Nick and Chloe characters are like Romeo and Juliet, two rival camps fighting camps against each other, it sounds like a shakespeare play.  Newcomer Chloe Bridges from the disney world has the greatest resemblance of Jacqueline Obradors, the lady who played her mother on Freddie and Demi Lovato.  Demi Lovato has the greatest resemblance of The House Bunny Emma Stone and Mission Impossilbe III Michelle Monaghan. She came along from this movie that started at all that made her superstar.  Every one knows as Charlotte Adams from As the Bell rings a short segement on disney, from Sonny Monroe at Sonny with a chance and Rosie Gonzalez from Princess Protection Program and two cd's that made her famous and superstardom. Nick Jonas looks like Wizards of Waverly Place David Henrie and Joe Jonas has the greatest resemblance of Taylor Lautner.  Joe Jonas is the like teen heartthrob of this movie.  Good luck watching this movie, I watched it was amazing.

B00004TS0E|5.0|An excellent version of this holiday classic.   This fresh script was moving, funny and as heartwarming as the 1947 Academy Award winning movie with Edmund Gwen and Natalie Wood.  I didn't think that was possible.  I enjoyed it very much.
B001QOGYFO|3.0|If you liked Aliens, The Abyss, The Thing or any other thriller that involved a group of people stuck in isolated surroundings in which a killer is on the loose, this movie should be right up your alley.  By no means a classic like similar movies, Whiteout delivers a good mystery filled with elements of tension, thrills, isolation and fear in which the close quarters and harsh environment establish that there is nowhere to run and yet the setting is such that there are plenty of places the killer could be hiding.    U.S. Marshal Carrie Stetko (Kate Beckinsale) is the lone law enforcement officer present at a remote international science station based in Antarctica.  Surprisingly large and occupied by several hundred staff and researchers, a dead body is discovered in a desolate ice field many miles from the station under bizarre circumstances.  The station is getting ready to shut down early for the winter due to the impending arrival of a huge storm that will soon blanket the area with blizzard like conditions.  Racing against the clock, Carrie finds herself the center of a deepening mystery that involves the murder of another researcher, a ruthless but unknown killer who could be anyone and an abandoned 1957 Soviet cargo plane frozen under the ice in which more dead bodies are discovered.

B0012CQXLU|4.0|Black Mountain is a modern psychedelic rock band that pulls the masterful feat of sounding like classic rock without also sounding like they're blatantly ripping off their influences. With their second release, In the Future, they lay a heavy groove and tip their hats to Zeppelin and Sabbath (\\"Stormy High\\" and \\"Tyrants\\"), Pink Floyd (\\"Stay Free\\"), and even Jefferson Airplane (\\"Queens Will Play\\"). The band experiments on both this album and their self-titled debut by integrating horns, vocal layering, and plenty of audio effects but they also lay down enough sinister organ, driving guitars, and spacey atmospherics to make you feel like you're playing vinyl. Check out In the Future and ask yourself, what year is this again?
0553805371|4.0|I read the entire book very thoroughly over course of several days to make sure I grasped what Hawking was explaining and arguing for.  I have concluded that while Hawking is a master of astronomy and theoretical physics, he is so incredibly wrong on \\"philosophy being dead\\".  \\"The Grand Design\\" itself is a philosophy book with science to support it.  In regard to cultural religion and a God that \\"intervenes\\" and violates His own laws, Hawking is dead on.  But in regard to the origin of everything he uses very careful wording to argue against the need for God in the act of creation.  Hawking cannot disprove the existence of God anymore than he can use superficial \\"arguments\\" for the purpose of such.  Almost every time he takes a shot at God he does so in the context that people have historically used God for their benefit or because they thought they were at the center of the universe with God as their pray-worthy genie in the sky.  I admit he accurately portrays the typical religious person's limited perspective on the universe but he hardly knows how to dismount any elaborate or coherent arguments for theology and the existence of God.      Overall, it is a very good book.  But it could be immensely better.  I grant thee, Stephen Hawking, 3 and a half stars.
0439023513|3.0|First of all, I want to start with how much of a huge fan of the Hunger Games trilogy I was.  While I thought the second book was somewhat of an unnecessarily long bridge to gap the first book to the third book, I still found the second book rather enjoyable and read it faster than I read The Hunger Games.  However, I was disappointed to find that what charming attributes that made the first two books were disappointingly lacking in this final book.  Don't get me wrong, I thought Mockingjay was a great read, but it took a turn that I thought digressed way too much from the first two books.              ***SPOILERS AHEAD******SPOILERS AHEAD******SPOILERS AHEAD******SPOILERS AHEAD******SPOILERS AHEAD******SPOILERS AHEAD***              My first real issue with Mockingjay was the regression of Katniss's character.  I understand that characters, especially 'heroes' like Katniss Everdeen are supposed to rise and fall in their character developments, eventually finding their way to their own voice where they can make their own decisions and learn from their mistakes.  Unfortunately, as I completed Mockingjay, I found this not to be the case.  In The Hunger Games, Katniss is more relatable to audiences.  It's clear that she is distrustful of those around her, as she is put into a position where she must fend for her own in order to win the games.  However, she eventually learns to trust those around her, starting with Rue, and then eventually learning to trust (and manipulate) Peeta.  After the first two books, I had hoped that Katniss would eventually learn to value the people around her and learn to trust those who are willing to die for her.  But that is not at all the case.  Katniss stays as the reclusive, distrustful, and manipulative tribute from the first book.  In fact, she becomes so unlikeable that I found myself wishing that by the end of the book something horrific would happen to Katniss and she would die die DIE just so I wouldn't have to hear her whine whinewhine about how horrible her life is (at this point I'd like to point out that her family, aside from Gale's were pretty much the only one who got out SAFELY from District 12 after it got bombed.  yes, Katniss, your life is SOOOOO horrible that you were rescued from the Games with your family in tact, and all you can bitch about is how horrible your life is without your dead father.  Let's all keep in mind that you're not the one being tortured and being forced to watch everyone else you know die before your very eyes.).    Putting my rant for Katniss aside, I felt that Suzanne Collins failed to develop Katniss's character completely.  Katniss remains selfish and really only thinks about herself and her troubles before thinking about others.  As many other reviewers before me have pointed out, she only comes to Peeta's aid like 3 times out of the countless times she considers killing him.  Where is the compassion that she seems to spew in her mind but never seems to show to others.  From what I've noticed, Katniss only really ever mourns when people she loves are taken away from her.  Whenever she's with Gale or with Peeta, or even her mother and sister, she seems to take them for granted when they are present.  I suppose Collin's attempt to force Katniss into this realization was to kill her sister.  But even then Katniss does not seem to learn from her mistake, but is rather hellbent on spilling more blood in order to reach some kind of satisfaction for her sister's death.  Although I wasn't exactly opposed to the ending, since I will admit I enjoyed it (nothing wrong with a fairy tale ending), I was a bit disturbed thinking I would've actually preferred Katniss remain alone and empty after regressing from a passive Mockingjay to a soulless mutt.    But I digress (I could say so much more, but I'll spare the boring rants).  I want to move on to my next point, which is Suzanne Collins's sudden change in narrative.  I was so disappointed having to pretty much skimthrough so many parts in the book as I found much of the action scenes and the Call of Duty-esque battles seem to drag on and on in the book.  After awhile I found no sense of suspense after realizing that no major characters would really be killed off as all the other uncountable, insignificant characters like Leeg 1 and Leeg 2 (brilliant, no?) were offed in deaths that had to just one up the next one.  After managing to get through all of that, I felt cheated when Collins decided to not even show us anything at the end.  She built everything up about Snow's death, only to have her pretty much tell her everything that happens after Prim's death.  We don't see what happens to Snow.  We're told he may have been trampled.  We don't see the transfer of power from Capitol, District 13, and then to the 'people'.  We're told about that as well.  In fact, I feel like Collins' pretty much gave up describing it out to us and pretty much had to spell everything out to us, as if our brains to turned to mush just like Katniss' and Peeta's.  Instead of allowing us to interpret things for ourselves and figuring things through character actions, we get chunks of paragraphs of Katniss telling us what things mean (like the Hanging Tree poem that had to be so thoroughly broken down for us there was pretty much nothing left to the imagination) and what important things have transpired.  I felt like this was a huge cop out on the author's part.  Having taken part in Katniss' journey from the first book to the third, only to have the climatic and most crucial scenes be told to us in a brief paragraph, I was utterly disappointed and wished that I had just read the first book of this trilogy and then left everything else an open ended question.    On to the POSITIVE STUFF!!!  As much as I have so much stuff to rant about, I'm going to end with the very brief and tacked on ending.  Although as much as I despised Katniss by the end of the book, I felt that she eventually learns from her mistakes and develops her character...slightly.  After all, she finally acknowledges Peeta and opens her heart to him and even grows to have a family.  However, as previously mentioned we are never really shown this, but rather told.  Even so, I can't help but think back to Gale's assessment of Katniss choosing whoever she can't survive without.  She eventually accepts Peeta only because she learns that Gale is perhaps way too much like her, and the only way she can salvage her empty character is to fill it with the only positive element left in her life.  So maybe she doesn't grow as much as I would have liked, but perhaps this is a step to progression to show that over time Katniss is able to transform from mutt to subhuman.
0439023513|5.0|To start I am a 47 year old Veteran.  I have read a lot of the bad reviews for this last book and I see a theme running through them all. They didn't get their fairytale ending and the people they liked didn't end up the way they wanted. Well If you are looking for a fairytale read Harry Potter. If you want a realistic book on how war really is and how people will sacrifice themselves to save their country, then this is for you.  The love triangle between the three main characters resolves itself in the best way that I could see possible. The way each one would react to the horrors of war were obvious from book one. I don't want to include spoilers so Ill just say, read this with an expectation of a realistic portrayal of  the characters and how the war would change them. The ending on a personal level, is not necessarily a happy one, but it is a realistic one. From a \\"Big Picture\\" perspective I think it was a happy ending. To expect that all of the main characters could live \\"Happily Ever After\\" after surviving what happened in all three books is unrealistic.

B002BEJ3BK|5.0|After two rather dark and political oriented albums (2006's \\"Game Theory\\" and 2008's \\"Rising Down\\"), The Roots are back to basics with their new album \\"How I Got Over\\". While there have been countless personnel changes throughout their career, one thing that hasn't changed is their approach to making music. Musically, they've been into throwing curveballs and this album is no exception. The surprise guests that appear on \\"How I Got Over\\" come from the world of indie rock. Dirty Projectors members Amber Coffman, Angel Deradoorian, and Haley Dekle appear on the harmony-laden opening track \\"A Peace Of Light\\". Jim James of My Morning Jacket and Monsters Of Folk lends his vocals to \\"Dear God 2.0\\" a reworking of the song originally recorded by Monsters Of Folk. Lastly, Joanna Newsom checks in for the ultra-funky \\"Right On\\". Phonte of the now-defunct Little Brother stops by for two songs- \\"Now Or Never\\" and the album's best song \\"The Day\\" featuring angelic vocals from Patty Crash. On the title track \\"How I Got Over\\", Black Thought tries his hand at singing...and he's pretty good at it. The brief interlude \\"DillaTUDE: The Flight Of Titus\\" pays tribute to the deaths of the late J. Dilla and Baatin, the founding members of Slum Village. This album, like their last two, is pretty short for a Roots album, but as the old saying goes \\"Less Is More\\". In short, \\"How I Got Over\\" is the best hip hop album of 2010.

B001MYIXAC|5.0|it's no wonder why this movie made not much sense when I first saw it on DVD, because Magnolia botched the subtitles when they first came out with the DVDs (as the first reviews mentioned ) but it's now safe to say that Amazon is now selling the GOOD version. I just got a  good copy  with THEATRICAL English subtitles (make sure it says that on the back ) and I totally understand it now and I love it!  I cannot imagine the confusion this has brought on and how many would-have fans this great movie might have lost.

In short, it's a great addition to my video library and I hope to watch it many times.<br /><br />The extras on the DVD and Blu-ray are hardly worth the name, however, and if I had known they were so shabby--in length and quality--I would have saved five bucks and just gotten the \\"no extras\\" version.

B002ZCDR88|1.0|My ranking is not about Natalie Merchant's music per se, but about the physical product I received.    This is the third time that I have purchased \\"hard\\" (disc) media content and been disappointed with the product that Amzn sends me.  Not the content, necessarily.  Although, the one time ... well, here's the problem:  Amzn seems to sell (me) a lot of defective \\"hard\\" (disc) media content.      First time, I ordered an Afrocelt CD.  The package was labeled Afrocelt, the disc was labeled Afrocelt, but the music that came off the disc was 1940s vintage holiday (christmas) music.  Nobody in returns believed me.  Nobody at the manufacturer believed me.  I understand production problems (at the time, another music group had defective CD production occuring), but Amzn does not seem to understand.  I returned the Afrocelt CD, they kept a prorated return-shipping because they did not process the return as \\"defective\\".      Second time, I ordered Slumdog Millionaire.  Of course, Amzon is selling the bad versions of the DVD, in which the manufacturer has \\"mistakenly\\" packaged the rental version of the DVD (without special features) in the packaging for the special features purchase edition.  This time, they could not run from the \\"defect\\" since it was all over the media.      Third time, this time with Natalie Merchant, I ordered the 2-CD set.  Paid for the 2-CD set.  ***I only got one CD in my 2-CD set***.  Returns is going to ask me to prove a negative, that I did not receive my 2d CD.  Great.  Try that one on for size.      I'm not even counting all the times I've received scratched discs (because the jewel case is so abused that it comes cracked (miraculously the shipping box is not damaged) and the disc has broken loose.  Or Scratched even while still on the jewel box (or DVD) spindles, and well, digital corrupts absolutely.      I'm done buying anything but books from Amzn.  I am no way a huge purchaser of CDs or DVDs, so the fact that I keep getting physically defective merchandise makes me wonder whether the product being sold is bona fide, or something else.  I'll go to a store where I can open the merchandise in front of the cashier to verify the number of discs and the condition of the discs.  [Whether they will play the right content is a later problem.]
B001LF3YQK|1.0|I'll make this review to-the-point. Reasons to NOT waste your money on this:    1. It is exremely big and bulky, bigger than the actual wipes from the package. It literally takes up 30% of my diaper bag.  2. The red button pops off if you use to much pressure  3. The wipes dry out very quickly    I use the travel wipes from Target - cost less than a dollar, more in the package, no need to transfer, more compact and they stay moist!

0307341550|3.0|I started enjoying Gillian Flynn with her second book, 'Dark Places,' and was absolutely riveted by it.  Subsequently I decided to grab her debuting novel, 'Sharp Objects.'  Her amateur status rings out a bit in this book, unfortunately.  To me, this book is an example of art where the actual content is an unenjoyable experience.  Regardless of the fact that it was probably the author's intention to describe the novel's primary setting as a dreamy, dreary and disgusting visceral experience, it turned too much of the reading process into something akin to recalling snippets of an abstract nightmare.  Gillian Flynn is extremely skilled at instilling you with a creaking sense of unease, but it simply encompassed too much of the book.  Rarely did I experience relief from this to feel anything other than dread or it's relatives.    I also found many of the characters in the town to exhibit contrived, stereotypic behavior.  In my experience, when you first meet someone, rarely do they instantly drift off into pseudo-poetic riffs and wax abstract about the nature of day-dreaming.  On this same thread, I frequently felt that the plot was repeatedly stalled again and again while the narrator's exposition constantly indulged in long arbitrary streams of consciousness.  Again, masterful in actual execution, but implemented far too often in the macro sense.    Still, I made it through the book, as it is without doubt worth reading.  My opinion was perhaps skewed by how damned excellent her second book is!  All of these issues seem magically corrected in Dark Places, as it constantly juggles an awesome blend of haunting recollection/ musing with an ever-exciting plot that keeps up a brisk pace.  Can't wait for more from Flynn!
B003O85W3A|5.0|I don't think there's a lot to say when you can listen to clips.  You have walls of sound, soaring melodies, lyrics that range from poetic to tongue-in-cheek humourous.  If you like the current wave of newer bands that have an '80s sensibility, you have to have THE SUBURBS by Arcade Fire in your collection.
0439023513|2.0|\\"Mockingjay' is the final book in the Hunger Games trilogy.  If you haven't read the first two books, BEWARE:  SPOILER ALERT!  Katniss Everdeen, survivor of TWO Hunger Games, is back and deeply involved with the rebel alliance (very 'Star Wars', but it works) in District 13.  She's broken, mentally unstable, and depressive.  The Capitol and President Snow are VERY UPSET about her arrow-shot at the end of Book 2.  In fact, they're so angry, they've bombed the bejeebers out of Katniss' home district, District 12.  Most of the residents are dead and the few survivors are holed up in District 13 and being eyed closely as breeding stock.  This is the start of the story arc, and I'll tell you-- it goes downhill from here.  Katniss is having a breakdown and page after page of the book focuses on her depressive moods and thoughts.  It doesn't really move the storyline forward very much, just makes the reader think: \\"Yeesh! Enough already! I get it!\\".  Peeta is being held and tortured in The Capitol, and this adds a dimension of guilt to Katniss' already morbid mental state.  Eventually, he's rescued, but he's pretty much insane because of the combination drugs and torture suffered in The Capitol.  He tries to kill Katniss, and the sight of her puts him into a killing rage.  *sigh*  More angst for Katniss.  She decides to take up the mantle of 'Mockingjay' and be the figurehead for the Rebels.  Of course, she's being used by the president of District 13, but she doesn't seem to care very much at all.  2/3 of the book is Katniss being mopy, making propaganda films for District 13 to broadcast, and getting injured in gruesome ways with Gale at her side.  When at last the Rebels make their move on the Capitol, Katniss (with Gale by her side) is supposed to be on the fringe, but she ends up in the thick of the fight, being shot, stabbed, burned and everything else you can think of.  The book just ENDS, in an abrupt way that jumps around in time and location.  There's an Afterward that seemed more like an afterthought.  Very unsatisfactory.  I'm not sure what I was looking for.  Maybe more peace for Katniss and the surviving humans?  Overall, a brutal, lengthy book that could have benefitted by some tough-love editing.  Of course, if you've read the first two, you have to read the last one, so Collins has everyone hooked.  Clever girl. One of my main issues with this series for Teens is that it has overtones of 'Lord of the Flies' as well as the Japanese book 'Battle Royale' by Takami.  Collins goes overboard in the detailed cruelty that Katniss faces and witnesses.  Would this level of torturing be approprate for an adult book?  Yes.  I think it is too detailed for Tweens for sure.  I would have to tell Teens that they need strong stomachs for book 3.  The laundry list of graphic horrors is pretty long, and I wouldn't suggest this for Tweens at all.  I enjoyed the first book the most, the 2nd book a little less, and the final one not at all.  I just felt that I had to finish it to get closure, but I was mentally beaten up when I turned the last page.
B000000ITN|5.0|While not the same band from their first four albums, this band, with the help of Dickey Betts \\"pickin on that red guitar\\" established the template for all southern rock bands to follow. Every song a winner: Wasted Words a nod to their past; Ramblin Man a nod to their future; Come and Go Blues another nod to the past; Jelly Jelly probably the best, most economical blues solo on record, the fire inside; Southbound, Jessica and Pony Boy just indescribably delicious.  If you do not have this album, shame on you.

0385736002|4.0|**NOT A SPOILER**  More Amazon reviewers should learn the difference between a book review and a summary, spoiling the entire story for potential readers.    This book was a fun read. It cleverly mingles historical fact with fiction and I found myself frequently checking Wikipedia to research how much in this book was actually truth. In this way it reminded me of [[ASIN:0307474275 The Da Vinci Code]]. However, Michael Scott brings this concept closer to a younger reading group by using more fantasy elements and bringing the story much further from a plausible alternative reality. This is exactly the sort of thing that, as a fantasy fan, I was hoping for as I was reading.    I am nearly 25 years old, however, and found the author's blatant outreach to young teen readers a bit hard to relate to. Michael Scott does not try to hide the clear attachment he tries to make between the reader and the 15 year old Protagonist. He wants the reader to identify with these pubescent characters.     The book is definitely fit for teen fantasy fans in the wake of Harry Potter, and if older reader can get over the incessant appeal it makes to high schoolers and their video games, insecurities, and poor driving skills, they will find a fun adventure for themselves as well.

B001F7XIJW|5.0|If there is one thing missing from a lot of metal today, be it black, death or whatever, it's originality and variety.  To be fair, metal is one of rock's most intolerant forms, with fans usually very opposed to new directions once their favorite band has defined itself.  To get around that, the smart metal bands introduce a wide palate to start out with.  Gojira is truly one of the most unique metal outfits out there right now.<br />  \\"The Way Of All Flesh\\" harkens back to the '70's era, not sonically, but embracing the variety seminal bands like Blue Oyster Cult and the mellower moments of Black Sabbath (\\"Fluff\\" and \\"Laguna Sunrise\\").  Recognizing that while a record can certainly be great as it pounds you over and over, ala Slayer, bands that allow breathing space create records that have more dimension and depth to them.  Gojira definitely falls into this category.  There are no lead breaks so to speak, and Joe Duplantier's vocals go from a death growl to stadium style shouting.  The songs are long, but all stand on their own as great individual tracks, none sounding quite like the other.<br />  The guitars are ridiculously heavy but very hook laden.  \\"The Way Of All Flesh\\" needs to be heard to be believed, as comparisons to anything but Gojira's previous work are almost impossible.  That's a very good thing.

B002VPE1AW|3.0|...when I saw in the news how popular this movie is.  Recall the scene in Ferris Bueller's Day Off where the maître d' looks at Ferris and his friends, shakes his head, and says \\"I weep for the future;\\" that's how I feel when I think that this is what passes for excellence in film-making now.  It's not that there isn't anything likable about this movie, the visuals are stunning.  But the dialog is incredibly corny and the plot is unoriginal ('Dances with Toruk' is a more honest name for the movie).  A person who is being honest with themselves cannot look me in the face and say that this movie is a good movie.  For a movie to truly be good it cannot rely solely on special effects, no matter how great those effects are.
0066620996|5.0|I was not sure Collins' book would apply to church leadership; however, I found it helpful and insightful for issues related churches.  The findings that Collins' team extrapolate from their study are directly applicable to leading all organizations and not just businesses.  The values of humility, passion and perseverence among leaders of Good to GReat companies apply directly to all forms of leadership.  The other concepts are helpful to all leaders as well. I recommend this book for all leaders. I look forward to reading Collins' other books, too.

0765326353|5.0|I just started reading Sanderson's books a little over a year ago.  He is now one of my favorite authors, and The Way of Kings has made it to the top of the list.  It is not my favorite of his books, and is a competing place for my all time favorite book.    He does, as always, a wonderful job of describing places, creatures and developing his characters to the point that you love them, hate them, and simply get frustrated with them.  They become real.  While 1000 pages may seem a lot to read, it really felt like reading something much short, thats how well written it is.  I got to the end and wondered where all the pages went.      Read the summary on the back, its exellent for that type of thing and I fear I'll give something away if I try to explain it.  Suffice to say, its one amazing book and you should pick it up and read it.

B000SEFEHW|5.0|First of all, this review refers to the Kindle version--unfortunately,  some of the tables are seriously messed up on the version and so I would buy the paper copy next time! As a coach,  I recommended this book to a client starting a new job in a non-profit.  It is an excellent resource and forces people to think about what they are facing in their new position.  Can be an excellent homework assignment from a coach and a good starting point for coaching conversations.

B003L77TZI|1.0|Ive enjoyed all chart topping Katy Perry songs, certainly California Gurls and Teenage Dream no exception.  However, the rest is garbage- stick with the singles.  Do not buy this for children, the lyrics are immature and brainless... I recommend searching web and reading lyrics for \\"Peacock\\" before making purchase- will give you idea of rest of album.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|This series is absolutely amazing, with the best photography I have ever seen of the landscape, the flora and the fauna of our incredible planet.  Watch it on Blu-Ray if you can, the images are crystal clear and the subject matter is absorbing.  Planet Earth will definitely give you a new appreciaton of the beautiful world in which we live.  A must for family viewing.
0439023513|4.0|A fine wrap-up to the series, its so nice to have a author who can get it all said in 3 books. I got misty-eyed a couple of times(but I cry every time old yeller gets shot). The end of the book is a little abrupt,but not out of line. Well worth the read.

0765326353|1.0|Finished reading this book, unbelievable how over hyped this novel is, the story comes to a grinding halt after page 47 and doesn't pickup until about 743 pages later. Will tax even the most experienced readers. For such a huge book, it felt shallow and barely provided characters and situations that a reader could immerse themselves into and connect with. Over extended scenes(Kaladin and Bridge Crew 4) that went nowhere, each character is stuck in a set piece for hundreds of pages with barely anything relevant happening that pushes the story forward until the very end of book(alround the last 200 pages). The ending is definitely not worth the time investment.
B001BTG3OQ|5.0|People talk too much about the over heating/ auto-shut off feature. Just turn the heat sensor off and forget about it! I tried to find an sb-800 first, but since they don't make them anymore, they're now more expensive than the sb-900 brand new. If you want quicker recycle time, get a battery pack. For what I use, general shooting, weddings and events, regular batteries work just fine. Pair it with a Fong and you'll be in business.

B002ZG98UA|3.0|I loved the scenery, special effects and the fight scenes but the acting was abysmal. Everyone including Milla Jovovich, delivered their lines like they were reading the instructions off the back of a pregnancy test box. Some parts were unintentionally hilarious and ridiculous as well. Another thing that killed me was that they tried to inject characters from the video game(Chris & Claire Redfield) as if they are trying to be true to the source material. You already hacked up the original plot of the video game so why try to redeem yourselves with this mediocre mess now. All in all, it was decent enough to sit through but not as EPIC as it wants you to believe. If you just have to watch this, go at the matin&eacute;e price or try like hell to get some free passes. 2.5 stars for me but would have been 3 if the acting wasn't so horrid.

6304711875|5.0|****WARNING POSSIBLE SPOILERS!!!***    I love this movie. It's a kind of funny/horror mix of a movie. Everyone is perfectly cast-Neve Campbell of course (who I also loved in \\"The Craft\\") and Skeet Ulrich in particular is especially GORGEOUS/SEXY/SCARY. I was shocked to find out several years later that he has quite a range-check out his extraordinary performance in the Hallmark movie \\"The Magic of Ordinary Days\\". Quite an understated talent. He's terrific in the \\"Jericho\\" series as well!    Highly recommend this awesome horror classic with a twist! :)
B0015DROBO|1.0|I first saw this book when a seat-mate on an airline was reading it. What a strange title, I thought, for an adult man to be reading a book about a girl with a dragon tattoo. I thought it was a book for teenage girls. Then I heard from friends that it was a great read and I must but all three books.<br />So I downloaded a sample onto my Kindle - luckily, as it turns out, for free.<br />The first page did not catch me. Bad sign, but I kept reading. My good friends assured me that it was a great book. I kept reading. And hoping.<br />Finally a plot came to view - but most of what I read was the authors voice. Not much character development or interest. It's just plain boring. And very poor dialog - what there was of it. Good novels should have escalating conflict. The early main character of this book is about to go to jail and be fined a huge sum of money (altho I don't know how much a Kronor is worth is US dollars) and he doesn't seem worried. \\"I'm going to jail and losing most of my money -oh well\\" is his attitude.<br />Anyway, I kept reading, hopeful that my friends were right.<br />Soon I found myself skimming the book, hoping to reach the end of the chapter. Hopeful that something would happen in the next.<br />I have not yet reached the end of the sample and won't. My next action is DELETE.

1594202559|4.0|If you are a frequent reader of Wall Street texts, a sizeable amount of the material in More Money Than God will be redundant. The author discusses famous managers such as Alfred Winslow Jones, Julian Robertson, Paul Tudor Jones, George Soros, John Paulson, Ken Griffin, Stan Druckenmiller and Jim Simons. These managers and their notable trades are covered in much greater detail in books such as The Greatest Trade Ever, Hedge Hogging, Market Wizards and When Genius Failed.  Yet, it is nice to read a book that defends the rationale of hedge funds while detailing their evolutionary path. For these reasons, I would recommend the book even if you are scholar of the hedge fund industry.<br /><br />Unlike some of the more popular books on the subject of hedge funds, More Money Than God covers the history of the industry dating back to the late 1940s. It includes an interesting look at the life and work Alfred Winslow Jones, who is arguably the father of modern hedge funds. The author goes on to describe how great managers and their funds have spawned other great funds started by former employees, strongly suggesting that this chain of success supports that idea investing prowess is indeed NOT random.<br /><br />The dark side of industry is also discussed as major failures are recounted along with some questionable activities by other funds. While not quite a riveting as a book like When Genius Failed, the books covers blowups such the collapse of Amaranth and the involvement of Citadel in the rescue.  This is the first book that I have seen that gets into any detail about Citadel, which was a nice plus.<br /><br />In era of Wall Street bashing, Sebastian Mallaby gives a refreshingly balanced view of the industry.  Specifically he explains the following: 1) the government has not bailed out hedge funds during any financial crisis 2) hedge funds did NOT cause the mortgage crisis 3) hedge funds have outperformed the market (one caveat - possibly incomplete data) 4) the performance fee structure and managers' personal wealth invested in funds align their interests with investors.  On #4, the author does acknowledge that hedge funds do have a problem that the fund can be just be shut down by managers after a bad year, allowing them to slink away without any recourse by investors to claw back managers' earnings.<br /><br />In total, the book is both educational and entertaining.  At the same time, it is a casual read that could be completed on a long flight. It is a great addition to any Wall Street history book collection.nd managers' personal wealth invested in funds align their interests with investors.

B002VECM6S|1.0|Typical shallow Hollywood \\"You Can Do It!\\" fare you've seen a zillion times.  Like I'm so sure the guy had no idea how to play football until the mom comes along and gives him a pep talk.<br /><br />Sandra Bullock is her usual awful self.  Evidently America prefers her in her with-it-lady-yelling-at-someone mode.<br /><br />The performance by the lead, Quinton Aaron, was also a major disappointment.  At first he gives this off-center, muted performance, as if he's barely containing some volcanic rage.  And you start thinking, \\"This is gonna be great!  This guy's gonna explode!\\"  But instead that never happens.  What instead happens is that you get this off-putting, unfocused performance all the way up till the end of the movie.  This may in fact be how some people are in real life but it sure doesn't come off that well on the screen.<br /><br />Also, hasn't this all been done before?  How about (without thinking about it too much) a 1999 film called \\"The Hurricane,\\" with Denzel Washington . . . right down to the \\"Why are you doing all this for me?\\" scene!

I have to give some props to Amazon.com for such a heady play, to make a album like this available a such a price. To me this is hip hop at its best. Janelle who unique look and ability to dance up a storm on demand is what first got my attention, this lady has some real musical skills as demonstrated on this album. I can hardly wait for her next album  to drop. If you like good music this is a good addition to your collection. Peace
1416550550|5.0|I love this book and was sad to finish it because the characters were so vivid and fascinating. Couldn't put this book down as soon as I started.

0060392886|3.0|Big book but an easy and quick read.    This book does lack lots of details of their escapades.  They really just state the escapade and move on.  I am not sure if this stuff really happened or were they just too smashed to remember what happened.    I did not feel like I was there like other readers express but I still admire the Crue's reflections on their upbringing and how they feel about themselves.  Any reader can tell that due to their childhood that they lack alot of maturity or ability to handle all their fame and people they meet.     Nonetheless, this book is great and I enjoy picking up the book and reading about their adventures with the drugs and the girls.

B000244FDW|1.0|I couldn't even watch this all the way through.  I tried.  I really tried.  But it is HORRIBLE.  HORRIBLE!    The acting is bad.  The writing is bad - even the authentic Jane Austen dialogue comes across poorly here!  None of the characters come across they way Austen described them in the book.  (I don't understand the reviews calling this the most authentic version; I strongly disagree!)    and don't even get me started on Mr. Darcy.  huh????  When I read reviews stating that this version was better than Colin Firth, I thought that I was in for a huge treat.  But this Darcy is DREADFUL.  I do not know what people who like this version were watching.  I love period pieces, especially Jane Austen and MOST especially P&P.  But I cannot even finish this.  Blech.

B001PPLIEG|2.0|The problem with QoS is that the villain is about as threatening as a Care Bear, and rather than getting his hands on nuclear missiles, he's attempting to corner 60% of the Bolivian water market. This would be weak enough if it affected somewhere in the US, but Bolivia? In an issue that would barely raise an eyebrow at the UN, Britain obviously decides to send its number one spy to fix the problem.<br /><br />In between a chain of over-the-top action sequences there's an InstantMix plot of no consequence. The plot points are TV-grade: in one 'pivotal' scene, Bond overhears the villain's master plans while hiding behind a fence. This is as much for the audience's benefit as for Bond's, in case we missed the over-signaled evil plan while being confused about the movie's title. Out-Bonded by True Lies and mercilessly parodied in Austin Powers, I think Bond's time may be over. It's really a shame since Casino Royale wasn't a good reboot of the franchise.

B00000JSJC|5.0|Kathryn Bigalow is fun to watch - I'm glad she defined her own voice more distinctly in The Hurt Locker, but Strange Days is a great example of what James Cameron's style looks like when it's combined with someone else. It's got Cameron written all over it: a strong female lead, inventive action sequences, the threat of technology, the redemptive power of love - everything except his increasingly first-draft dialog, actually.<br /><br />The story is set in the future (2000) where memories are recorded and shared illegally - people are hooked on experiencing each other's lives, with some of the less kosher experiences being traded like drugs. The film opens with a 5-6 minute point-of-view sequence (cleverly designed to look like one shot) of a robbery than ends in the death of the person recording the experience, so it provides the thrill of the hold-up with an element of snuff. It's a highly effective way to introduce the topic. The story revolves around a rape/murder that is captured as a clip, and trying to identify the killer amidst an environment of corrupt cop, a Los Angeles torn apart by riots and racism, and our hero (Ralph Fiennes) trying to move on with his life and quit his addiction to clips.<br /><br />I lived in the UK when I saw this in 1995 and what prevented the movie from being a blockbuster hit was the rape sequence. It's actually essential to the telling of the story but wow did audiences run away in droves. By today's standards, where we have Robocop airing on cable at 9am, it's not *that* shocking which is more of a reflection of our desensitization than anything else. But nevertheless it derailed the movie back then and I remember people walking out of the theater at the time.<br /><br />In the history of film, it will stand as a great example - maybe the only example - of James Cameron collaborating fully with someone else. It's clearly a production of two people and is much stronger than if either had created it individually. The subplots are more complicated than some of Cameron's other films and the cinematography and action are better than many of Bigelow's movies. There are some great performances from Angela Bassett and Ralph Fiennes - and Tom Sizemore, Vincent d'Onofrio and Michael Wincott are good value as ever.more complicated than some of Cameron's other films and the cinematography and action are better than many of Bigelow's movies.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Wow, talk about a gripping storyline.    I'll admit I'm a sucker for post apocalyptic, end of the world fiction. This is a whole new idea to me though, brilliantly thought out and wonderfully written.    I know when a book really has me because I can spend hours reading without stopping and The Hunger Games definitely had me. When you catch yourself waiting for the chance to pick up your book (kindle) again so you can find out what happens next, then the author has really done their job.    Katniss is a brilliantly written character with just enough complexity to keep you guessing without being overly confusing just for the sake of it.  I think Peeta could have been developed as a character a little more but then maybe that's what awaits me in book #2.    I haven't read Battle Royale that people claim this copies from but really how similar could they be? There are so many intricacies to \\"The Games\\" that surely they are different and maybe it's just the basic premise seems familiar. I'll have to reserve judgment until I have read it I suppose.    I'm looking forward to reading the rest of this series, The Hunger Games was a great start to a trilogy.
B002UZCJ8Y|3.0|Jonathan Mostow has the ability to emotionally and structurally sabotage any script, no matter how good the concept. JM chopped the Terminator franchise off at the knees with T3 to the point where even the Terminator 90210 TV show ignored the film completely. Now he's been presented with yet another high-concept premise and has a Michael Bay-like drive to totally mess it up in a way so vicious that a sequel is as unlikely as someone not mistaking Bruce Willis' toupe for a Zhu Zhu hamster. Mostow should be banned from going near any other scripts or ideas - he's the sort of guy who could film The Bible and cause an exodus from the religion.<br /><br />That being said, the concept is strong here - people controlling robots to represent themselves in the real world in an Avatar kind-of-way, and there are some interesting flaws and side-effects that could have been the foundation of a really excellent sci-fi franchise. Instead we're presented with mindless and pointless action sequences that rob the audience of the promised emotional engagement. And much like T3, even the expensive CGI and visuals lack impact - though they effectively sell the Surrogates concept. At some point this script will be remade into an excellent version 2.0 - hold out for that one. In the meantime, lobby Congress to get Mostow handcuffed  - if he ever gets to work with Ben Affleck, it could spell the end of the entire film industry

B002UJIY7A|2.0|We almost didn't rent this since it sounded like it could be a slasher pic along the lines of Touristas, which ranks in the top 2 hours of sick voyeuristic snuff I've ever seen. But this has some stars attached, and I'm fairly shallow in that way. The plot: \\"Two couples are trekking in a remote island location where psychos are stalking and brutally murdering couples.\\"<br /><br />As Eddie Izzard once observed about B-movie characters, \\"Don't they listen to the music?\\". Don't they wonder why it's called the Forest of Death and Blood? Pretty much all the character have had their common sense glands removed, and do something incredibly stupid in almost every scene. Even after the 'reserved screenwriter hero' stops to pick up psycho hitchhikers - a \\"wow, my IQ just dropped\\" moment - then everyone is armed to the teeth with knives, axes and stabby things - and nobody thinks this is very weird. Or alarming. Like I would.<br /><br />The most irritating flaw in the film is the post-modern self-aware screenplay discussion that goes on, Tarantino-esque, but in a way that the average audience member doesn't care about or understand. If music had verses explaining the structure, it would be strange enough, but for a film to talk about its own Act 2 twist, Act 3 reversal and bad guy cliches is grating and unnecessary. That said, it does signal the supposedly \\"big twist\\" that happens at the beginning of Act 3. The big twist is about as improbable as you can imagine and leaves a whole pile of threads undone.<br /><br />The final 30 minutes must have seen the arrival of LSD in the editing booth, since the style moves from scene-cut-scene-cut to cut-cut-overlay-cut-cut-overlay-cut-cut-cut. There are some pretty gory moments in between, and plenty of random one-page characters who get clean shots to the head (an accuracy that is mysteriously lost when the bad guy tries to shoot our heroes).<br /><br />Anyway, all-in-all it's a very good B-movie but shows the chasm between B and A that still exists. Even though I went to Hawaii on my honeymoon, I'm now recommending against it based upon the crazed killers that stalk the islands and the incompetent police who shoot people from helicopters. It was missing two vital B-movie ingredients, however - dumb-but-attractive teenagers trying to make out and find somewhere to do the bad thing, and then the subsequent gruesome deaths of said teenagers who are always punished in the Puritanical rules of B-movie slasher folklore.waii on my honeymoon, I'm now recommending against it based upon the crazed killers that stalk the islands and the incompetent police who shoot people from helicopters.

B001QOGYFO|1.0|I knew when the opening scene had Kate Beckinsdale getting into a shower that it was the only thing they could do to get the audience's attention. It's pretty much downhill from there, descending into a TV episode set in snow. Lacking the supernatural element of the almost-as-bad \\"The Last Winter\\" and trying to salvage the best bits from The Thing and that episode of the X Files set in Alaska, it's a mish-mash of ludicrous plot points and terrible dialog. The best part is when Kate gets two fingers amputated - I never thought I'd say that.<br /><br />Every twist is signaled from a mile off and there are so many \\"why did they do that?\\" moments that it robs the picture of any tension, suspense or surprise. Kate B sleepwalks her way through the role and Tom Skerritt is starting to look more like Kris Kristoffersen every day. The whiteout scenes suffer from unnecessary CGI injection, and fail to convey any sense of the beauty of the locale. Then there are endless technical flaws that will have you rolling in the aisles (the wind gives Kate B frostbite in 10 seconds flat but in every scene the character have no face mask and are unaffected).<br /><br />Warning - spoiler below:<br /><br />In the final scene, they use batteries from a potentially life-saving radio to escape - when they could have use the ones from a flashlight. Not very likely, methinks. And if you didn't get Skerritt as the bad guy from almost the first scene, you may have just been in the bathroom.

B000GUJZ4G|4.0|The greatest movie ever made! Seriously, yes. No, I'm kidding. But, no, seriously. If you disagree all I can say is \\"Back off Warchild, seriously.\\" Point Break was the the Starship Troopers of its era - which is another contender for best movie ever made - and brought together a disparate collection of unique treasures never to be assembled again, including:<br />- A performance by Keanu Reeves so memorable that he was subsequently cast as Don John in Brannagh's Much Ado About Nothing.<br />- The appearance of 'Craziest Person in the World' Gary Busey, who was voluntarily cast by Kathryn Bigelow whereas normally there's an agency clause or losing poker hand responsible for his appearance.<br />- John C McGinley playing John C McGinley, practicing for his role in Scrubs as John C McGinley.<br />- A range of such deliriously rich dialog that you can go through your entire life using only quotes from the movie and still manage to survive on the food Gary Busy orders.<br /><br />The plot is possibly the most implausible in the history of an industry famed for implausible plots. I've even seen Catwoman and nothing comes close to the concept of this: \\"Surfers rob banks to pay for surfing.\\" Hmmm, why? We don't know. How do we they're good? Because - and remember this if you ever decide to take more than the free candy at Wells Fargo - they don't go for the vault and they don't kill anybody. For some reason the FBI gets involved, and if you've ever been tempted by a career in law enforcement let me tell you the FBI pays for surfing lessons while you shack up with Lori Petti.<br /><br />Anyway, Keanu - a name that I've never come across in real life, though I've met plenty of Summers and Rainbows - infiltrates the surfer dude gang by acting like a surfer dude. Well, not really acting but you get it. There's a point that comes dangerously close to science where they figure out the chemical composition of something left behind at a scene and determine that it's used on surfboards and ergo that the robbers must be a gang of surfers. I used this logic to conclude that the previous owner of my car worked in McDonald's when I found a 2-year old French fry under the spare tire. Keanu eventually gets caught in his duplicity by leaving his wallet around and instead of hiding his badge somewhere behind his Safeway and Costco cards, it's sat there with big three letters \\"F-B-I\\".<br /><br />There's some inspiring political stuff about \\"fighting the system\\" and showing people \\"inching their way down the freeway in their metal coffins\\", and that it's all about the ride. The whole thing is like Venice Beach with a brain, but thankfully doesn't last very long before we're back to jumping out of airplanes. Swayze is excellent as always and I'm sure his spirit looks down on the nightly Point Break LIVE! in LA, where audience members are cast as Johnny Utah. I wish I had a state as a last name, as long as that state wasn't New Hampshire.<br /><br />The finale will have you clenched on the sofa, with your brain rocking back and forth in your skull trying to make it stop: Bells Beach (Australia) - where Swayze is going for a suicidal surf into the biggest wave in history. The Australian police have terrible accents but maybe that's just Bells Beach where they happen to sound like American actors who don't know the difference between English and Australian accents, 'mate'. Keep a box of tissues handy since Bodhi's not \\"paddling to New Zealand\\" (at least not from Malibu).<br /><br />In conclusion, \\"22 years. Man, L.A. has changed a lot during that time. The air got dirty and the sex got clean.\\" So true, Gary Busey. So true.st be a gang of surfers.

They have included pure Modern Metal tracks, like \\"God Hates Us\\" and \\"Welcome to the Family\\". And softer balads like \\"Victim\\". The last track \\"Save Me\\", is one of their best so far. Portnoy was the obvious choice to fill in for the Rev. His style fits perfectly, without him losing his signature touch. The album might be sad, yet I can only be happy for these guys. They managed to craft a worthy tribute to their fallen brother while finding both commercial and artistic success.
B00288KNL8|5.0|Never seen it before ...seen it in previews in another video...purchased for my 2 year old niece...good quality video but think she is too young to see it...she says it is scary...think its just the figures are not like what she sees in her other movies...
0312330537|4.0|In June, I started reading this &uuml;berlong book about Bombay at the recommendation of two bookworm friends. Several months and 933 pages later (having read a number of other books along the way), I've finally finished it. Shantaram is supposedly author Gregory David Roberts' semi-autobiographical story of approximately four years spent by a character nicknamed \\"Lin,\\" a 30-year-old New Zealander and Australian-prison-escapee living on the seedier side (primarily the streets and slums) of Bombay during the early 80s. The most amazing thing about the book is the number of nearly incomprehensible incidents in which Lin aka Shantaram gets involved, which include (beware of vague references that may be spoilerish) such things as: a really big bear hug; bystanders' actions against the at-fault in an accident; unconventional behavior towards organ donators; fire fortuitousness; cord catching during a death-defying deed; slumming it, doctor-style; escaping from Zhou-catraz; skin seam sewing; tot tutoring; cholera conquering; heroin habit (and kicking cold turkey); gun running; document doctoring; and much, much more.<br /><br />Shantaram, who seems to spend a lot of time inside his own head, spends a lot of time tossing out philosophical lines (which I like to call, \\"Linisms\\"), including: (p 90), \\"Optimism is the first cousin of love, and it's exactly like love in three ways: it's pushy, it has no real sense of humour, and it turns up where you least expect it,\\" (p 147) \\"Life on the run puts a lie in the echo of every laugh, and at least a little larceny in every act of love,\\" (p 230) \\"Poverty and pride are devoted blood brothers until one, always and inevitably, kills the other,\\" (p 398) \\"Fate's way of beating us in a fair fight is to give us warnings that we hear, but never heed,\\" (p 426) \\"Guilt is the hilt of the knife that we use on ourselves, and love is often the blade; but it's worry that keeps the knife share, and worry that gets most of us, in the end,\\" and (p 709) \\"Jealousy, like the flawed love that bears it, has no respect for time or space or wisely reasoned argument. Jealousy can raise the dead with a single, spiteful taunt, or hate a perfect stranger for nothing more than the sound of his name.\\"<br /><br />In spite of the over-the-top actions on the part of his alternately good guy/bad boy Bombayite, author Roberts can really tell a yarn (though I was not a fan of his man-flowery style descriptions), making Shantaram, in spite of its sometimes long-windedness, worth the read. Better: A Fine Balance by Rohinton Mistry, Interpreter of Maladies by Jhumpa Lahiri, and The Road by Cormac McCarthy.y, like the flawed love that bears it, has no respect for time or space or wisely reasoned argument.

B00005RDRO|5.0|Hysterical Movie. It is funniest if you are familiar with the old decective stories, but still very much enjoyable even if you are unfamiliar with all of the caricatures. All-star casting and excellent writing make this film a classic
B002ZG9846|5.0|\\"HG\\" actually reminds me of shaolin kids who had to go through training at a very young age. the fact that in this fantasy comic turned movie, that HG slices and dices her way to save the day and her daddy kicks it up a notch. i hv no prob. watching the little girl does her martial arts and kicks all those baddies' butts. yes, she has a potty mouth ... but she uses her bleep language selectively. the writers who did those lines did a good job, i say. and the young actress delivered those lines with finesse! love it! have ordered this blu-ray package. can't wait to watch it again in blu-ray. love the whole story line and plot!

But for some reason I thought this would be a fun book to read and boy howdy is it!  You can hear it being said by Ozzy as you read it is so in his voice.  I had to read parts outloud to share with my friends they were so funny.  I  loved this book...and mighty fond of this man now!  Guess what my ring tone is...Crazy Train!

B003UYUR10|4.0|This was a very entertaining movie. It has a lot action and has a lot of references to the games. I would buy the bluray, but I refuse to pay over 20.00 for a bunch of discs I don't need nor want. I will wait for a used copy either from blockbuster or Amazon marketplace. I don't see why they won't put out a single disc bluray for those of us who want just that. People need to stop buying these overpriced sets then maybe the studios will get the message.
B001TH8UUA|5.0|I could never understand how some HDMI cables cost so much when perfectly acceptable alternatives exist, like this AmazonBasics High-Speed HDMI cable. I have three of these cables and they all perform as good as could be expected. The only essential difference between this cable and those that cost $30, $40 or more is the price. This will get the job done at a fraction of the price. They are well made and have Amazon behind them. You can't go wrong.

0784011206|4.0|I always did like the Rambo series, but never really found the copies I needed in certain stores, and the library that checks out movies never has them, it seems, so when I became a client of Amazon,I thought, Why not? And I ordered the movie just recently.<br />The movie came just one hour ago, and I was very impressed with it's speedy service. And I have nothing against the movie or Stallone's way of acting, which was just right considering his big Rambo debut of 1982. But the condition of the DVD cover forces me to rate it 4 out of 5 stars. Of course, I bought it used for a good price, but one of the snaps which keeps the DVD cover closed is broken and half the plastic cover on the back had peeled off, not to mention the disc wasn't all the way on it's holder, which could've gotten it scratched up if the disc was handled in an improper way, but it wasn't. I just have to mention that it DID say on the order purchase, \\"Minor wear to case.\\" But this seems a lot more than minor to me. I'm not disgusted with it but I'm just relieved that no more damage had been done, and the movie is excellent!
B000001ESJ|5.0|What an album! Sometimes overlooked because of the classics like 2112 and Moving Pictures, but what a followup to one of the greatest rock epics ever.    I came to the Rush a little late, at 2112. I had that album and All the World's a Stage. When I slapped AFTK on the 'ol turntable, I was at first taken aback, but as I got through the first listen, I think that is when I REALLY became the Rush fan I am today    In retrospect, I think it was pretty easy to be a Rush fan after 2112. I was hooked, but AFTK blew me away, it became my favorite Rush album. The gentle classical guitar intro of the title track, panning from one side to the other, and then BLAM! Here we go!    \\"Xanadu\\" is incomparable. The chimes, bells, Neil's birds, the lyrics, what a mini-epic. What a way to end an album side.    Side 2 continues with \\"Cinderella Man\\", with some killer rippage by the best bassist in rock.    \\"Closer to the Heart\\" is the obvious \\"hit\\" from the album, and would find its way into their live sets for3 decades.    \\"Madrigal\\" is the gentle precursor to \\"Cygnus X-1\\". I love how it slowly fades and Cygnus quietly enters, eventually becoming a frantic spasm of jamming, to end with a \\"...to be continued\\" tease.    It is mixed with a bit of muteness to it, and the addition of the Taurus pedals and Mini Moog added a dimension that I loved, until it became too much in the forefront on later albums. As everyone asked themselves after this album, how do they play all those instruments?    I realize that when this was recorded, they had restraints on where a song could be placed on the album, yet I think that if someone planned the way it plays out, it was genius. I think that if they changed the track order around on a CD, it wouldn't be the same. The way the title song greets you, that this will be different than you've heard before, and how \\"Madrigal\\" eases into \\"Cygnus\\", which is the grand finale of this awesome gem.    Bravo, Rush and Terry Brown. A masterpiece followed by anothermasterpiece.

0385335989|5.0|I started reading the \\"Outlander\\" Series from the beginning and have been unable to put them down. Drums of Autumn was no acception. I was enralled in not only Claire and Jamie's romance, but now I have Brianna and Roger to follow and enjoy. The way the connections and love between the characters are written, makes Diana Gabladon's books intriguing and allows me to feel what they are feeling. I truly love these books and the characters. I would reccomend them to anyone. Start at the beginning and when you get to the end, start over again!
0553805371|3.0|This work is mostly an interesting explanation of many current major scientific theories, except for the unexpected omission of any significant explanation of what is meant by the \\"Grand Design\\" M-theory. I was hoping that the authors would deliver on the promise made in the title, jacket and first chapter, but they did not come close to it.     I was underwhelmed that the authors did not explain why quantum physicists apply the \\"chaos\\" and \\"unpredictability\\" found at the atomic level to the uni/multiverse. They explained that large objects work with one set of predictable, measurable Newtonian laws. Then they write about the discoveries of mysterious quantum things, which act very differently than big things. But then in talking about how the universe works (which is a pretty big thing) they seem to apply quantum rules to it and not Newtonian. They don't give a good explanation for that jump. It might be somewhere else, but it is not here.     Of course, the big conclusion is that God was not necessary for creation. But that sounds an awful lot like their premise on page 30 that \\"a complete set of laws...excludes the possibility of miracles or an active role for God.\\" If your conclusion is the same as one of your premises in a logical argument, that is not a very convincing logical argument. Sounds like: Premise #1, The moon is made of cheese. Premise #2, Things that are made of cheese are cheesy. Therefore, The cheesy moon is made of moon cheese. I know that one of the authors is said to be the \\"smartest man in the world,\\" but that is a pretty obvious error in logic. A premise just cannot be the same as what you are seeking to prove. If it is, then the conclusion has only the weight of of the assumed premise.    Lastly, even if this were a valid proof that God is not \\"necessary\\" for the creation of the uni/multiverse, that is not the same as a proof that God does not exist. This explanation of quantum theory does not reach all the way to an exclusion of the possibility of God's existence. This only shows that science does not prove the existence of God.     Is that new news? No, that is old news. Brand new book, big name authors, same old story.    After all that, I was left with a desire for more information about this subject, not because they answered my questions and that led me to more questions, but because they did not fully provide what they said that they were going to provide in the first place.      Maybe there just wasn't an editor at Bantam who was brave enough to say, \\"Excuse me, Drs. Hawking and Mlodinow, I'm not a world famous physicist, but I think that there might be some problems with the book.\\" Whether the problems were with the authors or the editor, it could have been better.

This book really took to me and I found myself not wanting it to be over once it was.   I definatly recommend this book. It's so unique and painfully honest. Im sure eveyone will be able to relate to it at one point or another.

0439023513|5.0|I loved the first two books and loved this one as well. I did have a hard time getting into it at first but after about a quarter of the way through it took off and I could hardly put the book down. I really didn't think I would see so many negative reviews on this book but it looks like everyone has their opinion on how it should end. That seems to happen with a lot of series. You have in your mind how you would like to see the book end and when it doesn't it is disappointing. I totally understand. I am just one of the reviewers here that did like the whole book and how it ended.<br />It starts of in District 13 right after the end of the Hunger Games. District 12 has been destroyed. There were some survivors that made it to 13 to seek shelter. Peeta is in the hands of the Capitol. Katniss is recovering from her wounds externally but internally she still hurts from all that she's been through. District 13 wants her to rise up and be the Mockingjay but all she can do is think about rescuing Peeta.<br />I still found the same exciting, nail biting scenarios as I did with the first one. If you liked the first two I pretty sure you'll like this one as well.
0517543052|5.0|Just every person that I showed this book was impressed on the different way it was written and strong meaning of its many short messages. I borrowed it from a friend, and just about every person that came across it in my living room, or wherever I carried or read it asked me what was this book. After a while with the book, I decided to buy it. Just today I watched Fierce Grace movie, and Baba Ram Dass was talking about situations where he met people in different places telling how the book changed their lives. If you are considering buying this book do not hesitate, buy it!
B003YMNVCA|5.0|The 3rd edition is great, the 4th edition updates that greatness. This book had been out for about a week when I noticed it and I had to get my hands on it!    There is a change I am bummed out about... They removed FreeBSD as one of their example systems but included OpenSolaris ( Oracle killed OpenSolaris after buying Sun). Thankfully FreeBSD has it's own Bible, [[ASIN:1593271514 Absolute FreeBSD: The Complete Guide to FreeBSD, 2nd Edition]], by Michael W. Lucas ( must have for FreeBSD admins).    Besides the OpenSolaris/FreeBSD change, this is still a solid book worthy of 5 stars. Since this might be the last edition of The Handbook I am glad to see an update. There is more Linux in this edition compared to the 3rd, they added a great introduction to scripting chapter, updated chapters for with the latest technologies, and removed references and chapters on obsolete tech.    If this is their last edition good way to go out. I hope someone else can put together a similar book for the future that can live up to this classic. Again, MUST HAVE!!!

0767827716|4.0|I'm a huge King fan, and likewise for Carpenter...so in my mind, even back then, when I heard John Carpenter was going to direct a Stephen King movie, I just KNEW it would be the gold standard for all King adaptations to follow.<br /><br />I have to say, whereas I really love this movie, that title still has to go to Hooper for his \\"Salem's Lot\\", but it really only won by a nose.<br /><br />Ah well...on with the show.<br /><br />This is a simple tale, really, of that ubiquitous Nerd Who Always Gets Picked On, his Jock With A Heart Of Gold best friend, and the Hot New Girl In School...and a black soul of darkness residing in an old car that our geeky hero decides he simply MUST restore, that hides more than fuel lines and exhaust manifolds beneath it's hood.<br /><br />First and foremost, this adaptation is a story of obsession that becomes possession.  Whatever malign entity (obviously female...of course, one of our characters points out that \\"All cars are girls\\") that dwells within that '58 Fury first entrances our poor, picked on youth, then, like a spider (or jealous seductress), ensnares his very soul within her web.  We see this innocent, just-wants-to-be-accepted guy, in his efforts to win some respect, instead be transformed into the very thing he hates, alienating all those that care for him (an allegory, perhaps?  Well, maybe it's there if you want it).  His friends, desperate to save him, are forced to confront the evil that has taken possession of him, and ultimately...<br /><br />Well, you know the rest if you've seen it.  If you haven't, I'm not going to ruin it.<br /><br />If you've read any of my other reviews, you might have seen that I am a big fan of \\"The Car\\", so making a car scary isn't that tough of a nut to crack in my opinion, and Carpenter did an outstanding job of making the auto a menacing, fearful juggernaut...although his \\"less is more\\" style really added to the film, his almost operatic quality imagery in some scenes was truly inspired (the flaming Plymouth careening wildly down the highway as it pursues it's prey is the stuff of nightmares).  As is his practice, there's no gore to speak of, but the dread his staging generates more than makes up for it.<br /><br />Suffice to say, an underrated and excellent little gem...I recommend it to King, Carpenter, and horror fans in general who aren't going to be disappointed if there's not a bloodbath.highway as it pursues it's prey is the stuff of nightmares).

0393072231|5.0|First, I think it's necessary to congratulate anyone who can write a page-turner about credit default swaps and collateralized debt obligations.  I'm not a structured finance expert so I can't speak definitively about the financial accuracy of the book, but I am an accountant and I can say it was both plausible and understandable.    I've read a number of criticisms of the book, some centering on the fact that he deals primarily (almost exclusively) with the Wall Street side of the crisis, rather than focusing on the fraud on the origination side, the government policies that contributed to the crisis, or the Fed's approach to interest rates.  To those comments, I would reply that Lewis wrote about the aspect of the crisis that he understood best from his own experience, and did it amazingly well.  It's all I could have asked for.    Other reviewers have commented that he tries to \\"have it both ways\\" by casting the Wall Street firms as both greedy and stupid.  I think he pretty persuasively makes the case for both.    This book, along with \\"The Black Swan,\\" should be required reading in finance curricula.

B002JVWQSW|5.0|In my opinion, this is one of the best and funniest first seasons of any television show ever produced.  It usually takes a show at least a few episodes to hit it's stride but this show was hilarious from the Pilot straight through to the final episode of the season.  The characters are well written and brilliantly acted - even the child actors are amazing - particularly Rico Rodriguez as wise-beyond-his-years Manny.  Best of all, the writers clearly write for and expect an intelligent audience to fully appreciate the humor.  If you missed any of the brilliant first season (or if you just want to see episodes over again as I do ) this DVD set should be on your must list!
B00127RAJY|5.0|Best workout ever. I love that it's only 20 minutes..I love that Jillian makes you feel like you can do anything..and I love that I don't have to go to the gym anymore. She kicks your butt, but in a good way. I wish that I could stay on track and do this everyday because I think that it would really make a difference. The other thing that I wish it had was a time clock in the corner of the screen so I knew how much longer I had to go. That seems to motivate me more.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|Installation was easy with my Rosewill Challenger case and MSI 870A-G54 motherboard. Didn't even need to remove the motherboard. CPU temp. has dropped by more than 10 degrees Celsius while folding on all 4 cores + the GPU. I used IC Diamond thermal paste. Fan has good airflow, I switched mine around so it would pull instead of push since it would interfere with the RAM heatsinks I have installed otherwise.    Removing the RAM will give you more room to work, it's easy enough to reinstall the RAM once it's in and plugged in.    It clears the side panel by about 1/4\\" on mine so check that you have enough room first! The dimensions are provided for a reason, use them. Like someone else said measure twice and order once. It's not the products fault if you don't know enough to plan ahead.    And like others have said the instructions suck for the most part. You're better off looking at the tiny pic with a magnifying glass to see the spacer placement, AND watching a couple install videos so you know what you're doing before you even stick your hands in the case.    The plastic fan clips work great and make it easy to remove and install the fan. Just be careful not to bend the fins of the cooler (should go without saying).    Shipping was fast, it arrived in 3 days of placing the order.
0812548094|5.0|Perfect sequel to the first with new characters, plots, and mystery. I really love this series so far. I especially like that the end of book is not a cliffhanger, but truly a end to that chapter in the overall saga. I definitely like that Richard's character is growing and I am excited to see the new things he learns in the later books. There are hundreds of other reviews that sum it up, but if you like classic fantasy (LOTR, Harry Potter, Eragon, etc...) this is right up your alley.

B003HARV98|4.0|I am a HUGE fan of Florence + the machine and have had her cd playing on rotation for over a year and while I can listen to Florence anytime of year and any day I am sure my family members are wary of Florence overload and so I have gone in search of some music along the same line. While Marina is not as haunting and dark as Florence's music it is still a great listen. Marina's lyrics are smart, her voice is wonderful and still has remnants of the haunting vocals that I adore with Florence. I would recommend this cd to other persons who are dying for another studio album by Florence and invite them to explore this artist who I have literally heard nothing up until a few weeks ago. Her voice is beautiful, powerful and (like Florence) I could listen to 'the family jewels' over and over again.

B001E2JNA6|5.0|So I purchased this blu-ray to watch with my wife.  I was completely not expecting to get near the enjoyment out of it that I did.  The cast was absolutely splendid.  Not only that, but unlike the very short movie version, this version really allowed the plot to develop out.  The characters were exceptionally true to form.  I dont think I could think of anyone better to play Mr. Darcy then Colin Firth.  Elizabeth Bennett was also perfectly cast right down to the smiling eyes.  What made this movie more fun was I watched it in conjunction with reading the book so basically I got a very good minds eye view of the story.  I realize in fairness this was a mini series so it had alot more space to do the story properly, but I cannot think of a more convincing and accurate portrayal of the story then this version did.  Lines were given verbatim, but not robotically instead with full emotional inflection and the dialogue seemed smooth and flowing instead of forced.  If anyone has ever watched a high school performance of macbeth, and then seen a high end production of it, I would say that would be the difference between the movie and the mini series.  I am a guy who normally doesnt go in for \\"chick flicks\\" but I found not only the book but the movie to be excellent.  I was caught up in the time period, and the set pieces in this mini series were so gorgeous that I felt transported back to the time.  My wife also thoroughly enjoyed it, and it has inspired me to broaden my horizons and try other Austen novels.  As a side note the bbc version of Emma was also very well done.

The music is plastic, the songs are lirically stupid and very silly    I can not say a lot of this, but it´s really hard for me to undestand why a lot of people love her    For a lot of people this woman seems to have discovered the music world, i think that she is nothing in special, just another average poppy and plastic singer.
B000022TSH|1.0|I ordered the original movie, Chinatown as pictured on the right but received the wrong version (Chinatown, Special Collector's Edition). I didn't realize this until after I opened it when my wife brought it to my attention. The Special Collector's Edition is the one with some bad reviews in reference to the scenes being to dark! They are correct, way to dark.  I do NOT recommend the \\"Special Collector's Edition\\"
B0037AGASG|1.0|First of all, is obvious that this kid was made for mainstream pre-teens market; I Have nothing against him, cause looks nice but the songs and concept are too stupid, boring and repetitive    We in this time need kids that really have to say something, I mean... if this guy make an purpousful album or try with really lyrics probably my opinion could be another one but me (and i guess that a lot of people too) are just annoyed with this kind of sub-products.

B002ZIAC26|2.0|bought the CD because of good reviews here and because they were opening for Vampire Weekend and I was going to the concert but, they are pretty boring -- every song last night sounded the same to me.  Two people in the crowd last night who claim to like them said that they play the CD as background music while they're at work, or at night to put them to sleep.  That's not what I'm looking for in my music, thank you.
6305807930|3.0|The visuals and atmosphere are all there, maybe not as close as suspiria but still I doubt another movie like Argento at his best will ever be done again. Other reviews here outline what happens, but what dissapointed me was the fact that this is nowhere near as gory or cringe-making as Argento's other works, such as Tenebre or Suspiria. A normal person would be sick and unable to look at the screen on those. but that's hardly the case here. With Argento you usually get to see blades going in, glass cutting slowly through flesh, heads being taken off right in front of you etc.. sick I know but that's part of the spice in his work. Here you don't get that, there is even one scene where a woman is attacked by cats. she just rolls around and it isnt that disturbing, but then when the killer goes to bring the knife down on her the scene fades to black and you don't get to see the stabbing, no blood, no knife going in, nothing. Anyone who knows Argento must know a scene like that is far off the mark for him. The visuals of the deaths were a big part of his films. Same thing when the guy gets his head chopped off in the river, there is no blood to speak off and it looks pretty tame by Argento standards. He didnt do the same beautiful, disturbing photography he is known for on the deaths. I was dissapointed with that, I like to be grossed out to the point where I have to turn away, but that never happened here.

B001XRLWPQ|5.0|Castle is plain awesomeness in TV show form.  It achieves a near perfect blend of mystery-solving, comedy, and seriousness.  Nathan Fillian is the Perfect actor for Richard Castle, and you can tell that he loves it!  This show would have only been Fillian antics if he wasn't balanced with Stana Katic's Kate Beckett.  The chemistry between the two is fantastic!  Loved it!
0439023513|2.0|After reading the first two books non-stop from one to the other, I knew I was addicted. Luckily for me, I had no idea about this trilogy until the second book was already released. Therefore, I consumed both books like a mad man. As with practically everyone else, I could hardly wait for the final book to this brilliant trilogy. Blah Blah Blah, you know the rest.<br /><br />After just finishing reading Mockingjay, I have to say that this book is by far the most disappointing book I have read in a while and I read a lot of books. This book felt like a slap in the face. I really don't know how to put it into words other than concluding that this is a very horrible book to a brilliant trilogy.<br /><br />There are so many things wrong with this book. I won't type up an incredibly long review because chances are if you read the other negative reviews of this book here on Amazon, they perfectly portray my feelings about this book as well.
B002ZG98C8|4.0|After his family is murdered by a powerful drug lord (Steven Seagal), ex-Federale Machete (Danny Trejo) becomes a day laborer in the States until he is pulled into an underhanded plot to guarantee the election of an anti-immigration right winger (Robert DeNiro) to the Senate.  Much bleeding and nudity ensues.    Writer/director Robert Rodriguez shares his colleague Quentin Tarantino's fascination with the exploitation cinema of the 70s, but Rodriguez has a purer vision.  He may not elevate his material with frequently inspired dialogue, but he also does not distract from his story with awkward, self-indulgent homages.  Rodriquez delivers a fast, entertaining, fun movie that one could imagine seeing in a grindhouse theater.  Trejo is the Mexican Charles Bronson that we didn't know we were waiting for.  It's a shame the guy is already 66 (!), because I'd like to see him crank out one or two hard and dirty thrillers a year for the next 20 years.  Even if I didn't see them, it would be nice just to know they were out there.  Seagal and DeNiro have a lot of fun with their roles.
B0002IQAN6|5.0|OK, I'll start off by saying I am real biased FOR this receording. I used to work at the Fillmore East and I was there for the weekend this concert was recorded. If you're an Allman Brothers fan there is no reason to have to convince you that this has some of the best live songs ever recorded. The band was hot and tight. One thing I loved was getting the long jams that are very different than the studio equivalents, if any. The Allman Brothers defined Southern Rock.    For the SACD abilities... The original recording was mastered by Tom Dowd and he had a hand on the SACD too. The only adjustments I make are when I want to emphasize something. Otherwise it's clean, open and mellow. At times you realy feel to be in the audience.    This recording is must for any Allman Brothers fan. For SACD/high resolution music/Allman Brothers fans, what are you waiting for?

B003X8597K|4.0|Normally an abridged version of an opera would not be something one would find acceptable, particularly when the production itself has been updated and modernised, but Wagner's 1842 opera Rienzi (Rienzi Der Letzte Der Tribunen) - almost forgotten but certainly eclipsed by the composer's next opera Der fliegende Holländer - is an opera in serious need of rehabilitation, not least because of the infamy of it supposedly being Hitler's favourite opera.  Cut down in half from its original five hour running time, the five acts compressed into two parts, this 2010 Deutsche Oper Berlin production, conducted by Sebastian Lang-Lessing and directed by pop-video and film director Philipp Stölzl, does however manage to give a new lease of life to the opera, or at least bring out elements in it that suggest that, for all its flaws and its troubled history, it's time the opera were confronted to determine whether its worthy of reconsideration and re-evaluation.    As the story deals with the rise and fall of the 14th century Roman dictator Cola di Rienzo, it seems appropriate in this production to emphasise the uncanny parallels that the opera has with the rise of Hitler and his downfall.  To not do so would be unthinkable, according to the director Philipp Stölzl, and indeed it's impossible not to see the remarkable coincidences in the common circumstances that give rise to a Rienzi here and those of Hitler, Mussolini, Stalin or Ceausescu.  Accordingly, being a German production, the opening part of Rienzi with the struggles between the Orsini and the Colonna factions, is clearly set in Germany's interwar years.  In the midst of these troubled times, Rienzi appears, promising to bring the people freedom, lead them out of their shame and make them a great nation once again, despite the warning from Adriano that \\"to reach your proud ends, you shall leave a trail of blood\\".    Brilliantly, the staging absorbs the cultural references of the times, Rome/Berlin looking like a backdrop of Fritz Lang's Metropolis with German Expressionist angles, while the warring Orsini and Colonna followers are masked and distorted like figures out of a colourful George Grosz painting.  This soon changes unsettlingly into the militaristic imagery of a fascist dictatorship, with propaganda films influenced by Leni Riefenstahl's Triumph of the Will playing out in the background.  As Rome enters into war in the second part of the revised opera, an increasingly embattled Rienzi is seen in a underground bunker, planning his grand vision of a new Rome while the reality above the ground is something quite different.  The parallels between Rienzi and Hitler are eerily premonitory, arising as much from the text of the libretto as the production design and never feeling forced.    Apart from the association of Wagner with the Third Reich, in almost all other respects, the Grand Opera of Rienzi scarcely feels like a Wagnerian musical drama.  The busy crowded staging and the huge rousing choruses are a recognisable feature and there are one or two prototype Wagner characters in this early opera, but otherwise the drama and storytelling is concise and to the point.  Not being familiar with the full 5-hour version of Rienzi, much of this however could be down to the tightening of the focus by the cutting down of the opera for this production, but the decision to revise the opera considerably seems justified by the results.    This is not a great Wagner opera by any means, certainly not when compared to Der fliegende Holländer which immediately followed it, but musically it's not a bad opera in its own right, with a beautiful overture, some wonderful symphonic passages, and there is a strong study of the conditions that give rise to a dictatorship in its drama.  It at least has a certain curiosity value in the fact that Hitler would have seen in this opera the means of his own rise to power and a premonition of his downfall, but it also has an interesting place in the history and development of German opera.    The Blu-ray edition of Rienzi has a 16:9 image that is just about flawless.  There's a strong 5.1 DTS HD-Master Audio mix, althuough I didn't notice any LFE subwoofer activity at all - your neighbours however will probably be thankful for this considering the force of the performance and the recording that is still evident.  The PCM stereo mix is also terrific.  A 27-minute Making Of is not particularly in-depth, but covers the background and the concept of this production through interviews and rehearsal footage.

0525951652|5.0|When Ken Follett's Fall of Giants arrived I was stunned at the size of the book.  Nearly a thousand pages were before me.  Then I wondered why I was surprised.  We're talking Ken Follett here.  Regardless of size, Follett's books are imminently readable and Fall of Giants is no different.  Perhaps the most amazing fact is that Fall of Giants is simply the first installment of a promised Century trilogy.  Amazing, but not surprising.  I can't wait.<br /><br />The story revolves around five European families from 1911 to 1925.  This period of time encompasses the First World War.  The period of late the Victorian Age was a time when society was rigid with \\"manners\\".  The upper classes new their place and weren't shy about letting everyone else know their place as well.  If the code of conduct was firmly set for the upper classes and royalty, so was it set for the lower classes as well!  If you were a member of the \\"working\\" class you knew who your \\"betters\\" were and behaved accordingly. Life was hard and took its toll on the masses.  Follett does a masterful job at describing the world as it existed at that time and he spends a good deal of time examining the class struggle which went on in much of Europe during this time.<br /><br />His characters are so numerous that he provides an index of them at the book.  In most cases he provides us with clear descriptions of those who inhabit his fictional world.  I can only assume that character development will continue in the two additional books we are promised.  I thought this was a strong point in Pillars of the Earth.<br /><br />The Fall of Giants is a sweeping novel not because of the time period it covers, only 14 years, but because of the story he is telling and because of the era in which it happens.<br /><br />Of all the authors I have read over the years it is James A. Michener that I remember most fondly.  His stories are so complete that after finishing one you really felt as though you had accomplished something.  You also learned because of reading them.  The Source really gives one the sense of the complexities in the Holy Land.  Texas, Poland, and Centennial, and others, not only told a story that entertained, but also taught the reader something.  Ken Follett is, in many ways, the same.  You will be much richer after reading Fall of Giants.<br /><br />I don't even think the length of the book is a negative.  I suspect that a competent editor could have found a way to pare down the size.  But some stories just take a while to tell.  Cutting is always an option, but only so much \\"fat\\" can be cut before you're into the meat, and this book is meaty.<br /><br />Try reading Fall of Giants, I think you'll be glad.  If you don't want to buy it, check it out from your library.  I don't think you'll be sorry for the effort.<br /><br />I highly recommend.<br /><br />Peace always.of reading them.

B000N3SRRC|5.0|The newest album for the band Clutch \\"From Beale Street to Oblivion\\" is a very inspiring album to think about things. The songs have alot of different meanings which can make you think hard about life just how the band is the way it is. The songs have a great sound to it, the lyrics are very outstanding in the way that Neil Fallon has put them together to make the song even more than better. The Album's songs may only sound good to a Clutch band lover but is still a very good album.
1573301183|5.0|Totally tragic, beautiful and awesome. I had been listening to the CD for several years before actually seeing the performance. I really didn't feel a need to see it since hearing the show was so good on its own. Seeing it brings in a whole new dimension. You see how the band interacts and you really get a feel for the energy in the room.     Then, of course, you get to see Layne. This was one of the last performances of AiC with Layne and you can tell that he's not at 100%. They hadn't had a show together as AiC in 3+ years, and a funny slip up in Sludge Factory shows it. That doesn't stop Layne or the band from delivering some emotional and electrifying songs though, and it's great to see them doing so well despite Layne's condition.     If you are a remote AiC fan or just like to see a good show get this DVD. It is totally worth it.

0061729078|5.0|This is an excellent book and really causes one to think twice about how we, as humans, tend to perceive and observe things.  I found that I was more open to the ideas the author was presenting after I read the book a few times.  Aldous Huxley is a fabulous author and this is one of his many great works that causes the reader to examine and reevaluate their thoughts and perceptions.
1439181780|5.0|I can't tell you how special this book really is.  I can recommend it to everyone and anyone who would really like to have a positive change in their lives, and quickly.  I have read everything you can think of on the subject of Love and how important it is in your life.  I have also read many books on how to create positive change in your life. The problem with most books I have read is they leave me still wanting and not knowing just how to make these changes. However, this book brings everything together in a simple, easy-to-understand manner that gave me the \\"Aha\\" moment I had been looking for all these years!  She explains the Law of Attraction fully but easily, and then shows you what it means to express and create real Love in your life--not meaning just about relationships and the things you normally love, but each moment and how it affects your whole life.      I used to \\"try\\" to be more loving, but when something went wrong, it was very easy to slip back into the excuse that the situation was too difficult to show love.  Now, once I have read just half the book, it is actually easier for me to not react negatively and without \\"trying\\" any more.  The author also tells you that you don't need to read The Secret, her previous book, to understand this one, and she is correct--this one wraps everything up in one neat package.  I get it now, and hope you will, too.     I always get my books from Amazon because they ship quickly even with regular shipping/super-saver shipping, and the prices are the best I have found.
0785814531|5.0|I bought this book because i wanted to have all of Edgar Allan Poe's stories and poems. From what i know this really is all of them, there is even a few critic reviews he wrote. Most likely the best book of all his writings out there. The binding is strong and the book isn't heavy at all. Was really surprised with how fast shipping was (got to my house a day before it said it would). I would highly suggest this to anyone wanting all his works in one volume.

Without excitement and passion, you're just going to get sour grapes.<br /><br />Gary's story is incredible and as he spins his yarn, he shows you step by step how he built his internet marketing empire by learning new skills, being open to opportunity and by being himself. No hype. No BS.<br /><br />This book is a must read for anyone at any level of their internet marketing career. And what is so great about this book is that it isn't dull and boring like a text book. Gary weaves his story throughout and shows you his somewhat humble and amateur beginnings and what he did and what mistakes he made along the way.<br /><br />His holistic approach to his work and his business is what inspired me to keep reading. He makes it real. And he makes it clear that internet marketing is for anyone... so long as you first start with your passion.<br /><br />He talks about first finding your passion, then committing to it, then how to form your personal brand around your passion and get to work building it, marketing it, monetizing it and as the title states CRUSHING IT! Everyone who wants to cash in on their passion must have this book on their book shelf.
0439023513|3.0|I won't go over the plot of the book as that has been well covered here. However, I must say that I absolutely loved, adored, and obsessed over the first two books. They were incredible.  The third book...not so much. In fact, I wondered if Suzanne Collins really even wrote it at times because it seemed to be completely out of character for her compared to the first two. Like another reader, I didn't read the book for a week or so after I got it because I didn't want the story to end, and I was so disappointed when I finally did read it. It's a good book though, just not in comparison to the other two.
1400052173|5.0|This book is a great read.  It explores how the world benefited from this one woman and how she truly made an impact on this planet.  I truly wish she and her family would be given more of the recognition so deserved.  The way society is and truthfully may not have changed, makes me sad. I think Henrietta is a female pioneer in so many ways.  This book captures that and is a page turner of historical proportions.

0978053583|3.0|I bought the actual Master Key Book (July 18th 2007 edition )after getting tired reading the pdf file downloading from The Secret web site.  This is a very profound self-help book.  So far, I'm on chapter three.  The content is very rich.  I re-read and re-listen to at least five times now.  In addition, I am still trying to release my tension during my meditation.  As of now, I have not manifesting things from reading this book so I give this book three stars.  However, I believe I have manifested things through listening The Secret Universal Mind Meditation. I also downloaded the Audible version but would prefer the CD because I find Amazon's Audible.com's propriety software is not quite user friendly.  I also strongly recommend the Think and Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill.
B003V5PPZG|5.0|Once again, Linkin Park has put out an album that is much different than previous ones. LP is definitely moving in a good direction. I've been listening to LP since their first CD came out, always anticipating their new albums with much excitement. This one, like their other albums, was worth the wait. My favorite songs are: \\"Burning In the Sky\\", \\"Robot Boy\\", \\"Waiting For the End\\", \\"Iridescent\\", and \\"The Catalyst\\". The whole album is incredible, although there is just one song I'm not crazy about: \\"When They Come For Me\\" has a lot of Mike Shinoda rap elements, which is usually good stuff, but I just don't really like this one. With that said, the rest of the album is full of songs that I never think about skipping. I like the excerpts that they included from speeches by Mario Savio and Martin Luther King Jr., check out \\"Wretches & Kings\\" and \\"Wisdom, Justice, and Love\\" for the speeches. While, some fans of LP's early work might not like this, I encourage those of you who haven't heard this album to give it a try. I have listened to it about 5 times today.
0385341008|5.0|How do you write a best-selling book that consists of nothing but letters?  It's what writers themselves call a `gimmick plot,' and while it's been done successfully in the past -- most notably with \\"84 Charing Cross Road\\" (which resulted in a superb film of the same name), such books defy reviewers' attempts to convey, through selective quotation, any of the flavor of great, `artless' writing such as this.<br /><br />That said, let's savor just one sample (my favorite) from a letter, late in the book. This is from a \\"Juliette to Sydney\\" letter, postmarked from the channel island of Guernsey to her editor in London. See if this doesn't speak to your heart.<br /><br />Dated \\"August 1946,\\" a year after the official end of WWII. Juliette writes,<br /><br />-----<br /><br />Isola was to speak at last night's society meeting [and] said they were letters to her Granny Pheen from a very kind man - a stranger - when she was but a little girl. Granny had kept them in a biscuit tin, and often read them to her, Isola, as a bed time story.<br /><br />Isola told us that when she her Granny was nine years old, her father had drowned her cat. `Muffin' had apparently climbed onto the table and licked the butter dish. That was enough for Pheen's beastly father -- he thrust Muffin into a burlap bag, added some rocks, tied up the sack, and flung Muffin into the ocean.  Then, meeting Pheen walking home from school, he told her what he'd done -- and good riddance, too.<br /><br />Then he'd toddled off to the tavern and left Granny sitting, plumb in the middle of the road, sobbing out her heart.<br /><br />A carriage, driven too fast, came within a whisker of running her down. The coachman rose from his seat and began to curse her but his passenger -- a very big man in a fine coat with a fur collar jumped out. He told the driver to be quiet, leaned over Pheen and asked if he could help her.<br /><br />Granny Pheen said no, she was beyond help. Her cat was gone! Pa had drowned Muffin and now Muffin was dead - dead and gone forever.<br /><br />The man said, \\"Of course Muffin's not dead. You do know cats have nine lives, don't you? I happen to know your Muffin was on her third life, and so she has six lives left.\\"<br /><br />Pheen asked how he knew. He said he just DID. He 'Always Knew' - it was a gift he was born with . . .<br /><br />The stranger sat down in the road beside her, closed his eyes and asked her to do the same in stillness and silence, then grabbed her little hand and exclaimed,<br /><br />\\"Ah yes! There she is! She's being born this minute! In a mansion --- no, a castle. There's a little boy stroking her. He loves her already and is going to name her . . . `Solange' . . . a strange name for a cat but still . . . She is going to live a long venturesome life with great spirit! I can tell already!\\"<br /><br />Granny Pheen told Isola she was so rapt by Muffin's new fate, she stopped crying. The man lifted her to her feet and said he would \\"call on Solange every once in a while and find out how she was faring and what she was up to.\\"  The man took down, \\"with a silver pen,\\" Pheen's name, and the name of the farm where she lived, \\"kissed her on the hand\\" and left.<br /><br />Absurd, all of this sounds, Sydney [but] Granny Pheen DID receive letters from the man - eight long letters over a year - all about Muffin's life as the French cat, Solange . . .<br /><br />I asked Isola if I could see the letters. Sidney, the writer had signed, with a grand flourish,<br /><br />Very Truly Yours,<br />O.F. O'F. W. W.<br /><br />Sidney - do you suppose? Could it possibly be . . . that Isola has inherited eight letters written by the man with such a preposterous name as \\"Oscar Fingal O'Flahertie Wills Wilde\\"?<br /><br />[Next chapter, a graphology expert down from London, \\"Sir William\\" examines the letters and, with the ladies holding their breath, announces with a little bow: \\"I am pleased to inform you madam . . . \\"]<br /><br />In a sort of afterward, the author, Annie Barrows says, of her Aunt and co-author Mary Anne Shaffer: \\"My family is rich in fine story-tellers, but my Aunt (who died in 2008) was the crown jewel in our crown.<br /><br />\\"She was one of the wittiest people I ever met. But wit wasn't the essence of her gift. Her language was lustrous, her timing exquisite, her delivery a thing of beauty and a joy forever. But none of these reaches to the center of her charm.<br /><br />\\"And that, it seems to me, was her willingness to be delighted by people - their phrases, their frailties, their fleeting moments of grandeur.<br /><br />\\"To tell a story is one thing; to commit to paper is another.

0439023513|1.0|I was very excited to read the third book and was very much empty when I finished it. The book was very well written and I think if it was a stand alone book I would have enjoyed it more but I felt like the characters were lost from the first two novels. It was a completely different story and not true to the first two.

0765326353|5.0|Anyone who really enjoys fantasy knows who Brandon Sanderson is. If you like fantasy and you haven't- look into him. You're seriously missing out. The way of kings is one of the best books that I've read in years. Honestly, it's one of the best books I've read, period. It's epic in a way that, as a reader, you almost never find. The entire world is made whole cloth, with an incredibly rich, well thought out history, a slew of fascinating, complex and evolving characters, the most interesting of which is the land in which the story is set. Mr. Sanderson spent more than a decade planning his epic, and it shows. He created an ecosystem as intricate and unique as that in Avatar, and developed the history of his world to a level that I've only seen in Tolkien himself. Every book that I've ever read by Sanderson has been a masterpiece in itself, but this is the work of his heart, something truly special.      I don't want to spoil anything- one of the best parts of the book is that you're constantly trying to figure this world out, and every time you think you have it, you realize that you were wrong, and an amazing new set of possibilities flies into view; and as always, his pacing is perfect. The Way of Kings is over a thousand pages, in hardcover, yet I couldn't set it down. Not once, in those thousand pages, did I lose the thrill of this world, and its incredible story. If you don't take my word for it, take the publishers. It wasn't by chance that he was asked to complete The Wheel of Time, nor that the publishers let him create a book over a thousand pages long, with twenty full page illustrations, and full color inside covers. That, for a book that is just the first part of ten. That's quite the risk- and it shows just how much they trust him as an author. And he managed to write it in less than a year, while writing the penultimate entry in The Wheel of Time. Amazing.     It's a beautiful book in every way~ I highly suggest you read it. I guarantee- you won't be disappointed.
0439023483|5.0|As a grown man it's been decades since I cried while reading a book, which is why I love and hate this book for making me mourn for a FICTIONAL character! Catching Fire (next in the series) was good (4 stars), but Mockingjay (last in the series) was a let down, especially due to the anti-climatic ending and also because of the senseless death of anyone dear to the protagonist...and to the reader.     Parental review: I let my 12 year-old daughter read this book after I read it, but rather than be crushed or dismayed by what happened throughout the story, she seemed a bit oblivious, almost as if it were over her head. I'm pretty sure I would not let <13 read the next book, and definitely not the last one in the series, with each sequel becoming more morbid than the last one.
B00003CXDB|4.0|I had never seen this movie, but the advertisement for the sequel had me interested in it. I purchased & am very pleased. Gecko puts Bud at one of lifes crossroads. Should he choose money & perks for the small price of his soul? I enjoyed watching it & I think that if the sequel is 1/2 as good as this I will buy it also!!!
B002KQ6BT6|3.0|This book is just OK.  Compared to the first two books (Angels & Demons, The Da Vinci Code), this book is not as fast paced, not as interesting.  I did not find myself wanting to read more.  It is a decent read but if you want a great read this book is not just it.
0553805371|1.0|As a couple of other readers shared, I too have a background in physics and math.  Does that make me an expert?  An Einstein?  Does that make Mr. Hawking an Einstein equivalent?  The answer to all of these is of course a resounding NO.  What Hawking fails to explore, is the truth that Einstein in fact concluded that God must exist and in fact created life.  For out of nothingness comes the same.  Nothing.  Name something in creation that did not have an origin.  The answer is...nothing.  Thus any sensible person can only conclude that Hawking, despite being incredibly intelligent, is also, a fool.
B00005JT6F|4.0|I am a big fan of America, well to be more precise of their self titled debut and second album, Homecoming.  From those two come the classic tracks A Horse With No Name, I Need You, Sandman, Ventura Highway, Don't Cross The River, To Each His Own and Only In Your heart.  All entirely essential acoustic guitar folk rock.  For me the problems start when (Sir) George Martin gets involved, Muskrat Love is as bad as it gets, but Tin Man, Woman Tonight, Amber Cascades and others just can't get near the sheer quality of the earliest work.  Sister Golden Hair is a notable exception and You can Do Magic is OK.  4 stars sure enough, if only they could have maintainted the highest standards they set themselves from 1971/1972.
B002ZG993Q|1.0|I've been a George Clooney fan for years and, as such, have come to accept that you don't quite know what you may get from one movie to the next.  Some have been quite good; others pretty forgetable...  This one, though, is more  unforgiveable...    Part of the problem is the trailer, which I found misleading.  This is neither an action film nor a thriller - as the trailer infers - but more of a drama.    The rest of the problem is the film is pretty uneven and ends rather inexplicably and abruptly.  After enduring all the pensive moments and dragging pace of this film, it wraps things up in a matter of seconds.    I saw the movie with a couple friends and we all looked at each other at the end and said the same thing - \\"Is that it?!?\\"  And after processing what we'd just sat through, we came to the same conclusion: we're done with Clooney films.  This one was too great a sucker punch and too much a waste of time.    Sorry, George!
B000R4SMCW|5.0|If you like Anthony Hopkins & like to solve mysteries, then this is for you.  The pace wasn't always as fast as i generally like, but once into the story line, it was intriguing.
B003V5PPZG|1.0|Well a buddy of mine bought this cd and we listened all the way through it and he hated it so he gave it to me.  Well I listened to it again all the way through and I have to say this cd is just horrible.  I absolutely loved meteora and hybrid theory and reanimation.  Minutes to midnight well that cd was ok but was the beginning of the end for LP.  I absolutely hate this new sound or direction LP is going.  It is horrible. They act like they want to sound like u2 or I'll even say john mayer well then that's their choice but I and many others won't be listening to your crappy music any more.  This cd from beginning to end is just flat out horrible.  I mean even m2m was listenable.  I mean barely but still had a couple catchy songs.  NONE TO BE FOUND ON THIS CD.  So do yourselfs a favor people and save your money.  Until LP gives us another great CD and at least sounds similar to the old LP I'm not gonna be listening to your crappy new sound.
B003V5PPZG|5.0|I wanted to hate this album for the same reasons I was disappointed with M2M. LP changed it's sound, it's a fact, but whatever remedy they put inside these waves in Thousand suns makes me want to listen more and more. I liked the album, just close your eyes in Waiting for the End and you'll see what I mean. If this is a step towards a better LP sound, then I'm front row.
B0032JTV74|4.0|I was thrilled when my pre-order of the 1st season of Glee came today and couldn't wait to start watching.  I don't know if I just got a bad copy but, the first episode was the directors cut and the sound was not synced to their lips- pretty annoying.  I randomly watched another episode and some of the special features and there was no problem with the syncing.  There are a lot of fun features on the 4 disc set, but there is NO way to tell what is on each disc before you put it in, would it have been so hard to slip in a guide?      I am looking forward to many hours of GLEE-ful enjoyment, and hope there are no more glitches with my discs.
0780622650|2.0|I was never a fan of the original \\"Lost in Space\\" TV show, so I didn't know what to expect when I saw the '98 film adaptation. Well, I'm not a fan of this film, either. This is not a fun sci-fi movie: the characters are dull and annoying (Penny and Will Robinson, especially), the acting is wooden (except for Gary Oldman), the dialogue is stiff, and the story is nothing special (and it does get way too complicated in the third act), and even set designs are not really interesting to look at. I'll give the movie credit for Oldman's performance and for its special effects, which are actually pretty decent. Besides that, this movie is really lame. It's not one of the worst movies ever made, but it's still boring, silly, and downright unenjoyable.<br /><br />Grade: 3/10
0307454541|5.0|I had heard all the hype about this book but somehow or other, had never got round to reading it.  Then my Dad out of the blue recommended it, and I thought I have to read it.  This fast-paced thriller is a book everybody should read.  It's well-written and is so gripping, you'll be like me and read the last 300 pages in one go.  The only problem with the book, is that you'll find it hard to do you work and other chores, you'll just want to keep on reading.<br />The plot is complex but well-woven.  The heroine is unlike any other heroine you've ever encountered.  It's just brilliant.
0765326353|5.0|I can't go into much detail without spoiling much, but this was an amazing book. The world building was awesome, and yet it kept you grasping for more. The POV chapters with the characters were also very well done. In Dalinar's chapters, you also get to see into the mind of his son, so you're not just getting the POV of the character the chapter is supposed to be about. I really enjoyed Kaladin's chapters, though. He was a strong character, and I really liked the spren. I hope Sanderson comes out with more of this series soon. Even at a 1000 pages, it wasn't enough! I want more and I want it now. Sanderson is the new king of epic fantasy. RIP Robert Jordan and JRR Tolkien, but have faith that there is a man worthy of your title.
B0036TGSR6|4.0|This was not only a great movie but an entertaining story from the first frame until the last. This would be a great movie to see while Tony Blair is running around the U.S. pushing sales of his just released memoirs. The movie is fiction of course but it draws on recent headlines involving Great Britain and its ties to the U.S. but more specifically the British PM and his ties to George W. Bush, and the runup to the Iraq war. That is the backdrop of the movie but it is really a story about average people getting caught up in extraordinary events. As others have said this is a movie that Hitchcock could have made. Think \\"Foreign Correspondent, North By Northwest, or The Man Who Knew Too Much\\". It helps that the movie was based on a well written book by Robert Harris, a first rate author of popular fiction, who collaborated with Roman Polanski in developing the screen play. This is a political thriller that has a lot of ironic humor in it. The dialogue is pitch perfect, the cinematography is well crafted, the actors superb; they fit into their characters like a nice leather glove. This was one of my favorite movies of the year.
B000UZNSWM|5.0|No question in my mind that Halberstam was a great writer. I could not put this down. Yes, we know what happened but do we really? The actions of the war and the homefront are so well assembled.<br /><br />Halberstam has a view and he spills his guts to support it. In Korea he sees MacArthur as deeply flawed, exercising horrific judgment based on vanity and ego and surrounding himself with sycophants that told him only what he wanted to hear. He caused much unnecessary suffering and challenged the power of the Commander in Chief.  While MacArthur is central to the history of the Korean War, Halberstam pulls back from the battles to give a fuller picture of the political winds blowing in China, Russia and United States that lead to misunderstandings (America not mentioning the Korea peninsula as under is \\"shield\\" was a major blunder) at almost every instance.<br /><br />The US had a skewed view of China presented by a 100 years of missionaries that was contradictory to Mao's growing success in fighting the Nationalists and therefore could not be \\"true\\".  Halberstam helps explain how the defeat of the Nationalists triggered some sense in Americans  that the US had lost to Mao. He does a great job refuting that but showing how the Republicans and Joseph McCarthy used this issue to show the Democrats as weak on Communism and trigger the Redbaiting that destroyed so many careers and reputations. Thus the Korean War took on added significance as it was seen as repulsing the Communists (as was Vietnam) rather than a nationalist uprising or civil war.<br /><br />Since the US had said Korea was not under their protection Mao saw an opportunity and he equally could not back down once he was committed to action. And of course could Stalin have it any better? The US tied up in Korea fighting a very large Chinese army?<br /><br />Halberstam's view is that while communism is the form of government that many countries took after WWII it was NOT a global movement but a series of nationalist battles for freedom from the Colonial era. While not the only one with this theory he does a wonderful job making his arguments.  I could go on an on about how much can be gained by reading the book. Great history points and a very sincere effort to say \\"hey, there is actually some black and white here and I going to try to explain it\\".<br /><br />The battle scenes are excellent and I do wish he had spent some time on the Chosin Resevoir Breakout as it appears to be one of the most heroic battles in American military history. I very much appreciated how he studied the battles, interviewed relentlessly and paints a very human picture of soldiers under the greatest of physical stress acting with intelligence, bravery, loyalty and heroism. Clearly Band of Brothers.<br /><br />Last but not least - Korea itself. What a remarkable country. To have been so systematically torn apart by the Japanese and other invaders for so long to the point where there really was nothing; no indigenous structures for government, education, health, infrastructure. Just nothing. And yet today it's a world leader in many industries and a prosperous interesting place. That came about through the hard hard work of the people. Americans can claim some credit but for the most part the success of South Korea is another story that needs to be told.m from the Colonial era.

0618918248|3.0|The book is full of cliches like: religion is opposed to breakthroughs in science, Darwin's evolution theory somehow calls into question the existence of God, if not for religion there would be no war, etc.  As you would expect from a God-less leftist, the author is childish, pedantic, sarcastic, condescending to us poor naifs and very very angry. Unfortunately he is also devoid of reason.  His proof that there is no God goes something like this:  The odds of life existing on any planet is about a billion billion to one.  But there is life on this planet so we are already in the anthropic zone and have beaten all the odds.   Therefore that proves that life started, from nothing, because the odds against it were so great. We just don't know exactly how that happened but when we find out then you will know that there is no God.  Really? Is that all you got?
B003OF3R0S|5.0|This was the first music I have actually listened to from A7X.  I have heard of the band, but never heard their music.  I love the disc, and was hooked from the first track, Nightmare.  If you're a fan and have yet to see them perform live, you must!  I just watched them at the Uproar Fest and they put on a top show!
B003JTHESA|3.0|I have been a fan of Iron Maiden since \\"The Number Of The Beast\\", and as a collector, I have each and every studio album of Iron Maiden (and some of the Live albums, as so some of the extra tracks). After hearing \\"Killers\\", I knew that it will be MY ALL-TIME-FAVOURITE Iron Maiden album. I've been enjoying each new album, until Somewhere In Time, which is, for me, one of the worst Maiden albums of all time. But \\"Seventh Son of a Seventh Son\\" retook the place of Maiden in me... After that \\"No Prayer for the Dying\\" disapointed me somewhat, but rebirth with \\"Fear of the Dark\\" and \\"The X Factor\\". \\"Virtual XI\\" slipped again (greately!), but a new reborn was felt with \\"Brave New World\\". And that's it...<br /><br />Every following album sounded to me boring, with worse and worse sound quality. I really think that Harris' hands in the production are really harmful, because some of the songs could be really catchy, but the sound quality makes them sound boring, dull. I think that Iron Maiden needs other producer that could get the best sound from Maiden songs to achieve that energy present in \\"Killers\\", \\"The Number of the Beast\\" and others... Maybe maideners are bored to be stars since 30 years ago, but we as maidenists, specially me, really wanted to hear the power, freshness, energy, passion, riffs, inspiration and light that Iron Maiden emanate somewhere back in time.<br /><br />BTW: This record is better than \\"Dance Of Death\\" and \\"A Matter Of Life And Death\\". But its sound is MORE boring than the other two.
B002BVYBC4|1.0|I was disapointed to open it and find that it was not the special edition so I had to return it just to pay $3 more to buy from another site
B003V5PPZG|2.0|WOW, this cd is BAD. The first two songs are basically 11 second supposed concept instrumentals which don't really make sense unlike Trent Reznor's 'apocalypse' intro at the beginning of Year Zero. When the third song(which finally has vocals) breaks, it sounds like something with Enrique Iglesias on the beach. Then you get two more pointless instrumentals before a pretty decent semi hip-hop track that gets ruined when Shinoda raps \\"I'm no robot and I'm not a monkey, I will not dance even if the beat's funky\\" To which I say no truer words have been spoken Mike! Finally, you get a few more instrumentals (which are all but progressive) and actually quite boring. There is one decent heavy track on the album, that plus the single,'The Catalyst' were Great and fooled me into thinking this was gonna be something exciting. There is even a song where Mike and Chester have a tinge of dare I say reggae in their voice? I agree with the previous comment that the entire record which I have listened to over and over again to try to like feels like maybe 4 completed songs; in which only 2 are good in my opinion. I'm not hating on Linkin Park for the sake of it, I am simply saying this particular release is too minimal to appreciate.
0553805371|5.0|Believing in \\"God\\" just got a lot harder...<br /><br />\\"Modern physics leaves no place for God in the creation of the universe,\\" the preeminent physicist Stephen Hawking has eloquently and convincingly deduced in his new book, \\"The Grand Design.\\" \\"Far from being a once-in-a-million event that could only be accounted for by extraordinary serendipity or a divine hand, the Big Bang was an inevitable [and natural] consequence of the laws of physics.\\" -Professor Stephen Hawking, \\"The Grand Design.\\"<br /><br />Science and scientists, since Nicolaus Copernicus first deposed the Earth from the hub of the universe, has been able to explain successfully, in naturalistic terms, countless events that were once believed to be the actions of a supernatural and celestial agency. Ideas and concepts, such as Evolution, which supplanted creationism--when tested in the crucible of modern science, frequently, and with exceedingly, hard-fought victories, continues to defend a natural causation for the world around us...not one based upon a supernatural, interventionist force.<br /><br />And now, finally, Stephen Hawking's new book, \\"The Grand Design,\\" has dealt a final death knell to the myth of a theistic dawn of our universe--no less, at the cosmological level--in the same manner Charles Darwin invalidated the notion of a divine, immutable origination of species on Earth. God simply has nowhere left to go but into the dusty halls of mythology, and onto the pages of historical textbooks, as pure science fiction and flights of fantasy, not empirical science and provable fact.<br /><br />If there is no need for a universal creator--as Hawking now unequivocally states, then, there is no longer a need, or even a discussion, for the mere \\"concept of a god,\\" let alone a valid belief in an actual, supernatural designer of the universe.<br /><br />Creationists will croak out feckless pleadings of \\"foul!\\" and religionists will delve deeper into the abyss of abysmal apologia for their imaginary god(s), but the concept of a god as a cosmic architect just collapsed like a house of cards!cosmic architect just collapsed like a house of cards!
B003V5PPZG|5.0|This is not the same style as Linkin Park has done before, ever.  That said this album is a deep artistic accomplishment and stands on its own merits.  It is of a different genre and style than Linkin Park's previous efforts and if you view Hybrid Theory as being the BEST Linkin Park has done this this album will underwhelm you.  This is not the kind of music you can always easily play video games to, which is neither here nor there.<br /><br />If you purchase this album and listen to it entirely through in one sitting you will not regret this purchase.  The art is powerful, and requires deep thinking.  Jornada Del Muerto is sung in Japanese and translating what they say improves the power of it dramatically.  Don't trust anyone comparing this to Linkin Park's previous efforts -- It has no comparison.
B001PB3RU8|5.0|Such an awesome cd. Took me forever to listen to but once i finally did it stayed on repeat. Love blinding and drumming best songs on the album.
B002RWKSII|5.0|If you like Brian Wilson and the Beach Boys and if hearing Ira Gershwin compositions makes you swoon and tap your foot, you're  going to be amazed at how seamlessly their two styles mesh together in this great CD.  At first I thought that it was an unlikely combination but as soon as I heard \\"S'Wonderful\\" in the typical Beach Boys style it was like the song was written for him to sing.  And \\"The Like in I Love You\\" is almost reminiscent of \\"In My Room\\" or one of the other Beach Boy Ballads.  I can almost imagine everyone bopping around on the beach among the surfboards when listening to \\"I've Got Rhythm\\".<br /><br />Two thumbs up for this great collection and to Brian Wilson for taking the chance to create something truly unique.  S'wonderful!
B0015DROBO|1.0|This book is completely one linear.  I think it really comes down to this...If you enjoyed the Davinci Code, then you'll love this book.  I did not like the Da vinci Code, and thought it was horrible. Hence,...I did not like this book.<br /><br />I felt like the whole book was kind of silly.  They give away (SPOILER ALERT!!!!) the beginning just by the individual who is sending the flowers.  After that, you pretty much know who is doing what.  I also felt the violence depicted in the book was pointless.  There was no need to go so graphically detailed into the horrific scenes.  But then again, maybe violence can only ever be depicted as graphic (thus, its repulsiveness).<br /><br />I call this one dimensional linear reading, becuause whenever they characters would hit a roadblock, some type of co-incidental break through would occur.  (SPOILER ALERT!!!) For example, how is daughter breaks the code in Harriet's diary.  Can you say...LAME.  I can, L A M E.<br /><br />I don't hate the book, I just wish I never read it...I could have read so many other works.  BUT! this book has brought some joy in other people's lives...so once again, if your fond of 1 dimensional, no depth characters with a linear plot...then...by all means...you should read this book.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I have a gym membership and I guess I did not push to my fullest potential, even with mixing cardio and strength training. I have spent an hour each time at my gym and I did not sweat NEARLY as much as I did with this workout which was like 27 minutes long WOW!! I read a few of the reviews here and we all seem to say the same thing (more or less) Jillian KICKS YOUR ARSE! Let me add also, I try NOT to purchase any workout videos, as I am the \\"try it before you buy it\\" kind of gal. Instead, I went to my local library and checked it out for free. I think I may end up buying her series of DVDs from Amazon.com of course! But WOW I could not believe how much MORE effective her workouts are compared to the gym equipment! Additionally, I WAS cussing Jillian out a few times and said I HATED her ha ha but none the less, I think I am going to have a wonderful hate/love relationship with this trainer :)

0439023491|3.0|I have so far read the first two books in the series and I am having trouble finding the reason for their popularity.  Both of the books so far have come across to me in two parts: the first part is outside of the arena of the games; the second part in inside of the arena.<br /><br />Once Collins pulls her characters into the arena, the books have been a page turning extravaganza keeping me up too late.  However, it takes entirely too long to get there, and as good as Collins is with action is how bad she is with exposition and explanation.  I think for me this is because I still cannot suspend disbelief about the world Collins builds and I keep questioning its logic as a coherent world.  The first half of the books have both been slow and plodding and full of contradictions (or apparent contradictions if you want to give her the benefit of the doubt).  That this exists at all is confusing and brought into stark contrast with the even smaller world she builds within the games themselves and is fantastic.<br /><br />My sense is that she should have undertaken the excision that Rowling does as she continues on in the series where the outside world just ceases to exist.  That will not be possible in the third book because the compelling part of the series this far has been destroyed.  My only hope is that her prowess for action will carry over to the final book, which I will move along to shortly.
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect with this movie. Like many, I've heard the theme song over and over and covered many times. I really liked it and the reviews on the movie were good. So I picked up a used copy.<br /><br />It was wonderful. So unlike most American movies, it was unique, unpredictable and heartwarming.<br /><br />The two leads are well played, raw, honest and never seemed like 'acted' roles.<br />There is quite a bit of adult language though so it is not for the younger crowd. The actor's heavy accents can also get in the way of comprehension but for the most part are understandable.<br /><br />Besides the music being great, the relationship between \\"guy\\" and \\"girl\\" (you never know their names) is terrific. They both hold their own ground and play on each other well. They are a great compliment to each other. \\"Guy\\" is rough, angry and struggling. \\"Girl\\" is softer, motherly, and friendly.<br /><br />One of my favorite scenes is \\"girl\\" walking around town pulling her vacuum along like a pet, in the hopes that \\"guy\\" can fix it.<br /><br />Despite the cover photo, this is not really a romantic love story. But the tension is there nonetheless.<br /><br />Well worth a watch.

B0034EEE2E|5.0|Teen Dream, at heart, insightfully explains itself. You've got the somnolent fade-in (\\"Zebra\\"), the distressed mid-dream drama (\\"Norway\\"), the period of regretful reminiscence (\\"Used to Be\\"), the youthful anthem (\\"10 Mile Stereo\\"), and then you've got the tearful finale (\\"Take Care\\").<br /><br />But Beach House gives us something extraordinary. Victoria Legrand's sweltering, sonic prayers echo brightly through the halls of a converted cathedral, and swim carelessly in holy matrimony with Alex Scally's dreamy string decrees. Pulsating keyboard portions are escorted fondly by gleeful, synergetic tambour beats and tambourine feet. Unearthly bubbling babels evolve briskly into swellings of gritty guitar strokes and airy vocal proclamations. An enchanting world of familiar visions fuses fluidly with surreal scenes of extrasolar experiences.<br /><br />And amongst the collusion of far-off \\"Walk[s] in the Park\\" and illusions of \\"Better Times,\\" there is an understated sentiment that is so grippingly human and so achingly intimate that when the record is over, the listener truly feels as if they have been awakened from an epic slumber. It's the yin and yang power that Beach House has previously indicated, but hasn't quite dominated until Teen Dream.<br /><br />And it makes for one heck of a ride.<br /><br />(One of the best of the year so far, hands down.)
B003X27L9U|5.0|I have just finished reading this compelling novel. I won't explain the story as this has been done in detail by the previous reviewers. Suffice to say that I was quite amazed by the way the author takes us inside the mind of five year old Jack in a quite believable way.It's an extraordinary story and well worth reading. give it a try!
B002P7UCMC|5.0|...the sound of this new album. It's a mix of the old Rammstein with some new technology and something completely new. This is unlike any of their old albums by any stretch of the imagination. While Rosenrot had a few great songs, some more stilted than others, Liebe Ist Fur Alle Da is a free for all of metal!     From the Pop-ish sound of \\"Pussy\\" to the in your face bonecrusher \\"Ich Tu Dir Weh\\", Liebe Ist Fur Alle Da breaks new ground rather than retread it like Rosenrot seemed to do. Many of the songs feel like they have an older Metallica-like anger driven rush, thundering away razor-edged power chords of \\"Weiner Blut\\" and \\"Ich Tu Dir Weh\\" with great relish. \\"B********\\" is quite frighteningly dark, even for me. I LITERALLY got chills listening to Till growl almost hellishly in my ears, then pull of one of those larynx smashing metal screams of his... absolute bloodcurdling.     Moving on into the more lighter side of the dark, Fruhling in Paris sounds like it should be a in movie somewhere as to how catchy it is. \\"Mehr\\" and \\"Roter Sand\\" both a have a cinematic, opera-like atmosphere, where as \\"Liese\\" and \\"Roter Sand (orchestrated)\\" seem to fit into The Good, The Bad and The Ugly with Clint Eastwood staring you down.     With a Jaws-like opening, \\"Haifisch\\" adds a bit of comical humor to the set, being that its a song about a shark (haifisch) that is sad and that one can see him crying in the sea. \\"Waidmann's Heil\\" starts with this rather hilarious fanfare then turns metal suddenly and literally rocks your socks off with it's almost \\"Ghost Riders in the Sky\\" choir. \\"Pussy\\" falls into that category of wtf? Believe it or not it's quite infectious the chorus line and makes you wonder why you aren't.... well... *evil laugh*.     Fuhre Mich, Donaukinder, and Halt fall into any category really, but musically they are songs that are worthy of single in my opinion.

0634049011|5.0|Everything is explained very well, for the first time I believe I have found a book that will make a huge difference in my ability to play the guitar after many years of hit and miss. This book helps you understand what is going on and how to figure out what you want to do without constantly referring to pictures and charts. You'll have the keys to map it out on the fly once you become accustomed to recognizing the various patterns, intervals, and scales with the easy, non-rote method used to simplify the organization of the fretboard as it applies to music theory. This book has helped my interest grow towards mastering the instrument eventhough I was just looking for some instruction on playing my own accompaniment when I sing. I see that I'll be able to do a lot more and know how to figure out things I imagine myself playing for that unique sound and style so I don't have to copy others. If you are serious about playing guitar or want to become expert at playing lead get this book and you might look into getting the Washburn Rover travel guitar check it out Amazon's got the best price. No I don't work for either Amazon or the author, I'm just happy to pass along good info to other players.
0307266303|5.0|McDougall combines great storytelling, effective journalism, and comprehensive research into a book that, quite simply, should be read by everyone who has a love, interest, or even a vague concept of running.  I finished the book in about three sittings, devouring it as voraciously as a good meal.  It's message is simple, yet staggeringly profound: we as a species are born and bred to run.  It will reshape your perception of this very basic act.  Running is not something we have done through the ages as exercise.  It was inextricably intertwined with our survival.  It's how we hunted and escaped danger.  Before we fashioned spears, we ran.  Before we shot bow and arrow, we ran.  It was our first work of art.  We did it in bare feet or light shoes.  We ran with better form: toes down, landing with the front of the foot, absorbing the impact with the entire foot instead of just the heel.  We ran light and smooth.<br /><br />This book recaptures that love of running our species once had.  If you read this book, you will want to run.  I had not run in years.  I suffered from repeating stress injuries, mostly shin-splints.  After finishing this book and doing a little research of my own, I finally just kicked off my shoes and ran.<br /><br />It was wonderful.
B002HK9IDQ|5.0|This is a lovely victorian drama, with absolutely first rate acting and wonderful music.  I bought it because my daughter likes musicals and I wanted to provide something with more nuance than MTV videos.  Happily, she loves it and watches it with delight several times per year.  It has nurtured her love of music, moving it in new directions.  I couldn't be happier with it.<br /><br />Warmly recommended.  This is magical.
B00005JMEW|5.0|While he may be best known for his stunning '94 masterpiece `Pulp Fiction', much of Quinton Tarantino's debated celebrity lies in the midst of his two-part epic `Kill Bill'.  For the sake of this review, I'm mainly going to focus on the first volume (the second volume is very good, but pales in comparison to this highly inspired first part).  It seems that you either love this film (unapologetically) or you hate it with a passion.<br /><br />I love it!<br /><br />The tale is rather simple.  There is an assassin known mainly as The Bride who is ambushed on her wedding day by her former associates.  Her fianc&eacute;e is killed, as is her unborn child, and she is left for dead.  Thankfully, she lives...but then again, her fellow `hired hands' aren't too thankful.  After The Bride awakes from her coma, she sets off on a revenge filled journey to hunt down her former boss, Bill, and kill him.<br /><br />That doesn't happen in this volume, but this first half of The Bride's destiny is by far the most entertaining.<br /><br />Like I said, the concept and story is rather simple (although it is clearly inspired by `The Bride Wore Black', and you can't go wrong with updating Truffaut!).  That said; this film lives and dies in the hands of Quinton Tarantino.  While the story itself may be simple, the execution is not.  Tarantino is above all else a stylistic director.  He has a clear vision as to how he likes to work things out.  If you take the conversational awkwardness of Woody Allen, the layered storylines of Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu, the gritty aggression of Martin Scorsese and then filter in influences that range from Japanese Anime and `Matrix' style imagery to dusty John Wayne movies you'd have a Quinton Tarantino flick.  Somehow, Tarantino makes it all work.  I think that is what makes these movies so brilliant.  They are unlike anything you've ever seen before.  They are bright and flashy and engaging and thrilling.<br /><br />They are smart.<br /><br />By pulling Uma Thurman back out of the slums and handing her this role, he re-birthed her so-to-speak.  She really needs to work with him again before she disappears completely (why does she lack a solid career?).  As The Bride, Thurman really shines.  She understands how to create a character that is complete with every ounce of stylistic unreality that Tarantino demands, yet flushed with a sincere sense of reality that keeps her raw and unnerving to the audience.  It's a brilliant turn that deserved all the praise and accolades it garnered.  The supporting cast also works magic here (although it is very true that the second film fairs better in that department, with Daryl Hannah's hissing through her scenes and the late great Carradine adding a much needed layer of nuance to the film).<br /><br />Overall, `Kill Bill, vol. 1' is a slam dunk.  Each frame shimmers forth with excitement that encompasses everything needed to create a fully realized slice of worth-while (and highly memorable) entertainment!g Uma Thurman back out of the slums and handing her this role, he re-birthed her so-to-speak.

B001LMU182|5.0|In an alternate 1988 where World War III occur in Tokyo, 30 years later in 2019 as it's now dubbed Neo-Tokyo where technology roams, politicians runs the city and anti-government terrorists are hidden. A gang of bikers lead by Kaneda just had their usual battle against a rival gang called \\"The Clowns\\" until one of the good biker members named Tetsuo Shima gets into an accident, he is taken away by soldiers to a special hospital. Tetsuo goes through experimentation of a project called \\"The Akira Project\\" that gives him unique powers of ESP/telekinesis for it leaves some of his friends mainly Keneda who just fell for a girl terrorist named Keye worried. Tetsuo goes berserk with his powers as he terrorizes the city through a rampage of destruction until he can find the source of his powers known as Akira.<br /><br />A brilliant, beautifully animated and visually stunning Science Fiction action thriller from Japan that is considered the ultimate anime movie ever and it is. Katsuhiro Otomo who created the manga comics in 1982 has written, produced and directed this masterpiece of cinema for it was unleashed in Japan back in 1988 to become one of the highest grossing movies in the countries history. In 1989 when it hit the United States by Streamline Pictures (An MGM company) in theaters it became a sleeper hit mainly in arthouse theaters in the cities then it took the world by storm re-establishing and making Japanimation popular. Although it's not quite as excellent as the Manga that spawned this movie, it's still a masterpiece of animation and Science Fiction that offers a complex storyline, awesome characterization, action (complete with gore), a memorable music score and it's also about questioning the existence of humanity or what if we messed with something that wasn't meant to be opened. This movie was praised and favored by many Hollywood filmmakers such as James Cameron, Steven Spielberg, The Wachowski Brothers, Michael Bay, Jonathan Mostow, Ridley and Tony Scott, Christopher Nolan and so much more as it's an influential work of art that still has it's audience today.<br /><br />I remembered when i was 14 years old in May of 1996 after reading an amazing article on Japanese animation in Newsweek that stated everything from Akira, Ghost in The Shell, Totoro, Ninja Scroll, Grave of the Fireflies and others. I soon became interested as i rented this from one of the local movie rental stores and loved it! I had my share of previous experiences in anime since i was a kid with Voltron, Jack and The Beanstalk, Unico and more but Vampire Hunter D in 1993 on TBS was awesome as was Robot Carnival. This movie made me a bigger anime fan that i am today and became my favorite animated movie.<br /><br />This Blu-Ray offers perfected sound and picture quality that is high definition heaven with extras being teasers and trailers with storyboards.

B00006JDVV|1.0|I remember when the film was released.  It looked so promising.  Christian Bale is a brilliant actor and always seems to carry his films, even the ones that aren't worth carrying, and Matthew McConaughey may not be my favorite actor (I actually find him very overrated) but he has a certain amount of charm that tends to work in his behalf.  Throw them in a film about dragons that looks as raw and gritty as they come and you have me in the front row (well, a few rows back since NO ONE wants to sit in the front row at the movie theater).  Sadly, my cinematic experience was ruined shortly after this preposterous excuse for an action epic began.  Outside of some pretty impressive visual effects (those dragons are breathtakingly real) and an unusually vivacious performance from McConaughey (to say he was best in show actually stings a little), `Reign of Fire' is just a complete and utter mess.  I don't really want to spend all day here, but I will say that the film is incoherent and not very well thought out.  The premise is completely lack luster and filled to the brim with countless holes it's actually kind of embarrassing.  To top it all off, the film is actually somewhat boring.  Maybe that's because it hurts the head to try and pay attention, but I found myself bordering on snores while watching this film.  Please understand, I LIKE SLOW MOVIES, but this just doesn't capture your attention like a film of this nature is supposed to.  It's sad, because this film showed promise.  It's a rare thing for me to say that I wish Michael Bay had directed something, but maybe a little of his tacky humor laced into this brainless film would have made it at least palatably entertaining.  Instead, this film is dead on arrival.  How anyone can give this a five-star rating is just plain baffling.
B002UXRGLG|5.0|Life is sort of a semi-sequel; you might call it, to Planet Earth. Again, it takes you all over the planet looking at various things, but this time instead of focusing on different climates and geographical regions of the Earth, it displays the living creatures that inhabit it. It is also, a condensed version of the 9 \\"Life\\" series by Sir David Attenborough. If you have not seen any of those, this would be a good introduction as it is narrated by David as well.<br /><br />On that note, make sure you pick up this (the BBC) version and not the Discovery Channel title, which was narrated (atrociously) by Oprah Winfrey. In addition to substituting David's narration with Winfrey's, they have also re-written most of the original narration, the music has been redone, and the episode structure has been reformatted to better appeal to \\"an American audience\\". They were able to keep Mr. Attenborough's narration and George Fenton's music intact for the Discovery Channel broadcast of \\"The Blue Planet\\", (which was very successful) but for some reason, they think that Americans will no longer accept this. Why? I don't know. Let's forget about the stupid decisions of the Discovery Channel though, and move on to the program which is spectacular!<br /><br />The episodes are arranged as follows...<br /><br />Disc 1:<br /><br />Challenges of Life<br /><br />Reptiles and Amphibians<br /><br />Mammals<br /><br />Disc 2:<br /><br />Fish<br /><br />Birds<br /><br />Disc 3:<br /><br />Insects<br /><br />Hunters and Hunted<br /><br />Disc 4:<br /><br />Creatures of the Deep<br /><br />Plants<br /><br />Primates<br /><br />From the first sequence you are immediately hooked, while watching from a fantastic aerial viewpoint, a bunch of dolphins corralling a group of fish in a circle of mud. This behavior has been filmed before, but not quite this well before, and this applies to many moments in this series, you may have seen it before, but you'll be seeing it in a new light or from a different point of view. The whole program has a very fresh feel about it; it does not feel like a watered-down retread of previous programs at all.<br /><br />There are also many, many completely new behavioral segments filmed for the first time in this series. The box says 54, and there were definitely at least that many. Over and over, I was saying, \\"Why didn't I know that?\\" and \\"How have I not heard about this before?\\" or \\"What the?!? No way!\\" I have never seen cheetah's hunt an ostrich before, or a pebble toad escape a giant spider, or knew that a mudskipper keeps its young under the mud and has to keep refueling their oxygen supply by gulping in some air, swimming through his underground chamber and  then ex-hailing on the eggs! I could go on, and on.<br /><br />As you would expect from the BBC Natural History unit, the footage is absolutely jaw-dropping and filmed in crystal-clear perfect quality. The close-up footage of chameleons, time-lapse footage of plants, and fantastic aerial views from a lamergheir's eye view are incredible and rich with detail. And I'm only talking about the DVD here; I can only imagine how spectacular the Blu-ray looks!<br /><br />The sound is also full and very clear and there is a perfect balance between narrator and music, David is never drowned out. It's a shame that there will be no soundtrack as there was for \\"The Blue Planet\\" and \\"Planet Earth\\". The music George Fenton composed was as good as ever and I would have loved to hear it separately from the program.<br /><br />Occasionally, sound effects are used that are obviously not natural that I know some people didn't like in past programs such as \\"Blue Planet\\". A good example of this is the Venus Fly-Trap sequence, when a fly's leg hit's a hair-like trigger on the plant and a ticking bomb sound is heard until the plant crunches down. There is even a burp when the plant opens up again, it's subtle but I think they may have gone just a tad bit too far with that one. I think that it can be easily overlooked though, and throughout the series, it's never really very distracting.<br /><br />Again, this program continues the tradition of ending each episode with a 10 minute making-of feature, and I really hope they continue this for a long time to come. In these, \\"Life on Location\\" segments you see how they constructed a 2-year woodland plant-growth time-lapse shot (that only lasts about 45 seconds) and the work that went into it is just mind-blowing. You also get to see how they achieved the shots of monarch butterflies flying high above the ground at their wintering migration site. These are only a couple examples of the lengths that went into the making of this program, and they are easily as fascinating, and incredible as the program itself.<br /><br />Overall, this is a wonderful documentary that I think, lives up to \\"Planet Earth\\" in every way. It's informative, and has some of the most spectacular wildlife imagery ever filmed. Really, with the BBC and David Attenborough on the box, this whole review wasn't even necessary.

0374158460|2.0|To me good literature paints a picture from an artist's perspective and allows the reader to make his or her own conclusions. The first 150 pages of Freedom I really enjoyed, the characters I found interesting, it was clearly well written, and I found myself rooting for Walter and Patty. Then came the Bush-bashing and preaching of liberal ideals. Seriously. For the rest of the novel.<br /><br />It occurred to me about halfway through that the author probably envisions himself the socialist answer to Ayn Rand, but where Rand shows you through plot her view of the world, Franzen just attacks Republicans/Capitalists in a way that came across to me as juvenile. I am not denouncing Franzen's opinions, I just think he could have presented them in a way that would have done a much better service to those opinions. The line that really turned me on this book was comparing \\"the Siamese-twin fundamentalisms of Bush and bin Laden.\\"<br /><br />There is a recurrence in the novel of characters reading or referencing Tolstoy's War and Peace, one of the greatest character development stories I ever read. The only real character development I found in Freedom was the lone republican realizing the \\"evils\\" of his ways. (Anyone who has not read War and Peace but plans to do so will need to watch out, Franzen outlines virtually all of W&P's plot for you.)<br /><br />I wouldn't discourage anyone from reading this novel, I just think it's only fair you know what it is you are getting in to.
0553805371|4.0|I'm a big fan of Stephen Hawking as an entertainer.  He has a great talent for making complicated scientific concepts in an understandable and entertaining manor; in other words, mass market scientific theory.  I watched his short series Into The Universe With Stephen Hawking on Discovery some months back and LOVED it, so I was really excited when I saw this book.<br /><br />The book covers the Theory of Everything, how the universe came into being, and the finer points of quantum physics, no small feat.  Some of the concepts are a little hard to visualize in normal life.  For example, while a soccer ball kicked would travel from point A to point B, quantum particles traveling from point A to point B instead travel every possible path simultaneously.  It gets weirder still when the act of measuring them, even AFTER the particle would have passed the point where it matters, actually changes the end result.  Freaky stuff.  Big items still travel a given direction because most of the varying paths the base particles take cancel each other out, making the path the item takes follow the most likely path.  That's a reoccurring theme of the book, canceling out forces to explain why things work the way they do.<br /><br />The book is accessible to just about anybody.  It includes the very basics of science, such as simple things like what are 2D and 3D, the definition of a circle vs ellipse, light behaving both as a particle and a wave, etc. and builds up to more complicated theories.  It's not a book you're going to want to skim, because you need to grasp at least the general concepts of the earlier chapters to understand the later ones.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed the book, but I'm not even going to pretend I fully comprehend the nuances of all the theories presented.  One problem I had though is that a lot of what is claimed (maybe by necessity) needs to be taken on faith.  He obviously can't show the supporting math in a mass market book like this, but since in many cases particles/actions are theoretical and haven't actually been seen yet, a bit more depth to explaining \\"why\\" some of the concepts should be accepted would have been helpful.  He's generally very good at those types of explanations.<br /><br />Considering what it covers, at less than 200 pages (not counting glossary and index) the book is a little short; I'd have loved to see more detail on the theories of time travel from his TV show to add another chapter or two.  Maybe in his next book.  If your looking for an entertaining book that makes you think, give this one a shot.are theoretical and haven't actually been seen yet, a bit more depth to explaining \\"why\\" some of the concepts should be accepted would have been helpful.

0439023483|4.0|I read the entire book in one night.    Brutal in so many ways, yet without causing damage to the reader, and certainly no dwelling on pain, suffering, or violence just for the sake of it.    Compelling, cool story, solid character development, and well-constructed plot. Not the most original concept for a story, but certainly has enough angles, twists, and depth in and of itself to make for a very worthwhile read. I thoroughly enjoyed the book and enjoyed the pure escapism it offered.
B003QCCS36|5.0|This is a gorgeous album from start to finish. Apparently, he dusted off his old Joni Mitchell and Neil Young records before writing these new tunes, and that is a good thing. Even though influences can be heard, Lamontagne is a true original and the Pariah Dogs are an outstanding backing band. He can rip your heart out and send you foot-stomping to the front porch in the same 15-second span. Well done, Ray. You are the best singer-songwriter of your generation with a special voice and perspective.
B003R0LBVW|1.0|Just as I object to a lurid work of art even though the artist may be technically skillful, i dislike reading novels by writers whose primary purpose is vilifying those with whom they disagree politically.  Is it any wonder our country is so polarized?  Let's stop supporting this childish and destructive behavior and allow our neighbors to hold differing opinions without calling them names.  I also object to the gratuitous and graphic sex in the novel.  Honestly, I found none of the characters likable and am glad to say they are not like anyone I actually know.  this feels like a story written by an overly libidinous adolescent who dislikes himself and everyone else but has a lot of tehnical writing skill.  One hopes he'll find a good teacher, therapist or other mentor to help him deal with his self loathing and direct his talent in more positive directions.  Ability is worthless if used in destructive ways.

They step away from the sound which made them famous from the great Hybrid Theory and Meteora, both best sellers. Change came once the released 'Minutes To Midnight' and with this release I can truly say as a fan I am impressed. LP's use of dynamic instruments and beats make this a worthwhile listen from start to finish. Shinoda's rap verses from 'Wretches and Kings' are to the point where I tag along memorizing all the lines. He does sing a bit more in this album. Chester, one of the greatest vocalists of this time nails every song with his screaming vocals from 'Blackout' to the soft radio friendly 'Iridescent' In the end Linkin Park has released another masterpiece sure to win a future Grammy.
B002KREVE2|5.0|The Isle of Wight concert DVD really adds a lot of meaning and depth compared to the soundtrack alone.  We have all heard those songs, and those exact tracks, but the video brings it to life.  And when you compare Wight to the recent concerts (and if you havent made the physical and financial effort to see at least one of them, then you deserve to, and indeed will,  die in relative misery - compared to the enduring high that the rest of us obtained for our money) ah yes, comparing Wight to recent, you can see that the calm and brilliantly structured current format had its genesis way back then.  For my part I hadnt even noticed how he created that Cohen aura back then, until I saw the Wight video.<br /><br />This is really worth while owning, not just because one should collect every collectable crumb of . . .  whatever one is interested in, but because it will in some small way make your life better.
0066620996|4.0|Whether you're an undergraduate student, an MBA student, a veteran manager, or an investor looking for an edge, Jim Collins \\"Good to Great\\" has something for everyone.  Collins offers a well organized, hierarchical structure of the most successful companies.  Arguably this is a book about business management and leadership.  Using real life examples, Collins details the qualities found in the best CEOs and executives.  As he says often throughout the book, once you get the right people on board the rest usually takes care of itself.  While it isn't a step by step plan for greatness, it does offer some tips and valuable insights (people first THEN strategy).  But even if you're not an executive or aspiring to be one, \\"Good to Great\\" has much to offer.  Investors will find the management discussion useful for fundamental analysis.  Picking a company with strong management is key to investment success.  Collins can help you spot signs of good management and warnings signs of weak management.  If you don't fall into either of these categories, \\"Good to Great\\" is still a great read. The stories, such as the rise of Darwin Smith from a farmer to Harvard Law graduate to CEO of Kimberly Clark, are interesting and inspiring.

B003V5PPZG|5.0|This is one of Linkin Park's best albums. Sure it is way different from HT and Meteora but it is still really damn good. For all the people who hate it and cry for the \\"old linkin park\\", grow up. Linkin Park has always been a band about new sounds and experimenting. If you watch the video on making A Thousand Suns, they even say themselves they never felt comfortable with what people \\"thought\\" should be their sound should be(Nu-metal). Come on if they kept making the same music it would become boring. Anyways, this is one powerful album if you listen to its entirety in order. It shows their talent and make very powerful points. I highly recommend it.

The flaps, rather than being the inset cutout type that would be made from board almost as thick as the pages, are made from a thin cardboard that is glued onto the page.

0060723513|1.0|This is a load of hogwash. A made up tribe, made up wisdom, made up everything. Even if telepathy exists people still THINK in their own language so unless both parties speak the same language it wouldn't work. Even if the telepath worked on a more empathetic line you wouldn't be able to hold conversations, much less any conversation with complex or abstract notions.Australian Aborigines find this not only offensive but important enought that they called for it's destruction.  Some responses-     Sandra Saunders, Director  Aboriginal Legal Rights Movement    Aboriginal people in Central Australia are frequently required to refute erroneous and unauthorised statements made by non-Aboriginal people about aspects of our culture.    A case in point is the book by an United States author, Marlo Morgan, entitled \\"Mutant Message Down Under\\". The central Land Council believes the content of this book to be fabrication. We believe it lacks any credibility whatsoever. Aboriginal people are concerned that they will be subject to further misunderstanding and humbug from people, particularly from overseas, who have accepted the false message being promulgated by Ms Marlo.    Tracker Tilmouth, Director  Central land Council    As a concerned Aboriginal Organisation actively working toward the recognition of Aboriginal Cultures in Australia, the Aboriginal Sobriety Group Inc. Finds this publication to be offensive, degrading and a total insult.    For any person to make the claim of being custodian of all Aboriginal dreaming is a fabrication of the mind. For a non-Aboriginal to make this claim is ridiculous. For a woman to claim to be a custodian and privy to Aboriginal men's business is ludicrous.    The Aboriginal Sobriety Group Inc.

B0041ZQHHA|2.0|After the promise of the single, Crossfire, i was expecting a great album. I am disappointed at how boring this album is on first listen.

B0000DZTIL|4.0|This movie came out in 1985 during the blitz of teen-age comedies that happened in the early and mid 80's. With the exception of Dennis Hopper, the cast is not your typical A list group. But imho, that's what it makes it fun.    We start out with a UFO that crash lands in the 1950's out in the Arizona desert. The government covers it up and 30 years later a high school student finds the engine to the craft and tries to pawn it off as his science project, only to find out that this engine can cause time and space to get mixed up and the high school gets turned into a place full of cave men, gladiators, Vietnam war continuing and even some mutants from the post apocalypse.    John Stockwell is the star who finds the engine. Danielle Von Zerneck plays the love interest and Fisher Stevens steals the show as the wise cracking best friend who can't stay out of trouble. Dennis Hopper is their science teacher who unlocks the mystery of the alien engine and in the end we see Mr. Hopper back from a tour of the 60's and he's wearing the same clothes he wore in Easy Rider!    No skin but plenty of non-politcally correct language which helps make the movie even funnier. If you are easily offended, then this movie is not for you. If you can laugh at yourself and just enjoy the movie for what it is, you'll be pleased. I know I was when I first saw it in 1985 and feel the same way 25 years later.

Suzanne Collins is not an author I had heard of before, but can tell you that I have become a follower. A great read for someone who loves fiction that doesn't go over the edge of reason. Believable. Wonderful!
B003NX6ZDC|5.0|Got an early copy, just before my first Vegas trip. I can see how some Killers fans, on first listen, will be disappointed. It's all over the place, & yeah it does have some country overtones (thankfully).     But I haven't listened to anything else for the last five days. I think he's a maturing songwriter who's branching out into new subjects, especially religion. In \\"Playing With Fire,\\" when he sings, \\"This church of mine may not be recognized by steeple/ But that doesn't mean that I will walk without a God,\\" that knocked me out. Amen, brother.    What I can't figure out is why the best song on the album, \\"The Clock Was Ticking,\\" is a bonus track. It's a witty & sad mini-epic about a high-school sweetheart love affair inspired, I'm guessing, by the death of his mother from cancer. Incidentally, I found \\"Tidal Wave\\" to be the best Killers track ever, and it ended up a bonus track, so I guess some artists don't even know what they've got, sometimes.     My take--it's a bit subtler, & more nuanced, than other Killers albums, but well worth your time. And it's the same voice, rich w/ gorgeous vocal inflections, as always. If you're dead-set on another Hot Fuss, skip it. But you'll be missing out.
078401213X|5.0|Maximillian Cohen (Sean Gullette) was a math prodigy, and lots of people want to get inside his head and exploit him. There is a lady from Wall Street, Marcy Dawson (Pamela Hart), all sweet talk, but she doesn't care about him--just wants to get at what's in his head.<br /><br />-----------------------<br />Maximillian Cohen: I'm trying to understand our world. I don't deal with petty materialists like you.<br />====================<br /><br />The Kaballah scholars aren't much better. Lenny Meyer (Ben Shenkman) tries to befriend him in a coffee shop, but who's to say he wasn't sent by the rabbi to win him over? They are trying to unravel the mystery of the Torah and are searching for a 216 digit number that Max may have discovered. It could be the name of God. Who does Max think he is? If he has the number he was only a vessel with a delivery meant for them. He is unworthy, and isn't pure enough to receive it. That might explain the headaches.<br /><br />-----------------------<br />Maximillian Cohen: It was given to me. It's inside of me. It's changing me.<br />Ephraim: It's killing you, because you are not ready to receive it.<br />====================<br /><br />Sol Robeson (Mark Margolis), another mathematician who was working with Max on a project involving Pi, has good advice to offer him, but he is getting old, and wants to abandon the search. Sol has a Russian accent and though it is never spoken, has number tattoos on his wrist that indicate he may have spent time in prison--perhaps in Siberia? Max grows increasingly paranoid and obsessed with his search. Sol tries to console him, telling him that even Archimedes had to take a bath before he could proclaim \\"Eureka!\\"<br /><br />-----------------------<br />Sol Robeson: This is insanity, Max.<br />Maximillian Cohen: Or maybe it's genius.<br />====================<br /><br />Then there is Jenna (Kristyn Mae-Anne Lao). She has no ulterior motive--no hidden agenda. She is a kid who just likes to play with her calculator and is fascinated by how Max can instantly solve any equation she gives him in his head. At one point Jenna asks Max for the result of the division of 748 by 238. This simplifies to the fraction 22/7, the result is 3.1428 which is a good approximation of pi often taught in primary schools--accurate to three digits.<br /><br />Though Jenna and Sol offer him some solace, he mostly puts his faith in math:<br /><br />-----------------------<br />Maximillian Cohen: 11:15, restate my assumptions:<br />1. Mathematics is the language of nature.<br />2. Everything around us can be represented and understood through numbers.<br />3. If you graph these numbers, patterns emerge.<br />Therefore: There are patterns everywhere in nature.<br />====================<br /><br />On the other hand, the number Max is searching for is 216 digits long. 216 is 6x6x6; 666 is the \\"number of the beast\\" according to the Book of Revelation. The black and white photography, shot high contrast, and Max's headaches, paranoia, and obsession create an atmosphere not unlike David Lynch's Eraserhead, but in this case Max is holding the eraser and standing before a blackboard of feverish calculations. Another film to compare and contrast Pi with is The Number 23,  directed by Joel Schumacher; starring Jim Carrey and Virginia Madsen. Though The Number 23 is quite different than Pi, both films share an obsessive, mystical fascination with numbers.<br /><br />-----------------------<br />Maximillian Cohen: When I was a little kid, my mother told me not to stare into the sun, so when I was six I did...<br />====================<br /><br />13:07, restate my assumptions:<br />1. Darren Aronofsky wrote and directed Pi and then went on to direct The Fountain, Requiem for a Dream, The Wrestler, and Black Swan.<br />2. Pi was shot in black and white on a budget of $60,000, raised mostly from individual contributions from family and friends of $100 each.<br />3. Cohen means priest in Hebrew and most people with this last name could theoretically trace their lineage all the way back to Levi, one of the 12 tribes of Israel. Their similar DNA shows that Cohens are Levites, the priestly cast.<br />4. A large part of what makes Pi a fascinating film is the fascination of numbers themselves. Fractals, the Fibonacci Sequence, the search for a pattern in Pi, patterns in nature, or the stock market... There is even a search by Kaballah scholars for a 216 digit number that could be the name of God, the key to the universe...<br />Therefore: The Bottom Line is that Pi is an intriguing film by a talented director that will be enjoyed by people who like to have their thoughts stimulated while they are being entertained.<br /><br />-----------------------<br />Maximillian Cohen: Something's going on.

1559277734|3.0|I listened to the audiobook narrated by Christopher Timothy.  It was pleasant.  It is partially autobiographical, but primarily fiction.  It was written by a veterinary surgeon who worked in Yorkshire, England, starting in the 1940s.  It is told in the first person and describes the working life of a country vet whose primary patents are large farm animals.  He is sometimes injured by the animals, for example a horse kicking him.  He also tells stories about the owners of the animals.  For anyone interested in becoming a vet, I'd highly recommend this, but it is also entertaining for the rest of us.  This is a period from the past before many drugs and modern treatments were discovered.  I understand more vets today practice on dogs, cats, and other companion animals as opposed to large farm animals.  Film and TV versions of the book are also available.<br /><br />DATA:<br />Copyright: 1972.  Genre: memoirs, veterinary rural practice.

0307271862|1.0|Sorry, folks.  I thought the book was simplistic and comic-bookish.  I kept wondering whether the book was a political statement of Mankell's philosophy or a murder mystery.  I finally concluded it was both...with the result that he wrote neither very well.  The characters are caricatures to the point of silliness.  I neither liked nor hated any of them; I simply didn't much care.  I sometimes had to put the book down in disgust and wait a few days because I didn't find the plot or the characters believable:  the police are stupid, Birgitta is weak and foolish, and the Chinese are all caricatures.  Oh, and the socio-political ramblings seem to come from the mind of a teenager.  I'm disappointed since I haven't read any of his 'Wallander' series and was looking forward to doing so; that urge has passed.

B0041ZQHHA|1.0|This album was a complete disappointment. I LOVE The Killers, and I love Brandon's voice and stage presence, but this litterally is like americana country. If you are into johnny cash, with ambient synth, then you may LOVE this, but if you are looking for something along the lines of the lead single crossfire, you are sadly mistaken looking here. Honestly, I had been waiting for this album for months, but I honestly don't understand how the same guy who wrote \\"all these things that I have done\\", \\"mr. brightside\\", \\"when you were young\\", or \\"why do I keep counting\\", could write something as boring and as lame as \\"On the floor\\". Honestly, save your money! Maybe this will drop to one of those $5 album deals and you can purchase it as a novelty item. Or maybe you should just buy the few tracks you like. But lyrically it's too cheesy, musically it is too boring, and vocally it is too experimental for you to waste your money. THANK GOD The Killers are not breaking up!
B003V5PPZG|2.0|\\"Minutes To Midnight\\" witnessed Linkin Park attempting to morph into some type of amalgam of U2 and Pink Floyd, as they edged their way into adult contemporary with songs like \\"Shadow of the Day\\" and \\"Leave Out All the Rest.\\" For the most part, that was forgiveable, because those songs were well-constructed pop, and the album also featured some songs that were uptempo and reminiscent of their early sound (\\"What I've Done\\" and \\"Bleed It Out.\\")<br /><br />With \\"A Thousand Suns,\\" any trace of old Linkin Park is gone. There are electronic interludes between nearly all of the songs, and they don't really connect the songs, making them almost non-sequiters. Of the 15 tracks, only nine are actual songs, and many of those (such as \\"Catalyst\\") sound more experiments rather than fully developed songs. When the songs do develop, they lack the strength of the better moments of their previous work. \\"Robot Boy\\" sounds like One Republic covering Oasis' \\"Wonderwall.\\"<br /><br />\\"Iridescent\\" picks up melodically where \\"Leave Out All the Rest\\" left off, but never really gets going. \\"Wretches and Kings\\" is a brilliant track, combining all the great elements of MTM with their early hits. But all in all, this album is somewhat of a missed opportunity. It is evident that the band labored extensively on this, as the lyrics tell tales of everything from nuclear fallout to citizen uprisings. It is an ambitious effort to be certain - but it suffers the fate of so many other albums, which is a lack of consistently strong songs.
1567184855|1.0|The \\"case studies\\" in this book sound very fake and made up. They seem limited by Mr. Newton's imagination as appears through the repeated mention of \\"tunnel effect\\" and \\"bright light\\". These images are known very commonly as post-death images in all cultures and don't really convey anything new. Mr. Newton, get some REAL cases and then write a book!!<br /><br />I agree that this is a new area (especially in the western world); but some of the older cultures (e.g. Hindu culture) have a lot of literature on the subject and I wish Mr. Newton would have taken time to go through it (as one has to consider the spiritual aspect along with the physical one). I personally prefer the explaination provided by Swami Vivekananda about 100 years back in one of his lectures in London. That focuses more on the philosophical or spiritual aspect; but still seems much more plausible compared to these \\"case studies\\".
B003XL6EKS|5.0|Flamingo is a good album, I like the vibe to this album. Brandon decided to do a solo album. I like the different sound on Flamingo from previous The Killers albums.

0786956291|4.0|I am an experienced gamer who bought this to get my 10-year old son into gaming.  The box is good for what it does, but more limited than I had hoped.  This is less a starter kit than it is a demo version of the game.  As long as you know that, it can be fun.  Just know that you'll have to buy more books in very short order.<br /><br />There are 2 books in the box.  The Player's Book and the Dungeon Master's Book.  The Player's Book introduces a new player to character creation and the basic rules via a Choose-Your-Own-Adventure style story.  It includes a single-player DM-less adventure.  Another such adventure can be downloaded with the included code.  I recommend getting this adventure as well.  The DM's book consists of two parts.  It has an introductory adventure for 4 level 1 players and it has some more rules.<br /><br />My complaint is that there is no straight-forward list of rules or character classes.  There is also no growth opportunity.  To create a character you have to walk through the story every time.  There is no explanation of character classes.  All of the stats are pre-calculated which is fine--until you pick up a new weapon.  Unless you want to give the DM guide (including the adventure) to the players, there is no rules explanation present.  Worse, there is not enough to base your own adventure on.  There are some monsters, but there is no description of equipment.  There is one paragraph for each class explaining second level, but that is it.<br /><br />I love the introductory material, but I would have wanted to see a 3rd book which explained better how the game worked and gave enough information to carry on a campaign for a while.  I want an equipment list and class stats for several levels--maybe up to level 5.<br /><br />All that said, my son loves the game and has gotten his friend to play as well.

If you like fantasy, this book should please you. 100% worth the purchase. Please Mr. Sanderson, give us volume two soon.
159448385X|5.0|Khaled Hosseini writes in an authentic, intimate manner that earned my trust and then forced me through these experiences hand-in-hand alongside the women who are his main characters. The story is matter-of-fact and embellishes little in the way of dramatic segues or artistic license, yet conveys a tale of intense emotion and unabashed humanity. He forces the reader to not only understand but to deeply sympathize with the plight of these two women and both the beauty and tragedy of hope and love throughout their lives.    The perspective of A Thousand Splendid Suns will be one I'll carry with me for the rest of my life.
B003V5PPZG|5.0|This album is the creative, philosophical and musical apex for the band thus far in their career. The maturity shown is the natural progression of men who have grown up, past the radio-weaned singles, past the teenage angst, past the stereotypical. \\"A Thousand Suns\\" expertly creates an impending sense of mechanical and technological doom facing the human race and then smothers the chaos and the tragedy with love and hope. Where the band goes from here is the question. Once a creative plunge this refreshing and deep has been deftly created, I feel the musicians involved will find it impossible to go back, to retreat into the safety net of radio rock and fan-pleasing clones cookie-cut from a previous album. The progression began with \\"Minutes to Midnight\\" and a new chapter was written with \\"A Thousand Suns\\". Perhaps the next step will take Linkin Park even further up the mountain.     The DVD included in this package is unfortunately very underwhelming. Far too many special effects were used and the runtime was very short. Unlike the DVD included with \\"Minutes to Midnight\\", we never really see the band involved in the creative process for a lengthy period of time. The overall tone of the documentary feels jumbled and cheap with no insight into the musicians we are following. All interesting conflict seen on screen is cut short and leaves far too many questions. A disappointing complimentary item to a superb album.
B002VPE1Z2|4.0|I was unsure of what I wanted to use my case for:  a small digital camera or a hard drive.  I chose to use it for the camera; it fits nicely, and when on vacation it held the USB cord and an extra set of batteries without bulging too much.  It's padded enough for a short fall, but I'm doubtful it would handle something worse without some kind of issue.  I prefer a hard clamshell case for hard drives.
B002JVWR9U|5.0|I have sooo loved this tv show......it has characters that you really feel for.....i've read the books and i personally love the tv series better than the books..if you haven't seen the series you really should try it.....it's AWESOME!!!
0525950079|5.0|Submitted by Stu Redish    Having read Pillars of The Earth a while back I was hesitant to begin the 1000 plus page book. I found Pillars to be a chore because of all the pages spent describing the building of cathedrals of the era . I was pleasantly surprised. I could not put it down. I have read all of Follett's books and I agree with the reviews that say he is at the top of his game. I read 50 plus novels a year and I think it will be a while before I am more impressed than I was with \\"World Without End\\"

0439023513|5.0|Overall, this is a very satisfying ending.  HOWEVER, it is not the page turner that first two books were.  It also cannot stand alone, and you need to have read the first two books to appriciate this one.  In this book Susan Collins chooses to focus on the horror of war and spends a great deal of time dealing with the psychological affects that the games had on the main characters, which can be a bit heavy handed.  Additionally, she tries to make the final \\"game\\" the entire war, with variable sucess.  This gets into the whole \\"modern warfare on TV\\" , propaganda games, and the voyeristic quality that this lends to a real life or death struggle for the individuals. There is even some discussion of psycological torture as well as the needs of the many vs. the needs of the few.  So, the idea is that entire war is now the the final hunger game.  Overall, I will say this is a good conclusion, very satisfying, and she will definently make young people think about the way that populations and situations are manipulated by governments, for both good and bad.
B002ZG981E|4.0|This movie would be best loved by analytically inclined folks who love to `figure out' movies and talk through exactly what (and why) happened. The conversations generated alone would ensure the movie will stick with its audiences for some time and this criteria - that of `stickiness' long after the movie is over - is what makes a good film very good, if not great. Hence, the 4 stars.    Undoubtedly, the dream-worlds the movie brought to the public imagination have been the main focus of discussion. What I'd like to focus on here is how the movie reflects our world itself, starting with a question almost crucial to the entire movie: Why does DiCaprio's totem keep falling in the movie? And how do we understand this in the light of the ending where it (almost) fell but didn't?     I hope the following sheds light not only on our understanding of ourselves and the world we live in but also on the movie itself. So again, why does DiCaprio's totem keep falling in the movie?    Layer #1 (Objectivity)...Because whenever it falls that's the Really Real World he's living in (and in which it keeps falling). As he explained to his female apprentice, the totem is the only thing which can confirm if he's dreaming or not i.e. in the end DiCaprio was NOT in a dream (Nolan was merely being playful by closing off the scene at approximately the moment when the totem would fall) - this seems the most likely (and least problematic) position.     On this view, the totem served as a mark / leftover / reminder of Objective and True reality. We still know that we know something and so we need to hold on.    Layer #2 (Construction)...Because, given the fact that we create our dreams (whilst simultaneously experiencing them), the totem falling was DiCaprio's own doing within his dream. Then again, it could've been a result of his continual (self?)-tormenting due to having spent half a century with his wife in a dream only to awake and have his wife kill herself. But after the final 'therapysession' when he 'dealt with' his (quasi-/un-) dead wife, his dreams then reflected his much improved condition. Summing it up: Subconscious/Wife haunting him = Totem keeps falling. Subconscious/Wife exorcised = Totem spins on and on (as when he meets with Watanabe at the start / after many decades in limbo) - the dreams we have both determine yet depend on the state of our hearts.    On this view, the very symbol of Reality is our own construction and there's simply no way of knowing if we're dreaming or not. The movie provokes us to re-examine what we consider real or not, how we often lose touch with the actual for the virtual, how the virtual 'plants itself' into our lives and the consequences we face as a result. We now know that we do not know something and so we need to keep searching.    Layer #3 (Chaos)...Because the totem, signifying our dreams, have 'taken over' us and has not only blurred our grasp of reality and  dreams but has subverted our very ability to ever find out. Humanity is thus locked in with an intrinsic-yet-external(!!) - a sub-trinsic? - element both inseparable from, yet in full control of, us i.e. our dreams. At least in the previous view, the problem was merely internal in that our ability to decipher reality from dreams has malfunctioned. On this third view, though, our sub-conscious (the deep 'Reality' in our very core) is a malignant force which takes hold of us.    On this perspective, the entire movie was, of course, merely a dream but whose? Who's the dream-agent? Whose were the projections? Instead of us spinning the totem, it was really the totem spinning us. This view fits well with the unpredictability and out-of-control-ness which permeated the movie. In Biblical terms, the dream was like the sea with all its terror and splendor, engulfing Man with deadly (and largely unknowable) force.    The Dream, then, is More Real than Reality itself and we can never stand far back enough. Inception, here, depicts realms beyond our control. We do not know what exactly it is we do not know, and so we need to adapt and fight a way forward in the unknown.    Layer #4 (Obsession)...Most controversially, the answer to the question could be: Because our dreams have taken over us yet this is exactly what we want(!!). Recall DiCaprio's quixotic struggle with his dead-yet-alive wife, how he both truly wants to 'go home' yet at the same time can never get enough of the dreamworld. How, as master architect of the dream landscape, he alone FULLY knows the 'rules' and principles of the dreamworld yet remains 'possessed' somehow by his very own dreams in such a way that he continually (yet willingly and obsessively!) breaks the very boundaries he sets for others.    The movie, on this view, brings us to face to face with a 'cut' in our universe, the site of which is our sub-conscious which - far from being 'hidden' - does in fact manifest itself in powerful ways i.e. it is the heart of our hearts about which we know not, yet from which can be loosed the most intense and terrible of desires. It's us in our most central yet also most inaccessible. It's that which drives us on yet which our rational minds reject; its desire in its purest because what it desires is to keep on desiring. This is what the totem represents: A never-ending fixation which in whatever position, whether spinning or stationary, looks exactly the same.    Our dreams control and create us all, yet they are of our own planting. We are our own demons and angels, unwillingly yet lustfully embracing our self-created destructive and paradisiacal fates.    Inception is not about giving answers (having one's desires fulfilled) nor is it about proposing new questions (having new desires) - it's really about the never-ending act of asking (desiring as an end in itself). Over and over again. At the deepest level of our lives, we do not know what we know and this is precisely what we yearn to keep on (not) knowing.
B003V5PPZG|1.0|Linkin Park returns as emasculated as ever.  This cd is a disgrace.  Linkin Park has become but a shadow of their former selves.  This is electro, techno-pop balladry at it's worst.  There is nothing heavy about this album at all.  You gotta love all of the excuse making by some of the other posters here about how the band has evolved and is getting in touch with their inner feelings.  Utter crap!  These guys have re-invented themselves as a parody of what they once were.  I previewed this album before buying it, which I won't do at this point.  Don't buy this!!!!
0553386816|3.0|When I read the first three stories, I seriously considered finding some way to return the book to the bookstore.  \\"Blood Drive,\\" \\"Fetching Raymond,\\" and \\"Fish Files\\" all have unsatisfactory endings.  A good short story leaves the reader hanging, wanting to know what happens next with the characters, but Grisham pushes his readers over the edge with an abrupt jerk in these three stories.   \\"Blood Drive\\" is about three back-country boys on a joyride and ends with their trip going horribly wrong; \\"Fetching Raymond\\" reminded me of Grisham's novel The Chamber with its tale of a trip to witness a prisoner's execution; and \\"Fish Files\\" deals with the main character's shady methods to skip town with a lot of money.  Grisham chooses interesting setups for all three stories, but he can't complete their assembly.     The last four stories, however, are much better and more reminiscent of Grisham's indelible story-telling style.  \\"Casino,\\" \\"Michael's Room,\\" \\"Quiet Haven,\\" and \\"Funny Boy\\" provide readers with more complete storylines and adequate conclusions.  Of the four, \\"Quiet Haven\\" and \\"Funny Boy\\" piqued my curiosity the most.  I wanted to know more about the main characters in both and found myself shaking my head and smiling by turns.     \\"Quiet Haven,\\" told in first person, recounts the story of a young man who travels various retirement homes and manages to make money by exposing their weaknesses.  Protagonist Gilbert Griffin has the knack for appearing almost blasé, but readers know he is more cunning than he seems.  His internal dialogue makes us want to know how he got started doing what he does and where he might go next.  Gilbert is undoubtedly smart, but there's also a certain element of his personality that makes the reader simultaneously wary and interested.      In \\"Funny Boy\\" a small town is abuzz with the news that one of the rich kids is coming home to die of AIDS.  Adrian Keane is a homosexual and knows the discrimination he will face when he comes backto his home town of Clanton.  But he comes back anyway and enters into what some town members consider a questionable living arrangement.  Adrian doesn't care, however.  He is not ashamed of who he is and how he plans to live his last days, and because he is so accepting of himself he instantly becomes accepting of his caretaker, Dell.  While the story ends predictably, Grisham provides us with some nice moments; he captures the racism that still exists in some parts of the country in a way that is all at once real and yet respectful of the fact that some people believe things differently than others.  This fine balance proves the extent of Grisham's talent and why he is one of the most popular novelists of our time.
0061537969|5.0|I picked this book up way back in June and never really had the time to sit down and read it straight through. It is definitely one of the most lovable tales out there ... way better than \\"Marley and Me.\\" This book sounds kooky at first ... a story told by the dog's point of view. But once I started reading it, I could not stop reading it. It's so relatable and wise and wonderful all wrapped in one novel. It has been quite some time where I can actually enjoy a novel without being impatient for the conclusion. The writing style is concise, smart, funny and filled with wisdom that only a dog can portray.    I like pets but a lot of times, I find stories told from an animal's point of view to be pithy and sometimes, predictable. Not this time. This one really rocks ... and Enzo is a dog that I will never forget. How can I? He's a wise soul wrapped in a furry body, unable to help his friend (pet is not the right word) Denny through his biggest mishap in life, other than to be there. Perhaps that is the greatest lesson one can gleam from this book.     Enzo is a race car dog as well though he has only ridden in a fast car once but he has never forgotten it ... Two barks means faster, Denny. Denny leaves the tv on for Enzo while he's at work and Enzo learns so much and has his favorite actors all lined up and with justifiable reasons to back it up. How can anyone not like this dog? I think he's cool.    This book will be a fast read because it's set in a conversational tone ... there is no self-consciousness about this dog and there is no conceit either. He just tells it as he sees it and wonders why we humans just don't get it.    This is one of my favorite reads of the year ... and definitely a book club choice as well!    9/14/10
B003SWNRU2|5.0|German heavy metal legends Accept have dedicated their new album Blood Of The Nations to members of all the armed forces who fight to protect our freedoms, but that picture on the cover could well be blood from the ears of those of us who have listened to it!  Accept are back, and man are they back in a big way, delivering a full on sonic assault the likes of which heavy metal has not witnessed for many, many years, and which the genre has sorely missed. This is surely their best album at least since Russian Roulette in 1986, and possibly the best album of their career thus far.<br /><br />Blood Of The Nations really is a blast from start to finish with well thought out musical arrangements and Wolf's solos are particularly impressive over Herman's power riffing (I love the guitar tone of these guys!), plus Schwarzmann gives us a smashing exhibition of drumming.  Then there's buzz saw like lead vocals, gang vocals, heavy but clear bass and it's all mixed to perfection by Andy Sneap.  Highlights for me include:<br />Track 2 Teutonic Terror - Classic retro metal yet sounding fresh at the same time, some classic metal lyrical phrases and ultra cool bass work in the intro (terrific film clip too!)<br />Track 3 The Abyss - heavy riffs, some real high pitched screaming and a great contrasting melodic refrain that works perfectly with the lyrical theme.<br />Track 5 Shades Of Death - Power riffing to make Metallica fans cream their pants (note: Metallica credit Accept as a major influence on them).<br />Track 7 Time Machine - Classic Accept base line with the perfect blend of beat, power & melody.  Would be a shame to get this album without this bonus track, it's a killer.<br />Track 8 Kill The Pain - An excellent slower and quite melodic song with Wolf's majestic solos all through it, sounding very much like a German version of the blues.<br />Track 10 Pandemic - As you would expect, it's about metal in the blood, spreading \\"like a metal disease\\", with a great riff and beat.<br />Track 11 New World Coming - A melodic, mid paced rocker with riffs that sound a lot like the classic Accept songs from their peak in the early to mid 1980's that all us fans love.<br /><br />There are also the faster, frenetic songs that kick you right in the face in the typically Accept way and make you realize why these guys are widely credited as being a pioneer of speed metal.  Blood Of The Nations has all you could want in an Accept album, with the only weak point (perhaps) being that track 12 No Shelter is probably not as strong as the other songs.  But then instead of finishing with a ballad as is often the trend these days, Accept finish with a blast of aggression and attitude in track 13 Bucket Full Of Hate.<br /><br />There will no doubt be those who say that it's not the same without Udo, and that is true.  But unlike the failed experiment in 1988 with David Reece on vocals, Tornillo is perfectly suited to Accept's style of music.  He is able to wail like a banshee with a buzz saw for a voice just as well as (if not better than?) Udo, plus he brings a new dimension to the band with his ability to sing the more commercial and melodic moments just as well as he can scream.<br /><br />Clearly the guys are invigorated and excited about what they have done and with what the future holds for them, and so they should be.  This album is a massive slab of pure heavy metal.  This is music to wilt your wife's flowers, scare your children and kill the old folks who live next door.  This is what heavy metal is all about.- A melodic, mid paced rocker with riffs that sound a lot like the classic Accept songs from their peak in the early to mid 1980's that all us fans love.    There are also the faster, frenetic songs that kick you right in the face in the typically Accept way and make you realize why these guys are widely credited as being a pioneer of speed metal.

0525423842|1.0|I had never read a John Grisham novel before THEODORE BOONE: KID LAWYER. But, since it seemed like everyone I knew had read at least one of his books and enjoyed it, I thought I would give his first young adult novel a chance. I wish I hadn't done it. I tried to enjoy the book, I really did, but in the end, Grisham really just let me down.<br /><br />On the jacket, the story sounded great. Amazing even: a huge murder trial. And it seems as though the only person who knows the truth is Theodore Boone, a local kid who dreams of being a lawyer someday. But today just might be his lucky day because he has to show Honorable Judge Gantry that he does know who really murdered that lady. But there's something holding him back -- there are people who would love to see Theo silenced. Forever.<br /><br />** SPOILER WARNING -- (not that there's much to be spoiled) **<br /><br />Based on what seemed like it could be good, I dived in. And I kept waiting for something to happen. Anything even. And it wasn't even until page 109 when Theo actually becomes involved in the plot. It turns out that an acquaintance of Theo's has a cousin who was at the golf course when the murder took place in the up-scale Waverly Creek neighborhood. And this cousin saw the murder go down. Only problem is that said cousin happens to be an illegal immigrant, and if he goes to the police with the truth, he might be deported. Theo soon becomes obsessed over whether to say anything about these facts to anyone. And it soon goes beyond overboard with his worry. There is never any physical danger to Theo, or this cousin, and by the time the book starts to wrap up, still nothing significant has really happened. The idea of an illegal immigrant knowing important information but unable to give it is definitely a good one, but it had virtually no direct bearing on Theo's life. There just wasn't enough of a threat hanging over Theo to hang an entire plot around.<br /><br />Even with the ominous and ever-present villain, Omar Cheepe -- a hired man who does dirty work for the nightlife of the city -- nothing happens. There is plenty of foreshadowing that something might happen -- that Theo might get hurt -- that this cousin might be found out -- but nothing ever does happen. It almost felt like I spent the whole novel waiting and waiting, and by the time I reached the end, I couldn't wait to be done.<br /><br />** END SPOILER WARNING **<br /><br />One other thing that really bothered me about the whole book were the characters themselves. It seemed like everyone had been cut out from cardboard -- Theo was a goody-two shoes kid, who never did anything wrong. Mr. Mount was the typical mentor / teacher to Theo, who for some reason called all of the boys in his class, \\"Men.\\" The parents felt like they were barely there and barely involved at all, and of course there was the estranged Uncle Ike, gruff and off-putting at first, but willing to help later on. I never really felt like I connected with anybody, and to be honest, Theo never experienced any sort of character development. He's pretty much the same kid we meet at the beginning and the same kid who exits the book.<br /><br />The writing was not bad itself. Grisham definitely knows how to turn out good sentences and paragraphs and even describe the judicial system without being boring at all. But at times, I felt like I could have had more fun reading a text book on law written by Grisham instead of this poorly conceived young adult novel. I was half-curious if Grisham has been reading anything current in the young adult / children's market. Because he sounds highly out of touch with this generation and the way they interact and think.<br /><br />All said, I'm not ready to dismiss Grisham as an author. I would love to read one of his novels that has a good plot twist and well-thought out characters.

B001ILFUDM|5.0|I'm SO glad Disney is going through their classics and making the transfer to bluray. I love the story, characters, music, among many other things. Everyone should have this classic as part of their collection.
1400049628|5.0|This was actually the first book I bought to introduce me to the wonderful world of zombies. After only a few pages of reading, I was hooked!! It is the ultimate tomb of knowledge when it comes to battling the undead. I read some of the reviews from those few who only rated this book 1 star and they just don't get it. The book is *meant* to be taken seriously because the Zombie Apocalypse IS coming soon. Well, maybe not, but I really hope it is. And when it does happen, all those nay-sayers will rue the day they thought poorly of this book. LOL!<br /><br />Seriously though, this is an excellent read and very well written. If you are any type of zombie fan, this book MUST be added to your collection. Then once you finish reading it, you must next buy Max's book \\"[[ASIN:0307346617 World War Z: An Oral History of the Zombie War]]\\". It is another MUST HAVE zombie book! :-)
B001EOQWFI|5.0|yet another WONDERFUL effort by the people at Pixar. This time going back to basics with a film ran mainly on images, music and feeling rather than full of dialogue. Although this might be a daunting idea to parents, children will be fully amazed at how attached they will be to Wall-E and how well they will understand what is going on in his world. Adults and children alike will enjoy this film, as well as its message.
B0036EH3U2|5.0|If your a fan of the movie then this is a great buy.  i bought from amazon when it dropped in price.  Not much to say then its a great buy and everything about is 5 STARS (Picture, audio, Extras).....
B003XKPPOU|5.0|I went to see this film knowing that I will be taking a trip down memory lane. I was about Andy's age when the first film came out and now that i'm older... I felt just the same. The last scene in the movie definitely brought tears to my eyes for I knew exactly what this boy felt.   I highly recommend this film to all those that still hold on to their inner child and wish to share it with their children.
B000PWQPAC|5.0|Kôkaku kidôtai: Stand Alone Complex- Solid State Society. It has been two years since the end of 2nd Gig, when \\"Major\\" Motoko Kusanagi left Section 9, a Special Forces unit assigned to cyber crime and answerable only to the Prime Minister of Japan in 2034. Family man Togusa is now leading a much larger force. Chief Aramaki has visibly aged in the job, walking painfully with a cane and attended by Proto. Batou has become a brooding, depressed commander of the training school. All wonder if the Major will ever return. This time around our heroes must deal with the seemingly unconnected rash of suicides, mass child abductions, conspiracy involving elderly healthcare, a \\"Wizard Class\\" hacker called the Puppeteer, and as always, corporate malfeasance and political wrangling. All tidied up with a terrific subtle \\"what if?\\" ending. At $3.2 million SSS is one of the most expensive TV movie anime's yet, and all the money is up on the screen. Illuminating the convoluted storyline are: Increased detail in both background and foreground (missing in 2nd Gig). \\"Busy\\" scenes found only in big budget movies. Naturally smooth movement by people and machines. Small touches like the Nissan concept cars, wrinkled clothing, reflections and small lighting effects, raindrops, \\"Handheld\\" camera angles, etc. There are plenty of \\"remember this?\\" scenes and other touchstones from the series, including great music by Yoko Kanno, with Origa singing the opening and closing songs. Motoko's face is even cuter than ever and the rest of her- you just don't mess with perfection. GITS: SAC is not for anime fans looking for scantily dressed little girls, giant robots or magical swordplay. Its story lines, dialogue and multiple overlapping themes are more suited to readers of William Gibson's \\"Neuromancer\\" or P. K. Dick's \\"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\\" So if you prefer the new \\"Battlestar Galactica\\" instead of \\"War of the Worlds\\", GITS:SAC-SSS might just be for you.
B003VQM2ME|4.0|Nock Cave had gotten in quite a rut over the years. After the great first albums with the Birthday Party, he became quite the post/punk posterboy with his Bad Seeds records. While these were great in the beginning, one cannot contest that he got quite into repeating himself over the last decade or even more. His albums had become really predictable, which was mda worse by his status as a new/wave poet. Indeed, pretentiousness was quickly or slowly killing the music. The first Grinderman record was OK, not more but this one is great and it shows that he has not forgotten to rock and is still able to deliver musically. A great surprise.
B00003CXB4|4.0|I ordered this expecting it would come with cover and in original DVD case. Shocked when I opened the package and saw it was a black DVD case with only the first of the two Lion King DVD's inside. I guess I should have read the description before I bought it. Plugged the movie in and it worked well... a few scratches here and there. Fast shipping so that was a plus.
B002JVWRAO|5.0|Anyone who has seen the final episode of this season, \\"Swan Song,\\" recognizes the quote in this review's headline, which is destined to be Castiel's new catch phrase. I thought this was a really good season, and they provided a mostly satisfying ending to the original 5-year storyline. There were some parts I thought could have been better, but the good parts far outnumber the not-so-good. I'll hit the good parts first. --WARNING-- spoilers from here on in the rest of this review! If you haven't seen it, then you should probably stop reading... NOW.<br />The good: Lucifer was very menacing, even when he was trying to act nice and play a poor victim. Seeing Ash again, in Heaven, was awesome. Ellen and Jo's death was very well done. I like the addition of Crowley, as well as the antagonism between Dean and Zachariah. I think they did a great job with some episodes that could have been really stupid and cheesy, but they pulled it off. For example, the future episode was good, and the \\"Supernatural convention\\" episode was even better. I loved the tv series episode, where Sam was forced to do a genital herpes commercial, and Dean avoided getting nailed in the crotch on a Japanese game show. I really felt it when Dean lost all hope after their trip to Heaven, and he and Sam were basically told to buzz off by God himself. I liked all of the Horsemen, especially Death; his one scene in the Chicago pizza joint was epic! Did you notice in that scene, even Dean, Mr. smart mouth, is wise enough.. or terrified enough? ...not to give Death the smart alec routine. I liked the twist of the trickster turning out to be an archangel, and the brother of Lucifer. The plots had their usual excellent twists and surprises that I have come to expect from this show. It's pretty useless trying to out-guess the writers on this show, just enjoy the ride.<br />The bad: I don't think we saw Lucifer enough, especially early in the season. I don't like seeing Sam and Dean at each other's throats all the time; I hope in the 6th season they patch things up again. I respect the decision to put Bobby in a wheel chair; it drove home the point that hunting is dangerous and has consequences, but I still think it felt a little forced. I do disagree with the move to make Castiel a weakened shadow of his former self. They managed to get some decent \\"angel discovering humanity\\" laughs out of it, but there was no real reason for Castiel to be impotent and nearly useless. What happened to the anti-Christ kid? He had one episode and then he was just gone. Speaking of Christ, where was Jesus in all of this? They tapped just about everyone else in the bible, but no Jesus? Also, I can't help but feel that the ending was watered down a little from what it would have been if there had been no 6th season. Would they really have ended the series with Sam trapped in Hell, sharing a cage with Lucifer and Michael, while Dean was suicidally depressed on Earth? I don't think so.<br />So for season 6, I have a lot of hopes and expectations. I hope that the brothers will become a team again, and stop whining about their angst to each other. I want to see more of the creative unpredictability that we have gotten used to. I hope to see Sam and Dean learn to balance a somewhat normal life along with hunting, so that they can enjoy life while hunting. Other hunters do it, so why not Sam and Dean? They don't need to be so black-and-white, 'any attachments are a weakness' outlook.<br />As for the DVD extras, be sure to watch some of the bonus features they have.. all I will say is that they are downright scary, more than the show itself. And there was a Ghostfacers episode, which was fun too. Can't wait for season 6!ime; I hope in the 6th season they patch things up again. I respect the decision to put Bobby in a wheel chair; it drove home the point that hunting is dangerous and has consequences, but I still think it felt a little forced. I do disagree with the move to make Castiel a weakened shadow of his former self. They managed to get some decent \\"angel discovering humanity\\" laughs out of it, but there was no real reason for Castiel to be impotent and nearly useless. What happened to the anti-Christ kid? He had one episode and then he was just gone. Speaking of Christ, where was Jesus in all of this? They tapped just about everyone else in the bible, but no Jesus? Also, I can't help but feel that the ending was watered down a little from what it would have been if there had been no 6th season.

B000A3XYZA|5.0|«Rodelinda, Regina di Longobardi»(1725)by Georg Friedrich Händel has some of the most beautiful arias from this outstanding composer. It´s delightful to watch and listen to Andreas Scholl as the King Bertarido: his arias «Dove sei, amato bene», «Scacciata dal suo nido» and «Vivi tiranno» are prooves of the greatness of this excellent countertenor. About the ambiance of the opera it remind us a little the times of the nazis in Germany, perhaps, because of the costumes worn by the singers. Artur Stefanowicz as Unulfo has three moving arias in the opera, but-without doubt- the last one, «Un zeffiro spiró» yields a charming sound sui generis. Kurt Streit as Grimoaldo sings one of the most romantic arias that I have heard: «Prigionera, l´alma in pena», which he speaks about the sacrifice of the freedom in exchange of a no reciprocal love; in this case the love of the Queen Rodelinda. Anna Caterina Antonacci, in the role of Rodelinda is full of vigour; her aria «Morrai, sí», against the tyrant Garibaldo is diametrically opposed to the tender roles for the haendelian prime donne. Louise Winter as Eduige represents a sensual role. She is veri good in the recitatives, too. Umberto Chiummo as Garibaldo is outstanding; his aria «Tirannia gli diede il regno» is the best performance of wickedness that I have seen in a opera by Händel. I recommend this DVD! It´s superb
B0002DB52M|4.0|If you have not seen this movie, STOP READING NOW, for real, because this movie has the best surprise ending I have seen in a while. So understand that if you read on, I'm not responsible for blowing the ending.<br />Ok, so I watched this movie in a political studies class at my university. At first, I hated.. HATED the minimalist set. I was thinking to myself, oh man, I hope the whole movie is not like this. I was waiting for buildings to start appearing one by one. Nope. Not happening. The whole movie looks like a high school play production. I was fuming about that for quite a while. To me, when I watch a movie, I pay attention to the set, because it provides a lot of context for the movie. It really helps set the scene, which is why it's called the SET. Take that away, and sometimes it just looks silly, like when actors are trying to turn invisible doorknobs on doors that are plainly not there.<br />Then the plot started picking up, and I was able to forget about the lack of a proper set. The main character of the story, Grace, tries to fit in to a small town, works hard for all the townspeople, and in return she is taken advantage of by everyone in the town. It starts with petty jealousy, then overwork, then she is threatened, has her belongings smashed, her money stolen, then rape, then she's chained up and raped repeatedly by just about every male in the town. She tries to to escape and is betrayed. When the townspeople call in her gangster father, hoping for a reward, she settles her differences with her father and uses his power. I was afraid for a minute she was going to cower away, leaving the townspeople unpunished. Instead, she orders her father's gangsters to set fire to the town and shoot every man, woman and child with their tommy guns. At that point I was laughing and clapping my hands, as was everyone else in my class. Then she corrects the gangsters to \\"shoot the kids in front of the mother, then shoot her.\\" HA! I wanted to give Grace a high five at that point.<br />Later on, I remembered that I had always wondered what could have possessed German troops in WWII to liquidate entire villages in Eastern Europe, and here I was laughing and clapping at images of it happening here in the USA. But Grace had been so wronged, for so long, in so many ways, and those townspeople were so irredeemably wicked, they deserved exactly what they got. I think that is one of the lessons of this movie, that if properly motivated, any person, anywhere is capable of deadly actions.<br />As for accusations that this is anti-American, I don't think so. It was set in the USA, but it could have happened anywhere. I didn't perceive anything that made this situation as a commentary on American culture, but on humanity in general. And I'm a dedicated Republican saying this. Usually I am sensitive to anti-American propaganda in movies and on tv, but I think this movie's criticisms go beyond just the United States.t point.

B003NWS5AO|5.0|Instead of earning millions more and being part of a classic rock stadium act, Robert Plant has moved in a whole other direction that is haunting, beautiful, uplifting and magic in its exploration of various roots in music.  I applaud his vision and am blown away how much I like this on the heels of another outstanding tour and album with Alison Krauss.  I hope I get a chance to see the Band of Joy tour.  This album made me want to listen to Patty Grifffin, Buddy Miller and Los Lobos as well.  His singing and the musicianship blows everything out of the water for me.  There was a little twinge a couple years ago in me that thought about seeing Led zeppelin (or3/4 Zep) live but...no more. Congratulations to Mr. Plant on redefining himself and making a great cd.  Addendum Orchestra Foxwoods woohoo...show of the decade for me
B003PIUC02|5.0|Yeah, the show's harsh and hard to watch if you're even the least bit squeamish.  The gore is sometimes over the top and they don't hold back on sex scenes.  And to be honest the scenery (all those nearly-naked men fighting each other) and the photographic style probably got my attention, but probably the biggest part of the show that appeals to me is the satisfying, well-motivated character development and the intense story lines that never leave loose threads hanging.      The focus the story has gives show a sort of elegance that I really admire.  When TV tells a good story, it's very good and it's thanks to the beautifully structured stories and well-motivated characters that had made the series extremely satisfying.    Yet, if there is such a thing as writing to the death, sine missione (no quarter given, no mercy shown), then this is it.       Show Creator and Head Writer (Show Runner) Steven S. DeKnight has delivered what is possibly the best TV show I've ever seen and has shown me what TV really could be.  If beloved characters need to die in order to move the story forward, he doesn't hold back.  That's rare in TV where I think so many times writers and producers tend to be far more cautious.  A writer should be willing to do anything in order to tell the most effective story he or she can and this is exactly how this show is written: show no fear and take no prisoners and write like it is a battle fought to the death.    I would love this show for that alone, the fearlessness of the writing.  Yet there is more to love, especially in the person who plays Spartacus, star Andy Whitfield...     He's perfect as Spartacus, he gives the character a sense of humanity even in a time when few people were humane. He's noble, but deadly, fierce and passionate too and Andy portrays all sides of Spartacus flawlessly.    The other actors, almost without exception (there are a few missteps here and there) are all as committed to this show and willing to do whatever it takes to tell the best story they can.  They all give wonderfully complex and passionate performances.  Lucy Lawless and John Hannah are particularly a joy to watch.    The graphic style is amazing.  It's beautifully filmed, especially with the way the shots are designed to look like graphic novel panels.  The sets and costumes are equally as gorgeous.    Take a look at this show, if you haven't already, if only because it's one of a kind.  Starz's tagline for it as `A bold new original series unlike anything on television' is probably the understatement of the century.    \\"Spartacus: Blood and Sand\\" is possibly my favorite show.  I can't wait for the Blu-Ray to arrive so I can see the whole thing all over again, and again, and again.
B00006JSS8|4.0|For the casual Stevie Wonder fan who doesn't want to buy multiple CD's, this is a very strong compilation - the best available on a single disk (in fact, better than the two-disk \\"Song Review: A Greatest Hits Collection\\" as well).  It's impossible to capture all the big hits in 80 minutes, but The Definitive Collection comes close.  Still, there are few things that could have been done better:    * Obviously, there are technological limits when it comes to cleaning up early-60's recordings, but the sound quality of the early tracks is definitely mediocre.    * \\"Hey Love\\" was just a minor hit, and really doesn't belong here.  Likewise, they made the odd choice of including the 7:23 minute album version of \\"Living for the City\\" rather than the 3:41 single edit (which is far superior, IMO).  With those two changes (saving 2:43 from \\"Hey Love\\" plus 3:42 from \\"Living for the City\\" = 6:25), they could have added: \\"If You Really Love Me\\" [US#8, R&B#4](3:00) and \\"Isn't She Lovely\\" [hugely popular, but never released as a single](3:18; radio edit), or \\"Go Home\\" [US#10, R&B#2](5:18).    * The liner notes are OK, but nothing special.
B001AQO3WY|1.0|I am sorry but I cannot agree with all the \\"wonderful and awesome\\" reviews this movie has received here.  I thought it made the American soldiers look like \\"idiots\\".  The characters were so \\"dumbed down\\" it was pathetic and the language was atrocious. I dont know why film makers these days have to fill the movies with garbage.  My husband and I watched about 1/2 of the first disk and then took the movie out and threw it to the side.  A week or so later, we decided maybe we didnt give it a fair chance and my husband watched the whole movie.  He said it never got better. I guess we were just expecting a movie like you see on World War II or something.  I know there were many heroes in this war too but it made them look like poor stupid little \\"drop out kids\\" where the military was maybe the only chance they had in life.  To me peeing and trying to write USA in the sand with their pee and comparing their size etc was not funny.  For those of you that claim you served, I feel sorry if you feel this movie did you honors!!!!
0131103628|4.0|The C Programming Language is a classic text within the realm of computer science and, if programming languages were religions, this would be C's holy book. Within the community of hardcore, bearded C hackers, the book is known simply as \\"K&R.\\" In fact, if you follow the coding guidelines in the text, your C code is said to be \\"K&R style.\\" The guidelines for the Linux kernel even go so far as to say \\"if it's good enough for K&R, it's good enough for us.\\"<br /><br />It's important to note that the original incarnation of this text is more than 30 years old, written before the era of personal computers, more than a decade prior to Microsoft Windows! With that in mind, this book is a must have for any individual serious about hacking on Unix-like systems. I use what I have learned from this text on a daily basis when developing on Linux, OSX, and FreeBSD.<br /><br />However, individuals with a background only in Microsoft Windows will find this text significantly less useful than those on Unix-like systems. Most programs mentioned in the book are provided by default on Linux distributions, but simply cannot run on Microsoft Windows. If you only use Microsoft Windows, you would almost certainly be better served purchasing a book geared towards the Windows development platform.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the high quality of the material in this book is not reflected in the text's typesetting. Things you take for granted in modern documentation, like examples with syntax highlighting, are not present in The C Programming Language. The text is also significantly less crisp than modern offerings and it can, at times, be difficult to distinguish between characters.<br /><br />While this book is definitely worth it for anyone interested in Unix-like systems, it's definitely beginning to show it's age. The text is also not geared towards beginners, so amateur programmers may be happier with a more introductory text.
B003V5PPZG|1.0|I just listened to the copy that my friend bought of this and i am glad i did not waste my money on this. This is by far not the Linkin Park that we all grew to love. This is a completely different sound and myself and 4 others all found this to be a hurtful experience to listen to. If you never listened to LP in the past and don't have any expectations you might think this album isn't complete waste of time and money.

B003NX6ZDC|3.0|Even when Brandon Flowers makes mistakes on \\"Flamingo,\\" his intriguing solo debut, they are extremely interesting mistakes.<br /><br />With his quivering yet authoritative vocals - reminiscent, in an unusual way, of the late, wonderful Roy Orbison's - he charges through this selection of unique, quirky, often quite touching set of modern, urbane singer-songwriter pop with aplomb and conviction.<br /><br />Proponents of Ryan Adams could credibly postulate that Flowers is perhaps taking some of Adams' artistic eccentricities and sprucing them up for a more palatable audience, but nonetheless...<br /><br />Lead single \\"Crossfire\\" has earned critical repute and deserves far more radio success than it has thus far achieved. The poetic, effervescent lyrics and hopelessly scintillating (and purely catchy) chorus make the song an instant hit. Other potential hits exist in \\"Hard Enough,\\" a gorgeous, lyrically eloquent mid-tempo ballad co-written and co-performed with Jenny Lewis, whose expressive voice gels extremely well with Flowers'. The cathartic, prayerful \\"On the Floor\\" sounds as weightless as it does profoundly beautiful.<br /><br />There are many intriguing misfires (perhaps `misfires' is too harsh a word) on the album as well. The bubbly, perky, 80s-styled \\"Was It Something I Said?\\" sounds like guttural Americana and retro bubble gum at the same time, but, much like the overlong, cliched \\"Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas,\\" it takes a long time to not quite catch its groove, sounding more like a very interesting idea for a song than a finished one.<br /><br />Even the promising \\"Jilted Lovers and Broken Hearts\\" is sprawling and in need of restraint, despite its urgent production and excellent display of Flowers' vocal range. It has a common problem for the record - Flowers' excesses as a song writer have not been reigned in. The songs are often overlong and in need of more focus. Perhaps this has to do with his going it alone without his Killers bandmates. Perhaps this has to do with Island Records giving him creative carte blanche for the project. Perhaps both.<br /><br />Even Tolstoy needed an editor.<br /><br />The more forgettable material is still well-oiled due to Flowers' compelling, driving vocals and fine production work from Daniel Lanois, Brendan O'Brien and Stuart Price.<br /><br />\\"Flamingo\\" may not be an artistic triumph, but it is nothing to sneer at, either. Flowers is a quirky, brooding, highly inventive young artist, and while he is reminiscent of other performers (it is difficult not to be) he has a distinct sound of his own, even irrespective of the Killers, that he is beginning to hone quite well. It is a hell of a lot more interesting to hear an artist stumble a bit trying for something real and original than simply doing what has come before, and Flowers fulfills that desire. He is worth far more than a passing glance.<br /><br />(The bonus tracks were clearly left off the album for a reason - from the folksy, beat-poetry-like \\"The Clock Was Tickin'\\" and the atmospheric, pillow-padded, downbeat \\"Jacksonville,\\" these tunes would have diffused the atmosphere of the standard album were they included on it.
