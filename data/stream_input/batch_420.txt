B000005JA8|5.0|This is by far one of the greatest albums ever made.  Whoever argues or has a different opinion is wrong.  There's no such thing as a different opinion than mine when the subject is this album.  Seeing by the other ratings I see 1 individual disagrees.  Now, he is true in saying Zappa is more talented,and sure, maybe even &quot;better&quot; I will not lie.  But this album is one of greatness that should be heard by all.  Seeing that everyone else who voted agrees, I think you should buy this and cherrish it.  Buy Frank Zappa's &quot;Hot Rats&quot; or &quot;Grand Wazoo&quot; as well.
B00014NE62|5.0|There is no need to repeat the praise others here have heaped upon MAURICE and the DVD package. This is the way any film of quality should be treated.<br />For those who will surely find it entertaining, there's a very nice EASTER EGG on this DVD:<br />Go to Disc Two--select Deleted Scenes, page 2--select &quot;May I ask you name?&quot; and then right-arrow. A small icon will appear in the lower right hand corner of your screen. Click on that and enjoy  a hidden deleted scene.
B0000BYM3K|5.0|What can I say about Iron Maiden that hasn't been said already? They rule! And their new album is no exception. <br />Wildest Dreams-Nothing really catchy here. Good guitar work, but the melody just falls flat. 3/5<br />Rainmaker-Awesome song! Interesting lyrics, and a great melody to boot. Definitely listen to this song. 5/5<br />No More Lies-A slower song, so I guess that's why it's not one of my favorites. Still, it has some nice lyrics, and heavy. 3/5<br />Montsegur-HEAVY! Great chorus to. Bruce never ceases to amaze me with his range and ability to deliver a dead-on preformance. The melody on this song is also excellent. 5/5<br />Dance of Death-Killer song, although I think it might have been better without having \\"pranced\\" in there, but hey, who cares if the rest of the song is amazing? I especially like the fast paced part at the end, where Bruce things along with the melody-\\"When you're lying in your sleep, when you're lying in your bed, do you wake from your dreams to go dancing with the dead?\\" 5/5<br />Gates of Tommorrow-Cool song. Not my favorite, still good though. 4/5<br />New Frontier-Another killer song! Has some nice riffs, and the lyrics are reminiscent of an old horror movie. 5/5<br />Paschendale-AWESOME!! Epic right here! About the WWI battle at Paschendale, this song starts with a slow tapping, then the guitar comes in with a sort of melancholy tune. This doesn't last long, though, as after a while the song kicks into full gear with ass kicking riffs and rhythms! 6/5<br />Face in the Sand-Sounds a bit like the title track, but I'm not saying it's bad by any means! The guitars work nicely here to deliver a heart pounding assault. 5/5<br />Age Of Innocence-A cool song. Kick-ass riff, and also pounding drums make this track a must listen. 5/5<br />Journeyman-A slower song, which is probably why I don't like it too much. Still worth a listen, though. 3/5<br />What can I say? Maiden has certainly put out another masterpiece. And, hopefully, there willbe many more to come.<br />Up the Irons!
0800177975|3.0|After MUCH deliberation, this was deemed an appropriate DVD to watch - after turning down all my other suggestions. And it turned out to be quite good!<br />This was filmed before Austin O'Brien became truly cringeworthy, with a god-awful haircut in My Girl 2. He's exactly the same here, and there were times I wanted to take a pair of scissors to his hair! (I've just seen a more recent photo, and he looks totally different!)<br />Last Action Hero has an almost Willy Wonka quality to it. There was a golden ticket that Charlie Bucket had to find and Danny Mannigan also had to find one - or actually got handed it. I was so waiting for Oompa Loompa's to come out! Now that would have been cool.<br />The whole story climaxes in Arnie being brought out of the movie, and getting to see the 'real' world, which is a very interesting concept, as it could be seen as we're not the ones in control. (I totally believe that) So his whole life was one big lie, and controlled by someone else - not the big man upstairs, but a film director. Arnie basically takes the p*ss out of his whole on screen persona in this, including lots of his trademark sayings, including: \\"I'll be back!\\", \\"Trust me\\" and \\"Do it\\". There's also a very funny scene where Jack Slater meets Arnold Schwarzeneggar - make sense of that!<br />Also look out for a whole host of cameos in this movie - ones which are easy, to spot, some which aren't! Some of these include: Chevy Chase, MC Hammer, Sharon Stone, Little Richard, Maria Shriver, Robert Patrick, and Jean-Claude Van Damme!<br />There are some great lines in this. Some of these are:<br />Danny Madigan: You think you are funny, don't you?<br />Jack Slater: I know I am. I'm the famous comedian Arnold Braunschweiger.<br />Danny Madigan: Schwarzenegger!<br />Jack Slater: Gesundheit.<br />Jack Slater: Kid! Who does the doctor treat?<br />Danny Madigan: Patients?<br />Jack Slater: Look at the elbow of my jacket. What is it doing?<br />Danny Madigan: Wearing thin?<br />Jack Slater: Bingo!<br />Benedict: Gentlemen. Since you are about to die anyway, I may as well tell you the entire plot. Think of villains Jack. You want Dracula? Dra-cool-la? Hang on<br />[takes out the ticket]<br />Benedict: , I'll fetch him. Dracula? Huh. I can get King Kong! We'll have a nightmare with Freddy Krueger, have a surprize party for Adolf Hitler, Hannibal Lecter can do the catering, and then we'll have christening for Rosemary's Baby! All I have to do is snap my fingers and they'll be here. They're lining up to get here, and do you know why Jack? Should I tell you why? Hmm? Because here, in this world, the bad guys can win!<br />So if you're not keen on Austin O'Brien, see how many celebrities you can spot, and how much Arnie acts up in this movie!

0738206679|5.0|I first heard the author speak on NPR.  Not only was I enthralled with his intelligence and clarity of thought, I was captivated by the promise of a new perspective on the connectedness of all things, from the sizes of stars in a galaxy to the revolution in internet search engines to the biology of the cell.  This book delivers on that promise with insight, wit and style.
B000063UR1|4.0|On an overtechnologized and defoliated Earth of the future, the ecosystem has been carelessly destroyed by humans and the only remaining wilderness environs are grudgingly looked after by astronauts on massive domed spaceships.  The vitamins, minerals, and such required to sustain human life can be easily synthesized in laboratories, so the folks on Earth are becoming increasingly apathetic about the need to sustain the circumgyrating greenhouses.  When the inevitable order to scrap the project and destroy the orbiting flora and fauna finally comes through, Freeman Lowell (Bruce Dern), the only astronaut in the project who truly cares about the plants and animals, violently rebels and places upon himself the responsibility of protecting the last vestiges of Earth's non-human life.  But just how far will he go to ensure that he's successful in his self-imposed calling?<br />1972's SILENT RUNNING marks the directorial debut of FX wizard Douglas Trumbull, probably best known for his FX work on Stanley Kubrick's 1968 sci-fi epic 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY.  Though the skeleton was given flesh by writers Deric Washburn , Michael Cimino, and Steven Bochco, the underlying structure of the plot is Trumbull's.  In light of his work with Kubrick, it is interesting that Trumbull would come up with an idea such as that for SILENT RUNNING, as it makes it seem as if he felt that the only way he could demonstrate that he is more than just an FX man was to create a film that is the thematic opposite of the one featuring his best known FX work.  Kubrik's opus tells a story that celebrates mankind's intellectual evolution and subsequent technological advancements, whereas Trumbull's brainchild embraces the ideals of 1960's counter-culture ecology movement and implies that technological advancement is conducted irresponsibly and consequently pollutes the environment and wrecks the Earth.<br />The plot of SILENT RUNNING is a bit slow at times, but the film is never dull or boring. And in the role of the good-intentioned but increasingly psychotic Lowell, Dern turns in one of his most intense and most memorable performances.  Due to its anti-technology and pro-environmentalist theme, however, many critics have panned SILENT RUNNING as a '60s throwback in which Trumbull tries to milk emotions from the last vestiges of the pro-ecology hippies, often citing the fact that '60s folk singer Joan Baez performs some of the film's music as proof of their theory.  But this is really an unfair evaluation.  Environmentalist themes have been a long tradition in science fiction, with a future dystopia used to illustrate what might happen if present society continues being ecologically apathetic.  And SILENT RUNNING isn't the only classic SF film from the '70s built around such a theme.  Other SF films of the era also express concern about man's effect on nature--NO BLADE OF GRASS (1970), Z.P.G. (1972), SOYLENT GREEN (1973), and PROPHECY (1979) to name just a few.  So it's more likely that Trumbull, a science-fiction fan himself, simply chose a traditional SF theme that appealed to his own ideals and tastes.<br />The DVD from Universal offers a good digital transfer of the film in anamorphic widescreen.  Also included are some pretty cool bonus features, not the least of which are the original made-for-tv featurette on the making of the film and an interesting feature commentary with Trumbull and Dern.  No true fans of SF will want to miss the opportunity to include this film in their DVD collections.e role of the good-intentioned but increasingly psychotic Lowell, Dern turns in one of his most intense and most memorable performances.

B00005UKE0|5.0|&quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; captures George Harrison at his creative peak. When recording this album, he was coming off the success of the Beatles' &quot;Abbey Road,&quot; and decided to continue on with the same bright and bold sound. This record is loaded with obscure gems such as &quot;&quot;If Not For You,&quot; &quot;Beware of the Darkness,&quot; and &quot;Apple Scruffs,&quot; that are as catchy as the hits from this record (&quot;What is Life&quot; and &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot;). To top it off, this remastered version includes George re-working several of the tracks from &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; only a year or two before his death in 2001. This album can hold its own against many of the Beatles' records and stands above any other Beatle solo album. George recorded several quality albums (see &quot;Cloud Nine&quot; and &quot;Brainwashed&quot;), but this is the cream of the crop. It's the real deal.

B00003CXCT|3.0|George Lucas seems to have really lost all touch with fans and reality. First he reworked the original brilliant star wars movies and released special editions, which were not any better (most consider worse) than the original versions. This was (obviously) a way to make a bunch of money, and get everyone excited for the prequels. We've had the (dis)pleasure of seeing the first two prequels, and boy were they disappointing. Ok, maybe they're a little better than your average hollywood garbage action movies, but not much. These movies prove that Lucas has lost his touch, although the second did improve slightly over the first. In my opinion, by taking such a long hiatus from making movies, Lucas has lost all sense for the artform (although he seems to remember how to pawn star wars junk off on the public). It's a sad and repeated tale- the young artist makes great art, gets rich and famous, loses touch with reality, and gets sucked into making more money instead of making good art. I'm not saying that Lucas is totally worthless, but at this point comparing him to any great directors is like comparing McDonalds to a fine gourmet restaurant, it just ain't gonna happen.<br />Now on to this DVD set, which will come out in the fall. My main grievance is like most others, the special editions are lame. It would have been so easy to include both the special edition and regular original edition, one on each side of the DVD. The technology of DVD makes something like that very easy and would make so much sense. But of course if we had a desire for Lucas to make sense we would probably be driven insane. For instance- how could it take so damn long to release some of the biggest American movies ever on to DVD? Meanwhile, every third rate low budget movie has been released on DVD, and the big trilogy (which has hundreds of millions of hugely loyal fans) isn't released until more than 5 years after DVD has been declared the new standard. Well that makes lots of sense, doesn't it?No, of course it doesn't, it's completely ludicrous. Maybe it took five years to transfer the film using new super slow technology, or maybe they had to completely refilm the original versions with new A-list hollywood actors (Justin Timberlake as Luke Skywalker), because of course that was what Lucas originally intended. Or maybe Lucas has just gone utterly mad (and lost any sense of what is good and bad in this world). Considering the amount of money Lucas will make (and considering that seems to be his main motivation these days) i'm totally confused as to why it took so long to release. But to only release the pathetically extended lame editions is truly an act of a mad man. Lucas- don't you get it, we always loved the original versions, they were the best and still are the best. I wish they would just release the original editions so we could all be happy. But try this on for a scenario- Lucas will release the originals a year or two after these to make even more money, you can count on it. Any artistic integrity Lucas may have had is now transformed into corporate money making schemes and merchandising operations. I absolutely love both the original Star Wars trilogy and DVD technology, but i'm tempted to boycott this DVD on my own moral grounds. Well, at least i have my VHS version of the original classics.

B0000AFQS0|5.0|It took far to long for The Kids Are Alright to get out on DVD.  After seeing and hearing the new special edition, it was worth the wait!  Keith Moon has to be seen to be believed.  The extended A Quick One really shows how amazing and entertaining he could be.  The Ox Cam on the 2nd disc is a fitting tribute to the man who held the band together, but is rarely seen compared to his more flashy band-mates.  This is a great package with great content and should be required in every home where music is played.  Just don't smash your TV when it's over.
0385336810|4.0|Even though it isn't as good as the shopaholic series...<br />Emma Corrigan finaly has her chance to shine, but the meeting she attends turns out to be a disaster. On top of that (and the vodka and chamapgne she'd been drinking), during an especially bumpy plane ride she exposes all her secrets to a handsome American stranger that happens to be sitting next to her on the plane.<br />As it turns out, the hunk is not a stranger, but rather the owner of Panther Cola (where Emma works), who turns out at the office the next morning, and seems to remember every tiny little detail of what Emma told him. And he also seems determined to act on that knowledge, and make a mess out of Emma's life. Or is it a mess?<br />Even though Emma isn't Becky Bloomwood, this is still a good read. The only thing I didn't like were the too - many plot twists at the end of the book.
1400034779|5.0|Along with 14 other ladies I have read the series of Number one Lady's Detective Agency by Alexander McCall Smith, as a book club.  We read one for each month for the span of 5 months.  All of us love the books.  The humour as well as the charming use of english in the books, telling the stories, we love it all.  These days, we sit wishing that Mr. McCall Smith is writting as fast as we read.  The writer is so good in writting that we could see the pictures of Botswena and all the characters in our minds as we read and talk about each book.  Certainly this is a series of mystry novels written in a very friendly and entertaining way.

B00004BZ16|2.0|When I think back on the first time I heard this album, I remember saying to myself, &quot;That's it. It's truly over. Punk, Clash, everything is gone&quot;. This gruesome, indulgent, unnecessary and plain awful album was the nail in the Clash's coffin, as far as I was concerned. Somewhere in all these tracks is a decent e.p., if you remember those. &quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot;, &quot;Washington Bullets&quot;, &quot;The Call Up&quot; are okay tunes. If I could find three or four others, maybe there would be an e.p. On the other hand, just looking back at the songlist on this album is depressing me over 20 years later.
0156027321|1.0|I want to preface this review by saying that the factor that most of the negative reviews I've seen have cited wasn't an issue for me. I was not bothered by the excessive gore, although I did think it was just that: excessive. Why would I bother to complain about that when there are so many larger problems?<br />Frankly, the first part would have been where I stopped reading if this hadn't been a class assignment. The huge amount of time that the narrator spent defending zoos was my first indication that this wasn't going to be a fun read. It's not a matter of a difference of opinion -- I agree with him, actually -- but the tone was so ridiculously defensive and condescending that it was difficult to read. Martel was obviously expecting people to disagree with him and felt the need to cut dissenters off before they could argue. The end result sounds like a speech one might expect to hear at a formal debate, only with less respect for the listeners' intelligence.<br />The book just falls apart further from there. While Pi's resourcefulness in his attempts to survive provided some interesting moments of ingenuity, they didn't serve to lighten the tedium the rest of the story fell into. Yes, I imagine it is pretty boring being trapped on a lifeboat for so long, but deliberately mimicking that doesn't inspire any sympathy in the reader.<br />The island highlights the book's greatest failure: it tries to be absurdist in an effort to become allegorical, but never quite makes it. It cannot accept its own internal logic, and constantly makes self-references to how odd and strange everything is. The end result is not unlike a teenager shouting, &quot;Look at me! I'm a rebel! I don't care what anyone thinks! Aren't I great?!&quot;<br />But, as other reviews have noted, it's at the end that the book truly falls apart. Pi denies the whole story he's already told us in order to point out that stories are important, because everything is in how we perceive it and nothing is really real until we say it is. If the book had actually gotten to the absurdist level it so desperately strove for, this might have worked. As it stands, the &quot;moral&quot; boils down to nothing more insightful than, &quot;Dude, what if the whole world was, like, really a computer program?&quot;<br />Yes, that's how dramatically this book fails: I watched &quot;The Matrix&quot; purely for the oooh-pretty special effects, and I can make a better argument for it as a philosophical masterpiece than &quot;Life of Pi.&quot;
B00003CXD5|5.0|The Treasure of the Sierra Madre is a classic movie that has to be watched by movie fans.  Set in Mexico in 1926, the movie tells the story of two down and out Americans who have nothing to their name except their meager salaries.  The two men, Dobbs and Curtin, decide to team up with a weathered, old prospector, Howard, to go prospecting for gold in the mountains of southern Mexico.  Soon enough, the trio happens upon a mountain just full of gold waiting to be found.  What follows is a condmenation of human greed and want of unlimited wealth and riches.  The three men become suspicious of each other immediately, thinking that the other two might steal their share of the gold.  At the same time, the three must deal with bandits who will stop at nothing to get their possessions.  The ending does provide for a brief message of hope.  Everything from the cinematography to the acting to the writing is great in this movie.  Movie fans everywhere should see this classic movie.<br />  Humphrey Bogart gives an excellent performance as Fred C. Dobbs, a wayward American who believes that the power of gold would never make him change his ways and beliefs.  Watching Dobbs morph into a money hungry, paranoid man is frightening.  Walter Huston, father of director John Huston, plays Howard, the grizzled old prospector who is the only calm one in the group.  Tim Holt stars as Bob Curtin, Dobbs' partner and the moral leader of the trio.  The movie also stars Bruce Bennett, Barton MacLane, Alfonso Bedoya, and Manuel Donde.  Also look for a brief appearance from John Huston as a well-to-do American who gives Dobbs some money for a meal.  The 2-Disc Special Edition offers a ton of great extras.  If you're a fan of this classic movie, you will love these extras.  For a classic movie, ranked #30 in the AFI Top 100, with great performances, an excellent script, and beautiful scenery, check out The Treasure of the Sierra Madre!
B0000C8AV2|4.0|I was scanning more recent Dylan tunes for a birthday gift of a long time Dylan fan - who only had the early days on disc.  I found Oliver Neale's Amazon review &quot;Like a brother&quot; - and it intriqued me enough to buy.  This CD is just great.  Bluesy, intimate songs, with a bit of a kick.

B0001NBMBC|5.0|People are going around and complaing about this cd, saying that it isnt slipknot and that they have lost all musical talent that they once had. They couldnt be more wrong, duality has brought out what slipknot truely is.... a bunch of crazy masked men who have more musical skill than any other metal band out there. The drumming carries this masterpeice to perfection and in addition to the awesome percussion, Front man Corey taylor has truly showed his inner self. He has brought out the singing that he shows passion in, the singing that he found upon making music with his other band, stone sour. Not only did all 9 of them gain musical talent, they have all decided upon a breed of metal that they all love. What most people dont know is that Corey taylor said that Slipknot was on the verge of breaking up. The reason he said, was that they all had their different styles and they couldnt please everyone. But much to my pleasure, they were all pleased with the outcome of volume 3 and Corey has announced that he was dumb to think of breaknig up and that slipknot will stay together for all of us maggots to worship. So go out and buy this cd because it truly is what slipknot is and if you are any type of fan, you have to hear the masterpeice wich is slipknot! P.S. Im seeing them for first time on aug. 2nd, i want to know what theyre like at normal concerts (not there crazy ones that they make special for dvds) so post a forum on their performances

6304712944|2.0|This is a magnificent musical. It SHOULD HAVE been made with Julie Andrews, Richard Harris and Robert Goulet. Vanessa Redgrave looks wonderful, but her character seems depressed most of the time and the woman can't sing a note to save her life. Franco Nero was handsome, but looks Italian, not English... fortunately they found a very English voice to dub his songs. The other problem with this film, which bothered me when I first saw it was that it has the most cardboard looking stage sets for some scenes I have ever seen, and worse, the cameras move about exposing the painted backdrops even more. I do believe in the late 60s when this movie came out they had cameras that could be transported to real locations. My hope is that this beautiful musical will eventually be re-made with a SINGING cast using real outdoor locations.... please!!
B00003CXCT|1.0|The Prequels already reek.  Add more CGI to those and release them.  Why not release the original Trilogy as the masterpieces they were?  I will not be buying this.  I am saddened that so many will put up with this nonsense and buy them anyway.
0790749815|5.0|This is arguably Cary Grants best film. Couple that with a terrific cast, dynamite story, immortal one-liners, some great scenes in actual locations, and classic Hitchcock editing and you have a shoe-in on any &quot;best of all time list&quot;. This movie was made in 1958 and although it was current in it's day, it now is just as current as a period film set in 1958, keeping in mind of the political climate and cold war attitudes of the time. The costumes are very natural, having been bought in actual New York stores, and the set designs are beautifully designed. The set decoration is also first rate. <br />This DVD is a superb transfer. The color looks perfectly natural, the sound is full, low noise stereo and the widescreen is anamorphic. There is hardly any flaw in the print. Amazing. The menu is also animated to match the Saul Bass opening title and is wonderful. The &quot;making of&quot; film (30 minutes long) is superb and hosted by beautiful leading lady &quot;Eve Marie Saint&quot;. <br />Finally, the score by Bernard Hermann adds to the high tension of the action. The orchestration and performance on this film is one of the very best of all time. I can't recommend this film enough for action, solid story and terrific action besides just being completely entertaining.
B00003CXCT|1.0|I have upgraded all my essential movies from VHS to DVD.  I wish I could do that with my Star Wars trilogy, but this is not it.  These are the \\"Special Editions\\" and not the original far superior films.<br />I have no desire to own the Star Wars butchered edition movies!
B0001VTPWM|5.0|Some of the reviews of this film are superb and will tell you why this original directors cut of Robocop is so terrific. The Anamorphic Widescreen is clear, crisp and the sound is perfectly surround. <br />Robocop 2 is great and satisfying and has great action and truly horrid bad guys.<br />Robocop 3 is sappy and silly... but it's fun to see as a curiosity just the same... but the real treasure here are the first 2 films and the lush packaging and extras. This is well worth the price. LOVED IT!
B00005JLEX|5.0|Every Generation had its great comedy series, from Milton Berle, to Lucy, to the Dick Van Dyke show, to Taxi (my favorite, out in Oct), to Seinfeld.

B000002UUX|5.0|This CD is great.  Unfortunately DeathbySodomy or whatever his name is doesn't seem to think so.  <br />   It would be really funny to see that kid talk to Dave Mustain like in the way that he referred to him.  Mustain would rip of his scrotal sack and turn it into a fashionable hairnet.<br />   Mustain is one of the few people that actually had a hard life.  He doesn't just claim to have.  This kid thinks he is all funny and tough but I bet he could be broken down so easily.  Unlike Mustain who would just get in your face if you tried to braek him down emotionally.<br />   I like Mustain's lyrics.  He is one of the more cerebral writers out there.  He doesn't have that great of a voice but he makes up for it in his ability to write and play music.
B0001ME5L2|1.0|why do u people by stuff like this?! its totally trash! good for nothing! why do u wnat to listen to some idiot complain about some boyfriend on a cd? and swear too? if you want to listen to good music try jessica simpson's ''sweet kisses'', stacie orrico's ''genuine'', zoegirl's ''life'', and any of racheal lampa's cd's.
B00005JMFQ|3.0|This romantic comedy, featuring an array of the best of British actors and actresses, is very well-made and clever in many places.  I would love to show it to my whole family, but that's not possible. It contains a number of romantic subplots - some heartwarming, some humorous, some poignant - interleaved with what can only be characterized as pornography.<br />The movie honestly troubles me.  I want to watch it with my wife.  Yet, while I know she'd love 90% of it, that 10% which would be completely offensive spoils the whole thing.  If I could convey one message to the producer and director, it would be:  what good is it to make a romantic comedy that couples can't watch in each others' company?<br />I have to recommend the movie.  It's got many good storylines, and a lot of excellent acting.  Sixty seconds of additional editing, and it would have been absolutely exquisite. But don't watch it until you've reread the above paragraphs and concluded that you're broadminded enough to tolerate the tasteless parts.
B000006TRV|5.0|this is one of the greatest albums ever made and as said by earlier reviewers even five stars are not enough to rate this classic album.highly recommended.
B00008NG5V|5.0|Jack present wisely how minimalist music can be extraordinary.
B00005JLSE|4.0|&quot;Chicago&quot; will not fail to dazzle you with superb set design, costuming and choreography.  While not a mind-blowing completely-over-the-top extravaganza like &quot;Moulin Rouge,&quot; this is definitely a spectacle.  It appears to have been lifted quite faithfully from stage, which is unusual for a movie musical, and I would imagine the live show would be something to see!<br />The performances are top-notch, with Catherine Zeta-Jones and Lucy Liu (honest!) really stealing the show.  But there's not a bad performance in this film; even a supporting actor like Taye Diggs does a great job with the 30 seconds and handful of lines he has.<br />The downside of this movie is that it is not a &quot;book&quot; musical, to quote the director &amp; writer from the commentary track.  In a book musical, the songs advance the story.  Instead, this is a musical in which the songs comment on the story as it advances, in an attempt to analogize the lives of our main characters with a vaudeville show (again, from the commentary track).  The downside is that this approach causes the movie to really drag in parts, especially toward the beginning.  This becomes a problem because there is so much singing in this movie.  If the songs aren't advancing the story, the story just grinds to a halt for 3-6 minutes until another dollop of narrative is ladled out.  Another peeve of mine was the tap dance number by Gere, performed in counterpoint to his questioning of a witness.  It's a bit too obvious and belabored.  However, I cannot fault the songs or the dance choreography at all.<br />As far as the DVD goes, the extras are somewhat limited: you get a commentary track, a deleted song, and a &quot;making of&quot; featurette, and that's it.  On the plus side, there is a DTS audio track if you like that sort of thing, and the video and sound are top-notch.<br />This is an enjoyable film that is at least worth a rent.
0385335482|5.0|The first installment of the Rebecca Bloomwood story is a fantastic light read for just about anyone, unless you're expecting a highly regarded literary piece. This simple story is full of comical mishaps and relationship blunders that many of us can relate too.<br />Sure, I could point out that some of the characters are underdeveloped and some of the plot lines could have been drawn out, but this isn't the kind of book that deserves that kind of nitpicking. It's a simple book that doesn't require much thinking and memorizing and flipping back to the first chapter just to keep up with the story.<br />At any rate, this is a good, quick read. If you're looking for a serious read, I don't suggest this. But if you're a shopaholic who daydreams about winning the lottery and meeting the man of your dreams, this book will suit you just fine.

B000002L99|4.0|When listening to Van Halen's 7th album,but first with Hagar,it just kills me thinking about how much of a masterpiece this could have been if Dave was still on board!Good enough and summer nights would sound so much better!Ughh!But anyways,this album is pretty good,even if you're a fan of Diamond Dave.Sammy offers a different layer to the music,not like or as good as Dave did,but it definitely works.Fan's of old school VH will love air-guitaring to Eddie's fret-tastic riffs on tracks like Good Enough,Get Up,Summer Nights,5150,and Best Of Both Worlds.Tracks like Love Walks In,Dreams,and Why Can't This Be Love shows the band exploring new ground with synthesizers and keyboards.None what some expected from a band that used to say &quot;Ain't Talkin' Bout Love!&quot;.But as much of a guitar god as we see Eddie,he has always proclaimed that he's about music,not just the guitars.Whatever he's good at,he'll play.I would have to say Eddie's genius is a big part of what propelled this band from the start.And it's evident because fans still bought records after Dave left.But hey,it's only rock and roll,and if you love rock and roll,especially by the VH bros,then this is one album you should have.Despite Roth's absense,keyboards and synths,and sammy hagar,5150 still rocks.
B000005J08|5.0|this is the album that really got me seriously into jazz. I'll wait a minute to let you gasp....<br />Now, let me explain myself. I bought Naked City in the summer before my freshman year in High School. My father, a former professional, now part-time jazz trombonist played jazz around the house 24/7 and I enjoyed it but didn't really listen to it that much myself. I went to several summer camps focused on jazz improv and I tended to be pretty decent without really listening to the music. The music that I did listen to was hardcore punk rock. The kind where the more bands you know that no one else did, the cooler you are (ever heard of Demon System 13, INDK...yeah thats right). I was a lot more open-minded than others who listen to that music but I still didn't care too much about other music. <br />Then I listened to Naked City and I was blown away. Someone had bridged the gap between jazz in all of its forms and hardcore. This was some scary s---! All of a sudden I started buying jazz cds like crazy and I have never looked back since. Thanks John for making me an open-minded listener and allowing me to be an individual!
B00005JMFQ|5.0|Am amazing movie. It's difficult to explain how good it is. The story lines are interesting, funny, well acted and in large part unpredictable. The recent spate of negative reviews are quite interesting-- all of these reviewers seem to have forgotten that this is a COMEDY. It is not a drama. Are some of the characters unrealistic? Absolutely, because it makes it a funnier story. Who really wants to see a movie about the people next door and their problems? Apparently these recent reviewers want exactly that. <br /> <br />And yes there is some nudity in this movie and some humor about pornography (and even some jokes about using drugs), so if that type of stuff offends you, just don't watch the movie. <br /> <br />Way better than 4 Weddings and a Funeral.
B000002HPV|5.0|Dear Ms. Guðmundsdóttir,<br />I'm sure that the chances of you ever browsing through the reviews of your own albums on a site like Amazon are greater than finding Paris Hilton's disseration on Nietzsche. However, I am still writing this &quot;review&quot; to you. <BR>First off, I would like to give you an apology. I am so, so, so sorry that during my 16 years on this planet I had never listened to you until now. It has been less than 18 hours since I purchased Homogenic and, without exaggerating, I have listened to it at least 10 times straight through. This is the type of album where every listen, a new suprise unfolds in the structure of the music. The lyrics on Homogenic, rank up there with albums such as Astral Weeks or Ok Computer. The usage of the Icelandic String Octet in your pieces gives the album even more of a dream-like feel to it. I must admit Ms. Guðmundsdóttir that this is the type of album that will withstand the test of time and shall open doors to listeners for years to come.
B000002TQB|2.0|I bought this album having only heard &quot;Girls and Boys&quot;, which I think is a great song, and was immediately displeased with the rest on the album. The song appears to me to be ground breaking in its time and very catchy. The rest of the album is basically full of bombs - filler around the first track and its title track, &quot;Parklife&quot;. Most songs are just a lot of sounds basically that have no substance to form a quality song. The others just aren't as catchy or pleasing as the first and fourth track on the album. For those that like it: well it's not my cup of tea but you are entitled to your opinions. If you really like and want to hear Girls and Boys and Parklife, just download them somewhere or buy the single... don't waste your money on the album.
B00001SIES|5.0|This is a somewhat difficult review to write at this moment. I am trying to remember the emotions and feelings that I felt when I first heard this CD, and really had no clue who Muse was. I first heard of Muse through the KROQ (an LA radio station) new music CD that featured Muscle Museum. The rest of that CD wasn't incredible, but from the opening notes of Muscle Museum, I knew I was on to something. I immediately bought the import CD from Amazon and was just blown away with what I heard. <br />The CD begins with a little piano intro to Sunburn, a song that really shows the musical talent of these young men. The seemless transition between piano and distored guitars is really something to behold. Muscle Museum follows, followed by Fillip, not one of my favorite songs, but again, a beautiful interweaving piano line. Falling Down, Cave and Showbiz are very nice songs (Cave especially), but the next song, Unintended is really the hit song of this album. The first time I heard this song, it brought tears to my eyes, there is so much emotion and complexity to this song, I actually called my brother while listening to this song the first time and told him to by this CD. The lyrics are just stunning, the orchestration and development of the song is just, breathtaking for lack of a better word. <br />Uno follows Unintended, and while this song definitely is a little bit harsher (&quot;this means nothing to me, cause you mean nothing to me&quot;) it still is an excellent song. The CD winds up with some hits (Escape) and some misses (Overdue), but even this misses aren't that far off.<br />As I sit here and review this CD some five years after I first heard of Muse, I'm amazed at how far they've come musically with their albums that followed Showbiz, but also how mature these gentleman were for being 17 or so when this was recorded. Everyone who likes Radiohead or similar bands should give these guys a shot, truly a masterpiece.
0807205583|5.0|Lirael was a wonderful book, I couldn't put it down and i read it twice.Lirael is about a teen who isnt gifted with the ability to see into the future like the rest of the daughters of the Clayr.She wants to commit suicide, but then is given another chance to be a librairian. There she finds many thing sabout herself and discovers some magical objects that help her in a journey. She is called by the Clayr and is told that they Saw she would be somewhere, but it was far away, so she begins a journey to get to that place, and an this lon gjourney she meets some very important friends, and learns more about herself than ever seemed  possible. It has awesome action and suspense, great twists,the characters are awesome, and I could go on and on about how wonderful it was. I Couldn't wait to read the sequel, which I did and it was great too.And I read the one before it, Sabriel. Garth Nix is a great author, I became a fan of his when a friend of mine recomended the Seventh Tower series. I recomend Lirael to any fantasy lover, or any book lover for that matter. Definitely a rewarding read.
B00003CX5P|3.0|This movie gets a lot of criticism and I understand why: Childish humor, the annoying Jar Jar Binks, and the prevalence of dull dialoque among some not so great actors (e.g., Nathalie Portman (even though she's not bad to look at!), Captain Panaka (why did Lucas even consider him! etc) and even some good actors (Liam Neeson & Ewan McGregor).  Despite all that, I think the movie is a fun, fast-paced film that introduces a lot of the aspects that will occur in the sequels.  The special effects are notable, but are overwhelming at times.  I like the new advancements, but not to the point where the film cannot mesh with the original trilogy.  Contrary to many, I think the pod race would have been better if it were shorter.  The film definately excels more in the FX department than in the substance department, but really that's what the sequels are for....This film serves to grab your attention and introduce you to the Star Wars universe.  Many criticize the plot, but I found the plot no less developed than other SW films.  Aside from some of the criticisms, I really appreciate the new different look to the film with more colors, grandiose vistas and flowing designs, and really find the subtle references to future films really thoughtful.  Although the film is not as good as the originals (which part of me would rather that it not be as good), the movie is entertaining, fun to watch and definately worthy of the Star Wars title......
B0001UL7RY|1.0|A lot of people here are writing one star reviews because they think Avril is a poser and what not. I'm not one of them. I really liked her first album and after hearing her second single &quot;Happy Ending&quot; I thought the album would be decent enough. And I was very wrong! The only 100% enjoyable song on the album is &quot;Happy Ending&quot;, and the only other good song is &quot;Together&quot;. The rest of UNDER MY SKIN falls in the gray area between Pop/Rock and Straight-up-Rock, and the results aren't very easy on the ears. There are two reasons why this album fails. The melody is not catchy at all. I guess Avril thought that in order to have a harder sound to have to give up all your catchy melody. So since you don't have a catchy beat to get caught in your head, then your left to ponder the careless, stupid, and unprovactive lyrics. It seems that if the lyrics rhymed, then that meant they were good. Because the lyrics rhyme really well, but they are stupid and combined with the bad melody it makes for a very poor album. Avril was trying for a harder sound, this album clearly shows that she should stick with her Pop/Rock roots because her music is just better in that genre. Bottom Line: Get LET GO instead.

B0001ZX0PG|5.0|This is the best movie ive seen in awhile BUT when i first heard of this movie i was thinking this wudd probably be another one of those boring no action just talk movies but it sHOWS SOO MUCH AND im only 14 years old and i can say THIS movie SHOWS FRIENDShip,heartache,evrything. The three main characters were best friends as kids but  one day david got abducted and thsi evetn haunts them all to this day.first im going to tell a lil bit about each of the characters remeber this is 30 years later.<BR>JIMMY- (sean penn) he is the local tough guy he knows the right people and usually no one messes with him.but now he has cooled down and owns a drug store  he has a wife and a 19 year old daughter. DAVID- (tim robbins)he is still a little uneasy and is still not the same since the tragedy that happened 30 yeaRS ago he has a beautiful wife Celeste and a 9 year old son.                                                          Sean- (kevin bacon )he is a detective with the police and has a wife taht never talks to him. and he is a cool guy but hes not friends with david.

0792844882|2.0|Showgirls is the most entertaining, (un-intentionally) funny movie I have ever seen. From beggining to end, it is filled with cheesy scenes, bad acting, and hilarious dialouge that will have you rolling on the floor!\\"Showgirls\\" tries to be sexy, but completely fails. The film is crap, thats why I only gave it two stars,one because it has good production values, and the other just because it honestly isn't worth just one star. But it get five out of five in being entertaining and laugh-out-loud funny!
B00005JMUA|4.0|If you are going to buy this with the mentality that it has as much action as the first film, then be warned. Kill Bill Vol. 2 has nowhere near the action that Vol. 1 had, and Tarantino decided to take a more \\"story mode\\" approach to end this series. We go deeper into the past of The Bride and Bill and get a better understanding of their relationship. The only real action sequences here is her fight with Elle and her training with Pai Mai, other than that don't expect a whole lot. You may be wondering why I left out Budd and Bill, but I will not ruin the surpises. However, with the lack of action in this movie, Tarantino goes so deep into the story that you kind of figure that you don't need all of the action that was contained in Vol 1. You also find out what The Bride's real name is (actually, if you look real close in Vol. 1 you can spot it, but you have to look fast!) but this is the first time you actually get to hear it. The ending was a little dissapointing as you would expect more out of the final \\"boss\\" fight, but it was surprising to say the least.
B00005S6K8|1.0|This is a simply awful remake of the 1950s original with Audrey Hepburn, Humphrey Bogart and William Holden. Their roles are reprised by Julia Ormond, Harrison Ford and Greg Kinnear.<br />Of the three leads, Greg Kinnear (David Larrabee) does the best job. I think he is a very underrated actor, especially after his excellent work in &quot;As Good As It Gets&quot;. He even slightly resembles a young William Holden.<br />Harrison Ford does an adequate but uninspired job as Linus. Actually both Ford and Bogart were both too at least 20 years old to play Linus, who is supposed to be the older brother, not the father. This detracts a little from the romance, which is supposed to be May-September, not May-Decenber in character, but in the original film, Bogarts sheer charisma carried the day. Harrison Ford has many talents, but romance isn't one of them. He's a good performer in action flicks like &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; but he just has no chemistry here.<br />The worst of the pack is Julia Ormond, an otherwise fine British actress (&quot;Smilla's Sense of Snow&quot;). She is everything wrong for Sabrina -- I can only think they picked her for her smooth voice and accent, which do superficially resemble Ms. Hepburn's. But Julia Ormond is too old to play Sabrina (she was in her thirties when it was filmed and Sabrina is supposed to be about 20!) and doesn't come across as an ingenue. She is just plain painful in the early scenes, where the costume/makeup people went into overtime making her a frump with mounds of frizzy hair. Later, she is &quot;transformed&quot; with a short haircut but unlike Audrey Hepburn -- one woman who was utterly enchanting and beautiful with very very short hair, a hard look to carry off -- Julia looks just awful. It's an unflattering cut and served only to make her look even more mature, rather than sophisticated and charming.<br />Much of the delightful, sparkling dialogue has been chopped out, towards what end I can't imagine. Also,instead of going to Paris and training as a chef (a very acceptable modern profession for a woman!), they have decided to make Sabrina a Vogue fashion photographer (despite no previous interest or background in photography OR fashion). Frankly, I think the writers were getting &quot;Sabrina&quot; mixed up with Audrey Hepburn's other great classic &quot;Funny Face&quot;, where she plays a frump-become-fashion-model. There is no other believable explanation! This also ruins her Paris experience, which was handled so delightfully in the original. If that isn't bad enough, they have innocent little Sabrina having a love affair, a point which terribly muddles the whole idea that she is a naive virgin pining for David. OK, frankly, not many girls stay virgins that long these days, but Sabrina had a reason for doing so and the additional lover (who is quite attractive) really skews the storyline off course.<br />As a fashion buff, one of the great charms of the original film is the utterly exquisite, iconic fashions wore by Audrey Hepburn, who was not only one of the most beautiful actresses of her day but one of the most stylish women ever, period. (Both Edith Head and Herbert Givenchy designed her costumes.) Every outfit she wore in the original film is an absolute style classic. Some, like the dress she wears to the Larrabee's party after returning from Paris -- a white, strapless gown with black embroidery and a long swishy train -- are so absolutely breathtaking that the hairs on the back of your neck go up when you see her.<br />In contrast, the remake &quot;Sabrina&quot; has some of the lamest, plainest costumes I have ever seen. In the identical scene (the party), Sabrina wears a drab, dark green evening dress. Not that Julia Ormond isn't attractive, but there is nothing dramatic or stunning about her appearance that would make every head turn when she enters...it's even more lame when other characters, like Mrs. Larrabee (the late Nancy Marchand, in her last role) make comments about how ravishing she is.<br />Actually, while the filmmakers were &quot;updating&quot; Sabrina to be politically correct, I wonder why they didn't consider making Sabrina and her chaffeur father African American or Hispanic? Certainly that would reflect the reality in the 90s of what ethnic background servants to the very rich are likely to come from. (How often do you see a British chaffeur, really? Almost never! and why would Sabrina, who was raised in the US have a British accent anyways?) I think an interraccial romance would emphasize the cultural/economic differences between the Larrabees and the Fairchilds in a way that modern audiences could truly understand. BTW: I think Hallie Berry or Jennifer Lopez might have done very well in that kind of remake, and they each have a &quot;star&quot; quality that Ms.Ormond utterly lacks. Well, just my two cents.<br />At any rate, this is a lifeless, tired and completely unnecessary remake. Do yourself a BIG favor and rent the original with Hepburn and Bogart and try to forget that this bloated remake was ever made.
B000268QB2|5.0|I gave this cd 5 stars based on it's quality as a debut album.  Keane certainly compares favorably to Coldplay, differing approaches to the same musical concept, but I think this album is better than Coldplay's Parachutes but not quite as polished as A Rush of Blood to the Head.  Keane certainly has identifiable musical influences.  While it may not be &quot;cool&quot; to refer to bands like Genesis, Supertramp, and Alan Parsons Project there is no mistaking some similarities.  Sunshine sounds like it could have come right off of an 80's APP album.  The singer's voice is also reminiscent of Christopher Cross, although not quite as falsetto.  For someone looking for a modern approach to keyboard-based music, Keane is top-notch.
031218087X|2.0|When i first read Da Vinci Code, i felt Dan Brown has it in him to write good stories...in fact, this books is equally thrilling...however, there are a lot of loop holes and at one point i was really frustrated by the ability of a 172 IQ susan Fletcher...<br />Cant believe that someone with that high IQ couldnt guess &quot;elements&quot; refered to chemistry, and that Tenkado pointing his 3 fingers meant difference in 238-235!<br />Couldnt believe that a person with that IQ needs that much of explaning from deputy director before she understands the plots....<br />poorly written...possibly for a reader with IQ of 70?
B00005JLWN|3.0|Equilibrium was a bit of a dissapointment for me. The cover of the DVD says &quot;Forget the Matrix!&quot; but after watching this once, it was swiftly returned to the shelf. The problem is, you go in thinking this is going to be a hyperactive action film with lots of action-packed fight scenes. The few fight scenes in the film are great, don't get me wrong, but they're too one-sided. Christian Bale's character is nigh-invincible from start to finish, which removes any real sense of dread you may get during the minimal fight scenes. Furthermore, while the characters aren't supposed to show emotion, which is the focus of the story, it also makes for some dull character interactions (except of course, when you can spot certain actors--cough, Taye Diggs--failing to appear emotionless). As I watched this movie, it felt like forever waiting for these so-called 'groundbreaking action scenes' this movie was hyped about. While it's not a bad movie, it's far from the greatest I've seen. &quot;Forget the Matrix&quot;? Likely Equilibrium will be the forgotten movie in a long line of action films.
B000002TQV|4.0|No doubt, this album sticks right with you the whole way and never loses consistency. Truly, this album is worshipped by many. Personally, as someone who has watched Radiohead develop and morph what seems like a hundred times over the last decade, this album doesn't quite do the trick the way OK Computer does. However, in context of the year 1995, when rock was finally dragging itself from the ashes of the emotionally valueless glam rock of the 80s, this album stands on its own.<BR>I won't right an individual song review, but I cannot write a review of the album without mentioning that with all else aside, Street Spirit is the best song that Thom Yorke has ever written, and that is a large accomplishment. It is the only song I can find that defines Radiohead through every album they have put out, even the notorious but brilliant Kid A. The emotion shines right out of this song from the opening guitar riff to the brilliant final orchestration (&quot;immerse your soul in love&quot;). A spectacular song. The only people on earth (and I mean this literally) who would not love this song are those who are so out of touch with their emotions that they never admit to feeling sad. Street Spirit captures sadness at a basic level and puts it to song. Without it, The Bends would be not much better than Pablo Honey. With it, the album crushes all other traditional alt-rock albums to that date. And then along came OK Computer...
B00005JM02|2.0|firstly i will explain my age and views. i am 16 and i also feel that the world needs less of this mushy morals rubbish. <BR>now i wouldnt say that there is that much wrong with finding nemo, i just think that the almost exemplary computer generation doesnt hide the feeling of &quot;hang on, disney have done this story before&quot;. yes, the plot is extremely old hat and didnt really grip me at all.many of the jokes were also too obvious for my taste, and the only thing that had me sort of laughing was the almost chilling alfred hitchcock tribute (MINE!!), but the rest of it didnt leave much to the imagination. another problem i had was the complete and utter overkill that went into advertisement and memorabilia. i think more went into that than the actual film production, and believe me thats quite heavy. i only think that exsessive merchendise should go from films that truly deserve it, say shrek 2 or the lion king for example. my only positives from this film were the sublime vocals of william dafoe, although jack nicholson could also have done,and the animation being almost realistic. i couldnt stand the now signature 'big event happens that endangers them all, something remarkable happens too save them, then you have a supposedly sad moment in which one of the characters seems to die then live,and the goopy moral is spat straight into your face'. but then again, i suppose that its disneys trademark, and one that i begin to tire of. the only disney film that hasnt really done that since the millenium started was the emperors new groove, which i would gladly choose over this soppy ,over sentimental twallop. <BR>you can click unhelpful if you want, but that would probably show that you have no sort of sense and only see the silky graphics over story and substance. kids love it, adults give to the hype, but IM not going to be fooled.

0446310786|5.0|This is probably the best and most poignant story about racism that I've ever read. It's mandatory reading for school kids, and rightly so. One of the best novels of the 20th century. It's a pity Harper Lee only wrote this one novel. Anyway, it's a tale about the sensational trial of a black man who is arrested for raping a white woman, but he's actually innocent of the crime. The whole thing is seen through the eyes of the white defense lawyer's daughter. Very compelling read.<br />David Rehak<br />author of &quot;Love and Madness&quot;
B00004Y6Q5|5.0|In the spirit of Laurie Anderson and John Cage, Clint Mansell makes his own minimalist statement here. He provides the perfect mentalscape for a movie which twitches and writhes, boogies at times, rolls and gently rocks. Dark night of the soul stuff, but also choppily foreward bound. The main theme is entirely memorable and will be repeating itself in your head for days, weeks, years to come!<br /> Kudos of course to the always on the mark Kronos Quartet. What can't these musicians play? If this is your initiation into their music, you must check out their huge output of CDs, everything ranging from traditional African music, baroque, to the most progressive modern composers. They are one of our national treasures!<br />If you're prone to nightmares, however, you might want to play this CD in the light of day, not the really early AM hours. Like the movie, it has a certain fatalistic quality about it. Suicide Hotline soundtrack, perhaps? For that matter, if you're feeling down in the dumps, don't go near the movie, either. It will just convince you that there is no point.

B00005JMFQ|1.0|This movie disappointed me greatly.  I love Hugh Grant, but this movie hurt me.  It was slow and not heart-warming and romantic.  The only part I adored was Hugh Grant, dancing around the Palace.  Other than that, I loathed the Porno actors scenes and the Guy who liked his best friends wife.  The entire movie was a let down.
0375432302|4.0|This book is good. It is good because it amuse you. It is good because it teach you (or at least it challenges you to investigate and learn in the process), and it is good because it has a good story in it. This book is not a nobel prize, it is a novel, just that. But be careful, if you are a devoted christian, a strict catholic practicant or a religious fanatic, this may not be for you.
B00004STUL|5.0|I love this movie.  It is funny and action-packed.  I just wish two could have copied the same formula.  It had too much action.  It made me dizzy.
B00008K9Z5|5.0|unlike limp bizkit, linkin park manages to put forward an excellent sophomore album. linkin park has a pretty unique sound, and it's quite easy to pick out which songs are theirs when listening to the radio. 'faint', 'numb', 'figure.09' are some of my favourites. it's a great album, and worth picking up.
6305252572|5.0|This is Eddie Murphy in is prime, when he was at the height of his acting career.  He is so wonderful in this movie.  He steals the show from Nick Nolte.
B00004Z459|5.0|a great debut from linkin park and nu-metal, a blend of rap and rock. although their album is relatively short (some 40-50 odd minutes), they manage to pour all their emotions into it, anger, fear, etc. the lyrics are rather dark, but it's excellent.
B00005JLR8|5.0|This movie was excellent.  I was laughing and crying and happy all at once.  This movie was not the normal hollywood movie, it was one that touched you.  The acting was great all around.

B00003CXB4|5.0|I love the Lion King and am even more happy that it is now on DVD.  It is funny, colorful, and has a message for myself and children.  I am happy that Disney put it on DVD.  The special features are an added bonus.  Thanks Disney.
B0002234LS|4.0|First of all this movie is not for everyone.  I recommend this movie to people who enjoyed the book, enjoy movies like the sixth sense, and to people who like movies that have lots of twists and turns.  <BR>The story is about Mort Rainey, an author who is now suffering from a recent divorce and is living in his get away cabin in a small town.  But when a supposedly crazy man from Mississippi shows up on his front porch and accuses him of plagerising his story, all hell breaks loose.<BR>I won't give away much else, but the rest of the story is genuinely creepy.<BR>The best thing about this movie is that it gets under your skin.  You'll find that a week later, you'll still be thinking about the ending and all the hints leading up to it.  The best Stephen King adaption in years (boy isn't that the truth).  This movie is highly recommended.  Don't just get this movie because of Johnny Depp.  He is a talented actor.  THAT IS IT!  <BR>Overall i gave this movie four stars because it wasn't what you would call a great movie.  This movie is very well made, but it is strictly entertainment.
B00005JM02|5.0|This movie was funny and heart-warming.  It is a must have for your animated collection.
0671027387|4.0|Good Book but will never exceed the popularity of Angels &amp; Demons or The Da Vinci code... a bit predictable... but well written...
B00005K3OT|5.0|This moving is moving and touching.  I loved how chocolate bought the town together.
B000002U8G|5.0|meddle was the fourth best album after the dark side of the moon,the wall and wish you were here and this album is one of my favourites due to the presence of great songs like one of these days and the 23 minute epic echoes.i wish i could have given this classic album more than five stars.highly recommended.
B00008EYA5|4.0|I loved this movie.  The cast of actors were funny and good.
B0000032LS|5.0|Thats a really hard question, because they're both so uberly awesome! I mean, this is what all soundtracks should be like. The ones that come out today, just mark some of the songs in the film, and they don't exactly make you replay the movie in your head when you listen to it. This is exactly what this soundtrack does! Just listening to \\"Time Warp\\" I want to get up and do the dance, and I can see the antics of Magenta, Riff Raff, Frank, Brad and Janet in my head. This soundtrack brings back so many memories! <br />I first watched this movie at a movie night at my soon to be boyfriend's house in 9th grade. After that I became obsessed with this movie! I later watched it again on tv by myself at home, and I realized that its one of those films, that just seems to be better if you're watching it with a group of really close friends. So, when my boyfriend gave me the soundtrack for V-day, (hahaha!) I was extactic after listening to it for the first time! Even though I was by myself, it brought back all the magic of the movie, both of the film itself, and of the craziness that insued while we were watching it! This is truly one of those soundtracks that can be listened to just for itself, and not for the movie! Known of the songs sound the same, and they all kinda make you sit up and go \\"What did they just say!?!?!\\" hahaha! Its a surprising and delighting album, and definately worth a buy, whether you've seen the film or not! And if you haven't, one listen to it, and you'll want to!
B00001IVOF|5.0|Since hip-hop has gone on somewhat of a downhill after the deaths of 2Pac and Biggie, we are left with rappers searching to sell records in the most common way [maybe easiest too]--mainstream. Some even began on the trend of hardcore but chose what sells more. Mobb Deep is a dynamic duo that will always endure the game because they stick to the trend of what they are best at--hard-core tales from the street. They don't stray but only try to make what they already know they can do even better than before. <BR>     The Infamous was a classic and so is this. There is not really a distinguishing element from either but simply a varied sound. More classics are made on this cd which includes Drop A Gem On Em which is a straight 2Pac diss. Next comes Nightime Vultures with Raekwon which just has a dark beat and some sick rhymes. Then there's G.O.D. pt 3 which is probably the best song. Prodigy's verse is amazing and the beat matches up. Lastly there is Hell On Earth [Front Lines] which is simply put, brilliant. The songs highlight exactly what it is that Mobb Deep has to offer.  <BR>     Mobb Deep is my favorite rap group and mostly due to Prodigy for his immensely thug-persona. He emmulates real hip-hop. Hopefully Amerikaz Nightmare can match up when it comes out in nearly a month. It is my most anticipated summer-album and after hearing Got It Twizted, it made it even more hard to wait.
0312995423|5.0|Digital Fortress I thought blew the socks off the DaVinci Code. Then that is my own opinion. Digital Fortress is about Susan Fletcher; a cryptologist working for the NSA (National Security Agency) who comes across an code that is unbreakable by TRANSLTR; a super computer that can crack a million lettered code in six minutes. <BR> Now the man who created the code; Mr. Tankado who worked for the NSA, but now he is dead and a ring that has the key to decipher the code is GONE! So now it is up to David; Susan's boyfriend where he goes on a cat-and-mouse chase to find the ring where he is being followed by a man in rim glasses. He then tries to get information out of the people David talked to, one person he just killed. Now back at NSA, Susan made a trace to see who sent the code, and all she has to go on is a name: NDaktoa. But there is something that is scary; if the code could be sold, then anyone in the world can send it to the NSA which it can cause havoc and release information about secret operations, protected witnesses, and just about every secret that the government has. It is then that Susan finds out that this Japanese man who wants the code is trying to buy it off of NDakota, and it turns out that NDakota is working for the NSA! So now, the man who's name is Greg Hale. He then kills one of his co-workers when the power goes out in the NSA building, and now he wants out! I am not yet done with the novel, but man I thought this was much better from Dan Brown. Since being what one reviewer a 'geek', there are some facts in here about the super computer clocking pretty fast with millions of processors going all at once. It can happen if someone is willing to put money into the machine. So if you want to check out a good thriller, read Digital Fortress.
B0000C7PQK|5.0|I think the reason that some people don't like this Voyageur CD by Enigma is because they're afraid of change and want to hopelessly hold onto what they thought or think Enigma should produce. The whole point of Cretu's project is to explore change and the different melodies he can splice together that no one has done before. I give this CD two thumbs up because it reflects the ever changing world by changing with it and doesn't cling to the old material and isn't repetitive.
B00004RFFI|4.0|I have had interest in the concept of severe weather for my entire life and had high expectations for the movie &quot;Twister&quot; and the result cuts boths ways for me.<br /> The movie is of a married meteoroligist couple who are in the midst of getting a divorce, and have not gotten along for a very long time and they make a new invention that they believe will help them see what it looks like, inside a full blown tornado. They have ambition to deploy this new technology to disperse 'lighter than air' radio transmitters into a twister and record the signals to see what it may look like inside a tornado.<br /> The special effects when the tornadoes strike are absolutely awesome not to mention the chase scenes especially towards the ending when the couple speed away from a tornado drive right through a house that was thrown onto the countryside road by a tornado (Impossible in real life) and the other of when a drive-in movie screen showing a snippet of the movie &quot;The Shining&quot; being ripped apart by a F5 tornado in the middle of the night.<br /> &quot;Twister&quot; though suffers from several things and I can sometimes see where some of the detractors are coming from when regarding this movie. While the action scenes and special effects are amazing, the movie's plot lacks a good flow and the film drags on and on in several places and one scene which is just like a boring day at home would've been better left out altogether. Plus the characters are very unconvincing and lack personality.<br /> Even for me who doesn't mind ocassional deviation from the laws of physics in movies, some of the tornadoe scenes are completely unrealistic. For example as I said earlier in a review, there is no way a twister could fling a whole house across a countryside road or even roll the whole intact house across the countryside because most houses are built on foundations and strong tornadoes in real life  would shed houses into tiny pieces or otherwise reduce them to ruin. An F5 tornado would leave nothing of a house behind and can even rip the pavement off a road if the conditions warrant. \<br /> This movie is nonetheless worth watching just for the tornadoes alone but this movie could have been a lot better than it turned out to be. While having it's share of flaws Roland Emmerich's &quot;The Day After Tomorrow&quot; is far superior on many levels and corrects a lot of the flaws of &quot;Twister&quot; in my opinion.n.

0380973634|5.0|Richard Mayhew, a young London businessman finds himself mixed up in the weird alternate reality of \\"London Below\\" when he rescues a strange girl named Door.  He joins her and a few other denizens from London Below --- such as the (ah, hell, why not?) irrepressible Marquis de Carabbas and the rather intense Hunter --- in her search for the Angel Islington, whom Door's father told her she could trust right before he and the rest of Door's family were murdered by two henchmen named Mr. Croup and Mr. Vandemar (who were hilarious, by the way).<br />Gaiman obviously had a lot of fun with names of tube stops and prominent places in London and with the possibilities for parallels between London Below and London Above.  I loved the sense of wonder and the sense of humor in Neverwhere, though both were balanced by the sense of darkness in the story.  Quintessential Gaiman.  A wonderful and imaginative book.
B0001IN0DA|2.0|wrestlemania 20 was supposed to be where it all begains again, insted it could be where it all ends, every match was average at best, the only real good matches on the card was the eddie guerrero vs kurt angle wwe title match, and the triple threat match with shawn micheals vs chris benoit vs triple h which could be considered the greatest wrestlemania matches ever, other then that every match was either cut short like the two fatal four way tag team matches, and the cruserweight open, the goldberg and brock leasner match was the worst matches ever. and i expected more out of the undertaker and kane match. if you like average, boring wrestling at most you will like this dvd only pick this dvd up because of the extras it offers on disc 3, if you want exiting wrestling tune into TNA where you will not be dissapointed.
B00005ATQF|5.0|This epic war piece depicting the vietnam war directed by ledgendary director Stanely Kubric will send chills down your spine. From the brutally boot camp to the battlefield, the soilders preparing for the war will make you feel all the pain and agony expierenced while in the military.<br />  However, this movie is definatly NOT for children. The violence is extremely brutal and GRAPHIC. And to my extreme horror in this movie, innocent women and children are slaughtered for even being in the vietnam area. Extrme profanity. Many F words and N words are used constantly. Its a war movie, so of course there is sexual content. There are prositutes roaming around the streets of vietnam bargining prices for their body.<br />  If I were to give this movie reasons for being rated R these would be it: for strong brutal and graphic violence, strong pervasive language, and for sexuality. But again that is just me.<br />  So, now that you have my opionon, if you choose to watch this movie, watch at your own risk.
B0000VAFO0|3.0|I wanted to love Underworld. The movie has a great look (and not just Kate Beckinsale in tight leather -- although admittedly that doesn't hurt). The special effects are fun and effective, something that doesn't always happen in movies like this. <br />What doesn't work is that other than Kate Beckinsale, who plays her part admirably, which is to look cool and vampy, the actors do a less believable job of playing their parts than a group of goth kids sitting around the coffeetable playing Vampyre the Masquerade. Admittedly, the plot seems directly stolen from the roleplaying game though probably more superficial than most game sessions.<br />For horror or vampire fans, it's worth a watch but I dare any true believer to accept Scott Speedman as being worthy of anything more than a walking blood supply.
B00006AFUR|5.0|Incredible Cd, Jared Leto not only kicks ass in requiem for a dream but has an amazing band with great lyrics and mesmerizing sounds. its hard to pick a favorite but my top 3 are &quot;93 million miles&quot;, &quot;Echelon&quot;, and &quot;Edge of the earth&quot;.
0800177177|5.0|Francis Ford Coppola breathed new life in to the classic vampire story by Bram Stoker, keeping faith with much of the original novel while adding his own touches that made it an artistic wonder.<br />The best parts of the movie are those that remain true to the book: Jonathan Harker's travel to the castle and fateful meeting with the Count; Harker's confrontation with Dracula's three vampire lovers; the newly arisen Lucy Westenra confrontation as a vampire with her loved ones in the cemetery; and the exciting race with the sun and the gypsies taking the coffin-bound Dracula to his castle.<br />The script follows Dracula's strengths and vulnerabilities faithfully. The Dracula of this movie walks in the daylight -- just as in the novel.<br />Even when the movie departs from the original and the plot lags with the romance of Dracula and Mina, Coppola creates breathtaking images with their own potent spell that held me enchanted.<br />Overall the performances are well done with one or two notable exceptions. Sadie Frost, however, steals the movie in the role of Lucy Westenra.<br />The movie, in my opinion, would have been better with more emphasis on horror. Dracula should be more scary than sympathetic.<br />Still, this is one of my favorite vampire movies ever and well worth repeated viewings.

0312995423|3.0|I am not a computer fan, so the computer technology here is all greek to me ~~ which still makes this an entertaining read. It's predictable, not as well-written as Dan Brown's later works, but still, it's a riveting read ~~ perfect for a hot summer day. <br />Susan Fletcher is one of the top cyber programmers at NSA, engaged to be married ~~ her finace' was sent off on a mysterious errand when she was called into work. Turns out to be a long day at work. NSA is the spy of all spies ~~ NSA is the mainframe for which the government depends on for its top secret intel files ~~ NSA can spy on just about anyone in the world with just a few keystrokes. And that is where the trouble begins. With an ambitious programmer dead, the race is on to prevent a meltdown among the investigating communities. Susan Fletcher finds herself right in the middle of a mess that she never thought she would be in.<br />It is interesting. The computer jargon would thrill my husband more than me, but it was still a fascinating read. It was a quick read ~~ Brown used his trademark skills here ~~ where every page is a suspense-filled page. In spite of its predictablity, it is a fun read.<br />6-28-04

How dare metallica slow the music down.I cannot imagine what they were thinking.These are words I have heard since this album came out.True fans of this band do not hate this masterpiece, but rather turn it up when sandman comes on.There are plenty of classics from start to finish on this disc.I do not compare this disc to any of their previous accomplishments because there is no comparison.What I mean is,is that all the riffage and all the butt kickin'grooves from the past are what they were,exactly that.But this albums complete change was so necessary to show these guys were more than thrash and more than just 4 guys playing the worlds greatest metal anthems.Definetly Metallica changed the face of metal over and over,but they redefined it with this one!

B000005L86|5.0|There are not enough good things to say about this profoundly serious, HEAVY HEAVY record.  The production is perfect - the vocals are otherworldly, the arrangements are brilliant - Perry's masterpiece.  The Congos walked it like they talked it - they were serious committed rastas - Cedric even made Perry locks up - and this record is the testament of serious religious commitment.  The album highlight is certainly Ark of the Covenant, but there are not even any average tracks.  Absolutely stratospheric.  The best twenty bucks I have ever spent, the highlight of my record collection.<br />DO NOT, however, &quot;save money&quot; on some crap recording made from a tape or old vinyl - buy THIS VERSION - this blood and fire reissue.  As always, Blood and Fire did a phenomenal remastering job - I wish they could get the rights to Culture's back catalog.
0780629450|5.0|Kenneth Branagh's \\"Hamlet\\" works so well on the big screen because the guy has a knack for Shakespeare, acting, directing, and knowing what \\"modern\\" audiences wanted out of a Shakespearean play. He takes the tale of Hamlet, prince of Denmark, and transports it to more of a modern setting (well, more modern than the 16th century). He assembles an all-star cast that includes Kate Winslett, Charlton Heston, Derek Jacobi, Billy Crystal, Jack Lemmon, Robin Williams among others in this adaptation of Shakespeare's classic. <br />Although 4 hours in length (mainly because every word in the play is inserted in the script), the stunning effect of the play is extraordinary. The backdrop for the ghost of Hamlet in the opening scene, the mirror used when Hamlet (Branaugh) is making his \\"To be or not to be\\" soliloquy, the palace in which Hamlet and Laertes fight, and the snowy landscape in which Fortenbras and his men arrive are all instances of using scenery and directing to update this version of the play. <br />Although the setting and interpretation of what Shakespeare intended are left in doubt, the movie itself is visually stunning and the acting is great. Although Branaugh hired a few American actors to take on some of Shakespeare's characters (for instance, Robin Williams plays Osric and Billy Crystal plays one of the gravediggers), there \\"American\\" accents are hardly noticed in the film. <br />As an educator, I also think this is a fantastic version to use as a resource for a study of the play. Because the dialogue is accurate to the play, it works well. Also, this version seemingly makes the work of Shakespeare easier to understand.  (Although, as a warning, there is one scene with Winslet (Ophelia) and Branaugh (Hamlet) that is definitely \\"adult\\" in nature). <br />Overall, a great gamble by Branaugh to update Shakespeare's work into his own insight. There is also a few extras on the VHS version: interviews with many of the cast members as well as a behind the scenes about the movie. <br />Also recommended: Hamlet (Mel Gibson version)
B000002UAU|5.0|&quot;Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; has to be both the pinnacle of the Beatles' creativity and the zenith of their unmatched (both critically and commercially) contributions to music, and to popular culture in general. After more than 35 years, this masterpiece is still as fresh, original and relevant today as it was when it was first unleashed upon the world in the Summer of 1967. It is extremely influential, astonishingly daring and highly imaginative all at the same time; and my estimation is that it will be studied and analysed (much like the best classical music by the great composers is studied in the present day) for centuries to come. Perhaps these claims are melodramatic and exagerrated, but I am reluctant to oppose these claims. So it is with a diplomatic heart that I name this album as a milestone of the arts and entertainment, and probably of Western civilisation. Lennon and McCartney's songwriting at it's most challenging, George Martin's tried and tested production, fantastic album sleeve containing cut outs (indicating that this is more than just an album), the most popular band in history coming close together and collaborating on making marvellous and mind taxing music - what more could any rockoholic ask for? &quot;So may I introduce to you, the act you've known for all these years, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band!&quot;
B00008YLV2|5.0|This film is perhaps Ridley Scott's greatest directing performance (Yes, just as good as Aliens and I love that film). He really took the time to accurately portray not the just the soldiers but the event itself with amazing detail. I had the good fortune of going to see this film in a cinema and I cant recall a sound being uttered from anyone as the audiences streamed out at it's conclusion. The imagery is stark and poignant and the music featured throughout adds a real authentic flavor. This film will go down in cinematic history as the real<BR>and definitive telling of the American Mogidishu operations. Every actor gives a standout performance and I feel confident did justice to the men who served in this conflict. Thank you Mr. Scott for your integrity and honorable efforts in bringing this important story to the masses.
0805062971|4.0|Chuck Pahlaniuk's Fight Club is a story of a man going through the motions, trying to find fulfillment and a cure for his insatiable insomnia. While at first he finds it in attending support groups for diseases, this idyllic way of dealing with his problems is soon crashed by fellow &quot;tourist&quot; Marla. Everything changes in a chance encounter with the free-spirited Tyler Durden, and the two men bond through violence, starting an underground &quot;Fight Club&quot;. However, a way to deal soon spirals out of control as Tyler reveals his purpose is truly for anarchist destruction. <br />The novel's strength is in its intense, pulse-pounding narrative, its fractured, experimental prose, and its brilliant characterization of men and society on the edge. Fight Club is about what happens in a society of boredom, and what happens when life has no rules and no brakes. But Palahniuk doesn't once get preachy; the narrative doesn't need to proselytize to get its point across. The darkness is evident in the malicious, unrestrained glee of the character of Tyler Durden. And the chilling thing is, its just like the book says. Tyler Durden, leader of a terrorist cult, is exactly who we wish we could be.

B000002NHN|5.0|Every song here is unique, and a very nice addition to the great Celtic tradition. The linear notes are very informative too, in showing the many potential links between Celtic and other cultures, even Greek and Siberian. But the last song &quot;Dante's Prayer&quot; is among the finest I've ever heard anywhere. I was knocked out the first time I heard it, and still play it several times a week! Thankfully the lyrics are printed in the notes, since Loreena does have an accent that can be tough to follow for a state -sider. An album for the ages, with the grand finale (Dante's Prayer) that you'll replay for many years to come!
0156027321|5.0|Warning:  ending discussed<br />My take on this book is the strength of God's gift to Pi (and to all of us).  God gives us the ability to imagine . . . which is an essential component to deep and true faith in your religion(s).  During his ordeal at sea, Pi (in my opinion) has the ability to imagine the people on the boat as animals, which clearly is the sole reason for his survival.  Had Pi not had this ability to change his perception, he surely would have perished like the others.  The reality of what actually happened and who actually was on the boat would have been overwhelming.  He was able to alter reality, thanks to God's gift, and utilize this alteration as the foundation of his survival.

B0001NBMBC|5.0|slipknot began as a 5 man group, now a nine man tornado as they roar through the music world once more with their third album, totally (sic) and new by my standards.  hardcore nu-metal and acoustics bring a blend of the slipknt we all know and love with corey taylor's other band:  Stonesour, a soothing rythmn with a hard rock feel within.  <BR>slipknot has definetly outdone themselves.  i love their new album!!!
B00009V7RF|5.0|I hardly buy CDs these days because it's not worth buying a cd for 2 or 3 songs but having heard a few a few tunes on the radio and listening to samples on iTunes I thought I'd give it a shot and pick it up.<BR>Well from day one of throwing this disc in my cd player I have yet to take it out. This disc has the great beats and great lyrical melodies that you don't find on some of the music that is out these days.<br />If your looking for a disc where you can enjoy all the tracks from start to finish, I definately recommend this one.<BR>Tracks to definately listen to are: Let's get retarded, hey mama, shut up, smells like funk, Fly away, boogie that be, APL Song, Where is the love?
1594200106|5.0|I read this book on a flight from Amsterdam to San Francisco. I could not put it down. The author develops the characters very well and moves the story along at a natural pace. The writing is  great. His descriptions of scenery and moods really evoke the time and place in which the story takes place. I got this book in part because I've been to Barcelona many times and know exactly the neighborhoods, streets, and plazas mentioned in the story. I even stayed in the Avenida Tibidabo area where much of the action takes place. The translator did a marvelous job. Lucia Graves is the daughter of poet Robert Graves. She's a writer and in fact I'd read her semi-autobiographical book which is a must read for anyone who wants to know about Spain (she grew up there during the Franco years, married a Spanish man, etc.). I was even more encouraged to get this book when I saw that she was the translator.
B0001ZX0OM|5.0|This movie was sooo touching.  I felt everything as if I were there.  Sean Penn was beyond excellent. I recommend this movie on a night at home where you just want to be reminded of how precious life can be.  I don't have any fancy words or spectatular review to give except to say that the movie was good, the acting was excellent and the story line was real.
B000148KK2|5.0|Unless you're a jazz vocal afficianado, which I am not, Diana Krall's music may have to grow on you.  Every time I listen to this album, I like it more.  And that's the way it was with the first DK album I bought.  I can accept her interpretation of the jazz standards without question.  With this album she's brought some of her own writing talent to the table and I happen to like it, too.  Even 'Changed My Address' has become one of my favorites.  Listen, then listen again.  I think you'll ultimately like what you hear.<br />WT
B00005JMX6|4.0|I don't know why the critics bashed this movie so hard! Some said it was because the commercials were deceiving, to which I replay that almost all commercials are deceptive! To me this is one of the funniest movies of this year, and I've seen literally everything that's come out thus far. Cuthbert is amazingly hot, and this is maybe the one time where Emile Hirsch didn't annoy me in a movie. Give this one a chance and judge it for yourself.

6305603847|5.0|It seems to me that Roger Waters has us all fooled, that this was actually a parody of the highest order.  If you watch the interview with him on the bonus materials on the DVD, you can almost see him smile when he discusses the inspiration for this film.  It's a film that we read into it what we will.  To a small degree, it is autobiographical (most everyone knows about the incident when he spit on a fan during the Animals tour).<br />Taking that as a leaping off point, he takes the conclusion of the absurdity of the rock star life to its logical end.  And it is brilliant.  Pink Floyd was simply not the same after the breakup.<br />It is visually and viscerally stunning.  I used to watch this over and over again and it seemed to tap into what I was feeling at the time and it provided comfort, a sense that someone else could relate to the isolation and loneliness I felt, even in the midst of people.  I had to replace my vinyl record several times because I listened to it so much.  The movie provides eye candy for the songs.<br />The plot is quite simple: Pink ('by the way, which one's Pink?') is a rock star whose about had enough of the excess and snaps, journeying into his brain way too far.  We see the meltdown unfold and follow the transition to something much more frightening, gaining a vision of just how far human vanity can take us.  The songs and the visuals form a cohesive whole.  <br />Sure it's pretentious and takes itself too seriously at times - but isn't that the point?  It works.  <br />It's one of the darker takes on this life but it nails it brilliantly.  You'll find that many of the scenes are bigger than the context of the film.  Many of them could be related to events in the political or social sphere of then and today.   <br />It's a bit dated, perhaps, or I've merely gotten older.  But the extras on the DVD make it worthwhile, including the video for 'Hey You' featuring footage that didn't make it into the film.
B000148KK2|2.0|I have all of her Verve recordings.  They have all be excellent, until this one;  The musicianship and production on this album are outstanding (typical Verve), but the material is weak.  One would think with some of the best musicians in the buisiness one couldn't  go wrong.  Oh well, I hope she makes a strong come back on her next album and that she doesn't let Elvis drag her down.
B00005B36H|5.0|Yes, you read right. Sure, it's their most indulgent work to date, but there is a lot to love about this album. For one thing, it's good to know that the band has matured after 5 years. Also, this time, they don't use anti-religious themes of their older albums, which had songs that turned me off because of that (most of it against Christianity; though I guess it makes sense considering how Maynard was raised). However, some of it about hypocrisy wasn't completely bad, as sometimes that can be true of the believers, but I wish they had left that alone, although I realize many fans enjoyed that, and it's already been done. However, I did enjoy the other songs from them, most of Aenima, although I generally skipped &quot;Eulogy&quot; for obvious reason, but even the interludes were interesting to say the least. &quot;Third Eye&quot; was powerful enough to consider it a great record. Nothing on here that powerful, and not as song-based as Undertow, but still an effort that I love, and it's just as good musically. I didn't mind the other lyrics, though.<BR>Also, the music is really interesting to hear, since some songs will be really agressive and then get to a real quiet part. Take for instance, &quot;Ticks and Leeches&quot;, which has Danny Carey's drumming throughout (best drummer ever!) and great lyrics if you like something angry. It's still melodic, believe it or not. This is the only one where Maynard really screams on the album. After three and a half minutes, it gets much quieter, and there aren't audible lyrics for a while. It gets to that peaceful part for quite awhile, but then the heavy riffage of Adam Jones comes in, and then Maynard's &quot;hope this is what you wanted&quot; shout comes in. It's great that there is all of that in just one song, albeit one that is 8 minutes long.<br />Which is the same length frame as &quot;The Grudge&quot;. I love how it starts immediately, and there are great lyrics on this. Even if you're not a big fan, I would still have to say that they've made better lyrics with each album, this being no exception. It's the only one here that would fit on a past release of theirs, one reason it was great to place it first.<br />&quot;Parabol&quot; and &quot;Parabola&quot; are kind of like two songs in one, something common on this album, so if you like consistency and flow, you've found the right album. It is one of the great moments of the disc. I like the &quot;celebrate this chance to be alive and breathing&quot; lyrics, and musically, the riffs are amazing, especially in the last two minutes of the latter. The first one is like a buildup track to the next, although of course there is lyrics, but distortion doesn't come in yet until you get to &quot;Parabola&quot;.<br />That's not the only place where full songs mold together. There is &quot;Disposition&quot;, &quot;Reflection&quot;, and &quot;Triad&quot; which all flow together. The first of the tracks is interesting, and I like the guitars. The drums sound cool when it ends, then gets to &quot;Reflection&quot;, where it becomes amazing. It's 11 minutes, yet very melodic vocals of Maynard. Probably my favorite track from the album. Then comes in the instrumental &quot;Triad&quot;, which is a great song to end the album, of course excluding the weird &quot;Faaip De Oiad&quot;.<br />Everyone's heard &quot;Schism&quot;, and I fell in love with that one from the time I heard the solo section. &quot;The Patient&quot; is kind of funny hearing, as it's like a subconscious message that the band are telling you on the album, seeing as it's 13 tracks that are nearly in an 80 minute record. Not much else to say about that, as this one starts from the interlude-type &quot;Eon Blue Apocolypse&quot;.<BR>The title track is a great nine-minute track, which does a lot of things already described, but listening is where you'll find its identity.<br />All in all, you get what you pay for, seeing as this is such a great, powerful album. Not for everyone, but still great. I can't see how too many people who don't like Tool wouldn't like it.
B0001Z53AQ|1.0|This album lacks style, creativity, and most of all D12!!! If Eminem wanted to be on every song and every verse then he should have just made his own album. They weren't kidding when they made &quot;My Band&quot; (they should cut his mic off when the music starts!) All the rappers that consist of this group have en extreme amount of talent, but at least let em get a little air play once in a while.... now i know why 50 cent didn't want him on the G-Unit album
B00000294R|5.0|If you don't own this cd and his next one you aint hip-hop... get to the store and cop this record before all ur credibility falls off... he's one of the best from the buroughs...  R.I.P. Big L
B00023BLXK|4.0|I saw this movie a while back and I thought it was cute. It had that Latin flavor in it with a twist of hip-hop. I have been dancing for years and i thought it was very impressive for some of the moves they had picked up on. It seemed rather sad how Patrick Swayze tried to re-live the moment from the first movie other than that I would say this movie is for young teens now who haven't seen the first Dirty Dancing, other then that I wouldn't say this is the movie for people who fell in love with the first Dirty Dancing.
B0000C9ZLD|4.0|hmm let's see well I'm like a huuuuge Strokes fan, I mean I love everything that has to do with them, all their music I mean my favorite one is like Reptilia, it's waaay too cool!! And well I listened to this CD and it's like so good! Honestly, I mean the songs I like the most are &quot;reptilia&quot; (duh), &quot;12:51&quot; and &quot;whatever happened&quot; but the other ones are really great too! So yeah I really recommend you guys buy this album, anyway...I mean, if u like the strokes, because if you're not into their music then really it's not worth it. Anyway, I love it!!
B00003CXCT|5.0|I can't wait any longer for this awesome trilogy on come to DVD. I love the SE and after watching it I can no longer watch the originals the quality alone is just horrible, and that was all cleaned up for the special editions. The story was never changed or effected in anyway with Lucas adding effects, the only problem I have is Greedo shooting first(I mean that was just dumb!) but I think everything else is fine and more changes should be made for the release of the DVDS mainly changing the Emperor in ESB to Ian McDiarmid. I love this trilogy and the prequels are amazing as well can't wait until all 6 are on DVD and I can only hope the fans can talk Lucas into 7-9.
B000022TSW|5.0|rude, vulgar, offensive.......... I LOVE IT!!!
1592400876|5.0|I'm for the Oxford comma!  I use it in my personal life (although I don't teach it to students).  I'm also glad to see that if I lived in England, my preference to put commas or periods outside the quotation marks in certain circumstances would be appropriate.  <br />It also answered a long term uneasiness about the proper way to punctuation a singular posessive when the noun ends in an s.  <br />This book was funny and I thought the history behind punctuation was incredibly interesting.  It gave my husband and me conversation topics the entire time I read it.
0790729970|5.0|Did you know that this excellent comedy was planed to be a horror?! Based on popular comic, THE MASK would be a storu about green killer who tells sarcastic remarks, while he's tearing a part his victims with an axe. But, when director Chuck Russell got Jim Carrey for this role he decided to do a comedy. And lucky for him and us he did a great job. I remember when I saw THE MASK for the first time. Fantastic story, interesting characters, and of course, Jim Carrey in role which made him famous. Story is about unsuccessful, shy banker who comes in possesion of an ancient wooden mask which turnes him into a wild, green, party creature who now has everything: powers, money and love. It influented on me so much that I find the same dog like Milo (that is one damn smart dog!). Carry gave the best of himself: he danced, sang and made jokes all the time. Cameron Diaz left me breathless, and two caps..., well, see it for yourself. This film guaranties fun whole 90 minutes it lasts and trust me, you will love it.
B0001ZX0PG|5.0|I liked this riveting but dark movie in which actions of the past play into present deeds.  <br />Besides the outstanding acting of Sean Penn the other highlights of this movie are the mood set by the streets of Boston and the haunting music which was composed by the director, Eastwood.
B0000CGV00|5.0|I purchased this disc primarily for the &quot;choral fantasy&quot; and &quot;the tempest&quot; written by Beethoven and was not in any manner dissapointed. In fact, this is the best &quot;choral fantasy&quot; I have heard. The emotion of this music literally pours from the speakers.<br />  Much to my surprise, though, the work I have listened to most often, with rapt attention, is the title track &quot;Credo&quot; (by Arvo Part, a composer I thought I wasn't fond of). Upon first listening, I literally said &quot;Wow!&quot; This is powerful music and led me to change my opinion of Arvo Part. For those of you who, like me, disdain most modern works, this may change your opinion. Very highly recommeded!
0553579908|4.0|I started this series on vacation; my sister had the first book.  So far all three published books in the series are consistent, engrossing, and very entertaining.  Can't wait for the fourth one to come out!
B0001ZX0OW|2.0|My sister rented this movie and I'm glad she did. Saved me twenty dollars on this insipid farce of a drama! I cannot believe this was nominated for best picture, let alone all the critical hype. I thought this movie was going to be a great drama, or so I thought. Small town tragedy leads three broken friends to reunite after Sean Penn's daughter is murdered. It had its moments..and Sean Penn is a notable actor, but the ending left me cold and stunned. So much for morality. The look on Marcia Gay Harden's face as she searches helplessly for her husband and the unrepentant Laura Linney's gleeful smile is sickening....all and all this movie is okay for a rental...save yourself the twenty bucks..maybe the book is better,,they almost always are....disappointing Mr. Eastwoood...a waste of time
B00004YYDI|4.0|REALLY GREAT! IT WAS DONE LIKE A FOREIGN FILM, BUT I REALLY LOVED THE WAY IT WAS DONE. AND THE ACTING WAS GREAT!
0783232039|4.0|I have seen this movie at least 3 times at the most and I most say this movie is indeed hilarious. This film appears to be more of a comedy than a horror film and it's definately not for 11 year olds to be watching.  It's definately worth adding to the video collection.

B0001ZMBV0|5.0|Although he never received the publicity accorded to some more famous conductors, Carlo Maria Giulini was equal to, or better than, all such &quot;star&quot; conductors. In fact, Giulini was quite simply one of the half dozen or so greatest conductors of the 20th century. Although Giulini recorded with many major orchestras, some of his finest recordings were made with the Chicago Symphany Orchestra. Several of his finest recordings are contained in this outstanding collection. If you are familiar with these recordings from LPs here's your chance to get them on CD. If you are not yet familiar with this outstanding conductor, this collection is an excellent introduction to some of his finest work.
6305327084|5.0|Humphrey Bogart would say the Beautiful Girls in this film are the \\"stuff dreams are made of.\\"  They stand for the idealized version of women that men seek and never find, the constant promise of a better woman just around the corner that keeps men from being able to commit to the real women in their lives.<br />The principle men with that \\"beautiful girls\\" hang-up are Willie (Hutton), Birdy (Dillon) and Paul (Rappaport).   They hold on to that dream of a better life with a better woman and thus sabotage (consciously or not) all their relationships.    Birdy clings to the memories of his high school flame, Paul papers his walls with supermodels and names his dog Elle McPherson, and Willie just wants something beautiful in his life.  Although in a relationship with a nice-looking attorney, Willie grudgingly acknowledges she would only score a 7.5 on a 1-10 scale.   <br />While not actively looking to replace his  \\"above-average-but-not-great\\" girlfriend, Willie stumbles into the most charming and memorable sub-plot of the film: his relationship with his thirteen year old neighbor Marty (a totally engaging Natalie Portman).   Willie sees in her all the possibilities he dreams about: she is kind, sensitive and dazzles him with her knowledge of psychology and Shakespeare.  When she develops a teenage crush on him, Willie must consider the possibility of waiting  for this great girl to become an even greater woman.   Even though parallels are drawn to the pedophilic exploits of Roman Rolanski and Jerry Lee Lewis, there is nothing creepy or sexual about Willie's feelings for the young girl.   <br />The stories play out in a picturesque New England town, deep into a frozen winter.   All the guys are re-uniting for their ten-year high school reunion and are forced to deal with the personal revelations accompanying that important moment.  Presented with a karaoke bar's dream soundtrack and told with a thoughtful narrative that is poignant and touching without being sappy andsentimental, Beautiful Girls is a wonderful exploration into the love lives of 20-something males.
B000002HH2|5.0|I was recently on vacation in Puerto Rico and wanted to buy some CD's for the rental car. The only two cd's in the store worth buying were Janet Jackson's Design of a Decade and Bjork's &quot;Debut&quot;. I listended to both CD's throughout my trip. I have been a Janet Jackson fan for sometime, but Bjork got under my skin on this trip. I am now a full-fledged fanatic. I never realized that almost all of Bjork's songs are love songs. The only remote comparison I can make of her is like a Nordic, deconstructed, sometimes minimal, electronic Billie Holliday. She can be gloomy, elated, ecstatic, whatever. When she sings, the songs are hers.<BR>My favorite song on the CD is Isobel. Listen to Missy Elliot's &quot;Really Hot&quot; and see how ahead of her time Bjork is. The beat sequence is almost identical.<BR>Possibly, Maybe is another beauty. It hits the feeling of a breakup on the nose.<br />To all of the people who wrote bad reviews of Bjork, if you don't have something nice to say..... Bjork has been singing most of her life and experts would agree, she has a natural singing voice and an expressive and wide vocal range. Can anyone complaining make those sounds with their voices, on key no less? She knows music inside and out, and the wierd and avant garde sounds are INTENTIONAL. Besides, one has to have an acute knowledge of music to turn it inside out like that. Listen closely and you will hear the genius. Barbara Streisand has been done. We don't need anymore singers sounding like someone else.<br />Also, the videos from her DVD collection go hand in hand with the songs. You really get the true meaning and a grasp of the songs.
0783240236|5.0|Hitchcook can make anything scary, and this movie is profff, I don't no how fake birds can be scary but they are, in this film anyway.<br />It all starts with an opener that's more like 2 people trying to play a joke on eatchother, and ends with a tailhanger ending, paked with scares and creeps this is a must see.
B00009V7T2|4.0|Before I ever heard the Mars Volta I listened to some Sparta (which i didn't like cause....the lead singers voice just wasn't appealing to me, very forgettable), and I wasn't really sure I was going to like it but my friends put it on one day and damn, it was stuck in my head for the longest time that I had to go out and buy the cd.<br />Reading some of the other reviews here you can tell some of them probably didn't listen to the whole cd or listen to certain songs the whole way through (like the 12 minutes of cicatriz esp, my favorite song on the whole cd), or they probably believe Nickelback makes good &quot;hard&quot; rock (no offense to trendy music listeners cause I listen to rap/hip hop and pop rock stuff too), or they believe the price of the cd means its not that good (come on now, it was released over a year ago, of course its $10), or maybe some of them just liked Sparta over The Mars Volta, but regardless, this is some of the best music I've heard ever. And who cares if what the singer says doesnt make sense? It fits in perfectly with the music alot better than most groups with lyrics that actually make sense. You must be crazy if you're actually buying a cd based on what the singer is saying!<br />The only person who I showed showed this music and they told me they didn't like it turned out to be a hardcore sparta fan. My brother likes it, my little sister likes it, and all my friends do too. If you end up not liking it, check your head.
B000063DFQ|5.0|What's to be said about &quot;Piece of Mind&quot; that hasn't been said already?  Yes, any self respecting metal head or Maiden fan knows of such classics as &quot;Number of the Beast&quot;, &quot;Powerslave&quot;, and &quot;Killers&quot;; but &quot;Piece of Mind&quot; is just yet another album which shows Maiden at their best.  The roaring opener &quot;Where Eagles Dare&quot; shows the band at their musical best, followed by &quot;Flight of Icarus&quot; which has an amazing and catchy chorus that you won't be able to deny yourself to headbang to.  &quot;Die With Your Boots On&quot; is a classic track, and oh yeah, there's another song on here called &quot;The Trooper&quot; which you may have heard of.  There isn't a single song on here that seems out of place or could be considered filler, and &quot;Piece of Mind&quot; is just another classic album from the legendary rockers.
B000001EHS|5.0|Through tragedy and obsessive life styles, this band made a lot of very good rock music.  All 15 songs here are good and most, if not all got main stream radio play time.  I think Animal and Rocket are 2 of the best rock songs ever.  They were mega-worldwide stars while still very young, and their creativity, lyrics and guitar playing still amaze me after all these years.
0440234743|4.0|I've felt that Grisham has been in the midst of a literary downslide for the past several years. The Testament, however, was an interesting and refreshing change of pace for the author. I was taken along on a satisfying roller-coaster ride in which I thought I knew how it would end -- but was ultimately way, way off-base. The characters were all interesting -- not entirely likeable, but interesting nonetheless -- and the pacing was more than enough to keep me turning the pages. I think anyone who enjoyed Grisham's earlier work will enjoy this one as well.<br />As side note, why does nearly *everyone* insist on summarizing the plot -- yet again -- when reviewing novels? Is it just me or, by the one-thousandth customer review, shouldn't we get the general idea?
0060555661|2.0|I was deciding between getting this edition or the more expensive hardbound edition (which does not contain the Jason Zweig commentaries).  I naturally thought, why not go for the cheaper one and get the commentary for free?  After all, I could just ignore the commentary if it doesn't help.<br />Bad bad choice.  It was like choosing between a Beethoven CD and the same CD but with free shrieking commentary by a Damon Wayans movie character during and in between each symphony.  <br />Zweig's writing when inserted between Graham's is like the annoying paperclip in MS Office, except there is no way to turn it off.  He's in the footnotes (virtually every page!), he's in between every chapter.  Open the book at a random page, and most likely you'll open it to a Zweig page.<br />The content and style of his writing feels condescending and contrasts so much with Graham's.  When reading Graham you have elegant timeless prose by a humble, wise man who makes you feel he is sincerely interested in your well-being. By contrast, Zweig feels like someone who wants to impress you with his word plays, and puns.  He really should have attempted to recede into the background and limited his voice.<br />I would recommend everyone to just buy the hardcover edition.  <br />Buy Graham only.  If you cannot read Graham, Zweig will only help marginally, and you still need to verify his comments against other contemporary Graham commentators. Get another book. If you *can* read Graham, then you do not need the commentaries in this book.  Any questions you may have can be answered in thousands of sites on the net.

B0000024JA|5.0|I don't know how anyone could find Method Man's &quot;Tical&quot; or any other solo member of the &quot;Wu&quot; album's disappointing.  &quot;Tical&quot; marked the beginning of the Meth era...Keep it up KID!  I must say I have been a fan of the Wu-Tang Clan for a long time; and they said it best on the Enter the Wu Tang (36 Chambers) CD.  They &quot;form&quot; like &quot;Voltron&quot;.  Every member has something special to offer.  Prime example, look at the ODB! ALL members of the &quot;clan&quot; have a unique style.  His style (Method), separates him from the rest of the &quot;clan&quot;!  One fact remains, each member of the &quot;Wu&quot; is lyrically gifted!  The &quot;Tical&quot; CD not only made &quot;Meth&quot; the solo artist that he is; but it paved the way for the rest of the Wu-Tang Clan.  He gave real Wu-Tang fans something to look forward to, a sequel to the 36 chambers, &quot;solo style&quot;.  I'm not saying &quot;Meth&quot; is the best of the clan,  I have several favorites!!  I'm saying &quot;surprisingly disappointing&quot; (aka brother ike) check your Wu-Tang history.  Historically, all of the artist talk about preserving the Wu-Tang family through music!  From the way it sounds &quot;Surprisingly Disappointing&quot; aka (brother ike) could use a refresher course  on Wu-Tang &quot;lyranomics&quot;.  NO HARD FEELINGS TO ANY WU-TANG FAN, just trying to preserve the family through..the honest truth!<BR>Lone Wolf
B000089RVX|3.0|I listened to this cd when everyone started making a big deal about it and I see why they did. The cd was built to please the simple minds and catchy phrase crowd. The singer has a great voice but at the same time she dominates the band. The few times I have seen them on TV I only see her and in the music her vocals take over the whole show. If she gets a good group around her and learns to let the whole sound come out with her vocals then Evanescence could be a good band.
B00006RINF|2.0|This band has some good music, but the male vocalist has simply got to go. He contributes absolutely nothing to this album (except making my head hurt) and ruins almost every song on the disc. And after you get rid of him, turn up the volume for the female vocalist! If you just had her singing, even though she doesn't appear to have the vocal range of Amy Lee (Evanescence), at least  LC's music is much less Top 40-ish and the guitar work is better. Without the male vocalist, this band could be much, much better.
B00005Y6YB|5.0|240 minutes refers to the much shorter Return to Lonesome Dove mini-series.  There is nowhere on the the Amazon website that the original series of Lonesome Dove DVD set is only 240 minutes, it is 360 minutes.<br />By the way, my daughter and I loved this series when it was on TV and I purchased the multi-tape set VHS way back when.  But the last tape was bad and Cabin Fever, the manufacturers/publishers, would not replace my bad tape (they never even answered my mail except to tell me how to order the set), so, now that I have the DVD version, I finally have a complete set of watchable scenes.

Dieses Buch ist sehr gut fr alle Studenten, die ihren deutschen Wortschatz vergrssern mchten. Manche Ausdrcke in diesem Buch, wird man nie im Klassenzimmer lernen.

B00025ETIW|5.0|I've been a fan of MCR since I first found I Brought You My Bullets... so when I first heard this CD (the day it came out) I was a little disappointed that they changed direction. After a couple more listens I was hooked. It's undeniably catchy, well-written and well-produced. Each song brings something different to the CD and all are great in their own way. You can listen to the CD and every track will draw you in without sounding the same as every other track on it. Now I have to say that this CD demolishes their first one. I also have to kick myself for saying that they changed direction. It's not different, they just used a different approach and had major-label production on their side this time. Three Cheers even has kind of a story to it if you pay attention, so it's fun to try to follow what it's trying to say. These guys are gonna be huge once word is out, so go buy it now. Everyone I've played it for has fallen in love with it. It hasn't come out of my CD player since the day it came out (3 weeks ago or so) and I'm not nearly bored with it, yet. One last note: I NEVER write reviews for CDs, so that should say something about this one!

B00005JKN9|2.0|When I first began watching Gangs of New York, I thought I was viewing a masterpiece.  It certainly looks like one, with inspired photography and completely authentic-looking, well, everything.  However, the further into the movie I got, the less I was sure that this was the kind of story that masterpieces are made of.  It isn't the length of the film--directors shouldn't be afraid to take their time when telling a story.  While the characters are compelling at first, the more they fight and the more things they set on fire, the less I cared about the outcome of the &quot;war.&quot;  In the end, I didn't like any of the characters, and with the last ten or fifteen minutes of the movie being comprised completely of violence, I left the film with a bad taste in my mouth.  The violence didn't offend me or move me in any way--it just got very boring after three hours.  <br />Some reviewers have commented on the miscasting of DiCaprio and Diaz.  I don't know if they were really miscast, or if their characters just weren't developed well-enough and paled in comparison to the more fully drawn Bill Cutting, who is played very impressively by Daniel Day-Lewis.  By the end of the film, I was actually rooting for the Butcher, just because he seemed to actually be motivated by something real (his own racism and pride), as opposed to whatever was supposed to be motivating Amsterdam Vallon (who definitely had the best name of any character in the movie, I might add).<br />Overall, Gangs of New York was a good film, with epic visuals, but it fails somehow in the end, when the potentially great story-line it begins with is overrun by excessive violence.  Still, this is all subjective, and I wouldn't discourage anyone from renting it.  I'm glad I watched it; I just don't plan on doing so a second time.

B000003TA4|5.0|I'm sorry, but AFI K. James is an utter creep. And no, not the Negative variety, he's more like the malicious kind who never has anything good to say about anything, and continues to harass people when they aren't swayed by his stupidity. The bottom line: Everybody likes what they like. And if you don't like that philosophy, go the hell away from us actual human beings and rot alone behind your wall of loneliness. Everybody likes their own type of music, so leave it at that. I can see the validity of a less-than-shining review of a Nirvana album, so long as the reviewer is honestly expressing how they aren't satisfied with what it offers. AFI K. James just rips Nirvana because he has nothing better to do on Friday nights, weekends, and weekdays than to submit rip after rip of Nirvana. What's more, he copies & pastes his \\"reviews\\" and \\"band recommendations\\" from other people without their consent! So not only is he a nuisance that needs booting off Amazon, he's also plagiarizer. I think that is grounds to boot the guy of of Amazon. All in all, Nevermind is a good record, people. It's worth buying just as much as anything else.
B0000DD7LB|3.0|However coy she might be in her public statements, Britney Spears leans more than a bit toward the provocative on In the Zone. Less concerned with aiming at the mainstream radio dial than in the first days of her career, she and her collaborators make this as street and club ready a record as possible. The opening duet with Madonna, &quot;Me Against the Music,&quot; is worthy, but the bigger superstar?s presence serves almost less as a performance than a key to Britney?s intentions: as Madonna did on albums such as Erotica , Ray of Light, and Music, she?s out to bend current trends to her needs. R. Kelly, Moby, and Ying Yang Twins all provide stirring moments that draw on everything from Bollywood to Southern hip-hop, while one of the most impressive tracks, &quot;Touch of My Hand,&quot; joins the proud tradition of Cyndi Lauper?s &quot;She Bop.&quot; She still lacks a fully formed artistic vision of her own, but Zone, with its many get-free anthems, puts her much closer.
B0000D96NW|5.0|Yes. This is the cd I expected after The More Things Change. Finally one of my favortie bands has said \\"To hell with this nu metal crap lets kick ass again.\\" Through the Ashes of Empires is an excellent metal album with some of the best Machine Head songs I've heard in years.Imperium starts off the album and kicks you right square in the testicles as it slowly ascends and then goes balls out with old school thrash breakdowns remniscent of old Testament or Slayer. With tracks like \\"Days turn Blue to Grey\\" and \\"All Falls Down\\" they have shown forward progression with their songwriting as a band and Robert Flynn showcases his excellent clean vocals and shows he can do more than just bark his lyrics .(although there is a fair amount of screaming in this album as well)This cd won't leave your cd player for months take it from me a true metal fan. don't listen to posers like JcTravesty from Grandview, Wa. This guy is probably a humongous poser who has all of the Ill Nino albums and has his hair braided and wears mascara and ultimatley if he likes \\"The burning Red\\" ( Machine Heads worst album) then he doesn't really know crap about good music.Five stars Kiss my ass J.C.

B000002H33|5.0|Okay, let me just reiterate: This is a landmark album!  This is essential Thrash!  Yes, yes, most Metallica fans agree with those two statements.  The only disagreement arises when discussing which album is their best.  Some prefer the outstanding energy issued forth on their previous album, &quot;Ride the Lightning.&quot;  While others prefer their more Progressive Metal from &quot;...And Justice for All.&quot;  Many others think their &quot;Black Album&quot; is the pinnacle of their output.  But I think &quot;Master of Puppets&quot; takes the best elements from those albums and in one fantastic Thrash fantasy it all comes together seemlessly.  This album has nearly the same energy level from &quot;Ride the Lighting,&quot; has the band venturing into Progressive Metal with spectacular results a la &quot;...And Justice for All,&quot; and while none of their albums ever reached the superb production value of the &quot;Black Album,&quot; &quot;Master of Puppets&quot; comes very close.  All four band members are playing at an inspired level on &quot;Master of Puppets.&quot;  James Hetfield churns out some excellent riffs and offers up some genuine intensity with his vocal performance; Kirk Hammett comes up with some of the best lead guitar work of his heralded career; Lars Ulrich is an infectious Drum God here, affecting every headbanger in listening range into a fit of unbridled air-drumming; while Cliff Burton(R.I.P.) drives every riff home with his masterful playing.  The chemistry these four show on every song here is magnificent!  The one under-appreciated facet of these songs are the lyrics.  Every song here has memorable lyrics, except &quot;Orion,&quot; which is, of course, an instrumental.  Here are some examples:<br />BATTERY: Smashing through the boundaries/Lunacy has found me/<BR>         Cannot stop the Battery<br />MASTER OF PUPPETS: Master of Puppets I'm pulling your strings/<BR>                   Twisting your mind and smashing your dreams<br />THE THING THAT SHOULD NOT BE: Not dead which eternal lie/<BR>                              Strangers eons Death may die<br />WELCOME HOME(SANITARIUM): Whisper things into my brain/<BR>                          Assuring me that I'm insane<br />DISPOSABLE HEROES: Soldier boy, made of clay, now an empty shell/<BR>                   Twenty-one, only son, but he served us well<br />LEPER MESSIAH: Witchery, weakening/Sees the sheep are gathering/<BR>               Set the trap, hypnotize/Now you follow<br />DAMAGE, INC.: Living on your knees, conformity/<BR>              Or dying on your feet for honesty<br />I especially love the lyrical referrences to H.P. Lovecraft on the song &quot;The Thing That Should Not Be.&quot;  Referrences to &quot;Crawling Chaos&quot; and the &quot;Old Ones&quot; are highlights for me; as is the above lyric.  There are many Heavy Metal bands influenced by the Gothic Horror stories of H.P. Lovecraft.  Even the cover of Iron Maiden's album &quot;Live After Death&quot; has a Lovecraft quote on the headstone.  If you are at all interested in his writings, &quot;The Best of H.P. Lovecraft: Bloodcurdling Tales of Horror and the Macabre&quot; is an excellent place to start.  But there I go flying off on a tangent...  &quot;Master of Puppets&quot; is an excellent album filled with memorable songcraft, excellent production, and fine performances from the entire band.  Thank you for reading my review.

B000031WD9|3.0|I was reluctant to see &quot;American Pie&quot;, because every time I heard the name of the movie, I really was hearing &quot;just another lame teen movie&quot; or another &quot;Animal House&quot; wannabe, or the &quot;Porky's&quot; of my generation, but worse. Well, one day I had nothing to do, so I decided to watch it. I was very surprised by &quot;American Pie&quot; because the movie is actually funny.<br />&quot;American Pie&quot; does have some elements that could have contributed to make another silly movie, like the gross-out humor, the usual share of T&A, the fouled language, in few words, the typical ingredients of a cheap teen movie.<br />But &quot;American Pie&quot; has key elements that set the movie apart from its predecessors: the cast is kinda charismatic, some of these actors and actresses will be lost in oblivion and others will be famous, but it's hard to deny that these cast is funny and sure they had fun while they were filming &quot;American Pie&quot;. Special mention to Eugene Levy, he brings the wisdom of a veteran, and mixes very well with the young newcomers, of course, he steals every scene that he appears on.<br />The girls in this kind of movies usually are attractive, and thankfully (for the guys, at least) &quot;American Pie&quot; has pretty girls like Tara Reid, Alyson Hannigan, Shannon Elizabeth and Mena Suvari, not all these girls have real acting talent, but at least in &quot;American Pie&quot; they got the work done. <br />On the other hand, this original &quot;American Pie&quot; movie is the only one truly worthy in the series. I'm sure there are a lot of fans of the second and third movies, but the most demanding audiences will agree that the only decent &quot;American Pie&quot; movie, is this one, the original.
B00001QGPS|5.0|Indeed. I do not like rap music much at all.

I almost threw it away in their face. But i restrained, and even better, listened to it front to back. It seemed that the almighty god himself turned my head... I could not bleieve my ears.... Rap music that sounds good? How is this possible? I would consider this one of the sigle strongest cd's in my collection of strong cd's..... and the only rap cd i own.... Make no mistake... i listened to many many albums after this perticular one that did not involve these two artists.... and they all were as i figured rap to be.... this is THE gem of rap music.

B000002LQR|5.0|I am a Chili Peppers fan and I'd have to say this album exemplifies their best work. It is true that many of the songs might sound similar but only similar in style; not copying the same rythmic ideas over and over. While Mother's Milk was a good album as well, I think the band's sound matured. On Mother's Milk you find songs that are a bit more complicated, with faster and more intense solos from Frusciante and Flea and John using more distortion. On this album however, Frusciante uses distortion sparingly and keeps it on clean tone most of the time.<BR>This allows for more development of the songs. You can hear that Frusciante and Flea wrote their parts together with the bass and guitar parts interwined to almost form one voice. Listening to tracks like the \\"Give it Away\\" you hear how during the verse, the bass starts a measure with a slide from A to G on beats 1 and 2 and then Frusciante's funky guitar part completing the measure on beats 3 and 4 with a chromatic descent E-D#-D. The album has a considerable variety with great acoustic tracks like \\"Breaking the Girl\\" and \\"I Could Have Lied\\". For the reviewer who said RHCP was ripping another one of their songs , \\"Soul to Squeeze\\" (yes a very good song) , Blood Sugar,Sex,Magik was released in 91 and Soul to Squeeze not till 93. The only thing I don't care for are some of Anthony's blatantly sexual lyrics on tracks like Sir Psycho Sexy, but the music is still superb. Flea shows why he is considered such a good bass player not by showing off with fast solo stuff but by writing bass parts that fit perfectly with the guitar parts. It is clear that on this album the band stressed more on getting a complete band sound more so than just writing the most complicated/show off stuff they could pull off.<BR>If you are a metal head, you'll be craving the crazy fast and seemingly complicated riffs you so love  and listening to this album you wont get them. By this time Frusciante had matured enough as a guitar player to be writing far more interesting guitar parts. <BR>but...anyways...Just listening to how good Chad, John, and Flea play together is good enough to give the album five stars.

0792164903|5.0|Tim Burton's films, often praised for the intensity of their mood, bring with them a glimpse of the darker side of the human psyche.  His characters are often dis-jointed, dark, but at their core, always human.  Often, his films are as centrally located around an individual, quite often the title role of the story....such examples include the title characters of films like \\"Edward Scissorhands, Jack Skellington of \\"A Nightmare Before Christmas\\", and Bruce Wayne in \\"Batman\\".  It is his central character that the story seems to evolve around, and it is often seen from that perspective, providing the audience a narrative thread that they can relate to throughout the film.  The same is true of \\"Sleepy Hollow\\".<br />Loosely based on \\"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\\" by Washington Irving, Burton's \\"Hollow\\" is seen from the perspective of Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp (formerly seen in Burton's \\"Edward Scissorhands\\")), a New York detective/criminal investigator who is sent to the farming community of Sleepy Hollow to investigate the decapitations of several of the local townsfolk.<br />Burton weaves elements of the original \\"Legend of Sleepy Hollow\\" into his story, while creating backstory to further develop all the characters, from the families in Sleepy Hollow, to Ichabod Crane, even to the Horseman himself, centralizing the narrative of this story around Crane's investigation into the murders.   While in Sleepy Hollow, Crane quickly learns of a conspiracy that seems to exist amongst the principals of the townfolk.  With the aid of Young Masbeth (Marc Pickering), whose father was murdered by the Horseman, and Katrina Anne Van Tassel (Christina Ricci), Depp's love interest and daughter of the town's acting governor, Crane's investigation quickly leads him on a hunt that will take them to the very heart of evil, as they learn the fate of the Horseman, a Hessian Mercenary sent to fight in the American Revolution before falling to the sword when betrayed by two mysterious little girls many years before.<br />Filled with rich imagery, lavishly created special effects, and plenty of genuine frights, \\"Sleepy Hollow\\" promises to bring thrills, chills, and plenty of scares.  Moreover, though, the story uses horror to aid the story, not replace it.  Unlike so many horror movies released in the past ten years, Hollow does not rely on gore to create thrills, but instead, (as with most of Burton's work), it uses subtle mood, growing tension and human vulnerability to really bring the story home in a way that is both terrifying and immensely engaging.<br />Rated R for violence, gore and brief sexuality, this is not a film for the young.  However, for anyone looking for a good scare with a great story, this is the film for you.  (NOTE: This film is a departure from the original story by Irving.)
B00003CXXS|3.0|Being a lifelong Dinosaur fan, I had to check out JP///. The trailers were making the movie seem really big and fresh with bringing Spinosaurus in to replace Tyrannosaurus as the starring role as super-predator in the JP series. The film moves at a pretty fast rate which can be good and bad. The Dinosaurs in the film are more believable now that the CGI programmers had the ability to make the Dinos' skin wobble when they moved and to have other parts of their body be in sync with the rest of their body. <BR>The characters really don't have much development in the film which is okay considering you came to see Dinosaurs. But there is just enough character development for the moviegoer to understand each character. <BR>My only gripes are with the film that it just seemed like the Dino action seemed to go downhill as the movie progressed. It starts off very well with the Spinosaurus attacking the plane and then eventually battling Tyrannosaurus (which I was hoping wouldn't show up until the final minutes of the film, giving it a climatic ending). After that, the Dinos seemed kinda sparse and the action shorter and shorter. The raptors also kinda got old. Like with T-rex, the filmmakers should have replaced the raptors with other Dinos. Maybe Baryonyxs? Also some science is forgotten in this film. But they had Jack Horner as their Dino supervisor, so it was a given some wrenches would be thrown in the mix. Also, the film seemed really short. With some newer dinos added to the screen that have never been seen before, I was hoping that they would have some pretty nifty Dinosaur battle sequences and Dinosaur-human encounters. <BR>All in all, while JP/// was, somewhat, of a letdown for me, it still provided the goods for the most part.

B00005JKG9|5.0|Exaggeration &amp; Repetition: Performance keys to live by<br />There are two keys to being a good performer, whether you are writing or telling a story, whether you are selling something or selling yourself: Always exaggerate things by one thousand percent, and use repetition at least 500 percent. <br />Those who understate a story or product that may not be very strong in the first place, will fall victims to making that story or product look weak. The way to avoid making yourself or whoever/whatever you are representing look weak is to follow the aforementioned keys. The way to do that when the product or story is weak is to learn how to \\"B.S.\\" That is where being a good performer comes in... <br />You are an actor, and being outgoing and to the extreme will always give the impression that whatever you are talking about is \\"the best.\\" A good actor can do this perfectly and not come off as overly co.cky or obnoxious. Always say what the other person wants to hear. The customer is always right. Do whatever you can to \\"nail the gig.\\" <br />There is something else to keep in mind when doing this particular form of \\"B.S.-ing,\\" and that is the \\"K.I.S.S.\\" method of \\"keep-it-simple-stupid.\\" That may sound like a contradiction to the keys, but it is not. Keeping it simple, is not disclosing the real specifics, but still making your case sound like it's above and beyond every other possible option. This comes in handy particularly when someone asks you a question that you may not know the full answer to. That is where \\"filling\\" comes in---something that students do when writing an English essay on a test. If you have a general idea of what you want to say but don't have a specific reply to a portion of the question, you \\"fill\\" that essay with long winded run-on sentences. However, the whole thing must be coherent, and if your essay is well-written and has a good amount of clever puns and humor, you cannot lose. If you are a slick actor or writer, you can fool even the bestof English teachers into at least giving you an \\"E\\" for effort. <br />Another thing to keep in mind is that you will never lose if you can \\"meet in the middle.\\" What that means is this: Suppose a shirt looks like it is worth $15 to a customer but you build it up so much and make it sound like it's worth $50... By the end of the conversation, if you are doing your job, you are going to get them to meet you in the middle and the final conclusion will be that the price of the shirt is around $25. The real worth may be no more than $15 (and maybe even less), and certainly nowhere near $50, but you still get the \\"E\\" for effort and earn $25. You aren't really getting into details on why the shirt is worth so much more than the customer thinks, but you are pounding it into their head that it's worth $50. You are exaggerating and repeating. You are using adjectives that may or may not apply to that shirt but you are making it sound great and far above what it's worth. So finally, they will concede a price of $25. You were stretching the truth about the shirt being worth $50 and they may have been undervaluing it at $15. Essentially, you are both lying and both playing a game with one another, but finally, a minimum of $25 is agreed upon. No one may ever find out the true value, but it's irrelevant anyway. This works in any situation.<br />Exaggeration and repetition. But remember to K.I.S.S. <br />These keys could have been discussed in one paragraph, but it took an entire page, yet you as the reader were compelled to hang onto each word from start to finish. So I succeeded as a writer in that this essay was read from start to finish and my point was proven.<br />The \\"Whale\\"<br />A whale is a customer that you pull in, hook, line and sinker and mount on the wall. He is a golden nugget, a superstar, a monster. This type of customer that you get lucky enough to snag will be your customer for life. That means, you will either be set up for life from one deal you strike up oryou will have him as a repeat customer that you can call back as a strong possible prospect forever. <br />Sometimes it is tough to spot a whale, he may not always be overly outgoing or obvious about being a \\"buyer.\\" So anyone can be a whale. The way to learn if someone is a whale or not is to simply get into their home and learn about their life and about them. So anything you can do to get your foot in the door will work. <br />Start off small and discuss something that may appeal to their interest and work your way into their world. Don't pre-judge them until you learn about them. This will take time and patience, but all you need is a small \\"in\\" and then you can build on that and if you win the whale's trust, all it takes is one big deal to set you up for life. <br />So practice the \\"A.B.C.\\" method of \\"always be closing\\" with everyone, because anyone can be a prospect. While the impression may be given that you genuinely care about them, the main objective is getting them to sign on the dotted line. <br />Of course the obvious \\"Gordon Gecko\\" type whales who go around showboating their spending habits and their skills are the true whales that if you are lucky enough to somehow snag, you are set.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|with her first album, yes it was great. but very pop style. but with the comming of her new album, the songs are darker and edgier and it makes the songs stand out more. they are very catchy. I still have alot of songs stuck in my head. she is an Excellent song writer.Both albums are delightful to have.you are a fool to think it is not a great album. Many people think shes a poser. but shes not. shes just tryin to be who she is and do what she wants to do. Poser is just a word for the people who wants to hate on another. Avril is not a poser and she is a damn good writer, and music performance. This album was awesome. i go to sleep listening to it because i rather listen to it than anything on the stereo. i give major props to Avril! Buy the Album!
B0002234LS|4.0|A lot of other reviewers of this movie seem to have missed the point.  They are dealig with what they THOUGHT the movie was going to be, or should have been, and that's not the point, people.  Deal with what the movie IS.<br />It's a Hitchcockian psychological thriller.  That means that you actually have to think about people's motivations and feelings, and consider them in terms of the larger context.  I'm not giving away any spoilers here, so I can't be too specific, but if you've seen the movie, then you know why Mort can't run away from Shooter (a question one reviewer had, along with wondering why Mort wouldn't have realized the truth right off the bat).  The answer to those two questions ought to be obvious to nayone who actually paid attention.<br />If you haven't seen the movie and are considering getting it, here's what I've got to say: (1) it's NOT a horror movie, and is in no way scary, only a little creepy and morbid, but definitely not scary, so don't buy it if that's what you're looking for; (2) Depp is absolutely brilliant, although that can't come as much of a surprise; (3) the pace is fairly slow, and there is not a great deal that &quot;happens&quot; -- this is a movie composed of lovingly rendered little moments, as opposed to overblown big moments like car chases or fistfights; (4) the DVDs special features are excellent, including a very informative and enlightening commentary track and a solid hours' worth of documentary, and this material should spell out very explicitly the themes and concerns of the filmmakers if you are left wondering by the film what they were; (5) as far as imitation Hitchcock goes, this is pretty good.  That's about the best I can offer on the subject, guys.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|This CD sucks and is a complete waste of time. The s/t and Iowa were pretty tight, but Slipknot not only failed to write good music, they actually managed to write one of the worst CD's of 2004. Altogether its got like one or two good songs. If you like Slipknot, this is not the CD for you, if you don't like Slipknot, good, this will give you more of a reason to hate them. Hopefully they will come back with a vengeance after Stone Sour's stint is done.
B000002HD5|5.0|The Whigs are one of those groups that takes some getting used to. At least they did for me. The music is so unlike the other stuff that finds its way into the mainstream. Not that this group ever really did. The title track on this album did peak its head into the mainstream for a short time, and then the Afghan Whigs sunk back into obscurity, sadly. It makes sense when you think about it. The Whigs lacked a lot of the traits that make for superstardom, great singing, catchy hooks, and simple chord progressions over 4/4 beats, to name a few.<br />I think the main thing that made the Whigs so unique and compelling was the shuffling of the traditional instrumental roles for a rock band. The bass often flies around wherever it pleases with apparent disregard for the demands of the song. It takes more of a lead guitar role, sometimes even going against the grain of the music with atonal melodies. The guitars and keys therefore have to compensate by sticking tight with the rhythm. But they don't just stick to it, they embrace it, often with repetitive but piercing hooks that leave an ache in your heart. The drums are brilliant and complex, and Greg Dulli's voice is like a rusty knife. He can't really sing but somehow this only adds to what the music is conveying: the darker corners of Greg Dulli's life.<br />Gentlemen is the apex of the Afghan Whigs output, and it stands as one of my all time favorites. It's quite possibly the darkest most moving cd in my collection. Unfortunately, although the Afghan Whigs produced many albums, none but this one is consistently good. If you really like Gentlemen though, there are some gems here in there amongst their other material.
B00005JMEW|4.0|I like this movie cause there was alot of action. An it has a plot that will keep you going. Although there was alot of blood and cheesy killing scenes I would rate it 4 star.
B00000253N|5.0|It's hard to find sufficient words to describe this album, but 'masterpiece' is certainly a good start. Blood On The Tracks simply has no weak points, but simply a series of peaks. Even for a casual Dylan fan (like myself), this is an essential disc. This was my first Dylan record when I bought it on vinyl back in 1975, after hearing 'Tangled Up In Blue' on the radio. But I was captivated by the rest of the record, especially 'Lilly, Rosemary..', 'Shelter From The Storm', 'Twist Of Fate' and 'Buckets Of Rain'. It's now the first Dylan record I bought on CD, and the re-mastering sounds great!
B0001ZX0PG|5.0|This may very well be Clint Eastwood's masterpiece. The story told through unforgettable imagery is mesmerizing and leaves the viewer's mind in a subterfuge of disturbing what-if images. This is a downbeat yet powerful soul-searching parable of anyone who ever must face cryptic circumstances, memories and destiny. Tim Robbins, Sean Penn, and Kevin Bacon are truly extraordinary in their roles. Tim Robbins showed greater depth as an actor than I ever thought possible. He was entirely believable and convincing. His performance was just heartbreaking. Sean Penn's performance was brilliant. Under his tough-guy persona lurked a man of compassion yet one who could not give up his eye-for-an-eye upbringing. Kevin Bacon gave a stoic performance of a man who could not yet comprehend his past experiences and put them in perspective, nor could he admit to what was evident in his present challenge because he was blinded by the past. This is a very moving film and one that lingers with you.
B000001EHS|5.0|Def Leppard is the kind of band my older brother makes a face about.  Probably not the band you want to mention when you?re trying to impress people with your musical savvy.  Call them a guilty pleasure, though, cause they sure are fun to listen to!  MTV hits 'Pour Some Sugar' and 'Rocket', certainly rock, along with classics 'Armageddon It' and 'Rock Of Ages'.  But listening to this disc really underscores the band's strengths as pioneers of the power ballad.  From 'Bringin' On The Heartbreak' to 'Two Steps Behind', and even 'Foolin?, these guys master the form.  Vault provides a great overview of the pre 1995 works.
B0001MDP3G|5.0|This 2-disc presentation of director Anthony Minghella's COLD MOUNTAIN is very impressive. COLD MOUNTAIN is an interesting and somewhat engrossing low-key story of the Southern home front and one man's fight to return from the battlefield in this romantic Civil War tale. The story ranges from romantic imagery to a sense of mysticism in its telling. The initial focus is set in the Confederate fortifications around Petersburg. This Civil War action here is brief but impresses the viewer with its imagery depicting the Battle of Petersburg, better known as the &quot;battle of the crater,&quot; in 1864. The film then focuses on the climatic convergence of its central characters. This is a film that truly relies on its juxtaposition of panoramic and intimate images to convey the emotion of its story. Jude Law's stoic and purely visual performance is very effective to the success of this fairytale-like and highly impressionistic film. The detailed &quot;Climbing Cold Mountain&quot; documentary that is approximately 70 minutes in length and &quot;A Journey to Cold Mountain&quot; which is an interesting making-of featurette make this DVD a must-have for admirers of this film. Also, the &quot;Scared Harp History&quot; documentary, which explores the musical influences and origins used in the film is quite fascinating and shows the integral part that music plays in historical films of this kind. I found this film to be more effective now that I have seen it again on this wonderful DVD.

1592400876|5.0|I'm one of those people who cringes when someone uses incorrect grammer, whether it's punctuation or the word \\"less\\" instead of \\"fewer\\".  I can't help it.  There is a part of me that is driven nuts by all the punctuation and Grammar misusage I find when I'm reading books, magazines, and other media, especially the web!     I haven't sat down and read the entire book from cover-to-cover, but I have probably done enough spot reading to have read most of it.      I absolutely LOVE this book.  It is hilarious and educational at the same time.  If schools used a teaching method based on this book, I think everyone would love learning about punctuation. (...and remember what they learned!)    Now, will someone PLEASE write a Grammar book that is just as funny and educational??!!??
630027179X|3.0|The Arthur story has been told and retold in dozens of ways. Some (like Mists of Avalon) give a unique perspective, others emphasize the character drama, yet others apply the newest effects to the story.<br /><br />This version, though competent enough, never seemed to find itself. It has good action, reasonable interprtations of characters, and a generally high standard of craftsmanship. When the story is as familiar as Arthur et al., it takes something more for a movie to become memorable.<br /><br />It's exciting and it's watchable. It just has nothing to put it ahead of other versions of the Arthur story.<br /><br />//wiredweird
B00006CXXU|4.0|This Cd is actually kinda or boring and exciting at the same time.  Boring, because there are a lot of songs that are just there, nothing to spectacular, besides her singles.  But exciting because her voice and her lyrics are amazing, you can tell she has a lot of passion in her music.  And even though i think her Genie in A Bottle Albulm was better, i would recommend this to people who are fanatics of Christina.

This time the pied piper is a scam and the group is led by a talking cat who is in cahoots with the rats!  This book has been portrayed as a children's book, but is still a perfect discworld novel for adults. There are the usual stupid bad guys and  characters that just do not seem to get the larger picture.  This book examines the develpoment of society from hunter gatherer to working together and the rise of writing.  The rats are borrowed from \\"Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH\\".  The book also has a take on the \\"Rat King\\" which is unique and fun.  This is a good way to start chilren on Terry Pratchett of for their parents to be introduced to a true modern master at work.  Highly Recommended.

0385486804|4.0|How does a young man leave a comfortable life with an education and well to do parents and just wander into the wild?  This is one of the questions that Jon Krakauer tries to answer.  At first the reader is given the idea that Chris McCandless read one too many books like &quot;On the Road&quot; or &quot;White Fang&quot;, but as the story develops, he becomes more complex a character.  This young man was looking for adventure and decided to leave &quot;normal&quot; life behind.  Unfortanuatly for him. it cost him his life.<br />Krakauer does an amazing job of bringing McCandless back to life by trying to show what he was thinking.  Krakauer used personal notes, interviews with family and friends and historical experiences to flesh out this person.  When the personal notes run out and speculation starts, Krakauer gives a personal tale to explain why McCandless was not an idiot and just had some bad luck.  This book is a very good read and is time well spent.
B0001NBMBC|4.0|One of the most (controversial? touchy? or just debated?) subjects in the world of metal is whether or not a band is numetal or really METAL.  It seems that any band that is borderline mainstream-popular or -friendly that features heavily distorted guitar and/or screaming vocals is widely argued to be metal or not.  Perhaps the currently most popular of these is Slipknot.<br />I, personally, do not consider Slipknot to be metal.  However, this does NOT mean I don't - or can't - like them.  It's the same reason I like KoRn, Static-X, and even the newest phase in the legendary (and now infamous) Metallica: if I like it, I like it.  If only more people could think like this (hope that didn't sound too arrogant!).<br />When I first heard their self-titled debut album back in the early spring of 2001, I simply could not believe what I was hearing.  Until then, the only music I had listened to that was even remotely metal was KoRn and Godsmack (and maybe a couple other bands; I honestly don't remember).  Hearing something so, well, intense and loud was truly addictive to me.  I loved, savored, every minute of it.  As time grew on, I began to explore other bands, including Metallica, Flaw, and Cold, and eventually I would discover a certain band called Iced Earth, who would change how I viewed music forever (for more on this, read my &quot;So You'd Like to... Learn About Me&quot; guide).  Somewhere during this time period, however, I picked up IOWA.  As much as I enjoyed it (and I still consider it to be better than the debut), I quickly overlooked it as I began to check out the wonders of progressive metal and melodic death metal.  I suppose that will change now, because VOL. 3: THE SUBLIMINAL VERSES is, without a doubt, Slipknot?s best album to date (at least to all non-?maggots?).<br />I won't get into the exact why's and why-not's of my opinion of Slipknot's distinct characteristics that make them not metal, because I'm sure it would enrage many a &quot;maggot&quot; out there.  HOWEVER, I *will* discuss what has improved in this band since their fairly bland debut, and why this album, much like IOWA, is certainly a noteworthy (albeit overlooked and underrated) effort from a numetal band.<br />If I've ever had a real problem with Slipknot, it was their &quot;wanking.&quot;  By this I mean their usual inclusions of programming, electronics, turntables, and extra drumming.  These extra instruments usually provide nothing more than bombastic &quot;cheese,&quot; which was their biggest problem.  I mean seriously, if they wanted to have so much drumming in their music, why not get a drummer that could make much of this noise on their own?  With all this &quot;wanking,&quot; Slipknot proved that they didn't just not NEED the extra effort; it showed something of a weakness which required a mask (no pun intended) to cover it up.<br />However, with IOWA, Slipknot began to show improvements by toning down their hammish excesses and just rocking.  Now, on VOL. 3, they have gotten so much better; the majority of songs on here, while still fairly immature, have very controlled usage of programming and extra drumming - perhaps producer Rick Rubin's influence.<br />In other aspects, Slipknot has often been far too SIMPLE.  The drumming, the bass, and (good lord) the guitars have always been very dry, and served little more purpose than noise in their flurry of, well, MORE noise.  However, on VOL. 3, the guitars have improved considerably.  While Jim Root and Mick Thompson are still far from great, they have been practicing, and it shows on some of the tracks outlined below.<BR> <BR>Their riffs are certainly far more interesting; they incorporate good melodies, and often have little feedback hooks that add more of a metallic (note: I did NOT say metal) edge to their ever de-tuned sound.  Just listen to the popular single &quot;Duality&quot; and hear it for yourself; the riffs are not just chunks of distorted garbage, they're really RIFFS!<br />Aswell, Jim &amp; Mick really prove surprising because...THEY HAVE LEADS NOW!  On the intro to &quot;On &quot;Welcome,&quot; there is a brief shred of notes that while very simple compared to (most) other guitar leads, still counts as a solo.  Wonder of wonders...a numetal band doing a guitar solo.  There is another one on &quot;Vermillion,&quot; but it is far more the typical numetal lead, depending largely upon feedback and pedals/effects (this is Godsmack's usual quandary).  &quot;Pulse of the Maggots,&quot; also include some leads.  Nonetheless, the fact that Slipknot is incorporating more than just riffs in their music is quite a feat.<br />Also, the acoustic guitar on &quot;Circle&quot; was quite a shift from Slipknot's usual bag of tricks; in fact, the entire song is acoustic, with only minor extra instrumental input to heighten a somewhat pained mood, the only &quot;wanking&quot; being the programmed drumming towards the end.  &quot;Vermillion, Pt. 2&quot; is a straight-out ballad, again with acoustic guitars and programming which serves only as background texture flowing comfortably as Corey Taylor croons with his long-hidden talent of singing.<br />Corey Taylor's contributions to the band are also somewhat noteworthy.  It seems that in his time of playing with his old band of Stone Sour rubbed off a bit; he certainly sings a lot more here, and not every song has a curse placed in every other word.  He can still scream impressively enough, but he's gotten better overall.  Lyrics are still fairly...odd and/or angry, which perhaps won't ever change.<br />Finally, I've heard from Corey Taylor in some interview at one point or another that there was a song that was supposed to be &quot;King Crimson meets Pink Floyd.&quot;  I'll just state for the record (no pun intended) that there is NOTHING remotely like this on this album.  If Slipknot wants to consider themselves progressive, then yes, they have progressed, but the extent of their progression only goes as far as furthering their maturity since their debut.  While still not metal, Slipknot has improved.<br />Oh, and I hardly care about the masks/jumpsuits gimmick.  That is an image they use for their visual publicity, and as such has nothing to do with their most important feature: their music.<br />Slipknot, you get a B+.  Not bad.
0345457684|5.0|What a wonderful little book this turned out to be! Morgan starts off with the 'mind as information' idea that is so liked by modern SF authors, and spins it into a clever and surprising detective novel that hits all the right buttons.<br />Yeah, the SF concepts are cool, but what's really nice about this novel is the pulp detective novel it contains. In that regard, SF and Noir perfectly complement each other and prevent the novel from ever devolving into something derivative. The SF concepts are good, but as fuel material for a detective story, they allow Morgan to give a 'classical' detective narrative in an entirely new light, in a world populated by 300 year-old megalomaniacs and where your body is just one form of very expensive suit.<br />The fact the novel played out like a very classic detective story is one of the reasons I found it so endearing: there were moments, throughout the books, when I just KNEW what was gonna happen, but like seeing a remastered version of your favorite classic, that's a good thing: it was still entirely worthwhile.<br />Altogether, what truly makes 'Altered Carbon' memorable is not the SF, though it is amazing, and not the detective story, though it is an absolute delight to read: it's the perfect balancing act between the two, a mix of genres I have rarely seen executed so well.
B00005JMUA|5.0|The Kill Bill series is a real masterpiece.  This review counts for both movies.  They are both very entertaining works of art.  The action is brutal and great, the story is excellent, the performances are total bad a$$, the drama is great, overall this is the greatest revenge movie ever, and is also Tarantino's best so far, i hope he continues making movies until his sad sad death. Quentin is the man.
1573229725|3.0|What to say... It's the most grueling reading experience I've ever had. Seems like one picks up the book and invisible shackles bound you to it until you reach the long awaited last page. I'm not kidding. Yes, it's delicious in narration and socio-historical context but the story... it's so overly dramatic... I read and read until a lot of people got even mad. Only to find that the story, not the research, not the Victorian narrative, not the invocation of Charles Dickens, the story, the base -would be as queerly convoluted as a soap opera of today. Sometimes even erratic, leaving one thinking, that's not a probable reaction/development albeit one can clearly see the benefit it pays to the author's schemes.<br />The problem with that is that a good story should make us forget that it is a ventriloquism show what we paid to read... (figure of speech). That's paramount, not the tiresome formulaic aproaches to build up expectations in the reader. The end is most unsatisfying considering all this author puts us through.<br />However, kudos to her for writing it and putting out there something much more enjoying than the horrible typical mainstream lesbian fiction of today.
B0001BKAEY|5.0|Critics know absolutly nothing.  The entire matrix trilogy is a landmark in the action movie genre.  The story cant be beat, the action will never be beat, the f/x are amazing, the perfomances are good, overall the matrix trilogy are the best 3 sci fi action movies ever.  This one is probably the best, but the action in reloaded is a little better, except for the last fight between neo and smith which is the best fight in the trilogy.  Worth owning all of them, 10 out of a 10.  Action meets perfection in these movies.
B0001ZX0PG|4.0|Timothy Robbins and Sean Penn earn their Oscars in this one. Both play shady type people who are tarnished by the rough environment they grew up in...on the wrong side of the tracks in Boston.   I found myself feeling very sorry for the characters and the deep holes they are digging for themselves in their lives.  The films underlying message, I think, is that no human life is unimportant, no matter how messed up that life happens to be.  Another message, sometimes things go terribly wrong and there is little anyone can do to change what fate has in store.  A scary movie, but well dome by Clint Eastwood!!!
B00008973Q|1.0|This movie is terrible.  I bought it expecting a good action epic with lots of battles and sword fights.  There are no battles there are 2 massacres where all that happens is &quot;samurai&quot; with guns? shoot each other and women. samurai dont have guns.  The story was good but they ruined it with 2 hours and 30 mins of talking on and on about the same topic over and over, yak yak yak.  There is no drama the characters dont develope except for the old guy who just walks around starring and goes crazy.  The perfomances are the same in everyone, yelling even when there happy, and they all sound the same even the women.  No action, no drama, nothing except talk and fake blood from the stupid shooting, not swords, guns, What?  Very bad movie, I was dissapointed, greatly.  I would give 0 stars but they dont let me.
B0001L3MI0|4.0|Finally, science fiction the way it used to be: rousing, cosmically  xenophobic and ferociously patriotic. Forget E.T. and his cuddly ilk. INDEPENDENCE DAY's Bellicose aliens want our Earth and intend to squash us like bugs--Bugs!--to get it. It's up to a ragtag band of can-do-Americans, ranging from the President (Bill Pullman) to a druncken crop-duster pilot (Randy Quaid), to rally our spirits and save our bacon.<br />An engaging of second-tier-talent--Jeff Goldblum, Will Smith, Judd Hirsch et al.-- is on hand, and the lack of superstars works to the picture's advantage. Whereas Arnold, Tom or Sly would have to make it out alive, these journey men could bite the dust at any moment, and a surprising number of them do. For once, as a result, something's really at stake in all those white-knuckle suspense scenes.<br />If the writer/directer team of Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich made some engagingly loopy moves in STARGATE, here they play genre convections dead straight and make them work. Thumbnail sketches of the dozen or so principal character are executed quickly and efficiently, so you actually care a little when they're imperled. The aliens, meanwhile are a fabulously nasty lot of slimy, tentacled, malevolent telepaths, but all their superior technology is no match for our red, white and blue.
0307155102|5.0|I owned many Richard Scarry books as a ltitle girl, so I was thrilled when we received several as a gift for my daughter. I introduced this book to her at about 12 months of age, and much to my surprise she immediately became obsessed with the book, the alphabet page in particular. I was so surpised by this, as she normally only has the attention span for interactive/lift-the-flap books, but her attention span regarding this book is a testament to how fabulous it is! In the last 2 months, she has come to like all of the pages, and it is a book she brings me everyday to read to her, turning around and plopping herself down in my lap for a good long read! I myself remember the cozy illustrations, especially the pages of little things and food. The book is loaded with words, opportunities for elaborating and describing in great detail, and in my opinion I think the title suits it well: it is the best word book ever! Don't miss out on this book, especially if you are looking for something to hold your child's attention for longer than 5 minutes!
B00018TI5E|5.0|I love this album, it is totally awesome. Being a fan of John's work with the Chili Peppers, I expected this album to be a funky rock album... boy, was i surprised. <br />From beginning to end this album has a relaxing but mind boggling tone which keeps you attracted to each and every chord John plays. This was the first of John's solo albums i bought, second was To Record Water For Ten Days. That too was great. Now i have all his solo albums.<br />If you're a fan of this album strongly recommend John's other solo albums and also the Brown Bunny Soundtrack which has 5 of John's songs.
B0001906O0|5.0|I have never, ever rated anything on Amazon, but I couldn't wait to review this. If you are a Cure fan, you simply MUST buy this box set! The remastered B-sides alone are worth the money. I can't remember how many times over the years I've longed for a better quality sound than the analog--now you have it. You can finally hear what the undertones are on some songs. Amazing...what a wonderful collection and high quality, I just can't recommend it enough. Get it for yourself or your favorite Cure fan. I PROMISE you you will not regret it!!!!!!!!!!!
B000002I2I|4.0|After two soft, poppy albums in &quot;Waiting For The Sun&quot; and &quot;The Soft Parade,&quot; The Doors returned to their trademark psychedelic rock groove with &quot;Morrison Hotel,&quot; their fifth album released in 1970. This album is not quite as polished sounding as their others, but it is still an enjoyable listen.<br />Take the bluesy and groovy &quot;Roadhouse Blues&quot; that starts the album off. This song is one that should be played in the car while driving down a country road or a highway. It is one of the best road songs around. Robby's guitar is fantastic, and the harmonica was a nice touch in this song.<br />Then check out the very psychedelic and trippy &quot;Waiting For The Sun&quot; (not to be confused with the album of the same name). Robby's guitar and Ray's organ literally sizzle with rich, melodic intensity. Jim Morrision's yell is uncanny and nobody can do it like he does. I love this song because it delivers a combination of free-flowing lyrics and music followed by the heavy, melodic punch.<br />&quot;You Make Me Real&quot; is definitely not one of The Doors' better songs, but it has a catchy groove and a unique beat that along with Jim's rough vocals, makes for quite a rowdy song. &quot;Blue Sunday,&quot; &quot;The Spy&quot; and &quot;Indian Summer&quot; probably qualify as weaker Doors songs as well. &quot;Blue Sunday&quot; is very soft and light with soft crooning from Jim and a soft flowing Ray Manzarek organ. I like Jim's voice here, but it is not one of the better songs. The same with &quot;Indian Summer.&quot; It is almost like the flipside of &quot;Blue Sunday.&quot; It too features soft Morrision crooning and guitar chords from Robby Krieger. &quot;The Spy&quot; is a bit different though. This song is a very soft, shuffling, dragging blues number. I will say that Robby Krieger plays blues guitar exceptionally well, and drummer John Densmore gets to show a bit of his jazz roots. Ray really adds a great touch with the piano.<br />Probably my very favorite song on the album is &quot;Peace Frog.&quot; When The Doors were first doing the &quot;Morrison Hotel&quot; sessions, &quot;Peace Frog&quot; was orignally an instrumental. But then Jim used two of his poems to provide the lyrics needed. All I can say is that this song REALLY puts the groove on. It is the grooviest, danceable song on the album. Robby Krieger's groovy guitar licks, John Densmore's shuffling, stomping drum beats, and Ray's catchy organ chords all come together to make this song superb. And Jim's vocals are fantastic.<br />&quot;Ship Of Fools&quot; and &quot;Land Ho!&quot; kind of go together. Both have the same organ tone, and both are very catchy. &quot;Ship Of Fools&quot; features some nice, swirly organ chords from Ray and powerful Densmore drums. &quot;Land Ho!&quot; features a fantastic Robby Krieger guitar intro that continues through the song that along with Densmore's stuttering, shuffling drum beats, makes this an awesome song. You kind of feel like you're on a ship in the ocean when you hear these two songs. These should be played while sailing or on a boating trip.<br />&quot;Queen Of The Highway&quot; is a fairly fast-paced song with some great Morrison lyrics. This is another good &quot;road song.&quot; It is more of a pure rock song though. <br />&quot;Maggie M'Gill&quot; is not my favorite Doors song by any means, but it really features some nice stomping drum work from John Densmore and some clever guitar hooks from Robby. I think Jim does a great job with the lyrics, but it is not one of their stronger songs. It gets kind of boring after a while because there is not much interesting variety to the song.<br />So with the exception of a few lower grade songs, &quot;Morrison Hotel&quot; is a nice album. First-time Doors listeners may really take to it. It is a nice party album and road-trip album with all those groovy tunes. Very catchy indeed. I don't think many will be disappointed upon purchasing &quot;Morrison Hotel&quot; so I recommended it to all!
0788805843|5.0|When the evil Hades, god of the underworld, learns that if Zeus and Hera's newborn son Hercules fights his world takeover plan, he will fail, Hades' idiotic helpers Pain and Panic kidnap the tyke in an attempt to turn him mortal and kill him. But before baby Herc could drink the last drop of the potion, a middle aged couple intersept. They take young Hercules in and raise him as their own. The only problem Hercules has is his god like strength, which he retained because he did not drink the last drop of the potion.<br />Hercules grows up feeling like he doesn't belong and goes on a journey to find his true identity. When he discovers that he is the son of Zeus, he is told that the only way he can regain entry to Mount Olympus is to become a true hero.<br />So with the help of Phil, a satyr, and Pegasus he begins training to become a hero. He ends up meeting Meg, a young woman who sold her soul to Hades, and falling in love with her. Meg is torn between loyalty to Hades and her growing love for &quot;Wonder Boy&quot;.<br />When Hades strikes a deal with Hercules to give up his strength for 24 hours, Hades frees the Titans to take over Olympus. Due to one technicality in the deal, Hercules regains his strength and defeats Hades. But when he learns of Meg's death, he strikes a deal with Hades to rescue her and take her place in the underworld.<br />A little bit too modern for a story set in Ancient Greece but this movie contains all the essential elements of a true Disney classic.
B0001BKAEY|1.0|I can't believe that this film was made by the same Wachowski brothers who made the (excellent) first Matrix. It plays as if they handed a big wad of money to someone who specialises in brainless action flicks (e.g. starring Van Damm or Vin Diesel or Arnie) and said &quot;here, go and spend this stringing together some cool action sequences, don't worry about logic or continuity at all&quot;.<br />Okay, sure the characters are the same, but the whole style is different. There are far too many repetitive action sequences, e.g. at least 20 closeup shots of Temuera shouting &quot;AAaaaargh!&quot; as he fires round after round of ammo into the sentinels - by the 20th time, I felt like shouting &quot;AAaaaargh!&quot; as well. There was oodles of supposed Matrix &quot;philosophy&quot;, but unlike the first two Matrices, none of it actually made sense, or continued from the structure established by the earlier films!<br />I could attack every minute of this shockingly bad film (every minute was flawed), but here's just one example: In the end, Neo offers peace to the machines, and they accept, letting him back into the matrix to defeat Smith. WHAT?! Did we forget that the machines NEED to keep humanity enslaved as their only source of energy? What the hell is this supposed to mean?<br />Could go on and on, but won't. Matrix Revolutions is crap.
B00003CXCT|4.0|It's sad to see that George Lucas has degenerated into a showman rather than a storyteller. The release of his \\"reworked\\" special edition ignores what the fans really want, and that's for Greedo to not shoot first, for the most part. I'll buy it, of course, but seeing that so many of the special features on the fourth disc are just previews and demos of other products you can buy to fill George Lucas' pockets sickens me.
B0000640RX|4.0|This a great package overall, much better than what is availible here in Australia but the dts/5.1 mix on the first two movies is non existent everything comes through the center channel you get more out of the channels on your surround system by watching them in two channel mix the third movies fine.
B00006EXL5|1.0|My friend Walter really likes My Chemical Romance, well at least I think he does, because he likes Coheed and Cambria and Thursday too.  Walter's really cool but sometimes he creeps me out, he always wears acryllic vampire fangs around school and buys alligator blood off the internet.  I think thats why he likes this album a lot, it really talks about the neo-punk vampire image.  It sounds so mean, it gave me the chills, I think there is some subliminal messages or something because I wanted to be all gawthic right away.  Walter and his friends put on this music when they go for a night on the prowl and our looking for the blood of virgins.  I don't think the music sounds as good when you're at home and aren't participating in any satanic rituals :(.<br />In all seriousness though, this band and it's members really are twats, just like two other bands Sparta and Thursday.  In fact they sound exactly like them except they talk about 'creepy' stuff like vampires.  The cd starts off with lots of bland hardcore and ends with even more bland hardcore or screamo or whatever, except it's all pretentious and striving to be 'evil' sounding.  Track number 3, Vampires Will Never Harm You, may just be the most ridulous track I've heard from a band in the past few years, lines like 'put a stake through me!!' sound like the were written by a comedian making fun of goths on a sketch show.  The lines aren't said tongue in cheek or with and detection of sarcasm so you can't help how the hell could anyone seriously write these off as good lyrics.  Then the band is as misleading as can be, you think you're through with the same old same old hardcore whiny songs when the track 'This is The Best Day Ever' comes on but you're met with another song trying to test a listener's endurance.  This is music for people who just heard Slipknot's latest 'awesome' album and think they should look for some unheard of 'smart' music.  Please avoid.
B000055Y0X|5.0|Every ideology that seems terribly important to one generation usually ends up seeming idiotic and even disturbingly naive to the following generation.<br />Think about it. The ideologies of the 18th century - dying for one's prince, duke or loot - seemed insane during the Napoleonic Wars, when nationalism became THE primary motivating factor. <br />&quot;Pure&quot; nationalism - like the extreme gung-ho attitudes at the beginning of World War I - seemed rather distasteful to the Allied forces in World War II, who fought to liberate peoples from Fascism.<br />The idea that Fascism would always endure, and was seriously in danger of taking over the world, seemed laughable during the Cold War.<br />How does the Cold War look to us today? The McCarthy era; Americans truly believing the USSR and the Communists were veritable Antichrists; truly believing that DESTROYING ALL LIFE ON THE PLANET was a feasible prediction about life in the near future; that the world was, always had been, and always would be, characterised by a fight between Communists and Capitalists.<br />*Sigh*<br />Dr Strangelove (or: how I learned to stop worrying and love the bomb) is actually MORE funny - and disturbing - in some ways now than it was before. Admittedly I can sort of understand the immense impact of this film - could ANY politial satire have been more timely - but the fact that the &quot;better red than dead&quot; ideology nowadays seems as ridiculous as fighting for your Duke, means that this film can be seen in a new light.<br />People actually believed that is was better to be dead than Red? (Yes they did). People actually believed fluoridation of water was a communist conspiracy??? (Yes, they did). The Russians actually contemplated building a Doomsday device? (Yes they did!!! Josef Stalin actually started research on such a device, which would have EXTERMINATED ALL LIFE ON THE PLANET for the sake of a politial dispute between Communist and capitalist that today seems absolutely laughable!)<br />The passing of the Cold War era means that this movie is seriously disturbing. To a new generation, the all-annihilating power of the superpowers of the 1960s appears to have been based on disputes that appear petty in the extreme. Truly this movie makes us wonder what future generations will think of our fixation on modern ideologies; in an era that began three years ago with the late unpleasantness - and which is already making Francis Fukuyama's ideas, from the happy days of the 1990s, seem obsolete. He claimed that history was over; that free market ideology was the ULTIMATE ideology that would finally bring about an end to all future historical events by making us all live in peace.<BR>That is SO 1995...<br />History is not over. Each generation seriously believes its own era is the ultimate era - that their own era is THE era whose disputes TRULY matter.<br />Well, history changes, as Strangelove shows us. I seriously hope that this movie makes us moderns think a little further before considering annihilating the world again! At least over something like fluoridation of water...

B00005ATQ9|5.0|Barry Lyndon is traditionally seen as Stanley Kubrick's weakest film. Yet a certain number of newer reviewers - and Martin Scorsese - are only now beginning to see that this film has been terribly underrated.<br />When I first saw this movie I sided very much with those who believed the film to be pointless eye candy. I couldn't see any point to this movie, which seemed to consist of more or less random events with no real beginning or end, and nothing worth remarking on in between.<br />Of course, years later I began having flashbacks of this movie, and was sorely tempted to buy the DVD, a purchase I finally made (the DVD is very good).<br />&quot;Barry Lyndon&quot; is as much a Greek tragedy as Godfather Part II or the second half of Gone with the Wind. Here Barry Lyndon is trapped by fate, after a series of events set off by aspects of his own character. His very attempts to make himself still richer, towards the end of the film results in an awful mess that is suspiciously reminiscent of Gone with the Wind. I think Margaret Mitchell may possibly have read the novel.(*spoiler!* Hmm, where have I seen a child falling off a horse before?)<br />Barry Lyndon, as a nouveau riche social climber desperately trying to find what we would call &quot;the American Dream&quot; is strangely modern as a figure. The story of his rise and fall is like that of any modern, money-hungry social climber, and is quite relevant to our present world. <br />At any rate, the film is also a masterpiece of atmosphere and style. The care with which the film was made was clearly excruciating, with scenes as carefully plotted out and filmed as any oil painting. Despite Kubrick's reputation as a rather emotionless director, there are plenty of funny scenes. My favourite scenes in this regard are the scenes showing the Chevalier de Balibari playiong cards - the innocent look on his face as he cheats his opponents gets funnier every time you see it. <BR>Of course, there is the famous Schubert Trioscene, where Redmond Barry seduces Lady Lyndon in an incredibly long, slow, but well-timed scene. The movements of eighteenth century aristocrats through their ritualised world is truly as absorbing to watch, as the incredibly slow space pod scenes in Space Odyssey.<br />Of course, there is no Star Gate here; no profundity of theme or mysticism; no deep truths. Barry Lyndon does not try to be as deep as Clockwork Orange, in the same way that Scorsese's Age of Innocence did not aspire to the depth of Taxi Driver. That is not the point. The film could be said to be more style than substance; but in that case it could be said to join Citizen Kane and Blade Runner. It's still damn fine filmmaking.<br />The original novel frankly bears little resemblance to the finished film. (I am reading it now). The novel Barry Lyndon is truly a picaresque novel with a rascally, lively narrator far removed from Ryan O'Neal's very understated portrayal; and in fact the general atmosphere of the book reminded me much more of Oliver Twist or Gulliver's travels than the stately and classy environment of the film. In this respect Kubrick has taken the skeleton of plot from the novel, and laced it with copious amounts of Kubrickian flesh.

B0002858YS|3.0|After hearing the bassline to the opener 'Jenny Was A Friend Of Mine' and the uncanny resemblance to 'Barbarism Begins At Home' by The Smiths, the direction this CD was going to take was already obvious. 'Hot Fuss' by The Killers is taking it's place on the mantle as this years music-press darlings, following in the footsteps of The Strokes and The Darkness, filling the void of the repackaged 'old sound come back again'. The sound is prototypical of the period between late 70's post-punk and early 80's indie/New Wave, influences ranging from Joy Division and The Cure to Modern English and The Psychadelic Furs. Very much in the same vein as Interpol, brooding melodies and brash post-punk riffs, perhaps the only difference being that 'Hot Fuss' has more futuristic sounding synths, eg, Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark and Human League. If anything, this album will appeal to those who were either too young to recognize the recycled retro-sound or have a limited listening vocabulary, but I think it's about time we move-on to something new and fresh. Chances are The Killers will soon be gracing the front pages of music magazines, this years overhyped saviours, overexposed and adored. But I can find the exact same 'indie rock meets bleak synth sound' in many cassettes I threw away a decade or two ago, and there's a reason why I threw them away. I don't wish to undermine those who like (and might potentially like) this album, because there is some degree of talent, creativity and musical prowess. Older sounds will always hold some appeal with a newer audience, but enjoy The Killers while you can, because soon their 15 minutes will be up.
0823003590|5.0|This book is perfect for people with some traditional art training.  It was great fun for me since I have taken sight-size training at the Los Angeles Figurative Academy taught by Adrian Gottlieb. Although I didn't feel like I'd made any progress while I was there, now I realized that those tedious sight-size trainings really were the stepping stone toward drawing well.  This book complements those trainings. If you have sight-sized skills in your pocket, you can easily applied the theory in this book. Now I am able to draw my family members with great accuratecy and artistic expressions. My drawings look like they were done by someone who had been training for years....(actually, it took me three years of searching for the right techniques before I finally found Sight-Sizing). Remember, there is no such thing as instant shortcut to art training.
B00003CXA2|5.0|Thisis my favourite film, and its very easy to say that! very touching and cleverly made. the basic story: a retarded man that pushes his way through life with tragedies blocking his path, but only to pull through them all, the truth is this man has a bigger heart than god. The great thing about this film is the realisation that he is not a very clever guy, and at the start of the film he would seem strange and pathetic, but at the end of the film you will realise that he is an incredible kind, tough and deep man. This is amazing the acting is spot on with a great albanian accent from Hanks no other actor could suit the role better than him. The great thing about this film is that parts of it are action, parts of it are romance and other scenes copntain different things.This film is the best ever you really do need this.
B000294SFW|2.0|I know I'm in the minority on this album, but do you Motorhead fans honestly feel that the songs on Inferno measure up to songs such as \\"Orgasmatron\\", \\"Overkill\\", \\"Shine\\", \\"Ain't My Crime\\", \\"We Are Motorhead\\", \\"One More Time\\", \\"Dr. Rock\\", \\"Iron Fist\\", or \\"I Got Mine\\"? Now before any body doubts my loyalty or honesty as a Motorhead fan, there are plenty of obscure MH songs I can't live without such as Jack the Ripper, Name In Vain, Don't Need Religion, Too Good to be True, Down the Line, Slow Dance, to name a few. I just didn't want anybody thinking the only two songs I listen to are \\"The Game\\" and \\"Ace of Spades\\". So yeah, I do have alot to compare \\"Inferno\\" to. On Inferno: Terminal Show and In the Name of Trajedy are two thrash songs. Well, I'm not really a thrash fan, so to be fair, maybe if I was, I might have given this CD a better rating. I DO recommend these two thrash songs to MH's thrash crowd. Here's where the real problem begins for me: The songs \\"Killers\\", \\"Suicide\\", \\"Life's A Bitch\\", \\"Down On Me\\", \\"Fight\\", \\"In the Year of the Wolf\\" and \\"Smiling Like a Killer\\" seem to have dull, drab singing, and the guitar in the songs is average. Yes, these songs are fast, and they're loud, but just being fast and loud doesn't make every Motorhead song good. Lemmy's singing on these songs is very dull, it doesn't seem to ever change form high to low, or from solo to(very few) harmonies. If you want to know what I mean by what Lemmy is capable of in singing to fast, hard, loud songs, take a listen to cuts such as \\"Ain't My Crime\\", \\"Iron Fist\\", \\"We Are Motorhead\\", \\"Dr. Rock\\", \\"No Voices In The Sky\\", \\"Dr. Love\\" and even the THRASHER \\"Red Raw\\". Two songs that start to show a little more interest to me are \\"In the Black\\" and \\"Keys to the Kingdom\\". \\"In the Black\\" is a mid-tempo one finally starts to show Motorhead getting dirty and gritty again, as you can even hear Lemmy's anger in the song, along with some dirtier guitar. \\"Keys to the Kingdom\\" is a slower one, and does haveLemmy doing some harmony, but even this song seems to drag at parts, and Lemmy sounds at times like he's only half awake when he's singing this. The last song is \\"Whorehouse Blues\\". It's an acoustic, bluesy song. It's OK, but if you want to hear GOOD Motorhead blues, listen to \\"You Better Run\\" or \\"I Ain't No Nice Guy\\". My advice, pick this CD up and support the band. But I'm just letting you know that Motorhead can do MUCH beter than this. It's all documented.
B000002KIE|4.0|This album is cool, it wont appeal to some but its snarly hooks performed by john lydon are enough to get hyou going. A cool proper punk album, still sounds great after these years!!
B0000DZEE3|4.0|This is a concert video, pure and simple. (The only DVD extra is an animated pattern posing as a TV screensaver to be played over several of the live tracks.)<br />As so many of the reviewers confirm, there was nothing like actually being there at Slane Castle on 23rd August 2003. At times on this DVD, the camera pans from the back of the crowd, and you get a good impression of how distant many of the fans were from the stage. They deserve to be given this DVD for free to show them what the band was actually doing, so many hundreds of metres away!<br />Up on the stage, the Chillis were showcasing much of the material from 'By the Way', which is my favourite if not also their best album. Performing as a foursome with no backing musicians, the group are note-perfect. The guitarist and bassist in particular are consummate musicians -- witness their intro to 'Californication'.<br />The only lowlight is the vocalist trying to engage with the crowd by the use of the tired vehicle &quot;Is there anyone here from County Wicklow?&quot; etc etc.<br />Overall, a great souvenir for anyone who was there, and a great advert for anyone thinking about going to a future Chillis gig.

B0001EKZOQ|5.0|This is the question I would like to ask to Mr. Valdes if I have the opportunity.  And I'm sure that he would answer with a &quot;yes&quot;, because music is always changing, because we must be ready for such nice surprises as long as musicians like &quot;Bebo&quot; and &quot;El Cigala&quot; are among us.  My grandparents used to listen to some of these boleros, and because of them I like this music.  Now, I have the chance to listen to them in a different way.  I'm pretty sure that they didn't imagine this deep and marvelous interpretation, and that it's not going to be the last one.
B00000K0DT|5.0|One of the best movies of the 1990s, The Usual Suspects startles and surprises. A fast-paced story told by a wimpy, cripple felon Roger &quot;Verbal&quot; Kint presents a new take on evil, a new face of violence and murder. <br />&quot;You think you can catch Keyser Soze?&quot; asks Verbal of Special Agent Kujan. &quot;You think a guy like that comes this close to getting caught, and sticks his head out? If he comes up for anything it'll be to get rid of me. After that... my guess is you'll never hear from him again.&quot; Of course, he also says things like &quot;Back when I was in barbershop quartet in Skokie Illinois&quot; and &quot;Back when I was picking beans in Guatemala, we used to make fresh coffee, right off the trees I mean.&quot; And a really good one (grimacing and teary-eyed): &quot;Why me? I am stupid, I am a cripple. Why me?&quot;<br />Nietzsche said: &quot;Talking much about oneself can also be a means to conceal oneself.\\"<br />Throwing someone off the sent, and doing this consciously or subconsciously, is nothing new. Things are not always how they appear or how they sound. Agent Kujan has preconceived notions about Keaton, about Verbal, and about himself. Because of these, he cannot see clearly. He also has his back turned to the bulletin board until the very end of the film.<br />Great script, great acting, great movie. <br />Michael
B00005Y7KX|4.0|With the huge success of such grand musicals as LES MISERABLES and THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA, it was perhaps obvious that sooner or later Victor Hugo's classic of love and fate, NOTRE DAME DE PARIS (AKA \\"The Hunchback of Notre Dame\\") would also get the musical treatment.  Disney had already done it before as an animated film, but this time, the tragic story would be presented as a big operatic musical production.  The end result would be somewhat mixed as NOTRE DAME DE PARIS became a theatrical box-office hit in both France and Canada, while underwhelming British and American audiences.  (Part of this could be blamed on an English translation that proved to be both repetitive and banal.)<br />This DVD of NOTRE DAME DE PARIS presents the production in its original French with the option to access other language sub-titles, including English.  There is also a 15 minute documentary covering the making of the musical.  NOTRE DAME DE PARIS is indeed a sprawling production on a grand scale.  It tells the story of the beautiful gypsy Esmeralda and of the three men who are enthralled by her: the soldier Phoebus, the priest Frollo, and Notre Dame's hunchbacked bell ringer, Quasimodo.  When Esmeralda is accused of a crime which she did not commit, Quasimodo rescues and shelters her in the sanctuary of Notre Dame.  However, things fall apart with tragic results.<br />Garou does a wonderful job of capturing the pain and humanity of Quasimodo.  With his plaintive gravelly voice, his is a touching performance.  Helen Segara makes for a wonderfully beautiful, if somewhat distracted, Esmeralda.  Daniel Lavoie is appropriately tortured as the nasty Frollo, while Patrick Fiori is solid as the shallow Phoebus.  Julie Zenatti makes the usually minor role of Pheobus' fiancée an effectively strong one, while Bruno Pelletier keeps things united as a poet/narrator.  The costumes, which basically suggest the story's medieval timeframe, are only partially successful in that some of the modern touches are far too jarring for the story.  The choreography also suffers since some of the numbers become far too sprawling and unfocused.  There are wonderful touches throughout, however, including the sobering heart-felt finale which is true to the novel.  (Something that most filmed versions of this classic tend to avoid.)<br />Despite its flaws, NOTRE DAME DE PARIS is definitely a show that respects its source material.  As a result, it deserves attention and is definitely worth a recommendation.
B00003CXCT|4.0|I live in Mexico. I have been a Star Wars fan since 1977. I'm 29 years old. On top of my TV I have a Jango Fett posable figure and a Gollum Figurine, next to a Homer Simpson. In one of my bookshelfs I have a bunch of different types of Storm Troopers (from the old era and from the new). <br />I've always thought that what was really cool about the Star Wars Trilogy were the secondary characters. I never really cared much about the stupid Jedis or Han or Leia or Luke and his father. When I was a kid I chose a storm trooper and created a whole story around it. My favorite characters are General Veers, Admiral Ackbar, the General guy from Empire Strikes Back and the chick that says: \\"Stand by, Ion Control... Fire!\\" and the Speeder Bike storm trooper that yells \\"Hey\\" to the Rebel Soldier. The rebel guys who get excited when someone tells them \\"the first transport is away, the first transport is away\\".<BR>The ability of the Star Wars Universe to make you use your own imagination to further the depth of those characters is what I love about Star Wars. And I think that is a big deal about what is great about The Lord of the Rings too.<br />The Special Editions came out, went to see each one about 4 times. Sure, I hated the same changes most of the whiners around here have already mentioned, but that didn't make me mad or try to boycott anything. Admiral Piett was still there, and also the guy from Third Rock from the Sun in Return of The Jedi.<br />Special Edition on DVD? I just found out today, while looking at a poster outside a Blockbuster store. Came running to Amazon to see when it was coming out. At the price they are selling it, I'll buy it, probably would have payed three times as much. <BR>And all of the whiners: admit it, you'll buy it too! (probably in Wal-Mart while nobody is watching).<br />And remember, it's not about \\"May the force be with you\\", it's about: \\"Imperial troops have entered the base!... Imperial troops have entered.....(Cut off)
B00000AFGM|1.0|it's amazing that after &quot;antichrist..&quot;manson would put forth somthing rediculous like this!it's like his influences went from alice cooper to devo or the aquabats!I thought this was a huge joke at first,but when you read the lyrics you can tell that he's actually serious-how retarded.he must've dropped the acid with the fruit of the loom logo on it to conjure up something of this nature.it really is as bad as a buttered tater is silly!
B000060P79|1.0|I usually have an opened mind toward music, but I think a band should have a certain amount of talent to be signed to a label and make albums and be famous. But Simple Plan is doing nothing new. They are making \\"pop punk,\\" which seems to be the current rage in music. I'm usually don't like punk music, but I do enjoy bands like The Clash, Pennywise, NOFX, The Ramones, The Descendents. Simple Plan is making punk music, only the singer sounds like a 12 year old boy whose voice hasn't cracked yet. Not to mention the rest of the band - i honestly thought the bassist was a girl the first time i saw him. The guitar parts are usually simple, as are the bass and drum parts. <br />Also, the lyrics suck. Thats the best way to put it. \\"I'm just a kid and nobody cares...\\"<br />You're 25 years old. Get a f*cking job and quit whining.<br />But hey, if this is your kind of music, have fun with it. I hate it when people persecute others for their choice of music.
B00005B1EX|5.0|Though I doubt that more than the drums are actually recorded live, and I'm sure the guitars and vocals were filled in from a studio recording, this CD has awesome sound. Unleased in the east was mostly redone in a studio, and I beleive so was this CD. But regardless this CD is worth every penny spent on it. Halford can make milk curdle with his screams....
B00003CXCT|1.0|Lucas needs to check his overinflated ego at the door - his \\"special editions\\" were awful! Why rework it even further?! Why destroy a masterpiece by continuing to to add paint and more paint? Lucas needs to release the original versions of the films which were perfect. \\"Modernizing\\" the films by adding more digital effects makes the old effects look silly. Lucas is ruining these films - STOP IT! RELEASE THE ORIGINALS! YOU CAN\\"T HAVE MY MONEY UNTIL THEN - you fool!
B0001ZMWQO|4.0|Franz Ferdinand is a breath of fresh air, with retro beats combined with their own unique sound. The momentum starts with &quot;Jacqueline&quot; and doesn't stop until the last second of the last song. This is one CD I feel as though I can listen to over and over, and never tire of it. This won't be everyone's favorite, but I love it. It's a mix of all genres, with great dance-y beats! Yes, many of the songs are catchy (such as &quot;Matinee&quot;, &quot;Take Me Out&quot;, and &quot;Auf Achse&quot;, to name a few), minus the annoyance and over-processed sound that many other popular artists of today possess. If you're looking for a lively and unique CD, try Franz Ferdinand.
B0002BO0US|4.0|I've been wanting this album or about a year now, but i can't get the import. so i've been patienty looking and waiting for this album, and it finally came. It is finally available in the U.S for the first time in 15 years(according to the sticker). And i must say, it was well worth the wait. This album is amazing. I bought it only having heard Time of the Season, and even though there are no other songs on this album like it, i love every single song. in my opinion you can't go wrong with this cd. I love it. Also, i like this reissue better than the 30th anniversary edition because I, personally, don't need the mono and stereo mix of the album, just one is fine for me. and on this copy you only get the stereo, and then you get 10 bonus tracks. I'd rather more bous tracks than another a different mix of the album i already heard. But that's just me.
B000002UAX|5.0|i love the beatles!!!!!!!! this is my favourite CD EVER!

B00006JDS4|4.0|A pretty young novelist rents a secluded cabin in the woods in order to have a nice, quiet place in which to hunker down and start writing the great American novel.  But instead of peace and serenity, she ends up as the victim of brutal rape and torture at the hands of a band of semi-literate rednecks.  She somehow survives the ordeal, though, and after regaining her physical and emotional bearing, she finds the inner strength to return to the scene of the crime and confront her attackers....  Thusly winds the plot of 1978's infamous and controversial revenge flick I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE (originally titled DAY OF THE WOMAN).<br />In the uncut version of this soupçon-budget flick--which is the version offered on the DVD from Elite--the gang-rape and torture sequence consumes an inordinate amount of screen time.  Though this sequence has sometimes been compared to the sodomy scene in Boorman's DELIVERANCE (1972), it is more often criticized as being merely gratuitous and subliminally misogynistic.  Unlike Boorman, who only slyly and skillfully SUGGESTS the sodomy and torture in his famous film, the director of I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE, Meir Zarchi, is unflinchingly graphic in his depiction of rape.  He doesn't want to do anything that might candy-coat this bitter pill, because he wants the audience to see just how abhorring such personal violation actually is.<br />Lauded by loyal fans as a simple film that makes an important and abstruse point, I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE is admittedly neither complex nor deep.  Yes, the plotting is rudimentary and subtext is virtually nonexistent.  Yes, the film lacks a musical score.  And, yeah, a few of the characters are trite, shallow, and one-dimensional, and some of the dialogue is hokey.  To certain aesthete filmgoers, this raw simplicity may come across as banal, sophomoric cinema.  But aesthetics is only a secondary concern with this film.  The primary purpose is to declare a particular message or two and to declare them as in-your-face as possible.  The film DOES indeed have a couple of staunch points to make regarding the repugnance of rape and misogyny, an individual's rights regarding their body, and the justification for exacting eye-for-an-eye revenge.  And it proclaims these points in a graphically straightforward manner that, if nothing else, certainly grabs the audience's attention.<br />The Elite DVD version of I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE offers a surprisingly clear, clean anamorphic transfer of the film in its original aspect ratio of 1.85:1.  The sound, while not as impressive as the digital video, is available in Dolby Digital 5.1, DTS Surround Sound 5.1, or the original mono.  The disc's extras include a feature commentary by the director, as well as a hilarious commentary track by cult-film aficionado and critic Joe Bob Briggs, the stage persona of actor/writer John Bloom.  (Joe Bob's articulate, knowledgeable, and extremely humorous commentary is itself worth the disc's purchase price.)  Also included are the theatrical trailers--some of which promote the film under its original title--various interviews, and press-coverage items that include the merciless repudiation of the film by some famous critics.  For a film that has generated such negative publicity over the years, this is quite meritorious bonus material.<br />True, I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE is an exploitative splatter film with a plot that is often dismissed by critics as a tale of one city girl and handful of sadistic hayseeds traipsing through a series of grisly scenes.  It's definitely not for the squeamish, but anybody who views the film is certain to walk away with a firm pathos for rape victims and a strong disdain for rapists.  And since that is what the filmmakers were aiming for, I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE must be regarded as a highly successful film.ce as possible.

B000148KK2|1.0|After hearing so many great things about her, I finally decided to purchase my first Diana Krall CD. Perhaps this offering wasn't a good place to start because I was unimpressed. I thought the production and lyrics were solid....the problem for me was Ms Krall's singing. I found Krall's vocal delivery emotionless, dry and weak. I did find two songs pleasant, but that was not enough to justify more than one star. While I applaud Ms Krall for being instrumental in revitialing the vocal jazz scene, I am sorry that I'm not a fan of her music.
B000002J09|5.0|This is an amazing album. It is quite possibly the best rock album of all time, and if you want to get into Led Zeppelin, this is the album you should buy.<br />Black Dog - 5/5: This is one of Led Zeppelin's best songs. Very hard rocking song with a really cool riff.<br />Rock and Roll - 4/5: Well, as the name says, this song is pure rock and roll. You've probably already heard this from car commercials... but, it's a good song, although I don't really like the riff that much.<br />Battle of Evermore - 4.5/5: This song is much softer than the other two songs. It has a very mythical feel to it and it has a few Lord of the Rings references in it.<br />Stairway to Heaven - 5/5: Well, what can I say. This is the best rock song ever, period. It is the most requested radio song of the 20th century, and with good reason. This song is truly and epic. It starts off with just a quiet acoustic guitar and works up into an amazing guitar solo and awesome climax.<br />Misty Mountain Hop 4.5/5: This is quite a cool song. It could either be interpreted as a hippy on his first drug trip, or another Lord of the Rings reference (Misty Mountains).<br />Four Sticks 4/5/5: Another very cool rock song.<br />Going to California - 5/5: One of Led Zeppelin's, and arguably their best folk song.<br />WHen the Levee Breaks - 5/5: My second favourite song on the album. This song is very cool. It's hard to describe, but, you need to hear it. Trust me, it's cool.
0316168815|3.0|I loved this book in the beginning! It seemed promising and authentic. It was written from a unique perspective also. A girl who was murdered watches from heaven as her family, friends,  law officials, and murderer all deal with the tragedy and move on with their lives.<br /> The heaven that she was in I found to be a bit uninspired and surprisingly secular. A little too secular if you ask me. It was almost as if the author was trying desperately not to offend anyone who might read it. There is no mention of God anywhere in the book. Which makes the author's presumption of after-life slightly curious and almost naive.<br /> Then all of the sudden there is this entirely incompatible scene where susie \\"drops down to earth\\" and takes over another girl's body. HUH? This was highly inconsistant with the rest of the story. And THEN when she has taken over this girl's body, you would think that she would use that time to show people where to find her killer, or at least her remains so that she might help to prevent other young girls from being killed or to bring closure to her family. Instead she takes this opportunity to have sex?? HUH? Not to mention that when she died she was a young teenage girl who had just been brutaly raped.  AHHH! <br /> I wanted so much for the book to end with as much genuine fervency as the beginning had. But all in all the ending was quite peculiar and frustrating.  I am glad I read it however and I will look for future books by this author.

B0001WTVUW|5.0|The made-for-TV film THE DAY AFTER was enormously controversial when it was originally broadcast on ABC in November of 1983, primarily because it was promoted as being the first film to accurately and realistically depict a nuclear holocaust and its aftermath.  Political right-wingers didn't like it because they believed such a film would deter support of a strong U.S. military and a large nuclear arsenal.  Those on the left were concerned that it might promote the idea that a full-scale nuclear war could be survivable, thereby INCREASING support of the right-wing's push for a strong U.S. military and a large nuclear arsenal.  And both sides were worried that the film would be too graphic for the prime-time position in which it was slotted to air.  In fact, much of the controversy was vehement enough to worry the sponsors, so consequently not a single minute of commercial time was sold for the part of the film following the depiction of the nuclear war--the last half of the show was aired commercial free!<br />Socio-political controversy aside, THE DAY AFTER is a very powerful and compelling drama.  In the tradition of great SF and horror films, it takes a real-life potentiality--in this case, nuclear holocaust--and portrays it as graphically and as realistically as possible, thereby allowing viewers to vicariously experience the nightmare. For this film, said nightmare takes place in the small towns surrounding Kansas City, one of the ground-zero targets for the enemy's hydrogen bombs.  But the real horror of it all is not the bombing itself.  The real horror is being a survivor and having to suffer through the aftermath with things like radioactive fallout, nuclear winter, contaminated food and water, political anarchy, and the like.<br />Portraying survivors from various walks of life, the highly talented cast--which includes big names like Jason Robards, JoBeth Williams, Steve Guttenberg, and John Lithgow, to name a few--does a fantastic job running the gamut of human emotion as their characters come to grips with the traumatic and devastating situation. The excellent script for THE DAY AFTER was written by Edward Hume, a respected TV writer best known for his work on series greats like THE FUGITIVE, CANNON (which he also developed), and THE STREETS OF SAN FRANCISCO.  And the film was directed by the venerable Nicholas Meyer, who has directed other SF greats such as 1979's TIME AFTER TIME, 1982's STAR TREK II: THE WRATH OF KHAN, and 1991's STAR TREK VI: THE UNDISCOVERED COUNTRY, and who has written the screenplays for other greats like 1976's THE SEVEN-PER-CENT SOLUTION (having previously written the novel), 1986's STAR TREK IV: THE VOYAGE HOME, and 1987's highly acclaimed FATAL ATTRACTION.  With such great talent behind it, it's not hard to defend the claim that THE DAY AFTER is ONE of the best films, if not THE best film, made specifically for TV.<br />The DVD from MGM is a no-frills disc, meaning that it is without bonus material, but it does offer a nearly pristine digital transfer of THE DAY AFTER in its original aspect ratio of 1.33:1.  And the asking price is very reasonable (especially with amazon.com's discount), so lovers of great films and good drama have no excuse for not having this gem in their collections.human emotion as their characters come to grips with the traumatic and devastating situation.

B0001CCXZW|5.0|Gilmore Girls is a witty, fast-paced, thoughful television show richly sprinkled with pop culture jokes and tidbits, set in the small town of Stars Hollow. Funnier than most shows out there now and able to tackle many serious and important issues facing people of all ages, this show is quality and is perfect for family viewing. Unlike numerous popular shows that rely on &quot;dumb jokes&quot;, Gilmore Girls contains only intelligent jokes and witty remarks that don't degrade or devalue the intellect of its viewers. You should give this show a chance and you will be delighted!!!!
B000099T2L|2.0|Beyonce is very beautiful and talented, so it pains me to have to write a negative review of her CD. I wanted to give  an objective review, so I listened repeatedly and drew the same conclusion each time. I found the music uninspiring and just plain dull. The lyrics were typical fluff and lacking in creativity and substance. Her singing was just ok for me but a tad bit dull and annoying after repeated listens. While I did find three songs to my liking, I  rather generously give this CD 2 stars. I am really excited for Beyonce for doing her thing but was unimpressed with her first solo effort.
B0000CFW87|5.0|I first became addicted to Josh Groban's voice when he released his first album.  After this one they may have to put me in rehab! ;) Each and every song on this album is experatly crafted and (most importantly) sung with powerful emotion by a beautiful voice.  From the first track &quot;Oceano&quot; to the last track &quot;Never let Go,&quot; I was spellbound.  Each and every song is amazing.  Some of my personal favorites include: &quot;When you say you love me,&quot; (really how could you NOT love that song?), &quot;per te&quot; (i had no idea what the words meant but I was moved to tears neverless), &quot;broken vow&quot; (bitter sweet and moving), &quot;remember when it rained&quot; (probably my favorite-Josh wrote, sung and played the piano for this song...ah a man of many talents!) &quot;you raise me up&quot; (I cried over the super-bowl appearance), and of course the opening and closing songs with all other in between.  I love this CD and know that anyone who listens to it will too.<br />Btw- anyone who wants to know translations to josh's lyrics (from both albums) can easily search on a search engine such as google for josh groban lyric translations and tons of sites will pop up with what you want. (i do recomend that you listen to the song first, otherwise you'll be mentally translating the lyrics into english in your head without hearing the song.)

B00005JMJ4|5.0|Sofia Coppola brilliantly explores the stifling emotions of longing and ennui.  The Murray and Johansson characters share a kind of physical and emotional isolation from their homes and their spouses respectively.  They long for some sort of tether and find it in each other.  <br />Coppola establishes the disconnected state of the main characters quickly.  She uses darkness and spatial constraints as motifs for the isolation.  Nearly all of Murray and Johansson's critical interactions take place at night or in a hotel room.  We only escape the darkness when Johansson contemplates at temples and of course, at the devastatingly beautiful ending.  Some may criticize this ending, but to me it was heart-pounding and believable considering the connection the two had.  Coppola does provide moments of unbridled joy that, juxtaposed with her portrayal of ineffable longing, become all the more intense.<br />I could go on analyzing this for hours.  This will be a film for the ages, and we are fortunate that we can see it now.
B00005JMJ4|2.0|When I sat down to watch this movie, I'll admit I went in with sky-high expectations. How could I not? It had won a handful of Golden Globes, and Sofia Coppola was the favorite for the Oscar for original screenplay. However, when it was over it left me wondering just what everyone saw in it. Particularly Bill Murray's performance -- it seemed to me all he did was sit around with a sad look on his face while he recited some dialogue in a bland tone. Apparently these days it's enough to win awards.<br />The main fault of this movie is its lack of plot. Lack of plot doesn't necessarily mean a movie is done for -- if it can make up for it with interesting and engaging characters. &quot;Lost In Translation&quot; neither has a plot nor interesting characters. Simply put, it's a boring movie. I do admire it, though -- the shots of Tokyo are breathtaking, and Scarlett Johansson shows amazing potential as an actress. Since she's only 19, we have many great things to expect from her. Some of the best shots of the movie are simply of her sitting in her hotel room, curled up as if to guard herself from the world. However, she is simply not enough to save this movie from being one of the most boring I have ever seen. Watch it if you're wanting to simply sit and admire the filmmaking. However, if you want entertainment, lose this movie.
B00000AFWZ|5.0|This is possibly the greatest collection that Rhino has ever come up with.  I had the original three Nuggets releases that Rhino did in the late 80's/early 90's and they were among my favorites in my early cd buying years.  This set eclipses my discs, and adds so much that the extra money spent isn't difficult to think of as an investment.  I've found that my favorite songs were mostly from the original three discs;<br />Lies - The Knickerbockers<br />Public Execution - Mouse &amp; the Traps<br />Psychotic Reaction - The Count Five<br />Let's Talk About Girls - The Chocolate Watchband<br />Open My Eyes - The Nazz<br />Incense and Peppermints - Strawberry Alarm Clock<br />Can't Seem to Make You Mine - The Seeds<br />Live - The Merry-Go-Round<br />I've also found some new favorites through listening to this set;<br />Double Shot (Of My Baby's Love) - The Swingin' Medallions<br />It's Cold Outside - The Choir<br />Put the Clock Back on the Wall - The E-Types<br />What Am I Going Do - The Dovers<br />7 and 7 Is - Love<br />Don't get me wrong, these aren't the only great songs in this collection, just my favorites off the top of my head after a quick look through the list.  This is a fascinating collection that gives a look at the songs that were regiional hits around the country, but occasionally also made little noise on a national scale.  For a box set it's among the best money I ever spent.

B00006RU5B|4.0|On paper, the combination of Chris Cornell and the Zach-de-la-Rocha-less members of Rage Against the Machine sounds like a disaster waiting to happen. But sonically, they rock like no other modern rock act of the new millennium. <br />The album opens with their first single &quot;Cochise&quot;. A big, bombastic record with an excellent primal scream, it sets the tempo for the rest of the album: these guys are ready to rock you HARD! The album continues to hit you in the gut with the excellent rock of &quot;Show Me How to Live,&quot; &quot;Gasoline,&quot; and &quot;What You Are&quot; before slowing it down for the hauntingly beautiful (and annoyingly ubiqutious) &quot;Like a Stone&quot;. From there, the album continues to bring the rock with an occasional slower song thrown in to let you catch your breath, but because the album is so hit-heavy in the front, the songs can get a little old. By the time you get to the end of the album you feel exhausted. That said, \\"Hypnotize\\" (track 10) is the best true rock on the album, and \\"I Am the Highway\\" (track 8) might be the best song on the album, period (its obvious \\"release me as a single!\\" status notwithstanding). All in all, this album is definitely worth picking up, but it might be better to hit the \\"random\\" button on your CD player instead of listening to it all the way through. <br />Worth noting: whether intentional or not, Audioslave have created something of a concept album about the open road: Many of the titles allude to driving, and the video for \\"Show Me How to Live\\" featured a lot of open road shots. Plus it's a great album to listen to while driving. That might not mean anything to you, but if you drive a lot and you need an album to crank while driving on the highway, this is the one you'll want to get.
B000003TA4|5.0|It's more like a 3.5-star CD (and I'm a huge, huge Nirvana fan, for the record). However, I feel like I have to do a little something to counteract all of the pointless 1-star reviews of the album. I have a piece of serious advice for those of you who bought this album because of the hype and found that it just didn't meet expectations -- go buy &quot;Bleach,&quot; &quot;In Utero,&quot; or even &quot;Unplugged.&quot; All three of those albums are much better than &quot;Nevermind,&quot; and maybe you'll find that you like them better. Don't dismiss Nirvana just because their most mediocre release happens to be the one that everyone picked up on and tells you you should buy. As for those of you who have never even listened to the album and just have fun tearing down Nirvana because you believe other bands are better -- well, you're stupid and you need to get lives, or at least start listening to CDs before you review them. Particularly you, AFI K or whatever.<br />Now, on the actual CD -- it's consistent mediocrity, which can be good or bad. It's consistent in that there are truly no bad songs on the album, and there aren't many albums that can hold that claim. But it is mediocre. There are a few standout tracks, such as of course &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit,&quot; &quot;Lithium,&quot; and &quot;Come As You Are.&quot; Personally, I find &quot;Polly&quot; to be one of the album's best moments -- the music is nothing complicated, but there's something to be said for simplicity in the music that doesn't detract from the poignancy of the lyrics. Most of the tracks are based on a poppy hook, which turns some people off (to those people I say I'm sorry you can't appreciate catchy, enjoyable music). But the fact is, the guitar parts here are not difficult, and while Kurt Cobain is a great lyricist, the lyrics here are not as good as on &quot;In Utero.&quot; <br />To tell you the truth, I think the reason this album is different from the others is that it is not completelyKurt Cobain's show. This album marked the arrival of one of the true great musicians of our time -- Dave Grohl. His amazing drumming is the proponent of this album. Without him, the album simply would not have been very good.<br />In conclusion, &quot;Nevermind&quot; is a pleasant listen, and it deserves credit for reviving good music, but it is not the band's best work by far. People need to stop going to the extreme with it -- it's not the best album of all time, and it's not the biggest piece of garbage of all time. Come on -- for it to be the worst album of all time, it would have to be worse than anything by Britney Spears. If you think a Nirvana album is worse than a Britney Spears album, you don't deserve to be reviewing music.
B00005JMCW|5.0|I loved this movie, the actors, the story, the directing, everything was so well put together! I love the soundtrack, it has all the best up-coming bands and singers!

It all starts with a fight about Anna's band having an audition that same night has the rehersal dinner, then the fortune cookie curse, and the strange earthquake that only Anna and Tess felt, and wake up the next morning in the other's body, everything changes, and they start to understand each other!<br />I recremend this movie to mothers and daughter's that want to get to now each other better and spend some time together! I also recremend the soundtrack to this movie becuase it has great songs to dance to, sing to, or to just sit and listen to!
0064407667|5.0|Dear Amazon.com Readers,<br />While exploring the children's section of my local Barnes And Noble, searching for a Christmas present for a five-year-old friend of mine, I stumbled upon The Bad Beginning: Rare Edition (essentially the same book with added notes from the esteemed Mr. Snicket in the back). I quickly picked up the book, made my purchases, and headed home, nearly getting run over by an SUV driven by a woman talking on a cell phone AND putting on makeup at the same time.<BR>When I got home, it occured to me that Nicholas' mother was rather protective and it might be a good idea for me to read the book first.<br />I was enthralled, a word which here means \\"distracted from everything else until the book was finished\\". =) All joking aside, I would not advise you to give this book to your children unless you know they are intelligent enough to distinguish fantasy from reality. The book features many lessons that it would behoove many young children to learn, such as how to deal with deaths in the family, abuse, as well as a large variety of other topics. I have read many reviews from overprotective parents as well as whiny pre-teen children who bemoan that this series is such a far cry from their sugar-coated \\"Fuzzy Bunny Learns To Share\\"-style books. Yes, this series is not for small children, nor is it for any adult who cannot enjoy a tragic comedy. But I highly reccomend this book to anyone intelligent enough to appreciate it. I am 16, and I cannot wait until I have my own children so that I can sit down and read them these stories...
B00006CXXU|5.0|This is a prime example of what music truly is. Christina is a star with a voice that even angels envy. All the songs on this album and perfectly written, sang, and...well i dunno there just good. When her first single off this album dropped i was in no way a christina fan but with her sexy lyrics and a video that kept you wantin more the cd quickly became part of my collection. there no way you can pick a favorite on this cd, its too perfect and the songs are all so different. you cant go wrong with this cd. i dont see why all of a sudden christina had been givin lables like \\"sl*t\\" or \\"wh*re\\". i mean you cant say she \\"changed\\" when in her first single she says the line \\"gotta rub me the right way\\" and in her video shes wearing belly shirt. Shes a great performer and vocalist and i advise everyone to run out and grab this cd belive me... you wont be dissapoitned. hopfully chirstina will have a 3rd cd for us soon. If you really dont want this cd and want to gett somthin different...go for Beyonce's Dangerously In Love, ya cant go wrong there..check out my review if your iffy
B0000C9V3T|5.0|I love this Cd! is my favorite!, it combines since classic music and western to soul, it's fantastic!, i like &quot;Don't let me be misunderstood&quot;, &quot;Green Hornet&quot; and &quot;Battle without honor or humanity&quot;. I don't care that it hasn't  ALL the songs of the movie, but it got the bests. For the person that write in his review that &quot;Seven notes in Black&quot;, is not in the CD, better check out the titles behind your disk and you can see that &quot;Seven Notes in Black&quot; is the same song that &quot;Ode to Oren Ishi&quot;. Bye bye.
B0000A98ZP|5.0|Some question the durability of &quot;The Breakfast Club,&quot; saying that the themes and plotlines do not hold up in today's teen society. As a 15-year-old, I would like to say that that is thoroughly untrue. 19 years after its release, &quot;The Breakfast Club&quot; is still a truthful, relateable account of teenagers and their personalities, and the ways in which they interact with each other. Sure, the stereotypes of the characters may be a bit exaggerated -- but that's necessary in order to get the point across. Watching this movie, I feel as if I know these people, or at least I've run across them at one point in my high school career.<br />The plot, as most people know, involves five different kids being assigned Saturday detention together. Each kid represents a typical high school stereotype -- a princess (Molly Ringwald), a jock (Emilio Estevez), a brain (Anthony Michael Hall), a basket case (the excellent Ally Sheedy), and a criminal (Judd Nelson). At the beginning of the day, none of them know each other, except for the princess and the jock. Throughout the day, they learn more about each other and work at tearing down the stereotypes that pit them against each other. As for the reviewer who said this isn't realistic that they would open up so much to each other -- it absolutely is. Put five kids into a room without an adult for nine hours, and they will talk about anything.<br />The beauty of this movie is the depth of the characters beyond the stereotypes -- particularly the nerd, Brian, who as we find out in the movie has problems well beyond what people think of him. He is the one that I most relate to in the movie. Watch &quot;The Breakfast Club,&quot; and see who you most relate to. It's a great experience. Beyond the social commentary aspect, it's also just a funny movie. The jokes come at breakneck speed, especially for the first half of the movie (before it gets somewhat serious). The actors are also very enjoyable in their roles, particularlyAlly Sheedy and Anthony Michael Hall. Highly recommended.
B0001XAPZ6|3.0|The DVD release of \\"Nausicaa of the Valley of Wind\\" will replace the 21 minutes of footage that were cut out in the VHS version that was released in the U.S. and U.K. (which was titled \\"Warriors of the Wind\\"). So please be careful when reading the above reviews, as they refer to the VHS version, not the DVD.<BR>As for the release date, the DVD was supposed to be brought out on August 31, 2004 (along with two other Miyazaki movies: \\"My Neighbor Totoro\\", which will feature a new voice cast, and \\"Porco Rosso\\"). No word yet on when this batch of DVD's will actually be released; hopefully sometime in the next few months!<BR>On a final note, I have not seen this movie, so please disregard the rating (I gave it 3 stars to be neutral). However, I have read the comic series (or \\"manga\\" as it is properly called) and I highly recommend it (there are four volumes all together). In fact, all of Miyazaki's work has been fabulous; check out \\"Princess Mononoke\\", \\"Spirited Away\\", \\"Castle in the Sky\\", \\"The Castle of Cagliostro\\", and \\"Kiki's Delivery Service\\", all wonderful films.
B00005JLR8|5.0|I don't often review movies but feel compelled to do so after watching IN AMERICA three times in the past couple days. I insisted on replaying it for my young daughters, who are about the same age as the beautiful girls in the film, so they could appreciate the story of a family who live on little more than love and faith in each other.<br />This story is triumphant. I dare you not to cry. Highly recommend.<br />From the author of I'm Living Your Dream Life and The Things I Wish I'd Said, McKenna Publishing Group
B0001KL5DA|5.0|This is a great show.  Well written, well acted and funny in that dark and subtle kind of way.  I wish all the episodes had commentary, but 5 of 13 will have to do.<br />Also, in response to a review posted earlier, the reason the West Wing is in widescreen format is because starting with the second season, the show itself was filmed in widescreen.  I assume that Siz Feet Under is filmed in regular Full Frame.  Even though I agree that widescreen is superior, you just can't change full frame to widescreen.
B00007BK2N|5.0|Great movie, lots-o-british humor, lots-o-british music history.  Too much Happy Mondays, not enough about New Order but you get to see the birth of the rave scene which is very cool.  Where else can you get a movie and see a guy hang himself while watching a chicken dance on his TV....
0790729725|3.0|I truly cannot fathom the thought of this film being better than &quot;The Godfather&quot; or &quot;The Godfather Part 2&quot; I was flabbergasted when I read some of these reviews. OMG, &quot;Goodfellas&quot; is at best a well-crafted IMITATION of the number one movie of all time. And Scorsese's best picture? No freakin' way, haven't any of you people seen &quot;Raging Bull?&quot;  That is his masterpiece!  I admit &quot;Goodfellas&quot; is an enjoyable movie, but the only thing memorable about it is Joe Pesci's loud mouth.  By the way, I think it's very sad that Scorsese cloned this movie, set it in Vegas, and called it &quot;Casino.&quot;  What a pile of crap that one was!  &quot;RAGING BULL&quot; IS A MASTERPIECE, YOU MUST OWN IT!  Just rent this one, it's good, but no way would I buy it.  By the way, to all you &quot;THUG LIFE GANGSTA wanna-be's, if you think this movie is &quot;HARD,&quot; check out &quot;American Me&quot; with Edward James Olmos, that movie makes &quot;Goodfellas&quot; look like &quot;Barney.&quot;
0060730552|5.0|Once I started this book I could not put it down.  The story is fascinating, and the writing is very intelligent and intense. The details of the climb and descent are gripping.  After what he went through, it's amazing he still chooses to go climbing. Highly recommended!
B000002UA0|5.0|1967's \\"The Piper At The Gates Of Dawn\\" is the one that started it all for Pink Floyd, back in the early days when bassist Roger Waters, keyboardist Richard Wright & drummer Nick Mason were led by the genius, but doomed singer/guitarist Syd Barrett. Psychedelic rock doesn't get much more trippier than \\"Piper,\\" a totally far-out collection of avant-garde space rock, songs about gnomes and scarecrows, off-the-wall production and sound effects, and superb performances by a tight British art-rock band that were destined to become rock legends. Although he made one last \\"cameo\\" appearance with the Floyd on their second album, \\"A Saucerful Of Secrets\\" with that album's closing number, \\"Jugband Blues,\\" the lion's share of Syd Barrett's legacy with the band is all contained right here on \\"Piper,\\" barring a few early singles. Writing all but one song, and, with a charismatic singing voice and incredible guitar-playing skills, Barrett was truly a musical genius, and his equally-talented bandmates match him song for song. Every track on the album is a highlight in it's own right, but certainly worth mentioning are such tracks as the opening space rock of \\"Astronomy Domine,\\" the before-there-was-alternative alternative rock of \\"Lucifer Sam,\\" the far-out instrumentals \\"Pow R Toc H\\" and \\"Interstellar Overdrive,\\" the frenetic rock of \\"Take Up Thy Stethoscope And Walk\\" (written & sung by Waters, in his debut composition for the band), the charming tale of \\"The Gnome,\\" and the classic, half children's song/half freak-out finale, \\"Bike,\\" which starts out cheerily enough before giving way to some deliciously wacko noises and sound effects.Sadly, and tragically, shortly after the release of \\"Piper,\\" Syd Barrett's experimentations with psychedelic drugs ultimately destroyed him, and he was finally ousted from the band. Roger Waters more-or-less took over as the group's leader, and Barrett's vacated slot was filled by guitarist David Gilmour. Barrett, despite his drug-addicted state, would record a pair of solo albums before dropping out of the music business altogether. Not well enough to look after himself, he quietly lived in the care of family members until his death in 2006. Pink Floyd, meanwhile, would go on to major superstardom and sell millions of albums, with such classics as \\"Dark Side Of The Moon,\\" \\"Wish You Were Here,\\" \\"Animals\\" and \\"The Wall.\\" But \\"The Piper At The Gates Of Dawn\\" was the band's very first chapter, and one that would not have been possible without the great Syd Barrett. \\"Piper\\" is outstanding psychedelic rock, and a Pink Floyd classic. And thank you, Syd, wherever you are.
B00028HBKM|2.0|I start this review with a confession, as is the Catholic custom: I am Jewish.  Now, with this out of the way, I hope this doesn't somehow invalidate my opinion on the matter.  I saw this film opening day and entered hoping for perhaps to see the appeal of all the religions of Jesus.  This movie, however, repelled me from Jesus, and it failed to attract me.  Nowhere in the movie do I learn the teachings of Jesus.  Towards the end, we see clips of his last supper where he preaches forgiveness.  Yet, when he is on the cross with the thieves, God sics a raven to attack the non-believer.  That is the exact opposite of forgiveness: it's punishment.  Beyond that, the film is an expose of gore.  For over an hour, I got to see a man splattered around the screen.  Regardless of whether it happened and whether or not he is my savior, seeing his pain does not bring me closer to him.  I sympathize, not convert!  It presents a spiritual experience based on blood and violence, which I find horrendous.  It explains to me all the evil deeds that have been done in his name, such as the crusades, church bombings, and pogroms.  Please, I beg you Christians: rejecting this feast of gore as your faith would bring me closer and dispell me of this loathing I feel for your violent attitudes towards the world.  Start living the teachings of your savior and reject this film!
0792163710|2.0|Don't get me wrong, folks ,I am A HUGE fan of classic Westerns!  This one, it just doesn't make it for me.  Don't even get me started about Alan Ladd's &quot;tough but gentle&quot; potrayal of Shane.  Ladd is unconvincing to this reviewer not only in the tough guy category, but his dramatic side is very, very &quot;Ward Cleaver.&quot; AND THAT KID!!!  That blasted kid. Joey, played by Brandon De Wilde. Good gawd, if he wasn't the most annoying little snot that came out of Hollywood. (before the debut of Pauly Shore)  &quot;Shane, are you gonna shoot that man?  &quot;Shane, are you gonna let me look through your Playboys?&quot;  I spent half the film (before I fell asleep) hoping Shane would say, &quot;Come here, Joey, and help me change the wheel on this stagecoach&quot; and have a little &quot;accident.&quot;  Joey's absence from the second half of this movie MAY have kept me awake.  (but I doubt it.)
B00005JL3A|5.0|First off, I have never played the game so I was able to watch the movie unbiased.  Which I guess worked to my favor since I absolutely love this movie.  I know people who played the game don't really care for it because it doesn't follow but I loved it.<br />I loved it because it is a good concept movie, which you don't get a whole lot these days.  My favorite person was Caplan.  I wish he made it to the end but you can't have everything right?  <br />Anyway, the movie starts out in the Hive.  You get a look at someone throwing a vile in the lab and running.  You see three different settings going on.  The Red Queen notices the broken vile and takes action.  People are killed by drowning, falling in the elevator or by the halox (is the spelled right?).  Then cut to Alice, who is in the shower and apparently has fainted.  <br />The movie is perfect, simply because a movie can't be perfect.  Your going to get some people saying the hated it and some people saying it was ok and some people loving it.  I think it is definately worth seeing for yourself and making up your own mind.<br />The last scene of the movie (I won't go into detail), I think is the best scene.  In one scene, Milla portrays just about every emotion there is in this one scene.  Scared, confused, disoriented, terrified, amazement, wonderment, lonliness, hurt, betrayal, strength and courage.  <br />See the movie, if only one time and draw your own opinions.  Go in with an open mind and come out with your conclusion.
B0001VWP8I|5.0|America is a great place for music an d all, but so is the rest of the world.<br />While most of America is in the Hip-Hop and Dance stuf (which isnt a bad thing AT ALL), i really do feel that we do miss some great artists: thus the case with Anastacia<br />Anastacia has been around for quite some time now, but she is popular overseas and not in her native US of A. \\"America\\" really doesnt know what they are missing.<br />ANASTACIA is her 3rd album, and third luck DOES have its charm!<br />Anastaica shows some more \\"grown-up\\" sound and all in this one. Not That Kind and Freak of Nature are not bad albums AT all, but ANASTACIA (her new self titled album) is extremely different than ANYTHING she has put out in the past years.<br />Standout songs in my opinion include:<br />Seasons Change<BR>Left Outside Alone<BR>Time (ONE OF MY FAVORITE SONGS SO FAR TO COME ALONG)<BR>Sexy Single<br />But all in all, this is one ROCKING album and all.<br />If you havent heard of Anastacia before, go GET THIS ONE!! It is something different and DEFINITELY a breath of fresh air.<br />Isnt it time for a change anyhow? Chage is ALWAYS good!
B00020HEL6|5.0|I just love it when I discover a new and dazzling talent, and Renee Olstead certainly falls under that category!  I saw a rave review about Renee in Liz Smith's gossip column and ordered this cd on her recommendation.  From the first moment of the cd to the last, I could not believe my ears.  This young woman is so talented, it has to be a gift from God!  I love her voice, I love her phrasing -- she just &quot;has it&quot;!  I have read other reviews discussing Renee's age and the sophistication of the songs she sings.  I have listened to this cd over and over, and my conclusion is that she truly understands of what she sings!  My favorites are &quot;Summertime&quot; and &quot;Is You Is or Is You Ain't My Baby,&quot; because they show the full range of Renee's incredible voice.  However, there is not a song here I don't love.  To think that she is 14 years old -- her potential is off the charts!  I just gave copies of this cd to two friends today, and the clerk at Borders told me Renee was selling fast -- I got the last two copies in the store.  God bless you, Renee!  Keep centered and get the best career advice available.  I know we will be seeing much more of you in the years to come.
B00004RF97|5.0|This is my absolute favorite performance by the great Katherine Hepburn.  She is breathtaking and absolutely wonderful.  Brilliant performances all across the board, an especially funny performance by James Stewart is just the icing on the cake.  Cary Grant,one of my faves, also delivers a magnificent performance. Also worth mentioning is the very beautiful Ruth Hussey, whose potrayal of Liz is stunning.  She was one of the most attractive actresses at the time, in my humble opinion. This movie is very funny and the sets and costumes are among the best Hollywood has ever offered.  I highly recommend this as a must own.
B000000Y2R|3.0|Other than excerpts available here on Amazon, I haven't actually heard either this CD or the 20-bit remastered version of it.  Based solely on the description, however, I instead ordered The Jazz Factory's 2003 CD &quot;Complete Jazz at Massey Hall&quot;  (JFCD 22856) (referred to hereafter in this review as &quot;CJMH&quot;), and I am very glad I did.  Here's why:<br />1.  In addition to the 6 quintet tracks on the present CD, CJMH includes 8 other tracks from the concert, including a 4-and-a-half-minute self-contained drum solo by Max Roach, and 6 great tracks by a trio of Powell, Mingus, and Roach (Cherokee, Embraceable You, Halleluja, Sure Thing, Lullaby of Birdland, and I've Got You Under My Skin).  Also, according to the liner notes, all 14 tracks are in the order in which they were performed at the concert.<br />2.  NONE OF MINGUS' OVERDUBBED BASS is included on CJMH.  You can still hear him, though, but much more naturally than he sounds on the overdubbed excerpts I've heard here on Amazon.<br />3.  According to the notes on the CJMH case, the &quot;original analogue masters have been digitally transferred at 24 bit resolution, processed using Sonic Solutions NoNoise technology and mastered to 16 bit for CD using prism SNS Noise Shaping.&quot;  Whatever that means, the sound for the most part is great.  Some of the tracks start a bit abruptly, and the sound on the 6 trio tracks is variable, but the sound quality of the 6 quintet tracks is phenomenal.  Again, there is no Mingus overdubbing present, and--especially when Bird and Diz are playing--the sound has great clarity and presence.  There is no real audible tape hiss except when only the rhythm section is playing and the levels are raised a bit.  In general, the sound is far from perfect, but is pretty amazing given the time and circumstances of the original recording.<br />4.  CJMH is very nicely packaged and presented, including a 12-page pamphlet with extensive notes about and photos of the concert.<br />To sum up, not knowing what to expect from this import when I ordered it, I was very pleasantly surprised by the extremely high quality of both the sound and the packaging of CJMH.  I would highly recommend it, instead of or in addition to the present CD, for anyone who wants a more complete and accurate recording of the Massey Hall concert./>To sum up, not knowing what to expect from this import when I ordered it, I was very pleasantly surprised by the extremely high quality of both the sound and the packaging of CJMH.

B0000DD7LC|5.0|After close to 6 months of hesitation, i FINALLY bought this album.... and i am SO HAPPY that i did.<br />I remember being in Biloxi, Mississippi and in the navy for barely 3 - 4 months, and i remember hearing about this ALICIA KEYS person. WHen she first came out with \\"Fallin'\\" it was one of thos esongs i secrectly loved. Buying her debut was DEFINITELY on there, and still have to this day<br />Alicia DEFINITELY avoids the Sophmore curse that seems to follow COUNTLESS OTHERS. She SUPRASSES her debut by so much on this one.<br />The music is great and the songs full of feeling.<br />I really do not know how to describe this album because i can go on forever and ever on how good it is.<br />Check out the review from music-critic.com: <br />[...]<br />GO GET THIS ONE!!! ITS ONE OF THE VERY BEST OUT THERE!!!
B000148KK2|1.0|I am a loyal Diana Krall fan.  I have every cd she has produced, and I play her music often.  To this point, I have loved the music Diana has played.  I enjoy her husky voice, and she is a first rate pianist.  I love her Paris album and literally everything she has done to this point.  This new cd, however, is beyond my comprehension.  Maybe, as others have said, I am not a true jazz afficionado; however, I just don't get these songs.  One or two seemed to have melodies, while the rest played like dirges.  I was playing this cd while driving around town, and at some points I said out loud, &quot;You've got to be kidding.&quot;  Sorry, if you are a Diana Krall fan, and I know they are legion, this cd is very different from what you are used to hearing from her.  I remember something similar when Harry Connick decided to do something totally different from his old standards for which he had become famous.  He, too, lost me. I'll wait for the next one and hope for the best.
B0000AMRJC|4.0|Five stars for Pacino's performance, three stars for the plot, it's just not very realistic.  Pacino's Tony Montana carries this movie and makes it watchable over and over again.
B0001UL7RY|1.0|After an amazing first album, I couldn't wait to buy her second album.  I was thoroughly disappointed.  It is horrible.  In my opinion, it has 3 good songs, top.  However, that is based on her material from her first album.  Perhaps, for a first time listener, this would be a good album.  My recommendation...don't buy this album.
B000024D4R|5.0|If ever there was a worse crime in the history of rock and roll than the general public ignoring Animals, I don't know what it is. (Maybe the studio disc on Ummagumma). I must admit, the first time I listened to this album, I was immeasurably disappointed. I had just purchased three Floyd CDs: Meddle, Division Bell, and Animals. Much to the opposite of my expectations, I loved Meddle, detested the overbearing tripe of Division Bell, and wasn't pleased at all with Animals, which I thought would be my favourite. I mean, it's right between Wish You Were Here and The Wall! <BR>Maybe I should have remembered that I hated The Wall at first, too. Because the more I listened to this album, the more I liked it. Some of Floyd's works took me and grabbed me and FORCED me to listen with a dumb grin - specifically, WYWH and The Dark Side of the Moon. And some took a little getting used to, like The Wall. And that's what Animals did. Because, in reality, it's one of the band's very best albums.<br />Animals is a solid rocker throughout, framed by two acoustic pieces that are irritating the first time, endearing the second time, and eventually become dear to your heart. &quot;Dogs&quot; is the hardest track to like, since it splices two musical styles and lasts a full seventeen minutes, but once you catch on to it it stays with you. &quot;Pigs (Three Different Ones)&quot; is one of the band's very best rockers - and manages to make lines like &quot;Big man, pig man, ha ha, charade you are&quot;, which look absolutely terrible on paper, come alive. &quot;Sheep&quot; starts out slow, then Roger and David commence their crashing. Roger screams out long passages of lyric in one breath, and David answers him with a guitar slam of epic proportion. The guitar at the end of this track is absolutely stunning. The lyrics in Animals make you really respect these guys. My personal favourite part of the album is the ending of Dogs, that describes the destruction of the title animal. But perhaps the best line in the album is this, which may look ponderous when written out but which flows perfectly with Roger's singing - &quot;And it's too late to lose the weight you used to need to throw around&quot;.<BR>So, anyone who doesn't like this album and who is a genuine Floyd fan should listen to it again. I did, and I'm so very glad I did. Because this has become one of my most treasured CDs.<BR>(P.S. The inflatable pig is pretty cute, too ;))
6305327084|5.0|I saw this film once before but, unawares, rented it again and, even though I realized I had seen the movie previously after it started, I enjoyed even more the second time. This is quality movie-making: good production values, a good script, good acting. I even ordered a Neil Diamond album after watching the &quot;impromtu&quot; singing of Sweet Caroline in a fun bar scene. Ensemble acting at its best, we have Rose O'Donnell, Uma Thurman and Matt Dillon featured along witn talented others. Timothy Hutton is perhaps the most interesting character in the film as a lost soul and his 30-something character's &quot;romance&quot; with thirteen-year-old Marty played by Natalie Portman is truly remarkable. I don't know what federal laws I was breaking but I was in love with Marty and I secretly hoped that Hutton's character returned to get her when she turned eighteen. What an amazing adult woman in a thirteen-year-old's body! They had a fascinating and strange relationship. Uma Thurman is good as the unavailable spirit who visits and then disappears. Her line about looking for a man who can say (and supposedly mean) just four words (&quot;Good night, sweet girl&quot;) was memorable. Rosie O'Donnell's rant about men and their attraction for the false and superficial beauty of media images of women was hilarious and almost show-stopping. Lots to like here.
0553573403|3.0|This book was good, but nowhere near great. When I see the Tolkien comparisons, it makes me shake my head. While I'm not a Tolkienite, there are certain things I give him credit for, and many of those center around knowing appropriate language. Martin is a great writer, but he falters in this genre. In some cases, on the first page in fact, he alters phrases but retains their original meaning. Except the changes he makes often remove the context that provides the meaning. It threw me out of his story too many times, and reminded me very much of a schmeerp (something changed just to make it fantastical, not because it makes sense). Other words or phrases are distinctly 20th-century, and also derive meaning from things that didn't exist prior to very modern times. Ok, if you're writing sci-fi or modern fiction but jarring in a setting so closely tied to medieval Europe. Others have discussed the similarities to this work and the War of the Roses, but the similar plot doesn't bother me so much as the similar names. It looks like a schmeerp again, esp. if you know the history or have read Shakespeare's historical plays.<br />Warning: Possible Spoilers<br />I read both horror and romances so neither the sex nor the violence bothered me. Gratuitous description did. The continuous description of the glistening rings in someone's  hair were just as bad the continuous description of other glistening body parts. Some of Martin's similes are also groan-worthy. When Drogo made love to Dany by picking her up \\"like a child\\" - yeesh.  Others have also mentioned the postmodernist idealogy in this book but I don't think the gray morality is quite so bad as some claim. In fact, I finished the book wondering if the current grayness wasn't meant to be part of the problem facing the Kingdoms: a disbelief in morality similar to the disbelief in the superstitions re: things beyond the Wall. On the plus side, Martin avoids the excessive exposition of other writers (ie Jordan) though sometimes this works against him when a sudden paragraph detailing a burial custom, etc, is inserted into the narrative. He also constructs interesting characters, but too many perspectives. A little trimming could've gone a long way to tightening the plot. Example: there's a chapter in Bran's pov that could've easily changed to Robb's.  And more problematic, not all of these pov's seem as relevant as others. This book has some great original ideas -- dire wolves & the Wall being some of the best -- but it also suffers from some generic plots/characters.(Most things Viserys and Drogo will be painfully familiar to readers of historical romances.)<br />But this isn't a history book: it's a fantasy epic. Not a fantasy perhaps as defined by Tolkien's \\"On Fairy Stories\\" nor an Epic as defined by Aristotle's Poetics but certainly both in our modern context. My last complaint involves Martin's balance. In one chapter, Jon is told explicitly that the Game of Thrones won't matter once Winter arrives, and this tends to undermine the plot of political intrigue dominating the rest of the book (tho the dragons may prove this assertion wrong). After 800+ pages, I don't think it's asking too much to know the focus of the book. Overall, still a worthwhile read in my opinion. Just don't believe the hype.mes this works against him when a sudden paragraph detailing a burial custom, etc, is inserted into the narrative. He also constructs interesting characters, but too many perspectives. A little trimming could've gone a long way to tightening the plot. Example: there's a chapter in Bran's pov that could've easily changed to Robb's.  And more problematic, not all of these pov's seem as relevant as others. This book has some great original ideas -- dire wolves & the Wall being some of the best -- but it also suffers from some generic plots/characters.(Most things Viserys and Drogo will be painfully familiar to readers of historical romances.)<br />But this isn't a history book: it's a fantasy epic. Not a fantasy perhaps as defined by Tolkien's \\"On Fairy Stories\\" nor an Epic as defined by Aristotle's Poetics but certainly both in our modern context. My last complaint involves Martin's balance. In one chapter, Jon is told explicitly that the Game of Thrones won't matter once Winter arrives, and this tends to undermine the plot of political intrigue dominating the rest of the book (tho the dragons may prove this assertion wrong). After 800+ pages, I don't think it's asking too much to know the focus of the book. Overall, still a worthwhile read in my opinion. Just don't believe the hype.
B00006LSM3|4.0|I WEPT upon hearing Marwa Blues for the first time, and I don't cry at the drop of a hat.  No song has ever struck me quite like this one.  I literally had to listen to it a couple more times to believe my ears.  I'm very fond of all the songs on this album - George's irreplaceable style as always, but in my opinion, Marwa Blues glowingly shines over all the others.  This is a lush, stunning and heartbreakingly beautiful instrumental that has to be heard to be believed.  It is one of the most wonderous things my ears have ever been blessed with.  To bittersweetly savor such delicate and deep musical beauty flowing from this man's soul in his last days on earth, along with the knowledge that there would be no more music from him was overwhelming to me and the tears just flowed.  Throughout our lives, we pick up and carry, in our heart, little pieces of all the things we love most.  Marwa Blues has a permanent place in my heart forever.  My life is a little richer just for having heard it........... Yes, it's THAT good. <br />I also feel the need to stand up and defend Jeff Lynne from the ridiculous flack he has caught from his part on this album. I was thrilled when I heard that Jeff was going to collaborate on this project.  He is a musical genius who creations I've always been a great fan of, and Jeff and George have always been a magical combination for me.  Jeff, as well as George, has his own distinct musical style, and Jeff was unfairly critized by some for simply being true to that style.  If people want a different sound, then they should listen to a different artist.
B000268QB2|4.0|I don't profess to be an expert on British pop, though I may become one someday and then I'll write a new review. Keane's influences go far earlier than Coldplay. Keane is their own band and if they become popular it will not be just because Coldplay has opened the American market.<br />Some album highlights:<br />1. Somewhere Only We Know - Anybody hear Beatles in there?<br />4. We Might As Well Be Strangers - The most Coldplay-esque of all the songs on the album. <br />5. Everybody's Changing - Music has developed so much since Band Aid and Cars and Tears for Fears. This song completely obliterates the past twenty years of progress.<br />6. Your Eyes Open - More 80s, but I actually like this song a lot. Probably my 2nd favorite. (favourite?) Keane would do well to develop their sound after the lead of this song. My only  complaint is that it ends too abruptly.<br />7. She Has No Time - Keane should keep writing songs like this. Chaplin's vocals are amazing.<br />10. Untitled 1 - This song shows some experimentation, and could be a hit based on uniqueness alone.<br />11. Bedshaped - My favorite on the album. Has a &quot;big&quot; sound that hints at Keane's potential. <br />SO... Can Keane survive the early 21st century without guitars? Can they be recognized apart from Coldplay and Radiohead? I think the answer is obvious.
0553382179|5.0|I have been on a continuing quest to get my apartment in order. We work long hours, have two young children and live in a tiny NYC apartment.

Best yet, it hooked me up to the website [...] which is even better than the book and free.
0783225482|4.0|A film by Robert Zemeckis<br />I think that it is fair to say that this is a strange movie.  Helen (Goldie Hawn) is engaged to be married to Dr Ernest Menville (Bruce Willis), a famous plastic surgeon.  They watch a rather awful show at the theatre and go backstage to meet the star, Madeline Ashton (Meryl Streep).  Madeline and Helen knew each other in high school, and Helen believes that Madeline intentionally steals every boyfriend Helen has.  This is the final test before the wedding.  Naturally, Madeline, who is vain about her appearance and worried about aging, does steel Ernest away and ends up marrying him herself.  This drives Helen crazy, literally.  We flash forward seven years to get an update on the characters, then another seven years to bring us to the main section of our story.  Madeline is aging and she hates it.  She meets up with Helen again, and Helen looks fantastic, as if she hasn't aged a day in the past 14 years.  Helen is all glammed up and looks like a star.  Madeline is starting to look frumpy.  It is all starting to come full circle and Madeline's jealousy is driving her to do something rash.<br />Rather than do something predictable (in the movies, anyway) like start killing people, Madeline goes to a strange woman named Lisle (Isabella Rossellini) and gets a potion that halts the aging process and returns the body to its youthful, more perfect image.  It also bestows immortality.  Now Madeline can compete with Helen again!  This rivalry and this fight will continue on through life and even into death.<br />\\"Death Becomes Her\\" is a comedy.  It is a very strange comedy, and has something of a dark humor, but it is without question an original movie.  It is one of the more overlooked movies in Robert Zemeckis's filmography.  He is better known for \\"Back to the Future\\", \\"Forrest Gump\\" and \\"Cast Away\\".  This isn't a perfect movie, but it is entertaining, creative, and interesting.  One important thing that I can say is that I did not find this movie predictable at all.  I had no idea where Zemeckis was going with \\"Death Becomes Her\\" until the end.<br />-Joe Sherrythis movie predictable at all.  I had no idea where Zemeckis was going with \\"Death Becomes Her\\" until the end.  <br />-Joe Sherry

B00006AG5N|5.0|Living and born in the South I was always a fan of Elvis. I couldn't name that many of his song, I had no CDs, and I watched one or two of my Mom's movies on him. The movies were entertaining, I enjoyed them, and I considered myself a fan of Elvis. When I was wandering around Walmart with a friend, we came upon a stand of CDs. After seeing Elvis 30 #1 Hits, I immediatly snatched it up. My Mom said she had some Elvis CDs I could listen to, but she had never pulled them out. That's why I had never had a CD of his. Thus, my first Elvis CD! <br />I was familiar with some of the first songs, &quot;Heartbreak Hotel&quot;, &quot;Hound Dog&quot;, and &quot;All Shook Up&quot;. Those are just to name a few. But on a trip the day after buying this CD, I sat and listened to it the whole way through. I was surprised on what I had missed out on. The CD's songs were impressive and overall great! I usually start to pick favorites on a CD I get, but I couldn't. I loved them all! <br />This is a amazing CD compiled with some of his greatest songs, or #1 hits. I only wish there could have been more songs on here like &quot;Blue Suede Shoes&quot; or &quot;I Was the One.&quot; Well, those are for another CD I suppose. I quickly bought Elvis 2nd To None after this one. I couldn't get enough of his songs! This CD is great for someone's first Elvis CD, but any of them are!
B00005JK8K|2.0|i admit, it made me cry - but what ever happened to the lady nurse who helped Joe Enders pass his hearing test in order to be able to go back to war, and was writing him all the time? the characters are static, though the Navajos are slightly more dynamic; there was little background info. too much bombs and shooting throughout, and i especially did not like the melodramatic part when Enders killed Whitehorse along with the Japs and then told Yahzee,&quot;I killed him. I threw a bomb and blew him up,&quot; acting so sarcastic, wanting to provoke and die. finally, the code language should have been featured more.
B0001Z363W|1.0|This is a redneck album, fueled by Zakk Wylde's racist beliefs. Anyone who gives this album more than one star is racist. btw, this is a miserable album.<br /><br />Highlight: Your trailer park neighbourhood wouldnt mind it even at high volume.
B00006CXXU|4.0|When I opened my brand-new spankin' CD I didnt know what to expect...... I was actually preying that it was nothing like her debut CD! But it was a complete surprise! Songs like &quot;Make Over&quot;, &quot;Soar&quot; and &quot;Underappreciated&quot; MAKE the CD! She's truly come along way from her teeny bopper days! <BR>This is a CD that I will never get tired oF!
B0001AP12G|4.0|1.)Intro 7/10 It has either Bernie Mac or Cedric The Entertainer at the start. <BR>2.)We Don't Care 9/10 He's talking about the kids that most people would think are going to be dead or messed up. Are doing good, because they didn't care what people say. <BR>3.)Graduation Day 8/10 On here them man kicks Kanye off the campus for not doing what he said. And then some one starts singing. <BR>4.)All Falls Down (featuring Syleena Johnson) 10/10 He tells about a girl in this song, and her troubles. <BR>5.)I'll Fly Away 9/10 A soulful skit with about three or four men singing. <BR>6.)Spaceship (featuring GLC and Consequence) 9/10 This is a good song although the beat did help it out. I still like their verses. <BR>7.)Jesus Walks 10/10 everybody who beleives in Jesus, really everybody in him or not. Should not have a problem with this song. More rappers should make songs like this.  <BR>8.)Never Let Me Down (featuring Jay-Z and J.Ivy) 10/10 both Jay-Z and Kanye had cold verses. And J.Ivy had strong words in the song. <BR>9.)Get em high (featuring Talib Kweli and Common) 9/10 Good song didn't think he would make one like this though. They all had good rhymes in this song. Especially Kanye and Common. <BR>10.)Workout Plan 7/10 It has these girls with Kanye's work out plan. And then her friends buy it from her for 3.99. <BR>11.)The New Workout Plan 9/10 This tells women how to get a rapper or a NBA player. Or at least a guy with a car.  <BR>12.)Slow Jamz (featuring Twista and Jamie Foxx) 9/10  Good song and beat. I just didn't know Jamie Foxx knew how to sing. This song is more for the ladies. <BR>13.)Breath in Breath Out (featuring Laducris) 8/10 Luda had the chrous and Kanye did the rest. It kind of has a catchy chrous. <BR>14.)School Spirit 6/10 It is this man telling you about how good it is when you get all these diplomas. <BR>15.)School Spirit 2 7/10 Chrous is alright, this is the only I'm not really into. <BR>16.)Lil Jimmy Skit 7/10 He tells you to get you all these degrees <BR>17.)Two Words (featuring Mos Def, Freeway, and The Harlem Boys Choir) ?/? this is where I get mixed up. but anyway Jimmy dad dies. <BR>18.)Last Call 9/10 I think they got two words and last words mixed up. at least on my album. but a cold song. <BR>19.)Through The Wire 10/10 Kanye West raps through this song with his mouth messed up. And that's a real MC and the song was still cold. <BR>20.)Family Business 10/10 a touching song with a creative chrous. <BR>Hidden Track <BR>21.) Kanye West raps at the start and then he tells how he got sign to Roc a Fella. 8/10 <br />This is a very good album he just had too many skits and that squeaky voice on the chrouses. But over all it was a very nice album. Kanye West rhymes in a way alot of rappers havn't for a while. This is a good album it is kind of soulful and real. Don't be shocked to see alot more from this man.
B0000AGWJ7|5.0|These guys are one of the best kept secrets anywhere.  The only reason I am going to the warped tour this year is because of them.  Thank god for madden last year or a lot of other people would have never noticed these guys from cali.  I'm not even a fan of metal, but this album has converted me over a little bit.  I can play this in my car anytime and never get sick of it.  I love how they are heavy and mellow out at thier choruses.  I wish all heavy bands were like this.  Best album of 2003!!!!!!
B00006RAKP|5.0|As one of the most successful musicians of all time, it was only a matter of time before Elton John would would get a 2 - disc hit s collection spanning his entire career. And while it does leave out quite a few key hits, it's the best collection of his hits so far.<br />Disc 1 contains all the hits from Elton's glory years, the years where everything he touched turned to gold and platinum. Indeed, you can't go wrong with a cd that features &quot;Your Song&quot;, &quot;Rocket Man&quot;, &quot;Crocodile Rock&quot;, &quot;Bennie And The Jets&quot;, &quot;Goodbye Yellow Brick Road&quot;, &quot;Saturday Night's Alright For Fighting&quot; and many other era - defining classics. In fact, if you take this cd and add a few more tracks by The Eagles, Linda Ronstadt, Olivia Newton - John, Barry Manilow, Bread, Rod Stewart, KC And The Sunshine Band, Donna Summer and The Rolling Stones, you'll have a virtual soundtrack to the 1970s'. There aren't really any surprises here, though I was a little shocked (though not all disappointed) that &quot;Levon&quot; and &quot;Tiny Dancer&quot; were included, since neither of them made the top 20 (&quot;Tiny Dancer&quot; didn't even make the top 40).<br />Disc 2 begins with the 1976 number 1 Kiki Duet &quot;Don't Go Breaking My Heart&quot;, before drifting into the 1989s' with the whimsical ballad &quot;Little Jeannie&quot;. The 1980s' were not as big as the 1970s'. Elton only had occasional success, but still scored with hits like &quot;Nikita&quot; and &quot;I Don't Wanna Go On With You Like That&quot;, not to mention &quot;I'm Still Standing&quot;, &quot;Sad Songs (Say So Much)&quot; and &quot;I Guess That's Why They Call It The Blues&quot;. Also included is his criminally underrated ballad &quot;Sacrifice&quot;. The 1990s' were considerably more successful. In 1992, he scored a top 10 hit with the lush title track from his 1992 album &quot;The One&quot;. In 1994, he scored a huge hit with the &quot;Lion King&quot; number &quot;Can You Feel The Love Tonight&quot;, which won him an Oscar for best song along with Time Rice. The film gave him an additional top 20 hit with the stirring &quot;Circle Of Life&quot;. 1995's &quot;Made In England&quot; gave him two more top 40 hits, the haunting ode to love &quot;Believe&quot; and the mystical &quot;Blessed&quot;. And in 1997, he recorded &quot;Something About The Way You Look Tonight&quot;, which became one half of the biggest selling single of all time. After the bland Leann Rimes duet &quot;Written In The Stars&quot;, he rebounded with &quot;I Want Love&quot; and &quot;This Train Don't Stop There Anymore&quot; from the 2001 album &quot;Songs From The West Coast&quot;.<br />The third bonus disc is a special treat. It starts off with the 1986 live version of &quot;Candle In The Wind&quot; from the &quot;Live In Australia&quot; album. While the 1973 version is the one that was a hit singl, peaking at number 6 in 1987. In 1992, Elton went all the way to number 1 with another live recording, duetting with George Michael on &quot;Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me&quot;. This song and &quot;Candle In The Wind&quot; are also on disc 1 in their original studio version. &quot;Live Like Horses&quot; is a haunting duet with Lucianno Pavarotti that sends shivers down your spine. Track 4 is a new version of &quot;Your Song&quot; recordes by Alessandro Safina.<br />This collection is far from complete. There are some songs I would have loved to see here, such as his number 1 hit cover of &quot;Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds&quot;. Or 1979's surprise top 10 hit &quot;Mama Can't Buy You Love&quot;. Or the two hit ballads he scored in 1982, &quot;Empty Garden (Hey Hey Johnny) and &quot;Blue Eyes&quot;. Or his great, underappreciated duble - sided 1976 hit &quot;Grow Some Funk Of Your Own&quot;/&quot;I Feel Like A Bullet (In The Gun Of Robert Ford)&quot;. <BR>Some fans might complain that &quot;Candle In The Wind 1997&quot; has been excluded, but it was left off for obvious personal reasons. Still, this is the best Elton set yet. I highly suggest purchasing it.<br />Update: I just saw an import version of this cd at Sam Goody that has ll the songs plus adds &quot;Blue Eyes&quot;, &quot;Kiss The Bride&quot; and &quot;Song For Guy&quot; to disc 2 and includes a 10 - song third disc including &quot;Pinball Wizard&quot;, &quot;Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds&quot;, and the new hits &quot;Are Yo Ready For Love&quot; and &quot;Sorry Seems To Be The Hardest Word&quot;, the latter featuring some artist named Blue. Get it if you can, as it's slightly more complete.
B000002TQV|5.0|Well... if you haven't heard Ok Computer (shame on you), this would easily be considered their best. But then, ok, so &quot;Ok&quot; probably is their best work, but The Bends is an amazing work on its own. If you like any of Radohead's other albums you will like this one. Undoubtably. No question. Just an amazing album. Nuff Said.
6305558167|1.0|I want two hours of my life back, please. &quot;Excalibur&quot; was total and utter rubbish: badly-acted rubbish, badly-edited rubbish, badly-written, incomprehensible rubbish. I have never seen such unconvincing performances by an entire cast; I have seen high-school productions more effective and moving than this load of pretentious tripe. Helen Mirren, Gabriel Byrne, Patrick Stewart, Cherie Lunghi... what on earth were they thinking?! Only Liam Neeson managed a half-decent performance, and even then he looked embarrassed to be surrounded by scenery-chewing fellow actors like Nigel Terry (surely it's not right when you want to cave in the head of the leading man the moment he appears on screen?), Nicol Williamson (okay, so the silver space helmet was probably not his idea, but surely he can only blame himself for his crappy acting) and whoever it was that played Lancelot. As for John Boorman... I love his&quot;Hope &amp; Glory&quot;, but I'm sorry, this was just embarrassing. <br />AND I can't believe I paid money for this. If you haven't seen it yet, save yourself the agony, please.
B000268QB2|4.0|I happened to hear Keane by chance when I was browsing in a record store and after hearing only half of one song I decided to buy it. It's a very, very good record. I love the singer's voice and the band has great melodies. I have to admit I'm one of the people who thinks this sounds like Coldplay. There are also moments that remind me of older bands like ELO &amp; Queen. I have to hand it to Keane for filling up so much space with just a piano, bass, &amp; drums. I've always been a sucker for bands with minimal instrumentation and these guys have really nailed it. If you're into bands like Coldplay &amp; The Doves you're gonna dig Keane.
0385510438|1.0|This books takes the reader to the very edge of suspense but never produces the thrill.  I kept hoping, until the very last page, to be awarded with the twist or big payoff at the end of the story.  I am a huge fan and normally read a Grisham book in 2 days, this one took me 3 weeks.  I forced myself to finish it because I had woven a web in my mind and wanted to see if I was right.  It turned out my ending was better than the one in the book.  The account of life in a small southern town during the 70's was a pleasant read but not enough to make up for the missing plot and average story.
0060392584|5.0|This was one of the most intriguing books I've read in a really long time.  I was so interested in everything Manson had to say and had a hard time putting the book down.

0375703861|5.0|As I look around my community and the increasing numbers of Asian and Latin American immigrants I wonder if Smith hasn't captured an important perspective on contemporary life in a multicultural world. She tells us that despite the new accents, smells and sounds of our changing world people are pretty much the same. <BR>I picked up the book (audio cassette, actually) after hearing an interview with Smith on the radio. She seemed a bright and insightful young woman. My contemporaries at that age suffer in comparison. <BR>If it were my book I'd have left out the pseudo-science stuff from Professor Chalfin but it's her story, not mine. Hopefully Smith will return to the characters in a few years. I'd love to hear from Irie when she is forty or fifty years old.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|This show rocks.  I didn't watch while it was on the air, and I am really sorry because it deserves to have ratings and to stay on the air.  I have one episode left to watch and then a long dry spell until the movie next year.  Someone pick this back up and put it back on the air!
B000002KIE|4.0|Yeah, well all this punk talk about whether or not the pistols are punk just seems silly to me. You don't decide the music is punk, if its punk it'll come to you. And so what if the band was built on image, there are still some good classic raw songs in this album and who can tell me that they don't see some perks in the eye candy. Anyway, there's still some great music in that album and that's what should matter when you buy it so yeah i would recommend getting it.
B000005HFH|5.0|This is great collection of singin' Chet Baker. Songs featured here are from 1953 to 1956. Some of them were issued on compilation &quot;Young Chet&quot; with Chet playing trumpet and the same personel. This collection contains some his most famous interpretations, including &quot;My Funny Valentine,&quot; &quot;Time After Time,&quot; &quot;There Will Never Be Another You,&quot; and &quot;Let's Get Lost&quot;. Beautiful! If you like Chet singin' you should have this one.

B0000844I8|3.0|Stargate, as a film, is really a solid example of imaginative science fiction. The characters are a little cardboard-y, and the plot is, of course, wholly unbelieavble (as is the norm for science fiction, though!)...Overall, though, this film succeeds in being very, very entertaining to watch. Additionally, the entire premise of the film is so original that it was a thoroughly enjoyable - if light - film experience. The ending had something to be desired, but this is still an entertaining movie.<br />Of course, this film really doesn't have much to do with the actual stargate conspiracy, but it is interesting, nonetheless. Kurt Russell does, believe it or not, an excellent job with his role and manages to balance a powerful character in this film.<br />Now, for this DVD. Firstly, the DVD is cheap. That's always a plus. However, all the DVD has on it is the movies: I was pretty much expecting there to be what MOST DVD's have (-ie, traliors, interviews, etc)...I was disappointed to find that this edition did not contain any theatrical trailers. There is, however, a short side-film about the Stargate and the prospect of there even being one.

1592400876|4.0|EATS, SHOOTS &amp; LEAVES is a little breath of fresh air and while it does not seem a book that merits all the hype it is receiving, it is most certainly an entertaining read and an embarrassing reminder to those of us who write and read (or is that &quot;read, and write&quot;?) that punctuation is a notable contributor to the success or failure of the written word.  How many times have we been stopped cold in the progress of an interesting tale when we are confronted with punctuation errors that are so glaringly wrong that the thought processes collapse?<br />Lynne Truss is a fine writer and has found a means to capture our attention (and funny bone) on a subject no one has previously had the insight to address.  In a time when creative writing - poetry and fiction and non-fiction - in this country relies heavily on its own rules, a time when writers often completely ignore grammatical rules for effect, this little volume brings a bit of Anglophilic mirth.  Editors alert!  Recommended reading.
0385491026|3.0|CAT'S EYE is a formative examination of one woman's often-painful childhood memories of bullying and loneliness. Elaine Risley returns to her childhood city of Toronto to participate in an art gallery show displaying her work throughout her career as a &quot;painter.&quot; Upon arriving Elaine is at once confronted with Toronto's transformations since her youth and thus she engages in a thorough revisiting of her childhood memories in this city. After the Risley family relocates to Toronto after living a vagabond lifestyle in the north, Elaine becomes acquainted with a group of schoolgirls that are often cruel and unfriendly under their innocent exteriors portrayed to others.<br />Margaret Atwood performs a magnificent feat of displaying the complexity and convoluted nature of relationships between young girls and women. The sections pertaining to Elaine's childhood are often painful and frank in their honesty. While reading I couldn't help feeling empathy for Elaine while simultaneously being strangely comforted in my realization that my own strained relationships with women are not unique. But despite these factors I failed to enjoy this book as a whole. Once Elaine reached high school I felt the narrative lost steam, became unexciting, and was often bogged down with unneccessary details and painful minutiae of the setting resulting in my careful skimming of the last half and a sour taste in my mouth. Nevertheless, although this isn't by far my favorite Atwood book, it is still worth reading for the aspects outlined above.
0312335164|1.0|Dan Brown is not a good writer. He can build suspense, but his prose displays his knowledge of cliches more than any facility with language or character development. That said, I enjoyed The Da Vinci Code and--up to a point--Angels and Demons.<br />Digital Fortress, however, was incredibly disappointing. The plot and the actions of the characters make no sense. And once again, Brown hammers home the message that organizations always mean well, but evil deeds belong to individuals. (The heroine's protestations are almost laughable, they're so naive.) This novel highlighted the fact that Brown writes with a formula, and not one that's very successful. Basically, if you've read one Dan Brown book, you've read them all. And I don't recommend reading this one.
B000099T2L|3.0|The first three songs on this cd are great, but after that its like... Zzzzzz Zzzzzzz Zzzzzzz! They all sounded pretty much the same to me. But it was worth the buy I guess for the first 3 which are all hits.
B0001MDP3G|5.0|In addition to the romantic theme (which was beautifully and faithfully portrayed) I believe that the devastation of war and all of it's consequences, both to human spirits, as well as, the ravaged land during and after a war, is very realistically illuminated. As I abhor violence, some parts were difficult for me to watch; I vote that those parts of the movie be shown to students who are learning about this black period of our country's history. Unlike video games containing &quot;violence,&quot; these events really happened! So did World War II, Viet Nam, the Middle East &quot;theaters&quot; etc.etc.etc. On a more positive note, the unravaged scenery of The Smokeys and the music were exquisite and memorable. We watched a rented copy; I will purchase the movie and the book.
B0000DD7LB|3.0|Let me start by saying I am 39. I like all kinds of music. I am not a Britney \\"fan\\", but I do like some of her songs. I LOVE \\"Toxic\\" and \\"Everytime\\" from this cd. I don't appreciate the trashy style she has aquired, but that is her choice - I judge song by song, not by what she is wearing or doing in her personal life. My 9 year old daughter used to be a fan, but she is smart enough to see that Britney is not a good role model for her. Still, we enjoy some of her songs.<br />If a cd has at least 3 songs I really like, then I feel it was worth the money. \\"Against the Music\\" is decent, but \\"Toxic\\" and \\"Everytime\\" are definately my favorites. Some of the songs I skip over, but I like the cd all in all.<br />Now, for some people to \\"review\\" this cd based on her personal life or choices rather than the music itself is ridiculous. And just because a person doesn't like her music personally does not make it crap. I don't like all of her music, but I can be honest to say that I love some of her songs. I can't stand Bruce Springsteen, but I don't call his music crap - I just think its boring, but I don't feel the need to trash him on the internet.<br />(...) Someone who might want to buy the album has to sift through all the Britney haters and Britney supporters to get to a decent album review.
B0001AP12G|5.0|This CD is easily the best cd that has been put out this year.  It makes MASTA KILLA'S cd look like garbage, even thought MASTA KILLA'S cd did that without Kanye's help.  Anyway the best song on the CD has to be JESUS WALKS-there is no other song out that can be compared to it.  If you dont like this CD you are retared, and that goes for the B!+h(BKNY ) that uses the dumbest phrase imaginable (wick-wick-wiggedy-wack)only a complete and utter moron would use a phrase like that-and he has the oudasity to say it twice.  Don't listen to BKNY's review because it's horrendous.  Kanye's debut cd is the best CD of the year, HANDS DOWN!(...)
6304712944|1.0|Awful, awful, awful. Overacting run amok in a silly, unnecessary movie. The worst part was that it looked like a lot of effort went into this film and how horrible was the effort.  What a waste of time. AWFUL.
B000002BFZ|5.0|Many people are eager to dismiss Pearl Jam as a thing of the past.  After all, the grunge era died out years ago.  However, when released in 1996, Pearl Jam's 'No Code' made it clear that they were something more than a grunge band.  They were something with lasting appeal and something that was more musically experimental and influential than 'Ten' may have purported.<br />'No Code' is Pearl Jam's finest.  Starting with the laid-back 'Sometimes', the record tears through 'Hail Hail', one of the many highlights of the album.  The uplifting 'Who You Are' and the following self-examination in the form of 'In My Tree' are wonderful.  Perhaps the only lowpoint of the record is the segue from the gorgeous 'Off He Goes' to the roaring 'Habit'.  'Present Tense' contains some of the best lyrics of the decade.  &quot;You can't spend your time alone redigesting past regrets.  And you can't come to terms and realize you're the only one who cannot forgive yourself.  It makes much more sense to live in the present tense.&quot;  Lyrics such as those are one of the many elements of this record that make it have such a lasting appeal.  Pearl Jam's radio staples like 'Betterman', 'Alive', and 'Jeremy', while all great songs, do not have the lasting appeal that nearly every song on this album does.  It is a masterpiece and should be owned by anyone with even the slightest interest in Pearl Jam.  Even if you are trying to decide between 'Ten' and 'No Code', choose 'No Code'.
B0001LJC2K|5.0|This is the best Cd that has ever and ever will come out. Songs like Sing For Absolution, and Hystaria have kept me joyfully reeling. They can play beautifullly, they can play hard, they can do it all. I encourage all of you to buy this album and every one they make. The British invasion is here and I for one am happy for it. MUSE, Snow Patrol, Coldplay, and Franz Fredinand are just a few to be named,but Muse is far beyond the others. I listen to Absolution 3 times a day and love every second of it. Our Time Is Running Out is the first single that i had ever heard from them, and I just went crazy for it. Matt Bellamy is sooo pasionate about what he does that it makes you feel the song when you hear it. It takes you away from where you are to somewhere amasingly beautiful. Some people complain that this awesome band is just copying Radiohead. Riding on their coattails as it were, but Muse is so differant i wonder why they compare them to Radiohead at all. yes they are good, and yes Matt kinda sounds like him, but that is no reason to point the finger and say they are copy cats and they suck. I like Radiohead but it is songs like Huricanes and Butterflys that blows them out of the water. No more comparing this work of art to Radiohead.  They asked me to rate this item on a scale to 5, but that is impossible. It excedes any scale there is. to sum up, Absolution is: the best, amazing, beautiful, and nothing can ever come close(unless they make another one,PLEASE DO MUSE!!!!)Thank you.
0767817648|3.0|An iron-plated Huey gunship with duel-mounted .50 caliber machine guns threatens to destroy the world.  Only Roy Sheider can save the day by hanging off a flagpole on the side of a building and firing a rifle at Blue Thunder's gas tank, causing the shark to explode and then Sheriff Brody has to swim back to shore with a guy who has been &quot;counting money all [his] life&quot;.  Something like that.  Blue Thunder had slightly less appeal than the hit tv series &quot;Airwolf&quot; (starring critically acclaimed alcoholic wife-beater, Jan Michael Vincent).  As the film moves toward the end, you will look back and realize that the woman getting naked in the first 15 minutes of the movie was the best part ... and you will want to rewind it and watch that part again.  If Popeye, Iron Eagle, and Red Dawn are in your movie collection, you may as well round it off and purchase Blue Thunder as well.
B00013F38K|5.0|The last time I saw this series was when it was originally on TV<BR>and as I was doing homework at the time,I remember it only got<BR>done during the commercials of this show.  It still has the same effect today - it is captivating.  There are some corny spots but<BR>for the most part it is a great dramatic and action series.  It fills up most of my tv screen and although I'm sure the techno wizards must be right about being cropped and cut, I don't feel like I'm missing anything.  The packaging is very nice and quality great- There's no reason to complain. Thanks to Warner <BR>Brothers for putting this out.  If you're an original fan like me<BR>you're going to like what you see!
B0000683DH|5.0|MAKE IT THIS ONE.  This is it...the movie that defined that reinvented Star Trek in the 80's and paved the way back to television for Star Trek: The Next Generation.  <br />Why you'll like it:<BR>Shatner and Nimoy: No matter how you slice it, there is a chemistry between these two people (both off and on screen) that makes you want to watch them together.<br />Ricardo Montalban:  The man &quot;chews scenery&quot;.  Khan is one of the great villians.<br />GREAT special effects:  all cutting edge effect done by Lucas' Industrial Light and Magic.  It was done sooo well - like they were going out of there way to apologize for the visual trainwreck that was Star Trek: The Motion Picture.<br />And - if you don't like Star Trek - it's still pretty good fun.<br />I won't spoil the ending - but keep the tissues handy.  No one can keep a dry eye when you hear bagpipes playing &quot;Amazing Grace&quot;.<br />I also really enjoyed watching this film with the director's commentary.  I actually got a whole new perspective on the film from the first time I saw it (more than 20 years ago).
B0002858YS|4.0|Every song is unique, it's not one of those albums that sounds like variations of the same song. The first 6 songs flow nicely and it is a great CD to work out to.
B000006TRV|5.0|a warning this album will be very addictive for any listener as it is so good.highly recommended.a masterpiece.buy,buy,buy.
B0000DJZ8R|5.0|This DVD restoration is probably as good as possible given that the original camera negative was lost.  This is the one to get.  <br />By the way, there is NO widescreen version of &quot;The Grapes of Wrath.&quot;  This DVD release exhibits the full frame aspect ratio of the original (1.33 to 1 ratio).   Essentially, films made between 1917 and 1952 were filmed with a full frame aspect ratio.  Standard televisions were proportioned 4:3 to copy the standard cinema ratio. Widescreen (Cinemascope, etc) was a gimmick introduced by Hollywood in the 1950s to compete with television. So if a film was made between 1917 and 1952 don't go looking for a widescreen version of it because there isn't any!
B00005O5CM|5.0|This movie is one of my favorites.  It's a fish-out-of-water comedy about a feminine, ditzy (but actually quite smart) sorority girl, Elle Woods (Witherspoon), who goes to Harvard Law School to get her boyfriend back.  She ends up realizing that she's a lot smarter than people give her credit for, and succeeding beyond everyone's expectations including her own.  The movie is hilarious the whole way through, and Witherspoon plays her part just perfectly.  This is also one of those movies, at least for me, that you can watch over and over again and not get tired of it.  I recommend everyone who enjoys comedy to watch this!
B000003TA4|1.0|I never really liked the hair bands of the late 1980's. They always seemed a little too goofy for a die-hard headbanger like me. I liked some of them, though. And at least they were keeping the metal spirit alive. But then in early '92, Nirvana hit. I hated them from the start. They killed off all metal had been in the 1980's. They sang about dumb subjects like how depressed that idiotic Kurt Cobain was and teenage angst. Who the hell wants to hear about that? Besides, it started a revolution of horrible nu metal, pop punk, and alternative bands that would still be flowing today if it weren't for band like The Darkness and Andrew WK. This is a stinking pile of putrid trash. I hate everyone who was in this band with all my heart.
6305144176|4.0|Robin Williams, one of my favorite actors, is great as the crazy DJ who shakes things up for the soldiers of Vietnam.  With his ability to do so many voices, love the Cronkite, and also his talent to convey some of the most diverse emotions, Robin Williams leads the movie.  William's character is a radio dj, as I mentioned, who seems in his own world, and happy with it.  Yet, with the violence of vietnam but also it's appeal, which to him is the Vietnamese people themselves, he is torn.  One of the more uplifting stories about Vietnam this movie is very good and very funny, as only William's, even early in his career, can be.
B000062YB1|5.0|Another hard-pounding realse from the kings of dark thrash metal, Slayer. Just everything about it rocks you like there is no tomorrrow. Tom's voice has the typical Tom sound to it, and Kerry and Jeff's soloing is no less great. The lyrics are cool, too. The last track is the title song, which in my opinion is the greatest Slayer song ever written. Other standout tracks on this masterpiece include &quot;Dead Skin Mask', and 'War Ensemble'.
0156027321|5.0|The first time I read this book was for myself hearing it had garnered so much critical acclaim - the second time was for my first year University english course; though I understood the book fairly well the first time, it isn't until the second reading that I actually got all the subtelties Martel weaves in this story.<br />Contrary to some of the other reviews I've seen here, I found that the allegorical and philosophical arguments that were layered throughout to be just enough under the surface to require a careful piecing together.  Once that was done I saw the story for what Martel attempted to make it - a deep and suspiciously well thought-out tapestry dealing with the experiences that define our person, and in Pi's case, the death of his person.<br />With so many different angles occuring at once (except, unfortunately, for long portions on the boat, in which some of the effect of the religious sections of the book fail) it is difficult to determine not only the reality as Pi sees it, but the reality as Martel attempts to display it.  Why else would he claim that the story is real? Creating a real Pi who survived the real ordeal of travelling the Pacific?  Why pour so much diversity into Pi if not to highlight that diversity can exist within an individual, so long as that individual's reality allows it?  These are the questions that were constantly raised in my mind as I read Life of Pi, and even more so as I re-read it.<br />Ultimately I found the book to be a faint supposition of some of the topics plauging our modern society - a far more timid version of a Salmaan Rushdie novel, with perhaps a more condescending attitude.
B000068R1X|5.0|This is the sound that Ozzy should have never left alone. It's great! He uses substantial use of synthesizers and keyboards, along with the impossibly heavy crunch-crunch of Jake E Lee's guitar playing. Also, Ozzy's singing sounds better than on Diary Of a Madman, which I feel is Ozzy's worst album. This is the best Ozzy album to ever be released. Although his later albums like No Rest For The Wicked and No More Tears are still five-star albums, he should have never lefy this sound behind him and I think it is one of the definitive metal albums.
0780622650|4.0|I grew up on Lost In Space so I stayed away from this flick for years, but it was on cable one day so I gave it a look and I'll be darned if it wasn't GREAT! Sure it's cheesy as all get out, but heck so was the original show. I loved it. They added some more drama, but they kept the idea that Lost In Space should be a cheesy entertainment for kids. They added tons of modern FX, but they didn't kill the heart or fun of the original idea. It's impossible for me to hate this movie. I was afraid they'd take out all of the fun and make it so called adult sci-fi (zzzzzzzz), but they kept it goofy. Too bad these folks weren't around for Battlestar Galactica the remake (zzzzzzz).
B000002H33|3.0|I feel this is Metallica's last album worth listening to. The follow-up album, And Justice For All's production was a wreck, and after that they went alternative (Can u say 'sellout'?) But on this last album with original bassist Cliff Burton, the band thrashes hard. The band covers all subjects on the album from money in 'Leper Messiah', drugs in the title track, war in 'Disposable Heroes', and big things marching around in 'The Thing That Should Not Be'.
B00000JLWW|5.0|one of the best movies ever made. visually stunning. superb acting. beautiful costume design. highly reccommended...titanic is the best!
B000000XK5|3.0|It's not that it's a bad CD or anything, it's just not the greatest.  The recording dates of the sessions of this CD are probably the most important parts to take notice of: 1983 and 1986.  This means that Ms. Fitzgerald was fairly old, and her health was not the greatest at this time, and it shows a little bit on the record.  On a few songs she's just out of tune, and sounds old.<br />Mr. Pass' playing is up to its usual snuff, of course; just simple, easy-sounding playing that carries the tune without overdoing it.<br />There are better records of Ella Fitzgerald with Joe Pass, if this is what one is looking for; Fitzgerald &amp; Pass...Again, for example, is pretty nice.
B000063DFN|5.0|Im going to start by saying this album is in my top 5 favorite cds and i have over 100. <br />1. Aces High: This starts the album off with a bang. The guitar riffing is fast, high pitched, and adrenline pumping, not a very heavy song, but still metal and just as good.There is also a great solo by Dave Murray. You'll like this song if you like faster, higher pitched, metal songs. 10/10<br />2. Two Minutes to Midnight: This was Maidens highest single of this album and for good reason, it has a cool riff and a very catchy chorus. Bruce dickinson does a pretty good vocal performance on this song. The guitar riff is much like Ted Nugent's Stormtrooping.   10/10<br />3. Losfer Words (Big Orra):This was Maidens last instrumenatal,<BR>and unfortunatly it was not another Ghengis Khan. It has a fast heavy Prog Rock Sounding riff to it, this song is complety unique and I haven't heard anything like it. 8/10<br />4. Flash of the blade: The song starts out with a unusual riff that sound like it could be part of a Ozzy Osbourne guitar solo.<BR>when the lyrics start both guitarists do your typical iron maiden power cord riffing. There is a cool sychronized solo played in octaves in the guitar bridge. 8/10<BR>                            <br />5. The Duellists. Starts off with more heavy guitar riffing. Steve Harris plays his bass great in this song, providing a good backup sound in the chorus and the guitar solo that follows. Some parts of this song are very heavy, other parts are filled with melody, and in some parts there is both. There is an excellent guitar bridge and solo.  9/10   <br />6. Back in the Village: It's a decent song but it pales in comparison to all the other songs, it has a really wierd sounding main riff. When the guitar solo starts at 2:30 the song gets really good with good riffs and a guitar solo.  7/10 but 9/10 for the solo<br />7. Powerslave: This is the secound best song on the album, the opening guitar riff is fast, galloping, and vicous sounding. Then itgets even better during the chorus when the riff changes into something even nastier and faster then the opening one. After the secound chorus the song complety mellows out into a slow beatiful guitar solo, this goes on for a minute then the drums kick in and in launches a fast, powerful, absoluty rocking guitar solo, with Steve Harris's Bass loudly playing along in a catchy little rhythm during the solos.<BR>                                               11/10<br />8. Rime of the Ancient Mariner. The album ends with one maidens finest songs ever. Every single memmber of the band shines on this song, there are more good guitar riffs in this song then on any 10 Nu-Metal albums, nevermind make that 20 albums, i kinda forgot how bad nu-metal is. This song is complety fasicnating and still amazes me. The whole album is worth the price just for this 14 minute epic masterpiece.<BR>13/10<br />Sorry if you didn't understand me or i rambled on, but i just love this album, buy it! <br /> <BR> Please tell me what you thought of my review by pressing yes or no, im just curious to see if i was helpful at all. Thanks for reading.<br />and one other thing listen to wrathchild (the reviewer below me.) he is absoluty right about everything he said, screw king diamond and all that satanic sh*t.
B000060P79|5.0|Simple PLan is the best pop-punk band to hit the stages yet ! GC is great too but simple plan just blows anybody out of the water with there greeat vocals and guitar is just amazing! this music just gets you pumped ! u get so much energy and the songs each and every one of them is great ! and for all the ppl that think simple plan isnt punk ? you guys are just mad because simple plan is getting more fame than your bands ! so stop hating on them because their famous !

SIMPLE PLAN ROCKS !!
B00005U8EM|5.0|Phil Connors is a real piece of work.  He is a weatherman based in Pittsburgh, whose sarcasm, egotism, and cynicism repel most of the people he meets.  He is on assignment for the fourth year in a row, covering another Phil--Punxsutawney Phil, the groundhog who every year, on February 2, prognosticates how long winter will last.  Along with Connors are his producer, Rita, played by the lovely Andie MacDowell, and his long-suffering and much abused cameraman, Larry, played hilariously by Chris Elliott.<br />Phil hates the groundhog, whom he calls a rat, he hates the people of Punxsutawney, whom he considers little more than boring hicks, and he hates people who are warm and sensitive.  Phil is counting the seconds until he can leave this miserable town and get back to the big city.  Little does he know that a quirky act of fate will doom him to relive February 2nd, over and over and over again, until he gets it right.<br />Bill Murray is comic perfection as the cranky and impatient Phil, a person who could not stop and smell the roses if his life depended on it.  Thanks to a brilliant screenplay by Danny Rubin and Harold Ramis, who also directed, Murray has ample opportunity to show off his impeccable timing and priceless facial expressions.  Whether he is greeting his unctuous landlady at his bed and breakfast, trying to fend off a pushy old classmate, or smoothly convincing a gullible woman that he loves her, Murray nails this self-absorbed and misanthropic character.<br />The look of epiphany on Phil's face when he realizes that he can do whatever he wants with no repercussions is unforgettable.  Since he is doomed to live the same day over and over again, he can hit on women endlessly, spend money like water, and eat as many cholesterol-laden desserts as his heart desires.  Soon, however, the novelty wears off, and Phil begins to realize that the same-old, same-old is no longer bearable.  To move his life past Groundhog Day, he will have to change inside, where it counts.<br />If you want to laugh until you cry, see &quot;Groundhog Day,&quot; a film that is destined to become a comedy classic.it counts.<br />If you want to laugh until you cry, see &quot;Groundhog Day,&quot; a film that is destined to become a comedy classic.
B00005JMX4|5.0|This movie is my 2nd favorite movie of all time, the first being Freddy Vs. Jason.  (Both having Christopher Marquette, weird).  I had to see this the weekend of its release.  My friends went with me, but even if they didn't want to, I'd of still gone.  This movie rocks!  I can't stop thinking about it all, or at least as much as I caught while I wasn't laughing.  This movie will be added to my DVD collection when it comes out.  I have to buy this and my family has to see it.  It is the greatest teen sex comedy ever.  My dad believes American Pie is, but he hasn't seen this yet.  It is hilarious, but not as over the top as it could've been, thanx MPAA.  I wish that they wouldn't interfere with great movies, but they do.  Oh well, we'll have to make the best of it.  This movie has a very believable cast and helped push me back in the path of the occupation I wanted, film director, so that I could make movies this (...)GOOD!  I have my list of the top 5 movies in this exact order, 1. Freddy Vs. Jason, 2. The Girl Next Door, 3. The Evil Dead, 4. Scarface, 5. Super Troopers.  That is my list and I'm stickin' to it.  This movie is great for the whole family, even 5 year olds.  I'd let my children watch this no matter the age.  A movie destined to high sales and become an ultimate classic.  <br />P.S. <BR>I like this movie even more that Elisha Cuthbert is in it, because she is one of the finest women I have ever seen.
B00005RFVL|5.0|Robbie Williams is a great singer. I love how he takes his music and make is funny. This cd is a great cd. I have all of his cd's and I would say this is one of the best one.
B0000019PA|5.0|This is my favorite album of all time. Better that Chiastic Slide, better than the Mollusk. This is it. I bought it on a whim having only heard the Amazon clips. I was hooked. This is the album that I put on less then an hour after my first and only girlfriend broke up with me less then two hours ago in my apartment. This is one of the few things in life that actually makes it worth living. Thank you Jeff.
B00008MNYS|5.0|Out of all of his cd's this is the best one. I love the songs Monsoon, Feel, Me and my Monkey Handsom Man Nan's Song and Love Somebody. He is a very strange man but he has a great voice. I am suprised he is not bigger in the states. I live in the United Kingdom and this man is huge over here. I love all of his cd's but i would say this is the best one there. Cant wait for the new one to come out.
B00006BTCA|5.0|Ian Curtis-obsessed american miserabilists with a penchant for all things dark, introspective and generally Mancunian. Desn't sound like much fun does it? Thankfully there is much, much more to Interpol than there was to their angst-ridden heroes.<br />Melodically superb, with a hint of the Smiths'jangle, tight machine-like drumming, dark yet light vocals, all sympathetically produced. Unlike many of the current crop of bands in that they are influenced by the past, but not attempting to replicate it.<br />Turn on the Bright Lights is an instant classic. If you don't get it listen to it again and again until you do. It's worth the effort.
B00005RFVL|5.0|Robbie Williams is a great singer. I love how he takes his music and adds humor. This cd is a great cd. I have all of his cd's and I would say this is one of the best one.
B00006879E|4.0|I bought this CD quickly after finding out that a mysterious song that played only late at night was performed by this awesome band hailing from Los Angeles. Shortly after I invested in their first album \\"Fourth World\\", which they released when they were only four members and known as Kara's Flowers, which was considered a collector's item at the time.  Almost a year later, Maroon 5's success is soaring, the mystery song \\"Harder to Breathe\\" has gotten continuous airplay, they've released another single \\"This Love\\" and the album \\"Songs About Jane\\" has gone platinum. <br />I have seen them three times live in concert and can say they are fantastic, and their appearance is nothing short of matching their laid-back, funky sounds. Their sexually charged lyrics, sung by the unique voice of Adam Levine, and their groovy rythmes can either get you dancing or have you relaxing at home. Motown jive can be heard amidst the ecclectic sounds of Los Angeles. <br />Needless to say, \\"Songs About Jane\\" is an awesome buy, and if you like it enough I encourage you to look into \\"Fourth World\\" to see the lighter roots of this fantastic band.
0812550706|5.0|I happened to pick up Ender's Game one day in the book store of my college. When I first started to read it it didn't sound like anything special, the more I read it the more I liked it. After finishing the book I wanted to read more of the story, craving it. Ender's game is a great book, especially for people who like action and sci-fi and all the other interesting things in the book. This book will most likely leave you thinking for some time (not that it's a bad thing) about the future and how we as the human race will be when it comes to peace and war and all of that polical woo haw. If you like this book, you'll like Ender's shadow (A parallel to Ender's Game). I suggest reading Ender's shadow right after ender's game. I still have not yet read the rest of the series but I will.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|This has to be the  best cd of 2003/2004. Britney is an amazing performer and makes amazing songs and this album proves it. The best tracks all the songs on the album except for early mornin which should have been replaced by &quot;The answer&quot;. Britney cd is so versatile and has awesome beats and good production. Britney seems to improve on each cd she makes. Britney will soon be the Queen of pop an theres no denying it. She will be her for a long time
B00006SFBD|2.0|I bought this cd cause I wanted to see what all the underground hype was about.  I've heard this stuff before.  Melodic Swedish Black Metal...been around since about 1994 and its been done much better.  Its a fine cd for what it is.  But its nothing unique or original.  And thats why I give it 2 stars.  I have about 15 bands just like this one that date back years ago.  Why should I care about these guys.  Find any band thats Swedish and melodic black/death metal and they all sound the same.  Decent music, but not groundbreaking at all.  **
B0000AFOHH|5.0|Melvin H. Wilson, Jr. on 15/07/1997 [Other reviews by Melvin H. Wilson, Jr. ]<br />Although it is the sound track from the movie of the Winter Olympics, &quot;White Rock&quot; is much more than just a sound track album. It is an emotional trip through feelings of triumph and defeat. The title track, &quot;White Rock&quot;, is a busy romp with Rick playing wonderful leads accompanied by grooving percussion. &quot;Searching For Gold&quot; is a very beautiful, haunting piece that brings on the feeling of hope and achievment. &quot;After the Ball&quot; a classical movement with touches of sadness and perhapes loneliness; and &quot;Ice Run&quot; that sounds very similar to a &quot;Yes&quot; song. This album is definitely a BUY IT.<BR>.

B00005NOOH|4.0|This kept me going for months (in one hour segments at a time).  There is so much material presented here and I learned a lot.<br />I wanted to give 4.5 stars and only knock a half off for the sometimes annoying menu (it could have been presented in a more orgnaized fashion, I thought), or other small problems, but half points aren't allowed on the system.  Very close to perfect!
0790742780|5.0|As we journey with Michael Douglas in this excellent film, cant' we all identify with his frustration and anger?  85 cents for a can of soda?  A store that won't give you change unless you buy something?  Panhandlers looking for food, money and making you feel you owe it to them?  People who think gays, blacks and other minorities are worthless?  A fast food place that won't serve you breakfast even when they have tons of left overs they'll have to throw out?  Wealthy old farts who think they own the golf course they pay membership in?<br />Yes, indeed, one can see why Douglas is so mad...it's just that his way of dealing with it is not one that we all should take.<br />Joel Schumacher's direction is right on, I think; people tend to like to pan Schumacher, when he has actually given us some vastly entertaining films.  He knows what the audience wants and he knows that in FALLING DOWN, there can be no happy endings, so let's just enjoy Douglas getting revenge on people we'll never get a chance to!<br />Douglas is superb in the role, one of his best performances.  Robert Duvall is very good in his role of the almost retired cop; Tuesday Weld is dazzling in her brief role as Duvall's wife; Rachel Ticotin does well in her role as Duvall's partner; John Diehl is very effective in his very brief role as the guy at the pool who offers to go with Douglas in order to protect his wife and child; and Barbara Hershey does wonders as Douglas' ex-wife.<br />Manipulative thought it may be, FALLING DOWN makes a statement, and makes one wonder what we would do if we snapped like Douglas!!!
B0000CAXIC|5.0|This cd's for sure one of the Foo Fighter's best albums.  All the songs are really original and a breath of fresh air.  Lyrics are great, sound is great, I can't say anything bad about this album, all the songs are awsome.
B00005JKED|3.0|TRAINING DAY gives Denzel Washington the chance to act his butt off, and that he does in this vile, irreprehensible film.  Washington won an Oscar for his role as Alonzo, a cop gone very, very bad.  Taking the stance that to fight crime, one has to be a criminal, Washington takes us through the paces of a dirty cop who will do anything to achieve his own personal agenda.  What he does to the Sandman is bad enough, but how he sets up his new rookie partner, is abyssmal and out and out vile!  Ethan Hawke is exceedingly good in a role that netted him an oscar nomination as the new rookie who would do anything for his new boss to assure his chances of getting detective ranking.  However, as his training day goes on, Hawke realizes just how corrupt his boss is.<br />The film is slow in the beginning, and by the time it picks up its pace, all I wanted was to see Washington go down.  Tom Berenger, Harris Yulin and Raymond J. Barry are wasted in their roles, but in the extras, we get a deleted scene that really shows what their purpose in the film was.  Why it was taken out is a mystery to me.  The politically correct usage of rappers Dr. Dre & Snoop Dogg and the singer Macy Gray continue to show what's wrong with movies these days:  go for the youth market, even though the three above mentioned performers are not actors, and they are only used to up the box office potential.<br />All in all, this is not what one could call an entertaining movie...it's worth lies in the searing performances of Washington and Hawke.  Just once, too, wouldn't it be nice to see the corrupted cop be revealed to the public for what he was? No, again, we find Washington's death (spoiler here? Not really) eulogied as a good cop going down while trying to serve a high risk warrant.  Cover up cover up.....makes one wonder if there's any cop we can trust?  Come on, movie makers, let's show these guys for what they really are, not beautify their deaths.  Especially when those deaths were justified!!!!!
B00004Z459|1.0|This band and others like it, which is pretty much 90% of the filth they play on the radio, are the one-hit-wonders of today. But now it's more like one-album-wonders. This album has sold what, 8 million copies? Somethng close to going diamond? Who really cares.<br />This music is not good, plain and simple. It appeals to your single digit and teeny bopper kids and your simple, narrow plain of thought, governed by everyone but themselves teenager. This music is simple enough for the obtuse people who listen to the radio and MTV for them to tell you what's &quot;cool&quot;, &quot;hip&quot; or &quot;in&quot;. If I were the parents of these kids, I would do them a favor and kill them, and then myself for failing as a parent.<br />Any dumbass with a guitar can tune to any &quot;dropped tuning&quot; and hit a couple of chords, changing each progression per song by only a little bit. As a matter of fact, turn on your radio and tune it on to your local &quot;metal&quot; or modern rock station and I guarentee you'll hear the same thing under 50 different names; with more band members who just can't face the fact reality isn't what they thought it would be (no thanks to MTV).<br />If the subject matter of topics similar to the rules your gradeschool teacher would tell you appeals to you, then so would this. With all the problems like someone interrupting someone when they are speaking, misbehaving and the hilarity of basic teenage &quot;angst&quot; and rebellion, who needs the basic elements of music that makes it art? Your buddy Kurt Cobain got the picture, maybe you should too.<br />To summarize, bands like this fit an equasion in music similar to 2 + 2 = 4 in math: <br />simple catchy vocals containing your run of the mill problem + mindnumbingly simplistic music (and I use the term &quot;music&quot; loosely) = brainwashing...I mean, money...wait, I mean entertainment :)<br />What the hell happened to good music? What the hell happened to good musicians? Most of all, whatthe hell happened to the solos? You know what, don't play solos at all, don't even go past the 12th fret and don't even touch the first three strings, we don't need you to ruin everything. But wait, Godsmack ruined soloing, silly me I forgot.<br />All I can say is that as a musician, this band puts people who put all their time and effort into practicing to become a good player to shame. This band thrusts the people who work the hardest further into the ground, never to see the light of day. These shallow people in these telentless bands appeal to you shallow minded fans who can't comprehend the least complex of complex music. <br />You all make me sick.
B00000DR5I|5.0|Phaedra helped make Tangerine Dream in to one of the big-name electronic acts, after releasing four bizarre, experimental albums in the early '70s for Ohr. The success of Phaedra was actually pretty unexpected, and from listening to that album, you can see why. But the band had little problem following up that album and they proceeded to give us another classic, in this case Rubycon. And since they were known for side-length cuts, they decided to make this album basically one cut that takes up both side, with only Part 1 and Part 2 dividing the sides. Pretty much picks up where Phaedra left off. The album starts off with some nice, stunning Mellotron work with great electronic effects before the band goes in to sequencer overdriver. Eventually it fades, and the use of prepared piano pokes its head. The second half starts off with the sounds of air raid sirens before going back to the sequencers, before going in to a more dreamy passage dominated by Edgar Froese' Mellotron flute. This album is another must have for electronic music fans.

B000001ZS5|4.0|Le Chantes Magnetiques (Magnetic Fields) was really Jarre fifth or so album, not third, since he released a couple albums before Oxygene in the early '70s (for example, Deserted Palace in 1972), and singles as far back as 1970 (\\"La Cage\\"). But since most people never heard anything he's done before Oxygene (because those albums are so hard to come by), most simply regard Oxygene as his debut. Magnetic Fields continues more or less in the same vein as Oxygene and Equinox, except now more emphases is put on rhythm. He also got himself some new digital equipment, in this case a Fairlight, which was the first digital sampler. Made in Australia, and introduced in 1979, it was basically a keyboard with a computer-type monitor and a light pen. The rest of the synthesizers on this album are actually analog (like then-state-of-the-art polyphonic, as well as his old stuff from the '70s), as the first true digital synthesizer wouldn't appear until 1983 with the infamous Yamaha DX-7 (which Jarre happily used starting with Zoolook). Aside from the Fairlight and polyphonic synths, he was still using his ARP 2600 and EMS synths, although he seemed to cut back on his Eminent (an organ-like instrument with the sound of a string synth, as heard on Oxygene). The album starts off with \\"Part 1\\". This was the very first time he ever did a side-length cut, and this piece succeeds. It's kinda strange that he'll be doing that in an era where many other acts, both electronic, and the few prog rock bands that survived to the 1980s, had pretty much given up on side-length cuts (in favor of more pop-oriented material). The classic Jarre sound is still there, with lots of emphasis on rhythm. \\"Part 2\\" gets bogged down by annoying electronic handclap sounds, while \\"Part 3\\" features some kalimba-like sounds (presumably from the Fairlight itself) while at the same time harkening back to the likes of Oxygene with the Eminent. But I always felt \\"Part 5 (The Last Rhumba)\\" was the album's real low-point. He seems to always fall flat when he tries to explore world music with his electronic style (for example the Caribbean steel-drum laced calypso influence of the first three cuts on En Attendant Cousteau aka Waiting For Cousteau). Here, of course, he's going for Latin music, Jarre style, that means entirely on electronic equipment, synthesizers and drum machines. Aside from the final cut, it's nice to see Jarre entering the new decade (the 1980s) without much problems. To me, this is his best '80s, but for those new to Jarre, start with Oxygene and Equinoxe.
0446607274|5.0|I am never disappointed when I read a Bosch book by Connelly.  This was another I couldn't put down.  This isn't just a story of a cop in LA. This is a story of his life. How he handles his job and his personal life. Usually one of them is falling apart.  I have come to really like Bosch. I admire Connelly for his ability to pull in characters from the past and play them out. This book starts off with the murder of a high profile lawyer who was representing a man suing the police department for abuse.  It takes off from there.  Twists and turns you don't expect. I highly recommend this series.  They are hard to put down.
B0001Z52RU|5.0|i saw this movie in the theater and it was awesome.. the special effects were great and the story line made you think i was jumping out of my seat a few times lol if you like ashton you will be pleasently surprised he did a great job in a serious role and he deserves credit for that...
B00003CX5P|1.0|I love Star Wars, Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi. I think that George Lucas should have stopped there. The two movies: The Phantom Menace and the Attack of the Clones....SUCK! What was George Lucas thinking? Jar Jar Binks needs to tossed off the face of the earth, and Hayden Christansen (while hot), needs to take some acting lessons. Not enough special effects in the world could make me want to see the third release. Poor acting and writing have made me want to run for cover! Where's the FORCE when you need it?
B000000OSG|5.0|While some argue over which Use Your Illusion album is better, in reality there both well matched, I cant decide which is the winner of the 2. And there both kick ass rock n roll albums. If youre going to purchase one of the Illusion albums then you have to get both for the complete experience. But if youre relativley new to Guns N' Roses then I highly recommened th original Appetite For Destruction for the best start. But anyways Illusion 2 is a great album. Its got all the nessecary items. Civil War, Shotgun Blues, You Could Be Mine, 14 years, and Pretty Tied Up, are the more heavy songs, while Knockin On Heavens Door, So Fine, Estranged, and the alternate lyrics of Dont Cry will be the more emotional ones but still keeping the rock n roll groove. (In my opinion the original lyrics for dont cry are better, but its still good)To me Breakdown and Yesterdays are just average, but still worth the listen. The only track I could care less about is My World, if its even a song. And a word of caution, STAY AWAY from the mix of both album, It doesnt give you the whole experience, only the hit songs, and you'll be missing out on so much. So go pick up your opy of both Use Your Illusion 1 and 2 and I can guarantee you wont be dissapointed. Definetley worth a listen. G'.N'F.'nR.'s
B00001MXXH|5.0|This movie is one of my all time favorites.  Who hasn't seen this movie?  It rocks!  Funny and clever from start to finish.  The commentary is great too.
B00005JLT5|5.0|Even though barely deserving a rebuttal, some of the reviews here are so beyond asinine that I cannot restrain myself, particularly with regard to those reviewers who had the gall to call Mr. Szpilman a coward. Mr. Szpilman risked immediate death every time he helped to smuggle a weapon or ammunition into the ghetto. The ghetto uprising itself was essentially a suicide mission, and everyone involved probably knew that. So Mr. Szpilman was a coward because he wanted to live, then? How dare you. While I don't believe that any work of art should be above criticism no matter what its subject matter, I have not read a single negative review here that has any remotely intelligent criticism of this film whatsoever.  They pretty much describe it as &quot;boring&quot; or &quot;another Holocaust movie.&quot; Schmucks. One reviewer couldn't even remember the protagonist's name, yet had no shortage of would-be scathing things to say about the movie. Almost as absurd are the unfavorable comparisons to &quot;Schindler's List.&quot; Yes, Oskar Schindler was a great man, but the very straightforward good vs. evil nature of the subject matter must have appealed to Steven Spielberg's very American sensibilities. &quot;The Pianist,&quot; on the other hand, boldly treads a ground that is decidedly messier, morally less clear-cut, and I think that only a man like Roman Polanski, who understands the particular time and place where these events transpired, could have made this film. And Adrien Brody fully deserved the Academy Award for this performance. And, yes, he does spend a good deal of time searching like a &quot;rat&quot; for food. What do these buffoons think it means to survive in such an environment? Idiots. Anyhow, this film is a masterpiece, an artistic triumph of the highest rank. The naysayers have not been able to level a single legitimate criticism against it.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|I admit, when I first read the summaries, I thought &quot;Demonic Rabbit vs. Troubled teenager. What the heck?&quot; But then a worker at Blockbuster suggested it, so I thought &quot;Why not give it a try?&quot; Don't let the weird summary fool you. I was spellbound from the first second. The dark moments, creepy special effects, realistic teens, and especially the subtle comedy [hint: the smurf monologue is PRICELESS}- all of this makes Donnie Darko worth it. Jake Gylenhaal is a rising star who will bring more than mysterious good looks to the Hollywood scene. I only have one real comment: Check out the movie. Everyone has to see it once.
B000294SFW|5.0|I have to say when i bought the album i wasnt expecting it to be that great having heard likes of overkill and bomber but as soon as i put the cd in and heard terminal show i was taken back this is true metal, the riffs are really catchy and really influential i cant belive motorhead are still going and producing albums as good as the ones that made them famous in the first place if you like old motorhead get this album i have yet to see anyone saying that it is not good this is a credit to motorhead and i cannot wait to see them live in november go Motorhead
B00009V7RF|2.0|I can't believe the glowing reviews for this album here. I read them, and once I got the album, I was utterly disappointed. The first time I listened to it I thought it was ok, but after having it for 5 months I have deleted every song from my playlist except &quot;Hands Up&quot; and &quot;Let's Get Retarded.&quot; These aren't even good songs, they're just catchy. The &quot;funk&quot; influenced songs sound forced and repetitive, and some of the songs flat out suck. With &quot;Elephunk,&quot; the Black-Eyed Peas have gone from a respectable &quot;Roots&quot;-like psuedo-underground outfit to a weak, commercial, radio-friendly, Justin Timberlake-featuring crew. If this album was so tight, it wouldn't have so many positive reviews on amazon.com
B000007T2Z|5.0|GYBE!'s debut is almost entirely in a league of its own. The group's later releases such as Lift Your Skinny Fists would see the group become more musical, but this album is just as classic as that, if not more so, its post-apocalyptic soundscapes as beautiful as they are terrifying.<br />Believe me, this album is not for the faint of heart or for those who prefer their songs to come with lyrics or tidily end after only a few minutes. Godspeed have instead painted portraits of abandoned cities and desolate wastelands using nothing more than their own instruments.<br />Indeed, the effect of the album is not unlike listening to the soundtrack to a film that's had its vocal tracks removed or lost, leaving the plot to be determined by the listener's imagination, and the few found-sound vocal clips utilized by the group for atmospheric purposes. (The most noteworthy of these being the street preacher that opens the album's second track.)<br />Perhaps Godspeed's greatest accomplishment with this album is just how emotional it is. Godspeed know very well that lyrics aren't needed to provide emotional depth to music and prove it ably in the album's tracks. Beautiful strings gradually build up to cathartic wails before dropping out. Faded-out pianos suggesting a long-lost Old West tavern rise from nowhere. Unhuman voices overpower the listener before transforming into the powerless buzz of a fly.<br />Those with open minds or a like of experimentation owe it to themselves to get this straightaway. Otherwise, Lift Your Skinny Fists provides a much better (and much less harrowing) introduction to the group's work.
B000002UJQ|5.0|I was at target the other day and was looking at their collection of classic CDs and this was one of them. i have been looking for this CD for a good price now for a while and i found it at target. I immediately picked it up and listened to it. I was blown away from the first track on. My favorite track that really attracted me to buying the CD was Karma Police. If you think that song is good, you're on the right track, but you have to buy the whole album, it is that good. As i said in the title of the review, no word in the English language can describe this album. You cannot put it into a category and i think it is best to leave it that way. I would put this CD up there along the lines of Pink Floyd's Dark Side of The Moon as one of the best albums in a long time. Keep on making good albums Radiohead. Surprise us every time!
B00006RU5B|5.0|I was not really a huge fan of Soundgarden or Rage but I do own several of their albums. I think that Soundgarden could have gone on to record several more good albums. However, I think that Rage was pretty much a one-trick-pony. Their best offering was their first (I can't remember the title... was it Bombtrack?) Audioslave is a genious collaberation of some of the best rockers out there. The marraige of Cornell and the super kickA$$ dudes from Rage couldn't have been more perfect. I think that Morello and that other dude made a good move getting away from Zach DeLawhatever. I don't think that I could listen to any more of his wacked-out political rants. I can truly say that this is one of the best CDs that I have bought in a long time.
B00006F83Y|5.0|Josh Homme has to be the most creative man in hard  rock of the last 10 years. Maybe that's a too bold statement. But he was the mastermind of Kyuss in the early 90's when he was 19 years old! Creating that quality of music at such a young age you need amazing talent. Then he went on to form QOTSA all while doing his side project recording series: The Desert Sessions, now in version 9-10. In 2004 he took the drum seat for The Eagles of Death Metal, also another QOTSA release is expected.<br /><br />I am in no way a music theory expert but his guitar work just sounds amazing on this album. Every track is awesome and each one has its own different style. My personal favorite is Song For the Dead a perfect combination of trippy and heavy riffs alternating for verse-chorus.<br /><br />Mix Josh Homme's guitar work with Dave Grohl's amazing drumming and you are in for great quality straight-up rock album.<br />[I hope Dave reads this: everytime I hear this album I can't help myself but I start air-drumming, I wish I could learn this songs and play along, because the drum work is simply awesome.]<br /><br />I have to accept that watching the video for No One Knows was my introduction to this band and to Josh Homme's amazing career. I was too young when Kyuss was alive and I had never heard of earlier QOTSA releases like Rated R which I also recommend. This album opened the floodgates into the QOTSA / Kyuss family tree, I am thankful for that as I have found awesome music: Desert Sessions, Mondo Generator, Brant Bjork, to name a few.<br /><br />If you want a break from all the crappy rock and nu metal out there now get this amazing album. You won't be dissapointed.<br /><br />J
B00005JMFQ|3.0|Sweet movie of love, love and some more love. Many stars and quite a few side stories makes it interesting.
B0000214F0|1.0|I rented this movie once and couldn't finish it; it was too gory! Compared to some of the acts of torture in this movie, Abu Gharib was a walk in the park. There's also plenty of graphic nudity and sex, which can be a bit off-putting, especially when it higlights Emperor Caligula's somewhat outré tastes. Nowadays, he might be classified as a sexual predator and/or a serial rapist.<br />This film is not intended to be historically accurate (which is virtually impossible, anyway*), and lives up to its' billing as the first $15 million porno film ever. Watch it if you dare, but don't say I didn't warn you!<br />*There are very few accurate historical sources on the reign of Emperor Gaius (Caligula), A.D. 37-41. For more information, SEE: (...).
B000148KK2|2.0|Although I absolutely *loved* &quot;Temptation&quot; and &quot;Narrow Daylight,&quot; I found that these were the only two songs I could stomach on the entire CD.  Of course, I'm no jazz fan to say the least, so this might explain my choices for best songs.  I must say, though, that Diana Krall has a wonderful voice, much better suited to Blues, and it is my opinion that she shouldn't waste it on jazz (which has about as much appeal to me as rap).  But that's just me...
B00000DGSN|5.0|Deep Purple 'made in japan'<BR>Listening to this album back in the seventies was music to my ears. Great guitar playing with a hard core edge to the music. I found this album to be very innovated and adding the organ to rock music entered rock music into a new category, yet retained the true elements of what rock and roll was all about. <BR>I recently purchased 'Made in Japan' on C.D. and it was wonderful to hear the old classic sounding as fresh as ever, almost as if it were right off the press recordings. I haven't heard this album for quite awhile and sure brought back memories from the good ol days of ROCK AND ROLL MUSIC WHEN ROCK WAS ROCK. 'MAN THOSE CATS COULD REALLY SWING'and still can. It was just great to hear these old songs once again and what more can one say or ask for.<br />I recently purchased the 'Come Hell or High Water' D.V.D. and it too was a experience to see the guys celebrating 25 years of rock and rolling and then some. I also never got a chance to see Deep Purple in concert. Either they never toured in this part of the world during that time or they just never toured in Toronto, Canada, to my knowledge anyway. So I have an opportunity to see these great rockers doing there stuff here in Toronto, Canada ,August 21, 04. Unfortunately,Ritchie Blackmore and Jon Lord  (retired) won't be on this tour and I will miss their stage presence and hearing their special unique styles. However,three original members are in the present lineup and I am certain that the new members will bring a freshness to the old classics from the 'Machine Head' era.<br />Back to &quot;Made in Japan&quot;. I really enjoyed the music from this recording and to hear the individuals jamming during various numbers such as 'Child in Time' 'Lazy' etc. shows the bands ability to extend their songs and give the audience what they wanted. This band was loud and to get a live recording that seems almost flawless speaks volumes about the bands ability to give the fans a recording thatsounds close to perfection as one can get. I purchased another recording of another 70's band and I am not pleased with how much distortion and crowd noise there was especially for a band that prides itself on it's previous recordings. They simply could have done a better job. Why could they not took a page from the 'Made in Japan' album and give the fans something to truly remember them by. Anyway, we are blessed with the music of Deep Purple and their videos and recordings. Lets hope that Deep Purple will be rocking us for another few years with their terrific concerts and music.<BR>'Keep on Rocking' as there are not many good old rock and roll concerts left to go see. See ya all at the concert.
B00008PC2O|4.0|Hello, I currently own both Ultimate and Extreme editions. The main differences when comparing both films are already explained here in the amazon Editorial Review. One difference that is not talked about is the fact that the Extreme edition lacks the Special &quot;Extended&quot; Version option. The Ultimate edition has the theatrical version, the special edition version and the special edition extended version as options to choose from. The Extreme edition only has the special edition and the theatrical version options to choose from. The scenes when the T1000 scans the room with his hands and the alternate future ending are not implemented directy onto the film in the Extreme Edition(a feature of the special extended version from the Ultimate edition). That's my only complaint of the Extreme Edition, but when comparing both films, I believe that the Extreme edition is better than the Ultimate Edition due to it's superior scene quality as well as everything else mentioned in the editorial reviews.

0446678430|5.0|Robert Kiyosaki started with nothing and in less than ten years, retired financially free. He enjoys a lifestyle that we all wish we had. One of the first mindsets or mentality that he had to change was to succeed in a world without a paycheck. This is in a world that practically deifies a job and a paycheck.<br />Kiyosaki explains that most people have 50%-100% of their income is from earned income from a J-O-B. BIG MISTAKE! Those who retire young and retire rich do so from portfolio income. From passive income. From residual income.<br />How do you do this? You create a business. It can  be network marketing or a franchise (if you have that kind of money sitting around or the ability to borrow it) Or it could be real estate (my choice--no downlines, uplines, sidelines, monthly quota's, sales volume requirements etc.) Or you could write a book. Self publishing is flourishing today because many people have excellent ideas and eager to disseminate these ideas in the form of a book. <br />Retire Young Retire Rich is an excellent book for anyone who regardless of their present income or level of wealth, wants to retire financially free and financially independant within 10 years or less.<br />Great book. Maybe his best to date.
B00005JLXE|4.0|When I was a kid in the 60's I bought every issue I could of Daredevil, The Fantastic Four, and Doctor Strange. I kept up with Daredevil longer than I did with any other comic book. I kept reading his adventures until the early 80's and then we parted company. I had kids to raise and stopped reading comics and started working more. The ads for this movie brought back memories of my younger days with Daredevil. I also had mixed feelings and didn't want Hollywood to screw up my hero. I've now watched it on DVD. When the movie ended and the credits rolled I was left feeling pretty damn good. Daredevil was in good shape and it was nice to see him again. This movie did him justice. No complaints. It was a good show served up in the mighty Marvel manner.
0345350499|5.0|this story takes one from the 21st century way, way back in time. in the last days of the goddess and the  power of women, the Mists of Avalon is probably the most convincing story of the times Arthur and the Nights of the Round Table. it glorifys no one and simply tells the story. the Druids and Priestesses are intialy raised above the Christians, but in the end one sees that they are the same in the fight for power. what was a fight for the land and the goddess falls down in a story of human life. it shows how the dark ages became the dark ages.
B00000IQW0|5.0|Picked this DVD up a few days ago at Walmart and had forgotten how much fun this show and movie were. I agree with those who say you might want to save your dough and go with the bigger set with all the episodes though. I picked this one up for a lark and now I'm planning to get the whole series. I guess I can give this to a friend.
B00008S2VG|2.0|It's your average CD. The type of music you hear from every generic pop act these days. You don't think about the songs after hearing them. I always measure a great record by the impression the music leaves on me afterwards. If I suddenly catch myself singing it in my head where ever I am, or thinking about the lyrics and the meaning behind them, then I know the album is having an effect on me. Not in this case, however. It's just there.
630469797X|2.0|When i found out that there was a remake of George A Romero's classic , Dawn of the Dead being produced in America i was very excited about seeing it , because i am a number 1 fan of the whole concept of ''the dead walking the earth '' and giving us horror buffs a really meaty series of deaths to gag on .<BR>  The first time i ever saw DoD i knew ther would be no horror to ever match the intensity and the blackness of what the human world had found its self in after the dead had taken over.<BR>  I enjoyed the fact that allthough every live human was going to get it in the neck sooner or later, there was some balance, as the dead could not move as fast, and could not use tools, in effect,they were DEAD.<BR>  The 2004 version was always going to have the flash new special effects but the Production Crew did not even take advantage of that very creativley.<BR>  The Dead do not run. They are Dead.<BR>  The film spent too much time dealing with emotions and personal conflict.<BR>  There should have been more time devoted with edge of the seat drama of how the ''virus'' started spreading and of the killing of people who did not know what was going on.<BR>  The children in the bus scene was quite disturbing and if the film had given us more of this type of horror instead of the cat &amp; mouse senario then i would have been worthy of the title of DoD remake.<BR> The make up was quite good and there were some memorable moments but it fell flat.I had been looking forward to a remake for many years and have even contemplated writing a screenplay myself dealing with the post Day of the Dead world, Maby someday i will , but i was rather hoping sombody else would take up the challenge who is more qualified than me to produce a truly horrific movie in this genere that G.A Romero created.I'm just a dumb Screenprinter.<BR>  If the producers really want to redeem themselves they should finish the job and do a Day of the Dead remake style of movie with no running dead and truly horriffic death scenes , some hope for the human race and with an intelligent ending , any ideas?, i have many.If anyone would like a taste, e-mail me on       nzsp@xtra.co.nz
B0001NBMBC|5.0|This is exactly what I could have hoped for in Slipknot's latest album. There's still the heavy, f- the world songs, but Corey also pours out his emotions without screaming them in some. This CD has one bad word, which is in 'Duality.' (&quot;I've wished for this, I've b**ched at that) However, the only downfall to this album, which I didn't really mind, is that it's more like Stoneknot than Slipknot. Corey shows his real feelings without screaming, which &quot;is what Stone Sour is for.&quot; If you listen to the whole CD through you will know this is no Stone Sour. He does a lot more singing which takes away from the normal brutality of Slipknot, which is a good thing because Slipknot is very talented and do not normally get the chance to show it off. They show it in this CD very much. Corey's amazing voice in almost every song, Joey's amazing skill in &quot;Welcome&quot; and &quot;The Nameless,&quot; Mick and Jim's talent with sweep arpeggios in &quot;Opium of the People&quot; and crazy fast finger movements in &quot;The Nameless.&quot; This CD hardly has any 'DJing' in it, but it rocks all the same. <br />      &quot;Volume 3: The Subliminal Verses&quot; is my favorite Slipknot CD. However, I haven't heard &quot;Mate.Feed.Kill.Repeat.,&quot; but it is my favorite of the three later released. The barcode album was great but it only had a handful of good songs like &quot;(sic),&quot; &quot;Eyeless,&quot; &quot;Wait and Bleed,&quot; &quot;Surfacing,&quot; &quot;Me Inside,&quot; &quot;Liberate&quot; and &quot;No Life.&quot; I dislike &quot;Iowa&quot; because there is too much anger there and it makes for not as good songs. This CD delivers everything needed for a good album. Even with two acoustic, yes, acoustic, songs, &quot;Circle&quot; and &quot;Vermilion Pt. 2,&quot; &quot;Vol. 3: The Subliminal Verses,&quot; is an excellent album you should pick up even if you're not a Slipknot fan. This CD is a good heavy metal CD that should be in every collection.
B0001GOH6Q|1.0|And you thought Mars Attacks was bad? You ain't seen nothin' yet.<br />What a huge disappointment. It never, excuse the pun, reels you in. The best parts of the movie are the ones without Burton's playful imagery. Tim Burton's films are really starting to annoy me. They are so childish and lack any sort of real substance. They rely solely on the visual aspect, and that gets tiring after awhile. It's like if Tim Burton were a painter then his medium of choice would be crayon. Granted he can do some really good stuff in crayon, but step up and be a man for once. Put away your crayons, and try using some paint.
B0001MDP3G|1.0|This has to be the worst Civil War movie I've ever seen. The bad music and incessant slow-motion during the opening battle scene was downright silly.  Plus you can easily spot the prop department's rubber bayonets wobbling as the soldiers are running during the battle scenes. Even the dumbest person knows that bayonets are made of steel and shouldn't wobble.   Cold Mountain will probably be a career-ender for it's historical consultants... if there were any.    On top of the yahoo Yankees and cornpone Confederates, modern feminist propaganda literally drips from the screen to the point where there is even a faint whiff of lesbianism. And of course the white male is repeatedly stereotyped, from inauthentic southern accents to the vapid facial expressions. If this isn't bad enough certain scenes are downright degenerate and would be more suitable in a softcore porn film.

B00020HEL6|4.0|Have just listened to Renee Olstead's debut reprise recording and thought it first rate.  As a senior from a musical family I love listening to standards.  That this youngster can sing these songs so well is a stunning achievment!  Excellent arrangements back Olstead admirably and showcase this young woman's talent.  Liked everthing on the album, from the ballads to the swinging numbers.  Especially liked &quot;Someone to watch over me: and &quot;Midnight at th Oasis.&quot; I only hope that Renee will continue to mine the the standard catalog!

B000008JGJ|5.0|I own several versions of this (on LP & CD) but I believe this is my favorite. The packaging is unique, with a deluxe booklet containing lyrics, photos, and artwork; 5 very cool cards; and, a nice black box that houses it all. As far as the sound is concerned, there's always been different opinions among floydians regarding the various editions, but I would rank this at least the equal to any of the other versions. The 20th Anniversary Edition was lovingly remastered by engineer Doug Sax. Not many people are aware that the original release was several generations removed from the master tapes, according to David Gilmour, so this is a big improvement. One caution: if you buy this CD used, make sure the outer box is not beat up, if such things matter to you, as it tends to show wear very easily.

0790729369|3.0|\\"The Bridges of Madison County\\" is a stellar 1995 adaptation of a truly terrible book.  Director/star Clint Eastwood and screenwriter Richard LaGravanese are miracle workers in transforming Robert James Waller's treacly and laughable romantic potboiler into a classic romantic tearjerker about mature people falling in love over a four-day period and making some tough decisions that cost themselves happiness in order to make life better for those around them.  <br />\\"Bridges\\" stars the glorious Meryl Streep as Francesca Johnson, an Italian war bride turned unhappy '60's Iowa farm wife, who falls deeply into romantic love with National Geographic photographer Robert Kincaid (Eastwood) while her husband and teenage children are away for four days at an out-of-state fair.  She must then decide whether or not to abandon her family in order to spend the rest of her days with the love of her life.  The story is really as simple as that, as the true joy of this film is not in surprising and witty plot machinations but in watching two mature and interesting people TALK and RELATE to each other in a realistic manner, something you just don't see in American films any more.<BR>Add to the main plot a much-maligned framing device, set in the present-day with Annie Corley and Victor Slezak as Francesca's grown children.  (They're going through their recently-deceased mother's papers and find her diary which contains their mother's story of the affair.)  It adds an extra dimension as the pair are forced to confront the problems in their own marriages by reflecting on their mother's infidelity and sacrifice.  While some viewers evidently find the present-day story to be an unnecessary conceit, I feel it works just fine and leads to a final shot which is hauntingly memorable.<br />Actually, everything in this film is hauntingly memorable, from the amazing Streep's Oscar-nominated performance and Eastwood's nuanced and vanity-free work as Kincaid (Witness the nasty, ageist, and unnecessary comments about Eastwood's nude scenes in some of the previous comments and you'll know what I mean about \\"vanity-free\\"), to Corley's wonderful work as the daughter and Jim Haynie's nearly silent, though equally memorable turn as Francesca's dull, taciturn but unfailingly decent lump of a husband.  Only Slezak overplays his hand as Francesca's son, making him overbearing, unlikeable and unsympathetic.<br />The film is beautifully shot and stunningly edited by Eastwood regulars Jack N. Green and Joel Cox, making the Iowa landscape and the title bridges vital characters in the film.  In fact, Eastwood and company create an indelible sense of time and place; after viewing this film you may actually feel you've been transported to 1960's Winterset, Iowa.  Even Lennie Niehaus' obligatory jazz score works incredibly well, even though I would bet jazz wasn't exactly a radio stalwart in the midwest at that particular time.  In fact, it's a testament to how good the film is that an interlude at a black jazz nightclub doesn't come across as implausible until later, when you may wonder where exactly in Iowa such a place would exist.<br />My only disappointment with \\"The Bridges of Madison County\\" was that it faired so poorly during awards season. Eastwood, LaGravanese, Green and the film all deserved Oscar nominations, but when the nominations came, only Streep received one.  This in spite of the fact that 1995 was a weak year for Hollywood films, with two authentic classics (\\"Apollo 13\\" and \\"Babe\\") duking in out with three incredibly overrated pictures (Mel Gibson's eventual Oscar winner \\"Braveheart,\\" \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" and the already forgotten Italian treacle \\"Il Postino\\").  LaGravanese in particular was shamelessly snubbed for Adapted Screenplay, since his adaption was a substantial improvement over the source material while eventual winner Emma Thompson's \\"Sense...\\" script added little to Jane Austen's masterpiece.  My guess is Waller's original novel was so horrible that the Academy didn't want to be associated with it in spite of the masterful work that went into this adaptation.  Oh, well--<br />So, considering this glowing review, you may wonder why it only ranks a *** rating?  Simple.  I'm rating the DVD, and it is a true disappointment:  the only Eastwood directorial effort not available in a widescreen transfer, which is puzzling considering Warner Home Video has released all other titles in its Eastwood catalog exclusively in widescreen.  My guess is they're waiting for next year's tenth anniversary to release a special edition with making-of features, interviews and widescreen presentation.  One can only hope.  Until then, this print will have to do.  So enjoy, and grab a hanky.  You'll need it.
B00008H2LB|1.0|For those of you who haven't heard Linkin Park, they are a rock/rap group. I like rap and rock, but I hate hearing Linkin Park sing rock, because they can't sing or play guitar worth a crap. It's pathetic when they try to rap, because they also suck at that. I read a review by this retard who goes by &quot;g&quot;. His review is titled something like &quot;Hataz need to stop hatin&quot;. And then he claims that bands are Slayer are commerical. As opposed to Linkin Park? Linkin Park is one of the most commerical bands out there. Linkin Park should NOT mix rap with rock the way they do. They need to kill themselves. As for &quot;g&quot;, u need 2 uz kurekt inglish yo. Seriously, quit being so damn ignorant. Go back to school, pass English, and quit listening to that Linkin Park and Avril Lavigne crap. Oh, what's that, &quot;g&quot;, you're gonna bust a cap in my hatin' ass? You'll have to find me first.
B00005JLD4|5.0|I was aware that the treatment of the Aborigines by those that settled Australia was fairly consistent with that of all European settlers dealing with indigenous people when &quot;colonizing&quot; someone else's land.  I specifically recall how during the 2000 Sydney Olympics much was made of the symbolism of Cathy Freeman, an Aborigine on the Australian Olympic team, lighting the Olympic torch.  Even more was made of the symbolism when Freeman went on to win the gold medal in the 400 meter.  But I have to admit that when it comes to Australian films I tend to think in terms of &quot;Breaker Morant&quot; and &quot;Gallipoli,&quot; where the point was how the British Empire was treating the Australian citizens of the Commonwealth as if nothing had changed since the first convicts were sent from Britain Down Under.  Still, to see Australians turn around and treat others even more inhumanely was rather something of a shock.<br />&quot;Rabbit-Proof Fence&quot; is the story of three young Aborigine girls who escaped from a government camp in 1931 and tried to walk home 1,500 miles.  Molly (Everlyn Sampi), her sister Daisy (Tianna Sansbury) and cousin Gracie (Laura Monaghan) were taken from their mothers because they are half-castes, their white fathers long gone after constructing the rabbit-proof fence which saves Australia's farm land from being devoured.  The fence, of course, is both a metaphor for the separation of the children from their families as well as the touchstone that can help the girls get home.<br />The reason the girls are removed is because of the edict of A.O. Neville (Kenneth Branagh), who was the administrator in charge of Aborigines in Western Australia.  As portrayed in the film Neville is concerned about the creation of a third race and has the idea that with the proper breeding within three generations the half-castes will look white.  Now there is conflicting historical evidence on how Aborigine children ended up at the Moore River Native Settlement pertaining to half-castes being ostracized by pure bloods and Aborigine parents wanted their children to receive an education.  But in &quot;Rabbit-Proof Fence&quot; the reasons are clearly to &quot;save&quot; these children from themselves, and there is an implication the education is so these children can be domestic servants for white families.<br />Even if you did not see Branagh in &quot;Conspiracy,&quot; the TV movie where he played SS-Obergruppenf&uuml;hrer Reinhard Heydrich, Chief of the Reich Main Security Office, and chief architect of the &quot;Final Solution&quot; at the Wannsee Conference the parallels are unmistakable between Neville's theory of eugenics and the Nazis.  But once Molly leads the other two girls into the outback Neville is not as important to the chase as Modoo (David Gulpilil), the native tracker who is required to enforce the policies that are resulting in &quot;The Lost Generation&quot; of his people.  If this is a film that wants to see the world only in terms of black or white, there is no doubt which side wins your sympathy.<br />Having made big budget Hollywood films like &quot;Patriot Games,&quot; &quot;Clear and Present Danger&quot; and &quot;The Bone Collector,&quot; director Phillip Noyes provides a more intimate film like he did back in 1977 with &quot;Backroads.&quot;  His three stars are a trio of first time actresses, selected (as he explains in the accompanying featurette) so that everybody in the world who say them would want to adopt them.  But they also turn out to act and Sampi as Molly Craig is at least as good as Keisha Castle-Hughes was in &quot;Whale Rider.&quot;<br />This is a true story and as such you know not to expect a happy ending, but that does not stop your from harboring such hopes as the three girls continue on their journey and the authorities try to stop them before they reach their home and their families.  As a true story there will be the obligatory title cards at the end telling you the restof the story and explaining how the practice of separating half-castes from their parents continued until 1970, which may well be a more depressing thought than anything engendered by the film.  But be forewarned that the most devastating scene on the DVD is not in the film when the girls are taken away from their wailing mothers, but in the featurette when we see what happens to the cast and crew after they finish filming that scene.<br />Special note needs to be made of the commentary track provided by director Phillip Noyce and featuring musician Peter Gabriel, actor Kenneth Branagh, screenwriter Chiristine Olsen and author Pilkington Garimara.  This is not a track where everybody is in the room at once talking about the film.  Instead this is mostly Noyce talking about the film, totally independent of what is on the screen, and when he talks about one of the other principles we get to hear their thoughts on the process of turning the original book and the story it was based on into this film.  This is usually the sort of deep thoughts you get from a film critic doing the commentary on a Criterion Edition of a classic film, so finding it on this 2002 drama is a nice bonus.t of the story and explaining how the practice of separating half-castes from their parents continued until 1970, which may well be a more depressing thought than anything engendered by the film.

B00006JU7T|5.0|I've always said in my personal meetings with coleagues and friends that Pacino is much more than an actor ; he's a nature force .<br />But back to Serpico. This movie not only remains as cult movie and one of the most`powerful works of this tireless film maker as Sidney Lumet was in that age. Serpico meant a breakthrough with the ancient patterns of good citizen and virtuosi cop.<br />Serpico is a simple inmigrant citizen who lives in a little department ; he brings in his mind the ancestral illusions for being part of the american dream . His inner sense of justice is not influenced for any other kind of ideology . In this sense he's naif ; suddenly he's inmersed in a double face world; the eternal game of make the things appear right ; though they are rotten really .<br />His search for the sense of justice prevails and becomes nowadays, in a kind of romantic knight ; but he , besides the prize he must pay for his behavior , goes ahead no matter what. Don't forget that in times of hipocrisy ; any sincerity is associated with cynism.<br />This film is part of the amazing sextet together with Twelve angry men, The pawnbroker , The offence ,  Network and Equus ; that in my opinion express the most remarkable works of that extraordinary film maker.
0060012218|4.0|A few years ago when I went to vote at my old high school, The GSA (Gay-Straight Alliance) was holding a bake sale outside the polling area. \\"Times have changed\\" was my immediate thought, knowing that when I attended school there, a GSA would never have even dared to exist. The fact that a book such as GEOGRAPHY CLUB could be published and not be all that controversial, at least in this neck of the woods, confirms that times have changed.<br />It is a first person narrative about a high school student named Kevin who knows he is gay. While he is not celebrating his sexual preference, he is not loathing it either. He discovers there are other gay students in his school and they devise a way to meet: by forming a club no one will want to join, a geography club (hence the title). There are many ups and downs for the people involved, and lessons to be learned, but sharing them would probably ruin the story.<br />Reviewers in print have both praised and panned the book, as have reviewers on Amazon.com. The book is an easy and enjoyable read though it will probably not stand the test of time as an all time classic for young people, but it does serve an important purpose. As I wondered what merits the book has, my first thought turned to gay readers. Will gay readers find characters they can identify with in this book? Perhaps. Since the characters are likeable but flawed, this is a possibility, but it could also be viewed as a bit superficial. Yet as I thought more about it, I realized that the book does make a significant contribution to adolescent literature. Readers are used to gay characters who are self depreciating outcasts who are the constant targets of bullies. None are members of the drama club either (though one does love Disney musicals). The gay characters in GEOGRAPHY CLUB are not stereotypes, they are typical high schools students who want the same thing that straight high school students want and if this book can help people see this wile providing an enjoyable read, it has more than accomplished something important as we strive toward understanding in today's world.yable read, it has more than accomplished something important as we strive toward understanding in today's world.
0425129616|5.0|I've always preferred Agatha Christie's early mysteries to those published late in her life.  Somehow the most recent works feel cranked out rather than thought out.<br />&quot;Styles&quot; reeks with atmosphere, and the characters, stock though they may be, are quite good.  The English country house, locked room murder tale has been overdone a bit (I eschew hyperbole), but it seems fresh-born here.  Perhaps it is because this is the author's first-born mystery novel and she cared about what she was doing.<br />Other reviewers have described the actual plot, so I will not repeat that.  Suffice it to say that the plot works, and the surprises are indeed unexpected.  The logic and denouement are fair to the reader.  The plot doesn't have to be perfect.  It just has to...&quot;work,&quot; for lack of a better verb.  Mystery readers, often without knowing it, read this genre not for the ingenious plot but for the feel of place and for the characters.  If feel and characters are your thing, you can't go wrong with this one.
B000002KMY|4.0|1st of all like someone already said, how do you replace Ozzy Osbourne? Well luckily Dio is a legend, he's been around forever. I was never nuts about the Elf stuff, but I did like his Rainbow material. I thought this release was a breath of fresh air, the last sabbath release &quot;never say die&quot; was weak. It had 2 good songs maybe, never say die &amp; johnny blade. <BR>The 1st half of The Mob Rules is great, all fast past heavy songs, the next half imo is all filler material. Turn up the night, voodoo, sign of the southern cross, &amp; E5150 are instant classics. <BR>No one has mentioned the cover of this cd, look at the bloody cloth closely....it's a demoms face. Cool huh???? One last thing why are people saying E5150 is way out of character for sabbath?? It's not, Ever heard the song &quot;Who are you&quot;?? Check it out.
B000001Y5J|5.0|Ah, what fond memories. Quite a few years ago, of friend of mine payed me this CD. The first NIN song I ever heard was &quot;Wish&quot;, and it stunned me. I quickly traded him a few undesirable discs for this one, and I immediately fell in love with it. I came from a heavy metal background, so the agressiveness instantly appealed to me, but the atmospheric touches and production nuances were well beyond my music in scope. &quot;Wish&quot; is still one of my favorite songs ever. The brtual &quot;Last&quot; satisfys my inner metalhead, while the dark instrumental &quot;Help Me I Am In Hell&quot; appreciates my ear for music. The coal-black techno-metal&quot;Happiness In Slavery&quot;, the synth hard rock of &quot;Gave Up&quot;, and the danceable headbanger &quot;Suck&quot; are some of the best music Trent's genius mind has unleashed. Although a lot of people don't conside Broken an album, it's one of the most phenomenal works in the NIN canon and possibly Trent Reznor's best achievement. An don't forget the mystery of the Broken movie...
B0001L3LUE|5.0|Unfortunately I had only the opportunity to view this film once thus far -- at the theatre.   Robert MacNamara, now in his upper 80s, provides eleven lessons he has learned about war.   <br />The Cuban Missle Crises:  Years afterward, MacNamara was in Cuba visiting and met with Fidel Castro.  Castro told him that he was recommending to the Soviet leadership to nuke the United States, even though Castro acknowledged that would mean the obliteration of his own county, Cuba -- and nuclear war on a vaster basis, thus we came that close to total nuclear war.  As a child of ten at the time, I had no inkling how serious the situation was besides the nuclear attack exercises that we did in school -- like going under one's desk was going to improve the survival rate several miles from MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa.  <br />The lessons are worth viewing again -- and especially worthwhile for the current administration, which clearly hasn't learned these lessons regarding war.

B00008NRI8|4.0|I'm shocked by the reviews I'm reading of this film!  I must say, anyone who's ever been in love with someone, particularly if that person is your best friend, in addition to being your worst enemy, this film will SPEAK to you.<br />I won't lie that this film falls victim to the formulaic conventions of most romatic-comedies, but the screenwriter presents the characters in such a way that you forgive it all.  Both of the primary characters are entirely sympathetic in all aspects, even the rich, handsome, bastardly Grant.<br />At the end, you adore Bullock for much the reason Grant does.  Despite her nerosies and non-sense, her heart is in the right place.  And while Grant's character is less-sympathetic, you truly regard him as an unwitting villian... one by way of creation, rather than one by way of nature.<br />Ultimately, it's a story for adults and an adult love... the sort that smacks you in the face, just when you think that you're too old to fall victim to emotion versus rationale.  The scene where they pick through one another's lunches speaks volumes to any person who's ever loved someone they hated.  How could you love someone who loves beets?  Maybe because they love beets when you don't.<br />I recommend this film highly for anyone looking for a good laugh and sporadic cry on a Friday night.  Overall, lovely, brilliant performances... and a script worth lauding, if for nothing else, because it makes such frustrating characters so entirely human.

I'm so in awe of her that sometimes I can't get past the fact that it's Lea Salonga performing there and not the character, no matter how consistently great her delivery of any role is.  But that's MY problem as a viewer, not hers, because she's so brilliant in her work that people have come to adore her and come to her shows to see HER and not the character.

Well, now that we have unpacked all the boxes from our move to take this job - I find we have about 5 copies of this book.  This book is GREAT!  This is not a new book but has been read by millions of people and is now a classic.  The first edition came out in 1981 and the second edition 10 years later.  The newest edition benefits from many updates and has an additional chapter (#10) with common questions (and answers) that people have commonly asked about Getting to Yes. This new chapter really helps the reader to understand the method better - in fact I can't imagine the book without it. One of the best things that authors Fisher, Ury and Patton do in this popular book do is give the reader a practical framework for developing better relationships that lead to better outcomes in life and work.  The ideas are helpful in getting along with family as well as in the workplace.  In many cases their methods will sound like things you already knew and have practiced in some of the more successful moments in your life.  However, the book puts it all in perspective and gives you the complete picture to know why it works better when you focus on helping the other person get what they want so you can, too.  After reading Getting to Yes you will be more prepared to negotiate more effectively in every type of situation.  This book helped me decide I like the new boss, too!
B000089RVX|5.0|Do not listen to people who give bad reviews, get the cd, and make up your own mind. I've had this cd since the day it came out. I can honestly say that I have never purchased a better cd in all my life. If I could buy it, and listen to it for the first time again, I would do it a thousands times over. Never has a band captured my attention like Evanescence, and never have I been happier with the music. <BR>    Amy Lee, the face of the band, is one of the best singers in music today, and she displays her talents magnificently. From the harder songs like &quot;Going Under&quot; and &quot;Haunted&quot;, to the beautifully serene &quot;My Immortal&quot; and &quot;Hello&quot; her acrobatic vocals show a wide range and a strengh unseen in rock music for some time. Her lyrics are a personal journey through the ups and downs in life, including the loss of her sister at a young age (Hello). For people who say it's unbearably gothic, and trying to hard to be depressed, forget the actual words, and just listen. Don't try so hard to find the meaning, and the meaning will come to you. <BR>   Guitarist Ben Moody Also displays his songwriting abilities in the aforementioned My Immortal and Haunted. Not too bad for a guitar player. Both songs, while sonically so very different, are equally spectacular. He also takes the spotlight musically in numerous places on the cd. His guitar solo's in Haunted and Going Under, his riffs in Tourniquet and Whisper, and his off beat rythm in Bring Me To Life are just a few where he displays a little more than just a knowledge of the fretboard. <BR>   One of the things that make this cd so breathtaking is the choir and string arrangements. Interludes between songs create a wonderful transition and heighten the listening experience. The strings actually involved in the song add a lovely touch, and make it all the more effective. <BR>    The most that I can do is recommend this cd with all of my recommending ability. If you are anything like me at all, you will instantly fall in love with this cd. The least you can do is give it chance. Make up your own mind, and you won't regret it.
B0001ZX0PG|1.0|The only good thing about this film is that it brought to light (again) that the Academy Awards are a total Farce (I'm looking at you Training Day).  This was a cheesy detective novel with a &quot;dark&quot; ending (I use the quotes to show that I think that dark is overused and unapplicable to this film).  I love all the actors in it, and I love Eastwood as a director, but this was an absolute failure.  The ending made absolutely no sense.  The whole movie is about the men, then in the end they focus on thier wives.  Is that to make it dramatic or artistic?  If so you failed.  I cannot remember the last time I was more disappointed in a film, and I saw Waterworld.<BR>   The Savage brothers were so over the top that they seemed like they came out of some sort of crappy comic book.  They just make everything look rediculous.  Plus, they do everything obviously to point towards one character, then they magically have an explanation of what happened to make him look like the killer.  This would have been fine and dandy had a great director and even greater actors (sorry Kevin you do not qualify although I loved you in Footloose, and Quicksilver) not been in play.  It is obvious that the Academy just picks what actors they want to have awards and does not even watch the films.  Do not waste your time watching this movie.
B00004Y6O9|5.0|What can one say about this stunning debut from the greatest band of all time? To say it revolutionalized the rock scene is an understatment. &quot;Eruption&quot;, while not as magical a listen as it was when it first came out, is still one of the best solo's ever recorded. Introducing the two-handed technique, displaying a masterful knowledge of the fretboard, blinding speed, and whammy bar acrobatics all wrapped up into a 2 minute masterpiece of musical brilliance, Eddie Van Halen solidified his spot in the pantheon of guitar gods, and this is just the second cut. Their cover of the Kinks &quot;You Really Got Me&quot; could be one of the best covers ever produced. Burning fretwork also shows up in the solo to 'Ice Cream Man' and the closing track 'On Fire'. After listening to these, you would think that he was all go, all the time, but what Eddie is truly underappreciated for is his ability to lay back and and play rythm. The rythm to 'Atomic Punk' and 'Little Dreamer' show how tight the band is as a unit. Bass player Michael Anthony and drummer Alex Van Halen lay as solid a foundation as you can get, and Eddie has an amazing ability to let the song breath. Vocally, David Lee Roth never sang better than he did on this cd. His playful singing style really complements the guitar, and his lyrics are great for whatever the mood of the song is. Another one of the most overlooked aspects of the Vna Halen sound is the backup vocals of Michale Anthony and Eddie. Eddie's low voice, and Mikes amazingly powerful highs created a three octave sound when added to Roth's. This gave even there heaviest songs an approachable feel to the unknown listener. not so much pop, but enough to catch the ear. Great hooks.<BR>A must have for any fan of music.
B000002IHU|5.0|You could take this album, Dokken's Under Lock and Key, and Crue's Theatre of Pain, and you would have the best three albums of this time period and the L.A. scene of the mid 80's. Like, Under Lock and Key, the production is terrific. Everyone knows You're in Love and Lay It Down, but every song on this album is good. You just don't find that anymore. I think this is why I like this studio effort better than Out of the Cellar because there is no filler. At some point when they were writing and recording for this album, they just got into a zone. A lot of these songs sound like they could flow right into the other without a break because they are similar in movement and tempo. Never Use Love, Dangerous But Worth the Risk, What You Give is What You Get, and You Should Know By Now are all classics. If you don't own this one, you need to do something about it. This one also makes my top 10 80's hard rock list. One other cd I would recommend that came out around the same time that wasn't from the L.A. scene is The Ultimate Sin by Ozzy.
B000002J1U|5.0|I have all of Led Zeppelin's studio recordings and each has been my favorite at some time or another. Even though it is critized by many and often regarded as one of Zeppelin's weaker albums, Led Zeppelin III to me is actually one of there strongest. These negative reviews come mainly because of the bands accoustic leanings at the time, but that is really not a bad thing, since the albums still has it's fair share of rockers, and some of their best rockers ever, like &quot;The Immigrant Song&quot; and &quot;Out On The Tiles&quot;. And not to mention, this album contains one of the best and most powerful tracks ever recorded in &quot;Since I've Been Loving You&quot;. This is the true gem on this album. Never has Robert Plant sang with such passion as he did on this track. In fact, it is this album in which I feel Plant shines the most. His voice is in peak performance, and really adds depth to the songs, especially the more accoustic ones. Listen to &quot;Tangerine&quot; for example, and I think you will see what I mean. Overall, this album is essential in any music collection, and is a really enjoyable listen. It rocks out on tracks like &quot;Celebration Day&quot;, &quot;The Immigrant Song&quot;, and &quot;Out on the Tiles&quot;. It has accoustic brilliance on tracks like &quot;Gallows Pole&quot;, &quot;Tangerine&quot;, and &quot;That's the Way&quot;. Truly a Zeppelin masterpiece and a must have for any classic rock fan.
B000002H3E|5.0|This is one of the best hard rock albums of the 1980's...period. Cover to cover this is Dokken's best album. Unchain the Night starts it out and it never lets up. In My Dreams and It's Not Love will always be classics. The Hunter and Jaded Heart are mid tempo gems, the latter of which is a haunting ballad. Even the couple of slow moments on this album come with such a kick!The production on this album is phenominal. No collection is complete without this one. Definitely in my top 10 hard rock albums ever.
B00000269G|5.0|.....as a little girl in Palo Alto, California probably around 1969 I listened to my father (who is a jazz pianist in his own right) play this record numerous times.  It stood out because usually I heard him playing his Bluthner grand piano in his inimitable way and style . . . very influenced by Garner but also his own style.....but then on a regular basis I heard this album.  Again and again.  It was years later that I realised that although I loved Erroll Garner and had many of his CDs and even his record albums, it was years later that I realized THE recording that was &quot;the one&quot; I remembered -- the one that brings tears to my eyes without seemingly a reason -- it was THIS recording - Concert By The Sea -- I read the editorial review with a smile where they said the &quot;sound is atrocious and the piano out of tune&quot;.......well ......no it's not.  Not really.  It's the sound of &quot;that night&quot; in &quot;that place&quot; and it's Erroll Garner all the way and I give it 5 stars!!!!!!  I received my copy today after several months of shamelessly listening to the free samples of the music....(budget is a bit tight these days)... all I can say in closing is this is THE definitive Garner recording!!
B00005NP04|4.0|A nice cd, a little less into martina then I used to be, but non the less she has a very good voice, and has had some excellent songs over the years.  Her new songs are also good especially \\"where would you be\\".  I like listening to \\"independence day\\", loves the only house\\", \\"wild angels\\".  A very good example of a well thought out greatest hits package, everything and more is on here.  My only complaint was that she skipped her first album.  I have been listening to her since she began, and I would have loved if \\"that's me\\" and \\"cheap whiskey\\" had been on here from her first album \\"the time has come\\".  19 tracks are definetely enough though, i probably would have taken out \\"there you are\\" and maybe \\"wrong again\\" and replaced with the two tracks I listed. But as far as greatest hits packates go, this is one of the best.  It's refreshing to see this when I see the very poor \\"greatest hits\\" faith hill has released. **** out of ***** stars
B00005JMCW|4.0|Freaky Friday is a remake of the original Disney flick that starred Jodie Foster in the role now played by Lindsay Lohan.  This is a warm-hearted comedy updated for the year 2003.  Upon switching bodies mother and daughter are forced to appreciate each other's point of view and to selflessly help one another make it through the hectic day created by the spell of the Chinese fortune cookie.  Lohan and Jamie Lee Curtis are charismatic in their roles, and the supporting cast, including Mark Harmon as step-dad to be all fill their roles smoothly.  This movie is engaging for all ages and delivers what you expect from this remake of a fine classic.
B00004TX5F|5.0|Director Gerard Corbiau's Farinelli won Best Picture of 1995. The foreign film, mixed Italian and French, retells the story of the famous and greatest castrato singer Carlo Broschi. The film is exotic, intensely emotional and loaded with beautiful music of the Baroque Era (1600-1750). With all the good things about this movie, comes some things that might be rather disturbing or inappropriate for a younger audience. This is assuredly an adult film. There are two explicit sex scenes at the beginning and end of the film. This is a movie for an adult who is interested in the period, in the life of the castrati and in opera at this time. The opening introduces Carlo Broschi as a little boy singing in the church choir. Another young lad has been castrated to preserve his voice and is so mortified he leaps to his death. Eventually Carlo's brother Riccardo is obligated to do the same to his brother. We don't learn until later in the film that it was Riccardo and not Carlos' brother that conducted the castration. Here, Farinelli is usually quite ill and is forced to take opium as medicine. Farinelli does not seem to think highly of his brother's operas, which are written exclusively for his voice. Instead, he believes the greatest composer of this time is George Frederic Handel, played convincingly by Jerome Krabbe. In a dinner party, in which the Nobles insult Handel, Farinelli is outraged and declares that Handel will long be remembered and not the Nobles and their operas. This ends up being true since Handel is considered one of the greatest composers of this period togeter with Johann Sebastian Bach.<br />The movie has some inaccuracies and are not historically true. Naturally, this being a costume drama, there are some elements which were entirely fictional created for the sake of sensationalism. Although it is true Riccardo Broschi did compose operas for his brother Farinelli, there is no real evidence they \\"shared\\" the women they bedded. In the movie, a Countess is so enamored with Farinelli that she jumps into bed with him only to discover he's castrated. Thus, Riccardo plants the seed and Farinelli only lures the women into bed and seduces them. This is fabricated material to \\"sex up\\" the movie. In real life, Farinelli I'm inclined to believe was chaste. He sung many times for religious services and was a devout Catholic. He may not have been at all bitter for his castration since he lived like a king all his life, surrounded in luxury. He was well acquainted with European royalty, all of Europe loved him and he died after years of singing in the chambers of King Phillip of Spain. The rivalry between the Nobles Theatre Opera and Handel's opera company is true. In fact, it remains the only true thing about this movie. The English in London disliked the German foreigner Handel and his prominence in London. He was so beloved that even King George and Queen Anne protected him. The Nobles schemed endlessly to get rid of Handel. The portrayal of Handel as a musical genius, a man of stubborn, perfectionist character is all true. I think the most moving scenes are those with Handel, such as the scene in which Farinelli is overhearing him play the organ in the church and is moved by the music and the scene of Farinelli singing \\"Lascio Chio Pianga\\" from Rinaldo which ultimately moves Handel to tears. All the scenes of opera and Farinelli singing in his majestic costumes in this movie are stunningly beautiful. Finally, this movie's soundtrack is incredible. It contains the combined voices of tenor Derek Rogin and soprano Ewa Mallas as the singing voice of Farinelli. The arias sung here are taken from Riccardo Broschi's operas Idaspe and Artaserse and from Handel's Julius Caesar and Rinaldo. A superb film and a must see for fans of Baroque opera.
B00005JKNB|3.0|Some guy loses his memory and a town thinks he is someone else. I still haven't finished this boring movie. They fix up a broken down movie house. I am half way thru. Maybe I will finish it someday.
B000003C2U|5.0|Ok, this is my first Death cd and the first thing I noticed was the extreme speed of the guitars, which are quite fantastic. I'm sure you all know that Chuck Shuldiner is dead, but for those who didn't he is. Let me say that he is one of the greatest Metal songwriters EVER. Every song on this cd is lightening fast brutality mixed in with some melodic leads and crazy melodic solos. The lyrics are wonderful and Chuck's vocals are very original and emotionally brutal. The bass is played majestically and is VERY deep, making the songs pretty heavy, combined with de-tuned guitars. It's that awesome-type of heavy, not the type where you de-tune your guitars so they  sound like mud (Mortician), but the type where the bass makes the music thick and heavy. Steve DiGorgio is a fantastic bassist, he really is.<BR>The guitars by Chuck and Co. are seriously fast, heavy and technical, at times, melodic.<BR>The drumming is fantastic, Sean Reinert is one of the best drummers in metal, he's on the level as Flo Mournier and Tony Leaurano (Cryptopsy, Nile), also some of the greatest drummers ever. His double bass is amazing!<br />Every song is awesome on this cd but my current favourites are Suicide Machine, Secret Face, Lack of Comprehension and Vacant Planets. This is a true classic and one of the greatest Death Metal cd ever.
B00003CXCT|1.0|When I was a little kid I loved Twinkies, GI Joes, Leggos, and Star Wars figures.  I'm glad that my adult life isn't so sorely lacking in meaning that I still cling to these children's movies.  The one star is for my kid, who might like them if he sees them before his tenth birthday.
B000062YAZ|5.0|Previously in a review for Seasons in the Abyss, I proclaimed that it was better than Reign in Blood. Boy, I am so wrong. Every time I listen to one or the other, I change my decision as to which one is better....I just have to make a final decision and this came out on top and after hours of analysing, Reign in Blood is faster, Seasons in the Abyss is more technical, the production is better on Seasons...., the songs are JUST better on Reign... than on Seasons....<br />Words cannot express how good this album actually is, I mean, I listen to this almost every day and I've had this cd for years! It really is that good... a tad overrated though... The greatest Thrash record? Yes! The greatest metal record? ...no.... As for what's what on this album, EVERY song kicks major a$$, my favourite is ANGEL OF DEATH, the greatest Slayer song ever, one of my top 10 picks for the greatest songs ever, easily, possibly the greatest. My other favourites are Piece by Piece, Jesus Saves, Necrophobic and Raining Blood.<br />Truly one of the greatest metal cds ever, never to be DISRESPECTED.... yeah, I'm talking to you Frank...<BR>1. Slayer is NOT slow, they are one of the fastest bands ever.<BR>2. NONE of the songs are ballads.<BR>3. They are WAY heavier than Nirvana.<br />This guy has to be the biggest fool on the planet...<BR>LOOK AT THE IDIOTS REVIEW OF ST.ANGER!!!!<br /> the best metallica cd ever June 28, 2004 <BR>this cd has to be the best of ALL TIME<BR>Killer guitar solos, 3 instrumental(one of them is a bass solo by lars ulrich), great singing by kirk hamlet. the best LYRICS by cliff burton. god man why couldnt metallica start off this good? back in the 70s they sucked, master of purple and ride the lighting sucked. this cd has awesome drumming by james mustaine. metallica's first good cd, metallica has stopped being such a crappy band. This looks like the start of a new wave of GREAT METAL <br />For a start, it's one of the WORST cds of all time, (Simple Plan included!) ithas NO solos, none of the songs are instrumentals, Lars Ulrich doesn't play bass, Kirk 'Hamlet's real name is Kirk HAMMET and he don't sing, he plays LEAD GUITAR FOOL! Cliff Burton is dead (R.I.P) and had he been alive, Metallica never would have ended up so bad. He never wrote the lyrics anyway!<BR>Metallica didn't start off 'this good' they started out BETTER! They started in the 80's, not the 70's, the cds are Master of Puppets and Ride the Lightening, James HETFIELD doesn't play the drums and Dave Mustaine plays in another band! I'm not gonna bother about the rest...<br />Hope you don't mind my little outburst, I just want you to get the message that 'Frank' is stupid (click on his not-helpful button!) and that.....SLAYER RULES!!!!!!!<br />Really, if you don't care about Metallica, forget what I wrote before, but if you do... I'm sure there's already steam coming out your ears already...
B0000029GA|5.0|this is what hip-hop is all about. it aint the fake mainstream stuff thats all over the radio, but its what any real hip-hop fan loves about the music. The songs are raw and true, and they each have real messages, not like the fake crap thats keeps people distracted from true issues. Nas is among the illest MC's ever to pick up the mic and let the truth flow.
B0002BO0AS|5.0|&quot;Whoa.&quot;  That was my reaction when I first heard Unearth's new CD, &quot;The Oncoming Storm&quot;.  Words cannot express just how amazing this CD is.  Now, I had huge expectations for this album:  I was expecting it to be the best CD to come out this year and to be completely perfect.  Even with those expectations, I was still blown away when I heard it.  Top to bottom, this album simply amazes me and is my pick for Album of the Year so far.<br />The first thing you will notice when you first pop this in is that Unearth has decided to favor more of the metal sound on this album and focus less on hardcore.  However, they still have some of the most punishing breakdowns you will ever hear.  There is a great Swedish metal influence on this record, especially on &quot;Zombie Autopilot&quot;, which sounds a lot like In Flames.<br />The guitar work on this album is just absolutely mind-blowing, it gets very complex.  This is their first CD with new drummer Mike Justain, and he provides drum fills galore throughout every song.  One thing I love about Unearth is that they never take the easy way out.  It would be very easy to just throw a record together and use the same formula and make it so that everyone can play their songs along with them.  But, they use their talent to the fullest and play what sounds good rather than what is easy to play.  Everything here has been given the time to be perfected, this is not some nu-metal record that was written in 20 minutes.  Each song on this CD is different and special in its own way.  A few ways that separate each song would be a catchy guitar part, a pummeling breakdown, or a guitar solo.<br />From the opening song, &quot;The Great Dividers&quot;, to the closing song, &quot;False Idols&quot;, this album is a miracle.  It is so amazing, it will bring you to tears when it is over.  But then again, you can always go back and listen to it again, which I strongly recommend you do.  Everyone into the metal/hardcore scene better get &quot;The Oncoming Storm&quot;.  If you don't get it, you will regret it.<br />Standout Tracks: The Great Dividers, Failure, Bloodlust of the Human Condition, Predetermined Sky

6305313687|5.0|I absolutley loved this movie and was very moved by it.  I do admit however that I think it is only because of Norton.  This movie is brutal at times and laden with profanity....not for the faint of heart.  It also serves as a great example of the power of brainwashing and redemption.
B000069HZP|5.0|Can you imagen a movie with no victims and yet it's one of the best thrillers ever made?! When I heard that director is David Fincher who is responsible for hits such as Seven or Fight Club and that Michael Douglas has leading role, that was more than enough for me to buy it. And I didn't regret it: This film is one wild ride through every aspect of your mind. Just in the moment you think - It's all clear now, next one will leave you with your mouths open. Every scene is one big surprice for you and for main character Nicholas, who is cold rich businessman, who cutted all bonds between him and his family and friends just for power and more money. But his brother's present for his birthday will change everything. One moment, he's on the top of the world, next one he is down in rags, fearing for his life; confused and with no confidence in anyone. That is the price when you are in The Game. Michael prooved that he worths dozen Oscars and Sean Penn is also very good. If you like fast, confusing and surpricing thrillers, this is a movie for you. Note: Ending is unforgetable!!!
B0001KL5DA|5.0|I enjoy this show, its shocking scenes, the characters and the stories that the creaters, writers, directors and actors have crafted together to make this show are incredible.  Each of them has aspects that many people can identify with, and in turn get annoyed with, frustrated with and be happy for.  Beginning each episode is a death and a backstory of how that person died and then the Fisher family takes over.  I've only seen the first season, but I can imagine the complexities of character development in this season are equally interesting and heartbreaking.
B00005ATZT|5.0|That is well known sentence from this action hit which put an Oscar in hands of Tommy Lee Jones. Somebody killed dr. Richard Kimble's (Ford) wife, but all clues are against him. After all, who can be stupid enough to say that - One arm man did it?! His escape after bus accident will be his second chance to proove his innocents. But, that will be damn hard. Especially because after him is federal marshal who &quot;doesn't care&quot; about anything, except to bring the fugitive back (by any costs). Kimble will discover that he was in strong net made of lies and conspiracy, and that his only way out is to find proofes to clear his name and bring killer in front of justice. Jones supposed to be a good guy, but you'll hate him all the movie (well, it's not his falt, he's just good actor). Harrison is great, older, but still in  good shape. Since Indiana Jones, he never has better role than this. You'll be right next to him, trying to solve the puzzle, hoping that he will succeed to find who ruined his life. Excellent story, good locations and ideas. Definetly collection material.
B000094DUP|5.0|Delta Goodrem, some of you may be familiar with her character Nina in Aussie Soap Neighbours, and whilst she has been made a household name in Aus for her role in Neighbours - it is her music that has shone through.<br />Having a record deal way before Neighbours, Delta has proven that it is not just about how much an act is promoted that makes them a success, as her UK fans will know, poor promotional didn't stop this album becoming a huge success in the UK. She is beyond her years, her lyrics and her voice are truly amazing, and Delta is able to crossover into the adult market.<br />Featuring the 5 Australian Number Ones, &quot;Born To Try&quot;, &quot;Lost Without You&quot;, &quot;Innocent Eyes&quot;, &quot;Not Me, Not I&quot; and &quot;Predictable&quot;. And the top 5 UK hits &quot;Born to try&quot;, &quot;Lost without you&quot;, Number 9 smash &quot;Innocent Eyes&quot; and top 20 hit &quot;Not Me, Not I&quot; - Delta has once again broken many barriers.<br />After tragically being diagnosed with Cancer, a few weeks after her album went in at Number 2 in the UK as kept Beyonce's album off the top In Aus - it went from one extreme to another, but Delta stayed positive and has finished her chemo and radio-therapy. <br />Meanwhile, her career has taken off strongly in Germany as well, where she has racked up a top 20 position for her album &quot;Innocent Eyes&quot;, the album has now just taken off in Canada as well - proving Sony have the faith in Delta, who is soon to begin her USA Campaign. <br />The success is endless, but word of mouth was the reason Delta was able to become so successful in the UK where her album has sold over 750,000. The album featuring all the hits, has some album gems as well - I personally have a few favourites of my own, &quot;A Year Ago Today&quot; is the standout track on what I would say is my personal best debut album of all time, and my favourite album of 2003.<br />Delta has had much to do with this album, even producing another two of my particular favourites &quot;Will You Fall for Me&quot; and the stunning &quot;In My Own Time&quot;. <br />I cannot praise this album enough, if you don't have it already you really are missing out on an album that truly took 2003 by storm, there is no filler on this album - and each song has its own personal meaning, you easily become attached to every song on here - with uplifting and inspiring songs to ones that can literally make you cry - I cannot wait for the follow-up.
1401300901|3.0|Cecelia Ahern's debut doesn't hit a home run here, but she doesn't quite strike out either.  Yes, the author is callow, and this is quite evident in her writing, but the author does have potental.  In this story with quite an original plot, Holly receives ten envelopes with instructions from her recently deceased husband, who planned quite a bit in his last few months of life.  Holly is about to embark on a journey that will change her and her friends forever.  The tasks that Gerry has for Holly are great, ranging from singing karoake to more practical things like buying a lamp so she doesn't stub a toe.  While the plot is good, the characters tend to be annoying, and flat.  You only see Holly change somewhat, and you see her older brother Richard undergo some changes.  Everyone else kind of is just there.  Not bad for a first novel.
B0000C7PQK|2.0|I am an insatiable Enigma fan.  This is my favorite group of all time.  I bought MXC before it ever hit it big, and I marked on my calendar with excitement for the every three years Enigma puts out a record.  I own every album, every remix and every DVD.  This album is good, but it is missing all the brilliant layering of the earlier albums.  &quot;The Screen Behind the Mirror&quot; keeps getting degraded on these reviews but it is a far better album than Voyageur.  At least the signature Enigma sound is intact on that album.  Cretu has become FAR too in love with his voice on this album and it actually ruins some otherwise good songs.  Also, the lyrics are unbelievably cheesy at times.  The album will grow on you, but it is still an overall disappointment.<br />PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE GO BACK TO YOUR OLD SOUND ENIGMA!  You can still &quot;explore&quot; the boundaries of music with your old sound intact.

0783232039|5.0|While at one point i would have said that Chucky 2 was the best Chucky film of the whole saga, i just watched the Bride of Chucky and changed my mind completely. The Bride of Chucky is full of horrific scenes, full of gore and lunacy, yet this movie does not fail to bring several laughs. Chucky and his girlfriend Tiffany not only bring about hell yet they also bring about humor, which i think is a very important part of this movie which makes it so unique. John Ritter also plays an excellent role as the evil uncle of teenager Jade, and literally attempts to break the relationship between herself and her young love Jesse. In this movie, Chucky and Tiffany play the roles of an excellent dynamic duo, who are not only portrayed as crazy villians, but heroes as well. They manage to kill off several seemingly &quot;evil&quot; characters, yet also maintain their evil qualities and characteristics, which brings a whole different side to Chucky's character. Chucky is able to evolve in this movie as a true CHARACTER, showing that he has different dimensions to his character such as a satirical sense of humor. He is not just portrayed as a serial killer doll like in the  first three films. Overall this is a combination of both comedy and horror, a rarity in films, and it definitely does not fail to deliver excellence. I must reccomend this ilm. The ending also left many people to wonder if there would be a 5th film, and there will be: &quot;The Seed of Chucky&quot;. Hopefully that brings an end to one of the best horror sagas. All in all, at first i was skeptical in buying it but when i watched it i realized the price was worth it, the 90 minutes were largely enjoyable, and the film overall was brilliant

B00005A46T|1.0|This album is absolutly horrible. Slipknot has no idea what they are doing. They just throw a bunch of crap together and call it music. This cd is very weak and lacks any kind of intensity. It should be in the pop section. Don't buy this cd. You'll regreat it, if you do!
B000050X31|5.0|Why are these people objecting to a black Pamina when numerous white sopranos sing Aida, Turandot, Butterfly etc. You racist bigots with warped morals!!! Utter shame on all of you!
B0001NBMBC|1.0|The only reason I gave this cd one star is because you can't go lower! It dosen't deserve any stars at all. Slipknot is a crapy band and their music sucks! Don't buy this cd. Buy something really heavy and brutal, instead. If you buy this cd, you will just end up takeing it outside and hiting it with a baseball bat!
0375758992|5.0|Don't Let's Go to the Dogs Tonight by Alexandra Fuller is an extraordinary memoir of growing up white in war ravaged Africa.  Alexandra, called Bobo by her family, was born in 1969 in England. Her parents moved the family to Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) in 1972. Always suffering from &quot;bad, bad luck&quot;, which included losing three children, the family moves from farm to farm within Rhodesia and Malawi.<br />Fuller's writing style is rich, lyrical and many times, funny. I could picture the land, feel the heat and smell the smoking fish that embodies the Africa she describes. I found myself laughing even as I was shaking my head in disbelief at some of the choices her parents made. Bobo's mother, Nicola Fuller, is racist, resilient, strong and mad as a hatter. In other words, she's the most memorable character in the book.<br />Of course, to Fuller all of this stress and strife was, while not exactly normal, expected. She was a child, after all, and it's all she'd ever known. As I was reading, I couldn't help but think that American kids really have no idea how hard their life could be.<br />Overall a captivating read. It left me reminiscing about my childhood and reflecting on how simple and uncomplicated (read boring) it was.
B00000JCOV|1.0|This cd is pure crap. Slipknot is not now or will they ever, ever, ever, ever, ever be metal! Don't waste your money on this cd. There are so many real metal bands out there that you could spend your money on. You will hate yourself if you buy this cd.
B00009L1TA|5.0|If you don't like to think while you're watching a movie then stop reading this and go rent some overblown blockbuster.  Basic is an incredible movie with more viable twists than I've seen in any other movie.  It's fun to watch it multiple times simply to try to figure out how it all fits together (which, I assure you, it does).  I can't help but like Travolta in this movie, and Jackson is always great.  Critics panned the movie in theaters- more proof that critics actually don't think themselves- but everyone I've shown it to has enjoyed it.  If you like suspense/mystery, then don't miss this one.
B00005JLEU|1.0|The only cool part in this three-hour eye-glazing inscrutable meandering unengaging overwrought plotless wad of celluloid is when the parents turn their heads to that whiny dejected bland one-dimensional bipolar waif what's-her-name after they've been eating at the table.  What's three seconds divided by three hours?  Answer:  the movie was .000277 fun.  That iota of satisfaction was dimmed by the resentment one of spending $25 on it, and two of all the glowing reviewers who are obviously unfamiliar with all the cool Anime that Japan has exported here for twenty-odd years.  The act of composing my review is dredging up unwelcome images so absurd and stilted that they're laughable amidst the Homeric tragedy that they may remain lodged in my subconscious in remission for some time, perhaps forever.
B00005JM0B|5.0|I went to this movie thinking that it was just an attempt to milk the franchise for money.  Suffice it to say, I was wrong.  On a superficial level, T3 boasts much more impressive special effects, more likable characters, and even a laugh here and there.  Schwarzenegger and Danes especially put on very enjoyable performances.  What I didn't expect was that the plot would actually justify the use of all these effects.  I really don't want to spoil the plot, but I will say that it puts a very appropriate spin on the themes that the trilogy had been building up to this point.  Don't be fooled by the bad reviews here- this is the best of the trilogy!
0596004966|5.0|For many years, I did most of my programming in C, but never learned C++.  In recent years, I have been using Java mostly.    Now I wish to get back to C++, and I have found this book to be an excellent introduction.  In order to read this book one already needs to know how to work with the very low level aspects of C, and at the same time one must understand object oriented concepts.  But for the reader who is at such a place, this book provides a very concise description of the C++ language.  In just 125 small pages, the author manages to step through all of the aspects of the C++ language and concisely describe them.
B0000VAFO0|5.0|This movie turned out to be the opposite of what I expected.  I expected to watch a really sucky plot with some sweet action scenes.  Instead I got a movie with very good action scenes but, more importantly, a very interesting plot.  In fact, much of the plot is an appropriation of Romeo and Juliet- down to the complexity with which the two families are characterized (more so on the vampire side).  At the same time, Underworld seems to be the first to effectively bring to screen the image of the Neo-vampire.  We see vampires that have &quot;civilized&quot; themselves to the point that they use only synthetic blood for feeding and prey on humans only at a minimal rate.  The entire weaving of the gothic structures and modern city-scape has been done before- but in few movies so well as in this one.  This is really a word-of-mouth hit as more people are sharing the dvd with their friends.  Don't miss it. ...And I am definitely keeping my fingers crossed for a sequel!
B00005JMJ4|1.0|How this movie won so many awards, I will never know.  It has to be one of the most boring and rediculous movies I have seen in a LONG time.  It is, actually, one of the VERY few movies that I have stopped because I couldn't take it anymore...another one being Blair Witch Project 2, if that tells you anything.  I did, however, finish it after reading how the ending was so great.  I don't know what is so great about the cut-off ending that was there.  Horrible.  The movie has NO plot.  It is the same thing again and again.  Bill Murray looking boring and depressed, walking around one of the greatest cities in the world...poor him.  I rarely give movies bad ratings, even if they do suck, but this one was horrible.  What compounds the idea is that it won so many awards...HOW??  Don't waste your time.
B0001MDP3G|5.0|I saw this movie and was stunned the whole way through! The story was fantastic, the setting breath-taking, and the characters steeped in perfection! Academy Award winning performance was given by Renee Zellweger (as usual). In fact, if she doesn't win for this movie I may never watch another movie again. And everytime they cut to another scene there was another big-name actor/actress playing quirky bit parts like they were leads! I am watching this movie again and again. It was real, just plain real. The events in the movie did, at times, contain sex, violence, and debauchery, but it was not overdone in the traditional Hollywood style. Nothing was too much or too little! If you don't watch this movie then I would consider having your head examined.
B000002J09|5.0|I think this is the best rock album of all-time, 60s, 70s, 80s, 90s, all of it.  It came out in 1971 and still has the best guitar solos and catchiest songs you'll hear.  Page has to be one of the best guitarists ever, up there with Santana, Clapton, Hendrix, Van Halen, etc.  This album, Led Zeppelin's fourth installment, is my favorite album of the bunch, fueled by the great rock tunes of Rock and Roll, Black Dog, and Four Sticks, and the epic songs of When the Levee Breaks and Stairway to Heaven.  Stairway to Heaven alone, spanning 8:03, by itself makes the album classic and worth buying.  However, all of the songs on this are classic, and have obviously lasted the test of time.  I'm more of a rap fan than rock, honestly, but I love classic rock now because I heard this album.  Can't possibly recommend it any higher-BUY IT NOW
B000002UZ4|5.0|the real kings of pop music are so overlooked these days. But it doesn't matter: We, the ones who understand how good they are are having lots of fund and sheer quality. This is the first greatest hits from this unique band preceding their other golden item Popart. While it collects the entire catalogue of the Boys this is only up to 1991 and it has the wonderful Was It Worth it? I discovered them by chance when I heard their song I don't Know what you want but..from the Nightlife era and I have been collecting their items since then. Discography is a must for anyone having a good taste in music. These guys are simply geniuses no matter what the overproud Amazon.com reviewer says.<br />Boys, you are always on my mind!
B00005JMEW|5.0|I Thought This Movie Was Great. I Love Quentin Taratino Movies.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|Really now! I know everyone has their own oppinions, but I can't see what there is to like about this movie.  I thought I was the most patient person on the planet, (I even sat through Solaris) but what was the point in this movie?  I'd rather count all the stars in the sky then see this movie again.<BR>It seems as if Sofia Coppola ever wants to win another oscar all she has to do is film clothing in the dryer, because this movie is that exciting.
B00005YXZH|5.0|I'm not at all a fan of whatever genre Wilco were before this album. I've never heard any Uncle Tupelo, and I don't own any other Wilco alubms.<br />Which is to let you know that coming to this album completely out of the blue, on the basis of great reviews, hype and friends who are fans, I'd have to say this album is pure genius.<br />If they ever were country, or anything like what passes for country these days, this album is a miracle. It is intelligent and innovative (everything most country is not) and yet, somehow the songs are all simple and catchy as possible.<br />A beatiful mix of songwriting, experimentation and whatever additional genius went into it.
B0001P2IUY|2.0|Sehr schade, dass dieser, doch recht aktuelle Film, keinen guten Sound hat - nur &quot;Dolby Surround&quot;!<br />Wenigstens Dolby Digital 2.0 w&auml;re doch drin gewesen - deshalb nur 2 Punkte!ar
B000084T18|1.0|This cd is horrible. This guy can't rap, write music, spell his mom's name, etc. It rips off from greats like Vanilla Ice and Eminem. Don't waste your money and time on this stinker.
B00006879E|4.0|I Was a little hesitent to get this album. But i love it now. the 2 singles are the best songs on the cd. The only thing i dont like is that most of the other songs sound almost the same..but it was really nice
B000000JO3|5.0|Oh...my....goodness, this record is the epitome of hardcore punk.  The word &quot;hardcore&quot; was invented in D.C. and I can see why.  Along with the Bad Brains, Minor Threat laid the foundation for D.C. Hardcore.  The live performances were amazing, just imagine legions of screaming hardcore kids throwing up their X-markered hands and shouting out lyrics to their favorite Minor Threat songs. That is what it was like on a typical show night in D.C. in '81 or '82.  Although Minor Threat were not the first group of straightedgers to come along(Teen Idles), they preached it in songs like no other band.  Simply listen to the song &quot;Straightedge,&quot; and you'll see what I mean.  <br />The album starts off strong, with Ian yelling out about people who have changed, people who won't shut up, and people doing things that are ridiculous.  &quot;Filler&quot; gets the album off to a wonderful start.  Then comes &quot;I Don't Wanna Hear It&quot;, another exciting track.  In the midst of all the F Bombs that are dropped, comes &quot;Straightedge&quot;, the anthem for all straightedgers.  Clocking in at only :43 seconds, it's still one of the best hardcore sing alongs ever.  The album keeps a steady pace for a while, then comes &quot;Guilty Of Being White&quot;, my favorite Minor Threat song.  The song is about Ian being fed up with everyone who blames him for being white, he can't help it, and, obviously, he feels like he's guilty of being white.  &quot;Out Of Step&quot; is the original straightedge rule song.  &quot;Don't smoke...Don't drink....Don't f---, at least I can f------g think.&quot;  The album ends with a couple of Minor Threat's forgotten classics, &quot;Good Guys (Don't Wear White)&quot; and &quot;Salad Days&quot;.  Please don't &quot;Go out, fight, fight&quot;....and get this album...it will be in your cd player for months.
B000089RVX|3.0|Even though this band is highly over-rated i still like this album. Amy Lee's unique voice(and shes soooo hot) really make this band great. The only songs i listen to now are everbody's Fool, my immortal, bring my to life and going under(the singles). no other songs stand out though. i think the next albums going to be a lot better(at least im hoping) Overall: Good, But not Good Enough.    Good effort though.
B00005MP58|1.0|Thoroughly unsatisfying, despite the presence of the always spectacularly sexy Colin Firth.  The major flaw here is the horribly miscast Jennifer Ehle as Elizabeth.  She looks right, but is way too humorless, heavy, and grim in personality--all wrong for a character who wins the love lottery largely because of her sprightly wit and sweetness.  <br />In addition, Jane Austen's delicious dialogue is dumbed-down unforgivably in key moments.  And the many minor characters who are supposed to offer piquant commentary on the money and love problems in this story are horribly mishandled. The actors are both weak and wrong, their scenes curtailed and stripped of meaning. This is Jane Austen done by people with NO FEELING for Jane Austen.<br />The earlier BBC version with Elizabeth Garvey was superior in every way.  And even without Colin Firth, ten times as romantic-- which is, after all, the whole point.
B00005YJMX|5.0|Remakes don't get much better that this, lets give a round of applause to the drictor, it's hard to make a remake of a classic film. So the film follows the story of the orignal, some guy goes to see Dracula, who he later bits( the guy goes crazy). Dracula later takes a ship to England and starts a rampage of death. This film does not have as much action as the first but it's still fun to wach. Make-up for Dracula rocked. Worth every penny.
B000003TA4|5.0|I don't care how many of you love to bash Nirvana.  Nirvana was and always will be one of the best bands to ever exist. They showed their talent when they did the MTV Unplugged in New York.  They showed the whole world that they could really play, and the fact that they didn't even attempt to play acoustic versions of their biggest hits like Smells Like Teen Spirit, Lithium, or In Bloom is remarkable.  As any \\"artist\\" today that makes an unplugged does nothing but adjust their hits to an acoustic format and play on.  But this review is for Nevermind, and I have to say that in my opinion this album is one of the best albums I've heard.  The music is great and no matter what many people here say (specially that pathetic loser who calls himself AFI James or some sh*t like that), this album changed music.  It drove out sh*tty hair bands like Poison and helped introduce us to Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, and Alice in Chains, among others.  It's a shame that Kurt Cobain died, because we will never know what path music could have took.
B000268QB2|4.0|What would happen if you took Travis' soul, Ben Folds instrumentation and added a hint of Freddy Mercury's voice?  You'd get Keane.  If you didn't like Travis' middle 2 CDs (The Man Who&quot; and &quot;Invisible Band&quot;), then you probably won't like this.  This is much more Travis than Coldplay or Radiohead.  The music does get a little same-sounding as it goes on, but overall it's a good, beautiful, if almost entirely unaggressive debut.
B000002NFM|5.0|Prodigy has always been a great band.  Mixing several genres and coming up with something that is not crap.  I love this album from beginning to end.  Prodigy's \\"The Fat of the Land\\" is to Electronica what \\"Nevermind\\" is to Rock.  Favorite tracks on this album are \\"Smack my Bitch Up\\", Breathe\\", \\"Mindfields\\", \\"Narayan\\", \\"Firestarter\\", and \\"Climbatize\\".
0060977493|5.0|Really poetic prose. It's a pity she seems to have given up on fiction.<br />My only criticism would be that Roy uses the phrase &quot;a viable die-able age&quot; once too often. A minor criticism, I know, but it did annoy me a bit.
B000006NPY|4.0|At a first listen I thought to myself, &quot;This CD sucks! Why the hell did I buy it?&quot;.  But after deciding to give it a chance and repeated listenings, it started to grow on me.  I see why people didn't like this CD, because it's nothing like the Pumpkins we're used to listen with their blazing guitars, powerful drums, and angry vocals. Instead, this album is filled with chords, harps, and keyboards.  The vocals are now about personal losses, love, and relationships.<br />I give it 4 stars because at some points it can be a bit boring, not because it's bad.  My favorite tracks are &quot;Ava Adore&quot;, &quot;Perfect&quot; (which sounds like a B-Side to 1979), &quot;Appels + Oranjes&quot;, &quot;Pug&quot;, and &quot;Annie-Dog&quot;.
0743243315|3.0|The main story, told from the perspective of a Bangladeshi immigrant in London, is wonderfully written. Unfortunately, the other big thread of the narrative is told through the letters of her sister back in Bangladesh, who is supposedly uneducated; and to convey this, the author unwisely chose to have these &quot;letters&quot; written in a horrible, unreadable broken English (it felt almost along the lines of &quot;me tarzan, you jane&quot; at times). These sections were so unreadable, in fact, that I was unable to finish this book. A pity... the London bits are truly beautiful prose, but averaged out to a 3 due to the awful broken English letters.
B000002LHX|5.0|During the LOVESEXY TOUR in 1988 Prince was asked by TIM Burton and Jack Nicolson to do some music for the upcoming BATMAN movie. Nicholson and Burton were fans of the Purple One and thought his groovy style would work. In retrospect Burton was later quoted in Rolling Stone during the Batman Returns edition as saying otherwise however, Prince provided something weird and yummy that really did go with that movie. You see Prince was allowed to view the rough cut of that movie and within two weeks in his Minnesota Paisley Park studios recorded this opus. It was during this time that PRINCE recorded weird tracks such as RAVE UN 2 The JOY FANTASTIC, The BATMAN THEME and 200 Balloons. None of these really went over well so the first two were discarded while 200 Balloons made it onto the big screen. The album followed the BATMAN hysteria that swept the nation and eventually became a hit for PRINCE spawning a number one song called BATDANCE. In 1989 BATMAN was king both at the box office and merchandise thus signaling the end of the 1980's and the start of many things new. As a part of the soundtrack Prince incorporated peices of dialogue from the film's stars: Kim Basinger, Michael Keaton and Jack Nicholson in order to create a dramatic play within the album. He also introduced a character named GEMINI who is  part Batman and part Joker. The result was a dual character faced with inner demons and wanting the love of Vicky Vale. Now, that's pretty dramatic don't u think? I think this was the plot of the movie itself. The album spawned two other hits such as SCANDALOUS, The ARMS of Orion (a duet with SHEENA EASTON) and Partyman. Prince appeared as Gemini in the video versions for Batdance and Partyman which were extremely lavish, dramatic and incredibly over the top!!! These videos were amazing as the songs because  the characters  unfolded like some kinda soap opera from another planet. The last video featured Prince sans makeup and Gemini character in a red jumpsuit singing the amazingly lush and beautiful SCANDALOUS which is one of Prince's best songs ever. Scandalous appears at the end of the film's credits in a very chopped up version that is just wrong. What is amazing about the record is that it signaled a departure for Prince from his odd LOVESEXY album both in sound and artistic approach. The new age religous babble that came before was discarded for a more heavy metal, funk, and orchestral sound that is evident in funky tracks such as Lemon Crush, Electric Chair,The Future, and Vicky Waiting which were not hits but just as tasty. Check out an acoustic version of Electric Chair/Vicky Waiting in the movie during the Bruce Wayne party over at the mansion. What makes this album so amazing is that it reminds us of Prince's earlier work like Let's Go Crazy, Take Me with U and 1999 all rolled up into one package. Unfortunately, this soundtrack has been largely ignored by the same people behind the BATMAN hype that helped create it, Warner Brothers. Oddly enough 2005 will bring about BATMAN BEGINS, the new long awaited movie with a new DVD release of the first two BATMAN movies according to director Tim Burton with what some speculate the videos from this album but this remains uncomfirmed.
B00003CXXJ|3.0|I must say that I had been looking forward to it. Now I liked the Shrek character and seeing all those from the fairy tales. But still, too crude and not very origanl. Eddie Murphy's voice was annoying most of the time (Like watching Buddy Love). <BR>Although it's not for young kids, it's watchable.
B000002L9B|5.0|Take one underrated pop star and a kick butt band and you have one amazingly delicious album that goes unheard!!!!! It all began with 1985's Around The World in A Day which was not exactly a hit as Rolling Stone called it \\"Around The World In a Daze\\"  that all the clues for this fell into place. In a track called Condition of the Heart Prince sang about Clara Bow, the silent movie actress from the 1920's whom Prince had an interest for. The idea of making a movie would not be far behind however, there were already problems within the Prince camp. His super genius had created smashing hits for The Bangles (Manic Monday) and Apollona 6 had called it quits!!! Leaving his next creation The Family to follow in his footsteps but this was not to be. Their self titled album would spawn a very minor hit called The Screams of Passion and also include a small song titled NOTHING COMPARES 2 U which later would be a hit for some bald woman. In the scurry of things Prince would travel to France and create a cinematic flop (which is far better than Graffitti Bridge) called UNDER THE CHERRY MOON.The soundtrack from that movie would be named PARADE (originally titled LITTLE WENDY'S PARADE after guitarist WENDY MELVOIN). Only a handful of the songs appear on the film which isn't bad considering that two of the album's B sides (ALEXA DE PARIS and LOVE OR $) fill in quite nicely. This is important because they do not appear on the album and were only available on the actual vinyl singles for Kiss and Mountains. The album itself opens with Christopher Tracy's Parade a soaring number that includes theme park sound effects to create an atmospheric upper mood. The middle of the album is filled with funky filler songs such as I Wonder U, New Position, and Life Can Be So Nice which are all great but womewhat odd. The album's highlights include the funky upbeat Mountains which features a killer horn section and guitar by Miko Weaver (of Rick James fame), BOYS AND GIRLS with its French horn section and contagious Euro flavor, Venus De Milo an often overlooked instrumental that features some of the best piano playing reminiscent of the late Ray Charles era, and Sometimes It Snow in April which features Wendy Melvoin and Prince in a very somber but beautiful guitar/vocal duet that is just a killer. Parade was the last album with Prince's legendary band, The Revolution and it's a shame because he never actually captured this kinda funk ever again unless you count Sign Of The Times which did feature The Revolution on some tracks. Parade was not a commercial success like Purple Rain but it did provide a song set that is really a testament to Prince's complexity as a artist and creative force behind modern music. The only real hit that came out of this was KISS a song originally slated for Prince's musical funk band MAZARATI. The song was discarded by the band only to appear on the album and become another smash. Overall, this album is one of my favorites because of its wide array of musical styles that remained largely ignored. It followed in the footsteps of Around the World In A Day (another of my favorites)  which was not an easy task in itself. This album for me took me back to the days of Ray Charles, Herb Albert and The Tijuana Brass because that's what you get here. It is a great mixture of sounds and tastes that did not fare well with people who were expecting Purple Rain part 2. He took a creative leap and added to the musical spectrum...sadly this is not what radio is made for but I don't because it will outlast radio itself.
B0001CCXY8|2.0|One has to wonder how someone can devote their musical career to telling the same joke over and over again and still get taken seriously.<BR>The joke is: \\"Hey, we'll play the most extreme music possible, overdub a singer throwing up blood on top of it, and then give it a title like 'Blunt Force Castration' or something equally ridiculous.\\"<BR>Admittedly, that's hilarious. However, I can't see how someone would want to spend upwards of $200 getting 11 full length CDs of this silliness.<BR>As I've seen, there are 2 types of Cannibal Corpse fans: people who get the joke, and people who don't. The people who don't are the ones who gush about \\"complex riffing, tempo-changes and sheer brutality\\". Come on guys, there are more complex bands out there, and many bands who convey \\"brutality\\" much more convincingly than these clowns.<BR>It's ok to like cheesy horror movies, but don't ever think they're Oscar material.
6302158095|5.0|This is a classic marriage of two art forms Music and Animation. There are six sets of classical pieces By the Philadelphia Orchestra under the leadership of Leopold Stokowski. Each piece is accompanied by animation that either tells a story or illustrates visually the music. Each piece is a feast for the eyes and ears. The most famous piece is Mickey Mouse as the sorcere's apprentice. He gets ahold of his master's magical hat and decides to take a short cut indoing his chores with disastrerous results. The two pieces that really stand out for me is the &quot;Nutcracker Suite&quot; and &quot;Night on Bald Mountain&quot; This is a great movie for anyone who enjoys classical music. It may be too &quot;High Brow&quot; for children but it could be a good medium to introduce them to classical music.

B00005ASHM|4.0|Few albums appear to provoke such strong feelings like Pet Sounds.  Its placement atop Rolling Stone's &quot;100 Greatest Albums&quot; list has received considerable praise; and resentment. To emphasize the point, look at this page, which is not so much a collection of &quot;reviews&quot; of the album as it is a message board for Pet Sounds/Beach Boys fans and critics.  What a shame.<br />What is lost in the controversy and debate surrounding the &quot;greatness&quot; of the album, is the album itself.  Pet Sounds is a beautiful, unique, and compelling work.  That it was an innovative, influential album, praised by critics, fans, and musicians - like Paul McCartney - alike, is irrefutable.  Is it THE second greatest album of all time?  Who cares?  Make up your own mind.  Lists like that are only one group of people's opinions and are so subjective, to place much stock in them, much less get worked up over them, is foolish.<br />And, particularly you Beatles fans here, don't feel so threatened by the album or its &quot;ranking.&quot; If Sir Paul isn't sweating the Beach Boys - why should you?  I personally find the Beatles early music dull and simple, and the later stuff, contrived and pompous.  But I do recognize their place in the annals of rockology.  I'm certainly not going to make ridiculous, unfounded statements like, &quot;George Martin actually composed their music,&quot; or &quot;Sgt. Pepper is the most overrated album of all time.&quot;<br />If you are going to criticize the Beach Boys and Brian Wilson, at least get your facts straight.  For the record, John had Paul, Paul had John, and they both had George Martin.  Brian Wilson had Brian Wilson.  He wrote and produced Beach Boys albums, like Pet Sounds, entirely by himself.  The only thing he collaborated on was LYRICS - not the music - so direct your critiques of the album's lyrics at Tony Asher and don't suggest someone was helping Brian compose or produce the music.  Also, don't criticize Brian for using professional studio musicians on his albums; unless you're actually stupid enough to think that's the Fab Four playing the orchestra parts on all those Beatles albums.  Its statements like these that only reveal your own ignorance.<br />No, the Beach Boys didn't smash their guitars, like the Who - or light them on fire, like Hendrix.  Brian Wilson wasn't trying to be a poet/preacher like Dylon or Lennon, or a revolutionary like Morrisson.  The Beach Boys did their own thing; and some people get it and some people don't.  Its as simple as that.
B0001LJC2K|5.0|I didn't even realize that these guys were sounding similar to Radiohead until a friend pointed it out.  And I thought I was a big Radiohead fan.  It's true, it's there, but what I was focused on for so long was how worked up they get, how they beat the snot out of the toms (no pun intended), and how they just rock out in good old fashioned retro '70s style.  Grab your mullet wig and a Noam Chomsky book and enjoy.
6304457391|3.0|That is General James Matoon Scott, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, played by Burt Lancaster. He is dismissive &amp; looks down on everyone including the president whom he despises for his perceived weakness. The President (Fredrick March) has decided to unilaterally disarm our nuclear weapons. General Scott will attempt to seize power. This concerns  Col. &quot;Jiggs&quot;  Casey, (Kirk Douglas) Scott's chief of staff &amp; best friend. Douglas's character is the key. He informs the president of the plot, as it becomes known to him &amp; contacts Scott's old mistress (Ava Gardner). Edmund O'Brien won an Oscar as the president's best friend, a drunken southern senator. Rounding out the fine cast is Martin Balsam as a presidential advisor. The suspense builds as they attempt to stop the coup. No special effects here, very little action of any kind.<BR>  Frankenheimer has a more subtle touch in this movie, the follow-up to the Manchrian Canidate. This one is not quite as good but still an engossing flick.
0671027344|1.0|I should have known better - any book that is published by MTV Books MUST represent the lowest fodder the literary world has to offer. MTV has NO place in literature, as their audience is made up of teen bops from suburbia who wouldn't know a good thing if it came up and poked out their eyeballs.<BR>What can I say about this book? I think a few reviewers put it best when they said it represents every single boring and tedious cliche known to \\"teen lit\\" - sex, drugs, loserdom and the like. Why is every single \\"teen lit\\" book going over the same ole nonsense over and over again? I didn't find Charlie to be particularly interesting or easy to relate to - certainly not to the point of calling this book a \\"classic.\\" There are too many cliches and hum-drum narrations for it to be considered anything more than fodder. (...) <BR>MTV should give up the jig already and stay the heck away from books.
B000002KE2|4.0|After primarily concentrating on heavy metal with killer riffs on their first three albums, Volume 4 showed Black Sabbath adding new elements to their sound. Many times when bands do this they're usually unsuccessful and go back to their roots on their next album. But the diversity works well here and surprisingly it's the heavier stuff that doesn't work nearly as well on Volume 4.<br />Not that the heavier stuff isn't good. The tracks &quot;Supernaut&quot; and &quot;Snowblind&quot; are certainly two of the better heavy songs that they've recorded with the former featuring a killer riff from Tony Iommi and the latter describing the effects of cocaine. The epics &quot;Wheels Of Confusion&quot; and &quot;Under The Sun&quot; are both good tracks, but not as definitive as other long tracks they've recorded like &quot;Iron Man&quot; and &quot;Children Of The Grave.&quot; However, this album is best known for the previously unchartered waters found in the piano ballad &quot;Changes&quot; and the strings and acoustic guitars of &quot;Laguna Sunrise.&quot; While these songs are truly a change of pace for the band, both work surprisingly well, especially &quot;Changes&quot; which has albeit on a smaller scale become to the band what &quot;Beth&quot; has become to Kiss, one of their most popular tracks despite sounding totally different from the rest of their catalog. The tracks &quot;Tomorrow's Dream&quot;, &quot;Cornucopia&quot;, and &quot;St Vitus' Dance&quot; are also decent, if not among their best work. A strong album, albeit not on the same level as Paranoid and Master Of Reality.

B000002BQK|5.0|I have to admit, I bought this album recently. I was all that I expected from mariah herself. Especially the Asian edition which has two bonus tracks. Both remixes of Honey. I've got that edition. it is easy to find in Malaysia. there are fourteen tracks on the asian edition in total. The two bonus tracks are hard to find on a Single release. their Honey (So So Def Remix) Feat. Da Brat and Honey (Def Club Mix) both good dance tracks to level the album to a v.good rate of interest. This album is a bit mature so it gives a picture of how far she's come in her music. Even so this album sold out quite a bunch. I hope Mariah will write albums like this. It is what she's best at. At Least this album and her other albums are better than Britney's horrible hoarse singing and J.Lo any day. Do not forget people. The only reason that remixes and RnB Music became famous was due to mariah's collaboration back in 1995 with ODB in fantasy was the spark to this period. It's people around here don't really realize how long mariah's been in the music industry compared to some of todays &quot;cheap artists&quot;! How can anyone compare her music to anyone. it's unique. Only stupid &quot;people&quot; would compare her music. So Go out and look for this album. Listen to it and see. would you buy Britney's trash IN THE ZONE or would you buy J.Lo's trash The Reel Me. I think we can see which one we'll buy. It's up to you. I'm just here to make a good comparison between good music and crap music.

0811729117|3.0|Tigers in the Mud is the story of Otto Carius's experience in tanks on the eastern front.  Of interest is how Otto started out at the beginning of Operation Barbarrosa as a tank's radio operator (Czech 38's), graduated to the officer corp and lead a Tiger platoon.  While there were many interesting story's in this book, unfortunately, Otto focused more on his time in Tigers than his earlier career (he did though mention how he initially liked the Czech 38, but after being knocked out and wounded, he thought it was pretty weak).<br />In the later portion of his career (43-45), Otto becomes much more descriptive about his operations and his opinion of events.  Otto was very descriptive about different generals, his opinion of Russians, and also his feelings about the Americans (after being wounded, he was assigned to lead Hunting Tigers).  What I found very interesting and bordering on insulting was his comments about how poor American tank operations were (he only fought against the Americans during  Patton's operations against Model's forces) and his feelings about Americans as his captors (he was very derogatory about us once he realized the Americans weren't going to send the Germans against the Russians).  One of the best parts of the book though was Otto's experience with the &quot;press&quot; (Otto was very derogatory about the &quot;press&quot; because they &quot;recorded&quot; things after the battle and didn't accurately portray the battle that occurred.  The one time he had a photographer ride with him, the man was scared to death!).<br />Otto is not humble (as Guy Sager was), is very proud of what he'd done (he kind of forgot that Tigers were on the top of the feeding list and forgot what it was like to have a tank that wasn't as capable as the Tiger in taking punishment), especially his awards, but is very good at describing what he and his teammates did on the western front.  Otto does preface the book by saying that the book was written for the 502 and that is what the focus of the book is, his experience in the 502.  With everything in perspective, the book is good, but not in the same calibre as The Forgotten Soldier.that is what the focus of the book is, his experience in the 502.

B00009V7T2|5.0|Unfortunately, none of the other reviewers mentioned that De-Loused In The Comatorium is a concept album based on the Mexican artist, Julio Venegas, a friend of Omar Rodriguez-Lopez (guitarist/bassist/songwriter) and Cedric Bixler Zavala (vocalist) who committed suicide. De-Loused is an fictional reality the artist may have experienced during the week he had slipped into a coma, where he argues wether to live or die. <BR>The album is intended to be listened to in its entirity, &quot;like a punk rock symphony in 10 movements.&quot; I am thoroughly impressed with this album, and holds a story and an identity separate from that of Sparta and At The Drive In.

630471193X|4.0|Phenomeonon was advertised as a sci-fi movie, and whilke it has a sci-fi sort of theme at its core, anyone going to see the movie based on that was sorely disappointed.<br />What this movie is, actually, is a story about a man learning to cope with something that he can't understand, and how it brings him closer to his friends and his community, and how it allows him to understand and deal with his own fate.<br />Yes, it's a bit sappy at times, but it also contains some really excellent performances. Travolta delivers what it certainly his most authentic and touching portrayal of a real human being yet seen in his post-Tarantino career. Forrest Whittaker and Robert Duvall likewise contribute first-rate performances. A wonderful contemporary soundtrack ties it all together.
B0001CCXZW|5.0|This is in response to the reviewer who wrote &quot;Missing An Episode&quot;. The set is NOT missing an episode! Dean breaks up with Rory in episode 16 &quot;Star-Crossed Lovers and Other Strangers&quot;. The first scene in &quot;The Breakup, Part II&quot; starts off exactly where episode 16 left off. Maybe you didn't pay attention to what happened in episode 16 but there clearly is NOT a break in the storyline. Hope this helps! I have wrote reviews before about how much I love this DVD! I could watch the episodes over and over again. The characters, setting, and storylines are consistently charming and heart-warming. If you haven't already, I would suggest that everyone goes out to buy this set.
B00005JMJ4|3.0|Lost in Translation has both its high and low points. I definately like the shots of Tokyo and the wonderful cinematography not to mention the soundtrack. Both Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson give nice polished performances that are not overacted to compensate for a script that is thin to say the least. I was expecting a little more in story/plot development after watching Sofia Coppula's the Virgin Suicides. Overall, I couldn't justify more than 3 stars, I mean even beautiful pictures can carry a movie only so far.
B00009TB5G|2.0|I've really had it with this whole fantasy/action movie wave that has been going on since Star Treck (and probably before that).  When I heard all the fuss about the Harry Potter series and the Lord of the Rings series, I had to shake my head and wonder if they really were as good as every one had hyped them up to be.  Well, I had the misfortune of seeing the first one in my AP Brit Lit class senior year in high school.  The only thing I really remember about the movie itself was how long the beginning dragged on and demanded that I wait patiently for the real meat of the story.  Let me tell you that I am not a patient guy when it comes to movies; if something is 2 + hours, it better hold my attention from the get-go.  I'll never forget my teacher coming up to me during the movie and saying &quot;You look really miserable; did you sleep poorly last night or something?&quot;  My response was &quot;This movie absolutely blows!  How are all of you so interested in this nothing of a story that is the equivalent to watching paint dry?&quot;  She then drops her jaw in awe and basically tells me that I have horrible tastes in movies, cause, like OMG, how could anyone not like this captivating movie?  I'll tell you how: IT BLOWS!!!!!!!!! (ok, maybe it's not all bad for the fans, but I couldn't tolerate it)  Then, not too long after this one comes out, my family forces me to watch it, fully aware of how much torture they knew it would be for me.  Somewhere around the 2 hour mark, I stood up and left; this fantasy crap does not amuse or baffle me.  It's not a complicated story, but when you are uninterested, and a movie such as this tries to portray itself as deep and intellectual when it really is not, you just can't follow the 98% of Americans who love this trilogy to death (I refuse to see the other one).  If you love it, that's good; you don't have bad tastes in movies, but don't label me as one of those morons who isn't smart enough to get it; I truely had one of the worst movie experiences of my life (except for maybe all of Rob Schneider's films) watching these two movies (I really felt like picking up a brick and chucking it at the TV), and I refuse to see anything in the Harry Potter series.  There, I feel better already.  Two stars, because, at least for what it tries to be, it can gain the interest of the fans.  But for me, I'd rather watch a great film like &quot;Shawshank Redemption&quot;, or a great comedy like &quot;Tommy Boy&quot; or &quot;Office Space&quot;.  What happened to movies like those anymore?

B000066C8G|5.0|&quot;Zoolander&quot; is one of those movies that, rather than sinks in it's own stupidity, soars in it (very rare).  It is one of those movies that Rob Schneider wishes he could make (and when he evolves into an actor with real talent, he will).  It's one of those movies that has one of the most ridiculous plots I've ever seen (Zoolander is brainwahsed to kill the Malasian prime minister, and the cast tries to save the prime minister; it is less of a plot than &quot;Billy Madison had, and I say that with total honesty).  Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson are great at being complete idiots who, when are told that there are files &quot;in a computer&quot;, take it literally.  Also, the movie tries to parody the modeling world, especially when Mostuafa (sp?) screams at one of his clients for being 5 pounds overweight, and succeeds with flying colors.  A great comedy that brings out the inner superficial moron in us all.

0316168815|2.0|My mother-in-law gave me this book to me to read, which was given to her by her older son, my brother-in-law.  It was not a topic to her liking, but she thought I might enjoy it.  Like many readers, I found the very first pages engrossing, but the prose got forced,the sentimentality too much, and the switching of bodies for the sake of some sort of happy ending of sexual union did it for me.  HUH?  The potential strength of the book is that it presents a wonderful opportunity for the kind of internal dialogue warranted by the unique situation of the narrator--she is in heaven and now sees everything from up there.  But by allowing her to have this extremely physical experience, the author squanders this wonderful opportunity, so the strength of the book becomes its weakness.  I suppose the prose can be captivating since it has the aura of an omniscient, stream-of-consciousness narrator, but then again, there are better stream-of-consciousness books.

B0001L3LUE|4.0|'The Fog of War' is yet another stellar film from the great documentarian Errol Morris.  Moris interviews former politician Robert S. McNamara, who talks about the history of his life from 1918 to present day.  Although the film has some powerful moments, it is ruined by Morris' overuse of film footage, photographs, and unnecessary filmmaking.  We are constantly bombarded by five second shots of graphs, numbers, and words as they flash on and off the screen in speedy fashion.  It gets annoying after a while.  Worth the watch if you are interested in a powerful man's perspective on World War II and the Vietnam War.
B000001FBS|4.0|If you don't have an open mind, don't buy this album!  It doesn't really &quot;sound&quot; like KISS.  Having said that, I really like it (Although my wife hates it).  I stayed away from this CD for a long time because it had a reputation of being terrible.  Of course, it's not terrible, just different.  I'm sure by now everyone knows it's a concept album about a boy fighting evil.  The music is very smooth, very polished.  It is worlds away from the raw sound KISS had in the seventies.  Every time I put this CD in and &quot;Only You&quot; comes on, I turn the player as loud as it will go!  I love the guitar riffs on this song.  Other strong efforts include &quot;Dark Light&quot; sung by Ace Frehley (Which turned out to be his last with KISS), &quot;Just a boy&quot; and &quot;I&quot;.  I wanted to give this disk 5 stars but couldn't bring myself to do it, because there are a couple of songs I just couldn't get into, i.e. &quot;Mr. Blackwell&quot; and &quot;Odessey&quot;.  A must have for true diehards, or somebody looking for something a little different.  Just don't expect &quot;Destroyer 2&quot;.
B0000AXE8I|3.0|It's almost a rule of thumb that a sequel is not as good as the original.  There are of course exceptions to this--although I disagree with the vast majority of reviewers, and do *not* find &quot;Godfather II&quot; to be a superior film to the original, or indeed even *as* good, but that's an article for another time--but in the main, it holds true.  Even for tripe like &quot;George of the Jungle&quot; and &quot;Inspector Gadget,&quot; the drop-off is usually noticible.<br />And so it is with &quot;The Matrix Reloaded,&quot; alas.  There are interesting ideas in this film, and good connective tissue between it and the first movie, but in the main, I have to say it bored me.  To say the film moves in fits and starts doesn't begin to state the case.  I was actually stunned by the alternation of long, expository scenes where one character (or much more rarely, two) sounds off at length about the nature of reality, the validity of the matrix, and the whichness of what.  Characters sit and talk (lecture is probably the more accurate term.)  Characters stand and talk.  Characters talk talk talk.  Then there's hyperkinetic action.  Somehow, one hopes that these two extremes would be better melded, but one hopes in vain in this particular film.<br />These scenes alternate with equally lengthy action sequences, some of which are enjoyable, but others of which were, honestly, for me pretty dull.  The fight sequence on the freeway, which got huge amounts of press, was for me stultifyingly boring.  After 5 minutes (it goes on for nearly 20!), I was looking at my watch.  It wasn't that the stunts were bad; it's just that the plot didn't *move at all* while we're watching this lengthy monument to action sequences.  And while I honestly enjoyed another sequence with Neo in the palace of a character called the Merovingian, even *that* one went on too long.  Honestly, the whipsawing of the movie between &quot;nothin' but lecturing&quot; and &quot;nothin' but fightin'&quot; got old for me.<br />I gave this movie 3 stars primarily because, as disappointing as it is, it is still vastly superior to most of the science fiction/action film crud that comes flooding out of Hollywood every year.  Compare this film to, say, &quot;Eraser,&quot; or &quot;The Punisher,&quot; and it rises by at least one star in the rankings.or me.<br />I gave this movie 3 stars primarily because, as disappointing as it is, it is still vastly superior to most of the science fiction/action film crud that comes flooding out of Hollywood every year.

B00024BHTC|5.0|Is there a way to give an album more than five stars!? If so &quot;Once&quot; deserves it. Nightwish's previous album &quot;Century Child&quot; has long been a favorite of mine. &quot;Once&quot; is a step above that. The album has more of a metal edge to it than &quot;Child&quot; as well as using the orchestra more. The entire album is a highlight, if you're a Nightwish fan you're sure to appreciate the growth they have undergone between &quot;Century Child&quot; and now. If you like metal mixed with a symphony you will love &quot;Once&quot;!!
B0000DD7LC|4.0|We all know Alicia Keys. We all heard \\"Fallin'\\" on the radio 93853 times. We all saw her win as many grammys that year. Under such conditions, it would be hard to make a solid sophomore effort. Somehow though, she did it. Keeping her beautiful piano playing and love of old school soul and r&b, Alicia has otherwise grown. There are less piano ballads and more slow-tempo grooves. Her singing ability has improved. Her emotive vocal power is at it's highest on \\"If I Ain't Got You\\" and attitude comes pouring through in her lyrics over the thump of \\"Karma.\\" Her lyrics have become more inventive. She is playful on the funk sounds of \\"Heartburn\\" and paints a picture of medieval sexual longing in the wordplay of \\"Dragon Days.\\" The sound of 60's motown pervades on \\"Wake Up,\\" 70's funk on \\"Dragon Days,\\" and a current R&B sound on \\"So Simple\\" and \\"Diary.\\"  All meld together perfectly. OK, she probably didn't need to remake a Gladys Knight song (no one will ever outsing or out emote that un-aging diva) especially by throwing \\"Walk on by\\" over it, but she holds her own. I say that this album is not quite a diary because it doesn't feel like she's really telling us anything about herself. As long as she keeps making high-quality and inventive music, I think she can stay as elusive as she likes.

B0001LJCPC|2.0|I loved the movies, and thought the soundtrack to Volume 1 of Kill Bill was fantastic. I eagerly snapped up Vol. 2, and was very upset to find it paled in comparison to Volume 1. Vol. 2 features more of a Southwestern/Latino sound that seems more down tempo and much more reserved than the first soundtrack. I won't bother going thru the individual songs, because to be honest, they left so little of an impression I doubt I could tell you much. The only reason I gave this album any stars was for the fantastic bits of dialogue which are included and David Carridine's telling the Legend of Pei Mei which were enjoyable. But I wouldn't spend over $5 for this disk unless you are just such a huge fan of the movie you need something to tide you over until the DVD comes out. Or better yet, hopefully they will put out a double CD with both soundtracks as well as bonus cuts?! Great movie, sub-standard soundtrack for Volume 2.
B00005JLWN|4.0|This film, a real sleeper, portrays a future totalitarian regime where human emotions are pharmacologically excised and creations that trigger emotions are outlawed.    The protagonist is a 'grammaton cleric', a super-martial artist SS-officer type who enforces this creed.  Our protagonist misses his dose and then explores a new path in his life.<BR>    I loved this movie for the very interesting martial arts and &quot;gun-kata&quot; action.   <BR>   Equilibrium is not as improbable as the matrix because it is more grounded in realism.   It's premise of a Bradburian Farenheit-451 / Orwellian regime is a bit shallow compared to those works.<BR>   It you like films about totalitarian regimes or futuristic martial arts violence, you will not be disappointed.  If you are disturbed by movies where body parts are sliced off, look elsewhere.
B000002HPV|5.0|I love this album! It was the third I bought from her, I started off with Post, then Gling-Gl, and next Homogenic. It is very dark, engaging, and smooth.      In the second song, Jga, she talks of \\"emotional landscapes.\\" When I listen to that song, I can imagine a panoramic view of a dark green mountain range with the burning orange light of the setting sun silhouetting each peak. I can also see endless fields of grass and flowers, perhaps in Switzerland. This song uses strings Bjrk's overpowering voice to create what she sings about: emotional landscapes and a \\"state of emergency.\\"      The song \\"Bachelorette\\" is a strikingly toxic song, it's very dark and beautiful. Again, the use of stringed instruments is a very nice touch and it creates a classic feel. This sounds like it could be a hit from some foreign musical, because it has a foreign quality to it. It is also very, very epic in its genre and sound. It gives the sense of a grand tale being told with its bold and melancholy music.      \\"All Neon Like\\" is a calming song with an infectious beat. Bjrk has a nack for smoothing out whatever annoying sounds you can imagine! The beat is a techno-like pulse, but almost sounds like a drum of sorts. I can't explain it, but don't expect a techno song as in clubbing...you'll just have to listen to the sample!      I genuinely smiled after hearing \\"Alarm Call,\\" it's got a very light and happy message! Bjrk says, \\"I want to go on a mountain-top with a radio and good batteries, play a joyous tune, and free the human race from suffering.\\"      Probably the most energetic and oddly bizarre song of the bunch, \\"Pluto\\" is an intense and noisy song that'll get your pulse going after hearing the rest of the album, which is significantly slower. :) Love it!!!!      This is a very wonderful album because it's a journey through so many different musical landscapes that you'll feel like a genre-saavy person after listening! It's enchanting and entrhalling! BUY IT!!!!
6304077939|4.0|Do not believe the boxcover that portrays this as a delightful comedy about sexual curiosity!  Leolo is much darker than that.<BR>Here we find a gritty life through the eyes of a youngster who happens to be a bit of a magical realist.   Some moments are witty, such as the imagined story of his conception while others are downright awkward and painful.   <BR>  What I liked best about the movie were the several thematic areas it covered in a symbolic and mythical fashion.   It addresses an individual's and family's psychological disintegration, the status of the urban underclass, & sexuality. It also portrays the boy, leolo, as a sort of magical escapist messiah for his hopeless family.  <BR>    Leolo also happens to be one of only two films I have seen where a piece of raw liver is violated. (warning for the squeemish)   If you are in any way prudish, do avoid this film.<BR>   In summary, this is an excellent & deep film for viewing with friends if you care to stimulate a strong discussion.
B000002NIW|5.0|This cd is one of the most solid rock albums you'll ever hear. I still remeber the first day i got it in '98 and I probably listened to it 10 times that day. Every song rules, the weakest are probably 'My Own Summer' and 'Headup.' Everything else is a 10/10. This is by far the best Deftones album. White Pony is pretty good, but the fact they re-released it with 'back to school' on it would make it about a 3 star album. This album is more pure and not intent on giving anyone a hit single.
B00004RF9B|5.0|Probably up until the original Star Wars Trilogy, the best sci-fi movie ever made. A good story line, well acted, and keeps your interest all through the show. Considering when it was made, the effects are well done. Good family entertainment for all ages. For anyone who enjoys good sci-fi without the mind games, this is a must for every collector.
B000026FOA|5.0|This is one of three albums by the best musician, in my opinion, to ever step within this world of confusion, rushing, and absence of relaxation.  Nick Drake may have made this album in the 1960's but the sounds have not aged at all, and will remain forever in my mind as the most beautiful songs ever recorded.  This would go perfect for sitting alone at night, relaxing in light afternoon sun, or watching the hazy colors of a sunset replaced by the black calm of night.  Get this CD, my friend, you will not regret it.
B00004YA0T|5.0|I have just finished listening to the complete cycle for the second time.  This is the Holy Grail of Bruckner Symphonic recordings.  I like it better than the BPO recordings, with him that I used to have.  I have put away all of the other 'favorite' recordings of the symphonies to never to be listened to again,  no matter how sumptious, idyosncratic or whatever.<br />After listening and then reading about Maestro Jochum's growing up with this music and holding it to himself as he would the Bible shows his mastery of these works.  My old criteria was to listen to a performance of the 9th as compared to Bruno Walter's 60's performance done for Columbia/Sony.  Jochum blows him away and the Staatskapelle of Dresden is marvelous.  Maybe not as sumptious as the BPO or PHO, but the brass!!! Oh, the brass!  What wonderful a sound.  Is it the cathedral or the section itself?  Such power and such a beautiful, dark even mysterious sound.  I loved it.<br />If there was a tiny weak spot it had to be the  sixth.  Maybe I just need to listen to it more.  The construction of it seemed to be a little weak.  As I say, it might be just me and I am willing to listen to it until it becomes more familiar to me.  I had thought the fifth to be the 'quirky' one before, but Maestro Jochum brings about a different approach to the themes and juxtaposes them either slow or faster, softer or louder or much more expressive than the other recordings I have.  The result is the most awesome and powerful performance of the lot.<BR>To me, the fifth was his first great symphony and Jochum brings it forth as no other. The seventh, eighth and ninth are also so marvelous to almost be beyond describing.<br />I HAVE JUST ADDED THIS IN!!  WHAT PLANET WAS I ON WHEN I LISTENED TO THE 6TH SYMPHONY THE FIRST TIME!!?  How magnificent!!  This could be the hidden gem in the whole lot! Bruckner was a monumental mover of blocks of music.  That is the only way I can state this.  The magnificent way he uses descendingscales against ascending scales, and they seem to move upward together.  I guess what threw me, the first time, was the melodic construction.  The fifth was a curiosity until I heard the awesome, magnificent recording on this set.  But, hearing the 6th for the third time now I think this is Bruckner's homage to Wagner. I thought I heard praises to the 'Ring' here and the 'Liebestod' in the adagio.  Very beautiful music in this symphony. The finale is the most ecstatic expression, in my mind, of any of the symphonies, yet since I have received this set, these symphonies are the only music I listen to.  His music is so holy, to me.  A man's expression of ultimate love of the Creator (or whatever one calls him/her/energy/spirit-all of the above) and his effort to make universal music grasped by all lovers of deep, spiritual expression in music. His music is, truly, like no other composers' and it is worth the listening and re-listening to ingrain the inner movement it creates.<br />One of the reviewers says that if you have heard one Bruckner Symphony you have heard them all.  That may be true and what we may be hearing is the composer's inexorable movement toward perfection and a cyclic expression of it.  I seem to have heard threads of earlier symphonies in the later compositions, and it seemed to me to be a complete whole expression of them all.  I hope that makes sense.  We know that he was constantly revising his work and it works because his music, as idiosyncratic as it is, develops into a surprisingly coherent whole.<br />Bruckner's music is like no other's.  I think that Sibelius may be the only one to approach the monolithic style of him.  I read, one time, Bruckner's music being compared to other composers and the comment was that other's were composed to bring joy and whatever.  Bruckner's was to move mountains and this set proves it.<br />I recommend this set the highest of any other that I have on this venue before.  An absolute must for any library.  Play it when you want to feel close to God or whoever you believe or worship because it will move your heart and soul.  <br />Maestro Jochum, thank you for moving this humble man to his very heart and soul
B000025XKM|5.0|This has to be the most beautiful album ever created.  I have probably listened to this CD 75 times, in full, since I got it, and every time I am almost put in a trance by the beauty that is Nick Drake's music.  Nick Drake uses differen't tunings for his guitar that sometimes make it sound as if a mini-orchestra is playing on his albums, but is just the sweet, melancholy tunes of a hushed voice singing out lyrics and the strings of a lone guitar slowely winding an environment of peace and serenity around your life, letting you fully relax, and see the beauty in things.  I may sound like a hippy, but this is no exaggeration, you must get this CD now, and cherish it forever, for once you hear these beautiful songs your life will never be the same, it will be better.
0060090383|5.0|I stumbled upon Marian Keye's &quot;Sushi&quot; book as a fluke. I normally do not read anything but suspense and mystery. However, I loved it, so I went out and bought almost every book she has written. I have since read them all and I have to say they are all highly entertaining, but &quot;Rachel's Holiday&quot; is a step above. I adored this book. It made me laugh and cry all at the same time. It's a brilliant portrayal of humanity. It is witty, hilarious and the insight into Rachel's addiction is stunningly real. It is educational without being preachy. On another note, I love reading stories about all these sisters from the same family. Margaret (ANGELS), Claire(WATERMELON) and this one, Rachel. I hope she writes one about the most hilarious sister, Helen. Oh, I also must say this. The way Keyes develops her characters is out of this world. I could touch Simon he was so real. I LOVED him. I never wanted this book to end. She creates such realistic characters that I remember them weeks later like they were real people. I can't rave on enough about this book. It is a must read.
B00008J4P5|1.0|The White Stripes are supposed to be the next big innovating beast in music right?  Well, they may be a beast, but they are not the next big thing, especially in music.  This is because they are completely unable to grasp the concept that music is supposed to be nice to listen to.  While I know that their sound is not for everyone, it isn't music at all.  I have been playing drums and guitar, both for less than a year, and I have more skill than either of them.  It's old, it's boring, it's repetitive.  They can't expect to pass this off as &quot;creativity&quot;, because it's just making up for their lack of skill.  Skill isn't everything, yes, but please, for the love of all that is sacred, make it stop.  <br />Worst<br />Band<br />Ever
B00023BLXK|5.0|OMG!!! Dirty Dancing Havana Nights was the best movie I have seen this year. The Dvd is coming out in like 3 weeks on July 20 I am totally going to buy it! I LOVED IT!!! I saw it 3 times because i loved it so so so so much! I loved how Javier and Katey fell in love it was so cute and perfect but the ending i didn't like because they were going to leave eachother but i liked how they showed it because they didn't just show them leaving eachother they showed them dancing in the club where they first danced La Rosa Negra was it's name.I can't wait to watch it!!!!! I have the soundtrack it has really good music and i also have a poster in my room from the movie. I really suggest that anyone who is reading this should definatly buy Dirty Dancing Havana Nights because it's WAY better than the first one not that i didn't like the first one it was great it's just i thought the 2 one was way better or rent it. IT'S AWESOME AND THE BEST LOVE STORY EVER CREATED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00009RAJH|3.0|I just excitedly purchased this CD (along with Tusk and Rumours), as I am a huge Mac fan. However, I found the remastering to be oddly inconsistent. I was expecting &quot;Warm Ways&quot; to sound senstional, as it was already great on the original CD. However, the remastered verion sounded really dull and flat. Skipping to other tracks though (particularly the second half of the album), I found the remastered version sounded better on most tracks. This is really weird - usually a remaster sounds better or it doesn't; it shouldn't vary from track to track.<br />Has anybody else had the same experience as me? If somebody else could do the same comparison I'd really appreciate it. Perhaps the Australian version (where I bought it) is inferior to the US. It certainly doesn't sound too bright, as another reader here reports. Quite the opposite in fact (but only on some tracks).
015626224X|5.0|This book reads much more like a memoir than the novel it is, and indeed it is a largely autobiographical work. Orwell begins with an anonymous narrator describing daily life in the poorer parts of Paris during the early 1900s. He describes the din, the dirt, the bugs, and all else in vivid detail. The narrator, an Englishman by birth, is living in Paris and running low on funds. We follow him through various attempts to earn money, including work as a lowly dishwasher or &quot;plongeur&quot; in the city's hotels, and also in one dubious restaurant. We learn all the dirty behind-the-scenes secrets of these operations, and it's quite enough to make one's skin crawl and cause one to avoid hotels and restaurants forever.<br />The second half of the book follows the narrator back to his native England, where he must find a way to get by in London while awaiting a permanent job. Here we are introduced to the tramp's way of life - vagrancy, begging, and sleeping in the cheapest (and filthiest) accomodations available. But we also get to know some of the narrator's fellow tramps, and to feel for them. They are not all the worthless, lazy scum that the higher classes of the time would paint them as. Orwell concludes the book with a brief treatise on the vagrant's plight and ways in which it can be eased, as well as making the tramp a usefull part of society.<br />Obviously Orwell's closing call-to-action is not entirely relevant anymore, as the workings of society have changed somewhat over the last century, but the book is nevertheless fascinating. A reader may at first be a little thrown off by the lack of a central plot, but once past this it is easy to get sucked into the world Orwell has illustrated here. His imagery is so striking that you actually feel as if you are sharing the narrator's experiences. You can feel the intense heat of the hotel kitchens, feel the weakness and weariness that comes with malnutrition, smell the grease and the sweat and the dirt.<br />And yet, as bleak as all this sounds, the book is not depressing. The narrator never lapses into dejection or self-pity, and the reader is left with a sense of hope throughout the novel. Being poor is not presented as a dead end - there are always ways to get by, some of them quite ingenious. And the narrator is even able to find humor in some of the truly absurd situations he finds himself in.<br />Any fan of Orwell's works will not be disappointed with this book. Or even if you've read nothing by Orwell (in which case you absolutely must pick up &quot;1984&quot; at some point), and merely want a glimpse into the life of the poor and jobless at this point in history, this is the book for you. And the fact that the narrator is anonymous (although the story is largely based on Orwell's life, the narrator is not, as some reviewers have claimed, Orwell himself) helps us imagine that he could be anyone, and that even we could be living this life. It's fairly short and easy to read, but opens up a whole world - one that is rarely contemplated in much detail - with it's rich descriptions. Definitely a recommended read.yet, as bleak as all this sounds, the book is not depressing.

6305327041|4.0|i love this movie i thought it was quite enjoyable.Tim Roth cracks me up when i watched this(his performance reminded me a lot of charlie chaplin) especially when he just walks and talks its quite strange but it was a great movie that i think any tarintino viewer would enjoy.
B000060MWU|5.0|I'm not an audiophile nor an expert on video quality.  However, I have quite a number of DVD's in my collection and this one plays just as well as any of the others.  Anyone saying otherwise are maybe hoping to generate interest in a new edition of the film on DVD or something, which I certainly wouldn't be against if it contains some nice extras.<br />If you're already a David Lynch fan then I won't preach to the choir because you already must love this film.  However, if you're new to Lynch's work, you must not expect anything 'normal' to happen.  He usually breaks the rules of linear story-telling.  This effort is no exception.  The film, according to one theory, is one man's nightmare dreamt from inside the cell of a penitentiary, but it is time displaced and characters switch roles.  The nightmare is based on what we can only assume is real events that involve the main character murdering a young woman whom he loves, but who is tied to a nefarious character named Mr. Eddy.  It's hard to tell who Lynch sees as the real villain here - Mr. Eddy or the girl.  <br />Knowing the dream/nightmare premise, though, you can stop wondering what's going on and just enjoy the ride.  If you're of the Freudian psychoanalysis school of though there will be a lot to keep you focused.  If not, there's still enough linear filmmaking here to keep you enthralled as in a 'normal' movie, but there's enough strange weirdness (Robert Blake's character for instance) that tips you off that this is all a really wacked out nightmare.  The fact that it is probably based on actual events that the main character is remembering in the dream makes it all the more chilling.
B000008GEF|5.0|&quot;Living in the material world&quot; is his best work, since the masterpiece &quot;All things must pass&quot;. Features the track &quot;Give me love (ive me peace on Earth)&quot;, which is one of his best songs of all-time. In fact, every sng is a must listen. &quot;Dont let me wait too long&quot; is another excellent song, with a delectable acoustic rhythm guitar and a great beat. Therefore, buy this album as you as you can, Im sure you wont regret it!<BR>Thanks for reading again.
B000000OQF|5.0|This album kicks a** dudes. I prefer the slower version of &quot; You're crazy&quot; on LIES better.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|Unclear motivations and poor pacing make this a disappointment. Whatever was the Academy thinking when they gave a Best Screenplay to this film? Turn on the subtitles or you'll miss some of the dialogue that's made so subtle in the audio mix that you really can't hear it. The proufound alienation and artificiality of the characters is mirrored in the treatment of Japanese society. In the end, there's nobody in this movie to care about or even to like.
B00005JLSE|5.0|You don't have to be a fan of musicals to enjoy this film.  Its no wonder that this movie won the Academy Award for Best Picture. The talent in this film is amazing.  Who would have thought Richard Gere could dance like that! The dancing is incredible, the singing is just as amazing!  The all-star cast all deserved Oscars! Go and buy the soundtrack you'll love singing on your way to work or to school.  Amazing film!  Take note: Definately not suitable for young kids, even if they did dance to it at dance class!
B00023BLXK|4.0|I absolutely love cuba. especially old havana. it is gorgous.  i loved this movie not only because he's hot, and he can dance like no other. but i thought it had a semi good plot, contrary to what i thought it would be like when i went into the theatre. most movies that are semi remakes of older movies just dont catch my attention. but i absolutely LOVED this one.
B00009V7RF|4.0|Until the '90s, rap was full of glamorous, fun-filled lyrics and beats that made you feel like gettin' up and shakin' that thang. But after that, gangsta rap emerged as the dominant rap style, filled with bleak, sonically detailed lyrics and productions.<BR>But in 2003, the Black Eyed Peas, along with OutKast, came back, and their music dominated the airawves that were currently being dominated by punk, goth rock, and gangsta rap, particularly 50 Cent, and the pathetic punk group, Good Charlotte. The Black Eyed Peas brought their own unique funkadelic-like sound to hip-hop. It took us back to the golden age, with breakdancing, club beats, and simpler productions. A whole new era of hip-hop fans were introduced to this type of rap through OutKast and BEP.<BR>Now let's gets to the album. Almost every song is perfect, and this is thouroughly helped by the group's new member, Fergie. She doesn't rap, but she adds a great funk type sound to every track. The album is wonderful because the BEP's are funky, and their music is littered with positive messages, everything from anti-war songs (Where is the Love) to club beats (Hey Mama/Let's Get Retarded.) My favorite track would be Let's get Retarded because of its usage during the 2004 playoff season for the NBA. But the most popular song is Where Is The Love? Because of its great message and mind-blowing content. The song mostly aims at anti-war and peace throughout the world. It might just leave a tear in your eye. Hey Mama is the third-best track. It's funky, psychedelic, and it is just pure joy to listen to. The other songs add to the album as well, and they are all terrific. For a funky good time, you should check out Elephunk, The Black Eyed peas' new album. (My recommendation would be to get the CD with the bonus track, Let's Get it Started. It is just an edit of Let's Get retarded, but being such as basketfall fan, I like it more than its original title.)
B0000DD7LB|5.0|MAN.  You just gotta LISTON!!!  this is so awesome.  plain and simple.  it just gets me in the mood to dance, espceilaly with my dog.  sometimes we even get a little kissing action goin on.  some ppl say im weird by kissing my dog, but with this music it seems wonderful.  toxic is so cool, along with all da other tracks, its kinda romantic...when my boyfriend comes over i always play this, but my dog is more enjoyable.  i dont care if ppl think that brittney spears is bad, cuz shes good.
B00008EY65|4.0|it was a good movie but it was a little skippy, it would have been better if they made it into two movies so that the story could be played out better. go rent it and you'll probably agree!
B00002SSKI|3.0|In this film four women get together to celebrate the upcoming birth of a new baby and start reminiscing the last summer of thier 'childhood'. In the summer of 1970, the four girls explore the death of a young boy, that died years before they were born.  The girls learn more about themselves then anything else.  Great performances by the young stars. This is the perfect movie for slumber parties, as long as there is some Kleenex around! This 'coming of age' film is excellent.  It makes you really appreciate the friendships that you have, at any age, and that there is nothing better than your own 'girlfriends'! Great film for 'mother and daughter time' for those girls 10 and up!

B000084T18|1.0|This is garbage. I wish he would of died trying because that story would make him more &quot;legendary&quot; than his feeble attempts at boasting himself. &quot;Ooooohhh you got shot&quot; Big deal. Any dumbass can get shot. Don't make you special. As a matter of fact it is depressing when people compare him to the likes of the revolutionary 2pac. No where near the power of 2Pac. This isn't true hip hop in the sense that it is all about &quot;the club&quot; and constantly gett'n crunk with dumb ho's. That ain't real life. That isn't the struggle of making it. That is already made pure and simple. This album and the G-Unit album &quot;Beg for Mercy&quot; (Trust me Banks, 50 and that cash-money floozie, I am begging for mercy because it is hard to turn on the T.V and not hear your crap brand of Hip Pop) are just club songs. That's it. No truth, no skill and tinkerbell-ass beats. Enjoy it and consume it America. You love this crap.
B00006GFAB|4.0|This is a decent schmattering of songs from a 30+ year career. 21 songs on 1 disc just isn't enough tho. On the flip side, the 5-disc box set is probably way too much for the average KISS fan. 17 of the songs here are from the 1970's alone - thus indicating the bands best work is well behind them. Too many compilations (8?) have been made for/by KISS for anyone to really care about which one is the best. Based on this \\"Very Best Of Kiss\\" single disc release and it's 21 songs, I will give you my \\"Ultimate KISS Collection\\" on 2 cd's (42 total songs).

B000089RVX|5.0|I've been an Evanescence fan ever since I heard 'Bring Me To Life' on the radio early last year and I've been listening to 'Fallen' non-stop since I bought it back in April last year. But, I will admit, it took a little time for this album to grow on me. The first time I heard it, I liked it and I thought it was alright, though I thought some of the songs sounded alike. But after a few more listens, I woke up and realized that this album was more than 'Bring me to life' and 'going under'. Songs like 'Tourniquet', 'Haunted' and 'Imaginary' truly show their talents, not just the singles. Amy's voice is amazing and even more than a year later, it never gets old to listen to. The melodies are gorgeous and the guitars are outstanding and the piano ballads are amazing. This album is great and deserves a full listen. Don't just judge them by the singles.
B00009MGGI|5.0|British TV is famous for many things--Monty Python, Fawlty Towers, Yes (Prime) Minister, I, Claudius and so on. This incomparable trilogy deserves a seat in the front row of best Britain has produced--well written and acted, witty dialogue and a good pace in story development. The seamless delivery of black humor and drama make this series worth purchasing. The story lines are prescient, and Ian Richardson's &quot;FU&quot; is sinister yet human, and watching him transform from one form of ogre to another is addictive.
B000002GK1|5.0|Man im only 19, so when this album came out i was like 7 or 8, this cd was played daily in my house, i remember playin air guitar and headbanging to this cd. I loved this cd when i was 8 and i love it now. Definately Soundgardens best cd and in my opinion one of the best albums of the 90s no matter what genre.
B00008GKEG|5.0|A TV special.  Three double albums.  An eight video set.  One place to find the Beatles' entire musical history.  Told through ten hours of present day interviews and totally new footage, this documentary IS the Beatles.  Travel around the world with the Beatles and see them in concert at such locations as London, Australia, Sweeden, Japan, and of course, America.  This five-DVD set contains highlights of the Beatles' performances from all around the world, plus newsreels, home movies, movie clips, interviews and more!  Everything you need of the Beatles all in one place.  Amazing.
B00008OWZC|5.0|No comparison. \\"How The West Was Won\\" released by Atlantic in 2002 puts \\"The Song Remains The Same\\" (1976) to shame. Page, Plant, Jones & Bonham are all in top form.<br />WHAT YOU GET: 17 songs on 3 discs - that probably could have fit on 2 discs - recorded in 1972 from shows at California's LA Forum and Long Beach Arena. OK - there are really 18 tracks listed, but I'm not including the 14 second waste of an opening track \\"LA Drone\\". 17 songs compared to \\"Ths Song Remains The Same\\" and it's 9 tracks. Better, tho not superior sound quality (remember this is 1972). Great song selection tho I must say that only one song (\\"Dazed & Confused\\") is featured from Led Zep's brilliant 1st album; 5 songs from Led Zep II; 4 songs from Led Zep III; 4 songs from Led Zep IV; and tho not released yet, 3 songs (\\"The Ocean\\", \\"Over The Hills & Far Away\\" and \\"Dancing Days\\") are featured from their soon to be released \\"Houses Of The Holy\\". Anyone else notice how quiet the audience was after these songs ended? You get 4 marathon songs with \\"Moby Dick\\", \\"Whole Lotta Love\\", \\"Bring It On Home\\" and \\"Dazed & Confused\\"... each containing some medleys within (assorted early rock covers, blues, and a small taste of \\"The Crunge\\").<br />WHAT YOU DON'T GET: No expansive liner notes (what they give you is the bare minimum here), no history or roots of the band, no booklet with cool pictures. The song selection is top notch, but for me personally I miss some of the stuff from Zep's debut (even the really short songs like \\"Good Times Bad Times\\", or \\"Communication Breakdown\\" would have been cool), as well as from Zep's second \\"Ramble On\\" or \\"Thank you\\". The ONLY song I miss from \\"The Song Remains The Same\\" is \\"Celebration Day\\" - this was probably my favorite song from this one.<br />Overall a great recording and a definite must-buy for even the slightest of Led Zeppelin fans and any rock & roll fan who grew up in the 1970's. Essential? Hell yes.
B000069AUI|3.0|I  finally purchaed this CD.  The playing is really good and elegent.  Starts off strong. &quot;The Scientist' &amp; &quot; Clocks&quot; are especially good.  Quality drops off towards the end off CD and gets boring.  Just may be too tasteful and antiseptic for own good.
0385504209|3.0|Dan Brown's runaway bestseller, The Da Vinci Code, has an interesting premise.  It goes into the story about an underground society, the Priory of Scion, whose sole purpose is to keep the true meaning of the Holy Grail secret until it is time to reveal it to the world.  The story unfolds over basically one night in Paris.  Robert Langdon is a Harvard professor of symbology and is in Paris giving a lecture.  He is awoke in his hotel room and escorted to the Louvre as a well-known art curator, Jacques Sauriene has been murdered.  While at the Louvre he is met by Captain Bezu Fache who interrogates him and a cryptologist Sophie Nouveu who gives him a bizarre message.  It turns out that Langdon is the prime suspect in the murder and Sophie helps him escape.  It turns out she is Sauriene's granddaughter.  Throughout the night they elude the French police and go to an old acquaintance of Langdon, Leigh Teabing, for refuge.  Teabing is an excentrict Englishman living in France who is also one of the world foremost expert on the Grail.  Meanwhile, a strict religious sect, Opus Dei, is also in search of the Grail as well.  Eventually Langdon and Sophie put together all the pieces of the puzzle and Sophie's true identity is revealed to her.  The most interesting part of the book is the history of the Grail itself.  Whether you believe the story or not (most of it has been refuted and is hard to believe to be actually true), the story is very intriguing.  Explaining clues from Da Vinci paintings and the history of the Gospels makes for great reading.  Unfortunately, the story in between the lessons is weak.  Mr. Brown creates some very implausible situations and the true motives of Teabing are totally unbelievable and contrived. The plot and elaborate setup that Teabing constructs has absolutely no plausibility and could never be carried out, even by the most devious and creative minds.  That lacks of believability definitely hurts the story, but all the Grail information makes up for the huge plot holes.s up for the huge plot holes.
0316168815|3.0|I loved this book in the beginning! It seemed promising and authentic. It was written from a unique perspective. A girl who was murdered watches from heaven as her family, friends,  law officials, and murderer all deal with the tragedy and move on with their lives.<br /> I found the heaven that she was in to be a bit uninspired and surprisingly secular. A little too secular if you ask me. It was almost as if the author was trying desperately not to offend anyone who might read it. There is no mention of God anywhere in the book. Which makes the author's presumption of after-life slightly curious and almost naive. However, heaven was not the main focus as she mostly watched the activity on earth. This much was very heart warming and real. <br /> Then all of the sudden there is this entirely incompatible scene where susie \\"drops down to earth\\" and takes over another girl's body. HUH? This was highly inconsistant with the rest of the story. And THEN when she has taken over this girl's body, you would think that she would use that time to show people where to find her killer, or at least her remains so that she might help to prevent other young girls from being killed or to bring closure to her family. Instead she takes this opportunity to have sex?? HUH? Not to mention that when she died she was a young teenage girl who had just been brutaly raped.  AHHH! <br /> I wanted so much for the book to end with as much genuine fervency as the beginning had. But all in all the ending was quite peculiar and frustrating.  I am glad I read it however and I will look for future books by this author.
B0002858YS|5.0|I recently bought this album and i love it.  It is a great all around album.  It has all kind of songs whether they be fast and upbeat or slower and more mellow.  It is a great cd and worth the money you will pay for it.
0446310786|5.0|I was forced to read this book in High School and they nearly killed it for me. It's hard to take single book and spend several weeks on it and drag out very niggly detail ad nausum. So I understand why all these high school students rate it so poorly. But recently I picked up my kids copy and re-read it. And lo and behold its full of life treasures. Treat your neighbors with respect and dignity. Color of your skin doesn't equate to your worth. On the otherhand the black folks described in this book are all hard working but poor good people, except for one slightly obnoxious person that the kids meet in church. Note though the story is told from the perspective of a young white middle class kid who would not have had much contact except through the help and so the characterizations all fit true to form.<br />So read it for what it is, and when it was written and don't judge it by what you know now. In '61 life was still pretty segregated in the South and so this was a very radical book.<br />For modern readers, Atticus role as a parent was decades ahead of its time. In the 00's you'll find fathers with this outlook but in the 60's it was very rare. One can explain this from the stoies perspective because Atticus wife's death forced him to change.<br />Anyway I like this book a lot. It's right up there with Faulkner's Light in the Forest.
B000003S09|5.0|I first listened to this as a 15-year-old in 1984. I hated the pop out at the time-Wham and Culture Club-and knew about the Beatles and Stones and Kinks. But I had no idea that there was such as thing as &quot;Progressive&quot; or &quot;Underground&quot; music.<br />When I heard &quot;Schizoid Man,&quot; it scared the bejeaus out of me. Yet I understood the jazzy impulse, and understood for the  first time there were gneres beyond &quot;pop&quot; and &quot;rock.&quot; I shyed away, while still playing the track every chance I got.<br />I still listen to this album often, not only for deep love for the music on it, but for all it taught me about music. This record lead me to John Coltrane, Bark Psychosis, and, litterally, 1000s of other artists. My whole record collection-10,000 rock, jazz and classical albums-leads straight back to hearing this record. If I am listening to Terry Riley, Miles Davis, Acid Mothers Temple, Sonny Sharock, Sonic Youth or Brian Wilson's Smile Sessions, it all leads back to the impact this record had on me 20 years ago.<br />&quot;21st Century Schizod Man&quot; takes all the experiments &quot;underground&quot; bands were conduting at the time and blows them away in seven minutes. It was litterally-when the album came out in 1969- the hardest rock that had been recorded.  Modern hard rock bands are still striving for this type of impact, but don't understand music well enough to even touch this tower.<br />&quot;I Talk to The Wind&quot; is a jazz-folk ballad. Brillant on its own terms with its flute and cloudy melotron, it is were the Beatles might have gone if they had the will. &quot;Moonchild&quot; is the Moody Blues meets free jazz. It takes the best elements of the latter, and is far more daring than anything the Moodys ever did.<br />&quot;Epataph&quot; and the title track are more conservitive. They are, perhaps, better-produced copies of Moodys concepts. Yet even here, Michael Giles drumming and Robert Fripp's sustain guitar are aboslutely shots fired at the start of a revolution. The Police and the Talking Heads spent their careers working out the possitilities King Crimson presented on this album.<br />If you want to understand the jazz of the 50s and 60s or the art-rock of the 70s and 80s, start with this album. Be ready, this is not only the trip, it is the ticket. Listen to it as if young and naked, ready to be turned on to a new world.<br />If ready, you won't be the same after hearing &quot;In The Court Of The Crimson King.&quot;slutely shots fired at the start of a revolution.

1592400876|5.0|I think many reviewers have missed the point of this book (in addition to not reading the publisher's note acknowledging differences in British and American punctuation).  I am annoyed every day by the horrific punctuation I see, and I'm just glad to know that I'm not the only one.  I bought this as a joke for my husband for Father's Day (he is not the greatest at grammar, punctuation, or spelling, but he has many redeeming qualities), but I really bought it for myself, because I knew I would enjoy it; and I have, immensely.  Cheers to Lynne Truss!
B0001I55OC|2.0|This movie wasn't a total waste of time, but it didn't do justice to the book either.  My husband and I were both riveted by the book, so we rented the movie.  It glossed over so much of the fascinating beginning of the book, and simplified so much within the book, that we were left with a bare-bones story.  Bare-bones was just not very entertaining.  Michael Crichton should be more careful about signing away movie rights!
B00018D44U|2.0|Her first CD was calming, sweet, jazzy, and nostalgic.  I listed to \\"Come Away with Me\\" too much, but I still like it.  So, I was excited to get her new CD.  It's terrible; there's not a song I like on there. I still listen to her first CD; her second CD is lost somewhere.
B00005YW4H|5.0|Not-quite-jazz, not-quite-blues CD it is unlike anything I've heard in a long, long time. The soothing melodies, jazz chords, and lyrics make this an album that manages to combine everything wonderful about life into one CD. &quot;Come away with me,&quot; is my favorite.
0767805712|5.0|1997's science-fiction drama GATTACA offers an intelligent look into the possible future of applied DNA science, a future where potential parents are given the ability to determine the genetic characteristics and thereby create a society of near-perfect super-humans.  As one might deduce, this means that individuals born the \\"natural way\\"--such folk are referred to as \\"In-Valids\\"--are deemed inferior and prejudicially relegated to the lower rungs of the social ladder.  In other words, In-Valids are considered mere mortals in this high-tech, genetically engineered world, and as such, education and opportunity are socially beyond their reach.<br />The film's plot revolves around Vincent Freeman (Ethan Hawke), an In-Valid who works as a janitor at an aerospace firm named Gattaca Corporation.  But in spite of society's view of him, Vincent has dreams of someday going into space himself, and his intelligence and all-consuming drive to find a way to transcend societally imposed barriers leads him into an alliance with a black-marketeer (Tony Shalhoub) and a genetically \\"superior\\" young man (Jude Law) who wants to sell his own identity.  Soon Vincent is engaged in a scheme to secure employment as an engineer at Gattaca and thereby realize his goals and dreams.  But once he's finally on the other side of the fence, how long can he sustain such subterfuge in a society where an individual's genetic identity is constantly monitored and even a lost eyelash can provide authorities with enough genetic material to expose a fraud?<br />GATTACA examines the nature of personal identity, personal destiny, and the idea that an individual can become more than the sum of his parts.  Aldous Huxley's BRAVE NEW WORLD already thoroughly covers these same themes, but GATTACA approaches them in a more earnest and less satirical manner than does Huxley's magnum opus.  GATTACA is therefore a very literate piece of speculative SF that should appeal to those who desire more than the standard STAR WARS (1977) or bug-eyed alien fare.  Unfortunately, the film is a bit too cerebral for the average filmgoer, and probably explains why GATTACA was a bit of a bomb at the box office.<br />The film is excellently scripted and directed by Andrew Niccol, who later penned the script for the acclaimed THE TRUMAN SHOW (1998).  The all-star cast does a fantastic job of acting, too, even those in minor roles (watch for Ernest Borgnine, Gore Vidal, Xander Berkeley, and others).  Slawomir Idziak's cinematography is gorgeous but never overwhelms the story, and the special FX, though minimal, are subtle and quite effective.  GATTACA is a great example of what thoughtful, intelligent SF cinema should be.<br />The standard DVD version of GATTACA from Columbia/Tristar offers a very good digital transfer of the film (there are a few filmic artifacts) in 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen.  It also has bonus material that includes a short featurette, trailers, and some deleted scenes.  The SuperBit DVD version--also in 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen--offers a crisper, less grainy digital transfer, but it was apparently made from the same source and therefore contains the same filmic artifacts.  (Audiophiles note: the SuperBit does have superior sound.)  Keep in mind that, as with other SuperBit offerings from Columbia/Tristar, the increased bit rate comes at the cost of bonus material--you get the film only.  And the higher cost of the SuperBit is justifiable only if you have a high-definition TV and can therefore appreciate the extra visual info.  Regardless of which DVD version is purchased, however, a GATTACA DVD is a must-own for any true fan of intelligent speculative science fiction.WARS (1977) or bug-eyed alien fare.

0743455967|3.0|King's book divides into two parts.  The first section is a memoir of his writing and the second section is full of writing tips.<br />The first section begins with King's childhood writings and works its way into his adulthood as a clothes washer, teacher and struggling writer.  When King finally sells his first novel Carrie you want to put the book down and applaud.<br />Even with that great ending, I tend to like the second part a little better.  You learn that King hates adverbs and it was hard for him to write a nonfiction book.  It must have been tough, because the book doesn't really have a central focus.  He makes up for it though with a great writing style and sense of humor.<br />An interesting tidbit is that his famous accident happened in the middle of writing this.  So you also get the story of the accident along with everything else.  How many authors could write with such humor and grace as they described their own mangling?<br />I've never read Stephen King's fiction because I don't really like that genre.  Reading his smooth style here makes me think I will give one a chance at some point.  I can see why he sells so many books.

B00004W52U|4.0|Operation Ivy takes a lot of heat for spawning Rancid (a pale imitation of The Clash) and a huge crapfest of awful bands who played pop-punk with horns. However, the &quot;ska&quot; label was somewhat overstated for this band, especially since only one or two songs on Energy actually feature horns (Bad Town is the only one I can recall). And these guys were miles ahead of their imitators in every conceivable way.<br />What Op Ivy really did back in 1988-89 was combine punk, ska, and reggae (with a little hardcore edge thrown in), and record the whole mess nice and lo-fi--original and totally excellent stuff. Blink-182 and Sum41 fans will cringe at the DIY-level sound quality and Jesse Michaels' untrained voice, but I wouldn't trade Energy for any of their Pro Tools-smothered junk. THIS is punk. Overproduction need not apply.<br />With 27 tracks, each averaging about 2 minutes, Energy has the punk energy down pat. Tim Armstrong (&quot;Lint&quot;) lays down great speedy hyper-ska guitar lines all over the place, and Matt McCall is probably one of the few punk bassists who isn't totally incompetent (am I hearing some slap bass?). The album is chock full of melodies, catchy choruses, surprisingly sophisticated lyrics (especially considering that these guys were merely teenagers at the time), and plenty of groove. At least half of these songs are worthy of becoming standards--the opener Knowledge (Green Day covered it early on, but the original is superior), Sound System, Take Warning (my favorite), The Crowd, Bad Town, Freeze Up..I could go on and on.<br />Forget the &quot;ska-punk&quot; label--ultimately this is excellent non-hyphenated punk rock, and it should be in your collection.
0783228007|3.0|I really wanted to like this film a lot: what with Clint and Robert Duvall starring together.<br />But it's just not a very good film. It has the flavor of classic Clint and the western drama but lacks the substance. The story line is too improbable for even the most ardent fan. The dialogue and action are slow and drawn out. Like molasses.<br />And the climax is just plain limp.<br />Fortunately, there are so many great Clint westerns to choose from - Hang'em High, Good, Bad, and the Ugly trio, The Outlaw Josey Wales (one of Clint's favorites) that the viewer can still enjoy wonderful westerns of the highest quality - but this isn't one of them.<br />Three stars.
0142437611|1.0|I was forced to read this book in English 201 (Sophomore College Class) and HATED it! I had to write a paper too, I got an A but only because I told the TRUTH of this book! The main character who calls himself Tommy Wilhelm is immature, unthinking and incredibly selfish. He's addicted to pain-killer medication, never washes his hands and is balding, fat and separated from his wife. We find out at the beginning of the book that Tommy is living in an old-folks retirement home in New York City even though he is only in his 40's. Tommy just lost his job at a children's furniture factory. His wife and son live in New York but he won't live with them. Tommy is down to his last few hundred dollars and has foolishly invested them in the stock market on the advice of Dr. Tamkin, a lying, cheating, vulture-like oldster with unclean personal habits.<br />In the course of the book, we find that Tommy's real name is actually Wilhelm Adler but he changed his name because he wanted to start a Hollywood career. Tommy makes all the wrong decisions before he finds the right one, and he follows many stupid whims and the advice of anyone who knows how to flatter him, he never stops to consider common sense. He also believes wild stories from Dr. Tamkin, who probably isn't a doctor at all judging from his actions. Tommy's juvenile tendencies are reinforced in many ways. First, his name: Tommy is a name for little boys, upon reaching maturity men are called Tom or Thomas, not the diminuative Tommy. Second: His father still calls him Wilky, a hated nickname from childhood. This is his father's way of letting Tommy know that he still acts like a child. Third: Tommy expects his father to pay his rent for him, even though he is 40-some years old! Fourth: The fact that he lives in the same building as his father even though he despises the old man, it's as if he can't break his ties from Daddy.<br />There are many water symbols in this book, allusions to baptism and rebirth, symbols of what Tommy needs to do for himself. Also allusions to death and corpses, which are a symbol of what Tommy is falling in to. Throughout, we see Tommy slowly spiral downwards in pills, depression, doubt and stupidity until he hits rock-bottom. We learn about his life prior to this point and the affair he had with a Catholic girl in another town.<br />My professor was a very good instructor, but he must have really had a synical side to him in order to enjoy this book so much! To let you know, my paper was actually a LOT better than this review but I hated this book so much that I just don't have the energy to actually use my talents on this book one more time! This is just my plea to you, DO NOT READ THIS BOOK!!! Not unless you are a hopeless manic/depressive with no hope to your life!Tommy needs to do for himself.

B000001FA4|5.0|Most of the songs on this recording still have passion and deep meaning, yet the signature U2 sound of early days is left behind. I enjoy the departure from the anthems and marches we have gotten used to in the past. The Eno influence is noticeable and provides a new direction for the band. Different melodies are experimented with and work very well.
B00008H2LB|5.0|Linkin Park is an unusual band.  They are easily classified as &quot;radio friendly&quot; to appeal to everyone and have a good set of rare tracks and such to create strong linkin park fans.  It's hard to fall in love with a band if you don't know what they sounded like years ago or before they were signed.  <br />Linkin Park is the perfect &quot;pop&quot; band.  I use the word in quotes because they are not pop.  I think of them as original,  talented, and hard working musicians.  This cd proves that.  Every song can the specifications required for a single and is good enough to be a single.<br />I got two meaningless problems with it: the fact that every song is radio friendly, with a track time average of around 3:02. I do have a problem with them making Numb as a single.  When i first got the cd the last track tied it up for me because it is emotional and a great cd-ender song.  Hearing it played out on the radio ruins the emotion of it.  <br />In all it's perfectness it's still a great cd regardless of the small errors.  You can't go wrong with Linkin Park, thier sound is contageous and the few that do not like thier stlyle, just haven't given in and accepted the fact that yes, they are that good.

B000005AYM|3.0|i love badu's voice, i love the music, but i cannot stomach how her lyrics convey such cynicism and bitterness.  listening to &quot;lifetime&quot; makes me utterly depressed that this woman in her lyrics cannot hope that she can get the man she wants in her present lifetime, perhaps a bit later than sooner.  the lyrics in &quot;certainly&quot; give me the impression that badu deliberately preaches that alienation is her life script.  has she gone through horrible relationships which reflect in her lyrics?  again, i love her voice; billie holiday's sensuality comes to mind when i listen to this CD.  the music is amazing; jazzy, soulful, smooth, and entralling.  i'm not saying that erykah should sing about all things hunky-dory, but enough with the cynicism.
B000003S5H|4.0|Moon Safari is simply amazing! I bought this CD about one year ago, and it is still one of my favorites. It's the type of album you can put on repeat, and never get tired of it. Air's &quot;Moon Safari&quot; offers an eclectic mix of songs that are completely different from one another, but flow well nicely from track to track. Listen to it just for the sake of listening to it, play it at a party - this is versatile. My friends gave it a listen, and they (all with many different musical tastes, might I add) all loved it. &quot;Moon Safari&quot; remains classic and modern at the same time. Completely mellow, with substance.
B0001ADAVK|5.0|I truly enjoyed this film. I'm not a huge Julia Roberts fan but have nothing against her and I truly felt she stretched and was a shining star in this portrayal of a Bohemian teacher in a too-too sophisticated world. Her character was very real, not at all over the top and not at all suggesting a male-bashing sentiment.<br />I keep thinking of her first day in class when the students proved they were more sophisticated and educated than she had anticipated. What a challenge! But her character rises to the occasion and she indeed changed a few lives.<br />Very, very good film. Thank you.
B00000FCBC|3.0|If you are a longtime fan of Metallica im sure you've already heard some of the songs on disk two.  It is disk one im worried about.  It seems im not the only one either, i've seen alot of terrible reviews for disk one.  Yes it is true, disk one lacks inspiration making the covers dull and boring.  Just look at the track list and compare it to disk two. If you like Metallica and don't have the b-sides on disk two then I reccomend this.  If you happen to have these somewhat rare gems then pass this by and never look back.
B00029LNHS|5.0|buy this cd now. it is awesome. i have no more 2 say.
B000002N2Z|5.0|WWOOWW... this is pretty awesome. The thing with deftones is that they dont really have a set genre... In my opinion they sound EMo CORE... they borrow styles from Tool, Weezer, Fugazi, and the later Bad Brains. They even have a little punk influence as well. You can't really label this band nu metal. WOW just because they have heavy riffs and some what slow beats they're automatically labeled nu metal. Thats really not the case. and whatever label it what you want. But this CD is very very amazing. Chino's vocals sound the most pure in this album. every deftones cd pretty much rocks. GET THIS ALBUM!!!!!!!

B00005OAIE|4.0|I didn't exactly write John Mayer off from day one, but when I first heard &quot;No Such Thing,&quot; I really did not like it. But then came &quot;Your Body Is A Wonderland&quot; and the wonderful &quot;Why Georgia,&quot; and I just had to buy this CD. I was not disappointed at all. John Mayer is a fresh addition to current mainstream music, one with a natural ear for melody and one who obviously takes his craft very seriously, having attended a prestigious music school and having become one of the best young guitarists out there. <br />This CD is a joy to listen to. &quot;No Such Thing,&quot; while still not my favorite by far, is a great way to start it off, with the flippant line &quot;Welcome to the real world she said to me, condescendingly,&quot; setting the tone for the rest of Mayer's tongue-in-cheek lyrics. Then comes &quot;Why Georgia,&quot; a song that has a great melody and great lyrics. Since I'm from Georgia, the line &quot;I am driving up 85 . . .&quot;, a reference to metro Atlanta, is one of my favorites on the album. The rest of the album flows in a similar vein to the first two tracks, though the CD never gets monotonous and boring. Of the remaining 11 tracks, the standouts are &quot;My Stupid Mouth,&quot; &quot;83,&quot; &quot;Love Song For No One,&quot; and &quot;Back to You.&quot; These songs should convince anyone of John Mayer's talent.<br />This CD is highly recommended for anyone who is sick of Britney Spears, Justin Timberlake, 50 Cent, etc. John Mayer is a truly gifted artist whose music is substantial, and if this CD and &quot;Heavier Things,&quot; his sophomore effort, are any indication, he'll be around giving us great music for a long time to come.
B00028HBKC|5.0|The Passion of the Christ was something that really interested me. I am a Christian, Baptist to be exact, and I know the story of Jesus' crucifixion pretty well. So, when I heard about this movie, I immediately looked up everything I could about it. This just served to get me more excited to see this movie! We got to the theater, and I was feeling a bit uneasy, even though I'm a Christian, and I knew what was coming. So, I settled in with a Sprite, and completely forgot it was there after the movie started! I ended up crying at the start of the movie before anything major even happened! One scene in particular that was extremely moving for me, was the scene where Jesus is flogged. How, he had the courage to stand up again after being beaten like that is beyond me! If you don't know anything about a Roman flogging in those times, watch this movie and you'll see just how brutal they were. I cannot wait until this movie comes out on Aug. 31, as I will be getting that day. A word of caution though, please, if you watch this, do so with an open mind, and be willing to be changed! Also, if you are squeamish, I would recommend not eating beforehand.
B00008NG5V|3.0|when jack johnson's audience turned the corner from cult surfing followers to AAA radio america, he didn't change anything and that, right there is a positive.  regardless of genre, whenever that corner gets turned on its preverbial head, the music changes - mostly for a poppier and more horid direction.  so congrats to jj for staying away from the trap.  however, just because he stayed away from the trap, does not validate the critical calls of &quot;classic!&quot;<br />cries of deep lyrics are pseudo back handed.  when compared to many of his contemporaries, songs like &quot;cookie jar&quot; may hold some weight, but overall this album still enduces those frat boy party mentalities.  which, in all honesty, is the audience around the corner - doing a keg stand.  it still remains that the height of lyricism remains from the hungry unknowns.  if the minimalistic acoustic driven rock is your fancy and you need some lyrics worth a second thought, my you might want to check out Blue-Eyed Son's &quot;West of Lincoln.&quot;  i heard &quot;The Tide&quot; on a local college station and at first was appauled that his voice reminded me so much of Elliott Smith, but all was soon forgotten with the catchy hooks and wonderful melodies.  i broke down and bought the CD and was happy.  And if you're reading this review, you might want to think of turning another artist's corner - or at the very least, checking it out.<br />there are positives to say about mr. johnson.  sure, you throw it on at a party and the guy pouring the shots at the ice luge might hit you with a double b/c of his fascination with this surfing/acoustic ape of an artist.  but please, don't fool yourself into thinking that this is some of the greatest song writing of the last century, its not even the best over the past five years.
0618526412|1.0|This book was very hard to get into. I didn't like the way the story jumped from one character to another. It was like the author's mind was all over the place when she wrote it.

B0002234LS|4.0|'Secret Window' definitely had me on the edge of my seat for most of the movie. It is filled with suspense and crazy plot turns. However, I found it to be rather cliche, in the sense that it was a total stereotype of a Steven King novel, even though that is what it was based upon. Or maybe not a stereotipical King plot, but almost a cliche 'scarey movie' line, where it's just an easy escape to have the main character be, well, crazy.<br />Despite these vices, 'Secret Window' was still a rather good thriller, and I would recommend it, most definitely. Johnny Depp shines, as usual, and I've never seen him in such a creepy role.<br />Overall: four stars!
B00003CXB2|5.0|This is simply , a towering movie. Just a few films show with so splendor the epical sense as this one. Not only it established a standard as the best work filmed in  the desert: the kinetic existence of this well educated man who fights in a conflict absolutely out his concerns . It's impossible not remind to Lord Byron when he died in Greece , fighting by a noble cause.<br />All the cast was incredible. Alec Guiness , Omar Shariff, Anthony Quinn , Jack Hawkins and Claude Rains and obviously this legendary actor Peter O'Toole who lost the prize as best actor in 1962 with Gregory Peck in To kill a mockingbird.<br />David Lean adapted the book the seven pillars of wisdom with overwhelming results.<br />Lensed in Jordan and Spain , the film has countless astonishing sequences , but I 'd really wanted to underline , just ywo of them.<br />When the army has crossed the Akaba desert , there's a man who apparently fell from the camel. Lawrence decides go bacj for him : and then he listen the warning : you won't get back from the journey don't challenge the destiny . Obviously Lawrence ignores the warning and goes for him . When he arrives with the half dead man , he states those brilliant lines: the destiny is just right here and he touches his head.<br />The other scene is just the opening sequence when he crashs his motocycle and dies in an absurd accident.<br />The hero's life doesn't have any sense after the the triumph of the last battle. Something similar happens with Gladiator &gt;<br />I can't imagine the hero thinking in quiet life or a normal life as the rest of the human being . The hero has completed his mission , has completed his own cycle and the time comes for him to fade . This mythical cycle makes the death of Lawrence,has been more than casual .<br />This work is much more than simply an extarordinary film ; it's a real triumph of the western world ; an artistic treasure ; a timeless picture!

0385512104|5.0|What is it like to lack empathy?  What is it like to have to memorize what a smile looks like on a piece of paper and what it means, because you can't tell just by looking at someone's face?  Why would you put red food coloring in a curry TV dinner?<br />Christopher's affliction is not mentioned, but it is assumed by the reader to be a high-funtioning form of autism, such as Asperger's Syndrome.  His mind is completely logical.  He is brilliant at math, but he can't read other people's emotions, doesn't undertand sponteneity, and can't stand being touched.  It is amazing how well this book conveys Christopher's mind: I find myself questioning whether it really is any less logical for 3 red cars to mean that a happy day is ahead, than it is for sunshine to mean the same thing.<br />One evening, Christopher finds his neighbor's dog murdered.  He decides to launch an investigation and writes everything down.  Along the way, he discovers all sorts of things about his neighbors, his friends, and even his family.  Yes, there is math and science sprinkled throughout the pages, but it is important to realize that this is how Christopher thinks.  Not knowing algebra does NOT detract from the effectiveness of this book.
B000024D4R|5.0|Pigs on the Wing, Dogs and Sheep I like. But, it took me a while to get into &quot;Pigs&quot;. It is not as open or whatever as the other songs, but anyway this is good Pink Floyd music. If you like Wish You Were Here, you will like this.
1592400876|5.0|This book inspired me to cut out a full page ad that the company I work for took out in a national newspaper, use red ink to correct the punctuation (and grammar) and mail it (anonymously, because I'm not THAT brave) to someone I got out of the company directory that works for the PR section.<br />As this book points out, if I don't do something about it, who will?<br />This is a really fun and interesting book.  I really enjoyed it.  It's a very quick read, so everyone should read it.  Think of how many people you'll be able to impress when it becomes clear that you know how to use a semi-colon!  You're pretty much guarenteed a raise at work.
B00005QDW5|5.0|I started out on Pink Floyd with this. This has most of Dark Side and a lot more. If you are starting out on Pink Floyd, pick this of Dark Side of the Moon up.
B0000DZ3IG|3.0|I really liked this movie when I saw it and I especially loved the way music played such a big role in the story. I knew I needed to have the soundtrack. The tracks listed are beautiful but I have to confess, it's just better in the movie. The music lost some of its magic from the record store to my home. I find myself constantly skipping over some of the middle songs which, to me, are just not that important or even likeable.  I couldn't even remember where they came in the movie.<br />However, there are some in there that hit the nail on the head and bring the scene back to you EXACTLY. You'll find the very great &quot;Both Sides Now&quot;, &quot;Jump&quot; (insert images of Hugh Grant dancing here), &quot;All You Need Is Love&quot;, the beautiful &quot;Turn Me On&quot;, the hilarious &quot;Christmas Is All Around&quot;, and the awesome, AWESOME cover of &quot;All I Want For Christmas&quot;. <br />I have to say, it's a worthwhile cd after all and I recommend it to anyone who admires the nice mix of songs (take note though, Amazon only lists 14 tracks of the 17 actually included) and to anyone who liked this great movie.
0618526412|4.0|I'm surprised at the spate of negative reviews. It wasn't the greatest book ever, and I certainly don't agree with what it says on the jacket about McCullers being &quot;the most enduring of all the Southern writers&quot; but the book has a lot of really great insight and it was obviously meant to be have a low key, lazy pace, aimless....just like the South itself.<br />I admire the style, I especially appreciated how, eventhough it was all written from a third person limited omniscient perspective, that the voice of the writing subtly changed to suit the clip of the character in the chapter.<br />Not just any writer can do that.
B00005YXZH|5.0|This is the first Wilco album I've ever heard, and I must say its amazing. Coming from a new listener's point of view, I think the songs are really amazing in that they are experimental but highly listenable. Little sound effects in songs like Radio Cure and (my favorite track) I am trying to break your heart make the album really interesting. The songs seem to be really well written also. I particularly like Jesus, etc... it almost reminds me of a Steely Dan song.<br />Most of the songs on the album are really mellow. It seems pretty laid back, although some songs transform from subtle acoustic tunes to pure white noise, which isnt a bad thing. If you're used to standard verse-chorus-verse song styles and nothing out of the ordinary, you might not enjoy this album. It's definitely something different, which is fine with anyone who has listened to experimental music before. As I said before, the great part about this album is that although it is experimental, the songs are still good quality and you can enjoy them over and over.
6305075492|5.0|It has been rumored for years that when the producers set out to make The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari they intended to end the film with Caligari getting captured and no framing story. Wrong! A first draft of the film's script shows there was always intended to be a framing story. But the one that was first intended was different than the one presented on film. Originally Francis and Jane were supposed to be at a picnic years later and reminiscing about their days in the town when murderer Caligari showed up. This was changed to the looney bin frame story probably so authority woudn't be depicted quite so negatively. Agreed the film is brilliant and powerfully scarey in it's final execution (no pun intended).
0060516402|5.0|Overall, this is an excellent book about how to build a company that will stand the test of time. The authors present the information in a format that is easy to read for the senior executive or someone with no business experience. While the authors present detailed and informative examples of actions that businesses have taken to be successful, the number of examples can become cumbersome. If someone is looking for a quick reference of strategies to improve a company, this is probably not the book for them, but if an individual is looking for an in depth report on techniques used by companies, it would be a useful tool.  This book's intent is to show you the cogs that matter and give you some framework by which to align them to drive a company constantly/relentlessly forward.  Often managers get lost in the P&amp;L of the day.  While that is important, it may not be enough to keep the fiber of the organization together.  This book can serve as a reminder to us all of what is important to maintain a business that is financially successful but more importantly keeps its employees and customers happy. This book's simple goal is to shatter two myths that many believe a visionary company is founded upon, the incredibly innovative product and the charismatic leader.
B000002UAR|5.0|This album was released in Britian before the Beatles last American concert at Candlestick Park. The British version here includes material from the American only release of &quot;Yesterday and Today&quot;. Even without the extra tracks it shows that the Beatles while still working as a group are showing some flowering into thier own sounds. Paul is more hit oriented with songs like &quot;Eleanor Rigby&quot;, &quot;Here There and Everywhere&quot; John is more edgier with songs like &quot;She Said She Said&quot;, and &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows&quot;, George is getting into the act with &quot;Taxman&quot; as a slam that John wishes he would've wrote, and the love song &quot;I Want To Tell You&quot; that Paul could've written, but &quot;Love You To&quot; is George's alone as he showcases his sitar playing on this rather well, and Ringo just wants to have fun, and &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot; is given to him. Even with the personalities starting to flex thier muscles they still show group harmony with the song &quot;Good Day Sunshine&quot;. Revolver has had some interesting raps taken at it as &quot;The Acid Album&quot; as the group was experimenting more and more with LSD, and also one of the numerous signs that &quot;Paul Is Dead&quot;. With the album cover showing John, Ringo, and George facing front Paul is given a side shot like he doesn't fit in. However, it's still a worthy album, and it's my all time favorite.
0553382179|2.0|There's some good advice here; however, the turn-off for me is Ms. Cilley's personality, and the book is infused with it.  Most of the reviews giving this book/system less than five stars (and/or five exclamation points in the all-caps title) reflect many of my thoughts on this book--the treacly homespun attitude, the annoying religious references, the inability of Ms. Cilley to accept differing opinions (when I once disagreed with her, it was the subject of her next mass mailing), the demands to wear shoes in the house (sorry, not gonna do it), etc.  For me, the negative outweighs the positive, and there are plenty of other books out there with essentially the same advice.
B000008GHW|1.0|I never thought this would happen that I would give a Hendrix album a rating below 4 stars. However, I've grown up since I bought this album since I was 15. Not saying that I'm ultra-conservative borderline Libertarian, but I don't feel that this was as good an album as I originally thought. To me this was a suicide note sent to us from Hendrix himself. His playing is extremly uninspired even if he was going back to his roots which were the blues. Mind you Hendrix did have alot on his plate as he was now being forced to play with black musicians while he was a free spirit, and wanted to play with whoever he wanted. His performances after the Band Of Gypsys concert were becoming more and more burdensome I used to have a copy of his concert at Randall Island, and it was a absolute terrible performance. Almost 2 months after that show Hendrix would be dead. I feel that Hendrix cheated us by an early death, but in the song &quot;Angel&quot; I can't help but feel that's what he wanted at this point. I know during my depressing times &quot;Angel&quot; rings loud and clear in my head, and I feel that's what was happening in his. I know he was losing his faith real fast it came in loud and clear with the song &quot;Straight Ahead&quot; with the line &quot;They Don't Give A Damn... If Your Hair Is Short, Or Long&quot;. I know that there were 2 controversal murders that took place during this time On the hippie side you had the Manson family murders, and on the clean cut side you had the McDonald murders in which Green Beret Doctor Jeffery McDonald was being accused of murdering his whole family, and blaming it on the hippies. People were starting to wake up I guess, and see that people were really people regardless of hair length. I know that 3 weeks before his death Hendrix after smashing his guitar at a performance had asked the audience if anyone knew the answer to peace to meet him backstage. What a shame. He knew Phil Keaggy, and declared him the greatest guitar playerin the world, but it was shortly before Keaggy became a Christian that Hendrix would o.d. on barbituates. Imagine if Keaggy had led Hendrix to the Lord what could've happened. Unfortunately what we are left with is a album from the greatest rock guitarist at his lowest even unto death.
B000007SIJ|1.0|I should've paid more attention to the other comments concerning the deletion of the song, &quot;Intro&quot; before the song Fly Like An Eagle.<br />Do the people who made this DTS Surrond CD fall asleep when the disc was being mastered?  To leave out the song &quot;Intro&quot; shows they don't care about the product and probably never listened to the complete version which has the song &quot;Intro.&quot;<br />Anyone who purchased the disc should get their money back or if they ever redo the disc please include &quot;Intro&quot; and send us a free copy!

0783116934|5.0|From Robert Cullen's true crime novel, &quot;The Killer Department&quot; comes HBO Studio's &quot;Citizen X&quot;. Originally cablecast on HBO February 25, 1995, Donald Sutherland won the Golden Globe for Supporting Role Best Performance by an Actor in a Motion Picture Made for TV in 1996 and also the Emmy for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Special in 1995.<br />Based on the true story of the eight year long manhunt in communist Soviet Union (1982 - 1990) for one of the most savage and elusive serial killers on record - Andrei Chikatilo (a chilling Jeffrey DeMunn).<br />The story starts out with newbie forensic pathologist, Viktor Burakov (a great Stephen Rea), and his first cadaver that comes into the morgue. A quick nightime search of the wooded area where the body was found is completed with eight MORE bodies found in varying degrees of decomposition and desication.  All are children, boys and girls alike and have been murdered, raped and mutilated in some very odd ways.<br />Viktor, somehow, is put in charge of the WHOLE blessed case by Colonel Mikhail Fetisov (Donald Sutherland). With Viktor now being forensic expert, detective, and case cracker extraordinaire, he is more than a little wary of his own capabilites and feels like the only man who cares about these horrific murders that are taking place.<br />The investigation continues on for many years with many murders being committed over time because the case is being buried under the communist parties' government red tape and &quot;poo pooing&quot; by the Colonel's superior and sinister leader, Bondarchuk (Joss Ackland).<br />Thankfully and finally the cold war hits and Viktor is given permission to bring in a psychiatrist, Dr. Alexandr Bukhanovsky (Max von Sydow) to create a psychological profile of the serial rapist and murder. Not only is this the first case of serial murder in the USSR but the first to employ psychological profiles, US FBI tactics, and dissemination of the crimes to the general populus.<br />With fifty-two victims to his name, the killer they deem &quot;Citizen X&quot; finally takes shape right before their eyes... Watch this doozy of a true crime story and see if they &quot;KATCH THEIR KILLER&quot;!<br />All of the performances are top-notch with only a bit of the Russian accents faltering a bit, even in Sutherland's double award-winning portrayal.

B0000DG00B|5.0|The deep dark secret in the lives of your parents (and by now possibly your grandparents) is that there once was a period referred to as the &quot;late 1960's and early 1970's&quot;.  It may interest you to know that your Dad who works 60-80 hours a week at his upscale law practice or financial brokerage firm once spent entire weeks traveling from concert to concert, smokin' weed, combing his four foot length hair, and making love not war with hippie chicks who refused to wear bras because they were into the natural beauty of their nubile young bodies.  It also may interest you to know that your mother who wears designer suits with expensive shoes to work and is constantly quoting Bible verses in the face of your problems was once one of those hippie chicks who used to get naked and dance in the middle of huge outdoor concerts higher than a kite.  Your father refused to take a job because he didn't want to be corrupted by money and your mother was known to drink Boone's Farm Strawberry Wine and to repeat &quot;let the music set you free&quot; to all who would listen.  As they say, it was different back then.<br />It was also a time when the Allman Brothers Band was just a bunch of kids.  This current artifact before us finds the band performing much of the same material that would be turned into the classic THE ALLMAN BROTHERS AT FILLMORE EAST eight months latter.  There are two things, which must be said at this point:  1.)  There is no excuse not to have THE ALLMAN BROTHERS AT FILLMORE EAST in your CD collection-if you don't have it now, go get it.  And 2.) LIVE ATLANTA INTERNATIONAL POP FESTIVAL:  JULY 3 &amp; 5, 1970 cannot compete with the afore mentioned classic and isn't meant to.  Instead what we have is a set of performances that have a different spirit behind them.  While the renditions of these songs are not a confident as on THE ALLMAN BROTHERS AT FILLMORE EAST, they have a freewheeling exhilaration and rawness that perks up your attention.  We have the original Allman Brothers lineup with Duane Allman and Berry Oakley as well as the addition of Thom Doucette on harmonica and Johnny Winter sitting in with guitar on the July 5th performance of &quot;Mountain Jam&quot;.  All this comes as a love letter from the band written long ago.<br />The Allman Brothers Band would go on to a series of tragedies and humiliations in the years to come.  Duane Allman and Berry Oakley would lose their lives in motorcycle accidents in just a few short years.  Gregg Allman would go through multiple marriages and addictions.  The band would break up or go dormant several times.  Finally Dickey Betts would cross the line just one last time and get himself kicked out of the band.  All this does not detract from the fact that not enough good things can be said about the band-especially in it's early years shown here.  Anyone who had put down their joint and put their clothes back on long enough to just sit there and listen would tell you the same.  Things have changed since then, as things must-but not all change is for the best.  Recent concerts and music videos resemble less musical performance than cheerleading demonstrations.  While sentiments and attitudes toward women in 1970 were less than enlightened, there was little doubt that our musical heroes loved women.  I am less than 100% convinced that today's &quot;stars&quot; actually like women.  The Allmans represented a time when you could ask a rocker to sit on a stool with his guitar and sing you his song all by himself and he could give a good accounting for himself.  Many if not most of our current &quot;stars&quot; could not do that:  the actual playing of music is left to the specialists.<br /><br />Fans of the Allman Brothers Band have many shortcomings-a lot of the things we did way back in 1970 were ridiculous and breathtakingly shortsighted.  We would be less than amused to have our children and grandchildren know about some of the things we did back then.  But the reason this music bears multiple editions and different concert recordings is that both the band and their fans care about the music.  You would think having the first twenty-three various recordings of &quot;In Memory Of Elizabeth Reed &quot; would be enough for your average ABB fan; but it isn't nearly enough.<br />The liner notes indicate than parts of these performances were released as part of THE FIRST GREAT FESTIVALS OF THE SEVENTIES-a &quot;Woodstock&quot;-like album put out in the early 1970's.  Not much is said where these tapes were all this time nor why nothing was made of them until now.  In any event, the quality is good to excellent with few embarrassing excesses common to the times.  (For that just listen to the announcer's introductions before both of these performances).  By all means, get THE ALLMAN BROTHERS AT FILLMORE EAST to get your mind right.  That album is like drinking excellent whiskey straight, pure and at full strength.  Then get LIVE ATLANTA INTERNATIONAL POP FESTIVAL:  JULY 3 &amp; 5, 1970 for an additional good time.  Not quite as good; but different enough to be good all the same.s music bears multiple editions and different concert recordings is that both the band and their fans care about the music.

B000002KNY|5.0|On the Talking Heads' third release from 1979, Fear is more than a word in the title, it's the dominant theme of the album. And the album is maybe the best they ever made.<br /><br />Song after song, we encounter fear in the form of vagrancy (Cities), politics (Mind), and over-medication (Drugs). David Byrne is like the crazy loner on your street who has a lot going on upstairs. And I can't think of another song that expresses existential ambivalence as beautifully than Heaven, where nothing ever happens.<br /><br />Musically, Fear of Music is a panorama of funk-rock groove-scapes that perfectly follows the famous George Clinton prescription: free your mind and (you know the rest). With Remain in Light too gothic and Speaking in Tongues too dance-club, this album contains the most enduring sonic structures The Heads would offer until the release of Little Creatures.<br /><br />Talking Heads was on a pinnacle with Fear of Music, and that's a very high position in rock history.
0446677450|5.0|With all of the junk available on tv, the internet, in newspapers, rags, magazines and even certain books, I found this book by Robert Kyosaki like a breathe of fresh air.<br />Kiyosaki will tell you some things you don't want to hear like a house is not an asset, why people in the E-Quadrant are paying the absolute most in taxes and more. I agree wholeheartily with Mr. Kiyosaki. We must change our thinking if we want to change our results.<br />Great book. A must read. I also recommend the E-Myth.
B00000DC10|5.0|Seriously. There is absolutely no reason why you shouldn't own this CD. OK, so the vocals are a bit on the yelled/screamed side--and pretty much everything your parents and Government believe in, this is against. This is the sound of your soul banging its heads against the walls of oppression, indifference, laziness, apathy, capitalism, globalization (which is really just American Hegemony), and every other lie that has been spread like so much filth across our blue-green orb. Not only is the music here breathtakingly beautiful, this is an album of ideas. You might not agree with all of them, but in a world where free speech and intelligent political discussion are being crushed like a wet paper cup, an album that can take a stand is much more precious whatever other crappy CD you were going to buy. Buy this instead so you can ROCK &amp; THINK!
1563523302|5.0|I am continually amazed when people think that all of their money problems will be solved with more money. But when they get that &quot;more money&quot; what do they do with it? They spend it! Or as they say; &quot;I spend my money on my lifestyle!&quot; And these are the people who are behind on their car note, still paying rent and have credit card debt up the cazoo. And they are probably the same people giving this great book 1 stars.<br />Get a clue! If you keep spending all of your money on your lifestyle, guess what? You'll always have to. And you'll always be broke as well.
0345440803|2.0|If you're into schedules, this book is for you.  I found it useless.  Her attitudes towards toddler nursing is deplorable.  What are her credentials?  A &quot;baby whisperer&quot;?  I guess I just don't get it.  I didn't read the first book and I'm glad.  I read a more attachment parenting friendly book and found its contents much more my style.
B00003CXAT|5.0|Jurassic Park was more than just a movie. More than an event. It was a full blown phenomenon! Steven Spielberg is the unrivalled king of such films. Every few years he puts out another spectacular that sweeps the world and sets a new standard (like Jaws, Close Encounters Of The Third Kind, E.T., Raiders Of The Lost Ark, etc.). This time out, we've got resurrected dinosaurs running amok! The basic plot has stranded people on dino-island trying to keep from becoming dino-chow. You've got your scientists (Sam Neil, Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum), your crazy zillionaire (Richard Attenborough), a greedy, lecherous computer geek (Wayne Knight), a sleazy lawyer, and two cute kids to round out the cast. You even get Samuel L. Jackson as a chain-smoking computer tech guy! Throw in an approaching hurricane, and you've got the perfect monster movie! It's usually not the &quot;deep&quot; storyline (except in the cases of Spielberg epics like Schindler's List, Amistad, Saving Private Ryan, The Color Purple, etc.) that causes the phenomenon. It's his way of thrilling us and breaking new cinematic ground that we love. I knew when I first saw JP that I was in for a blast. At the same time, I also knew that I wasn't going to see Hamlet or Macbeth! Jurassic Park blew my mind with it's realistic T-rex, Raptors, Triceratops, and the rest. We saw dinosaurs that were not rubber, clay, or robots (well, at least not robots that looked like robots)! We got CGI that put flesh on 65 million year old bones! The team that made this movie are legendary, and have pushed special effects to stratospheric heights. JP is a true milestone that stands the test of time. Belongs in every DVD collection...
B00005JMFQ|2.0|This could have been a good movie if some of the stories had been left out.  I'm not a prude but the couple simulating sex scenes really was awful!  It definitely deserved the \\"R\\" rating.  I'm glad I watched it alone as I would have been embarassed.  Some of the actors/actress were great like Colin Firth and Hugh Grant and that's the only reason I gave it any stars at all.
B00004BZ0N|3.0|I love the Clash's first album. It was exciting, political and brash.  The second album was more of the same. Perhaps it wasn't as exciting as the first but it was still punk rock. So when London Calling came out I was really looking forward to it. The Clash are doing a double album, yeah! I remember seeing the cover picture of Paul Simonon smashing his bass and going \\"All right! This is gonna rock!\\"  Then I heard \\"Train In Vain\\" on the radio and thought \\"what the F@ck! This doesn't rock at all!\\"  I thought well maybe thats just the sell-out song for the radio, nope.  What I got instead was a large dose of radio friendly pop-punk shlock for suburban Amerikan teen mass-consumption and I can't remember ever being as disappointed about an album before. I wanted the Clash dammit, not this crass adventure in musical dilletantism.  I don't care how many styles they attempted to play.  Whats the point, where's the energy, where's the anger?  Who f*ing cares about the lyrics when the music is lame?  Goddammit where are the guitars?!?!  Who the hell thinks that trumpets and saxophones are punk rock?!?! The cover completely belies what the album sounds like, the Clash are complete pop rock sell-outs!<br /><br />Thats how I felt then, twenty some years later my opinion has changed, a bit. I realize that every band wants to grow musically, few people want to play the same music year after year. However I still think \\"London Calling\\" is overated. It covers far too many musical styles without adding anything new to any of them and most importantly its too god damned wimpy sounding to be called punk rock.  London Calling is far too self important and self-indulgent for my tastes.  \\"The only band that matters\\", yeah, right, f@ck you.<br /><br />After hearing Joe Strummers' previous pub rock band the 101ers I realised that the Clash never were real punks anyway, just musicians jumping on the punk bandwagon because that was happening at the time. London Calling is too phony for me, where's the punk rock dammit?  There are just far too many songs on London Calling with shallow by the numbers leftist lyrics and no rock. \\"Spanish Bombs\\" anyone?  It's just corny. If you want to hear genuine anarchist political lyrics listen to some Crass. By comparison London Calling is lightweight pop music more interested in radio friendly sloganeering and entertainment than social change. Not that there aren't some very good songs on London Calling. \\"Lost in the Supermarket\\" ironically works as an anti-materialist screed in large part because of its friendly pop music sound.  \\"Waiting for the Clampdown\\" is simply great and is a song worthy of the Clash. I'd give the album more stars but it's not very energetic.  I much prefer the sound of live bootlegs I've heard where the band plays the entire album as though they have some balls. Now that's punk rock. I never bought another Clash album again and instead started listenining to the Dead Kennedys, The Damned, Black Flag, Minor Threat, etc. BTW, the best thing about London Calling is the cover which effectively pays homage to Elvis Presley's first album released in 1956.nk rock dammit?

B0001NBMBC|5.0|Ok, i see people are giving Slipknot props thankfully. It doesn't sound like Stone Sour, it sounds like they are maturing as a band and sound tighter than ever. Throw in a couple acoustic songs to change things up cause too much craziness gets hard to listen to over and over. When they put in a few songs that change the tempo it makes it much better than a complete balls out cd that has your head falling off. Don't get me wrong cause, self titled was awesome and Iowa was alright. This eclipses them both with genuinity and that every song is completely different. Corey Taylors singing voice has incredible range and the band just sounds sweet, especially with some drum and guitar solos. This isn't selling out at all to change their sound a bit, not to mention that its still pretty damn hard. Although you can sneak a couple songs in the car and your girlfriend wont even notice that its Slipknot. So theyre just appealing to more people, not necissarily the masses. So yep, just wanted to say that as a Sevendust, PearlJam, and Finch fan; Slipknot moves up the list with their growth as a band. Kickass cd, even after a month of straight listening to it.
B00008OLYN|3.0|This is not a metal album by any stretch of the imagination, nor is it terribly progressive.  I heard Damnation before reading any reviews and thought it was a mild, pleasant listen, but no big deal.  Something to have burbling in the background while doing other work.  Then I read  reviews of this album I was very suprised that it was so highly praised.  I'm sorry but its just not that compelling.  To be fair it does has a few interesting ideas and melodies but for the most part sounds much like Porcupine Tree or Caravan at their most noodly. The songs are long, sometimes meandering and don't take the listener on much of a dynamic ride.  In other words Damnation is good but somewhat bland.<br />Perhaps so much praise has been heaped upon Damnation because of its difference to Opeths other work?  Its a ballsy move for a band to put out an album that departs from the sound its known for, thats fine.  Unfortunately Damnation just isn't the masterpiece the fans seem so deperately to want it to be.
B00005JM20|1.0|The plot sucks. Mr.bean sucks. The movie sucks. The actors suck. The villan sucks. The DVD sucks. The sountrack sucks. The credits suck. you suck. The title sucks. The story line sucks. The jokes suck. The best part was at the end of the movie where i shut the damn trash off.
B000002552|5.0|The Band were a pretty fine, er, band...and even better when Bob brought out their talent like he did. But here's something I finally did for myself (besides obtaining the &quot;Genuine BTs&quot;). From this commercial release, I put all the songs where Dylan sings onto one disc. The result is so pleasing: 46+ minutes worth of fun I call &quot;The Only-Bob Basement Tapes.&quot; It's way better than often skipping to his stuff track-to-track anyway -- Bob Dylan's &quot;stuff&quot; being just too magical to always sit alongside The Band's studio takes.
B00004X01U|4.0|After the sublimely trippy masterpice that was &quot;Ray of Light&quot;, Madonna could have attempted to replicate her previous success, or take her career in a new musical direction.<BR>She chose the latter, and though the album as a whole has had to grow on me, I think it's a great effort, and quite a funky payoff.<BR>As always, she makes an excellent choice of producer, Mirwais, who can make his synthesizer squeal and beats gyrate seamlessly in a collection of fabulous tunes.<BR>Though a bit silly at times lyrically, it is intended to be a relatively light-hearted album, and the opening song is definitely one of her best ever. Each time I hear it, it sounds fresh.<BR>Other than that, the highlights for me are the excellent and fervent &quot;Don't Tell Me&quot;, the bouncy collaboration with William Orbit &quot;Amazing&quot;, and the playful, if a bit tacky &quot;Nobody's Perfect&quot;.<BR>Her album following this one,&quot;American Life&quot;, however, is more solidly engaging, though both albums are worthy products from such a sensational entertainer.
006092988X|5.0|I bought this book mainly because I had always seen it on high school book lists but never read it while I was in high school, and thought I should read it.  It turned out to be so much better than I'd expected!  I couldn't put it down - loved it.  Francie is a great character.  It's both very interesting to read about her life in Brooklyn in the early 1900's and hear about her conflicts with her mother as she gets older and more independent - a timeless theme.  Francie's aunt is probably the most colorful, standout character.  Many (particularly in that era) would disapprove of much of her behavior, but she is in the end far more generous and loving than many \\"religious\\" people who frown on her.  <br />The book also has the potential to get kids (and adults too) to think about how they would have coped with the life and situations in the book.  For example, how would they feel had they been completely responsible for younger siblings when they themselves were only five years old?  Would they have been strong-willed enough to find a way to get to college while still helping her family as Francie did? Some great discussion points.  It could also be a good way to connect to family stories from the older generations.  (\\"Wow, Grandma did that too, huh?\\")<br />The book is definitely most appropriate for mature middle school children, high schoolers or adults.  Although the language level is not all that difficult, the book is long (although a quick read) and deals with some \\"adult situations\\" - the pain of childbirth, sex out-of-wedlock, even a brief touch on methods of ending an unwanted pregnancy, etc.  But for all those reasons, it makes a fabulous read.<br />Get the book for the rich descriptions of both the neighborhood and the characters, and just overall a great read.  (And if you like stories such as this, visit the Lower East Side Tenement Museum in New York City if ever you're there!)
B000001OAA|5.0|To me, one of my all time favourites by this stellar band, their debut showcases their raw engery that would later be channelled into avenues down the road of techno, that would be still more captivating.<BR>The beginning song starts off the album perfectly with lyrics about obsession, ego, and cyncical self-awareness...then follows into endless highlights such as the smoothy penetrating \\"Queer\\"...and continues on and on to form an album you might never have imagined could be so consistantly, jaw-droppingly brilliant in its edge, wit, and melodic span.<BR>Songs like \\"Stupid Girl\\", \\"Stroke of Luck\\", and \\"As Heaven Is Wide\\" are unstoppable and just as satisfying with repeated listening.<BR>At the end of this tale of self-deprication, self-examination and sly remarks on the state of society's conciousness as a whole, is a touching song, \\"Milk\\", filled with the culmination of the fragility, tenderness and sensitivity barely in sight all along. In it are knowing apologies and a call for redemption.<BR>I can continually relate to this effort, and I reccomend each successive album for taking this sort of brilliance in a new direction.
0380789035|2.0|I went into this book with high expectations and was disappointed even more than expected.  As usual, Gaiman is one of the best idea men ever.  Unfortunately his writing is still a bit torturous in such a long format.  I found the characters a bit fleeting or too shallow.  Many of the characters seemed skimmed over, but when he did indulge us, they often disappeared, never to be heard of again.  Overall, the idea was awesome, but it simply didn't pan out as well as it could have.  Stick to his shorter stories, or books he worked on with other, more experienced authors.<br />My biggest gripe with this book is the obvious lack of research.  If you are going to set so much of your book in a select region of the country, you should visit it.... in the winter.  As a resident of Northern Wisconsin, I found myself cringing far too much. Not only were the characters off, but I don't think he even consulted a map when picking locations.  We have a lot of interesting crazies and stereotypes up here, but oddly he didn't hit any of them.  If you have never been to the Upper Midwest, I'm sure you won't even notice, but if you live up here, read something else.
B000001E18|5.0|Intended at first to be an EP, it developed into an entire album that, though largely underappreciated, is an unusual testament to U2's versatility.<BR>It begins with the title track, an amusingly sarcastic comment on modern society's obsessions and is followed by a series of great standouts such as the endearing &quot;Babyface&quot;, &quot;Numb&quot; (the Edge's shining vocal moment), the shimmering and delightfully psychadelic &quot;Lemon&quot;, and ballads like &quot;Stay (Faraway, So Close)&quot;...and into the realm of the funky such as &quot;Daddy's Gonna Pay For Your Crashed Car&quot;.<br />I really could go on, but the point is that U2 got extremely funky with this album, and it really worked. It's so unusual, it's a trip worth taking again and again.
B000002HEP|5.0|Simply one of the very best rock records of the 90's and one of the heavy slabs of all time.<br />One massive cactus button.<br />Reminds me of Blue, The Rabbit Biker from the film, Fritz the Cat
B000089RVR|5.0|Life For Rent is full of hits.  Every song is great, including the &quot;secret&quot; ending song. The only song I skip is &quot;Mary's In India.&quot; It's slow, but certainly still not even close to bad or average. I skip it because all the other songs are so great.<BR>The best of the best on this album IMO are- White Flag, Stoned, Life For Rent, Don't Leave Home, Sand In My Shoes (favorite), See The Sun, and Closer.  These are absolutely fabulous tracks and are such a joy to listen to.  Any song from LFR would make a great single.  It's to say that with any other album...<br />I'm probably in the minority, but I think Life For Rent is a lot better than No Angel (which I heard after LFR).
B00009L1UP|5.0|When listening to music, you can get caught up in the ole,&quot; well if it is commercial, then it's crap.&quot; That is simply not the case with Queensryche's Empire. The lyrics are thought provoking like in the title track, and emotional like in &quot;Silent Lucidity.&quot; I enjoyed the album because of the vastness of the subjects and the playability of the songs. i have listened to this album so much that my family knows all the words and i cant stop. If you enjoy music simply for the fun of it and want an album that is interesting as well, this album would be great!
B00005V3Z4|5.0|A cult movie, has a lot of definitions.  Some people immediatly think of the Movie &quot;Rocky Horror Picture Show,&quot;  but I think of &quot;Donnie Darko&quot;.  The movie is the story of a kid who sees the future, his family, his girlfriend, and a person in an evil looking bunny costume.  Don't let the word cult fool you though, it can be (and normmaly is) a good, or in this case great movie.
0312995423|5.0|This book is an action/thriller/adventure story packed in 371 pages(hardcover). First of all, let me start by saying this. If you're a Computer Fanatic or genius, or are interested in technology, this book will blow you a way, and I guaruntee it. I never even knew that the NSA existed myself until I read this hardcore adventure.
B000003TAW|5.0|So, I know this album has been out for like 10+ years, but I only got it recently, so it's new to me.  I'd heard &quot;undone&quot; on the radio before, and it seems like I heard others over the years.  But now that I have the CD, I have a hard time turning it off.  <BR>But, I've come to the conclusion that Weezer sold their souls early on.  If you listen closely, they really aren't that good.  But somehow, the fact that they aren't good makes them that much better.  Everything they do is instantly popular.  Listen to &quot;undone&quot; sometime and then tell me I'm wrong.  I dare you.<BR>Anyway, rock on Weezer.  If you're going to get one cd by them, I'd recommend this one.  Maybe green, but it doesn't have as polished of a sound.
B00005JLWN|5.0|If you like the classic novel Brave New World or Player Piano and you like the movie The Matrix, then you will love this movie.  This is a great film that combines an A+ story with the latest in moviemaking action and technology.  This film speaks about human emotions and what is really important to us.  The film offers a unique distopian view of the future that delivers its message with incredible effectiveness.  I love this film!!!!
B000002LQR|5.0|Easily the best Chile Peppers Album.  Which is saying a lot, since everything they do is gold.  The Best-of album is close, but 2/3 of it were from this.  Every song is full of soul, passion, and skill.  My least favorite song on the album is &quot;suck my kiss&quot; and I still don't skip it.  Even the worst songs on this CD, and worth listening to repeatedly.  Rock on Chile Peppers.
B000002A3T|5.0|please ignore the one star reviews for this great last album from floyd featuring marooned.a must have in your collection
B0001NBMBC|5.0|One word: Wow! This album is truly a masterpiece. Don't let those silly &quot;metal elitists&quot; fool you. This is something you really don't want to miss. Wonderful acoustic pieces with great vocals and aggressive and heavy songs.<br />Songs like Vermilion, Prelude 3.0, The Blister Exists and Danger Keep Away are the future of metal. Fantastic guitar work, fast and furious drum works by Joey Jordison. Just listen to his work! All those blastbeats and snare solos on the album are just something far beyond. Corey has also improved his vocal work. Nowdays he mostly uses clean vocals which is only a good thing. This guy is a vocal god for crying out loud!<br />Get this record. Even if you haven't liked Knot before - this might change your opinion.
B00005QDW5|5.0|please disregard all the one star reviews both past or future for this classic compilation from my favourite band.very highly recommended.
0380733358|5.0|It is the height of World War II and the balance of the war could be at stake. The Germans have pinned their hopes on their master spy, &quot;the Needle&quot;. <br />This book proceeds at a brisk pace because the spy must avoid detection by ordinary Britons and escape the relentless efforts of British intelligence to track him down and stop him before he transmits critical information to Germany. These scenarios create the dramatic tension necessary to keep the story moving. <br />Besides the element of the chase, there is also a love component to this story. While on the run, &quot;the Needle&quot; falls in love with a desparately loney English woman on an isolated island off the English coast. Soon she discovers that the mysterious stranger she has fallen for is a ruthless German spy with a secret agenda. What happens from there is an exciting climax that the reader is certain to remember for years to come.<br />I also recommend the movie starring Donald Sutherland which goes by the same title as the book.

B00006AW2P|5.0|The very first album by the band that would by the end of the sixties be known as the \\"greatest rock n' roll band in the world\\" was issued first in the UK in April of 1964, a month later in the States. College age kids pretending to be middle aged American bluesmen shouldn't really work, right?? But we're talking about the Stones here, the greatest white blues/r&b band of all time and they were a year and a half out of the gates when they slammed down the tracks on their debut. UK and US versions are virtually identical except for two major points. \\"Not Fade Away\\", their first classic, is not on the UK release as it was a single only there. It is replaced by Bo Diddley's \\"I Need You Baby/Mona\\". Also the album was subtitled England's Newest Hitmakers, while the UK one has no title shown, just the stark Nicholas Wright band photo. \\"Route 66\\" kicks off the LP in grand fashion, a stage favorite at the time, followed by an outstanding version of Muddy Waters'\\"I Just Want to Make Love to You\\". Chicago blues fills the album with examples such as \\"Honest I Do\\" (Jimmy Reed), \\"I'm a King Bee\\" (Slim Harpo) and band original \\"Little by Little\\" (actually a slight rip of another Jimmy Reed tune). Chuck Berry's work makes an appearance with the Stones classic version of \\"Carol\\" The Jagger/Richards songwriting partnership is solely represented by a rare ballad, \\"Tell Me\\" (see the UK version for the full-length sudden stop), a beautiful song that paved the way for things to come. Closing with \\"Walking the Dog\\" was just the right touch with some of Keef's most exciting lead guitar while his partner Mr. Jones shines on slide with \\"King Bee\\". If you like classic '60's British blues rock you can't go wrong with the Stones' rootsy debut, a landmark in rock history.
067960085X|5.0|Fans of the movie will probably be surprised by the book. the movie tried to preserve a more innocent female lead. The book shows a working girl again like the movie she is upper class, not the type found on aa corner. In the movie, there is the traditional happy ending. in the book the ending doesn't match. i won't tell you the ending, but you will enjoy the book. Capote is terrific. i hope my improved review is more useful.
B0001XAOLQ|4.0|what I am writing here is not really intended to review this excellent film, but rather to rebut the comments made by:  Steve Hildermann from Vancouver, WA USA.  It is obvious that Mr. Hildermann is no fan of any version of Das Boot.  He sounds like the type of viewer who has a short attention span and must be constantly dazzled by explosions and big Hollywood special effects and visuals.  He sounds like a candidate for Jerry Bruckheimer's formulatic ridiculousness in which Industrial Light and Magic is the star and silly unrealistic characters and subplots are the order of the day.      Das Boot was not intended for those who may have ADD(U-571 was), but for anyone who has an interest in historically accurate and realistic protrayal or the last days of WWII, this is the real deal.  I think it no exaggeration that this is the finest submarine war film ever made.    Note:  I suggest this film be viewed with the original German language track and with English captions because the English soundtrack differs in some scenes with the English subtitles particularly in the club scenes before the mission and when the men are in their bunks talking about a brothel in France.  The English soundtrack has been \\"sanitized\\", but the subtitles reflect the actual orignal German translation.
0440236304|5.0|honestly its been three or more years since i read this burgett book, but it only took me two days to finish it. it just sucks you in and im a very slow reader. burgett is very matter of fact about his training and war time experiences.  from training accidents to killing men so badly burned there was no alternative to relieving them of their suffering. truley powerful.
0671027387|4.0|Political intrigue, high-tech science, oceanography, special-ops teams, AND a meteorite with proof of extraterrestrial life!  Wow!  This tale has it all.<br />In a presidential election year, the incumbent and his challenger duel over the role of NASA.  Suddenly, NASA finds the Holy Grail, a meteorite with proof positive of extra terrestrial life forms!  How convenient for the President who has backed NASA.  But he keeps it quiet for a week, while he brings in a team of civilian scientists who can confirm the find.  Among them, Rachel Sexton, daughter of the President's opponent in November, and also Michael Tolland, the Hollywood version of Jacques Cousteau.  Their findings are conclusive...or are they?  Enter killer special-operations teams.  Someone is in big trouble soon!  And to top it all off, the suspense takes shape on top of a mountain of ice high in the Arctic ocean.  OK, so it's a little far-fetched that NASA would go to such extremes to save itself, or even that a US Senator knows how to operate a copy machine, but isn't that why we buy these paperbacks...to suspend our disbelief for a few hours?<br />A super page-turner on the order of the Da Vinci code, Deception Point puts a little ice in your summer reading.  Take it to the shore...there is even a nod to \\"Jaws\\" in it that will keep you on your beach blanket.
0393039765|5.0|There are few books in this world that have been copied onto film with nearly no changes.  The Godfather would be the other.  Breakfast at Tiffany's came close but the book was risque so it had to be tamed down making her a tease more than a pro. but i guess i'm still talking about chuck. its great and addictive. if you read it and like it you will love anything chuck wrote. idid.
B00005N5S2|5.0|Those that are interested in General Douglas MacArthur, and admire his qualities of courage and fortitude, will find this film fascinating; it is beautifully filmed, with marvelous re-creations of the mid 20th century, and the battle scenes are very well done.<br />The speeches alone are a glory to listen to, full of passion for &quot;duty, honor, and country&quot;, and the words are so exquisitely crafted they are like the finest prose.<br />The film starts and ends in MacArthur's beloved West Point, on a blustery day, as he speaks to the cadets, and is among the many memorable scenes; others are the landing on Layte, and the signing of Japan's surrender, on the USS Missouri in Tokyo Bay, which is a fabulous re-staging of the historic event.<br />Gregory Peck gives a monumental portrayal of MacArthur; it is nuanced and brilliant, and from the old film clips I have seen of General MacArthur, subtly captures his posture and movement, with his many different pipes. This film is one of Peck's best, and it's sad it did not have more critical acclaim, as I feel it certainly deserved it.<br />Other terrific performances come from Marj Dusay as his wife Jean, Sandy Kenyon as General Jonathan Wainwright, and Ed Flanders as President Truman is quite exceptional; tough, gritty, and angered by MacArthur.<br />An excellent score by Jerry Goldsmith and cinematography by Mario Tosi complements the well-paced direction by Joseph Sargent. If it has a flaw, I feel the film makes too much of the publicity loving aspect of MacArthur's personality. Yes, he liked to use the media to his advantage, and most people who make history feel the same way no doubt...otherwise it is a fairly balanced depiction of one of the great men of the 20th century.<br />It is interesting to speculate what would have happened had General MacArthur been able to do what he thought was right, and not the &quot;capitulation&quot; and &quot;immoral compromise with evil&quot; he felt he was forced to accept. Perhaps over time millions of lives would have been saved, but I'm sure many would argue otherwise.<br />Total running time 130 minutes.<br />&quot;A soldier above all other people, prays for peace, for he must suffer and bear the deepest wounds and scars of war&quot;.over time millions of lives would have been saved, but I'm sure many would argue otherwise.<BR>Total running time 130 minutes.<BR>&quot;A soldier above all other people, prays for peace, for he must suffer and bear the deepest wounds and scars of war&quot;.
B00003CXAA|5.0|volume 1 and 2 are great. 3 leaves something to be desired. disc 4 is full of great extras. this movie is almost word for word to the book by mario puzo. puzo is a great story teller, just push play to find out.

6305537321|5.0|i love audrey hepburn. i also love truman capote. this is a stylist journey and well worth the read or watch.
B0001ZX0OW|2.0|i have to say, with all the hype about this movie, it ended up being a big flop. the story was good for the first 75% of the movie, then the ending ruined it. its like they spent all their time and effort in getting the big named actors to star in the movie, then think that will make up for the lack of script. the ending is stupid and rediculous, kevin bacon, who is a cop, just walks away from the scene with sean penn, where he just told kevin that he killed tim robbins character, and sean just walks away like nothing happened and continues his life. what a HUGE dissapointment,any fans of kevin bacon, tim robbins, or sean penn should not view this film.
B0001KL5DA|5.0|To the gentleman who was upset about the DVDs being offered in full-screen format:<br />Widescreen is preferable if -- and ONLY if -- the television program was originally shot in widescreen format (as most feature films are).  But if the show was shot using the standard television aspect ratio of 4:3 (as \\"Six Feet Under\\" was), then you WANT it in full-screen format, because that's how it was intended to be seen.  A lot of shows are adding black letterbox bars to their DVD releases in an effort to make the shows look more \\"cinematic,\\" but if the show was not originally shot in widescreen, the black bars are actually COVERING UP part of the frame, damaging the composition in order to appeal to DVD collectors who don't realize that NOT EVERYTHING is shot in 1.65:1.<br />\\"Six Feet Under\\" is being presented the way it was shot and the way the series' directors wanted it to be seen.  Kudos to HBO for NOT presenting the series in faux-widescreen.
B0001NBMBC|2.0|There is no way this is better than the old Slipknot- and even then they still held a bit of unwillingness to listen to in my judgement. anyone who said that this album was good is either deaf, hasn't heard anything off the prvious slipknot albums or just needs to be shot....twice. Granted, there are one or two good songs on the album, but I still preffer the old Slipknot- it was more metal than this crap and was way more worthy of a headbang and a good screaming to. To all who have not heard the old stuff, go pick it up- to all who have.....go play in traffic.
B000089RVX|3.0|To decrease confusion, Evanescence is just a two person band, that consists of Amy and Ben, and a bunch of studio artists. Like many others, I heard Bring Me To Life, and went out and bought this CD as soon as it came out. I went home all excited, and woke up the next morning only remembering a few songs. Why you ask? BECAUSE THIS ABLUM IS SO BORING I FELL ASLEEP DURING IT! I figured, It was just because I wasn't used to the songs that I fell asleep. I had the CD for a month and a half before I fully listened to it end to end. This is nothing but a one-hit wonder band, and most likely, the next time you hear of this band after all the radio play is over will be in something like VH1's &quot;I Love the '00's&quot;. Or the greatest One Hit Wonders. There are a few gems hidden in the evil cave though. Of course, Bring Me To Life. Going Under, Everybody's Fool, and Turniquet are listenable. Everything else is just blah and it's all filler. Nothing good. If you are anti-music downloaders and just can't get Bring Me To Life out of your head, go to ebay or something and get it half price. This isn't horrible, it is just (like one other reviewer pointed out) the most over-rated album of the year. If you like stuff like this, P.O.D. is much better, and they are sure to be around for atleast two more albums.
B0001ZX0OW|1.0|if you don't want to shell out the time and money to actually watch this turkey, here is what you need do:  just take a Norman Rockwell painting... and go to the bathroom on it.  Knowwhamsain?  Its either that or you will be forced to sit still for Sean Penn as a low-rent crime boss, who - according to his wife - could &quot;run this city&quot;, him and the mental midget knuckleheads that he pals around with, occasionally dreaming as big as to get busted for somebody else's liquor store hold-up.  Yeah, this guy's a criminal mastermind.  Then his daughter gets murdered and he has his two-man goon squad try to riot their way through the police line at the crime scene like they're in the NFL.  This, followed by a totally disgusting scene of Sean Penn IDing his dead daughter at the morgue.  Thanks for that.  I've often wanted to rubberneck at a parent's worst nightmare.  Tasteful.  If you are ever prone to philosophically wonder whether fame and fortune might have the power to turn one's mind to rubbish, just watch a Hollywood movie.

B0001ZX0OW|1.0|Ok, listen, last night I watched this sorry flim (even to call it a film is to overstate its ontological stature) and then tendered my disgust in the form of a one-star review.  Today, I find myself still reeling from the unbelievable lousiness of the pickture.  It staggers the mind that anyone can possibly tolerate this inferno of badness.  But at least one is now able to definitively write off the entire cast plus the director.  Anyone who got involved with this stinker without having a gun put to his/her head is an idiot, plain and simple.  Whaa?  You want examples?  Well, lets just say that a certain detective (kevin bacon) knows full well who committed a certain crime but decides that this particular criminal mastermind and his equally brilliant sidekicks are just too staggeringly competent and so he resolves to not even try to find any evidence - like a body floating in a river with some slugs in it, hello? - of who might have done the crime.  We are given to unnerstand that this crime will just have to go unsolved, due to the criminal genius of those who committed it.
B00008CLOA|5.0|i would like to remind a certain reviewer that the great pink floyd are a million times better than justin stinkercake and made their music on the basis of their talent and not on the basis of their looks like that bozo justync.
B0000DD7LC|4.0|I have never really been a big fan of her music, but after listening to her second disc it kind of falls short like the first one.It starts off very slow with dry up tracks like Heartburn ,Karma and the worst Walk on by (at track she never should have touched.After that the cd really pics up. With Mellow tracks like Diary and Slow Down her true skills really shines .Overall it a pretty good cd though not one to run out and grab but USED.This cd does not break new ground for her thought.Maybe next time
B00004XPPE|5.0|I've seen this movie at least 10 times, always on late night TV, and it still gets me every time. Right up until the last minute your'e hoping that all will turn out well, but of course it doesn't. It's curtains for 1964 New York, with it's World's Fair, Ed Sullivan, the Peppermint Lounge and My Fair Lady. Previously Moscow of course meets a simular horrible fate. But what a fantastic movie, full of drama and suspense. I'll never forget the reaction when the first plane is shot down, and the man who reminds them &quot;That wer'e not at a football match&quot; There are so many powerful scenes throughout the movie, too many to list here. It deserved a lot better recognition that what it got at the time. See it!
B000005AYM|5.0|This is one of the best debuts ever. She put her foot in this one along with her other cds. She  created a new field in R&amp;B with her new sound. Her album can fit any mood and make you feel like a glass of wine and just relax.It starts off with the mind moving (Rimshot) and flows all the way through with hits like Otherside of the game, Sometimes, No love and maymore. This is one Cd that I can listen 2 all the way through with out pause or fast forward. She hit a home run with this one . If you like this one you will love Momma's Gun and fall in love with her latest cd Worldwide Underground its hot along with her concert.
0790729601|5.0|Austrian accented \\"Terminator\\" actor Arnold Schwarzenegger hits another home run in his career in the 1996 action thriller entitled \\"Eraser\\" and let me tell you, this movie is truly unsettling and not to mention will make you angry as such acts could in fact happen in real life as we know it although the items are a bit far-fetched with today's technologies.<br /> A special agent U.S. Marshall named John Kruger works for the Witness Protection Agency, an organization that takes witnesses of major crimes away, wipe out their identities, in order to shelter them from potential criminals who aim to kill those who witness their crimes. His latest mission is to protect a worker named Lee Cullen (Vanessa Williams) who works for a corporation named Cyrez that produces top secret weapons but a massive scandal is brewing and Lee discovers what's really going on and aims to expose the scam to the FBI. However, high level government marshals who are crooks themselves aim to kill Lee and Kruger to attempt to stop the truth from coming out. The Cyrez corporation, under the leadership of a corrupt CEO, is involved in an illegal arms deal with a Russian Mafia hitman who has had a history of murder and terrorist acts against civilians. The arms deal involves trading extremely advanced weapons that don't use any conventional ammunition and instead use magnetic pulses to fire rounds of aluminum at nearly the speed of light and if the arms trade succeed it will bring forth a horrific new era of high-tech terrorism worldwide and John Kruger must stop the arms shipment before it's too late while also protecting lee from corrupt high-ranking officials participating the scam.<br /> If Lee Cullen and John Kruger are killed, then the FBI will lose any leads and/or evidence to bring the Cyrez officials to trial and to expose the scandal to the public.<br /> This movie sometimes makes me angry not because it is bad because it is a really great movie but it's the whole concept of high-ranking government officials actually being a part of the problem than as the people trying to fight the criminals committing these crimes. I sometimes wonder how one can be able to fight such acts of capitalist greed even if they're totally fictional events.<br /> The special effects while limited are really well done especially with the way the bullets create those smoke trails when speed through the air at speeds nearly that of light plus the action sequences are really awesome especially towards the climax.<br /> The high-tech weapons are really terrifying with not only the light-speed ammunition but also how they seemingly can scan through buildings and make out movements all around the immediate vicinity. One can't help but feel really paranoid when viewing the scenes where they scan the area when seeking their targets.<br /> Once again Arnold Schwarzenegger hits another home run right out of the ballpart playing the U.S. Marshall John Kruger. Arnold's action sequences are once again in top form as he fights against the crooks aiming to eliminate both Kruger and Lee. If you loves his \\"I'll Be Back\\" and/or \\"You've just been terminated\\" lines from the \\"Terminator\\" movies, then he comes up with another brilliant line which is \\"You've just been erased\\". God I love it. Vanessa Williams is also very good playing Lee Cullen as she tries to escape the assassins pursuit of her while trying to deliver the evidence of the crime to the FBI. In all honesty, Vanessa is far better when she's acting in movies and singing and releasing albums as opposed to wasting her time on these numerous bland commercials and infomercials!!<br />My favorite though of the main characters was Star Trek actor James Caan. Man, his portrayal of the traitorous agent Degeurin is absolutely terrifying and truly vivid and brings the horrifically callous nature of the corrupt agent to `life' on the movie. I just can't help but feel really sometimes ticked off at Deguerin because of his horrific acts againstthe country!<br /> Other favorites are the late Joe Pastorelli as Johnny C. along with his mob crime family and some of the characters are really funny especially Johnny C. It's really sad that Pastorelli departed us so soon. :-(<br /> This movie is really very well done and delivers incredible action sequences, not to mention an original plot idea. The DVD as of this writing offers little of anything in the way of bonus material but is a grand improvement on the VHS.against the country! <br /> Other favorites are the late Joe Pastorelli as Johnny C. along with his mob crime family and some of the characters are really funny especially Johnny C.

B0001AP12G|4.0|Kanye West really has made a name for himself as a rapper with this album. It's loaded with great songs and various subjects. It is also loaded with skits, but I can listen to them without skipping. Overall, this album is solid from when you start it to the last song.<br />\\"We Don't Care\\" is one of the songs I listen to the most. It's supposed to be a song for the kids, as the intro says. With clever lyrics, this is a great song. \\"All Falls Down\\" is another hit off the album. Nice lyrics, basically stating that we're all self-conscious. \\"Spaceship\\" is alright, it's not exactly my favorite, but relistenable nonetheless. It has nice lyrics though. \\"Jesus Walks\\" is another favorite of mine. The current single has Kanye rapping about how he needs Jesus. My favorite line is \\"They said you can rap about anything except for Jesus. That means guns, sex, lies, videotape, but if I talk about God my record won't get played, Huh?.\\" This song is a classic. \\"Never Let Me Down\\" is another highlight of the album. With extremely nice lyrics, with Jay-Z, Kanye, and J.Ivy rapping. Ivy has the best verse in my opinion, but Kanye's gives him a run for his money.<br />The rest of the CD sort of changes. \\"Get Em High\\" is a song about what the title says. With Talib Kweli and Common showin up, I still can't feel the song. It's kinda boring, in my opinion. \\"The New Workout Plan\\" is another song I listen to over and over again. I just love the beat and the concept. He's sayin that if you follow the instructions on his tape, that ladies might be able to pull famous stars. The best part of the song comes towards the end. Everyone knows \\"Slow Jamz\\". It's just longer on this one. \\"Breathe In, Breathe Out\\" is okay, with Luda on the chorus. Kanye is aware he's talking about money, hoes, and rims. My favorite part is the beginning. \\"Golly, more of that bullsh*t ice rap, I gotta apologize to Mos and Kweli, but it is cool to rap about gold, if I told the world I copped it from Ghana and Mali. First N**ga wit a benz and a backpack, ice chain Cartier lens and a napsack, always said if I rapped I'd say somethin significant, but now I'm rappin about money, hoes and rims again\\" That line is great.<br />\\"School Spirit\\" I'm not feeling. I can listen to it a few times, but mostly gets a skip. \\"Two Words\\" is decent, with okay lyrics, and Mos Def and Freeway do the song good. \\"Through The Wire\\" everyone's heard also, so why say something? \\"Family Business\\" is a great song about being with family. Nice lyrics and flow. The chorus is great. \\"Last Call\\" has Kanye rapping for just awhile, then he talks about how he got to where he is. I just listen to the rapping.<br />Overall, I give the album a 4 star rating. It's nice to hear music that has a point. The Radio does need this. Clever lyrics, solid productions, you need this in your collection.**ga wit a benz and a backpack, ice chain Cartier lens and a napsack, always said if I rapped I'd say somethin significant, but now I'm rappin about money, hoes and rims again\\" That line is great.<br />\\"School Spirit\\" I'm not feeling.

0783225547|5.0|Many seem to have hashed &quot;Volcano&quot; which came out around the same time as &quot;Dante's Peak&quot; and it's a shame because both of them are highly realistic and te things that happen in them could literally happen in real life. Both of them are really excellent disaster flicks and are enough to really make you `think' but even then they deliver incredible amounts of entertainment. In all honesty though, \\"Dante's Peak\\" is more realistic and has a more compelling twist to it due to the volcano's more destructive power.<br /> In this case, a small town is thriving in the mountains of Washington state and has recently been declared one of the best places to live in in the United States. Dr. Harry Dalton, a scientist is sent to the vicinity to survey unusually high geological activity but one day he makes an alarming discovery that the volcano that the town sits on the base of, has come back to life and geological surveys have cofirmed that Dante's Peak is about to erupt in a cataclysmic eruption and wipe out the town and it's people. Rachel Wando, the town's mayor along with Dalton now must try to evacuate the town before the volcano erupts but their safety is stifled by their economic interests.<br /> This is a really excellent and highly compelling movie. The special effects are absolutely thrilling and highly realistic and the movie's plot and script are very good. The lava and plumes of ash and dust are highly realistic looking and scary to watch as the volcano starts spewing out it's contents into the atmosphere and surrounding vicinity. The characters are excellent even though the acting could've been a little better but the acting for the most part is excellent by almost if not the entire cast.<br /> I was thrilled to see this on the big screen because I have had a longtime fascination with volcanoes for almost my entire life and \\"Dante's Peak\\" succeeds in delivering a thrilling tone and is very enjoyable for most of its length.  The DTS edition is absolutely incredible because the sound quality is a gargantuan improvement on both the VHS and older DVD editions and if you have a stereo system with speakers all around you, then hook them up and the surround audio speakers will make you feel almost like you're back at the movie theatre with the awesome sound quality.<br />If you can, get this movie whenever possible because it is a really excellent natural disaster thriller and delivers far more scares than these so called `horror' movies because most of them are just mindless gorefests that are more gross than scary but \\"Dante's Peak\\" is scary because it is so realistic and such things could happen and could turn out much worse. For example Mt. Rainier near Seattle could erupt at any time and cause a lot of damage nearby and Seattle may be choked with dust if a full blown eruption occurs even though the city and most of its suburbs would pull through relatively unscathed apart from having a snow of volcanic ashes but it could cause social instability. Even Mt. St. Helen's caused a great deal of destruction and wiped out a large amount of forests around it. \\"Dante's Peak\\" is an excellent movie that should not be passed up. End of story.absolutely incredible because the sound quality is a gargantuan improvement on both the VHS and older DVD editions and if you have a stereo system with speakers all around you, then hook them up and the surround audio speakers will make you feel almost like you're back at the movie theatre with the awesome sound quality. <br />If you can, get this movie whenever possible because it is a really excellent natural disaster thriller and delivers far more scares than these so called `horror' movies because most of them are just mindless gorefests that are more gross than scary but \\"Dante's Peak\\" is scary because it is so realistic and such things could happen and could turn out much worse.

B000003TA4|5.0|This record totally changed the way everyone felt about music in the early 90's. How can't you give it 5 stars? If you take time and listen to it and try to feel kurts anger and just try to understand the way he feels the maybe you'd feel more appreciative about this record. Kurt put everything that was going on in his life at the time into this record and look at the result. A breakthrough in the music industry. Sure he was a very controversial man, but doesnt that make him even better? So if you dont appreciate the record then please take a little more time listening to it and try to appreciate Kurt's work.
B000002H2H|5.0|In thier early days,  Metallica was unquestionably the best hard rock/Metal band on the scene.  Thier second release 'Ride the Lightning' cemented them as the premier metal band the world over.  From the thunderous 'trapped under ice' to the haunting 'for whom the bell tolls'....it boasts impressive songwriting and musicianship.<br />If you ever buy a Metallica CD...make sure you get this one.  Its thier finest hour.
B000002HH9|4.0|I just bought this album today..It is definately not as bad as some say....i have every cure album and have been following them since the early 80s..i was very mad when they gave Lol the boot, but i eventually got over it...I started trying out their new albums and realized that Rober Smith IS God..WHY?  Not because the new stuff is his best work, coz it definately isnt..17 seconds, Discentigration, Pornography are , in my opinion, his best...But, life goes on..bands evolve and grow....i see the growth in the new Cure and decided that i accept the newer material as THE CURE..I mean, look how many times the band has changed...every album is very different ..the new stuff would be more boring if it tried to be like the old....<BR>So, as for the TRUE Cure fans, buy it and give it an honest listen to , and remind yourself..it IS Robert Smith....other \\"stuck in the 80s Cure fans\\", please try to grow out of your stubborness and wake up....i did, and i am very glad....
B000002IQW|4.0|To put it bluntly....its impressive.  Good songwriting,  very well produced,  and the guitars are thunderous.  They obviously wanted this one to sound huge and it does.  A great CD....it ROARS!!
B000002HH9|5.0|well, this was the final last Cure album i was to purchase. Now, i own all of them...i had heard that this album was not very good, so i rolled with the crowd and refused to buy it...DUMB, DUMB, DUMB.....i can say this, why are Cure fans so hard on this album? I enjoyed it the minute i dropped the needle on the record..there is not one bad song on here...the production is acutally pretty amazing on this album..if you like Wish , you should buy this...my favorite songs are Mint Car, Gone, Want, and Club America...C'mon Cure fans...dont be so hard..its NOT that baD :)  be open minded ...i am very glad i own this album...<br />i can see why Robert Smith said this was one of his favorite productions...
0451196716|5.0|I have read all of Kings published novels, about 50 or so, and this is my alltime favorite.  In fact, of all the horror novels I've read, and believe me its 100s, this is the best.  Incredibly bleak, gritty, and dark. This would make a great sci-fi film but is too bloody hardcore for the mainstream.  The story follows 100 game show contestants struggling to survive.  What makes the story great is you know only 1 of the 100 will win, and the rest will all die.  It is only their willpower that will keep their life.  As the story progresses King creates realistic characters of depth that inevitably get run down by the game.  This format makes you keep turning the page, wondering how it could possibly get worse, and it does.  This is the only novel I've read 4 times.  Definately recommend for fans of bleak King, Horror, or dark Sci-Fi.  Not for the squeamish or faint of heart.
0064407667|1.0|Most reviews start with a brief summary of the story, and I, for the most part, follow suite.  But alas, for this book I cannot give a brief synopsis, for the story it's self, also seemed incapable of doing so.  During the three chapters I've read of this book,  I saw no indication of a possible story, just a mediocre attempt at trying to be macabre.<br />The Characters are flat.  No emotion, no nothing.  I didn't care what \\"unfortunate events\\" came there way.<br />Most likely the worst of all, Mister. Snicket feels the need to stop the book every three sentences to define a word.  He defines Rickety.  Now I know todays children are somewhat stupid, but come one! Rickety?  About 47% of this book is stopping to define words, taking atleast a paragraph to do so.<br />(...)
B000002LPD|5.0|The message on this is simple: It's the best one they made with Hagar as the frontman. The music sounds good, as always, but it has a harder edge than usual with Van Hagar. The music ROCKS: The drums hit really hard, the guitar cranks, and it is mixed really well. Perhaps more importantly, HAGAR CARRIES HIS WEIGHT ON THIS ONE. His voice is really strong. And there aren't any lovey-dovey lyrics like he writes so often that would make David Lee Roth (or any true Van Halen fan) puke. There is no question that this CD deserves the nod for &quot;Van Hagar's Best.&quot;

As Wayne Perryman reminds us in his book, &quot;Unfounded Loyalties&quot;,<br />&quot;One party and their abolitionist supporters believed the Bible instructed them to lay down their lives for the slaves, the other party and their supporters believed the Bible gave them the right to take the lives of blacks if they rebelled against being slaves.<br />&quot;On the issue of slavery, one party and its supporters gave their lives to expand it (to Northern states) and the other party and their supporters gave their lives to ban it.<br />&quot;One party was heavily influenced by the Abolitionists and the radical wing of their party ... and the other party was influenced by the Ku Klux Klan and other terrorist groups.<br />&quot;One party and its supporters started the Freedman's Bureau and other programs to help build communities for blacks, the other party and their supporters engaged in practices to hinder those efforts and to destroy those communities (Wilmington, North Carolina).<br />&quot;One party and its supporters established quality schools and colleges for blacks, the other party and their supporters engaged in practices that attempted to close some of those schools or diminish their quality.<br />&quot;One party passed laws and Constitutional Amendments (13th , 14th , 15th) to include blacks as part of mainstream society, the other party passed laws to exclude them from the mainstream (Jim Crow Laws and Black Codes). ...&quot;<br />Sadly, many do not know that that &quot;one party&quot; was the Republican Party, while the &quot;other party&quot; was the Democratic Party. I myself didn't know at the time I watched this stirring film. I suppose burning crosses make us assume the bad guys are aligned with the religious right. Unfortunately, the &quot;other party&quot; used a nonsensical interpretation of the &quot;curse of Ham&quot; to justify slavery; fortunately, &quot;one party&quot; saw through it.<br />This film is also a great example of how history is being rewritten or dumbed down. While many films have shown lynchings and other abuse of African Americans, they usually leave you with the impression that the bigots were &quot;Bible bashers&quot; ... as you can see, this is only half the truth. Very rarely are we reminded that it was Republicans who laid their lives on the line to defend blacks, based on their Christian faith.<br />Willem Dafoe is, as always, fascinating to watch. His gesture of futility during Hackman's interrogation of a suspect is priceless. Perhaps the shameful past that the Democrats are trying to forget - indeed, most youngsters today do not need to forget, they haven't even been taught - will spur them onto greater deeds that may even outshine the &quot;one party&quot;., &quot;one party&quot; saw through it.<br />This film is also a great example of how history is being rewritten or dumbed down.

B00014K5TQ|5.0|This movie is best suited for those who are at least interested in the club kid lifestyle and tolerant of homosexuals. I've read a couple harsh reviews, but they seem to have been written by people who have no clue what the party scene or NY club scene was about and are more concerned with judging than understanding this vastly different sub-culture. Some reviewers have even called the movie unrealistic, but this couldn't be further from the truth.<br />The parties are portrayed with incredible accuracy. The movie not only depicts what you could expect to have seen inside a club of this type, it makes you feel as though you are actually there taking part in the event. The lighting and colors used create a slightly dazed feeling, as though you're walking through the middle of a huge party, surrounded by a sea of eye-candy. The party goers are true to life as well. After all, they used old club kids as extras and featured some of them in their real outfits.<br />The drug sequences are almost too accurate sometimes, especially the come down. (At one point, they even show Alig sitting on the toilet saying, &quot;I can't pee.&quot; For those who've been there, this totally hits home.) <br />Honestly, if your plans for the weekend include sitting at home with the kids and watching a movie, this probably isn't your best bet; but if you're looking for an adventure (or if you were once a part of the scene and would love a nostalgic reminder of your past experiences) you really should see this film!
6305308659|5.0|Who says Hollywood can't make a movie that is both smart and entertaining?  Pleasantville is proof that it can.  Here is a movie that is an enjoyable escapist entertainment.  But it is also a religious allegory similar to The Truman Show, depicting the fall of man and loss of innocence in a variety of forms.<br />I don't want to connect the dots for you because you need to watch this movie closely and think about its meanings.  When is it that people begin to take on color?  What causes it for some doesn't cause it for everyone.  It is a commentary on everything from the Civil Rights and Women's Liberation movements to Christianity, Genesis and the fall of man.  And all of it is dressed up in a clever conceit about the good old days of black and white sitcoms.<br />Along with The Truman Show, this is one of Hollywood's greatest productions of the decade.  One day people will appreciate it for the masterwork that it is.
B0002858YS|5.0|I was looking for some good bands...and I ended up in  amazon for some reason. Then I finnaly found the killers. But I couldln't preview the songs. So I found a web site where I heard THE WHOLE ALBUM!!! It was sooo amazing! I was literaly lifted off the ground!! I fell in love!!, I bought (actually ordered) yeah yeah yeahs, the Strokes, Von Bondies and Franz Ferdidand. Then I finnaly ordered the Killers. Out of all of those CDs I can't wait till I get the Killers!!! I'm addicted...They're awesome..Its something new about them..that no other band has adchived so far (well not counting the bands I ordered CDs from)I just don't listen to plain rock its boring for me.. And if you're my kind of person and your music has to be fun, different, and exiting you should deffiniatly buy this CD
6305252521|5.0|It amazes me that so few people notice that this is a religious allegory.  Sure, on the surface this is about how the media have invaded every square inch of our lives, and it is a prescient take on reality television, but more than that, the story is about the fall of man and the end of innocence.  If you've seen this before, watch it again and notice the parallels to Genesis, especially near the end where Christof (How obvious the name!) talks to Truman (true man) from the clouds.  He even addresses himself as &quot;the creator.&quot;<br />Jim Carrey gives what is still his best performance to date.  And the screenplay gives you a great deal to think about.  Watch this and &quot;Pleasantville&quot; back to back and notice the theological similarities.  The Truman Show is definitely one of the best movies of the decade.  And I think years from now, when people really begin to appreciate the depth of the screenplay, they will come to recognize it as the masterpiece that it is.
B00008J4P5|5.0|ok...let me tell you the truth. If there was no white stripes I would stil be listening to rap. Thank god they came along, well one time I was watching MTV and then there was this music video and I fell in love with it. And of course it was white stripes!! Seven Nation Army.. It was sooo GOOD!! So I immediatly ran out and bought the album. I listened to it and all of the song swere amazing! Jack and Meg can cause soo much chaos!!! The album is awesome, when I bought the album I couldn't stop listening. Beleive me they're fresh, exotic and different! Its reallly really good! Thanks to them I fell in love with garage bands, then indie, then hard rock now I'm all about rock! Get this CD right now!! You won't regret it!
B000255LIY|3.0|In a world which sees more and more remakes - some classics are better left alone. This is one of them.  Glenn Close is no Katherine Hepburn and that's probably the major weakness of this remake although Patrick Stewart isn't a Peter O'Toole either.  The image of Jean-Luc Picard keeps popping up and you keep expecting him to utter something like \\"Make it so, Number One\\" at any moment.<br />The original also gave us a pre-James Bond Timothy Dalton as Phillip of France in a vastly underrated performance. And let's not forget Anthony Hopkins as Richard.<br />Historically, if this movie were to be made with any accuracy it would feature French actors instead of English ones since French was the language spoken by Henry and his family. It's highly unlikely any of them - including Richard and John - spoke much if any English, so if its going to be re-done, perhaps utilizing French actors is the answer.<br />Meanwhile, pop in your DVD of the O'Toole/Hepburn original and if you're wondering which version to purchase - go with the original.

B000002LOM|5.0|if you like Morrissey you will like this cd.
B00008J4P5|5.0|Elephant was a cd I was really excited about because I loved Whie Blood Cells and I knew that the Stripes' creativity would give us another solid album. Well it seems I was right, and while this one is a close second to WBC to me, it is equally brilliant if not more so. Elephant still has the sound you would recognize from the Stripes, but I think it rocks more than the previous release. Great music doesn't need technology to make it big and that is proof here. Jack and Meg White put so much heart and soul into their music that you get a complete sense of satisfaction from the time you start the album right until it is over. We all know Seven Nation Army (or we all should anyways), which is now a classic Stripes tune. My favorite from this album is The Hardest Button to Button which also has a fantastic video to go along with it. In fact all of their videos are extremely cool and innovative, a testament to the talent and creativity that is the White Stripes. Ball and a Biscuit and the cover of I just Don't Know What to Do With Myself are amazing and they will both rock you hard, as will Black Math. This album was the best release of 2003 to me, and it is really hard to say which is better out of this and White Blood Cells. But if you have heard their previous efforts Elephant will not disappoint you, that is a promise. This is music the way it was meant to be.
B00005A1PR|5.0|Great CD India! The words to her songs are full of meaning and expression. She handcrafts every detail of feeling and creates a masterpiece. The best songs on the cd are: Video, Promises, Brown Skin, Simple, God in You, and Part of My Life. These are in no particular order. I just bought this cd 2 weeks ago on the internet along with the Alicia Keys cd I purchased. On a review for the AK cd, it said Acoustic Soul was also highly recommended. I bought the CD only knowing 1 song on it and I have to say that I'm quite pleased with it. THIS IS A MUST BUY FOR YOUR CD COLLECTION!
0679809015|4.0|This book was much beloved, and ripped, by our older son.  Now our younger son is in love!  Both boys have learned animal names and sounds from this book.
B0002858YS|5.0|This is the album of the year.  I'm not the first to say it and I won't be the last. Yes, it's better than Franz Ferdinand, Modest Mouse and even The Strokes (from last year).  The Killers bring something new to the table.  They are like the band left behind during the new wave 80's era and are just now showing up.  But they are showing up with their own mix of keyboards AND guitars.  Sounds like an odd combination until you listen to this album.  It's as if The Sounds and The Strokes are out on a date and they get jumped by The Killers.  This is hard for me to say being a dubious Strokes fan, but I know when to set my bias' aside and congratulate a newer, better band.  <BR>Brandon Flowers, the lead singer, has one of those voices you will clearly recognize and find irresistable.  The combination of instrumentation the Killers use will get inside your blood, in your brain, in your soul and next thing you know you are chanting &quot;I got soul but I'm not a soldier!&quot; (Song 5-All These Things I've Done)  I could sit here and tell you what the album's highlight songs are but the truth is, the entire album is one big highlight.  My personal favorite is Andy You're a Star.  The opening guitar riff followed by lyrics like &quot;Hey Shut up, hey Shut up, Yeah&quot;  is impossible not to like.  As Mr. Flowers boasts on the song &quot;On Top&quot;, &quot;It's just a shimmy and a shake, I can't fake it, we're on top.&quot;  Right you are fellas, right you are.  And what are you doing still reading this?  This is one you need to be in on before the masses join in.
B00028HBKM|5.0|Although it will be hard for most to do, you must put your religious beliefs aside for a moment and judge this movie on its own merits.  I am neither catholic nor jewish, in fact I'm not brain washed into any such faith, and as such I was able to enjoy The Passion of The Christ as a cinematic experiance like no other.  Watching the film was harrowing and definately inspired emotions as no other movie I have ever watched has - and that is what makes this such a triumph - it is an incredable feat on the part of Mel Gibson and all concerned to create a film that reaches out and touches people in such a way - even those who do not subscribe to the beliefs of the film makers themselves.<br />Getting back to religion for a moment - the fact that it may or may not be an accurate potrayal of the gospels is neither here nor there - surely, it is more valid that it is a visual representation of the beliefs of a catholic.<br />At the end of the day, if you don't like this film, why not just go buy Schindler's List and comfortably reaffirm your persecution complex from the comforts of your home?
B000001FKY|1.0|I didn't realize that yours was the only opinion that mattered, but being the man I am, I can respect the fact that you like the Def Leppard prom band versus the Def Leppard rock band of a few years earlier.
B00003CXCT|1.0|Just bought me a used LaserDisc player and Ebay'd a used copy of the original Star Wars trilogy in widescreen on LaserDisc. Ya know, the one where Han shot first, no ridiculous CGI interspersed with model effects, and other obnoxious changes. I'll be enjoying the untouched and unmolested versions that I remember from my childhood. And you know what Mr. Lucas? I spent nearly *twice* what Amazon is charging for these DVDs. I hope you and your distribution company understand what that means in terms of lost revenue. Because I'm not alone. This coming from a male in his mid-thirties with a six figure income. I'm a good representative of your target demographic, now offended and totally alienated. You blew it, buddy. Here's to market forces giving you a well deserved clue-smack.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I bought the Firefly set on DVD on the first shipping day. It is awesome that over 6 months later it is still selling strong (currently #46 on Amazon!).<br />When this show was on the air we were confused and angry because of the pre-emptions (for the World Series) and the episodes playing out of order (the pilot was shown two months after the premiere). Let's just say that being an avid watcher was a little bit of work. When it was cancelled I decided that the executives at FOX were not playing with a full deck, it was funny, witty, the dialogue was crisp and fresh- totally unlike anything else on TV. I have pulled out the DVD with visitors over intending to just play a single episode and ended up after midnight having watched 4 or more. Invariably they had never previously heard of the show, but became instant addicts!<br />Watch it, you'll love it.<br />As proof that FOX executives have the smarts of a box of rocks, they cancelled Wonderfalls after 5 or 6 episodes. Gee, the only two inspired shows in the last decade that actually managed to capture our interest. I guess our household demographics are not what advertisers are looking for (2 adults aged 38 and 41, no kids, $150K income, college educated etc). Morons.
B000002VTE|5.0|Well I snagged an original UK promo (50 copies pressed) of this before they had to re-mix it (licensing/sampling problems) and played it from beginning to end almost every night before going to bed. The production &amp; flow of the orginial mix worked quite well, stretches of flowing tones, then melancholy chords &amp; finally sonic mayhem. I then picked up a copy of the Japanese version (w/ the Broken Heart Instrumental as a bonus track), which felt a little more stifled....but oh that broken heart works wonders...even without words.<br />I then saw them tour for this album &amp; was it a show.....one of my all time favorite concerts.  The light show really was quite an assault on the senses &amp; the cacophony of Cop shoot Cop worked even better live than on disc.<br />Snagging a copy of the original &quot;Ladies &amp; Gentleman...&quot; track would be worth it....but I ain't going to part with my copy to see what the going price is, so don't ask.
B000099T2L|1.0|&quot;Crazy In Love&quot;, &quot;Naughty Girl&quot;, and &quot;Baby Boy&quot; were good songs until they were played to death.  That leaves one more track that made this album almost worthwhile and that's &quot;Hip Hop Star.&quot;  After track four the rest of the album falls to pieces with slow, uneventful ballads and lame qausi-up-tempo tracks litter this waste of time.<br />If you like Beyonce, then grab the &quot;Austin Powers: Goldmember&quot; album for two great tracks.  Otherwise, stick to Destiny's Child and pretend Beyonce's [father's] ego didn't lead her down the path of lame music.
B00006RINF|1.0|Boy, this band is overrated.  Just because they have a pretty lead singer, they get to be on Ozzfest and in every rock/metal magazine?  I bought this cd out of curiosity-Big Mistake!! The band sounds like they just learned how to play their instruments last month.  There are absolutely no riffs, just bar chords chugging along very uninspiredly, backed up by Casio-sounding keyboards.  Kinda sounds like Europe (remember &quot;The Final Countdown&quot;?) with a (more) female singer.  Don't waste your time.  Makes a great coaster, though!
B0001NBMBC|2.0|I'm sorry slipknot fans, I did not like this cd very much at all! Have slipknot lost their touch? The only song on this album that I actually do like and love the video for is Duality! The album is a little to much on the soft side for my liking but this could be a way for slipknot to appeal and widen their audience who knows.... One star is too harsh especially as duality is an excellent song so i'm giving it 2 stars and hope for better and bigger things on future albums
B0001AP12G|4.0|I definitely don't agree with the comment before me with the straight out Kanye west diss. Oblivious to you man, wack is wack, whether mainstream or underground, and there's nothing more annoying than a dude who's gotta talk about the fools in his hood that agree with him. KanYe delivers what he's done before; strong straightforward beats and hooked joints and he delivers on it with a little more caution than J-Kwon, who I think sounds the same with his last 2 released singles, so there shouldn't be any comparison between the two. If you don't like commercial hip hop, then leave the surface cuz it ain't all good in the UG either, and after the whole hip hop audiences' craze for pointless typical southern drawl rap and annoying jamaican music (thought I love you still Bob Marley!), I'm more than relieved that we finally get some decent and well thought out music. The only song I don't like on here is \\"Slow Jamz\\" but it was bearable. The overall CD, though a little overdone with the interludes, was enough to keep me satisfied and hopeful that we get to see better days in Rap. \\"All Falls Down\\" and \\"Get em High\\" are most definitely, the best tracks on here. KanYe may not be the best MC, but he doesn't present himself as one. Rather, he comes to appeal to the party goin' crowd lookin for a good time, and there ain't nothing wrong with that.
0784011176|4.0|This is the first film I have seen with Holly Hunter and Harvey Keitel.  They both gave good performances, and the movie itself was strange but likeable.  Anna Pacquin and Sam Neil also gave great performances.  The movie did have a lot of nudity that was really un-neccesary.  The cinematography was good and the setting was a cool, dark, but beautiful place.  The film was very different and really surprised me, like most films do.  I recommend this for romantic buffs, and people who love to watch great performances.
B000060P79|1.0|Wow this cd sounds like my grandpa gargling mouthwash.

B00005NNT1|5.0|Snow White's Step Mother sure had the power to transform to an ugly witch, Why not use her power to transform fairer than Snow White ? In present situation there are so many people who wants quick fix, Liposuction, Facelift, Botox etc.But with Snow White's Step Mother She wished for her death instead,that's her quick fix.<BR>There's one classic Wile E. Coyote scenario also, When the Witch was being apprehended by the seven Dwarfs, The Witch is about to drop a huge boulder onto the seven dwarfs but she was strucked by a lightning and the boulder fell with her in a cliff.<BR>What's the moral of the story? Don't ask a mirror who's fairer but ask an Expert Doctor who does miracle face transformation instead.
0805062971|5.0|As rare as it is, the movie is actually better. The movie looks exactly like you would imagine the book in your head, except the scripting is slightly different. The book is fantastic; not too drawn out. It's good if you're thinking of picking up something interesting that won't take all summer to read. It's very updated and pop-culture-ish. It makes you say &quot;hmm. i never thought about it that way, but i guess that's true&quot;. the only reason i think the movie is better is because it was so much more streamlined and understandable, not jumpy (like the book tends to be). the book reads like it's coming from someone's head (which it's supposed to). sometimes thoughts can be jumbled, but the movie just visually lays those jumbled thoughts out for you in a sequence that's easier to digest. for those who can easily read and understand complicated books (think something like...if memento or mulholland drive were originally books) then this book will be among the best books you've ever read.
B0000CAQ27|5.0|I purchased this one when it first came-out, and I am still playing it quite often.  Pink's catchy grooves, intense vocals, sensual tone and tough girl attitude are reminiscent of Joan Jett with a funked-up beat and a dance rhythem.<br />\\"Missundaztood\\" is one of my favorite cds, but \\"Try this\\" works, for me.  I like the fact that she is being honest with herself and doing a few songs that she obviously felt compelled to do for herself and for her art--as opposed to pleasing the masses, or perpetually doing copy-cat songs of hits, like many bands resort to.<br />\\"Try This\\" is worth the purchase, for \\"God is a Dj,\\" \\"Trouble,\\" & \\"Oh My God (Featuring Peaches)\\" --however, I love the entire cd. The Video is a really nice bonus, as well !
B00005R62N|5.0|Quite possibly the greatest live heavy metal record ever recorded, Priests Unleashed In The East set the mark for all others to follow. The thing is, no one could follow in the same footsteps. This is sheer live, brutal power and force. The energy of the crowd propelled the band to its greatest performance and it was captured for all the world to hear. Rob Halford never sounded better. The dualing guitars are at the forefront, the choise of songs perfect. My highlight from this CD is when the dualing guitar solo in Tyrant reaches its absolute zenith, right as Rob Halford comes in for the final chorus, the crowd of thousands and thousands of Japanese fans absolutely screams. It will make the hair on the back of your neck stand up. Perfection incarnate.
B0000VAFO0|5.0|I have been thrilled about this movie, since the first preview I saw at the theater. Kate Beckinsale has a powerful presence on the screen.  The opening scene is worth watching the movie-- Kate Beckinsale's stylish landing and rising is very impressive and kicks-off the movie with finesse.<br />I have never been much of a Werewolf movie fan, but Underworld gives The Werewolf an intensity and a Humanity that I have not seen, previously.  The motivations of the characters are fascinating.<br />The Vampire leader was a bit lame, but all of the other characters were outstanding.  The concept of Underworld, the Amazing Special Effects, sets and fast-paced Action are captivating.  I had to own this movie.<br />Currently, I am purchasing the new version: &quot;Underworld (Unrated Extended Cut)&quot; DVD -- ASIN: B0001WTUH6 -- due to the special features, extended scenes, et al.  Normally, I cannot watch a movie repeatedly, within the same year--but, Underworld stands-out as a &quot;must see&quot; and &quot;must see again&quot; film.
B00008OWZC|5.0|These 3 cd's are legendary. I was simply amazed when I heard these CD's! Disc 1 contains many of the band's most famous songs, like Immigrant Song, Black Dog, Over the hills and far away, Stairway to Heaven, and Bron-Yr-Aur-Stomp. They all sound amazing, truly legendary! Disc 2 opens with the 25 minute Dazed and Confused, and ends with the 19 minute Moby Dick. Both these songs are so amazing you hardly notice that 20 minutes has passed when the song is over. Disc 3 begins with Whole Lotta Love, and then goes on with some classic Led Zeppelin. In all, this is a truly great cd from the best rock band ever. I was a bit dissapointed because some songs were missing, like Misty Mountain Hop, In My Time of Dying, Achille's Last Stand, ect. I go on for days naming all the songs that are missing, which is why they aren't on the cd. There is simply not enough room. Still, this is a must have!
0452282152|5.0|I have just finished listening to the unabridged audio version of Girl with a Pearl Earring.  It is narrated by Ruth Ann Phimister.    As I listened to the novel, I was very emotionally involved with Griet.  I felt her happiness, her sadness, her reluctance, her longings.  But one has to remember that a Protestant in her times, especially a young girl, was meant to be reserved and to hold back her deepest desires.  I think that is why Tracy Chevalier wrote as she did.  The tone also echos the fact that Vermeer is very poor at showing his own emotions.<br />I loved this book!  In fact, it is hard for me right now to go on to another book.  I want to stay in Griet's world--I don't want to leave her.  I think that is what a good book is supposed to do for a reader.  In additon, it made me curious about Vermeer's life.  Oh, I knew his paintings, but I wanted more.  What was the real Vermeer like?  I have searched out his biography and marveled at how Chevalier intertwined fact with fiction.<br />Perhaps my feelings for this story are because I listened to the audio version of this book.  Ms. Phimister is a master at narration and is truly able to place the reader into the character of Griet.  In any event, this book will always remain one of my all time favorites!<br />This review refers to the unabridged audiocassette edition.
B00004U45G|5.0|Okay, I never thought I would say this.  I am a huge Zeppelin fan from the 1970s.  I have listened to lots of live Zeppelin, most recently &quot;How the West Was Won&quot;.  (And that's a nice compilation.) BUT<br /><br />THE CROWES DO ZEPPELIN SONGS LIVE BETTER THAN LED ZEPPELIN DID.  The vocals are better, the extra guitarists add so much punch and texture, and even the drumming sounds great (and Bonham is the gold standard).<br /><br />Now that I've confessed, I feel better.  Maybe this should be anonymous, though...
B000002UAX|4.0|The Beatles' 1968 record is self-titled, (also known as \\"The White Album\\") and that's quite an irony considering that it is the band's least group-like effort as the friction grew worse among the band members.  And it shows on this album--somewhat rambling, erratic, disorganized, disparate, a mind-your-own business kind of thing.<br />The musical differences are mainly focused, on this album at least, between John Lennon and Paul McCartney, which is quite an interesting study.  John's material describes his eccentric, obscure wit and moody attitude, a perfect foil to Paul's well-constructed and earnest melodies which John once dismissed as \\"nursery rhymes\\".  And well, each of their songs has its moments indeed.  John wrote stuff, among many others, the jolly \\"Everybody's Got Something To Hide Except For Me And My Monkey\\"; the turgid \\"Yer Blues\\"; the acerbic \\"Glass Onion\\"; the optimistic \\"Dear Prudence\\"; the insinuating \\"Sexy Sadie\\"; and the simple, plaintive \\"Julia\\".  He also recorded the weird \\"Revolution 9\\" as his attempt to make an avant-garde art through sound (needless to say, I don't like it).<br />On Paul's side, he made many heartfelt and tuneful compositions such as the silly \\"Ob-la-di Ob-lad-da\\", \\"Martha My Dear\\" for his pet sheepdog, the Western-influenced ditty \\"Rocky Raccoon\\", the short and lovely \\"I Will\\", the leisurely acoustic tracks \\"Mother Nature's Son\\" and \\"Blackbird\\" where you'll get floored by the intricate guitarwork, and the cloying '20's pastiche of \\"Honey Pie\\".  But Paul wrote some fantastic rock numbers like the raucuous \\"Back In The USSR\\", \\"Birthday\\" and the head-banging (yeah, it really is!) \\"Helter Skelter', perhaps to prove that he wasn't just all ballads and \\"nursery rhymes\\".<br />The growing tension between the band's two chief songwriters at least paved the way for George Harrison to shine as a singer-songwriter,and it shows on the four songs he wrote--the dark-humored satire of \\"Piggies\\", the dreamy \\"Long Long Long\\", the witty comestible lyrics of \\"Savoy Truffle\\", and probably his finest moment (other than \\"Something\\", which is on \\"Abbey Road\\"), \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\", whose searing lead guitars were played by George's friend, Eric Clapton.<br />The record also features Ringo Starr's first composition, another Western-influenced song called \\"Don't Pass Me By\\".  He also sang the string-and-choir-laden closer \\"Goodnight\\", actually written by John.  At once, producer George Martin wasn't pleased with the decision of a double-album and had a particular dislike to \\"Goodnight\\" and \\"Revolution 9\\".  He vainly pleaded the Beatles (especially John and Paul)  to drop the double-album idea and instead take the fourteen best tracks to be put out in a single disc, like \\"Revolver\\" which also features different musical styles.  The Beatles declined (thankfully).   At least, all four were united on that.<br />As it shows, \\"The White Album\\" is an interesting mixed bag of styles, pretty much like \\"Revolver\\" (which is my all-time favorite Beatles album, by the way).  But the difference is, there's noticeably a feeling of distance while you're listening to these songs, and in retrospect you'll know that the Beatles' relationship was to go downhill (\\"...It was just Paul and a backing group, George and a backing group, and me with a backing group.  Although I personally enjoyed it at the time, that's really when we broke up,\\"  John once said).  It may not be as forward and experimental as \\"Sgt. Pepper's\\" or \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\" nor does it have any cohesive qualities than their later album \\"Abbey Road\\" does, but \\"The White Album\\" still came out strong, and it is a bit surprising (to me at least) that the Beatles managed to make decent music even in the midst of their growing conflicts against each other.
B000002IGV|4.0|Many a Metal fan in the 1980s would tell anyone who would listen that all Glam Metal was for poseurs and any one of hundreds of different synonyms for homosexual. Glam Metal was for poodle haired cross dressers more interested in make up and picking up chicks than making music with any redeeming value whatsoever. By and large, this was true. Witness for example the excesses of Motley Crue, the effete foppery of Poison, the commercialised Pop/Rock of Bon Jovi, and the failings of any one of a number of other bands, like Faster Pussycat, Tiger Tailz, LA Guns, Bang Tango, Great White, Ratt, ad infinitum.<br />Occasionally though, a Glam Metal band managed to produce an album masculine enough to appeal to True Metal fans. WASP managed it with two or three albums, and Motley Crue almost achieved it with the rough and ready \\"Girls Girls Girls\\". \\"Stay Hungry\\" by Twisted Sister was another of these albums, and by far and away the most successful.<br />Pre-dating the decadence of the LA Glam Metal scene by a good few years, Twisted Sister moulded the hard rocking theatrics of Kiss and Alice Cooper to their own shape. While many bands forgot to learn the basics, like playing instruments and writing songs, with Twisted Sister, the music always came first. The outrageous image was merely a marketing tool. Iron Maiden were also wearing multi-coloured Spandex in 1984, and no one was questioning their musical validity.<br />\\"Stay Hungry\\" will always be best remembered for the two huge singles it spawned, and their hilarious accompanying videos. `We're Not Gonna Take It' and `I Wanna Rock' are both lowest common denominator shout along anthems of simplistic teen rebellion at it's basest level, but damn it, they are just so addictive, and the fun factor negates their obvious commercial intentions.<br />If you look past the singles though, the rest of the album is reasonably dark. You thought Glam Metal was all about partying and chicks and lightweight throwaway Rock n Roll? Think again. Some of the riffs would have done Judas Priest proud at the time. And while some blame Glam Metal for the eventual decline of the solo because the guitar players were not technically proficient enough, don't point fingers at Twisted Sister- try Mick Marrs and CC De Ville.<br />The most obvious starting point is the creepy double shot of `Horror-Teria'. First up, `Captain Howdy' explores the psyche of a deranged child killer, not unlike Freddy Krueger. \\"You think you're going home to your own little bed/ But that's impossible, you can't sleep when you're dead\\". Captain Howdy was caught and tried for his crimes, but wasn't convicted, so a lynch mob formed and meted out `Street Justice'. \\"Now before you shake your head/ Think if it was your child instead\\". While not the deepest, most meaningful pair of songs ever, would any of Twisted Sister's contemporaries have stopped thinking about their dicks long enough to produce songs like these?<br />`Burn In Hell', `The Beast', `Don't Let Me Down' and `The Price also have negative lyrical themes, exploring where things and people fit in the world. `Burn In Hell' and `The Beast' would not seem out of place on a traditional Metal album, while `The Price' is an Ozzy-esque power ballad. <br />Although not the heaviest album ever, look carefully in the hidden corners of many a Metal fan's collection and you might just find the familiar picture of Dee Snider feasting on a bone. \\"Stay Hungry\\" was perhaps the greatest entry-level Metal album of the early 1980s, and deservedly so.
B00001U0DP|5.0|When I watched Life Is Beautiful I wasn't at all impressed - at 1st I wasn't. Not until the scene where Guido is forced to pretend to be a fascist leader indoctrinating children at the school (where the woman he loves is teacher). My stomach turned in this scene. And the whole meaning of the movie came to me like an avalanche. Guido's pretending symbolized many things. That when people are put in inhumane situations they will be forced to find ways to \\"work around\\" the situation in order to survive (for instance...I'm sure that the slaves that built the pyramids laughed & joked about their inhumane situation & about the ones in power in order to make life bearable...forced to be a slave but also forced to find a way to make life more humane when a humane life simply should be a given). Though he thought he was being clever in speaking in the way he thought the leader of the fascist movement would speak he unwittingly hit the nail on the head - Guido used the same words the real fascist leader would use but from a different point-of-view. Though Guido was innocent of the far-reaching implications of fascism he knew, on some level, what the policies were (enough to be able to pretend to be the leader that was suppose to be there instead). His playful speech is in actuality the same speech the leader would make but from different angles: Guido's own angle is one of joking disbelief regarding the philosophies of facism; the fascist leader (when he arrives) would say exactly the same words but said in total & unwavering belief in the fascist's philosophy. If you can imagine the real fascist leader in that classroom making that speech instead of Guido you'll see what I see. <BR>Guido using the horse that was painted green as a symbol against Jews is something we all do - we joke & laugh off insane political philosophies but we can only do that for so long because they simply can gain power & control that will turn everyone's life upside down (as shown in this movie).  I'msure, in that time, there were people brave enough to use facist symbols as a joke & to ridicule facist beliefs. Benigni showed that brilliantly in that scene. <BR>This movie also revealed that parents basically have no idea what their children are being taught (well back then I think that was the case). Benigni included that scene for that reason - children were being taught facism. His playful pursuit of his love to the school allowed that subtle implication to be included in the movie without hitting everyone over the head with that fact. The teachers standing meekly by while Guido made his speech symbolized how people can really be oblivious to a dangerous philosophy. I'm sure most people couldn't imagine how something like facism could nearly destroy the world. That's what the teachers symbolized to me.<BR>The whole beginning of the movie hit me like a ton of rocks after the schoolroom scene (this explains the beginning of the movie). That life is made up with many chances & sometimes coincidences & even unbearable situations all at once. Though chance & coincidences can bring joy in our lives (Guido meeting the \\"princess\\" all by chance for the very 1st time) chance can bring a lot of misery too (facism growing & becoming extremely powerful by strokes of chances & coincidences). That with enough \\"chances\\" & \\"coincidences\\" situations (good or bad) will grow & take hold (Guido constantly running into the schoolteacher by coincidences & chance allowed their love to grow...I think he was telling us that is how facism grew which is all by chances & coincidences...enough of these 2 things & you may have something dangerous OR something wonderful depending on the situation).<BR>On many levels Benigni showed how something like facism can grow out of control in the real world. The beginning of the movie people live their lives as they see fit (Guido going where the wind blows in trying to win the teacher's heart). Then a new philosophy seeps over the horizon but no onereally pays attention (the schoolroom scene...Guido joked but was oblivious to the implications that facism had if it ever had real power & many followers). Some people will make political satire out of this new idea (Guido on the green horse). If the new philosophy gains power it will benefit a person's life or interfere with their life depending on who you are OR who they say you are (Guido's store failing because of the new policies and because the policies doomed him & his family). And eventually total control over everyone's life & sometimes to the extreme in which it's decided who lives & who dies (the concentration camps). <BR>I was rather startled by the very simple ending with Joshua being reunited with his mother. All I can say is that Benigni understands human nature very well - people will continue to live their lives & history will repeat itself. He doesn't show an end to facism but possibly the beginning of more if people don't try to come out of their shells & try to make a difference. A simple ending yet a powerful statement. Perhaps he also wanted to say that some people remained unchanged by tragedy because most people just want to live no matter what happened in the past or what may happen in the future. It seems that he wanted to show that though there are some things that our beyond our control happiness & love are never beyond our control.<BR>I won't touch on the heart-wrenching scenes of the concentration camp. I wanted to reveal all the other parts that have been missed (or maybe they have not been missed...I'm just guessing here) From what I've read just about everyone has criticized the beginning of the movie which was in fact a reality check - things can creep into your life without being noticed until it's too late. And that's what happened in the beginning of the movie - facism showed up here & there in different scenes but always in a subtle & an unthreatening way like in real life. I'm sure, at the time, most people didn't feel facismwas a threat (political parties & philosophies live & die time all the time). The most horrific fact is that no one really knows what are the real intentions of this type of philosophy until they actually have power. <BR>Bravo Benigni. Your movie is pure genius. And the most humane movie I've ever seen.
B000002UDB|5.0|If anyone has anything bad to say about this album, then their tongue with which they taste music would be missing taste buds.  This 11-track album is a mind-altering experience, starting out with the all-around fun Magical Mystery Tour and the beautiful Fool on the Hill, and ending with a flourish, the inspiring All you Need is Love. In between there is the nonsense phycadelia song, I am the Walrus, and many others. If I had to pick the weakest song, iit would have to be from another album from another band, as this one is a masterpiece. If you liked Sgt Pepper, then you'll eat this one up. Of course, there could be no better endorsement than from John Lennon, who said it was the best Beatles album. It truly is a magical mystery.
B0001ADAVK|3.0|3 stars for three reasons: Maggie Gyllenhaal, Julia Stiles, and Marcia Gay Harden. (I loved Topher Grace's appearance too, but there wasn't enough of him to warrant 4 stars.) What about Julia Roberts, you ask? Well, Julia Roberts is a great actress, no doubt about it. But she just didn't fit the role. Another reviewer said it well -- she's just too modern to be in a movie taking place in the '50s.<br />Roberts plays Katherine Watson, a pre-feminism feminist who goes to Welsley College as an art history teacher, hoping to make a difference in the young women's lives. During her stay at the school, a few students stand out in her class -- Elizabeth Warren (Kirsten Dunst), Joan Brandwyn (Julia Stiles), Giselle Levy (Maggie Gyllenhaal), and Connie Baker (Gennifer Goodwin). The movie focuses on these five women -- Elizabeth's struggle to be the perfect 1950s housewife, despite her husband's lack of interest in being her husband; Joan's dilemma about whether to attend Yale University or marry her boyfriend (Topher Grace); Giselle's struggle with her reputation, as well as harboring feelings for a professor; Connie's struggle to, well, to love herself; and Katherine's struggle to bring the young women around to her feminist point of view.<br />The problem with this movie is that, apart from being cliched, Katherine Watson is not a very likeable person. She constantly tries to force others into her way of thinking, particularly Joan. Joan makes a decision in the movie that shocks Katherine,  who does not for a second consider that maybe Joan's choice was what made her happy. Add Katherine's completely unconvincing romance with a fellow teacher (the same object of Giselle's affections) and you have a boring, unlikeable central character.<br />However, some of the students are very engaging and likeable. Elizabeth makes a startling transformation by the end that is actuall quite believable. Giselle -- well, she's played by Maggie Gyllenhaal, who is emerging as one of the bestyoung actresses in Hollywood. This alone will make you like her character, but Giselle in her own right is a good person who is just lonely. Connie is the most endearing character -- you can't help but root for her. Joan is one you can respect, and she is played by the very respectable Julia Stulies. In all, the students were much better characters than Katherine.<br />However, there is one as-yet-unmentioned character -- that of Katherine's housemate, Nancy Abbey, played by Marcia Gay Harden. Nancy is a great character -- graceless, yet sympathetic, enshrouded in such a cloud of sadness that we wonder throughout the movie if she might be a bit mad. Marcia Gay Harden is absolutely terrific in this movie, and outshone Julia Roberts in every scene they appeared in together.<br />This movie is certainly not innovative or clever, and as I've stated several times, the central character is not very endearing. However, it does have its feel-good moments, and the young actresses are outstanding. Recommended if there's nothing better on. You probably won't wonder in horror where your last two hours went, but you certainly won't be thinking about it for long after the movie ends.
0312305060|5.0|This is the story of three women in three different time periods, Cunningham does a wonderful job in demonstrating the connections between these women. The story is simply about the dissapointments of life and how we cope. Cunningham is a great author and I strongly recommend his other books, Flesh and Blood and A Home at the End of the World.
B000053VAF|5.0|Some find it odd that some one of my most oft-repeated sayings when discussing religion in serious conversations comes from a Kevin Smith movie -- \\"I think it's better to have ideas. You can change an idea. Changing a belief is trickier.\\" But I think that that line alone made this movie more than just a screwball comedy, controversial for the sake of being controversial. \\"Dogma\\" has some actual messages to get across, and it just happens to do it in a much more enjoyable way than, say, \\"The Passion.\\"<br />The movie follows a disillusioned Catholic woman (Linda Fiorentino) on her journey, ordered by Metadron (Alan Rickman), to stop two fallen angels (Ben Affleck and Matt Damon) from reentering heaven, thus rendering God's word reversible and ending the world as we know it. Along the way, she encounters workers of God, prophets, and the missing thirteenth apostle (Chris Rock, my favorite part of the movie). I'm not going to reveal any more of the plot, except to say that Alanis Morissette makes a pretty unexpected (and funny, when you consider the absurdity of it) appearance.<br />The great thing about \\"Dogma\\" is that it always seems to know exactly what it's doing. There's parts when it's supposed to be screwball humor (which is most of it), and parts when it's supposed to be more serious. It blends these two perfectly together, and the result makes you laugh and think at the same time. Truthfully, not many movies can do that. Sure, some may watch it only for the appearance of Kevin Smith regulars Jay and Silent Bob (Jason Mewes and Smith himself, respectively) but if you look deeper, there's some real substance to this movie. It's not a bashing of the Catholic church; it's simply a movie that reminds you to ask questions. Highly recommended unless you're an easily offended Catholic.
B0001I55OC|4.0|I read the book and loved it.  The movie was pretty faithful to the book, but left out some details.  This is not really a star-packed film, but when I saw it, I fell in love with Gerard Butler and his sexy Scottish accent.<br />That alone made it worth buying for me.
0141439831|5.0|As Thackeray's Vanity Fair was my first serious foray into 19th century british literature, I found it a bit daunting at first. After I acquired a rhythm for his style of writing, I quickly lost myself in the story. Never before had I read a book where so much attention was paid to detail. Everything is described eloquently. The story itself is hilarious and heartbreaking at the same time. After finishing the book, I have forced many of my friends and family to sit down and read it. They too love it, and are recommending it to their friends.
B00008973A|3.0|While I can understand the need for space and time in a movie, the two new songs, Richie's &quot;Surprise&quot; &amp; Cassie's &quot;Let me dance for you,&quot; are both fascinating and reveal to us something more about their characters.  It was good that part of the excessively long montage went away, though they should not have left out Richie's previous part, in which he reveals that his athletic skills give him a scholarship to college in which he intends to become a kindergarten teacher, until he realizes that &quot;Nobody's going to be standing there with no scholarship to life&quot; and selects dancing instead.<br />  But Cassie's distracting subplot gets in the way a bit.  It would have been better to have Cassie appear twice, singing both her original &quot;Music &amp; the mirror&quot; (and emotionally stronger song) earlier, getting tossed out, then returning later to sing &quot;Let me dance for you.&quot;<br />  In addition, Kristine's song, &quot;Sing,&quot; reveals more about this pathetic bride whom we know or care nothing about in the movie.  Her husband (and assistant in the song) is more powerful, but he too suffers from losing all importance to the plot.<br />  Beyond this, the character of Connie is completely ignored.  She didn't even get a song, nor much to say.  She could at least have helped out a bit with Diana's &quot;Nothing.&quot;<br />  That's it.  My tirade is over.  I like the film, but I could bear to watch a further half-hour to include more for these characters.
B0000524CY|5.0|It is easy to banter around a movie as being the scariest ever made.  Buy this movie actually lives up to the billing and should give shivers up one's spine unless one is already dead.  The soundtrack is outstanding in setting the mood of the scenes.  I saw the original movie when it first came out (amidst the tremendous controversy) and found it gripping.  Of the added scenes, I will agree that the change to the ending was unnecessary.  In the years since it was made, it has lost none of it's punch and is a very powerful and well crafted movie.  My first DVD had to be replaced (it contained blank portions while the sound continued)and the replacement sometimes did not want to load.  But once the movie started, it is one of the best to put one on edge.  Sometimes, the medical scenes were more chilling than the possession scenes.<BR>The cardboard DVD case, however, merits a thumbs down from me.
B0002858YS|3.0|The CD is OK, not the greatest. The songs are all hit and miss and the songs that miss are boring and all sound like the same song in different ways with similar instrumentals. Songs 1-4, 7, and 10 are great and worth a listen but the rest of the CD is a cliché. The sophmore effort should hopefully improve on this band full of potential. <br />1. Jenny was a friend of mine-  8/10  Very Good Instrumental; original. Excellent chorus but the verses are kind of boring <br />2. Mr Brightside- 9/10  Amazing song, good instrumental and very well done but the same verses are used twice instead of being re-written with different words, leaves little replay value<br />3. Smile like you mean it- 9/10   Great song with a perfect chorus. Brandon Flowers on the synthesizer really makes the song, very good for such a young band.<br />4. Somebody Told Me- 10/10- Carefree song with excellent lyrics. Best Song on this CD.<br />5. All These Things That I've Done- 5/10   Brutal beginning that is extremely boring. Song picks up and has a random but good bridge with a gospel choir that makes this song worth a listen.<br />6. Andy, You're a star- 3/10   Not anything special, the gospel returns again but is not anywhere near as effective this time. The song never picks up and drags along for a painfully long 3 minutes<br />7. On Top- 8/10 Another well written; original song. one of the best on the cd. <br />8. Change Your Mind- 4/10 The lyrics to the song are great but the way they are sung makes the song fall short of greatness. Like numbers 4 and 5 it becomes very boring and drags on.<br />9. Believe Me NAtalie- 2/10 Same as 4,5,8, very repetitive and pointless<br />10. Midnight show- 8/10. Pretty good song. Dave Keuning does a great job on the guitar and brandon flowers has great vocals in this song.<br />11. Everything Will Be Alright-1/10 The beginning sounds like it is the background music to a low-budget horror flick. The song picks up....a little but is rather pointless.
1576751988|4.0|This book isn't a new take on time management or efficiency. Instead, Brian Tracy, a man who's own success speaks pretty loudly, takes some of the best wisdom out there on the topic and puts it in a compelling form. This is important beacuse time management is about more than having the right information - it's about putting that information into action. Tracy puts the same message of prioitization and focus in front of you in a form that challenges you to take action. Highly reccomended, but you have to be willing to use this book, not just read it!
B00000583F|4.0|I've heard a lot about this album from many websites how it's \\"the most influential stoner metal album next to Kyuss and Monster Magnet\\" etc. Well, I don't think it's the best, but it's a good album anyway. Sleep is pretty much what would happen if Black Sabbath stopped writing epic songs with keyboards (I'm talking about the majority of Sabbath, Bloody Sabbath) and got back to their roots. Sleep also can jam like the best of them. Matt Pike, while a little flashy on solos, has great rythym and unleashes some fine riffs throughout the album. Al Cisneros, who must have studied under Geezer Butler, is great on bass and can sing quite well (When he wants to. The Druid and Under The Sun have this weird scream thing that's a little annoying, but he sings for the most of the album). And Chris Haikus is a very good drummer who does some interesting fills. The songs are good too. Dragonaut has one of the best riffs of all time, Aquarian is a good song with a great vibe to it. The best is From Beyond, which has some excellent riffs, and some cool jamming. The reason I gave it 4 stars is that the production isn't that great. It's a little buried at times, but that's nothing a Bose can't handle. Good stuff if you're looking for early doom or are a big Sabbath fan.
B0001IN07Q|5.0|This CD plus DVD is reasonably great. It gives you different versions of what michael have done. <BR>  One may wonder why the evaluation varies so greatly people either love it or hate it. Well, I would say, the &quot;concert&quot; DVD is not meant to be listen as if you were in a concert hall but as a showcase of many facets of michael. It's so great to be seeing him as a real person, talking to you and in the meanwhile listeing to samples of his songs.<BR>   So, don't complain that you can have a frame stay steady for three minutes, because it never meant to be so. It is only that this style is not your cup of tea.<BR>   Besides, there are a track in DVD that show steady shot on michael sings many of his songs-- that part is great too and like a chamber concert.<BR>   Last but not least, about his style similar to Frank Siniatra and Elvis etc. Well, no body sing like no one sing before. Similarity is unavoidable. Art is in the sublty. If you can find the distinct subtle difference between michael and those past great singers, I can only say sorry for your ear and taste.<BR>   Basically, this album is for those who are more interested in Michael the person, in addition to his songs.
0743454529|5.0|My Sister's Keeper is such a moving book because it is told from the point of view of each of the characters involved.  The author allows the reader to not only develop emotions and opinions towards each character, but then challenges those opinions with testimonies from other characters.  Although this book may be praised for the accuracy and precision of the medical details involved, this is not the main strength of the piece.  This story brings the reader into the world of Anna's family and allows the reader to experience all of the sorrow, anger, resentment, and eventually peace that occur when a loved one is afflicted with a terminal illness.  Legal and ethical issues are also explored, yet the author allows the reader to come to their own moral conclusion.  I would recommend this book to anyone but would also advise the reader to read it a second time to fully understand the spectrum and depth of each character.
B00003CXI1|5.0|This was the first installment of the Harry Potter series; it all depended on the actors and the filming. All in all, I think that they did an awesome job. From Harry's Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon all the way up to the scenery, they did a good job doing what the movie was made to do: Stay true to the book and provide a great movie. My only complaint was that Albus Dumbledore didn't have a great show of character. He played the role all right, yeah, but he didn't expand it to improve the role. Well, I guess you can't have everything you want in life but this about has it all: Two thumbs-up for Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone!
B00028HBKM|5.0|THIS MOVIE MADE ME CRY ALL 5 TIMES I WENT TO THE THEATER TO LOOK AT IT. IT WAS REALLY OVERWHELMING SEEING WHAT JESUS CHRIST HAD TO DO FOR OUR SINS. I GIVE THIS MOVIE A 5 STAR RATING. HIGHLY RECOMMEND TO EVERYONE.
B00008DDXC|4.0|This movie was definately a great work of theatre and art alike. The entire movie was captivating, and while the director, Christopher Columbus, could of done better on some parts, this movie does what most do not, and it stayed true to the book. I loved this, and I watched it about 3 times before I was satisfied with it! Go get the movie and see it, and you'll see what I mean!!! The scenes with the Chammber of Secrets were beautifully detailed, giving you a clearer picture than even the book did! So buy this, sit back and be amazed by the production of Harry Potter's second year at Hogwarts school of Withcraft and Wizardry! Enjoy!
B0001GOH6Q|3.0|Is there something I was supposed to take away from this movie? Okay, it was different and caught my interest, and well-played by the actors. It is about a son who is trying to figure out who his father really is after years of tall tales and fantastic stories. But at the end of the movie I was left wondering okay, now what? What did the son realize? Is this supposed to tell me something about life or relationships? What was the point?
B000000H7I|5.0|I will say his with ABSOLUTE CONFIDENCE THERE WILL NEVER EVER BE A GREATER BAND THAN SUFFOCATION.Crimson thorn,vital remains,decapitated nile etc are nothing to this band and thats a FACT.
B000002KOQ|5.0|Apart from BLUE, most of the people who know the music of Joni Mitchell appreciate, above all, COURT AND SPARK (1974) and HEJIRA (1976). I won't blame it on them - those are beautiful, elegant albums. Nevertheless, I consider the trilogy formed by LADIES OF THE CANYON (1970), BLUE (1971) and FOR THE ROSES (1972), one of the finest works in pop music. The first chapter, released in April of 1970, is a group of songs written between 1966 and 1969. It is for this reason that the LP is like a summary, a compound of the best pieces she has written up to then. The lyrics go from the intimistic tone to protest and accuse, to just simply storytelling. &quot;Willy&quot; forewarns the tones of BLUE - it's a beautiful song about inadequacy in a relationship, in which is clearly perceptible a sense of impotence even in front of an immense love that makes her feel &quot;like a shiny light breaking in a storm&quot;. Or &quot;Conversation&quot;, in which she plays the part of someone's lover's lover and she's so in love that makes you feel in love too. On the other hand, songs like &quot;The Arrangement&quot; and &quot;Big Yellow Taxi&quot; develope a clear accuse against modern life abuses and consumer mentality. Together with these are some lyrics that remind the ones belonging to her first two albums, such as &quot;Morning Morgantown&quot; - which is obviously connected with &quot;Chelsea Morning&quot;, in CLOUDS (1969). <BR>For what the music is concerned, it's a great step forward in Mitchell's growth as a musician; while her first two albums were based quite exclusively on acoustic guitar, for the first time here we can hear not only the piano - an instrumet which Joni wouldn't play for a long time - but also percussions, a jazzy clarinet (on the final notes of &quot;For Free&quot;), a sax, a flute and a cello. <BR>So, to conclude, Joni paints stories and personal feelings with a taste of free innocence. Maybe the best thing about this album is just that it is open, free. Itrepresents the most sincere and deep expression of her thoughts. Hence, the reason why I consider LADIES OF THE CANYON her best album is because there's a variety of themes and tones that you can't find in her other works, neither in BLUE, nor in COURT AND SPARK, nor in HEJIRA.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|I am absolutely confused at how some of you people actually have the nerve to say that this album isn't \\"music\\" and rate it with one star. Now, in all honesty, I am a music lover, but I tend to lean towards pop, hip hop, and r&b, and have never really been an Avril fan.  After hearing \\"Don't Tell Me\\" though, and liking it, I decided to go out and buy the album, and surprisingly enough, I love it.  <br />You know, I really wish that album reviews weren't scattered with awful reviews from people who simply hate the artist and haven't actually listened to the music.  They are everywhere.  People who hate Britney, Christina, Missy Elliott, Brandy, Monica.  Come on people, this isn't some stupid childish competition.  Please Rate the music.<br />My favorite song on this album would actually be the first track, \\"Take Me Away.\\"  I absolutely love it. The album really doesn't have one bad track.
0792164903|5.0|In the trend of other Tim Burton films, the complextion of the film is creamy, and satisfying.  It tells the common veiwer about Sleepy Hollow, yet puts new tantalizing details in the middle of well known scenes.  It finally answers the reader of Washington Irving's book where this terror came from, and why it hunts and why it is indeed \\"headless\\".  The cast is believable, yet the only weak point is Christina Ricci, who seems to be trying to hard to pull off her role.  The cinematography is brilliant, something only Tim could do.  It becomes dark at the right moments, and is bright and sugar-sweet when it tells the back story of Johnny Depp's mother, and once again is dark as it learns her fate.  This film is not only wonderfully thrilling, but comedic in points where you would think it couldn't. Shall I say, they involve blood squirting, staining, spraying and squirting some more.  Johnny Depp is a wonderful pick for this movie, as he gives us exactly what we want from anyone playing Ichabod Crane, plus a little bit more.  Have fun, yet do not laugh for too long, or it will surprise with it's random and scary turns.
B00005AAFS|5.0|I do not know where to start. There is not a single bad track on the entire album.<BR>The first thing you will notice when you listen to Rammstein's \\"Mutter\\" is the outstanding musical discipline used to achieve an incredibly \\"tight\\" and ammaculate sound.<BR>Mutter is also very melodic. Every song has a definable theme, rather than just a messy sounding jumble of guitars, bass, keyboard and drums.<BR>I might also mention that this is Rammstein's first album to include orchestral strings sections.<br />[1]MEIN HERZ BRENNT (My Heart Burns): What an opening. The strings provide a deeply cinematic feel, as lead singer Till Lindemann opens with \\"Nun lieber Kinder, gebt fein acht\\", translating to \\"Now dear children, pay attention...\\". The strings deeper sections come in before bursting into guitars and drums, while the strings, still playing, perform an series of fast scales, coinciding with Rammstein's familiar industrial-sound. This contrast works remarkably well.<br />[2] LINKS 2 3 4 (Left 2 3 4): The political song of the album, contradicting claims that the are supporters of the Right Wing, or Nazism (The title represents a march). The guitars provide a surprisingly catchy theme and, in my opinion, is one of the most energetic songs on the album.<br />[3] SONNE (Sun): Rammstein created a guitar riff with this song that always makes me think \\"why hasn't this been done before?\\" A beautiful sampling of a wailing choir is heard towards the end, as \\"the world counts loudly to ten...\\", and the strong vocals emphasize the song just that much more. Wow.<br />[4]: ICH WILL (I Want): The song that got me into Rammstein. Within 20 seconds of hearing this song, I decided to buy all their albums! And I am very picky about music! Prior to hearing this, only classical was for me. The guitars and keyboard work together producing a monstrous, but obviously melodic sound.<br />[5]: FEUER FREI! (Open Fire!): Ok, a calm synth sound. Sounds quie nice I suppose, then, holy crap, KA-BOOM!The guitars, bass and keyboard hit you so fast, you really need to be aware of when it will arrive! Im my opinion, the \\"messiest\\" song of the album, but even so retains it's clean and \\"compact\\" sound.<br />[6]: MUTTER (Mother): The album song. Beautiful, anthem like guitar theme, different from any other song on the album. This song, like Mein Herz Brennt, includes the orchestra and creates a very powerful song. Right towards the end of the sogn Till's voice fades in before hitting the final chorus and ending with \\"Mother! Oh give me strength\\".<br />[7]: SPIELUHR (Music box): A very story-like song. Opens with just Till's voice. One can visualise him reciting a fairy-tale to children. An awesome chorus, very expansive-sounding. Also includes another odd combination of guitars and music box and sounds really, quite wonderful.<br />[8]: ZWITTER (Hermaphrodite): Now we reach the more sinister of songs. This song has one of my favourite choruses and has downright hilarious lyrics. I suggest you check them out!<br />[9]: REIN RAUS (In Out): As can be guessed by the ever-so-subtle title, this is a song about sex. Understandably, people might be turned off by this, yet I find the composition so damn awesome! Right towards the end a frentic keyboard section flies up and down various scales performing loops and such creating a bizarre \\"circus effect\\"! Just perfect!<br />[10]: ADIOS (Goodbye): Yes, this is Spanish and was dedicated to a drug addict (I forget his name). Great guitar solo (I'm using these \\"great\\" adjectives a lot, I know...), and great chorus. Great great great!<br />[11]: NEBEL (Mist): Quite possibly my favourite song of all time. If you get the chance to hear this, please excuse the rather slow introduction and give it a chance. The song is about a man's last few moments with the girl he loves before she passes away. Set on a beach, the chorus sings \\"And then he kissed her, where the sea ends...\\". Don't mistake this for another cheesy pop song, please.<br />After the first few verses, the drums come in, as though you are expecting the guitars. Instead, what you get is lush, astonishingly beautiful strings flooding everything out. A cymbal clash concludes the string's part and back to the verse. If the chorus doesn't move you, the concluding words to the song will, as the it ends amidst a dissonant clash of strings and keyboard, and then resting on a long orchestral note. It ends, just as it begin. Beautifully.<br />So there you have it. Any industrial metal band that can successfully pull off a romantic song without being cheesy is a worthy band. And that is Rammstein.

0061008079|5.0|A Woman of Substance is the story of Emma Harte, an English woman who starts life out in poverty-like conditions and rises above it to become one of the richest women in the world.  The story starts out in New York in 1968 where the reader is introduced to Emma and her granddaughter Paula.  It then progresses to England in the current day (1968) where Emma settles down to do some family business.  The book then goes back to Emma's childhood in England in the early 1900's.  Emma is a maid at Fairley Hall, a job she hates but must perform to help the family finances.  Something then happens that causes Emma to have to leave home and fend for herself.  Being a strong person she doesn't dwell in self-pity.  Instead she uses her mind and her natural talent at business to start the store that will later turn into a major empire.<br />A Woman of Substance is a well-written book.  I must agree with other reviewers that the first part is a bit confusing and doesn't really do much except to set up the scene to take the reader back into Emma's childhood to see her rise to fortune.  I honestly didn't think I would like this book during Part 1 but kept reading.  Ultimately I was glad I didn't give up on this book as it is extremely entertaining and well worth the time to read.  There are a lot of characters in the book to keep straight.  Once figured out though the characters all have an important part in the book.<br />I can't say enough about this wonderful book.  It is just brilliant.  It has everything from poverty to fortune, love to hatred, revenge, friendship, laughter, tears.  Every emotion possible is revealed during the 900 plus pages of this book.<br />A Woman of Substance is a must read book.  Definitely a book to put on the keeper shelf to revisit in the future.
B00008EY65|5.0|If you are on the fence about seeing this movie, let me recommend seeing this highly.  I am an avid movie watcher, and comic book reader, however I have never read a hellboy comic in my life, so I went into this movie with no pre-conceived notions of what to expect.  I was a little hesitant, because of the directors previous effort \\"Blade II\\".  I enjoyed that movie somewhat, but it just wasn't great for me.  So needless to say, I really didn't think this movie would be all that.  But I was pleasantly surprised.  The effects were amazing, the story was great and the actors did a superb job.  Ron Perlman was fantastic.  I was little hesitant about the fact of him having the lead role, I just didn't think he was that strong of an actor (sorry Ron), but he fit this character like a glove, he was awesome.  The other characters were great and the casting was well done.  The character interaction in this movie was interesting and fun.  This was just a fun sci-fi/action flick that kept me 100% entertained the entire time.  I doubt you'll come away thinking this movie is oscar-worthy or anything, but I think most people out there will find it quite enjoyable.  You will hear over and over comic afficionados bashing this movie for not being true to the comic books, but I loved it.  Not only is it a great movie, but this DVD supposedly has tons of little \\"goodies\\" and extra features, that definitely makes buying this DVD worthwhile.

B000002J0B|5.0|This is definately one of the best albums of the best band in history. There are no bad songs, and every song is very cool in its own different way.<br />1. The Song Remains The Same - 4/5: Some people love this hard rock song, but I personally find it rather boring. The guitar riff is kind of boring, and the song just isn't really that great compared to the rest.<br />2. The Rain Song - 4/5: This is a very good Led Zeppelin song. This song is a very beautiful ballad, and even though it isn't really my type of Zep song, it is still very good.<br />3. Over The Hills And Far Away - 5/5: Definately one of Led Zeppelin's best songs. It starts off as a quiet acoustic song and works its way into a hard rocker.<br />4. The Crunge - 4.5/5: A very unusual Zeppelin song, it is basically a parody of James Brown. It's quite entertaining and I especially like the end.<br />5. Dancing Days 4.5/5: A very hard rocking song, even for Led Zeppelin. It is quite good and I find it much more interesting than the first number.<br />6. D'yer Mak'er - 5/5: This is another very unusual Led Zeppelin song. It is a sort of rock/reggae fusion and is basically a parody of 50's rock. Despite its oddness, it is still very good.<br />7. No Quarter - 5/5: Despite what many of people say, this is a very good song, quite possibly my favourite Led Zeppelin song. It is a sort of blues/prog-rock fusion and sounds somewhat like Pink Floyd. It is a very eerie song with an excellent guitar riff from Jimmy Page. <br />8. The Ocean - 5/5: A straight up rocker, this song is very good. In league with other classics such as Black Dog and Rock And Roll, it is definately one of the best Led Zeppelin rockers.<br />This is definately a very good album from a very good band. Along with Led Zeppelin IV, this is probably my favourite album of all time.
B0000057C5|5.0|I've heard that &quot;Du Hast&quot; translates to &quot;You Hate&quot;.<br />IT DOESN'T!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />If you listen to the record, he says &quot;Du, Du hast.  Du, du hast, du hast mich.  Du hast mich gefragt, und ich hab nichts gesagt&quot;.  For those out there that don't speak German, it means &quot;You, you have.  You, you have, you have me.  You have me asked, and I have nothing said&quot;.  Put in a complete sentence, it means &quot;You asked me, and I said nothing.&quot;  He's asking a question, past-tense you ignorant idiots!  Learn something about the language before you make a ham-fisted attempt to translate it.  If it were meant to mean &quot;You Hate&quot;, it would be &quot;Du Hasst&quot;.  Big difference.<br />I've studied German now for 4 years.  I'm not freakin' wrong.<br />The whole song is a play on German wedding vows.  The verses are saying &quot;Do you want to be faithful to her until death?&quot; and instead of saying &quot;Ja&quot; (yes for those of you who are clueless about other cultures) he says &quot;Nein!&quot; (no).  The rest of the album is as good as &quot;Du Hast&quot;, but (thankfully) much less misunderstood.
B00000099Y|5.0|To all of you trying to categorize, analyze or understand tool in a general way, you are missing the point. Tool is such a personal band that you cannot have one general feeling about them. some find them too dark, some too hard some too mellow. I feel bad that they are letting this art blow right by their slow minds. The question is how does this band make you feel? I have never understood these guys jumping in tool concerts, or those meat heads, or those new age religious freaks claiming to be spiritually connected. just look at the unique feelings these songs can pull out of you, the state of mind they put you in. your mood changes with the song, your heartbeat changes, you discover something new each time you hear it. I have owned this CD since it's first release, never once did I play it and not enjoy it, or not feel my emotions captured by the subtle flow of their music. let them grow on you, play this cd and close your eyes, the music is so strong that it will fill your body, and capture all your senses. I consider myself lucky to be able to understand them to this extent, I hope many people understand what I am talking about. to all you airhead yuppies, you don't need drugs to feel what I'm talking about.
B0000584V3|5.0|I have owned this album for about a year now, and I think I've finally got a handle on just how good this is.  This isn't a one-time listen album to fully understand.  You need to listen to it several times to really grasp just how far-reaching, intelligent, innovative, heavy, and just plain good this album is.  <br />Mikael Akerfelt (I think that's how you spell the lead singer's name) is one of the best vocalists in all of metal music, regardless of subgenre.  He can peel paint off the wall with his throat shredding wail and he can also floor you with melody and a truly beautiful singing voice, as evidenced by &quot;Dirge for November&quot;.  His musical arrangements are so complicated and textured that I still can't pick apart each layer.  The texture of the music creates a very dark musical atmosphere.  It almost gives the impression of being in a sparse forest, at night, in the winter.  When I listen to Blackwater Park, I actually start to feel cold.  It's eerie as hell.<br />To review:  Blackwater Park = best heavy record ever, Mikael Akerfelt = brilliant.  Buy this album already!
B000148KK2|1.0|Diana must be sleeping in the other room. This CD is weak and not pleasurable at all. Diana you should sing BOSSA NOVA. Bossa Nova fits better to your voice. Listen to Bebel Gilberto and you will see what music is about. So ZERO STAR and try to make it better next time. I have anything else to say!!!!
0385510438|1.0|Wow, was this book bad.  I've read just about every Grisham novel, and while some have been good and some a little weak, this one was clearly the worst.  For one thing, you could have easily cut out 80% of the pages to tell the &quot;thriller&quot; part of the story.  I understand that isn't the whole thing the book is supposed to be about, but you literally at times wonder if that story is ever going to get told.  There are SO many instances where Grisham wanders off on a tangent for NO REASON relevant to the story.  Why do we have to hear all about Grisham's enlightened views on the Vietnam war through the eyes of a main character back in the 70's.  It has NO bearing on any aspect of the story.  Its just odd, unrelated filler.  Same goes for an investigation and cataloging of all the southern churches and their basic tenets.  Its always good to learn something in a fiction novel, but that &quot;something&quot; should be in the course of telling the story, not oddly jammed in with no relevance except to fill pages.<br />And, its not as if waiting around for the ending was worth it either.  It is dull and disappointing.  Which is a pretty good summary of the whole book.  If you are looking for a more entertaining page-turner this summer, try something from Brad Meltzer, like The Zero Game or The Millionaires.
0385504209|1.0|Mr. Brown's wonder work \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" suceeds in diluting true Christianity in the most subtle and not so subtle ways. On literary merit alone it is average. Most people love a good conspiracy theory and well liberal Hollywood loves it... because it does what they love, undermines the truth and historical facts of Jesus Christ.<br /><br />Liberal Hollywood hated seeing the \\"Passion of the Christ\\" and despised the accuracy of it, but they devour the \\"Da Vinci\\"<br /><br /> If you are interested in truth I would recommend another more fascinating, compelling and honest book, that IS worthy of its' best-seller status...the Bible
B00000AFGM|5.0|This is undoubtably the best Marilyn Manson cd ever released. Sure it might not be as dark and heavy as his other albums, but it makes up for that in other ways. The fact that this album is on the lighter side actually creates an interesting deviation from Manson's earlier (and later) work. This quality makes \\"Mechanical Animals\\" more approachable to a wider audience, especially those who aren't into \\"heavy\\" music. Don't be fooled though, as this album is more than capable of packing a punch, and the adult themes that Manson is (in)famous for, can still be found throughout the cd. A good way to describe this cd, would be glam rock/metal. It is more upbeat than previous and latter albums, and has a different vibe overall. With awesome singles like \\"The Dope Show,\\" \\"I Don't Like the Drugs,\\" \\"Rock is Dead,\\" and best of all \\"Coma White,\\" this is a must have cd for both Manson fans, and those who enjoy rock and metal. BUY IT NOW!
B0002234LS|4.0|If anyone less than the inestimable Johnny Depp were to have been cast in this dreary, more-or-less predictable psycho-thriller (adapted from the novella by the Master of More-Or-Less Preditcable Psycho-Thrillers, Stephen King) this film would have sunk deep into the abyss along with the rest of the barely-digestable popcorn horror flicks from the last few years. Mr. Depp's trademark quirkiness (imagine a more accessible, but no less hilarious version of Ichabod Crane in modern-day rural New York) is slightly more evident than usual, and his knack for subtlety is brought right to the foreground quite often, and very wisely so, by writer/director David Koepp. <br />What prevents this movie from really taking off, aside from the inherant problems with the storyline itself, is also the fault of the director: as a writer, Mr. Koepp has been plagued by his apparent penchant for eye-rolling cliches and tinny dialogue, and there is certainly enough of that in 'Secret Window'. (For further evidence, remove the action from the first SpiderMan film and you have little more than a terrible soap opera, which is kind of redundant if you think about it.) As a director, though, he is far more refined and creative, though there are several times during 'Secret Window'  when you can't help but ask yourself why certain moments, and even entire scenes, were included at all. <br />The overall look of the film is very sleek, but not exceptionally stylish or unique, outside of a few very cool sweeping and rolling camera shots. Also giving aide to this particular cause is an exceptional score by composer Philip Glass, who serves up easily one of the finest scores ever composed for a horror film, ranking right up there with John William's score for 'The Fury' and Jerry Goldsmith's efforts on 'The Omen' and 'Poltergeist'. It's a pity that no soundtrack album was produced. <br />On the other hand, the one MAJOR downfall of this film comes courtesy of one of the most bone-headed casting decisions I've ever seen: giving the role of the 'romantic' foil to Timothy Hutton. Who in their right mind would leave Johnny Depp for Timothy Hutton? Every time you see Mr. Hutton's rumpled face, you can't help but think 'what on earth was she thinking, and who are they trying to fool?' Fortunately, those moments are few and far between, and ultimately they get discarded because this IS Mr. Depp's film, first and foremost. Mort Rainy will likely go down as one of the most indellible cinematic creations of all time, standing proudly alongside the afore mentioned Ichabod Crane, Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood, and Jack Sparrow. CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow, excuse me. A pretty impressive list of immaculate film characters for a man without an Oscar and only one nomination. Fortunately, we have Willy Wonka and J.M. Barrie to look foreward to in the near future. In the meanwhile, this little morality play is certainly a nice diversion and pretty darn entertaining.
0380733358|4.0|Rating System:<br />1 star = abysmal; some books deserve to be forgotten<br />2 star = poor; a total waste of time<br />3 star = good; worth the effort<br />4 star = very good; what writing should be<br />5 star = fantastic; must own it and share it with others<br />EYE OF THE NEEDLE by Ken Follet<br />STORY: WWII rages throughout Europe. The infamous German spy, De Needle, attempts to stay one step ahead of the MI6 agents on his tail. It quickly becomes a race to stop the German spy from revealing the truth about the upcoming Allied invasion.<br />MY FEEDBACK:<br />1) CHARACTERS &iexcl;V nice backgrounds and motivations given and the players in the story stay true to character. Characters are believable because we&iexcl;¦ve all known people like them&iexcl;Kwell maybe not like De Needle. º  You cheer for the good guys and hate it when the bad guy succeeds, which is exactly what an author wants to accomplish in his writing. I appreciated that the &iexcl;§good guys&iexcl;¨ were not made out to be complete idiots and actually had some great intuition in trying to capture the bad guy.<br />2) SETTING &iexcl;V I&iexcl;¦ve never been to England but I&iexcl;¦ve seen plenty of movies that take place there. I think the author uses these preconceived ideas and already established visuals to help the reader know where the character is. Otherwise, when you look at it closely, I felt that he didn&iexcl;¦t spend a lot of time giving us environmental descriptions&iexcl;Ksome readers will find this a pleasing aspect while others may want more.<br />3) STORY &iexcl;V For the longest time I couldn&iexcl;¦t figure out what the purpose of the &iexcl;§sub-plot&iexcl;¨ of Lucy and David was all about and how it tied into the main storyline. But it was brought around nicely. Nice suspense and the last 50 pages are great wrap up.<br />4) MISC &iexcl;V There is one love scene that is VERY descriptive and may be offensive to some readers...but luckily it is only one and doesn&iexcl;¦t carry on for too long. The book generated an overall bond with me that now I&iexcl;¦m off to watch the Donald Sutherland movie version of the book.<br />OVERALL &iexcl;V Fast, easy read that brings suspense and concern for the well being of the characters. Worth getting!y on for too long.

B000002UDB|5.0|&quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot; was released as an EP (extended play) recording in the U.K. in late 1967.  This CD was put together by the kind people at Capitol Records, who butchered most of the Beatles' British albums when they were released in the U.S.<br />Capitol actually does a pretty nice job of putting the &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot; songs in the first half (everything up to &quot;I Am the Walrus&quot;), and giving us a second half of Beatles singles releases which hadn't appeared on an album as of late 1967.  <br />Although &quot;Magical Mystery Tour,&quot; after thirty-seven years, comes off looking more and more like a vanity project of Paul's, the music to the film stills holds up quite well.<br />I remember reading an interview with George Harrison where he was asked who he thought was the best lyricist in rock 'n' roll.  George said it was Bob Dylan, giving the interviewer a casual apology on behalf of John Lennon, who George always respected.  I mention this because &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot; has two of John's best songs on it- &quot;I Am the Walrus&quot; and &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever.&quot;  Dylan once told the Stones that he could've written &quot;Satisfaction,&quot; but they NEVER could've written &quot;Like a Rolling Stone.&quot;  I assert that Dylan NEVER could've written &quot;I Am the Walrus&quot; or &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever.&quot;  Lennon, at his best, was the most lyrically inventive and the most introspective songwriter in all of rock music. <BR>Although Dylan wins the songwriting competition hands down by the size of his catalog and his longevity, John, in these two songs, explored areas of the imagination in which he was the master.
0062502182|2.0|If nothing else, The Alchemist provided stimulation for me to search out more authentic sources on the topics it endeavored to explore (Buddhist philosophy, Arabian desert lifestyle, Christianity, etc). And because it WAS a source of stimulation, and because I could not allow myself to group it with the 1-starred Stephen King or Danielle Steele 'novels', I give Coelho 2 stars for his effort.<br /><br />Basically, this is a simple story of a man on a journey through Arabian deserts; on his way he meets mystics, women, takes up odd jobs in glass blowing, cares for sheep, and goes on other such soul searching quests. Supposedly by the end of his adventurous journey (which leads him to a \\"treasure\\") he 'learns'/attains the meaning of life.<br /><br />I do believe Coelho was a little theologically confused at the time he wrote this story. His main messages are:<br />\\"Follow your heart\\", and \\"Learn the Language of The World\\"; but, Coehlo and his main character are Christians; the boy travels through a (mainly) Muslim land, and though he ends up at the Egyptian pyramids, while the preachings seem to be quite \\"eastern\\" in take (buddha comes to mind). But since the whole essence of Eastern philosophies lies in that they cannot be described in words, Coelho's explicitness reeks (He constantly preaches about how things cannot be told, they must be experienced).<br /><br />The language is quite simple, which can be beautiful (read: Herman Hesse); however it comes off as quite redundant and sermonic. Every other sentence contains at least one reference to either \\"The Soul of the World\\", or \\"The Personal Legend\\", or \\"Follow Your Heart\\" with a big fat capital H. By the end of the novel I am skimming most passages.<br /><br />The characters are flat (I didn't really \\"feel\\" them, what they were going through, and there was no character development), and the storyline resembled that of a children's folktale (I like folktales).<br /><br />Overall, it was a worthwhile read given that it only took a couple hours, presented some interesting ideas (albeit, without illustrating any of them satisfactorily), and removed me to the Spanish countryside/Arabian desert for a bit (I am a sucker for folktales, and if this book is nothing else, it would make a lovely illustrated children's book).interesting ideas (albeit, without illustrating any of them satisfactorily), and removed me to the Spanish countryside/Arabian desert for a bit (I am a sucker for folktales, and if this book is nothing else, it would make a lovely illustrated children's book).
B000002JSN|5.0|My first double CD version of Physical Graffiti was back in the late 80s and it wasn't great.  So this is miles ahead in terms of clarity and brightness.  But the essential balance of the mix stays the same.<br /><br />At a time when interest in Zep remains at a high, fans want more.  With each successive re-release and remaster, they're still not quite getting the holy grail, if that's what they're after.  Most buyers I imagine have already bought one or two or more of the previous editions - whether vinyl, CD release, cassette.  That's pretty much the standard by which the new deluxe reissues are being seen from - are they really better?  Do they offer a lot more?  Is it worth one's money?  Should anyone care?  Led Zeppelin fans know the band's output inside and out - and that is the standard that Jimmy Page has to hold these releases to.  So far despite the hype and the packaging, he appears to have exercised a great deal of restraint on the most important aspect: the music.<br /><br />What made Physical Graffiti a departure was the sheer amount of material the band had to tap from - from their earlier 1972 Stargroves sessions to 1974, when the band was rapidly evolving. This remains a great snapshot of the post-blues Zeppelin: the band that was creating their own sound further away from their blues covers and adaptations.  The rehearsal bootlegs of this remain the most extensive collection of outtakes and early versions - and that is what hardcore fans like myself were banking on.  The period in which the band was drawing these recordings from spanned over 2 years so logically, we expect more.<br /><br />The entire remastering exercise has become a Jimmy Page project and he has held his own view of what should be released - re-editing Whole Lotta Love from the Song Remains the Same.  Dropping encore tracks from How the West Was Won, etc.  The remixes honestly will not flip the way you've heard these.  But what IS worth listening to are the early versions of In the Light; the early mix of Houses of the Holy, and the instrumental jam of Sick Again.....three tracks in all, and why aren't there more?  Fans don't need a subtle remix of their favourite song - they want new or unheard versions of the tracks that offer something more warts and all.<br /><br />What I would like to hear is how Robert or JPJ might have remixed or approached their songs.  Robert has for instance remarked that he wishes Carouselambra (from In Through the Out Door) was mixed so his vocals were more audible since the lyrics were meaningful.  Through Jimmy's filter, we get some but not a hugely adventurous approach.<br /><br />My challenge to Jimmy is:  the tracks are out there.  The outtakes are out there.  The fans will find them.  Why not offer us a real look into the recording process or a more experiential feel of how Zep constructed its music.  Looks like Jimmy will remain restrained on this, and that's a shame.  There are so many other templates for this to follow - and that is what your fans deserve.  Not another remaster, remix, etc.<br /><br />Jimmy attempted it with CODA - which showed how patchy the approach could be, but it's still worthwhile if curated properly.<br /><br />On its own merits, this is a 5 star album.  On its extras, I give it 6 out of 10.  Get Brutal Artistry or other such compilations for a more complete experience.  Noel Gallagher put it best when he talked about Jimmy Page's current pursuit.  Let's see what's next, but the well is running dry....<br /><br />PS My original generic review below<br /><br />A DESTROYER OF AN ALBUM<br />Still at the creative peak of their powers, Zeppelin unleashed Physical Graffiti - a double set that truly encompassed everything that the band had done to date stylistically.  Continuing the trend of Houses of the Holy (and in fact, featuring tracks recorded from those sessions) - Physical Graffiti seemed to delve into almost every rock style available to the band's arsenal from blues to hard rock to rockabilly to folk to middle eastern to funk to just Zep.<br />Highly original, highly inspiring and highly recommended.highly inspiring and highly recommended.
B000002UUX|5.0|For me personally, Megadeth was the premier thrash band. Metallica had nothing on former Metallica's guitarist Dave Mustaine and his band. Unlike Metallica, Megadeth managed to put out consistently good music. I am not really into speed metal (which is ironic since I love industrial music) but Megadeth was the band that I really got into. &quot;Rust in Peace&quot; made me a fan. I don't remember what compelled me to buy the album but I sure got an earful. It was heavy and intense. Fourteen years later, &quot;Rust in Peace&quot; still holds up well given the current circumstances of our country's foreign policies. Dave Mustaine didn't write your average angst-ridden lyrics. He delved into government conspiracies like &quot;Hangar 18&quot; and the notion of the government hiding UFOs out in Nevada. Dave and Marty Friedman's breakneck guitar playing complimented each other very well. Dave Ellefson is one of my favorite bassists of all time. He and (former) drummer Nick Menza gives the band the backbone the band needed. All the songs are great but I particularly am a big fan of the first two singles &quot;Holy Wars...&quot; and &quot;Hangar 18&quot;. The music videos for those songs were excellent. That was when artists and bands made good, quality videos. Megadeth was one of those bands whose videos were always entertaining even if they were concert footage they still were good. For me, &quot;Rust in Peace&quot; is Megadeth's best album. It isn't stupid metal like Limp Bizkit or Korn whose buffoonery and whining gets on my last nerves.
B000002JSJ|3.0|After the pomp and power, came Presence in 1976.  The high flying Zeppelin had become a mortal band, and this is reflected in Presence.  The album would signal the end of an era and the start of their last chapter.  The band had ended a long tour and Plant had survived a car crash with bad injuries.  They would never be the same again.<br /><br />For what it's worth, Presence is a straightforward, unadorned album with mostly spare guitar riffs and subdued vocals.  Plant's voice had come down to what would be his normal range - his shrieking had vanished and he was singing in a wheelchair.<br /><br />Most of the album feels like a jam session - as opposed to Zep's previous crafted albums.  The masterwork \\"Achilles' Last Stand\\" is the one sprawling ambitious exception.  Then rechanneling the blues, Plant ekes out \\"Nobody's Fault but Mine.\\" Both tracks feature incredible drumming by the late John Bonham (so much so that Metallica would acknowledge the influence of Achilles). \\"For your Life\\" is another great Zep track and sums up the band's tone at the time.<br /><br />Jimmy Page has always said that Presence was his greatest achievement - if only for his physical work on it - a whirlwind music and mastering session, but it is not Zep's greatest piece.  People seeking the same dynamic Zep experience as their previous 6 albums should really look elsewhere first.<br /><br />For the uninitiated, Presence will be a shocker.  Mainly for Plant's less-than-stellar vocal range.  For the fans, this album gets better with time.
0140380221|5.0|Oooh, I have for years wanted to read Little Women by Louisa May Alcott, and I finally got the chance. This book is so amazing, you actually learn to love each one of the characters, yes, even that selfish and smoiled 'Lady' Amy March. The story focuses on four charming yound ladies, Margaret 'Meg', Josephine 'Jo', Elizabeth, 'Beth' (Who by the way is my favorite) and Amy March, these girls are tought several and important lessons, some softly and some a little more harshly by one of their greatest teachers, their mother, Mrs. March, called sweetly by the girls as \\"Marmee\\". <br />The story begins, slowly and happily in what seems like a perfect world, even if Father is away at war. The sisters make new friends, attend elegant parties, and each find small adventures of their own, at home, at school and everywhere. Of course, things change, dark days come along, Meg is falling in love with Mr. Brooke, Laurie's (The Marches' neighboor) tutor and Jo fears that her sister might soon leave them, and poor shy, sweet Beth gets the scarlet fever, who at the end has very serious and sad consequences.<br />There are happy and sad moments in this wonderful masterpiece, and I recommend anyone to read and enjoy them as much as I did.
B000002JSR|3.0|The problem with CODA was that the collection felt like outtakes when it was released. The re-assessment of Zeppelin has made many of CODA's tracks more appreciated.  Still, the main problem with CODA isn't so much with the individual songs -it's with the mix.<br />The songs here just don't sound as good as they should because it's so assorted.  To fully appreciate these tracks, buy Zep's 4 CD Remasters set.  Somehow the magic of Zeppelin isn't captured here, except with &quot;I Can't Quit You Babe&quot; - an edited version from the Albert Hall concert in 1970.<br />Only hardcore Zep fans should get this...
B000003TA4|2.0|Whoever commented that Nirvana aren't played on MTV and aren't marketed in Hot Topic obviously hasn't surfed the MTV channel or stepped foot in Hot Topic. MTV plays Nirvana every day that I've clicked on the channel recently, and they religiously air their pathetic Kurt Cobain tributes every few months where kids talk about how his suicide supposedly prevented theirs. But most of all, MTV sponsored and endorsed the Nirvana Unplugged in New York performance that you so dearly love. Don't bite the hand that feeds you, little girl. Plus, MTV hyped Nirvana's inflated, phony Rock-God status by being the first and only channel at the time to play Smells Like Teen Spirit every hour of every day, seven days a week. Without MTV, there would never have been a Nirvana after their SubPop days. The channel made Nirvana the hideous corporate monster-disguised-as-punk act they became. Oh, and Hot Topic sells Nirvana T-shirts for over twenty bucks a pop, and has Magik RPG cards featuring the band. Isn't that sickeningly-corporate enough for you? Oh well, you give those corporations your hard-earned allowance anyway, so you must not care!
B0001ZX0PG|4.0|Okay, the story is great, the acting is great, but the dialogues are very vague like a sort of &quot;word-potpourri.&quot;<br />I also didn't like the filming angles. I don't know much about filming but I do know that good camerawork can make or break a movie. I thougt it was rather dull. I also find it very blasé that you see a sort of tunnel of light when Dave gets killed (much too sci-fi for this movie).<br />And don't even get me started about the music! Clint Eastwood should keep himself busy with directing and not with anything he doesn't know anything about. The music was VERY repetative and very bad. It gave the movie a very cheap aura and is not what it deserved. The music reminded me of some cheap B-movie, where some dumb*ss composer sits behind his computer and mixes some flimflams untill he produces a sound diarrhoea. <br />But the story and acting is so good, I'll still give it 4 stars.
0385504209|4.0|&quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot; is an excellent thriller that reads very quickly.  It basically tells the story of a symbologist who is lead through a series of challenges given to him by a dead man while trying to avoid the police and other parties that want what he is trying to find.<br />This book was a very entertaining read.  While it is technically a fiction piece, it uses a lot of facts and stories to really engross the reader.  Many past reviewers have actually not liked this style of writing, but I believe it is because they were looking for a totally factual story and did not buy into the world created by the author.  This belief, even if it goes against what your general belief system, must be suspended at least while you are reading the story.<br />This book is very exciting and entertaining.  It begins with a lot of action and it carries through all the way to the end.  Most books have slow sections, but this one had few, if any.  The plot was well-thought out and the ending was not very predictable.<br />In the end, I would recommend this book to anyone that loves a fast-paced thriller and is willing to suspend &quot;what they think they know&quot; for a short time.  It's an exciting world the author has created and if you truly buy into it, it's a great book.  Otherwise, you'll just be scoffing at some of the ideas presented and fail to truly enjoy the book's intent.

B000002LJA|5.0|I was thrilled to get the cd so quickly and it was in great shape.  I would definitely order from this seller again.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I have every single one of Britney's cd's but this is the one that makes the most sense. She's talking about more than &quot;Clueless-esque&quot; realationships with boys. This her most mature album yet. Though the album offers a slight turn-off with tracks like &quot;Brave New Girl,&quot;and &quot;Early Mornin`&quot; all in all the album is great. I definetly reccomend this cd to everyone. It's not Oops I Did It Again again folks. This album is completly diferent from the other 3. People of all races can enjoy this cd. Best Songs-1,2,3,6,7,8,9,&amp;12.  Showdown, I got that boom boom, and outrageous are definetly 3 of my favorite songs.
0312263120|3.0|I had fun reading this book but it's definitely as good as his other three.  Wouldn't be suprised if some of the info was inaccurate also.  But, to the reviewier who nicked him for this, his other books aren't as accurate as you may think.  For example, in A&amp;D he says that protons and electrons are antiparticles, THEY ARE NOT!  The antiparticle to a proton is an anti-proton and the antiparticle of an electron is a positron.  I should think if protons and electrons were anti-paricles the would would be pretty unstable!  Anyway, my point is no techical fiction is ever really accurate and you're probably just noticing the problems in this book more than in A&amp;D for example because you're a software engineer...
B00004SCX6|5.0|Britney Spears made a bomb cd. I'll give a song to song review to explain:<br />Track 1- Oops...I Did It Again. Yes the song is un-belivably corny. But there's just something about it that keeps people singing it all day.<br />Track 2- Stronger. This song is ok. Very idependent.<br />Track 3- Don't Go Knocking On My Door. The hands down best song on the cd. This song has a little R&B mixed in it so it gives it an un-pop sound which makes it sooo much better. Too much pop can kill you.<br />Track 4- (I Can't Get No) Satisfction. This song is ok, but it's sort of lame and corny.<br />Track 5- Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know. How can you say she can't sing when you hear a song like this? This is one of the most beautiful songs on the cd and I love it to death. One of my top 5 favorite songs of all time. Sure kicks \\"The Beatles'\\" (...)!!!<br />Track 6- What You See (Is What You Get). Best pop song on the cd. Deals with real life issues and it a total \\"Shower Belter.\\"<br />Track 7- Lucky. I guess I can understand where she's coming from. She may be famous, but she a human being just like the rest of us entitled to her privacy and not to be judged. Just because she may wear (...)clothes sometimes doesn't mean she's a (...). None of us know her so no one can judge or defend her.<br />Track 8- One Kiss From You. Catchy song. Too much like Hit Me Baby...One More Time though.<br />Track 9- Where Are You Know. I love this song soooo much. It's really pretty and mellow and a great song to relax too. One of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard.<br />Track 10- Can't Make You Love Me. Pretty corny, but gets stuck in your head easily making it enjoyable.<br />Track 11- When Your Eyes Say It. Pretty corny at first but when you sit down and listen to it, it's really beautiful.<br />Track 12- Dear Diary. This is the most ridiculed song on the album, but I fall to pieces listening to it. It's sooooo much like what so many teen girls go through with boys, and when I sing it I feelevery single lyric in my heart. This is personally my favorite slow sng on the cd.<br />All in all Brit rox on this cd!!!!!
B00004X0Q0|5.0|For the reviewer Mitch, I too shared your opinion early on about this album. I got it in the midst of the Oned Armed Scissor hype that was starting to break them back in 2000. I didn't like it at first, thought it was all just agro garbage. <br />However, the more I delved into it, the more I saw the incredible musicality and the innovativeness that lurks in this piece of music gold. It is now one of my favorite albums that I own. This was an amazing band and Relationship of Command is a crowning hallmark to one of the greatest underground bands ever. If you don't like it at first, give it a few more listens and then it will start to blow your socks off.
B00005JMFQ|4.0|I have seen this movie twice.  Everything about the movie is perfect except the porn scenes with the two kids.  Now being a woman of 24 I found this scene to be alienating.  I get a little uncomfortable seeing women totally naked with my boyfriend who politely covers his eyes.  The story had a lot going on but I never found myself lost.  THe stories are plausible and real.  I just didn't get the whole porn story. Maybe it's me being insecure but I would have given it 5 stars if I could show the movie to kids or my parents without feeling a little silly. I love and adore this movie, so if your competely at peace with tastless nude scenes then you will fall in love with this movie and watch it everyday.
B000000WA4|5.0|This is definitely the best Smashing Pumpkins album for it's diversity.  I rarely find any album that I like from beginning to end, let alone two.  With Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness, Billy Corgan really showed his talent to the world.  He showed everyone what a fine and true talented artist he is.  <br />In this album there are really heavy songs like Tales of a Scorched Earth, X.Y.U., and An Ode To No One.  Really mellow songs like Galapogos, Cupid De Locke, and In The Arms of Sleep.  Alternative songs like 1979, really refined ones like Tonight, Tonight and Thirty-Three.  Other depressive songs like Where Boys Fear To Tread, and Bodies.  There's even a bit of electronics with Love, and really childish songs like Lily(My One And Only), By Starlight, and We Only Come Out At Night.  <br />This CD is a true masterpiece and one in it's kind.  If you don't have it already, go buy it now!
078681859X|5.0|What a wonderful book.  I couldn't put it down.  The two main characters are entertaining and complex.  It was interesting to watch their relationship develop.  I can't wait to read Book Two!  <br />My twelve year old son, who hates to read, reluctantly agreed to read this book.  He loves it and can't put it down!
B0001K9IJ8|2.0|Don't be misguided by my rating of this album. I encourage you to purchase EVERY album that Diana has ever made. I am a big fan of Diana Krall. Case in point- I traveled from the Cayman Islands via Australia, to see her perform in Toronto, Canada. (Check that out on your maps!) BUT... in my NOT so humble opinion, I feel that Diana would do better to make music with Joni Mitchell or the sort. Joni Mitchell good for Diana...Elvis Costello, well, we'll wait and see. I can only hope that this album is not a sign of what is in store for Diana and her music. I submit the following evidence- Listen to &quot;A Case of You&quot; from her album entitled &quot;Live In Paris&quot; Now listen to any of the 7 songs on this album that Elvis has credit to.- No Elvis, I DON&quot;T THINK SO! Mind you, this is not to be mistaken as a bad review on Elvis' music. I'll eat Ice-cream or Caviar.-Just not together.
B00004SCX6|3.0|That's the best I can describe Ms Spear's sophomore release. I absolutely LOVED 'Britney\\" so I decided to c heck out her first two albums which were not to my surprise not that good. Too many songs are forgettable.  The only ones I enjoyed are \\"Can't Make You Love Me\\", \\"Lucky\\", \\"Stronger\\" and the ballad \\"Where Are You Now.\\"  \\"Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know\\" sounds like a throwaway Shania Twain song, which ironically it is.  The edited chorus totally ruins the laughable R&B-wannabe \\"Don't Go Knockin On My Door.\\" I am also sick of hearing the title track for the umpth time. The horrid re-make of \\"Satisfaction\\" doesn't help either. If you want Britney Spears's best album, check out \\"Britney.\\" DEFINATELY her best. \\"Oops\\" is a little better than her disastrous debut but still very average.C-
B000294SFW|5.0|The new album of Mot&ouml;rhead once more proves the fact that Lemmy Kilmister is one of the major figures in the history of rock music. Having been around from 1960s onwards he has charisma unsurpassed by today's rock stars and an aura of evil god of rock'n'roll around himself. Godfather of speed- and trashmetal and the creator of legendary and much-imitated rock anthems like Ace of Spades, Overkill, Killed By Death and Born To Raise Hell, just to mention a few, shows by the new Mot&ouml;rhead album, that he still has the magic rock'n'roll formula in his possession.<br />Mot&ouml;rhead is truly unique music. It's an energetic, heavy and powerful mix of various styles including traditional heavy metal, speed and trash metal, blues, punk and even the really traditional 1950s rock'n'roll. Lemmy, a big fan of Buddy Holly, Elvis, Carl Perkins, Little Richard and other trad r'n'r and rockabilly, once said that MH basicly is a blues band, just louder, angrier and heavier, and it is a good description.<br />Inferno is at the same time very traditional and very multifaceted Mot&ouml;rhead record. You've got the traditional fast and heavy steam hammer tracks like Terminal Show, In The Name of Tragedy, Down on Me (except for the surprising chorus!), Killers and Fight very typical to the line-up Kilmister-Campbell-Dee, then Going to Brazil -style tracks mixing up heavy metal and rhythm'n'blues like Life's A Bitch and Smiling Like A Killer, but then also the sad but beatiful (especially the guitar solo) Keys To The Kingdom, and as a biggest surprise the ending track Whorehouse Blues, fully acoustic and 100 per cent traditional John Lee Hooker -style blues!<br />Inferno has all the elements from which great rock music is made.  This is Rock'n'Roll in the true sense of the word and with big capital R. It would be a mistake not to buy this, believe me.
1400034779|4.0|I had a good time reading this book, from page one right up until the end. Written in a simple style that evokes African fable, the book is episodic in construction, offering several different tales from Mma Ramotswe's casebook--tales that emphasize the culture in which she moves and the thoughtways of her fellow citizens with remarkable elegance. This delightful novel is set primarily in Botswana's capital city of Gaborone. This story follows the life of Mma. Precious Ramotswe as she sets up shop as the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency. Colorful, inspiring, and easy to read, this is one book you'll want to recommend to friends.  Also try The Bark of the Dogwood, Sam's Letters to Jennifer, and The Five People you Meet in Heaven.
B000002J09|5.0|To the people who gave this album bad reviews, do you play any instruments? Yeah didn't think so, Led Zeppelin was a band for people who love and appreaciate creative music. They are especially worshipped by real musicians because of their prowess on their instruments. I am a drummer and a guitarist and I must say Bonzo and Page are two of the most talented musicians I have ever heard. Although I admit they are probably not the best ever, they are definitely the best combination ever. Eddie Van Halen may be a better guitarist than Page (VERY DEBATABLE) but Bonzo could outdrum Alex any day of the week. These two musicians being in the same band is a sign that God truly exists. However even if you aren't a musician, if you have an open mind you will love this album. All the nu-metal people hate Stairway, but they are close-minded and only listen to anything with a blaring 200 BPM tempo. Just because it's soft doesn't mean it's not good. Stairway has the aura that no other song has been able to acheve. It is the closest thing to musical perfection that has ever been achieved to this day.  (Moonlight Sonata is a close second.) But anyway as long as you have an open mind, you will love this album.
B000274THQ|4.0|Even without the telltale subtitles, you can tell that \\"Goodbye Lenin\\" is not an American movie.  Why is that, you ask?  Because it can offer all the elements of good filmmaking:  storytelling, character development...of its general complexity without sacrificing values.<BR>    Values, you say?  Oh yeah--those quaint notions that inherently recognize right versus wrong and/or hold some old traditions near & dear.  Again, the inclusion of old-time verities tips one off that TimeWarner is not providing the funding for \\"Goodbye Lenin.\\"  In fact, TimeWarner types would not fit into the ouevre of the film at all.<BR>     To cut to the chase, the story follows the antics of a young son's attempts to cover up the 1989 breakup of the GDR to his ailing mother.  Residents of East Berlin, the son's mother--an ardent communist--emerges from a coma;  doctors warn her children, though, that any shock or upset could bring on a fatal heart attack.<BR>    Knowing too well the cultural havoc that rampant post-1989 Westernism has created over the former GDR, the son goes to great comedic lengths to recreate pre-1989 Berlin in their tiny apartment in Alexanderplatz.<BR>     Which is yet another way \\"GL\\" cannot be mistaken for mass-produced American sap:  it can manage to be a comedy, a complex political questions and a brave champion of Olde World values.  And all at the same time!<BR>     Its refreshing to see the son's devotion to his mother, respect for familial ties and tradition.  All Americans should be made to watch \\"GL:\\"  to see the ugliness of our popular culture firsthand as it makes its brash way into the GDR.  Coke banners, pornography, rap music, Britney...<BR>     Unlike those American movies that do make the attempt to formulate a message (which are becoming rarer by the day!), this film doesn't hit you over the head to get you to see the deleterious effects of western imperialism and crass consumerism. The movie's producers simply do this through their characters:  a daughter who works at the new Burger King;  Denis, the eager aspiring movie director who provides much of the comic relief in this film.<BR>     Although he may not be crazy about Lenin's theories and living under the communist regime, the son has enough depth of character to acknowledge and appreciate his mother's years of devotion to The Cause.  But this is where the predictability ends in \\"GL>\\"  Now usher in the disturbing and unexplained fact that his father was persecuted by authorities for not joining the Party and hence defected to West Berlin.  Is this why his wife was such a devoted worker in The Party?<BR>     This could have been fleshed out more, just as the \\"Wessie-ness\\" (western Berlin manners and mores) of his sister's boyfriend, Rainer.  The film has other shortcomings:  the relationship between the son and his mother's nurse is too sappy and predictable (\\"American-like, you could say).<BR>     Some may view his efforts is recreating a pre-1989 life for his mother too farfetched for reality:  think of the pickle scenes.  The director's use of fast-forwarding for many of the comic scenes are hilarious and accentuate their absurdity.<BR>     Actual footage from the crumbling of the Berlin Wall is interspersed thru the film as well as newsrells of political leaders.  I found it interesting that no images were shown of former President Reagan (or any other American officials for that matter).<BR>   The scene with the disembodied Lenin flying over Alexanderplatz, waving goodbye to the mother, is SUBLIME. <BR>    It doesn't get any better than this!
B00005JKZV|2.0|A cynic is what an idealist calls a realist. So, after reading this review, please do not call me a cynic.<BR>First of all, one needs to be sympathetic with the film-maker. 'The Two Towers' is the second part of the trilogy- stuck in the middle- neither here nor there. Hence, a lot needed to be done to make the film gripping. However, the only highlight is the battle at Helm's Deep, which, at best, can be called good. Gandalf's return as the White Wizard was fun to watch. However, trying to enjoy the rest of the film is in itself a battle- a losing one. A long, dreary 3-hour torcher is what this film boils down to. Pardon me for being harsh, but I cannot help compare it to its predecessor, which was nothing short of a masterpiece! 'The Fellowship Of The Ring' was a complete film- complete in the sense that it left one satisfied. It had the calm, serene and beautiful Shire on one hand and the dark and dreadful Mines of Moria on the other. Several scenes in it left one gaping. Nothing of the sort is found in this film.<BR>Having said that, one has to realise that the book(the original story) itself might not have permitted extravagance.<BR>So, if you want to enjoy a good film with astounding effects, do not go in for this film. However, if you want to complete the trilogy, then do, by all means, watch 'The Two Towers'. Don't let the link go missing. But, please, do NOT even dream of comparing it to either its presecessor or its successor- which are in a league of their own.
B00005RHGK|4.0|This is a movie you should watch at least twice. Not even because you will be dying to watch it again immidiately, but because you'll need to prepare for what is to come.<BR>The filmmakers did their best effort not to reveal at first what kind of creature we're dealing with. So you start watching a very creepy beginning, in all daylight, not knowing what's chasing the siblings. It has a lot of suspence and in the first half an hour, it will creep you out. At this point you'll think you're dealing with a murderer, but then, surprise, it suddely turns out to be a monster!<br />That was the filmmakers' surprise. but i don't think that was the right appraoch. After being creeped out for half the movie, it is just a terrible dissapointment to see the monsters face, and it will ruin the rest of the movie.<br />Then watch it again, and you'll see: if you know you're about to watch a monster movie, and you know what the monster looks like, you can value the rest of the atmosphere, and will notice there is still a lot of suspence left.<br />I think this is one of the best horror movies made lately, and evrybody should give it a chance.
B000066NW0|1.0|I trust that all of the people under me are under the age of 13 because as I see it these people have the I.Q. equivalent of a puppy.  As the title above me says, ironically, I skateboard.  I love skateboarding and as the masses and their ignorant selves decide to flock to it for their own greedy uses, I get sick.  People like Avril Lavigne should be tortured ala Abu Gharib style.  Music has now been sunk to the point where stereotypes and sex sell.  And what better way than using a young girl who is a \\"sk8ter punk\\".  I applaud the Matrix for crafting pop songs for a puppet and showing the world that you don't need talent to make it big (also see most female popstars 80-04 i.e. Kylie Monogue).  If you have any sense of pop music then listen to the Velvet Underground's Loaded, or the Flaming Lips to truly understand music with catchy riffs and good song writing.
B0001L3MI0|4.0|This is easily my alltime favourite alien-invasion-movie. Besides the normal screaming and running, it contains some great realistic portraits of humankind. Compared to a so called 'intelligent'movie like signs, i thought this could actaully happen. In Signs, they think logical behaviour is locking yourself in the basement and be so lucky that aliens don't know how to open doors. In Independence day, people are plundering eachothers houses, starting fights, getting all in the same traffic jam... Of course, there are always those superheroes, one of the strong type and the more intelligent type, but Jeff Goldblum is always terrific to watch. On the whole, this is a pretty intelligent movie with some realistic aspects and also just great special effects, can't wait to see The day after tomorrow.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|I'd heard a lot about this film from my friends; many of the recommended it as 'some surreal, weird stuff!' whereas others said it had great underlying meaning to it, and the acting was superb.<BR>I finally gave in a couple of weeks ago, and decided to give it a watch.<BR>I am not a real fan of surreal work, or pretentious art or directing, but this film was exceptional.<BR>The acting was brilliant, the casting perfect, the directing excellent, and the surreal moments beautifully created. Not to mention the giant metallic rabbit, who, for some strange reason, managed to look ridiculous while frightening simultaniously!<BR>The story is as follows: a young man miraculously escapes death when he is drawn away from his bed by a rabbit-like creature, who tells him the world is going to end. While away conversing with this...'being', a jet from an aeroplane falls from the sky and desimates the guy's room.<BR>As the film progresses we being to get inside the mind of a man who could be thought as crazy, misunderstood, psychotic, schitzophrenic...who knows? Yet with the help of his girlfriend and a recluse physics teacher, the fate of the world lies in his hands.<BR>The film is a non-stop rollar-coaster ride of psychological exploration, romance and fear; which comes to a dramatic climax and an incredibly intelligent end.<br />A superb film, and one which I can't reccomend enough
1592400876|5.0|Two Pandas walk into a bar . . . okay, not really.  If you haven't read enough reviews yet to know the &quot;panda&quot; story, please peruse until you find it--quite funny and makes an excellent point. Tis a rare thing for someone to be able to educated us AND make us laugh at the same time--my favorite type of education, by the way. Hence my glee at finding this stellar little book that does just exactly that. When I first saw this book advertised, I thought, &quot;Groan. Here's another academic and boring book on punctuation or the lack thereof.&quot; I ran screaming from the room each time an advertisement popped up or someone recommended the thing. And what's this title about? Some guy that eats something, shoots a basketball, and leaves? I was totally in the dark. Then I took the time to read the description---this after seeing the incredible ranking that the good people of Amazon have bestowed upon this literary creation---and my eyes were opened. This is one funny book! Not at all what I expected. And in the process, you actually learn something. Hopefully this will help those of us out there who are punctuation deficient, and be funny to those who aren't. Would also recommend to really great reads (and from what I could tell, both of these were punctuation savvy and up to snuff)---one is a book titled &quot;The Birth of Venus&quot; and the other is one called &quot;The Bark of the Dogwood.&quot; Both seem to have all their &quot;i's&quot; crossed and &quot;t's&quot; dotted . . . or, whatever . . . Listen, I'm still working on it. Okay? God, I'm terrified of what I've done &quot;punctuationally&quot; with this paragraph. Mea culpa . . .
B00005JKCH|3.0|With this, you get what you'd expect. Violence, cliches catchphrases, excellent special effects and a tenuous storyline!<BR>Fortunately however, the action scenes are slick; the characters well cast (special mention to Defoe, who makes an exceptional insane bad-guy!) and the dialogue fairly slick. The film is fast-paced, and though not deep, insightful (or indeed meaningful!), is distinctly enjoyable. Maguire makes a brave attempt at being the genetically altered Peter Parker, called upon by his sense of moral justice to clear up the city after his Uncle is killed by a robber.<BR>Dunst puts in an average performance as his beautiful girl-friend (who somehow manages to not notice the similarities between one of her best friends and the web-slinging superhero!).<BR>The film offers what we need sometimes in a world obsessed by introspection and pretention: some light relief. Some fairly good acting, well coreographed fight scenes and a pleasant all round film.<BR>I find myself awaiting the next film with a certain amount of anticipation!
1592400876|2.0|If you've read the summary above, you know the panda joke which inspired the title. If you paid attention in school, you know the basic rules of punctuation.  If you get out of the house much, you know that these rules of punctuation are often ignored, sometimes to humorous effect.  Oh, and if you've ever been across &quot;the pond&quot;, you know that the rules of usage and punctuation are somewhat different there.<br />So, if you want to spend a couple of hours reading lots of examples, some humorous, of how punctuation has been misused, you will certainly enjoy this book.  But if you're literate enough to be at this site, you probably won't learn much.  Any reader is also strongly cautioned that the book does not adhere to the conventions used in the US. (And words, for that matter, as you will probably need a British dictionary for definitions of some of the words!)<br />In sum, if you enjoy feeling superior to those who just can't seem to get punctuation right, have a great time, but you'll be better off with a standard style book for actual usage tips.
B00005JLXE|2.0|This was clearly a counter-product of Spiderman. Hollywood sees the sucess of a super-hero film, why not shove another down the public's throat?<BR>This film lacked the storyline, slick coreography and indeed general direction of Spiderman. In an attempt to depict another kind of hero: the dark, brooding hero who gets swift and brutal justice, the director failed to give the film any heart, or audience appeal<BR>Only a few things saved my from giving this film a single-star rating:<br />1) The soundtrack was picked excellently, with great contributions from Evanescence and The Calling<br />2) The acting talent was far superior to Spiderman (special mention to Affleck - a superb performance, and Matthew Clarke Duncan as the evil Kingpin.<BR>However, it must be said the Garner (though undeniably similar to the cartoon character, beautiful and seemingly deadly), just doesn't manage to shine in this film<br />A film to watch if nothing else is really available. There aer some moments when the director really seem to get things right, and the actors really bond together well, but those moments are few and far between. Thus this is another film which can be thrown to Hollywood Hell, leaving only the vague happiness of some good acting action, and leaving the vague worry or an even poorer sequel.
B000002H2Z|4.0|Wow, hard to believe. I grew up with this album.<br />The new album &quot;The Cure&quot; has me breaking out my Cure collection. This album is a masterpiece of pop songcraft, and still has enough of an edge to keep it intriguing all these years. The production sounds a bit dated and tinny, but that should be fixed real soon as The Cure get ready to release the re-masters later in 2004. <br />There's not a bad song on this album. It's a great place to start if you are interested in getting into The Cure. This is the album that they splashed big with in the US. Then you could work your way backwards and forwards to fill in the gaps. I would give it 5 stars, if not for what was to come in the future...
B00008NG5V|5.0|this cd is mello and relaxed but at the same time it is interesting and ear catching and it is great for repeated listening. it has a simplistic style that cannot be touched is is by far the greatest thing i have heard in a long time.<BR>im going to go see them in tahoe in august and i can not wait!!!
B000068TPN|1.0|Regardless of its inherent historical authenticity, this is bar-none one of the WORST war films I've ever seen. Sure, Ia Drang happened. Yep, it happened like this, and ya, the guys all wore these uniforms. And that's where it ends.<BR>Everything else about this movie is hokey, flag-waving, crass Americanism at it's burger-munching worst! Mel Gibson, strutting about John Wayne style through artillery barrages - puhlease! And let's not forget neophyte \\"lifer\\" sidekick wannabee officer who eats it heroically - barfbag please... And finally, how about those syrupy-sweet, and likewise sickly simpering war-wives left back home. Never have I been subjected to such a barrage of base emotional manipulation. Indeed, I found myself wishing all these Yanks would die! What a putrid piece of garbage filled from top to bottom with every dead war movie cliche in the hollywood dust bin. Don't waste a nickel on this pure, unadulterated tripe. Of course, if you buy into the lies of American war \\"heroism\\" you'll love this. Die for oil, sucker!
B000002OG5|2.0|This soundtrack to the awesome film just doesn't feel right.  Watch the movie and enjoy Nino Rota's score in all its glory.
B000001DYY|4.0|Tears for Fears became a favorite of mine right from the start as they were much more than a cut above many of their synthesizer-powered contemporaries during the mid 1980s. Their angst-driven &quot;The Hurting&quot; was a classic and cohesive debut that signaled that these guys had a lot to say. &quot;Songs from the Big Chair&quot; was a more was a hit-filled production that brought soul into the equation and brought them massive commercial success all over the world. The greatest thing about that release is that it succeeded without relying on any particular pop formula. Any release that includes the anthemic &quot;Everybody Wants to Rule the World&quot; and the jazzy &quot;I Believe,&quot; just to name a couple, shows that these guys were going to be much more than a passing trend. Although it took many aborted tries, the duo's third release &quot;The Seeds of Love&quot; was another smash and introduced the world to Oleta Adams and highlighted the duo's softer side. After again struggling to produce their fourth album, Curt Smith wound up leaving the group. Roland Orzabal retained the rights to the duo's name and released &quot;Elemental&quot; as a Tears for Fears product.<br />Many critics and some fans did not  like &quot;Elemental&quot; (although thankfully not most Amazoners), but although it sold well, many found it to be less compelling their any of their first three releases. I only agree to a degree, as &quot;Elemental&quot; may not a 5-star release (the rating that I give to Tear for Fear's first three releases), it easily earns 4 stars on the strength of the first 4 songs (the powerful and addictive &quot;Elemental,&quot; the melodic and catchy &quot;Cold,&quot; &quot;Break It Down Again&quot; which may be THE song that captures the essence of their first three releases, and the jazzy &quot;Mr. Pessimist&quot;). I love &quot;Gas Giants&quot; and all the other songs, with the possible exception of &quot;Power.&quot;<br />In a nutshell, if you are a fan of Tears for Fears, your collection should not overlook this release. If you are not a hardcore fan, you might be better off going for one of their greatest hits compilations as they flow quite well. So 4 starts it is and be on the lookout for &quot;Everybody Loves a Happy Ending,&quot; as it represents Curt's return to the band, but as is always the case with this group something gets in their way of getting their music out there. It appears that the issue is now label-related as Arista (the duo's new US label) changed regimes before the CD was scheduled to come out in mid 2004 and it seems like everything in the pipeline is being questioned by the new regime. Not even the UK version has a release date, but until them enjoy all off Tear for Fears' music, including the underrated &quot;Elemental.&quot;of Tears for Fears, your collection should not overlook this release.

6305949980|5.0|This movie is beyond enchanting, delving into the realms of spellbinding.  I never thought that an animated film could be so stunning with its cinematography mixed with the music.  That's the amazing beauty of Tim Burton's world: it's filled with contrasts.  In particular is Sally (voiced by the Canadian goddess Catherine O'Hara) the ragdoll who externally is not the most beautiful thing with her stitchings and patched clothes, but internally she is pure and filled with love for Jack.  Even her singing (again Catherine) sounds like an innocent child, straight tone (no vibrato) and a flowing, velvet soprano.  <BR>The world of Halloweentown is dark, but filled with beauty and rich melodies straining through (by the genius Danny Elfman).  The construction of the film is so perfect making Halloweentown filled with browns and blacks whereas Christmastown is bright and cheerful, joyful as we expect Christmas to be and the real world is somewhere in between.  All of it pulls together beautifully to create a timeless story and the most magnificently filmed ending with Sally and Jack in the snow.<BR>Just proves the genius of the film makers.
B00005RIKI|5.0|This is, in my humble opinion, the greatest album of all time. As a die-hard classic rock fan, I love bands such as Zep, The Who, JHE, AC/DC, and the Beatles. But Skynyrd tops them all. Why, you ask? Well, for starters, these guys were tough-as-nails blues rockers from Jacksonville, Florida who never got a break unitl they were finally discovered in the early 70s, although they had been playing since the mid-60s. Allen Collins and Gary Rossington were not famous session guitarists like Jimmy Page, and they were all too poor to afford guitar strings, or even shoes. Yet they managed to compose the most emotional, hardest rocking album that has yet to grace any of my CD players. I Ain't the One is a great song with a great drum intro. My drummer friend has declared this some of the most impressive drum work he has ever heard. Tuesday's Gone is a very emotional ballad showcasing some of the only orchestration ever found on a Skynyrd song and some slick slide guitar compliments of Gary Rossington. Gimme Three Steps Shows some of the great lyrical skills of singer Ronnie Van Zant, and is a awesome song that shows Skynyrd having some fun. Simple Man is a hard-rocking song of advice, and is a great song to listen to when your life feels complicated, as my high school career often gets. Things Goin Down shows some great &quot;wild west&quot; piano and delivers a powerful message. Mississippi Kid is different from all the other All-Star Jams on this CD because it is completely unplugged, and yet is a kickass song that gives Van Zant to show off some badass-osity. Poison Whiskey is a good song, but probably the weakest on the album. However, it still far rocks harder that any of the crap kids listen to today and still earns an 8/10 in my book. Freebird, simply put, is the most triumphant song of all time. Anyone who argues this is a fool. If you haven't heard it then your life is incomplete. And all the bonus tracks are a great addition to this already Most Awesomely Triumphant Album of All Eternity.
B0001US8EO|3.0|OVERVIEW: Good story. Outstanding cast. Some good dialogue. A few good gun shooting and fight scenes. But, plain and simple - director Lawrence Kasdan's &quot;Wyatt Earp&quot; is just WAY TOO LONG (3+ hours). You shave 60-70 minutes off this movie to bring it down to the 2 hour mark and perhaps it's a better ride on your sofa.<br />THE CAST: Main stars are Kevin Costner as Wyatt Earp, and Dennis Quaid as Doc Holiday. The rest of the entire cast is secondary. Tho secondary - the rest of the cast is superb - featuring Gene Hackman, Mark Harmon, Isabella Rossellini, Catherine O'Hara, Tom Sizemore, Jobeth Williams, Tea Leoni, Michael Madsen, and James Caviezel. I thought it was an added bonus to see some of these actors trying their hand at a true western picture - like Rossellini (mostly drama or romantic type movies), Sizemore (mostly war pictures), O'Hara (mostly comedies), Williams (&quot;Big Chill&quot; &amp; &quot;Poltergeist&quot; and that's about all I remember for her)... and not even remembering Caviezel in this picture until seeing him in &quot;The Passion Of The Christ&quot; and then having to go back to watch &quot;Wyatt Earp&quot; again.<br />DVD EXTRAS: This is a 2-disc set... where did the bonus features disappear to? I figure with most movies that Kevin Costner has something to do with, they're usually long, somewhat tedious, and lots of attention to detail... despite if the picture might make some critic's worst-ever movie list (i.e. &quot;Waterworld&quot;, &quot;The Postman&quot;, &quot;The Bodyguard&quot;). &quot;Wyatt Earp&quot; has 2 short 15-minute documentaries, some deleted (&quot;lifted&quot;) scenes, and a trailer. No lie, that's it.<br />I wanted to like this movie more... as much say, as I thoroughly enjoyed it's sister flick from the year before, &quot;Tombstone&quot;. Kurt Russell and Val Kilmer (in the role of his life) were awesome together in &quot;Tombstone&quot;; not to mention a nicely cast group of nasty boys featuring Powers Booth and Michael Biehn. &quot;Wyatt Earp&quot; succeeded with Costner and the supporting cast, but Quaid's &quot;Doc&quot; was missing some flare. Not that this was soley Quaid's fault. But, because Kilmer's redention was so good in &quot;Tombstone&quot; that anyone else portraying &quot;Doc&quot; in any movie afterward was destined to be somewhat of a let down. Another bonus in &quot;Wyatt Earp&quot; is the sweeping views of the land - some truly wonderful cinematography. &quot;Wyatt Earp&quot; is much more detailed than any of it's predecessors in following Wyatt's early days... from Wichita, to Dodge City, to the OK Corral in Tombstone, AZ. This was a good movie - just not the best on the subject of the Earps.th and Michael Biehn. &quot;Wyatt Earp&quot; succeeded with Costner and the supporting cast, but Quaid's &quot;Doc&quot; was missing some flare.

The beach full of naked men was hilarious.  (They used a real beach where you can be naked legally)    Thanks to Jeff Schaffer (Director-Writer), David Mandel and Alec Berg for not discriminating uncut men and letting them be up front too.  And I am sure they got a handsome paycheck too.    The scenes of The vatican and Scott Mechlowicz as Pope was comic relief too. Very daring.    Filmed on location in Prague, Czeh. Republic and Warnemunde, Germany.  This is Scott Mechlowicz's first film.
0515127485|4.0|Archangel, by Robert Harris, focuses on a notebook left behind by the evil Joseph Stalin.  Historian Kelso and reporter O'Brien and Stalin-loving Manammatov want this notebook.<br />This novel is better than Fatherland, which asked what would life be like if Germany won WWII.  Kelso is told a story about the night Stalin died by a former guard of Stalins.  This sets Kelso on a quest to find an infamous notebook that Stalin carried with him during all the final days.<br />While set in modern Russia, the novel is filled with segments of history on Stalin which enlighten us about the type of person he was as well as in a way set up the ending.<br />The conclusion of the novel happens a-matter-of-factly, with no great surprise or relevation on the part of the author.<br />This is a good novel with the writing somewhat shifty making me wonder if I missed something.  But there is nothin hidden in this novel of a few characters on the quest for a long-buried secret.  The premise of the secret is somewhat foolish yet still entertaining.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|This movie is so good.  Two Americans &quot;stuck&quot; in Japan. Charlotte (Johansson)is with her photographer-husband (Giovanni Ribisi)who is constantly working and leaving Charlotte in their luxury hotel.

Frustrated with the turn his career has taken, he is suffering from sleepless nights like Charlotte.  Charlotte, while alone in her hotel room, contemplates life and what she is meant to be doing with hers.  One night the Bob and Charlotte meet at the hotel bar where there is an instant chemstry between them.  After a while Bob and Charlotte become friends and have deep conversations about life.  The two have great chemsitry on screen.  Though it may be slow for some people, you can't help but wonder what will happen next.  You cuold not have picked a better pair for this film. Murray is excellent is this, unexpected,dramatic role.  Well written and directed by Sofia Coppla, the first woman to be nominated for an Oscar for directing.  This film proves you don't have to spend millions of millions of dollars on speical effects to be a great film. Well done film by all.  Hopefully Murray will impress us with another dramatic role soon!
B00001QEG5|5.0|Twisted Sister is credited as being one of the original and most influential sleaze rock bands ever. But, not all of their records are remembered. Of course, Stay Hungry will always have a place in the annals of metal history with classic cuts like &quot;I Wanna Rock,&quot; &quot;We're Not Gonna Take It,&quot; and my personal favorite Twisted Sister song ever which is also the title track of that record. But, Love is for Suckers is not quite as remembered. As a matter of fact, I'm a big &quot;SMF&quot; and even I hadn't heard the 1987 release until recently. <BR>I assumed it was some &quot;swing and a miss&quot; record that would just be a dust collecting jewel case in my CD library... Boy, was I off on that one!<br />The album opens up with such a cool track. Arnold Schwarzenegger used &quot;We're Not Gonna Take It&quot; as his campaign theme when he ran (and became) Governor of California. President Bush should use this track, &quot;Wake Up the Sleeping Giant&quot; as his campaign theme. It is about being pushed too far and fighting back. Sounds like it fits, doesn't it? <br />Hot Love is up next. Hot Love is the only track off the record I actually heard on the radio a few times. This song is such a cool hair metal track. I can't help but sing the chorus out loud which is a problem if you are wearing headphones and happen to be in a quiet environment. That's a good way to see the inside of a padded van, actually.<br />The title track &quot;Love is For Suckers&quot; follows next. Another cool song! And, at some point or another, we've all felt the things Dee sings about here. Something about this track reminds me of Alice Cooper's more up beat 80's material.<br />&quot;I'm so Hot for You&quot; and &quot;Tonight&quot; are cool &quot;commercial friendly&quot; songs. <br />&quot;Me and the Boys&quot; reminds me of a 60's girl group song such as &quot;Leader of the Pack&quot; with a lot more guitar influence. For that matter, &quot;One Bad Habit&quot; follows suit with that same style. KISS also did this with &quot;Then She Kissed Me&quot; off the Love Gun album.<br />&quot;I Want This Night To Last Forever&quot; follows with an opening that probably inspired the opening of Warrant's &quot;Cherry Pie.&quot; When you talk about classic hair styled metal, you mean this track!<br />&quot;You Are All I Need&quot; is a beautiful song. It's as far &quot;soft&quot; as Twisted Sister will go which isn't &quot;soft&quot; at all! This is a fantastic song that you can't help but sing along to.<br />&quot;Yeah Right&quot; is a song that probably would fit on any of Twisted Sister's other records. It's a cool song to close out!<br />There is a sad epidemic among metal fans that claims if an album makes you sing along, it's a no good. The are the ones that make fun of the bands I like and like death metal bands from the Netherlands that eat each other. Bottom line, this record does not deserve the insults it gets by the pretentious &quot;journalists.&quot; What it does deserve is air play! Lots and lots of air play! Fantastic record that I recommend to all who love hard rock, hair rock, and all points in between!
B000002J1H|5.0|Going For The One is in my opinion the greatest prog-rock album of all time. I became a Yes fan in the mid 70's and have followed them over the years. This album is the highlight of their collective creativity. The musicianship, the artistry, and the passion in this album have never been equaled by them or any other rock band before or since. From the opening title track to the masterpiece Awaken, this album is sublime.<BR>If you are going to buy one Yes album, make it this one. If you are going to buy 2 yes albums, make it this one and Close to the Edge. The experience of this album can best be summarized by the closing line to Awaken: it's &quot;like the time I ran away, turned around and you were standing close to me&quot;.

When Scooby realizes there is more to Shaggy's new friend than meets the eye, Shaggy refuses to listen and causes Scooby to become a willing, but unknown participant in the evil doer's plan to take over the world.<br />Loaded with great special effects, computer animation and a great cameo starring the puppy everyone loves to hate, Scrappy Doo, this movie is great. The characters all kept the same aspects that made the cartoon great. However, there are some things that kept me from giving this movie 5 stars. In the cartoon, Velma never seemed resentful of Fred always taking the credit, Daphne was more than a spoiled selfish brat, Fred did not act stupid even in the least.<br />If you enjoyed the old cartoon series, you will surly like this live action movie.
0790729628|1.0|The director's cut doesn't even compare to the theatrical version; it lacks everything that made this move great!  Wait for the original version to be released and save your money.  If I could give you my Directors cut, I would.  It's going in the trash when the theatrical version is released.
B000002V1D|5.0|Duran Duran bombed quietly with 1990's \\"Liberty\\" and then disappeared for three years, leading many to think their careers ended with the Eighties.  So everyone was shocked when in 1993 they stormed back to the top of the pop charts.  Their comeback success was deserved: \\"The Wedding Album\\" is Duran Duran's most colourful, dynamic and diverse offering, and ranks with 1982's \\"Rio\\" as one of their best.<br />I can't quite describe my feelings upon hearing the dreamy, soaring ballad \\"Ordinary World\\" for the first time in early 1993.  It was like an old friend had returned after an absence of many years.  Over ten years later, this first single from \\"The Wedding Album\\" retains all its anthemic power.<br />And then a funny thing happened: the second single, \\"Come Undone,\\" was just as good!  For the first time in nearly ten years, Duran Duran had two hit singles from the same album.  The comeback was complete.<br />Fortunately \\"The Wedding Album\\" is more than just a \\"singles\\" album.  As they did with \\"Notorious\\" (1986) and \\"Big Thing\\" (1988), Duran Duran continues to break new musical ground. Standout tracks include the Latin-tinged Milton Nascimento collaboration, \\"Breath After Breath,\\" the Prince-style funk of \\"U.M.F.,\\" and the hip-hop/ambient fusion of \\"Come Undone\\" and \\"Love Voodoo.\\"  More than just experiments, these songs are thoughtful compositions that successfully synthesize diverse genres with Duran's inimitable melodic sensibilities.  <br />A minor complaint about \\"The Wedding Album\\" is that the weakest tracks, \\"Drowning Man\\" and \\"Shotgun,\\" appear early on, disrupting the record's consistency.  But the album quickly recovers with \\"Come Undone\\" and never looks back.  \\"The Wedding Album\\" ends with a bang: the incendiary \\"Sin of the City,\\" an epic tune about the tragic Happyland dance club fire, is an angry and passionate statement about urban exploitation.  It's a scathing social comment that dispels the notion of Duran Duran as self-absorbed pretty boys. <br />More than merely a commercial comeback, \\"The Wedding Album\\" reaffirms Duran Duran's place among the premier pop bands of their generation.  The wait was worth it.
B00000272N|5.0|Facelift by Alice In Chains started it all. Grunge began here. So did one of the greatest bands of all time, Alice In Chains. Jerry Cantrell's guitar playing is amazing and so are his lyrics. Michael Starr and Sean Kinney's rythm is tight as always, and Layne Staleys voice sounds as amzing as ever!<br />The album starts off with one of Alice In Chains best songs, 'We Die Young' is hard, heavy, and scary! 'Man In The Box' is next and it just maybe Alice In Chains best song. It has one of Jerry Cantrells best guitar solos. Next is the classic 'Sea Of Sorrow' which is also one of Alice In Chains best songs. 'Bleed The Freak' is one of my all time favorite Alice In Chains songs, its just a killer song! 'I Cant Remember' is another great song, a little slower but still heavy as hell! 'Love, Hate, Love' is a great hard rocker, its kinda crazy though! 'It Aint Like That' doesnt really stand out but its still a really good song. 'Sunshine' is a killer hard rock song with awesome guitar! 'Put You Down' is a strange but good song. 'Confusion' is a really strange song but I love it. 'I Know Something about you' has Beatles-esq lyrics but metal music, is killer! 'Real Thing' is the perfect song to end the album.<br />Buy this you will love it and I can garanty that!!!
B0000028SR|3.0|It's hard to know what to make of the Boss's twin release of \\"Human Touch,\\" and \\"Lucky Town,\\" in 1992.  He was into striking out on his own and surrounding himself with studio musicians.  I'm not sure if the thinking was that he could free himself up to make some music solely on his own terms or maybe to creatively expand, but for whatever reason it has left these two recordings slightly flat.  Both \\"Human Touch,\\" and \\"Lucky Town,\\" are lumped together in my mind with \\"Lucky Town,\\" being the slightly rawer more rocking of the two.<br />\\"Human Touch,\\" starts out promisingly enough with a classically catchy Springsteen tune.  From there it skips around until it arrives at a less than inspired folky Nebraska-esque \\"Pony Boy.\\"  However, gone is the desperation, the glaring soul cry of poverty and despair, the screaming social need of the working class, the insanity of an insane world, the cold hard light of dawn.  Instead we are left with, \\"Giddy up Giddy up my Pony Boy.\\"<br />Bruce doesn't write to many bad songs and any album he puts out proves very listenable.  The man has a way with music...a gift for the singing troubadour of the common man, a voice for the masses.  Unless you are a diehard fan of the boss, go looking elsewhere for his music.  \\"Human Touch,\\" might leave you slightly untouched.<br />--MMW
B0002D6JX2|5.0|This is probably the best debut album by a female singer I've ever heard. Her vocal range is amazing, with an amazing lower register for her age (17 when recorded, I think) and a higher register not quite up there with Mariah or Celine, but miles better than the vast majority of her peers.<br />Better than her range though is the sheer beauty of her voice, which can send shivers down the spine.<br />This is already double platinum in the UK and 14 x platinum in Australia, where she set a record with 29 weeks at #1, this album is a charming mixture of piano based ballads( she plays four instruments, I believe, although only the piano on this)and more upbeat tunes including one co written with Take That star Gary Barlow.<br />A major talent as a songwriter and musician, but her voice is the most amazing thing. <br />Highly recommended!
B0001AP12G|5.0|This is a most spectacular artist, in his own genre. I love this cd.. my all time fav.. this year. Lyrical, filled with truth, and funny but real.. He shall go far.. you will love it.. Its almost spiritual in nature the one Jesus walks with Pimps etc.. so walk with me. He is not afraid to say it all.. I love him.. Real Truth..
B00007BHOE|5.0|This is an awesome dvd, if you are a Slipknot fan, you MUST have it, and Joey's solo is just amazing.
B0000787FH|3.0|I came upon Elvis Costello's \\"Imperial Bedroom,\\" by way of a Rolling Stone article something along the lines of the best 100 albums of this century and sure enough Costello's \\"Imperial Bedroom,\\" made the cut.  I already was a big fan with a greatest hits tape that introduced me to \\"Allison,\\" and \\"Pump it Up.\\"  \\"Imperial Bedroom,\\" is pretty steeped in the 80's.  Though it contains some memorable songs, the general tenor is symphonic, jazzy, flowing numbers.  For some reason it didn't strike a chord with me like other Costello and the Attractions works I've come to know and love.<br />Granted, \\"Almost Blue,\\" and \\"Beyond Belief,\\" rank right up there with Costello's best, the album stays on the surface slick and sleepy, torchy and touched. Granted it was hard to live up to the expectations set forth by making a Rolling Stones top 100 list, but with the likes of Elvis Costello it was possible.<br />I believe you should give Costello his due...the man is ultra-talented and knows his way around a song.  But unless you are drawn to the more pop-ish polished side of Elvis, go elsewhere.  If you need some \\"Peace, Love, and Understanding,\\" and don't mind some of the sameness give \\"Imperial Bedroom,\\" a whirl.  Just don't get your expectations up too high unless you are a \\"Seal,\\" crossed with Burt Bacharach fan.  If you are...first seek counseling...next get Imperial Bedroom...it's only bound to make the condition exasperated.  Not bad for a sleepy Friday night date under candle-light but other than that the Bed ain't spinning, it's imperial after all.<br />--MMW
B0000931QR|4.0|I love this CD just because the lead singer's voice is amazingly beautiful and unique. =] Aside from that, the CD is unique itself and generally gets everybody in a good mood while listening to it. I recommend this CD to anybody who likes spanish pop rock. It's definitely buyable.
B0002G2B2M|5.0|Eternal Sunshine captivates the meaning of true love in a psychological way, it shows that love with your heart not your head, and how important love memories are and how far you can go to stay with someone just because you love them.
B000268QB2|1.0|Let me preface this review by saying that your musical tastes are you own and this review is really my opinion of this album. That being said, if you like this album you're an idiot. The first song is a really good song that I enjoy listening to. Meanwhile the rest of the album is boring and wimpy. I think a previous reviewer mentioned no emotion and he (or she) is 100% correct.  People mention Coldplay but I just don't see it, I see a Ben Folds Five minus the melodies minus the fun and minus the rock. <br />OK now I'm gonna gripe about the people who arbitrarily label bands with ridiculous genres. Like emo, post-punk, power-pop, indie, renew wave, avant garde etc. Anyway I would label Keane as wimp rock, and wimp is a euphemism for a dirty word that starts with &quot;p&quot; and ends in &quot;y&quot;, figure it out.
0783240287|5.0|My daughters (6&amp;7) love &quot;Joseph&quot; as do I. The music is great and it's a great way to introduce musical theater to the younger audience. One caution though. Joan Collins' outfit is a little suggestive as is the scene where she begins to take off Josephs clothes. But for little ones, I think its totally over their heads and goes by really fast. I wouldn't let that hold you back from letting them experince this dvd. Donny Osmond is a fabulous Joseph. Our family would love to see him do this on broadway again.
B00000JHAU|3.0|Anyone remeber Donovan?  He had a few hits back in the 60's.  Belle and Sebastian sound like today's Donovan. Pretentious! Maybe it is Donovan?  Whatever happened to him?  He could be doing this stuff today?  He was doing this stuff 30 years ago.  <BR>I would pass on this, unless you liked Donovan.  Well then buy some Donovan...<br />Pazz
B00003CXCT|5.0|I wasn't expecting episodes 4-6 to be released on DVD until Episode 3 hit the home video market.  Boy, was I pleasantly surprised when I saw the advertisements for this!  Star Wars Episodes 4-6 were landmark motion pictures.  Sure, the acting is bad and the George Lucas' dialogue is cheesy, but the marvelous feats that were acheived in terms of story and special effects push this trilogy into the stratosphere!  Anyone who's seen these films will never forget the legendary characters, such as Luke Skywalker, Darth Vader or Han Solo.  No one will forget the chilling cliffhanger ending of The Empire Strikes Back, easily the best film of the Star Wars saga.  Even the Ewok-infested Return of the Jedi is classic, especially compared to the mediocre prequels (The Phantom Menace, Attack of the Clones).  And we can't forget the film that started it all, A New Hope, which set the high standard to which all Star Wars films are compared.<br />George Lucas reworked this trilogy in the late 90's, adding a new effect here and there throughout the three films, and this is what's being released on DVD.  Most of these additions are welcome, such as making Mos Eisley look like a busy spaceport instead of a deserted town, or adding windows and color to the Cloud City.  Some are not so welcome, such as the ghastly new musical number in the beginning of Return of the Jedi.  But regardless, these changes are what George Lucas originally intended for these films.  Therefore I welcome them into my DVD collection.  I can't wait to see the comprehensive making-of also.  To any sci-fi fans who haven't seen these films (do they exist?), this is a must!
6305212112|5.0|A story of friendship and love, and how they can both intertwin. Mary Stuart Masterson (Somekind of wonderful) and Mary louise-Parker (Boy's on the side) Displaying fabulous performance's along with Jessica Tandy (Driving miss Daisy) and Cathy Bates   (Misery). The whole story surrounding a relationship that can not be defined. My Favourite film ever!  However i think some people are wrong with one aspect surrounding Ninny and Idgie. That they are one and the same! Best Quote- &quot; Face it girl's.... I'm older and have more insurance&quot; <BR>A film for any Mary Stuart masterson Fan.
037542217X|4.0|In Alexander McCall Smith's latest installment, the reader is once again treated to the unfolding life of Mma Ramotswe and the cast of characters that make up the world of the No. 1 Ladies Dectective Agency.  In this story Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni has recovered from his debiltating depression and lends a wonderful richness to the storyline.  His character as always is understated and charming and we wonder when the the engaged couple will actually get married.  Mma Makutsi figures prominently in the plot and not only does the reader get to know her character more deeply but McCall Smith is able  through her musings make several profound comments on the state of women in society today.  A new dectective who is both arrogant and inept is introduced and it plays nicely in a humorous way  against the womens thoughts about their place in soceity.  Mma Ramotswe's primary case involves a successful man who wishes to atone for his past errors and in doing so is able to move on with his life.  This is easy enjoyable reading, with beautiful prose and descriptions of life in Botswana and thoughts on life that apply to us all. A pleasure!
B00005JMJ4|1.0|There is no plot and there is no acting. Bill Murray didn't even have a script. I watch movies to be entertained, not bored. This is the second movie I could not even finish (the first one was Pi) because it was so boring. I don't know how to explain it any further, there is no plot! It's as simple as that. I would not recommend this to anybody who still enjoys movies with a plot.
B00005JLEU|5.0|I ended up renting the movie from a movie store, don't ask me why... I didn't really expect much... I mean, I was thirteen years old, and I didn't think that anyone could make cartoons with any sort plot or captivating qualities. You watch Disney stuff too much, and it does that to you...<br />But THIS... THIS is NOT a cartoon. It showed more vision than any movie I'd ever seen. The characters had LAYERS, the setting was superb. It seriously made you think you were in a dream... or maybe a nightmare. The PG rating really shouldn't be on this movie, because some of the characters would be terrifying for little kids. <br />It's totally unlike anything you've ever seen... the plot is completely original. I mean, you can't tell me that you'd seen a movie before about a little girl going to work in a bathhouse for spirits.<br />This is on my top five for movies... acutally- scratch that. I think it might be the best movie I've ever seen.

B0000C9JFO|4.0|I remember seeing the poster for this movie at a movie theater<BR>where it was playing last year - movie sounded interesting but<BR>didn't see it at the time.  Forgot about it until a couple of weeks ago, when I saw Around the World in 80 Days - the lead female character was played by Cecile de France.  Intrigued by this actress, I did a database search on her and found out she was in L'Auberge Espagnole, along with Audrey Tautou (who I<BR>remembered from Dirty Pretty Things).  So I ordered this DVD.<br />Enjoyed this movie, especially de France's character (the lesbian<BR>student).  It sort of reminds me of my stays at youth hostels when I travel, where you meet and hang out with others who are  mainly from Europe (and Down Under).  You also run into exchange<BR>students at these places as well (usually taking a break from<BR>their studies and travelling around their host country).<br />However, it was obvious that the scene where the English sister and brother were arguing in her bedroom was severly cut, evident in the sloppy editing (especially right after she kicks him out of her room, you see a cut and then you see them hugging and making up).  The edits were also mentioned by a reviewer from<BR>April 6th - there could be others but I didn't see the movie at a theater, so I'm not sure.
0767903862|5.0|This book is excellent regardless of whether or not you have ever or plan on ever visiting Australia. One thing is for certain, that Bryson's mix of humor and historical facts coupled with this dynamic country prove to be sheer entertainment.
0553573403|5.0|Better then LotR.. Not neccessarily better then Tolkien.. but better nonetheless..<br />Martin uses his characters to deliver the plot, instead of the plot advancing the characters.  This style is a breath of fresh air and really has no boring parts.
B00000J6AG|5.0|When you say the word \\"techno\\", people tend to imagine loud, obnoxious electronic dance songs with loads of annoying sound-effects. Rest assured that if that's your defintion of techno, this ain't techno.<br />Moby takes 18 tracks and tackles multiple genres: rock, hip hop, blues, gospel, accoustic, and many more. Many tracks contain samplings of other songs (ranging from Love Rap by Spoony G and The Trecherous 3 to Run On For A Long Time, a 1937 gospel piece), while others are true original compositions with Moby doing the vocals himself. It creates for a rather confusing effect: you won't know exactly who you're listening to--but believe me, you'll be enjoying yourself too much to care.<br />Moby is a devout Christian, and his spirituality shines in every one of these 18 tracks. It would be wrong, though, to call this  religious music--it's not looking to convert anyone, if that's a worry of yours. I'm an Agnostic myself, and I loved the spiritual, empowering feelings of these songs.<br />I've noticed other reviews say that some songs are great while others fail, but I honestly believe each and every one of these songs has something to offer. Some, like \\"7\\", \\"Down Slow\\", and \\"Inside\\" don't have any lyrics and do resort to a more traditional techno sound, but are enthralling nevertheless.<br />So go on and add it to your shopping cart. If you don't absolutely love it, then--well--feel free to write me an angry e-mail.
B000002J09|5.0|I have a close, intimate bond with Zeppelin IV...  And not just because the old man on the cover carrying sticks is DEAD sexy, but because it is the only vinyl record I have ALL my own, and also because I didn't have to pay money for it.<br />Zeppelin IV starts out with \\"Black Dog.\\" EVERYONE knows \\"Black Dog\\"... Even my MOM knows \\"Black Dog,\\" and she listens to Emmylou Harris and Dolly Parton, of all people.  Anyways, if you DON'T know this song, it's all about splendiferous guitar riffs by Jimmy Page, and Robert Plant does some awesome vocals, even if 50% are just him going \\"OH YEAH, OH YEAH, OH, OH, OH!\\" Apparently, Zeppelin named this song \\"Black Dog\\" because when they were recording Zeppelin IV in the studio, a black dog kept running in and out.  That was your Fun Zeppelin Fact for the day.<br />The next lovely, lovely song is ROOOOOOOCK AND ROOOOOOOLLLLL!  This is one of THE coolest songs in the history of mankind.  Every die-hard Zeppelin fan is aware of the awesome power of this song, and how it makes everyone want to dance around and play humiliating air guitar.  I, however, do not do this... Ask any of my remaining friends.<br />\\"Battle of Evermore\\" is like one of those \\"Dance around the Maypole\\" kind of songs, but it's been grooved-up TO THE MAX.  I personally love it, but some people say they don't get it.  Those people should be lined up and shot.<br />\\"Stairway to Heaven\\" is so awesome is needs to be put on an entirely different paragraph.  The only sad thing about this song is that 70's and 80's radio slaughtered it by playing incessantly 5 times an hour for two decades.  The acoustic guitar intro riff is so famous, and every beginning male guitar student wants to learn it, so they can brag about it to girls who like Led Zeppelin.  However, my favourite part has got to be the solo.  THE SOLO, THE SOLO, THE SOLO... What can I say?  Writing about is not going to illustrate its rock-tasticness.  You have to listen to it for its effect... It'll knock yoursocks off.  OFF!<br />OOH!  The next song is one of my favourites... \\"Misty Mountain Hop\\" is so danceable and trippy and EXCELLENT.  Maybe their Lord of the Rings obsession wasn't so bad after all.  <br />\\"Four Sticks\\" is one of the coolest Zeppelin songs I've ever heard.  It's not their best, but it's just so COOL!  Just listen to that opening riff!   That riff is why no one DARES to cover Led Zeppelin songs.  Not JUST because I would personally hunt them down and hack them into fine cubes with a machete, but because Zeppelin songs are untouchable, you cannot come close to their greatness.  \\"Four Sticks\\" is great because it's trippy and groovy, but the vocals are still amazing, and Page's guitar is unforgettable.<br />The next song I put on CD, because I am a wicked, wicked, \\"Madam Kazaa\\" as my friend says.  Since I have put it on CD, I've been listening to it non-stop full blast in my room with the window open.  The neighbours are starting to give me strange looks... But that's not the point.  The point is, this song is PERFECT.  Robert Plant's vocals are so PRETTY!  I'm quite aware that's not really the correct word, but I don't care.  Also, Page does some of his best guitarmanship on this song.  It's so sweet and lovely, even though when I first heard it I thought \\"Ew, acoustic guitar!\\" and switched to Immigrant Song or something like that.  Then I decided to listen to it again to figure out what to delete from Kazaa because I have approximately 400 Billion songs.  Luckily, I realized how extraordinary this song was.  I CAME TO MY SENSES, MAN.<br />Alright my little ducklings, only one more song to go!  Last, but certainly not least, we have \\"When the Levee Breaks.\\"  When you listen to it, you cannot deny how GREAT the intro is.  It's all jam-packed full harmonica and guitar and percussion and loveliness.   So for a good minute and a half you have that loveliness, and then ROBERT PLANT, OF ALL PEOPLE comes in and starts singing, and you nearly fall off your chair because of the excitement and the musical sensory overload.  Well, I did at least.  This song is so supremely grand.  You've got that driving guitar rhythm, and that wacky harmonica, and Robert Plant, who is one of the greatest vocalists in the Land of Classic Rock.  In fact, in the Land of Classic Rock, Zeppelin IV is one of the greatest albums.
B000063S6Z|5.0|The follow-up CD to the 1999 smash-hit Play well lived up to its expectations. While not quite as good as its predecessor, I don't think anybody will be disappointed.<br />Moby continues to re-define techo in this new album, reminding us all of how far he's come since his raw, electronic beat days. Like Play before it, 18 is full of spiritual, emotional songs--although often he uses this emotional power to create somewhat depressing (but still very beautiful) music, as can be seen is such tracks as \\"Sleep Alone\\", \\"18\\" and \\"At Least We Tried\\".<br />In contrast to Play, there are more slow and melodic songs and less hip-hip and R&B songs. Strangely, although I ordinarily don't care for hip-hop or R&B, I was sad to see both go.<br />Overall, though, this album is a must-buy, and I stand fully behind my 5-star rating. As with Play, all of the songs are unique and special on their own, but come together to create a spiritual journey into a wide spectrum of emotions when the album is played in its entirety.
B000001A9P|5.0|stevie wonder makes up 4 lost time by releasing 2 albums in the same year of 1995.the first release was his long overdue but underrated concept album \\"conversation peace\\"which featured the brilliant but very spiritual sensational 'rain your love down'and the brilliant spiritual song of historical wrongs of atrocities and slavery of heartfelt soul and pain in the album's final title track,'conversation peace'...then the wonderman swiftly releases this live double cd entitled,\\"natural wonder\\"which was recorded at osaka/tel aviv in japan.but before you could enjoy the legend live, there is the attractive packaging of the cd packaging-which is a cardboard foldout with a photo of the genius in the middle which displays the beauty of the earth and it's elements:earth,water,air and fire.<br /><br />the attractive two cd set with each cd matching it's pocket slot:disc number one is the fire cd.disc number two is the cool blue water cd.this double cd package also has an attractive booklet that has nice liner notes and lyrics to three songs:'stay gold'/ms.& mr. little ones/and 'dancing to the rhythm'/ wonder is backed by the tokyo philharmonic orchestra.wonder opens the show by surprise with a new track entitled 'dancing to the rhythm'a song that is mysteriously unique in all it's regal.this song is not available as a studio track on no album,and was recorded live for this live set.it would also be cool if we were to hear this song in studio form.it would also fit nicely on his 'conversation peace'album.'dancing to the rhythm'is a heavenly message song to GOD.once stevie begins the opening chorus from this song,the crowd is in a roar.but they also knew that the song was new and was presented as a musical surprise.the song has incredible crescendos as the violins kick in high gear making the song so dramatically powerful as stevie's voice goes beyond the universe.the song's key verse:'oh,how i longed to be possessed by one somebody-to show me what i should do with my broken life-i'm dancing to the rhythm of your love-singing sweet melodies of your sweet,sweet love'-giving all praises of your sweet,sweet love...this song like all of stevie wonder's other spiritual songs are compelling in their messages when one needs spiritual upliftment.<br /><br />the tokyo philharmonic orchestra gives stevie's classic songs the royal treatment on such songs as 'my cherie amour'/'pastime paradise'/'rocket love'/'ribbon in the sky'/'overjoyed'/'love's in need of love today'/on 'living for the city' the orchestra along with wonder and his backing vocalists really kicks near the end with high caliber speed.the brilliant closers 'for your love'which is given lush treatment, and the latin flavored 'another star'(from \\"songs in the key of life\\")on which stevie shouts at the beginnig of the song to everybody to give a count off, is masterfully captured in all of it's \\"songs in the key of life\\" glory in an explosive jazz dramatic fashion.this live concert is live crystal clear genuis-featuring the brilliant spiritual 'dancing to the rhythm'/'stevie ray blues'a tribute to stevie ray vaughn/'ms.&mr.little ones'a song for the children/and a live rare version of'stay gold'(originally recorded in 1983)from the motion picture,'the outsiders'<br /><br />live classic stevie with exuberance!!!/the only omissions from this live double cd set was any slow track from his classic 1979 double album \\"stevie wonder's journey through the secret life of plants\\" of which some of the songs from that double album are symphony orchestrated.any one of those symphony orchestrated songs from that double album would have fit well inside this live double cd set.the other painful omission from this brilliant live cd is in my opinon one of wonder's greatest jams of all time:'THAT GIRL'.CAN YOU JUST IMAGINE WHAT THIS SONG WOULD'VE SOUNDED LIKE IN THIS SHOW HAD STEVIE DONE THIS ONE LIVE??? this live double cd was released just months after'conversation peace'in the same year(1995).experiencethe crystal clear genuis live!!!!s live!!!!

0743454529|4.0|I am generally not a fast reader, but I zipped through this one in 3 days.  It was an amazingly compelling story, with the characters defined so well that you really understood what motivated all of them and you cared about each and every one.<br />I found a few inconsistencies which were troubling.  For example, talking about the children putting their tow-heads together, and in the next sentence, remarking about how physically opposite they were.  And I don't believe that Campbell would have been allowed to drive or sail with the condition that is ultimately revealed.<br />I also found Picoult to be a little heavy-handed with her descriptions and her metaphors.  Any relatively intelligent person could figure out where the characters are coming from without being hit over the head with some remark or quote that Picoult used to drive a point home.<br />All this aside, I could not put it down and was so sorry to see it end.  It was a real tear-jerker.<br />And this is not related to the book at all, but for those of you who write reviews, please do not give away the ending!  I read some reviews on here before reading this book and I knew how it was going to play out.  That was incredibly disappointing.

B00005YXZH|5.0|Ladies and Gentlemen, we have in our presence an album that breaks ground much the same way Pink Floyd's &quot;Dark Side of The Moon&quot; did. Yankee Hotel Foxtrot is a mind blowing experience that takes Wilco from alt-country to art. Finally burying the legacy of being a piece of the former Uncle Tupelo, this record works on all levels. The songs are well written and meaningful, except perhaps for Heavy Metal Drummer, but even intense drama needs a laugh to lighten the air. This is on my top ten of all time list along with The Beatles &quot;Abbey Road&quot;, Pink Floyd's &quot;Dark Side&quot;, The Replacements &quot;Let It Be&quot; and a few others. Buy this record!
B00008CLOA|5.0|this was the classic album which along with the wall established pink floyd as the greatest rock band on this planet and sold an astonishing 35 million copies worldwide.this should be there in your collection.highly recommended.
B00005LSYZ|2.0|well....the story behind this one is very strange. firstly, you would be insanely lucky to find this album in any music store. in fact, the only way youd be able to get your hands on this album is in a garage sale or here at amazon. you see, this album has 2 stories. first, its rumored that ozzy hated the album and therfore didnt remaster it when we remastered all of his other albums in 1998. strange? another story is that there is some sort of legal dispute about the licensing of this album, and that copies of this album were &quot;disposed&quot; of. the one song that is somewhat considerd an ozzy classic is 'shot in the dark'. once again, you wont find that song on ozzy's excellent greatest hits album 'the essential ozzy osbourne', let alone any song from ultimate sin. i myself, well, havent managed to hear ANY of the songs on this album other than shot in the dark. from what ive heard from others, however, is that it was simply the worst album that ozzy made during his solo career. its up to you to decide. this album is a collectors item!

B000005IS1|4.0|It was only a short 10 days before my first birthday that this event took place. I guess Mom and Dad wouldn't let me trek from Philly to go see this; well the 60's for the most part except for some pop tunes, and country, and stuff like Glenn Yarbourough were part of \\"thier\\" record collection. It took to when I was a teenager to find out about this group. I got the sanitised version of \\"Kick Out The Jams\\" in a local record store. Mind you I drove the owner nuts as he was more into accapella, and doo wop. I got this tape for my 19th birthday, and was a little put off by it at first as the first song \\"Ramblin Rose\\" sounded like a woman singing. It made up for it quickly as the title cut followed, and then there was \\"Come Together\\", and my fave \\"I Want You Right Now\\". This was rock at it's angriest. The snarl that The Standells used in \\"Dirty Water\\" was a pussycat mew compared to this. Not even other local legends like Iggy and The Stooges, or The Sex Pistols were as \\"MANLY\\" sounding as this. It was after this that the MC5 severed ties with thier manager as they felt he was turning them into a hate machine with his lyrics, and his propaganda. I'm glad that the group woke up to that realization, but you can't help, but feel \\"Oh What A Night(Halloween, 1968)\\".
1592400876|5.0|It's not just a great overview of the all-out weirdness of English punctuation -- it's also highly entertaining.  I can't get over the apostrophe on a stick.  :)  It's also gotten me thinking...in the newly announced Harry Potter 6 title \\"Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince,\\" shouldn't \\"half-blood\\" be hyphenated (like that)?  That is going to bug me forever unless someone resolves it.  See, I'm a hopeless stickler.
B0000691TJ|5.0|HOW CAN SOMEONE GIVE THIS 1 STAR AND SAY ITS NO GOOD!!!!!<br />I don't even know what to say,   if you like the Ramones, and I mean like the RAMONES not just &quot;Blitzkrieg Bop&quot; and &quot;Sedated&quot; and all that &quot;First four albums only&quot; crap.   If you are a FAN of the Ramones and like their sound and style, then you will love this album.<br />Honestly I'm not a big fan of &quot;Mamas Boy&quot; and &quot;Too Tough to Die&quot;, so for me the album really gets started with &quot;Durango 95&quot; and doesn't slow down from there.  every song is great.  &quot;Wart hog&quot; has some of the Best lyrics ever (although you cant find them inside the cover, I got them from Dee Dee's book &quot;Lobotomy&quot;)   <BR>&quot;Danger zone&quot; rocks,  &quot;Chasing the Night&quot; is Fantastic, one of the best Ramones songs as well as &quot;Howling at the Moon&quot;<BR>Dee Dee also sings &quot;Endless Vacation&quot; which is another crazy song like wart hog, <BR>Richie wrote &quot;Human kind&quot; which is a great song too.<BR>&quot;Daytime Dilema&quot;, &quot;No Go&quot;!!!!!........This album Rocks,  I don't see how someone can say otherwise.<br />DON'T LISTEN TO THE NAY SAYERS,  THEY ARE WRONG!!!!!<BR>BUY THIS!!!!!!
B0001LJCPC|3.0|Kill Bill Volume one was amazing soundtrack. However volume  two of the movie and the soundtrack is closure to this epic as Godfather three was. I suggest you get volume two for only two good reasons...One, completing the set if you have volume one and two, if you are a fan of tex/mex styled tunes and Morricone music combined with three camp dialog bits from the movie.(what missing is Darryl Hanna's Snake speech) The soundtrack seem thread bare when compared to music of the first Bill Soundtrack.However there is a great piece in Good Night Moon, a waling somber piece which ran over the final credits in the movie.On the whole, if you liked being complete, get the Bill. If not, just leave leave this BILL dead!=Bennet Pomerantz, AUDIOWORLD
B000002L9O|5.0|This is one of the Best Ramones albums,  The Production is not bad,  there is a little too much &quot;synth&quot; of some songs,  like &quot;She Belongs to Me&quot;,  which is not a bad song but it is probably my least favorite slow Ramones song and the production makes it sound pretty weak,  but thats alright. <BR>Other songs like &quot;Somebody put something in my Drink&quot; and &quot;Love kills&quot; (which has the greatest &quot;punk&quot; riff ever), &quot;Mental Hell&quot; and &quot;Animal Boy&quot; totally make up for any weakness.<br />The Synths do sound great on &quot;Something to believe in&quot; and &quot;Bonzo goes to Bitburg&quot;, which is one of the greatest Ramones songs.<br />Dee Dee sings on &quot;Love kills&quot; and &quot;Eat that Rat&quot;,  &quot;Love Kills&quot; is an amazing song and &quot;Eat that Rat&quot; is O.k.,  <br />&quot;Hair of the Dog&quot; is a great song although it doesn't really stand out,   and &quot;Crummy Stuff&quot; is also a great song that doesn't really stand out to me. &quot;Apeman Hop&quot; is another great song which would be greater without the Tarzan Backing vocals,<BR>But I like it anyway.<br />This album has some of my Favorite Ramones songs.  like<BR>&quot;Bonzo Goes to Bitburg&quot;<BR>&quot;Mental Hell&quot;<BR>&quot;Love Kills&quot;<BR>&quot;Somebody put something in my drink&quot;<br />The rest of the album is great,  the only Filler is &quot;Freak of Nature&quot;, which is really cool, but kind of weird.<BR>and &quot;Eat that Rat&quot;, which is also really cool in its own way.<BR>There is no BAD song on the album, and I listen to it all the time. <BR>If you're looking to buy a Ramones album from the Late 80's era, than I suggest this one first.
B00005YUPO|2.0|Having bought so many of the other Baby Einstein DVDs, I couldn't wait to watch this one with my 18 month old son.  We were both very disappointed.   My son could not \\"get into\\" this one.  It is the only one in the series that he hasn't liked so far.  I believe it may be that the visuals just don't match well with the music, and the whole dvd is quite dull.
B0000AXE8I|3.0|I absolutely loved the original Matrix. I still do. It got me thinking about things I'd never considered all that seriously, such as the potential negative implications of artificial intelligence and ultra-sophisticated technology. I was also drawn to the philosophical issues it raised, and I was motivated to learn more about the ideas presented in the story. For me, no other film has held such strong intellectual appeal. I've watched the DVD an embarrassing number of times. I've never grown tired of it.<br />When I learned that two more Matrix films were in the works, I was overjoyed. Unfortunately, my joy came to an abrupt halt when I saw Reloaded. I fully admit that my high expectations contributed to my disappointment, but that certainly doesn't account for all of it. Among other things, Reloaded is so top-heavy with bombast and claptrap that I actually stopped caring about the characters and had no further interest in what might happen. I definitely don't enjoy these kinds of feelings. <br />I wanted so much to like Reloaded that I actually saw it several times hoping I'd missed a crucial element, or that it would grow on me, or *something*. But it continued to leave such a bad taste in my mouth that I had no desire to see Revolutions.<br />As luck would have it, however, I recently had an opportunity to rent Revolutions for practically nothing -- so out of curiosity, I went for it. I'm glad I did, because it helped redeem the overall trilogy for me, although not as much as I would have liked. The only expectation I brought to Revolutions was that it couldn't possibly be worse than Reloaded. Luckily it isn't, but it still can't touch the original. <br />One of the other reviewers has mentioned that an indefinable &quot;something&quot; is missing from Revolutions. Well, I can identify at least three things that are absent from this film: a plot, convincing dialog, and decent acting (with one exception, which I'll get to momentarily). I also discovered that Revolutions essentially has no human stars, despite the presence of Reeves, Fishburne, Moss, et al. The only true stars of this film are its special effects.<BR>    <BR>Granted, the effects are spectacular. The battle for Zion is a feat of CGI splendor -- although I would have appreciated it more had it been shorter. It's almost like the Wachowskis are trying to compensate for the film's shortcomings by clobbering the audience with protracted high-tech eye candy. <br />I was relieved that there aren't many hand-to-hand (or should I say foot-to-head?) combat scenes in Revolutions. There are only so many ways to kick a bad guy in the face, and I got more than my fill of such things in Reloaded. <br />Of the fight sequences that *are* in Revolutions, I found the super-duper burly brawl between Smith and Neo -- in the rain, no less -- to be cartoonish and silly. It was almost as bad as the &quot;Trinity crashes through a window and repeatedly shoots at an agent while falling about a million stories toward the pavement&quot; sequence in Reloaded.<br />Revolutions also continued the nonsensical double-talk so prevalent in Reloaded. I'm sure it's meant to sound profound, but to me, it only sounds foolish. &quot;Why are you here?&quot; &quot;Because I choose to be.&quot; &quot;What are you going to do?&quot; &quot;What I need to do.&quot; &quot;What's going to happen?&quot; &quot;What's meant to happen.&quot; (Where's a wall that I can smash my head into?) Both Reloaded and Revolutions perfected the art of answering questions without answering them.<br />And what's with all of the endless squabbling in Zion, which started in Reloaded and continues in Revolutions? You'd think that people who have so much at stake would learn to work together more harmoniously and effectively. Instead, they engage sniping, whining, cursing, yelling, tantrums, petty jealousies, and head-butting. This became so tedious that I stopped caring whether or not Zion and its residents would survive.   <br/>Be that as it may, I consider Revolutions to be a worthy diversion if taken at face value. Any meaningful philosophical underpinnings vanished for me after the original Matrix. I approached Revolutions with the intent of trying not to think too much and just going wherever it wanted to take me. On that level, I feel it succeeds.        <BR>       <BR>The one character I thoroughly enjoyed throughout all three films is Agent Smith. In Revolutions, I love the way Hugo Weaving pulls out all the stops and chews the scenery with such diabolical glee. In contrast, the other characters are merely boring. In some places, they're boring and irritating.<br />As other reviewers have noted, Revolutions ends in a way that leaves a back door open for a fourth Matrix film. Well, I have something to say to the Brothers Wachowski about that, starting with some hokey dialog that they, themselves wrote: &quot;Everything that has a beginning has an end.&quot; (Naaah...really?) For me, the Matrix ended after the first film. That's where it should have stopped. Please don't make it worse by grinding out a fourth installment. Let it end now.<br />Meanwhile, since &quot;cookies need love like everything else does,&quot; I'll be doing my part. I love cookies.
0446677450|5.0|That is why people never succeed! Most of us surrender to the rat pack 'mentality of life.'<br /><br />Developing our own talents and cultivating a wonderful life is work of art. These magic moments are 'portraits of life.'  We can only paint the picture once. (Country Group: Alabama)<br />Creating a life is the art of human skill.  Art transforms what is. It is the creative impulse in every human heart.  The nature of our success will depend on the artistry of our actions from day to day, from sunrise to sunset.  Studying and mastering the art of achievement is the most significant element of success. (Aristotle)<br /><br />In our personal and vocational lives, there are an abundance of activities that we as Americans, can accomplish that go far beyond settling for just a good life.  Preferably, a meaningful life can be spectacular, even under the worse of conditions as long as one has a hand in creating something of extrinsic excellence that makes a contribution to life.<br />Robert T. Kiyosaki has written a brilliant book that challenges every free thinker about embracing life to the fullest.  He challenges us, as free spirits, to exercise our minds and body. Those who us who take responsibility for our own lives will do better than those who expect others to care for them.  Let's make our own decisions and never blame anyone else.<br />Take a quick reality check! Look at the different types of people driving on their way to work. \\"All the lonely people, where do they all come from? Where do they all belong? (Beatles) They know a lot and they act important, but off to work they go because they owe! Why do the smart lawyer, the informative accountant, the hard-working union employee, and our knowledgeable bosses get stuck in the same traffic jam?  Wisdom is greater than knowledge. Clear and independent thinking is how some people without a high school education become wealthy and fly over the traffic jams. Think about it!<br />As Sharon Lechter brilliantly states, &quot;Today we are facing global and technological changes as great or greater than those ever faced before. No one has a crystal ball, but one thing is certain...play it safe or play it brilliantly by preparing, getting [properly] educated and awakening your own financial genius.&quot;<br />America is the land of the free always fresh with many opportunities for creating ideas. With great effort, anyone can achieve prosperity.  &quot;If today you are a gardener, or unemployed, you have the ability to educate yourself and teach those who you love, such as your children, to take care of themselves financially.\\"<br /><br />I am startled by the negativity surrounding this book. Obviously, Richard T. Kiyosaki is no fake because he provides documented proof about how he became a millionaire. He promotes his valuable ideas to us.  Only those types with abnormal thought processes would nit-pick this great masterpiece. I am committed to reviewing all his books and participating at his seminars. Live long and prosper!

B00005JN0A|4.0|This movie is better then I thought it would be. Why? Because it's so damn funny! I literally was rolling on the floor, laughing at some parts (especially \\"scotty doesnt know\\", and \\"escuse\\"). But I'm getting ahead of myself. the movie is about a guy named Scotty who has this German friend on the internet named Mikea. Mikea helps Scotty with his German homework by translating things for him in German. He thinks this person is a male and wants to have \\"sexual relations\\" with him when Mikea is actually a she. When Scotty finds this out him and his friend Cooper decide to go to Europe and make sure that Scotty can make up with his German friend and possibly make a relationship (a la boyfriend/girlfriend). Scotty and Cooper then meet up with these twins who are also in vacation in Europe, and together the four head to Berlin, Germany.<br />The movie isn't very believeable at some points. For example - every single person that they meet somehow comes back and helps Scotty and CO. However in my oppinion this is the only thing that holds the movie back. The movie has alot of great things in it, although I'd hate to give them away. <br />This movie may not be believeable but it's a hella fun ride while it last and you will laugh your pants off til your in tears - Fact. If your into crazy comedys like Old School and Road Trip this is definitly the movie for you (and any male - SHOULD see this movie). However if you find those movies to be too gross for your tastes then Eurotrip isn't the movie for you.
B0000TB03W|5.0|Shania Twain is a hit machine and all of her best showed up in Chicago. I really enjoy this DVD when I get home from work. Shania has a very high energy show, a rockin' band and great chemistry with her fans. I love her new songs like &quot;She's Not Just a Pretty Face&quot; and &quot;I'm Gonna Getcha Good&quot;, but her old songs are performed with equal zest! Definitely a must have for the fan!
B0000D96NW|5.0|I've known who Machine Head was since 2001. I've heard that they have not released a good album in years. I heard some of their stuff off of The Burning Red, and Supercharger, and I wasn't very impressed. But when I saw the video for their first single &quot;Imperium&quot; off of Throught The Ashes Of Empires, I was blown away. I was hearing great reviews for this record and people were saying that Machine Head is back to doing what they do best, and that is making great records that are heavy, fast, and downright brutal. Songs like &quot;Imperium&quot;, &quot;Bite The Bullet&quot;, &quot;Left Unfinished&quot;, and &quot;Elegy&quot; are great songs. Through The Ashes Of Empires has made me into a Machine Head fan. If you have heard any of the new songs off of Throught The Ashes Of Empires, go to your local record store or electronic store and buy Machine Head's new album Through The Ashes Of Empires. You will not be disappointed with this record. This record truely is inspirational metal.

B00011RPB0|5.0|Lost In Translation is one of those movies that you're either going to love unconditionally, or absolutely hate; there is little in-between ground to be had, as you can probably tell from the sheer diversity of reviews on this site alone. Personally, I loved this film, it's the first film I've seen in a long time that has left me feeling so affirmed: everything about this movie is beautiful, from the story it tells, to the camera work and cinematography and the performances given by its two leads. Bill Murray, in particular, is excellent (that goes without saying) in his melancholoy, often deadpan performance as Bob, and it is from him that the films funniest moments stem, which, although they are rarely laugh out loud funny, are numerous and will keep you smiling throughout.<BR> The humour, although good, is not really the main pull of this movie, for me at least. What really makes this movie work is the beauty of the relationship Bob and Charlotte manage to find with each other, without degrading it to Hollywood cliches or a contrived romantic drama. Throughout, the movie remains true to life, yet in such a way that it touched me deeply, something no film has done in a long time, and with my first viewing, i fell hopelessly in love with it. Obviously this is not for everyone, but it would be almost criminal not to try this film at least once, even if you're not expecting to like it. Personally, i'm not the sort of person you'd generally expect to enjoy a movie like this, but it has, in a short while, become one of my all time top 5 movies (and, from someone who watches a LOT of movies, that is a big endorsement). The atmosphere is intoxicating (helped by the magnificent soundtrack and locations) and everything about this movie, ending included, really spoke to me in such a way that it left me feeling almost life affirmed again. Undoubtedly, this is one of the finest movies ever produced and it deserves the recognition it is getting, a charming look at plutonic love that does not resort to standard Hollywood cheese. No matter what else has been said, this film will always be one of my absolute favourites.
B00005NTJM|4.0|\\"This Was\\" is Jethro Tull's debut album from 1968. Led by the charismatic singer/flautist Ian Anderson, this first incarnation of the group, rounded out by guitarist Mick Abrahams, bassist Glenn Cornick and drummer Clive Bunker, deliver an exceptional platter of blues-flavored rock. Though the album has a sort of low-fi feel to it (Anderson says in the new liner notes that the album only costed $1200 to make, and the recording of it was simple), \\"This Was\\" is still an excellent beginning for this most-excellent band. The band's playing is amazing, and many Tull classics are found here, such as the dirty blues-rock of \\"My Sunday Feeling,\\" the groovy \\"Beggar's Farm,\\" the light-hearted instrumental \\"Serenade To A Cuckoo,\\" the rockin' \\"Dharma For One\\" (featuring a great drum solo by Bunker), and the jaunty \\"A Song For Jeffrey.\\" This remastered edition of \\"This Was\\" also comes with three bonus tracks: the bluesy \\"One For John Gee\\" (the band's tribute to the manager of the Marquee Club where they used to play in the early days), the classic Tull rocker \\"Love Story,\\" and the beautiful yuletide number, \\"Christmas Song.\\" Shortly after the album's release, Mick Abrahams left Jethro Tull and was replaced by guitarist Martin Barre, who has remained with the band ever since. But this is where it all started for Tull. Although they would totally top themselves with their outstanding 2nd album, \\"Stand Up,\\" \\"This Was\\" remains a first-rate debut album for one of rock's all-time greatest groups.
0393964582|5.0|Mary Shelley, her husband the poet Percy Shelley, Lord Byron, and his physician Doctor Polidori were staying at Byron's country villa. It was a stormy night of orgies, opium, and ghost stories. The men also liked to discuss the theory of galvanism--scientifically bringing a dead body back to life. It was this that gave Mary Shelley the central idea for her main character, a creature created and brought to life by a mad science. And it was out of these nightmare-inducing, drug-induced, spine-chilling elements that Mary Shelley was struck with the idea to write her masterpiece about Frankenstein, a misunderstood and persecuted but otherwise good and gentle \\"noble savage\\" and freak creation of science. This book will teach you a thing or two about how people treat the outsider, and about how it's important to judge people from the inside, not the outside.<br />David Rehak<br />author of \\"A Young Girl's Crimes\\"
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is the only TV show I would ever own on DVD. Smart, funny, consistent, involving, well, what can I say that hasn't already been writen in the over 1000 other posts praising this set. See you at the movies when 'Serenity' hits the big screen.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I bought this a couple of months ago having seen only a couple of the shows when it was on FOX. Like many of the other reviewers, I was blown away by the series. I have watched it several times and look forward to seeing it again. I too am frustrated that the series was prematurely cancelled. Hopefully it will be picked up by one of the networks for additional seasons after the movie comes out. If you don't have this yet,order it now.
B00007AJF9|1.0|Lovely, beautifully acted, blah blah...<br />But why would the producers/writers take such an EXCITING true story, and change all the facts, and make is so much boring than it actually was?  The real story has everything: romance, murder, betrayal, a wife pushed down the stairs, politics... so why turn it into such a dull, ordinary, mushy romance?<br />If you want to watch a strong woman influencing world events, watch &quot;The Lion in Winter.&quot;  If you want to read about the TRUE story of Elizabeth's ascent to the throne, read Alison Weir's books.  If you want to watch a goopy romance movie, there are plenty of much better ones to choose from.  But don't waste your time with this movie.
B00008PX8P|5.0|This world has not ever seen, nor probably ever will see, a band more talented than Led Zeppelin.  Each individual is probably at least one of the three or four best at what they do of all time, and as a cohesive unit the ESP and chemistry is often unbelievable (e.g. the spontaneous 'funky' middle section of &quot;Whole Lotta Love&quot; from Knebworth).<br />The package here is unbelievable -- so it seems, and then you listen and watch and you are captivated.  First off, disc one presents an entire early show of Zeppelin performing in classic 'tight, but loose' style.  These guys knew they were amazing, and you can tell they just want to go nuts on stage, but instead come off as reserved... the band was new and didn't have the 'creative license' that they had once four or five albums had come out and the whole experience was more welcomed.  If you want to see a good hard rock concert, then the Royal Albert Hall disc is your best bet.<br />However, if you want a live experience, just go on to disc two.  The Sydney performance of 'Immigrant Song' is much more animated than the surprisingly dated-looking 1970 show.  Once Madison Square Garden arrives, the band has full command on stage and really knows how to work the crowd.  Just one of the bonuses is getting to hear a new 'Since I've Been Loving You,' with Page's ever-evolving solo work.  'The Ocean' is a tremendous piece of business that goes back to more of a traditional rock show feel and sets the juxtaposed stage of Earl's Court perfectly.  The acoustic set shown there might highlight the entire DVD set, as a side of Zeppelin generally ignored by their critics makes itself manifest.  Again we learn the prowess of John Paul Jones as he seemingly plays at least 18 instruments at once, and in perfect harmony with the duet of Page's acoustic guitar and Plant's vocals.  And, as always, it's always a treat to get to hear yet another rendition of 'Stairway to Heaven' and its earth-shattering solo.<br />However, as a whole, the Knebworth footage may be the finest show on the set.  Finally... authorized live versions of songs past the album Houses of the Holy.  In all their glory, 'Achilles' Last Stand,' 'In the Evening,' 'Sick Again' (which is a fine surprise), and mostly, 'Kashmir' truly rock you more than all the rest, especially if you own &quot;The Song Remains the Same&quot; and &quot;How the West Was Won.&quot;  A completely new and inspired performance of 'Whole Lotta Love' completes the unmatched trek that is Led Zeppelin live.<br />The extras are great too... but I won't go into depth with them.  The only main qualm I have is the lack of a performance of 'Thank You,' as there's an audio &quot;tease&quot; of it on one menu screen but that's it.  All in all, this is the finest collection of live material I have ever seen in one package.  If you're a Zeppelin fan, then you should own this definitely.  If you enjoy rock and roll in general, then maybe you should take this opportunity to witness the pinnacle of your preferred genre at their best -- on stage.
B00005JMJ4|2.0|It was okay, but there were so many glaring inconsistencies that it made no sense.  We are supposed to believe that Charlotte graduated from Yale 2 years ago and was married 3 years ago... when is the last time that a Junior at Yale got married?  And while she was at Yale, how was her boyfriend/fiance/husband being a hotshot LA photographer?  Why wouldn't they have waited until she was graduated, if they couldn't even live together until then?<br />This might seem really minor, but it bothered me for the whole movie.  How could I believe in the actions and motivations (and it is very much a movie about actions, or lack thereof, and motivations) when there was such a tremendous aspect of the character's life that made no sense whatsoever?<br />The movie was beautifully shot, and you definately get a sense of the isolation.  There are a few very good lines.  The actors are all great.  It is worth seeing, if only to decide for yourself if the hye is worth it.  I didn't think that it was, but I'm aware that's not a popular opinion.
B00005JNA2|5.0|Honestly, perfect is the only word that i can use to describe this movie...i mean, wow, people could say that it has it's flaws or awkward moments, but doesn't every conversation, because that's what this movie is, a conversation between two lovers who planned to meet again, but never did.(find out who's fault it is)Now, after planning to never see each other, and be left for the rest of their lives to wonder what could have happened, they do meet...and the chemistry is still there. Ethan hawke is my favorite actor, the two share an undeniable chemistry. now let me touch on the ending...as i felt myself coming towards the end of this movie, i felt a sense of dread, not only because this amazing ride was ending, but because i thought that no ending could be suitable to such a story...i was wrong. Richard Linklater never ceases to amaze me, he did an incredible job of combining the two obvious endings (Them falling hopelessly in love, dropping their lives so they could live happily ever after, or him just leaving, and them never seeing each other again.)he manages to find a median the leaves the viewer smiling as they leave the theatre, as well as the hours following. In the end, watch this movie, you wont regret it, i promise.
B00005JM02|4.0|Okay, don't laugh, but I thought this was one of the scariest movies that I've ever seen.  I spent the whole time clutching my boyfriend's arm.  Meanwhile, the 7 year old on the other side of me was laughing his head off and having a great time.  So maybe it is just me.<br />The movie is a Pixar film, so obviously it's brilliant.  Great animation (the reef at the begining), great writing, great story, great characters.  The beauty of the animation must be seen to be believed.  Hopefully it will also teach kids a lesson about taking care of their pets.<br />If your child (or you) does get scared easily, you might want to procede with caution.  It's obvious that it's going to have a happy ending... but it's a bumpy ride getting there!
B00005JMUA|5.0|Everyone keeps talking about how Vol. 1 is better than Vol. 2...IT'S ONE MOVIE!!!! QUENTIN TARANTINO HAD TO SPLIT IT BECAUSE OF IT'S LENGTH!!! PAY ATTENTION!

B00005MP58|5.0|Colin Firth in a wet white shirt?  Need I say more?<br />Okay, I will.  This is a snappy updating of one of Austen's best loved books.  Some of the attitudes of the characters are rather modern, but the tremendous spirit of the books is retained.  It is wonderfully cast: Jane has that &quot;on another planet&quot; manner that she has in the book, and who would have thought that frumpy little Saffron from AbFab makes such a wonderfully flaky Lydia?<br />And did I mention that Colin Firth wears a wet, white shirt?
B000069HK2|1.0|The Used is a horrible band. I saw them live when they were on tour with Taking Back Sunday and blink-182. All they did was tell everyone to stick their middle fingers in the air and say &quot;f***you&quot; to the people on stage that they got to come up. The lead singer looks like someone out of a heavy metal band. He has a high pitch whiny voice that gets old and annoying quickly. The only thing that makes me puke more than this album is when the lead singer makes himself puke when he screams. Don't buy this CD. Buy Brand New, From First to Last, Matchbook Romance, etc. But don't waste your money on this lame excuse for a CD.
0452282152|1.0|When we meet the protagonist, her family has lost its livlihood because her father was disfigured in a horrible accident.  With an opening like that, you'd think you'd feel some sort of emotion about the family: it would be hard for an author to make it so that you DON'T care.  Well, Chevalier manages.<br />There was no character that was multi-dimensional.  No one grew or learned anything.  The ending was a cop-out and random.  I had no sympathy for anyone, except perhaps Vermeer's shrew of a wife: I'd be pretty sick of looking after all those kids with such a pathetic husband too.  Somehow, I don't think that's what Chevalier intended.<br />The Dorothy Dunnett books provide a MUCH better insight into merchant life in the early Rennaissance.  Skip this simplistic, poorly written book and check them out instead.
B000268QB2|4.0|If you like melody and pounding piano-based pop, this should be right up your alley.  Somewhere Only We Know is getting all the attention, and rightly so, but there are a lot of other solid tracks here.  Bend and Break is a fantasic song that gets better with repeated listens.  Just a notch below those two are This Is The Last Time and Everybody's Changing.  Keane loses steam during the second half, but the standout tracks are so good that it's still one of the most listenable new CDs to come out the past couple of years.  <br />As for the Coldplay comparisons, except for the piano, I don't think they sound all that alike.  Clocks is destined to be on the radio for a long time, but this CD is better front to back.
B000002WU9|5.0|The beginning of this classic album sets you up with Ghostface and Raekwon talking about how they have to make it big, and how they're putting this classic out. And on the first song they completely blow you away. The two have been bruthas since they were kids, and as Method man once said \\"they hate the rest of the world.\\"  So Cuban Linx (which is as much Ghostface's as it is Raekwon's) is founded on the friendship of two bruthas from the streets who love the mafiaoso stye, and with an eerie (yet genius) mix of shaolin. The result is a dark , powerful force which cant be ignored.<br />Rakewon displays his abilities as a soloist in knowledge god, which he deserves great praise for:<br />\\"Mafia flicks, tyin up tricks was his main hobby<BR>Teachin his seed, Wu-Tang karate.\\"<br />Incarcerated scarfaces is another all time rap classic which in my opinion is not only the best track on this excellent album but one of the top five tracks in hip hop history. It opens up with  a great scence from a kung fu movie of a shaolin hero. It is a Raekwon soloist track as well. Great beat and incredible lyrics: Can't stand unofficial, wet tissue, blank bustin Scud missles<BR>\\"You rollin like Trump, you get your meat lumped<BR>For real, it's just slang rap democracy\\"<BR>Incarcerated Scarfaces like so many other songs on this album has ghostface and Raekwon coming up with hilarious, witty phrases with street grime to them. <br />Even the song ice Water which has a pretty weak beat is totally redeemed by lyrics like : \\"I know a few niggaz sniff coke, it cause seizures<BR>Peace to half-moon Caesars<BR>and all the bitches in the bleachers\\"<br />Then you have the Nas collaboration with Ghostface as well in \\"Verbal Intercourse\\" which is anther indubitable classic. Which is shortly followed by Ice Cream. Ice Cream is another hilarious take on women. It is not terribly misogynistic, it is just funny as anything.  <br />This album is a trip into the perfecct collaboration team of Ghostface andRaekwon and shows how the friendship between these two leads to a shocking display of rap music. When listening to some of these songs you will be captivated by the beats (produced by the RZA btw), and ofter you will hear a few lyrics and drop your jaw in disbelief.<br />This is the real stuff.
B000001EL3|5.0|This is considered by Kiss to be their best release ever.It is great.Is it their best?In my opinion no.Having said that.I am a huge Paul Stanley fan .He could record himself singing the alphabet &amp; I would buy it.
B00006RINF|3.0|I've heard a lot of great things about this band - I was sad to find out that not much of it was based in fact. Musically, they're pretty good, but they're extremely weak lyrically. It's like listening to a high school girl's diary. &quot;Your lies&quot; this and &quot;destiny&quot; that. The theme doesn't work, try something else.
B00002E224|5.0|If you want action and don't care for talking films, this isn't for you. If on the other hand you are the type of person who enjoys conversation and getting together with others to talk a  sort of stream of conscious about things that are important to you, then this is a terrific and sweet film. I saw it at the movie theater when it was released. I went alone and saw it alone, I was the only person in the theater. When it was finished I could say nothing but wished I had someone to share that feeling with. The guy waiting to 'clean' the theater (I didn't even have popcorn or anything to drink) remarked, \\"It's a pretty bad movie isn't it?\\" figuring I'd agree with him. It felt like he punched me or something, his remark almost physically hurt and I found I couldn't respond to him. I think it's a great movie and should be seen by many. My sister on the other hand refers to it as every straight man's wet dream. Different strokes for different folks.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|It's inevitable that not everyone is going to love LIT; It's a quiet film, short on thrills and plot, and there's not a whole lot going on on the surface-In other words it's a movie you gotta think about.So don't go in with high expectations.You might hate it, or you might just love it, like I did!It captures that feeling of drifting apart, feeling out of sync with the rest of the world so perfectly, you'll get chills, I swear.Bill Murray envelops his usual slapstick sarcasm with a warmth and wisdom-his performance is absolutely superb.Scarlett Johansson is a beautiful young woman, and her acting is lovely.The on screen relationship between the two actors is the centerpiece of the movie-and a touching and beautiful thing to behold.All in all, this is a cinematic marvel I won't soon forget.And why should I forget a  film this poignant,subtle,wistful, funny, and romantic?LOVE IT

B00005QDW1|3.0|I only liked a couple songs like: Running, Makeout, In My head and one or two others. I cannot stand to listen to Hey BABY.  I liked the Tragic Kingdom, Beacon Street and Return of Saturn cd's better.  I thinked they rushed too fast to do this cd.  They had just released Return of Saturn and a little over a year later, this cd came out.  Hopefully, this was just one cd they just didn't care to take seriously and just wanted to have fun.  Let's hope for the next cd's, that they'll get back to the real No Doubt ways.<br />P.S- This might sound mean, but maybe Gwen needs to have some relationship problems in order to release another cd that would sound as good as their previous ones.

0385335482|1.0|I really hate slamming books, really I do.  This book is the typical chick-lit that I've grown to love, and to be fair, it's a quick read.<br />But, my praise stops there.<br />The main character of this book, Rebecca Bloomwood, is the most annoying, daft, and ridiculous character I have ever had the misfortune to read about.  I understand that she's a &quot;shopaholic&quot;, but I've had quite a few friends who fell into that catagory that were never in danger of being as simple-minded and arrogant as Rebecca.<br />Every time I put this book down, I find myself angry.  My forehead is wrinkled, and I'm snapping at my innocent boyfriend.<br />Why?<br />I'll give you a hint:  It isn't because I'm upset at having to put the book down!<br />All I can tell you is that unless you, yourself, are ignorant, incredibly stupid, deceitful, materialistic, dishonest, and rude...you will find nothing to associate with in Becky Bloomwood.
B00003CXI0|5.0|Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone one of the best fantasy films i've seen, but one of the best films of 2001. when it premiered, the film broke box office records grossing over $100 million in it's opening weekend. the movie itself lived up to the hype and anticipation. <br />Believe or not, some ridiculous morality groups including agassiz middle school in fargo nd actually voiced concern over the film because of the witchcraft element. <BR>from my experience with working kids (i mentor and tutor kids in my spare time ) i can tell you that kids can tell fiction from reality and right from wrong. ''harry potter and the philosopher's stone'' is based on the successful children's book by j.k. rowling who many didn't know is a woman, until she was interviewed on 60 minutes <br />Also what other people may not know is the children's books weren't successful at first. j.k. rowling came up with the idea for the books while working as a teacher. when rowling first displayed her early harry potter stories to publishers, all of them turned her down!!! Apparently these book publishers (like many in general) didn't know a good thing even if it bit them on the leg. eventually about 4 and 1/2 yrs after rowling's finished her final harry potter, warner bros. and chris columbus amazed by the popularity of the books, and seeing the opportunity to profit from it, convinced her to do a film from her books. this film ''harry potter and the sorcerer's stone'' is the result. <br />The film starts of by a mysterious sequence in which a young boy is dropped of the doorstep of a neighborhood. a big giant, named hagrid (robbie  coltrane(, looks at the boy and eventually promises that he eventually come back for this special boy, who has an unusual birthmark on his head. <br />The boy we learn is Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) and he been brought here to be brought by one of the worst excuses of a mom and dad: His nasty aunt and uncle Mr and Mrs. Dursely (Richard Griffiths and Fiona Shaw) and their big fat son named Dudly. They abuse Harry literally using him as a slave around the house, and offering little luxury and love. We fast about 11 yrs, and suddenly we see that Harry is going hundreds of letters inviting him to come to the school of Hogwarts. Harry doesn't know what ''Hogwarts'' is, but his aunt and uncle, and like evil people do and keep that info away from hm, literally ripping  up every letter addressed to Harry from Hogwarts. <br />As Harry and his ''family'' are visiting the zoo , Harry notices he has special odd powers: He can talk to a snake and and literally makes the snake comes alive!!! Dudley, the big fat kid, tries to pet the snake, but ends going through the windows and poops his pants, lol, as he sees the snake escaping. 0 Harry is shocked, but happy he has this special powers. Eventually that day, Hagrid, comes to Harry's house, and tells him all about ''Hogwarts'' which is a special Wizards and Witches school for kids. He also tells Harry that he is a great wizard!!!!!!!! Harry and Hagrid, then leave the Dursely's and Harry begins his first step into the adventure at Hogwarts. <br />At Hogwarts, Harry meets other potentials wizards and witches like Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) who become Harry's roomates at Griffindoor. <BR>The headmaster, Albus Dumbledore (Richard Harris), and a magical hat sort every Wizard and Witch candidate into their appropriate dorm, and so Harry Potters new classmates Ron Weasley and Hermione are sorted into Griffindoor. <BR>Here Harry and others meet their teachers such as Professor Snake (Alan Rickman from Die Hard fame) who specializes in potions. They also learn a  bout special sports at Hogwarts like quidditch a special wizard sport. However, the trio also uncover mystery , danger, and adventure as they uncover, trolls, three headed dogs, and a special mystery known as ''The Philosopher's Stone''. Harry above all will discover a mysterious secret about his parents, and their encounter against, an evil Wizard named Voldemort. <br />''Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone'' is loaded with <BR>special effects: The school of Hogwarts is loaded with special spirits and dangers. There is a great effect in the film where a couple of painting come alive in the movie!!! It looks cool. More special effects such as the walking stairways at Hogwarts. Of course the biggest effects come with showing the Wizard powers of Harry, and the amazing enemies he encounters. <br />''Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone'' also has great makeup effects as well:  For example , Harry in the beginning meets a couple of Goblins who work at the  Gringotts bank where Harry has an account. The makeup is fantastic, the people playing the Goblins look amazingly real in their makeup. <br />''Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone'' was a big hit for it's great story about a special boy, the amazing adventures he has as he Wizardy and Mystery where he will not uncover, great adventure but uncover himself as well. J.K. Rowling has done her best work with Harry Potter. 3 of the Harry Potter films have already been finished, with the 3rd film film being released later this year. There is a great special 2 disc dvd for the movie and it includes:<br />* A special interactive tour of Hogwarts <BR>* A special trivia section and Wizard section <BR>* Special DVD Roms features such as a screensaver <BR>* Interviews with Chris Columbus and cast <BR>*Commentary and much more <br />However, the DVD features has it's setbacks for one is it's ''Extra Footage'' of the film. The ''Extra Footage'' are deleted scenes that didn't make the cut of the film. Ordinarly deleted scenes, are put into a special category on a dvd, so users can  see the original film and then see the deleted scenes separately.  I did like the commentary though explaining how tough yet fun it was in bringing Harry Potter to the big screen, obviously when the movie was a successful a box office franchise was born. <br />The franchise of Harry Potter is not limited to the film or books, video games for the Playstation, Gameboy Color and Gameboy Advance all have games of Harry Potter. However, Harry Potter is one the greatest fantasy movies in quite a while and J.K. Rowling has a done great job in bringing it to life.
B0001EFTTM|5.0|I recall seeing this film as a child, around the age of 9 or so, and being scared witless by Max Schreck's Count Orlok.  Schreck's vampyre still remains ultra creepy ~ those long, clawlike hands, those deepset eyes, those scraggly sharp teeth ~ and perhaps my favorite incarnation of the bloodsucking undead.  The photography of the Carpathian countryside is breathtaking, adding authentic atmosphere to the setting.  You are, actually, 'there'.  The special effects are also impressive for the time, and the tinting of the film, I believe, is original.  Many silent films were tinted: blue for night, red for danger, sepia or orange for bright day, green for other effects.  I make a plug for Greta Schroeder, who did an admirable job of pacing distractedly, filled with awful foreboding. I was quite satisified with the choice of soundtracks on the DVD, and my 17-year-old son had a blast switching between them as the mood struck.  You ought to see this at least once ~ it's the one that started them all.
630310696X|5.0|March was Oscar month, and TCM (Turner Classic Movies) who showcase great Oscar movied showed ''Philadelphia'' with Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington .<br />''Philadelphia'' is the powerful movie about a well educated and hardworking lawyer named Andy Beckette who contracts AIDS and is then illegally and prejudicely fired from his law firm when they find out he has AIDS. <br />The movie is nothing short of Excellent demonstrating not only the cold-blooded and  hypocritical members of corporte society, but the indignities and prejudices that people living with AIDS have to go through. <br />The movie also brilliantly shows the courtroom tactics and lies that defendants and lawyers will use in order to win their case. The Defense (who represents the Law Firm who fired Andy Beckette) tries to make Andy Beckett's lifestyle <BR>and often times varying performances at work <BR>against him to try to bring down his reputation and his case. <br />From a law point of view, the movie is Excellent. <BR>From a Film making point of view, the movie is Excellent. <BR>From a societal message , point of view, ''Philadelphia'' is Excellent. <br />Jason Robards, plays Charles Wheeler, a sickening, prejudice man who resembles the most disgusting corporate boss there is: The corporate boss, who pretends to be friends with his coworkers or clients, only to stabbed them  in the back later. He will do only anything to benefit himself. <br />At the beginning, Wheeler pretends to be Andy's friend, heck he even ask him for legal advice on a special antitrust case called ''Highlite vs. Sander Systems''.  Andy Beckett's becomes fired, from the job, once they find out he has aids, but try to make it look he was fired for other reasons. The movie also greatly shows the prejudices, and misconception people have about aids.<br />However, Director Jonathan Demme does bring up some controversial areas for example Andy was a guy with many sexual partners, and so his diagnosis of the Aids Virus while dating Miguel Alvarez (Antonio Banderas) is not surprising<BR>at all. In fact the defense uses Andy's personal history against him very well. <br />Denzel Washington plays Jospeh Miller, the lawyer Beckette eventually to try to bring his AIDS case to court. <BR>Miller himself, at first, displays his own prejudices against people with AIDS. When  Beckette, touches items in his office, his face becomes terrified, showing his fear and ignorance that perhaps he will catch AIDS from Beckette. <br />Another gritty scene that shows people ignorance and prejudice is the library scene in which Andy Beckette, is conducting researching for his AIDS case against the lawfirm that illegally fired him.  The librarian in the library, first asks Andy Beckette, if he would be more comfortable in a study room, but then it becomes evident that the the ignorant librarian is telling not asking Andy Beckette to go to another room. <BR>Andy being, a very proud man, refuses showing his true dignity even while having AIDS. <br />Joseph Miller (Washington) eventually agrees to become Andy's lawyer and this is where more powerful scenes are shown along with brilliant and well scripted performances. <BR>''Justice is blind regardless of color, sex and religion.'' is the line that the Judge in the case uses to ensure the parties involved that this will be a fair case.  ''Philadelphia'' gathered many Oscar Nominations including Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Supporting Actor leading to Denzel Washington winning for Best Actor. <br />''Philadelphia'' is not the only movie that deals with the issue of AIDS, but it is by far one of the best made. <br />I Highly Recommended this movie for both educational reasons (educate people about AIDS along with the ignorant misconception people have about it), and for Journalistic and Filmmaking reasons. <br />An Oscar worthy film that has to be seen.<br />There is a dvd available for ''Philadelphia'' but unfortunately no, special features are given but still a great film.
0140288503|3.0|Mark Bowden's story is an excellent retelling of the events of that day in 1993, but it only tells half the story.  I don't think he even realized he was telling only part, even though he did try to get Somali voices in it.  The real other half, which he does not seem to have a clue about, is that the whole event was a trap, an ambush coordinated and managed by Bin Laden and the Islamists in Sudan and Iran (see Y. Bodansky's book, Bin Laden, The Man Who Declared War on America).  Isn't the author even curious about how, without any warning, all of these snipers and other armed individuals knew to be where the US soldiers were at that particular time?  Mogadishu was and is a pretty lawless place, but even there I doubt that most areas have that many RPG launchers in one place all the time, just in case US soldiers drop in.  The lack of adequate intelligence then and now, has led to the vulnerability of Western nations to terrorism.  That and an unwillingness to admit that anyone could hate the US enough to ambush its soldiers, as well as putting hundreds of innocent civilians in the line of fire.  Unfortunately, the US did not learn in Mogadishu, at the Khobar Towers, on the USS Cole, or even the WTC bombing in 1993.  But it did learn on Sept. 11th.<br />This book is very good in many ways.  But the complete story of these events in Mogadishu has yet to be told.
B00005ALNH|5.0|CliffHanger made in 1993 is one of the most exciting action films on screen. The stunts and location in the movie are unbelievable.<br />It stars Sylvester Stallone as Gabriel Walker, and (Michael Rooker)as Hal Tucker as 2 climbing experts whose friendship comes to an end, when Tucker's girlfriend , Sarah<BR>falls to her death while climbing when Gabe tries to rescue her. Tucker blames Walker for the accident and hasn't forgiven him ever since.<br />Jess Dieghan ( Janine Turner) plays Gabriel girlfriend and coworker on these hi-risk rock climbing jobs.<br />The basic plot in CliffHanger is that a group of terrorists led by a madman named Qualin (John Lighgow) are stealing money from the Treasury Department and making their escape through an airplane. Mr. Travers is the Treasury Agent who is assigned the task of showing an FBI agent, Mr. Mateson, how to find the sum of money that was stolen from Treasury department. However, Mr. Mateson's true job is to find the traitor inside the Treasury Department. It just so happens that Mr. Mateson, is on the same airplane that the terrorist, and the traitor<BR>is, and in a really great scene, blows away a couple of the terrorists and puts their plan to steal the money on hold.<br />Eventually, Mr. Qualin and his remaining terrorists friends escape, but not before the money they stole gets tossed into the icy mountains below them. Qualin and his friends, stranded on the mountains, and angry about losing their money, come up a with a plan to get back.<br />They pretend to be stranded on the mountains, and call in a rescue team to get them, and to eventually force them to get their money.<br />The rescue team answers and you guessed it, it's Gabe Walker and his ex friend Hal Tucker who answer the call.<BR>Now the action really stars and Gabe, and his friends must try to find a way to stop the madman Qualin and his terrorists.<BR>There are really some amazing stunts in Cliffhanger. There are great action scenes, including a big avalanche scene, there is also a great scene in which Gabe literally<BR>surfs on the ice while avoiding the machine gun bullets of the terrorists chasing them.<br />Stallone's character, Gabe is also a very smart guy, he comes up with some pretty good plans to foil Qualin's plan, while at the same time using his strong muscles as an added weapon. Stallone is his usual calm and cool self, delivering the smart, but lethal Walker, and gives his character some depth throughout the movie.<br />John Lighgow is also great as Qualin. Litghow has made a good career playing the psycho. In the memorable Ricochet, his acting as the psychotic left a lasting impression with me.<br />Now there's probably some people who already have seen Cliffhanger before, but the DVD delivers the movie in a way you haven't seen before<br />Dvd features:<br />* Trailer<BR>*Special look at the special<BR>effects of the movie<BR>*Deleted scenes<br />The movie was directed by Renny Harlin, another one of those directors that don't get the spotlight but who have directed many blockbuster movies including:<br />*Die Hard 2 <BR>*Driven<br />Furthermore, the hits that Harlin has directed have been made into<BR>games: Cliffhanger was made for the Sega Genesis, Supernes and Gameboy. The games for it, are actually pretty good. Likewise Die Hard 2 was made for the pc and Playstation, along with Driven for the Gameboy Advance.<br />So Cliffhanger is an awesome movie, and now with the special DVD for it, it's definitely worth seeing once again.
B00000IQW3|4.0|One of the fondest memories of my childhood was watching this movie while eating a Chef-Boy-Ardee sausage pizza. (remember those?) Many hot summer days were spent enjoying the adventure of Alex Rogan travelling to Rylos and realizing his dreams and his destiny as a Starfighter with his navigator, Grigg. This is one of those inexplicably optimistic films that popped up in the 80's. Despite the fact that the special effects may look dated now, the story is timeless and well written for this genre. The video presentation on this DVD is rather crisp and clear but the audio could be a \\"little\\" better. Still, this is a wonderful film for kids and nostalgic adults alike. Oh, the extras are nice as well. I hadn't seen the \\"Making of\\" documentary since it appeared on HBO when I was a kid. This is a wonderful film.
B0000028RR|5.0|I have to say, listening to Linkin Park, P.O.D, etc, RATM is by far the best rap/metal band out there. Alot of rap/metal bands just talk about sex drugs and stuff cough*, cough*, Limp Bizket, cough*. But Rage is differnt they talk about right and wrong. Zack De la Rocha is one of the most respected people out there for his political opinions on our US Government, his lyrics are expreesed in various amounts of anger in hardcore rap. Tom morello, 1 word, AMAZING, his guitar playing is crazy. And would you believe that most of these cool sounds are made by guitar, thats awesome. Timmy C with the bass, very good, the bass blends perfect with the guitar. And Brad wilk, another jaw dropper, his drumming is also amzing, when you listen to all the tracks, the drum pattern is perfect. There Self titled debut is filled with lots of great rap, guitar solos, and plenty of screaming.<br />1)Bombtrack (4:05) - great opener to the album, also a nice intro too. 8/10<br />2)Killing in the Name (5:14) - After listening to this track I was amazed, great song to listen to when you're pissed off, my third fav. track. 10/10<br />3)Take the Power Back (5:37) - a very political song with some great lyrics. 8/10<br />4)Settle for Nothing (4:48) - not my favorite but still good. Has a cool guitar solo. 7/10<br />5)Bullet in the Head (5:09)- cool guitar, another great track one of my favorite. 8/10<br />6)Know Your Enemy (4:55)- cool lyrics, and great guitar riffs. 9/10<br />7)Wake Up (6:04)- first heard it in the matrix, another great guitar, best lyrics. 10/10<br />8)Fistful of Steel (5:31)- meh, ok. 6/10<br />9)Township Rebellion (5:24)- meh, ok. 6/10<br />10)Freedom (6:05) - An excellent way to finish the album, my favorite track. 12/10<br />In all, out of all the best RATM albums pick this up first then move up to there other ones, Evil Empire, Battle of L.A, Renegades, and Live at the Grand Olympic Auditorium.
B000059H99|5.0|AN UNKNOWN PHILADELPHIA CLUB BOXER NAMED ROCKY BALBOA [SYLVESTER STALLONE] GETS A SHOT AT WORLD HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPION APOLLO CREED [CARL WEATHERS]. THIS IS THE ULTIMATE UNDERDOG MOVIE. STALLONE, IN THE BEST ROLE OF HIS CAREER, DOES WONDERFUL AS ROCKY. BURGESS MEREDITH ALSO DOES GOOD AS ROCKY'S TRAINER. THIS MOVIE IS ONE OF THE GREATEST MOVIES EVER MADE. I RECCOMEND THIS MOVIE TO ANY MOVIE FAN THAT HASEN'T SEEN IT YET. THIS MOVIE WON A FEW OSCARS, INCLUDING ONE FOR BEST PICTURE. FOLLOWED BY FOUR SEQUELS. RUMOR HAS IT THAT THERE MAY BE A ROCKY VI COMING OUT.
B00005JM0B|2.0|This movie wasn't terrible.  It was about on par with your average big-budget summer blockbuster.  But as pointed out by other reviewers, the plot is lacking.  Considering the special effects capability of modern film, they could have done a much more entertaining film by making a precursor - a grim future where the humans fight to send Kyle Reese back to protect Sarah Connor would have been interesting, at least.  This film feels more like a rehash of the second movie, with only minor deviations from that plotline (take the same terminator, send it after John Connor, but this time instead of knives and stabbing weapons, give it a gun, and make it female).  I'd call it the worst in the terminator series.  I still bought it just to own the triology, but as a standalone film its just not very good.

B0001Z363W|5.0|a true sdmf'er will love this album, goes from mellow to all hell on the solos with zakk's blistering penatonic wizardy!!!! zakk wylde is a true musician and it shows on all his cd's. a must have for any zakk wylde fan!!!!!!!!!!! buy it and let the music speak for itself.
B000002MP2|3.0|Fun lightweight pop-punk.  Nothing terribly interesting or in any way groundbreaking, but not horrible either.  I'd burn a copy, no way would I pay for it. To call these guys punk is ridiculous.  They're very mainstream in terms of attitude and desire for acceptance.  If these guys had showed up at a Black Flag concert back in the day they would have had their arms and legs ripped off and thrown in a pile.  This is safe enough for your 13 year old daughter and makes for a pleasant listen when driving your kids to and from soccer practice.
B0002234LS|1.0|This movie has one redeeming quality, well two. Depp ain't bad and the ground level premise of the two stories &quot;The Secret Window&quot; being similiar ain't bad either, but beyond that, what we have here is a monstrous mess. Whoever cast the role of the Mississippi 'guy', the townsfolk, the maid, the sheriff, etc., should now be unemployed. Awful acting, hammy, and anything else you can dream up that is b-a-d. Extras? When a movie is this poorly made, who cares. I found my local rental store has this movie miscategorized, it should be under comedy. If you are still looking for a 'new' suspense/horror movie on par with the Ring, keep looking.
B00003CX9S|5.0|I saw the original in 1980, and the DVD in 2004. The DVD really is a nice package. Not only do you have this great film in crystal clear quality, but the interview package at the end is really informative, especially regarding the makeup and how the screenplay was discovered -- the producer's babysitter handed him her boyfriend's script! John Hurt's insights were particularly interesting; there are so many things that could have torpedoed the project but thankfully didn't.<br />I only wish David Lynch could have been interviewed, as this was his first major project after Eraserhead and he really matured in terms of being able to work in a major production with so many shining talents.
B000286RKW|5.0|This just happens to be my favorite movie of all time.  And I'm so excited about having a 2-disc SE.  Finally!!<BR>Before I saw this movie, I had already loved Robert DeNiro's acting, and Martin Scorsese's directing.  Where DeNiro is always flawless (as he is here), Scorsese really took it to the next level.  <BR>The actors perform brilliantly, the writing is top-notch, the narration by Ray Liotta is perfect, the violence is shocking and not over-done.  And the music is unbelievable.  I wish the soundtrack was also getting the 2-disc treatment.  <BR>This is one film that desperately needed a Special Edition, not only to satisfy is large fan-base, but to improve on the two-sided DVD that is out there now.  One should never have to flip a DVD over half-way through the movie.  <BR>If you like \\"The Sopranos,\\" you're gonna absolutely love this.  Then again, if you like \\"The Sopranos,\\" you've certainly already seen \\"Goodfellas.\\"  <BR>But, \\"The Sopranos\\" ain't got nothin' on \\"Goodfellas.\\" <BR>I strongly recommend this movie!!!

B000001DYA|5.0|Blue Cheer is unfortunately one of the most underestimated bands ever. People say SAbbath invented heavy. Forget it, Blue Cheer, where the first that ever did heavy metal. So much noise, so much talent. Their debut album Vincebus Eruptum, is so immense, with so many genius songs. My personal favorite is \\"Out Of Focus\\".<br />Leigh Stephens guitar sound is so high, and cool. Ive never heard anything like it.<br />And by the way, not only oldies listen to this music. im 16 right now, listened to them since i was 14
B000024D4R|5.0|animals was a vastly underrated album which was good in its own right along with the wall,meddle and the dark side of the moon.highly recommended to all rock fans.five stars
B00005JLR8|4.0|This story is about a Irish immigrant family in New York in the 1980s.  They have little money but there's lots of love in their household.  The father, played by Paddy Considine, is an actor who drives a cab between going on auditions.  The mother, played by Samantha Morton, used to be a teacher, but now takes a job in an ice cream parlor.  The two children, played by Sarah and Emma Bolger (two real-life sisters from Ireland) are smart and sweet and lovable.  The whole family is mourning the death of a third child who died at a young age after years of suffering with a brain tumor.<br /><br />The only housing they can find is a huge walk-up apartment in a run-down druggie infested building which is supposed to be East Harlem.  The family is poor but surprisingly cheerful and happy to be in America.  Some of their experiences are humorous such as when the father tries to install a cheap air conditioner.  Some made me hold my breath, such as when he tries to win the little girl a doll at a carnival and bets all the rent money.  And then there is their strange neighbor, played by Djimon Housau, a Nigerian artist who is carrying an awful burden but who lets the little girls warm his heart.<br /><br />The urban setting seemed almost real. And so did the family's problems.  But somewhere along the line I grew a little tired of their constant positive outlook.  And there where parts of the film where it just seemed too much like a soap opera and much too maudlin for my tastes.<br /><br />However, this is an uplifting film.  And it shows the sunshine side of the immigrant experience. The acting is outstandingly good.  It's well paced and has a positive message.  And for that I do recommend it.
B00008CLOA|5.0|thee dark side of the moon was the swan song and without any doubt their best album along with the wall.this great album should be there in your collection. five stars.
B0001L3LUE|5.0|This film reminds us what documentaries can be.  Errol Morris never gets in the way of letting Robert McNamara tell his story.  Michael Moore produces films.  \\"the Fog of War\\" proves Morris is a documentary master.
B00008CLOA|5.0|list of mature bands include floyd,led zeppelin,the band,yes,kansas,ac/dc and elp.list of immature crappy musicians include,britney,kylie,n sync,justin timberlake and janet jackson.choose the rock bands and avoid the pop artists if you are mature.this album is great buy it!!!!!!!.
B000009QO6|5.0|This is the debut album that started one of the world's most prominent heavy metal bands, Danzig. Formed by ex-Misfits singer Glenn Danzig, with his trademark down-tuned drawl, Danzig explored the darker side of blues metal. And although some later efforts may be very well done, he and his band never really outdid this, and it remains a classic to this day.
B00004R99R|4.0|Precisely BECAUSE of the complete disregard for the original mythology, this movie is a superb teaching tool for middle schoolers.  After a unit on Mythology, the kids can identify for themselves the many creative changes Disney opted to make, and even better, they can figure out for themselves why Disney made those choices.  It makes the kids savvier media consumers, they enjoy spotting the &quot;mistakes,&quot; and the music is terrific and holds their attention.  We all enjoy the fact that nearly every time the Muses sing &quot;and that's the Gospel truth!&quot; they're referencing something completely FALSE.  And the group scene at the christening makes a great &quot;test&quot; of those symbolic identifiers--the kids like being able to identify the gods and goddesses based on the clues in their appearance.
B00008WT5E|5.0|This is one of the seemingly countless albums that are SO underrated (Such as South Of Heaven, Ram It Down, and Psycho Circus). Although I do like Brian Johnson as a singer better than Bon, that doesn't mean this is not a good album. All the songs are good, in true AC/DC style and with those little sounds in Angus' guitar that makes you go &quot;Oh, yeah, that's an AC/DC song&quot;, even though youv'e never heard it before. Whatever, all the songs are great and I feel this is one of the most underrated albums ever.
B00003CXA2|5.0|One of the greatest movies in History,  Forrest Gump is the story of a slow man from Alabama who winds up in all kinds of historic and amazing events and to him,  its no big deal.  Hanks is the standout throughout and this Academy Award winning performance put him in the same class as Jimmy Stewart and Marlon Brando as one of the greatest actors of this or any other generation.  From Football star,  to War Hero,  to Shrimping Tycoon,  Forrest does it all.<br />     Youll laugh,  youll cry,  youll love Forrest Gump.  A must have!!!
B0000BYM3K|5.0|This band is just UNSTOPPABLE! They are one of THE heavy metal bands, their influence on heavy metal will always be felt, even in years and years. And this is their best yet! Yeah, you heard me, better than Number Of The Beast, better than Killers. Just every song thrust unbelievable metallic power into it. Bruce &quot;The Air Raid Siren&quot; Dickinson's voice is just as powerful and heavy as ever, and that impressive guitar lineup, well, what can I say? Get this album from the band that will always be my favorite.
B0000640S1|5.0|I remember seeing this movie for the first time on July 4, 1984. I know back then I was into long hair, and alot of 60's and 70's music. Didn't do acid, or any drugs as I was 16, and grew up in a police officer's house. I always knew police brutality existed, but after this movie I suddenly realized that men in short hair aren't always the good guys. I mean after all there are no pictures of the devil with long hair, or at least from what I've seen. I know watching this movie I've developed a intense prejudice of hick folks, and country bumpkins, and the such as I feel that they are self-righteous, and know it alls, and that they are God. I know that the only other people in movies that rubbed me the wrong way were Sherrif Buford T. Justice from &quot;Smokey and the Bandit&quot;, and the corrupt sherrif who smacked around his deputy in the movie &quot;Tank&quot;. However, don't get me wrong the same way that Sherrif Teasle, and crew are accountable so is Rambo. Rambo still is accountable for murdering an officer of the law even though it was self-defense. He'd have to go to court, and prove it as such. The Veitnam war no doubt has ruffled alot of feathers, and in my opinion while I understand why some ran away to Canada I also understand why some went there. I can only imagine what the soldiers went through there as I was only a baby when this was all going on. Like all veterans of all the wars the Veitnam Veterans should've been given dignity, and respect all along for fighting to keep our freedom. Mind you I'd have to start digging for the whole 30 year war over there, and why it impacted us so much. The same way I feel that the laws back here are to be respected, and a police officer should be given the same dignity, and respect as that of a soldier who went overseas to fight. I know one phrase was powerful when Teasle said &quot;That if a prisoner is mistreated, by a deputy he brings it to him, and then Teasle(him) goes to the deputy, and that's how the law works&quot;, but what happens when the head vigilanty is your Sherrif? Overall this movie should've made America reflect on how we reacted, and treated these brave soldiers when they returned from Veitnam, and come to grips with our actions, and our attitudes. However, America missed the boat by glorifying Rambo for all the wrong reasons, and diffused the character, and the message. They made Rambo a gun toting vigilanty, and that was America's new superhero. Rambo wanted no war. He wanted to visit his friend, and became heartbroken when he found out his friend was dead. All Rambo wanted was a hot meal, and a chance to grieve before moving on; who knows Rambo may had found peace for once in Holidayland, but now it's citizens will never know as Prejudice was standing at the door when Rambo knocked. To me America is still acting that way, and it's time to forgive, and reconcile, and move on.
6304698526|5.0|Ignore the paisley pajamas, Steve McQueen was an icon of cool and BULLITT is the proof.  Peter Yates has a smart thinking man's cop drama, bolstered by (yes) the best chase scene on film.  Great locations in San Francisco.  Superior acting by McQueen, Robert Vaughn as a sinister U.S. Senator and Don Gordon, as McQueen's partner.  Why didn't Don Gordon become a bigger star?
B0001ZX0OW|1.0|Now, in Smellarama!  Sean Penn IS the owner of a convenience store.   Tim Robbins IS a kinda flakey blue collar gentle giant type guy who got sexually worked over as a kid.  Susan Sarandon IS... oh, wait, somehow they didn't squeeze Baghdad Sue inno the flick.  Though I believe I did see Fidel Castro in a supporting role.  I believe he will soon win an Oscar simply for BEING Fidel Castro.  And Ed Asner has a brief role as the airplane mechanic.  <BR>But seriously folks, is it really plausible for any of these spoiled rotten Hollywood actors to ever play real people anymore?  While the rest of us slave away actually BEING real people, these hams sit around saying things like, \\"Well, yes Jay, in order to prepare for the demanding role as a convenience store clerk, I actually worked as a clerk in a 7-11 for three months, I did (total BS)\\"  \\"Oh, really, Sean?  What was that like?\\"  \\"Oh, it was really grounding, you know, I mean to like, BE there behind the counter selling people stuff and making sure teenagers didn't vandalize the video games it was... (begins to cry unconvincingly) It was a deep experience... please.... just give me a minute...\\"<BR>See, as someone who has actually got his back to the wall with the pressures of ordinary life pressing in relentlessly, I resent the implication that these actors can by now remember the slightest thing about what it is like to live an ordinary, unglamorous, difficult life.  I read an article not so long ago about a little baby who was violently shaken by his father and will probably be brain damaged for the rest of his life.  Where's this kid's Oscar?  Where's HIS Golden Globe?
B00004ZB9D|4.0|I just love Lenny's music and find him a very intriguing and somewhat spiritual human being. His songs can be very soothing, intense, emotional and some are quite sexy, like Lenny himself. The two songs on this one that press my buttons, and which happen to be very different from one another are \\"It Ain't Over Till It's Over\\" and \\"Let Love Rule\\". This is one of my chill out cds. Enjoy!

B00005JNA2|4.0|I have not seen the original film, but went to see this one based on some strong critical reviews.  This film is very well crafted and there is a honest quality about it.  Overall, I liked the film and found it thought provoking.<br />That said, I didn't particularly like either one of the characters.  I find Ethan Hawke a little too intellectual, and July Delpy a little too cold - and both are way too self-absorbed...  But they both give fine and (again) very honest performances, which I appreciated very much.  So if you like both of them, you'll probably enjoy this film.<br />I agree with the other reviewer who applauded the ending.  I think it's the way it ended that lead me to give this movie 4-stars.<br />All in all, I thought this was a very good film.
B0000AGWJ7|5.0|I'm not biased in my opion of the these guys because I just heard this album for the first time.  I'm 28, so I have heard my share of metal bands come and go.  I was pleasantly surprised when I heard Waken the Fallen.  It blew me away!  These guys know how to write songs.  I believe they do have a European Metal sound to their songs.  Guitars are a cross between Maiden and At the Gates.  The vocals are very good, but sometimes M.Shadows clean vocals sound a bit too pretty(i.e. Incubus).  I really disagree with Mr. Greg from Australia, because there is better talent in the Metal world.  The solos are very good, but I've heard better (try Jeff Loomis of Nevermore).  I hope Greg owns more than A7X cd's... <BR> <BR>Overall, their combination of influences sound great.  I've listened to mostly European metal bands for a while now becuase most of them know melody and haven't been watered down with trendy American crap.  These guys are a new hope for us.  They're a young band and they are only going to get better!!
B0002BO0AS|4.0|Unearth has quickly become known as a punishing and aggressive metalcore bands and &quot;The Oncoming Storm&quot; only helps to solidify that image. However, this release finds the band exploring new sonic space and as a result, the album feels like Unearth has grown since their last release. Even though &quot;The Oncoming Storm&quot; is a step forward, it doesn't really do enough to put itself on the level above its predecessor &quot;The Stings of Conscience,&quot; but it certainly stays on par and with new weapons to add to their arsenal, ultimately does make it a fine follow-up album. <br />The same things that grabbed people's ears and ripped them to bloody shreds on the previous album are still here: the aggressive vocals, the all-out drumming assault, the sharp guitar lines, and most importantly, the punishing breakdowns. Certainly this provides more than enough thunder for Unearth's storm. However, what is oncoming is the new dynamic the band has found on the album. The hints of melody found on the last disc have now come full circle and really helps to make this album shine. The guitar work is more certainly more Gothenberg-esque, but it is not a complete, direct translation either. The band's guitar duo simply uses that influence as a foundation and builds upon it with their own unique flavor. This is some of the best guitar work you will find on a metal album this year and will establish the duo of Buz McGrath and Ken Susi as one of metal's best. The rest of the band remains solid on the record, all of them having fine tuned their craft a bit since the last album as well. The vocalist Trevor Phipps is really finding his voice and anytime a screamer can set himself apart from the rest of the pack, you know you are dealing with someone special. A 6th person also has to take some credit for the album's success - Killswitch Engage's Adam Dutkiewicz handled all the production and mixing of the album, which no doubt has made a dramatic impact on the band's sound. It makes Unearth truly feel like the metal juggernaut that they are.<br />The songs that tend to standout on this release are those in which the band is trying something new, which seems only natural. &quot;This Lying World&quot; captures much of what this entire album embodies, mixing the trademark Unearth assault with the band's added melodic-touches, all topped off with a breakdown that will make this one a real crowd pleaser. The album's best track is undoubted track five, &quot;Zombie Autopilot,&quot; which actually seems to start in the previous track with a beautiful acoustic line that serves as a bridge between it and the previous track. The band is just on top of everything on this track and features a full-band reprise of the acoustic interlude that precedes the song. &quot;Lie To Purify&quot; is almost as strong, featuring the band exploring more of the melodic territory, but still maintaining the trucelent sound they have become known for. &quot;Endless,&quot; appears here after being the title track off the EP the band released between this disc and the last one. The added production has smoothed out and rough edges and really makes this track stand out above the pack. Towards the end of the album is &quot;Predetermined Sky,&quot; which like &quot;This Lying Sky,&quot; combines the more traditional Unearth ferocity with some of their new weapons.<br />Overall, this is a very strong CD and should put Unearth on the map in the American metal scene. I hesitate to give this disc a 5-star rating as it really doesn't raise the bar set on &quot;The Stings of Conscience&quot; high enough, but it does perhaps give a glimpse of where the band is headed. Should they continue on their current course, the next album should really be the defining moment for Unearth. Knowing what lies in the future, there may not be a more appropriate album title than &quot;The Oncoming Storm&quot; as there is something big brewing in the distance for Unearth.
0671027344|3.0|Perks of Being a Wallflower is a nice book. It's sweet and funny. It has interesting characters, and a compelling (although rather lifeless) plot. It was a smooth, easy, enjoyable read. But if this book is a life-changer, than I'm Roseanne Barr. <br />Firstly, the author tried way too hard to create an anti-hero. Instead of creating a sensitive boy, Charlie (our narrator) is a sniveling little pussy. What 15-year-old does not know what masturbation is? Or oral sex? Charlie seems to have been locked in a box for his entire childhood, and although he's not without his touching moments, I found myself wanting to punch him in the face more often than not. <br />The writing style is interesting, and different, and it definitely keeps your attention, but the book is cliche after cliche. Charlie is socially retarded, and you'll find yourself laughing at his mishaps in love and life. But all in all, it's just MTV's latest attempt to control the lives of youth. Perks is Donnie Darko on paper. A complex and mediocre film transformed into a phenomenon by youth searching for something to cling to.
B0001ZMWQO|5.0|brilliant debut album. Catchy and original. It's kind've the new millenium Wire mixed with talking heads. But dont get me wrong these lads are for real. I'm interested to see where they take it from here. Four star album but i'm giving it a 5 to counter some idiotic 1 star votes.
0743243315|2.0|It just goes on and on and goes nowhere. I don't care about the characters. The sister's letters are a chore to read and I end up saying, &quot;so what?&quot; I generally enjoy reading about other cultures and was really looking forward to this one because of all the hype.<BR>What a huge disappointment.
0156027321|2.0|Having read the book, I have no idea why so many people rave over it.  It is not bad as such, I just don't think it stands out. In fact it is really quite tedious at times.<br />I will however say that the very end of the story did get me thinking about what I had been reading - but only out of curiosity as to what happened.

After all, this film is described as &quot;Hilarious&quot; by Rolling Stone or something. &quot;Two Thumbs Up&quot;!<br />Well are you in for a slow-moving piece of mood music. Yes, if you keep in mind that it's about loneliness, etc. and there's a great performance by Bill Murray, and you have a couple of hours to kill without wanting any recompense, go ahead and watch it. It does succeed in immersing you in its molasses-paced arthouse study of whatever it is the critics said it was a study of, but it's hardly hilarious.<br />Sure, Murray might have turned in a great performance. But so what? It's like following a complete stranger around for a week, and not a terribly interesting one at that. His subtle performance is stretched out over too much time.<br />You might have guessed I don't have much patience for movies that don't go anywhere in two hours. You might also have guessed I'm not paid to watch stuff like this, but instead have to pay for the privilege. All I know is, I didn't enjoy it much, and I want my money back.
B000002UAR|3.0|The album called Revolver broke a lot of ground on the music scene back in the year 1966 and to this day is an influential album. The guitar sound the Beatles achieved here has been very influential and some of the material sounds very 90's / 2000's! Definitely isn't a dated album.     You know, how come there aren't more George Harrison songs? I'm not that crazy about 'I want to tell you' but 'Taxman' and 'Love you to' ( I think it's meant to be 'Love to you' but they were so innovative they swapped it around) are my favourite things here. 'Taxman' sounds like an oldie, you know, rock n roll, but is catchy, memorable, and has an hilarious lyric, rather than being shrouded in vague mysticism. 'Love to you' flat out rocks, what with that insistent beat, backwards distortion, excellent Sitar playing, a real winner! Paul's Elanor Rigby is a brilliant song, not so crazy about the lyrics but the orchestral arrangement and wonderful melody make it. He also contributes a beautiful ballad with gorgeous vocal harmonies, 'Here there and everywhere'. John, meanwhile, gives us 'I'm only sleeping'. It's kind of folk-psychedelia with lyrics that allude to a new way of thinking about society, basically a continuation of the 'nowhere man' theme. In fact the album does have some social commentary, as well as some more obtuse lyrcism, maybe drug influenced (She said she said). Then, of course, the album closes with 'Tomorrow never knows', where do they come up with this stuff, so rad and out there, and so brilliant.    But aside from these six songs, a lot of the other material is considerably weaker. Okay, 'Yellow Submarine' is ok, but so what... 'She said she said', I know it's influential and all, but it really can make you feel dead when listening to it, and I don't mean that in a psychedelic way! 'Doctor Robert' and 'And your bird can sing' aren't all that great, but particularly the second one, they are fun to listen to, and isn't that what music is all about? Some fun? 'Got toget you into my life', this is brass-driven 60's pop, and it's awesome, so much enthusiasm, and great melody too. There are a couple of other songs that are just ok and one not so.    In summary, yes, this is an innovative, influential album, but the juice is really only contained in a few songs, and there's a sag about two thirds the way through the album where there is a cluster of weaker songs. Not bad songs (except one, can you guess?) but not particularly good. I'd say it's worth 3.0 - 3.5 stars.
0156421178|5.0|Ever wonder what it is like be shot right through the neck? Ever wonder what it is like to stare over open sights at an enemy soldier with his pants down (literally) relieving himself? Would you shoot? Ever wonder what it is like to fight with allies that may be as worse than the common enemy? <br />Orwell experienced all of this and more as a member of one of the more obscure Spanish militias fighting for the Spanish Republic during the bloody internecine Spanish Civil War. He also became incredibly dissillusioned in the process. Finding his beliefs in revolutionary socialism, he was already jaded by communism and the cynical use it was put to serve Stalin's interests. He opted for a more loose organisation and therefore choose to enroll with the Anarcho-Syndicalists as a foreign volunteer in the Spanish Civil War. His particular group was called the POUMists (an acronym that I need not summarize here). <br />Ill-equipped and with no training, they showed what raw idealism can do against Franco and his fascist oppression -- they stopped fascism cold on the battle field and were never found wanting in terms of courage. What did defeat them was the United Front launched by the Cominterm against International Fascism. For those that did not tow the line, Stalin's advisors and compadours inside the Spanish Communist Party sacrificed. Denied weapons, ammunition and food, the coalition --- made up a broad spectrum of liberal-democrats, progressives, socialists, communists, anarchists (and every shade between) --- were defeated in piece-meal battles. Orwell was shaped and scarred by the experience. Although always a social progressive, he realised that idealism in its most extreme forms could be as bad as the fascism one was fighting against. This shaped his eternal mistrust of Communism (but not as some rightist's bizaarly claim, push him into being some kind of conservative demigod).<br />This book has it all: a trenchent analysis of political history, a serious war biography, a good slice of military narrative, and a chronicle of idealist growth, development and abandoning of a former way of thinking... <br />Without a doubt one of my top 5 war biographies and one of the top 25 reads of my entire life, so far....
B0000C8AW2|5.0|There are three great 70s Dylan albums: Blood on the Tracks, Desire, and this one.  All are equally good in their own ways. I won't say anything more!!    I see that a few people disagree with me on this, but I still fell strongly that Street Legal is a fantastic album. EVERY BIT AS GOOD as Blood on the tracks, Desire, and the great 60s albums.
630170648X|5.0|Too bad this movie isn't better known than the weak Mel Brooks remake of the same name.  Jack Benny as that great, great stage actor, Josef Tura (world famous throughout Poland!), and Carole Lombard are hilarious.  Aside from the first couple of minutes, the whole movie is a laugh riot.  Amazing how well the script and performances have stood the test of time.  Truly one of the greatest comedies of the 40s!  Best lines:  \\"So they call me Concentration Camp Airhart, eh?\\" and \\"What he did to Shakespeare, we are now doing to Poland.\\" and \\"To be or not to be ...\\"  Rent it, borrow it, buy it -- whatever you do, watch it.  You'll love it.  <br />Time to produce a DVD version with commentary track.
B000001FND|4.0|My favorite songs on this cd happen to be the 3 weirdest named ones; Birdie Told Me, The Earnest of Being George, and Lemons Never Forget. That 2nd one, I don't have a slight idea wut it means, but it has a cool beat to it. Birdie Told Me and Lemons Never Forget are mid-paced songs and they're both catchy. The #1 hit &quot;Massachusetts&quot; is boring to me. It just ain't my style. But World is. Robin does great and that song. Maurice's song is With The Sun In My Eyes. Good tune, but not much variety in it. The Change Is Made is ok, but it seems like a hard attempt of a rock song. Really And Sincerely is pretty ok. It seems like all of their albums have one slow, sad song by Robin. Harry Braff is the weird one on this cd and the chorus has an odd tune that keeps going up and down and somehow makes it ok to listen to. Daytime Girl is short but good. And The Sun Will Shine is great. I like the way they set up the chorus and outro that leads to the verses. The album ends with Horizontal, a pretty nice little tune. So not a bad album at all for their 2nd one.
0671027344|5.0|I can understand why people wouldn't like this book. If you can't relate to something, of course you'll think it's crap. Parts about it not being plausible is a little off, though. I listened to that type of music as a freshman, I want through some of the same things he did. And while I wasn't able to deal with it as he did, I made along fine. And before you start, I'm a Senior now, further from the time of those genres than he was.<BR>I highly suggest this to people to read. Mind you, I was about to burn it when I found out it was a MTV book, but I ended up liking it.<BR>Life is so much easier when you find something to relate to.<BR>By the by, I LOVED Patrick.
B000267JQK|5.0|I will first admit that I didn't purchase the original version of Disclaimer as I only got into Seether about 4 months ago. So after hearing that it was to be re-released with extra songs and a DVD I thought I would wait for that. Upon receiving this on the day of release, I stuck it straight into my CD player and cranked it up. Being a Nirvana fan, I can make some comparisons along the lines of they sound rather similair. For me, the best songs are Gasoline, Fine Again, Driven Under, Sympathetic and Broken (with Amy Lee). This is probably the first album that I own with which I have no alarms toward any song - they are all absolutely brilliant ! Now I suppose I shall wait until 2005 for the proper follow-up and if it is anything like Disclaimer (musically), then I can't wait. Also - I have heard a lot of people compare Seether to Staind. All I can say to that is that apart from 'Break The Cycle', Staind are yet to produce anything of any quality - whereas Seether have managed it with their first try and hopefully Seether's next album will be just as good.
B0001CCXZW|5.0|This just makes me want to see all the seasons on DVD!
B00000DSEN|5.0|This was my first metal album, and i'm really glad it was. I think No Prayer for the Dying is a collection of the most underrated Maiden songs ever. Great songs like &quot;Tailgunner&quot;, &quot;No Prayer for the Dying&quot;, &quot;Run Silent, Run Deep&quot; and especially &quot;Mother Russia&quot; are severely underrated gems. &quot;Bring Your Daughter to the Slaughter&quot; is the only song on NPftD that everyone seems to like, excellent song with a great chant-a-long part in the middle. I didn't like all the songs on this album first when i got this years ago. I thought &quot;Public Enema Number One&quot;, &quot;Fates Warning&quot; and &quot;The Assassin&quot; were boring, and i almost hated &quot;Holy Smoke&quot; and &quot;Hooks in You&quot;. I'm glad that these days i can fully enjoy those songs. <br />Great and horribly underrated album with lots of great riffs, drumming and choruses. I suggest everyone gives this album another listen, it deserves it.
B0001CCXZW|5.0|I've been a devoted fan of Gilmore Girls right from the beginning, since I'm the same age as Rory and love watching her go through experiences similar to mine: prep school, heartbreak, starting college, etc. This show is so well-written and acted, and the first season flawlessly presents the relationships between all the characters. It's such a smart show and I can't wait for the release of the following seasons!
015603008X|4.0|&quot;Flowers for Algernon&quot; is one of the most emotional books I have ever read.

B00005N5RM|5.0|Let's not compare Chuck Russell's &quot;revisiting&quot; of the classic 1958 movie which was one of Steve McQueen's first starring roles.  Thirty years of cinematic improvements make a comparison wholly unnecessary and unfair.  THE BLOB, as envisioned by Chuck Russell (Eraser), is a scifi gorefest, with some imaginative effects and its own brand of intense mayhem.<br />A meteor crashes to earth near a small ski-resort town.  The kindly old &quot;can man&quot; finds the crash site, and plays around with some messy looking stuff oozing from the meteor.  This stuff is actually some kind of viral mess that absorbs and spreads like wildfire.  One of the main differences in the two movies is that in this version, is the monster from outer space, or...ha, no spoilers.  Suffice to say, things are not what they seem.<br />The cast is a mixture of good performers and adequate ones.  Good:  Jeffrey DeMunn as the sheriff who has the hots for the town's kindly restaurant owner, played with youthful elegance by Candy Clark (American Graffiti).  Also good:  Art LaFleur as the pharmacist and papa to heroine Shawnee Smith (merely adequate).  Kevin Dillon swaggers like a James Dean wannabe but matures as the picture moves on and he becomes a likely and likeable hero.  Joe Seneca as the mysterious doctor is surprisingly effective in a villainous role for a change, and Donovan Leitch in his little screen time evokes a rare mature teenager.  The scene in the pharmacy where a friend of Leitch's purchases condoms is pretty funny.  As for the horror scenes, they're good:  the blob in the restaurant wherein the cook goes down the drain; the stampede in the movie theater when the blob takes center stage; and the finale with the snow machine.  All well done and effective.  Compared to a lot of really bad horror movies currently going straight to DVD, THE BLOB is a cut above the rest, and remember, there's always rooms for jello!!!
0156421178|5.0|I was put off Orwell at an early age by reading 1984 and Animal Farm, both of which I found terribly depressing.  Thirty years later, I finally got around to reading 'Homage to Catalonia' and I wish I hadn't waited so long because it is absolutely fascinating.  Orwell's account of fighting on the front line during the war is really reamrkable.  It is astonishing to earn what an absolute shambles the war was, with soldiers armed with hopleessly antiquated weapons.  The Republican and Nationalist front lines were so far apart that most of the time they can't even fire at each other, being too far apart to score a hit, so they are reduced to shouting propoganda at each other through megaphones.  I had no idea Orwell could be funny, at times reading this book is like reading a scenario for a farcical comedy. You get a good sense of the privations and squalor of life in the front line, also, surprisingly, the cold (it had honestly never occured to me that Spain was ever cold). There is an incredibly vivivd description of how Orwell felt when he got shot in action.  Away from the front, Orwell is shocked to discover that the Republicans seem to be more interested in fighting each other than the Nationalists.  The Communists begin to act vindictively towards the Trotskyists and members of POUM, the organisation under whose banner Orwell had fought.  He describes his horror as he sees men who had given up everything to go and fight for the Republic, treated as criminals by the Republican army.  There is a very funny scene where he describes how his hotel room is searched by police looking for evidence of subversive activity.  they search the room for about an hour, looking everywhere, but they never touch the bed, because his wife is lying in it, even though,as  Orwell reflects, there could be a ton of Trotskyist literature under the pillow, and machine guns under the mattress.  Hilarious in parts, heartbreaking in others, this is an unforgettable book.
0618526412|4.0|I'm usually pretty suspicious of Oprah's books, but this one came highly recommended from a close friend so I gave it a try.  It was not really what I expected, but turned out to be very enjoyable, which should not be confused with uplifting or happy.  Obviously it is a little depressing, but shouldn't the title have given that away?  I think the one star reviews are from people who didn't really understand what the novel was about.  Maybe they should stick to Dean Koontz.  The Heart... isn't just about race or deafness, although both these topics are handled in a manner that place this novel ahead of its time.  These are only specific examples that should be viewed as a part of the human experience in general.  While it is not on my short list, I think this is a valuable read for anyone who enjoys this type of literature, and if novels about loneliness or the south are not your favorite, read it anyway -- it might surprise you.  It's too bad that this is only now a bestseller a lifetime after it was published.
B00005JM20|2.0|This movie is ok. It probably would be more funny if I were British, since they have such a dry wit.  It kept me interested, not laughing, by interested in seeing how it ended. Probably never watch it again but at least I don't feel as though I've wasted a few hours of my life watching it.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Finally a CD not too hard undertanding. Brintey a true rock star. She to be around long long time. Favorite songs mine: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,11,10,12,13. She not lip-synching on this CD, that for sure! CD cover very nice, good picture. She advance much on this CD. I agree people being mean they to say CD not good. Her true talent shine through, should be number one every where!
B00005B534|5.0|IF you like bands like symphony x or rhapsody you will love these guys. stephan forte the guitarist has some great chops, sounding like a cross of yngwie malmsteens classical style and tony macalpines wild neck sweeps, and keyboard duels. the songs are all pretty good too. my fav songs second sight, the inner road, the rhapsody sounding  in nomine, the stringless violin. the first four tacks are really good. lands of sin which runs a little over 11 minutes has a awsome guitar solo half way through.  <br />awsome band  guitars drums singer everything sounds awsome.

B0001I562I|5.0|Flight of the Navigator certainly brings back wonderful memories, of childhood in the summertime eating hotdogs and drinking soda on a sunday night. This Disney flick about a boy's journey mysterious journey through time was long overdue on DVD!! Ofcourse we cannot forget that Sarah Jessica Parker has a prominent role! And isn't Paul Reubens, (aka Pee Wee Herman) the voice of the alien navigator??<br />The Picture and Sound quality are excellent, as compared to that old VHS copy we all have! Presented in 1:85:1 Aspect Ratio Widescreen. The DVD is lacking any real special features, like &quot;The Making of&quot; or &quot;Commentaries&quot; but it is a wonderful addition to that nostalgic childhood collection.
0780622650|4.0|since hollywood insists on remaking my childhood favorites im glad that i got lucky and somebody helped make this one pretty good. a lot of remakes trash the original idea and thus suck big time! this newer lost in space isn't bad at all. it is definitely something that you can watch with your kids. it's an update sure, but your kids will probably love this and it's true to the spirit of the old show. it's a kid's adventure through space with the robinsons. gotta love it!
0739309013|5.0|Thank you Mr. Grisham for returning to the story lines that I fell in love with from your pen after THE FIRM.  This story was especially interesting to me...because the main character, the 25 year old buys the local newspaper...which was in trouble. You used this character to weave a small town story that kept me laughing, smiling and sometimes mad me angry! (that's what small towns will do for you! :-)  <br />Well I am the owner of a publication and found ALL of what you wrote concerning subscriptions and readership quite interesting, to say the least &amp; 100% TRUE.  You really did an excellent job of character development...even to the siblings who were landlords.  I don't like leaving reviews which tell TOO much of the story because that discourages (in a lot of cases) others from buying/reading the book....so I will simply say this....for anyone who takes the time to read your reviews of this book...this is a definite Grisham must read.  You won't be disappointed.<br />I loved the story from cover to cover and await your next literary work!<br />Thanks for going back to Mississippi.<br />Shunda Leigh<BR>Booking Matters Magazine<BR>[...]
B0000AZJXQ|4.0|Well, if you're lookin' for another &quot;Mer De Noms&quot;, its not gonna happen, but, musically this album is very pleasing to the ear.  The abilty to produce good and wholesome(talented) music has not gone.   Althought the album is not as heavy as the first release, it is a definite buy.  IMHO, this is great buy for music fans, it will please the ear as well as entertain.  Enjoy.
B00005OAIE|5.0|Room for Squares is just brilliant for everyone. It is easy to listen to, sing, along to and relate with.<br />Every song has a different edge to it and while some critics may feel he is a little self-indulgent it makes a refreshing change to the f-ing and blinding &quot;sung&quot; by rappers and nu-metal bands.<br />John Mayer is a wonderful songwriter and conveys it all with brilliant tunes and a relaxing voice, almost like he is singing it to you over lunch. It is a different mix, but one that works so well.<br />If there was only one CD I could take onto a desert island, this would be it.
1592400876|4.0|If you've ever been severely irritated by the blatant grammatical errors on sign and billboards, in magazines and even on television, you'll love this book.  It's good to know I'm not the only one.  The examples of bad grammar will make you laugh out loud.  If you agree that internet communications are making horrendous grammar even more acceptable, this book is definitely for you.<br />I was almost too intimidated to write this review, since everyone reading it will be scrutinizing my grammar!
1400031362|5.0|It is really a great series! The changes in this book makes it fresh and gives it a new twist. Not only does she have an assistant who proves to be as wise and intelligent, but Mma's new approach to solving problems and understanding people's behavior is the main issue in this book. It shifts a little from the route of culture, and emphasizes on everyday issues just like in any other place. We don't see Mma explaining traditions and their meaning, but trying to understand human nature, whether it was depression or revenge, she finds a way to show reality and truth, even her assistant found her own way of facing truth.<br />I can't wait to find out what is going to happen to Mr. Matekoni, and what happened to the ring?!!
B00008S2VG|1.0|While most &quot;real artists&quot; thrive much better when going it alone--without a 'busload' of writers, engineers, and mixers, Madonna suffers greatly, as is very evident on this latest fiasco from this ever so grossly Overrated manufactured pop maven. The singing- if you can call it that, is embarrassingly weak, the lyrics- with the lions share going to Madonna this time around is grade school level at best, and the outdated electronica over powers most of her vocals, which I guess is a good thing. Sad thing is Madonna hasn't moved beyond her 80's pop music label. It's just the diehards who are in complete denial of this sadly mediocre, dare I say singer...
B00006L83N|5.0|This album is amazing veary complex, and just sounds awsome. Unlike the last album, V, Symphony's new album starts off right in your face woth ana mazing gutar solo, that turns into one of the heavest songs on the album. The next song doesn't sound hard but it is, my band tried playing wicked and it fell apart beause it's so hard to keep together. The next song is my favorit song on the album, it's veary great playing. The next song shows the keyboard player shin at the begging, then gets heavey. King Of Terrer may be the heavest song on the album. The nest song is preaty heavey as well. then they slow it down a bit. The Odessey is in many people's minds( including my own ) on of the bands masterpeaces, it's one of the best epic's ever written. Mascarade has a veary hard guitar solo at the begging, a veary well written song.  <br />Overall the album is briluant, a must have, a classic, and anyother good tittle out there, veary well writen, and veary complex.
B00008S2VG|1.0|Madonna should forget about doing it alone! She's not a music genius, she'd better get Patrick Leonard's help once again. Perhaps she'll make it back as a disco bimbo!<br />Avoid this piece of trash at all costs.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|Whoever hasn't seen this cult hit of a movie must see it.<br />Jake Gyllenhaal plays Donnie Darko, a young man who has emotional problems and starts to see a giant rabbit who tells him that the world is going to end.  It sounds like a stupid premise, but don't let that fool you.  The film is very creepy with it's music score and sound.  An all-star cast supports this film, which include: Drew Barrymore as a teacher at the school; Jena Malone as Donnie's girlfriend; Noah Wyle as another teacher and Drew's boyfriend; Patrick Swayze as a mentor who teaches kids about fear.<br />The film is heading back to theaters because of a very big request for it.  About 20 mins. of additional footage is being added into the film also.  If it hits a theater near you, check it out.  It's great.
B0001Z53AQ|2.0|Definately one of the biggest disappointments of the year.  D12 came into the scene strong in 2001 releasing their debut album, &quot;Devil's Night&quot; a strong, uptempo, hearty CD from start to finish with good lyrics.  Expecting a strong come back with D12 World, The popular singles, &quot;How Come&quot; and &quot;My Band&quot; came out showing some good examples of what was to come of the CD.  &quot;My Band&quot; got old in about 3 days thanks to over playing it on MTV and TRL and the only good part that i found in &quot;How Come&quot; was the chorus, everything to expect from the genius in Eminem.  Don't buy the CD, wait for Eminem's new CD to drop and buy that or get something new coming out this summer.  Lots of better stuff out there coming out now then D12 World, don't waste your money and time listening to it.
B0001MDP3G|2.0|In \\"Cold Mountain,\\" director Anthony Minghella wants us to believe in the love between Inman (Jude Law) and Ada (Nicole Kidman) but has nothing to prove it. For the most part of the movie they are kept distant and communicating only through letters, mostly from Ada, as she voiceovers her sappy messages that suggests that she has read her poetry but has yet to master its significance and proper usage. Their relationship begins awkwardly and unconvincingly, sharing no insight into the background of both Inman and Ada, and we do not understand nor are we hinted at about their desire for one another. Except for one piece of excerpt that seems to be written because it has not been written before, as Inman prepares to leave for the Civil War and suggests Ada to leave Cold Mountain and she something in the vicinity of, \\"Then there won't be anyone waiting for you.\\"<br />Kidman and Law are less than adequate in this film. Law, who got an underserved Academy nomination, contains little emotion and energy and misplaced. Kidman plays Ada a little more passionately but even she seems more like a mere imitation. Both Law and Kidman seem more affixed with getting their southern accent done properly, and not even that do they triumph at. Rene Zellwegger, who won the Oscar for Ruby, is actually the only flare to this film. She is funny, loud, and crude and certainly a good addition to balance out the blandness of Kidman and Law. Yet, her Oscar is underserved because Ruby is too one-dimensional and seems more like a caricature trying to jumpstart a boring party. <br />In the commercial for \\"Cold Mountain,\\" one critic said it's the \\"best Civil War movie of all times.\\" I can refute it in so many ways but the main argument is that the Cold War is a minor detail in this movie. Throughout the film, Minghella only suggests the importance of the love between these two protagonists and offers no statement about the war. Once in a while the war is being questioned but there are many things that are not attentively mentioned such as issues of slavery. \\"Cold Mountain\\" is fashionably dressed by Minghella's artistry, which I admire, but the lack of sentimentality makes this a disappointing Civil War film.
B0001UL7RY|3.0|I really like Avril but, honestly, \\"Don't Tell Me\\" is by far the best song on this CD. The other songs are not in the same league. My advice is to buy the single of \\"Don't Tell Me\\" (itunes, napster, walmart, etc.) and enjoy yourself knowing that you have by far the best song in this collection and that you saved lots of money. Enjoy!
B0001WTUH6|1.0|If you're like me, you are really - really - getting tired of producers, film compaines, whomever there is to blame re-re-re-releasing the same DVD with different packaging, and calling it the &quot;Ultimate&quot; or &quot;Supreme&quot; or &quot;this time it really is a Limted edition&quot; special releases. The motivation? Raking it in from fans who expect and want more. You'd be better off spending your bucks elsewhere.<br />There is NOTHING to make this DVD stand out from the original release. I was looking for extended fight scenes. Nope.  OK, how about more history or plot? Nope.  The extra footage really should have stayed on the cutting room floor.  You WILL not be happy if you already own the original release and waste your money on this lame release.
0743201140|4.0|An integral part of this book is the online profile.  Each copy of this book comes with a unique PIN number inside the book jacket.  If you buy a used copy, the PIN number may be already used, and thus will not allow you to use the online profile.  However, the book is still interesting if you enjoy reading through the signature themes and guessing what your profile would have uncovered.  It is also fun to read each theme and think of people you know who come to mind, and consider ways in which you can support their strengths.<br />I would give this book 5 stars if an unlimited number of people could use the online profile with each book purchase.

1592400876|5.0|When I first saw this book advertised, I coudn't imagine what it was about. What kind of title is that?  Then I read the description and it made perfect sense.  So much for the laws of a short, descriptive title that tells you exactly what the book is about.  Perhaps a few agents and publishers will learn something from this.  At any rate, I fully recommend &quot;Eats, Shoots &amp; Leaves: The Zero Tolerance Approach to Punctuation&quot; by Lynne Truss. It will not replace your AP, Chicago, MLA or APA stylebooks, but it will add to your enjoyment of their much-needed use. This book is funny, informative, and above all, a must for anyone interested in the betterment of mankind.
B00005JMJG|4.0|Eternal sunshine is a clever movie that explores the concept of memory being erased to remove unpleasant memories.  The setting is a dreary, blighted area of Long Island NY and the beaches of Montauk, where the disrupted romance of the Jim Carrey & Kate Winslet characters begins.  The story shifts back and forth in time as well as in and out of the mind of the Carrey character.  The supporting cast includes Elijah Wood and Kirsten Dunst, with each supporting character playing an important role in the progression of the plot.  The story can be confusing at times during the film, and overall the movie leaves a bittersweet emotional aftertaste.  There are a couple interesting philosophical quotes presented by the Dunst character, and the very nature and setting of the film are rather curious in light of documented stories and rumors about mind control/manipulation experiments and projects carried out by government/occult groups using a military facility at Montauk.  The wintery scenes and changes in Winslet's hair color in the course of the film are quite metaphoric of what is happening within the consciousness of the lead character, and can also be used to help track the temporal sequence of the film.  This film is quite intriguing, though it has a somewhat ambivalent ending that won't satisfy those seeking story closure or a \\"feel good\\" conclusion.  Carrey's role is quite serious, although he gets to show some of his childish side in sequences where he goes back into his mind and tries to modify his own memories to hide his consciousness of his girlfriend from the memory erasing apparatus.  This movie is philosophical and suspenseful, too sophisticated to be a blockbuster but a real treat for those who enjoy an artful original story.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|A REVIEW BY WANDRWOMAN:<br />Let me start by saying that I am totally obsessed with this album. I bought the DVD after being blown away by the CD. True, I am a Baby Boomer. True, I grew up with the Beatles and Eric Clapton. But, for me, that was a very long time ago in so many ways. I am not \\"A Fan\\". I am a normal woman who likes music but would certainly never take the time to rate it here on Amazon. The point is, I can't remember the last time I listened to a recording that literally made the hair stand up on the back of my neck! This is amazing Rock and Roll and I defy anyone who claims to be unmoved by the magnitude of this music and the musicians who wrote and performed it. I have a new, deep appreciation for the performing artists that Paul McCartny, Ringo Star (yes, even Ringo!) and Jeff Lynn have become; the enduring relevance of the music of George Harrison, the composer; and the deep abiding faith that Eric Clapton is indeed GOD. Especially wonderful are \\"Something\\" and \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" by Paul McCartney and Eric Clapton, \\"My Sweet Lord\\" by Billy Preston, and \\"Horse to Water\\" by Jools Holland and Sam Brown which, for some reason is not on the CD. This is a great, historic concert by giants of Rock and Roll. Buy it. You won't be sorry.
B00006RU5B|1.0|Rage Against the Machine and Sound Garden were both awesome bands apart from one another, they had completely different styles and sounds and thats how it should have been, after the demise of these 2 bands when I heard about Audioslave I was all for it, it would be like the coming of 2 amazing bands molded into 1, but alas it wasn't to be. After hearing the minor hit Cocheise I lost some of my faith for the band but I still had hope that it was first single jitters...then I heard like a stone. This song sucked abysmally, it pissed me off more then anything, it lead me to champion for the return of rage and garden, because this song was nothing of what these bands used to be, long drawn out moody songs COMING FROM FORMER RAGE PLAYERS?! THIS IS WRONG!!  And with that song it signaled my now hatred of Audioslave, personnally if Sound Garden doesn't get back togeather oh well thats a shame, but if Rage doesn't get back togeather then its a crime because they are needed, because now more then ever political bands are need to help sway the mind of a country needing a regime change.
0156027321|5.0|If you are one of the ten people in the world who have not read this--there were eleven, but I gave in and just read it--then by all means hit the one-click and read this.<br />This is a fabulous--literally, fabulous--story.  Tons of adventure.  It's a saga for those who dislike sagas.<br />And there is some religion in it.  But the protagonist says that &quot;this is a story that will make you believe in God,&quot; and that didn't work, at least, not for me.  The book made me believe in Tigers.  It made me believe in the power of the main character.  It made me believe in the skills of the author.  But God?
B000000W5L|5.0|If you've gotten this far, it probably safe to say that you know by now that EVERYONE seems to think it is their best ever, of all time, on the desert island, scrounging for gas money because you bought it once more album. And it surely has a pretty good legend surrounding it (south of france, stoned, ripped, twisted..good people). But is it their Best? That all depends.<BR>   Me? I like \\"Sticky Fingers\\" a little better for one reason: The good songs (Brown Sugar, Can't You Hear me Knockin', Bitch, Sister Morphine) are Transcendant, whereas here the good songs (Tumbling Dice, Shine a Light)Are only \\"Damned Good\\". Yes, it's a very fine line, to be sure, but it must be said. And \\"Fingers\\" Wins hands down on opening tracks-I mean \\"Brown Sugar\\" vs. \\"Rocks Off\\"? There's no comparison. Fun Fact: Keith Richards once listed \\"Brown Sugar\\" as one of his favorite all-time songs with this justification \\"Don't YOU think it's a great song?\\"<BR>That being said, however, \\"Exile\\" is the stronger album of the two. The reason? The rest of songs here are neither as bad or as ordinary as the rest of the songs on any other Stones album. Let me put it this way: It's said that any good song will have a sort of \\"magic\\" about it. Well, here most every song has that kind of magic in varying amounts. Put on any single song (with the exception of \\"Turd on the Run\\", which just doesn't have the magic) and you will end up liking that song on its own merits. It may not be a religious experience, but you will want to hear that song again. It's that kind of album. The same cannot be said for any other Stones Album in their catalogue, and all but the precious few other jewels in the rest of the history of Pop Music.<BR>   Of Course, as with all High-water marks, The Stones were destined to fight against the reputation of this masterwork for the rest of their careers, and always be found just a little lacking. A shame, really, for what remains one of the Great Bands Ever and a consistent hit-making force even now, 30+ years on.
055357342X|3.0|This is the only GOOD book in George's series.  I'm saying this because it's in the fantasy category, and it has barely anything that a true fantasy has.  It has little romance, much for lies and greed, and the good guys mostly end up dead.  It's too true to real life, and should be more considered some sort of fabricated history than a true fantasy.  I've seen so many good reviews of the series that I felt I REALLY needed to say something BAD about it.  As an avid fantasy reader and lover of historical fiction, I'd have to say that George is very good about hooking you into the books, but he's even better at letting you down.  If you read the books, when your favorite &quot;good guy&quot; is slain, (and most of them are slain, don't you worry!) you'll feel the burn.  This book is tolerable and actually interesting, which draws you into the rest of the series.  If you don't have a lot of time for disappointment and cruelty, though, I would not bother with this series.  Go read the master, Tolkien.  (In all truth, Tolkien was a bit slow on the writing and good at descriptions, which came to bore me after a time.. but he is MUCH BETTER than this haphazard attempt at fantasy.)
B000002HPT|2.0|Aside from two great songs, those being New Millenium and Lines in the Sand (Doug Pinnick is The Man), this album sounds like the band's attempt at a more &quot;Commercial DT&quot; (???) I mean the influx of 3rd party &quot;hitmaker&quot; songwriters and just the overall lameness of this album make it one to pass on. Big DT fans (Despite what you may be thinking, I DO consider myself one) will want it for the two numbers mentioned above (which makes it ALMOST worth the price of the CD).
0553579908|1.0|This book took me an entire 3 months to read, just because it was so boring.  War, war, death, burning, war, and more war, sums up this book.  If you want to read this series.. I suggest skipping this book altogether, unless you enjoy extremely long accounts of war, more war, pain, mayhem, and endless, utterly long sequences of death.  The other two books in the series so far are alright, but this book is worth skipping entirely.  The whole book drags badly, and I had a hard time finishing it because I honestly disliked it so much, and so little was happening except for the above.  George needs to learn how to seperate a fantasy from a made-up historical novel, with all the treacheries and evils and pain of true war.. and that's what this book reads like.  NOT a pretty tale at all.
B0000399WI|5.0|I don't understand why critics and some moviegoers stated that this movie was too long for it's own good. I can't think of one scene that should have been shortened or taken out. This movie will suck you in and KEEP you sucked into it's grasp until the very ending, which might I add, is the best ending I have ever seen in my entire movie watching career. This movie is emotionally packed with all kinds of goods. Don't miss this one.
B00007L4MJ|5.0|Of all silent films, maybe the only one still watched by a wide public today is Metropolis. Everyone who knows about science fiction knows about Metropolis.<br />Unfortunately the film was birth-strangled - like Once Upon a Time in America and The Magnificent Ambersons - and it falls into the strange pantheon of movies that are as fragmentary as any ancient scroll.<br />This only added to the appeal, of course. Like the wine buff who sighs to drink one of THE French vintages from before 1860, cineastes have spculated and respeculated about this fragmentary masterpiece. Why doesn't the story make sense? What was the movie originally like - and can it be fixed?<br />It is a pity that this film will almost certainly NEVER be completely restored. Like The Magnificent Ambersons, this is a masterpiece that seems permanently damaged. But in 2002, the next best thing was done; and the most complete possible restoration was carried out.<br />The results are truly remarkable. You can see that silent films were NOT originally shown in a spotty, scratchy condition with hyperactive actors. When they first came out, silent movies looked just as good as any modern movie (well, maybe less screen-resolution). The original soundtrack was discovered and recorded - and it, too, is a revelation. Silent movies were NOT actually silent - they had live soundtracks (though only rich premieres had full orchestras). The soundtrack is as well-composed as any modern soundtrack. I initially thought I would not be able to get used to another soundtrack after hearing the Moroder version - but now I think I can't see the film any other way.<br />Most importantly, the film now actually makes sense! Every scrap of film possible was extracted from archives all over the world, to make the film as complete as is humanly possible. The scenes still missing (alas, comprising a quarter of the film even now) are signified by intertitles telling the audience what they ought to be seeing. This is not a perfectcompromise, but it's probably the best solution.<br />Silent movies often look strangely modern, since they concentrate almost entirely on visuals at the expense of the actors (a feature that, incidentally, made movies easier to show overseas than any modern movie). Compare that to our movies, which are very heavy on visuals and contain the simplest and least amount of dialogue possible in order to cater to foreign markets. Also, the complete manipulation of the image, so favoured in Metropolis, is very much like modern computer graphics.
0312335164|1.0|It's hard to know where to start with this book.  Idealistically, I expect an author who chooses a technical subject to provide at least some factual basis.  You won't find a shred in here.  Nothing  in this book about digital cryptography, viruses, computer security or programming has any resemblance to fact, and if you read it hoping to learn something in the process about digital cryptography, forget it.  In fact, if you were hoping to learn anything about basic mathematics, you might as well forget that too (although I did manage to find one almost true statement; if computer A can do a task in 19 years, and computer B is nearly a million times as fast, computer B would take about 12 minutes to do the task. Disregarding the fact that 3 &quot;stamp-sized&quot; computers would be the equivalent of NSA's fastest supercomputer, of course).<br />So let's skip the technology.  Logically, nothing in this book makes sense either.  Auction off the &quot;Pass-key(?)&quot; for 20 million dollars?  What's the buyer going to do with it?  He has the key, he has the encrypted material, but DOOH, he's still missing a vital component.  And the NSA's plan for what they want to do with it?  Gee, I hope they have a time-machine in their back pocket.<br />Ok, let's forget about logic.  How about the spycraft? Laughable to non-existent.  I hope that everything he says about the NSA is as accurate as everything he says about encryption.  If there's even a grain of realism there, I wouldn't trust the NSA with my daughter's locker combination.<br />Characters?  Each page of the paperback edition has more depth than any of his characters.  Plot?  Plot?  Anybody seen the plot? It does have a lot of action, but then, so does my clothes dryer.  Lots of action, but it doesn't really go anywhere you care about.<br />About the only thing you can do with this book is use it as a test of your logic ability.  Find the holes in each and every argument or scenario. Fortunately, Brown provides enough detail to hang himself at every turn, so the ridiculousness of each statement he makes is provable.<br />Totally worthless as fact or fiction, but you can have some fun with it if you're logically-minded.
B0002B15XI|3.0|Normaly I would give this movie a 5 stars. I mean it is that good. The movie is outstanding. <br />Here is the reason I am giving this only 3 stars: <br />I am puzzled of why 20th Century Fox is re-releasing this movie as a single disc DVD.<br />They should have released the single disc first, then the Five Star Collection edition.<br />Hey 20th Century Fox, why????????
B00005RHGK|4.0|THIS ONE HAS THE CREEPIEST OPENING FOR A MOVIE THAT IVE SEEN IN A WHILE. PRETTY GOOD UNTIL THE LAST 20 MINUTES OR SO. WORTH WATCHIND ONCE OR TWICE. HORRO BUFFS WILL LOVE IT.

B00005JLKN|2.0|Then, Red Dragon is Ok, worth seeing. But, DO NOT MISS &quot;MANHUNTER&quot;!<BR>Aside from some 80's stylings, most notably the closing music over the credits, while still fitting, dates Manhunter, however, appropriately.<BR>Red Dragon is only compelling in that you &quot;Get More&quot;, of the book.<BR>The ending is truer.<BR>The acting, and directing is clumsy.<BR>It's difficult to watch Ed Norton fumble through Will Graham's wondeful legacy of Peterson's portrayol in &quot;Manhunter&quot;.<BR>Worse still, is watching Anthony Hopkins spew the same lines as Brian Cox, as the &quot;Original&quot; Hannibal Lechtor. Hideous.<BR>Oh, Tony adds his own &quot;Lechtorism's, but, this film is a money grab.<BR>It's odd too, because Dino owns &quot;Manhunter&quot;!!<BR>So, this movie is ONLY a Remake!<BR>When you watch &quot;Manhunter&quot;, you will see where Clarissa got her lines.....<BR>&quot;Silence&quot;, is the direct descendant of &quot;Manhunter&quot;.<BR>And, with Hannibal (the movie, not the book), being left unfinished, there will more than likely be another money grab, hopefully, however, from a book as brilliantly written as the first three.<BR>Make no mistake, Red Dragon exists, simply to &quot;fill a gap&quot; in time, where something can be sold to those of us, who want more &quot;Lechtor&quot;.<BR>Manhunter is by far, the superior Movie.<BR>The film's color, and score, all add to the tension, that was only since recaptured in &quot;Silence&quot;.<BR>In years to come, Manhunter will stand as the far more mature movie, as it draws on more time honored cinematic core values. <br />Red Dragon is difficult to watch also, with Lechtor's and Chilton's charachters, hopelessly &quot;Made up&quot; to look as if they're 20 some years younger than (the actors) actually are! It looks silly.<BR>Yes, in the original movie, they were afraid &quot;Red Dragon&quot; would denote a karate film. &quot;Manhunter&quot; is derived from the fact that Will Graham, is Hunting the newserial killer, Frances Dolarhyde.<BR>Bottom Line: I wouldn't advise you miss this movie, if you like the series. But, certainly don't choose this over the real original: &quot;Manhunter&quot;. See them both, if you must.....<BR>Dream much, Will?<br />Pete
B00002E233|5.0|THIS IS SUCH A GOOD MOVIE. I LOVE IT. ITS MY 5TH FAV. MOVIE. ITS GREAT. THE SHARKS LOOK SO COOL AND IT MAKES U HAVE THAT OLD FAMILOR FEELING. ITS NOT SAVE TO GO BACK IN THE WATER.
B0000B3FCX|5.0|First of all, I am absolutely disgusted by the wording of many of the people reviewing this album... and all over Amazon, actually.  Seriously, if you're going to trash something, at least spell the words right.  I know that you can get by in the modern world with no knowledge of how to spell or write, but it's still nice to see sometimes.<br />Secondly, reviews are opinions.  If that is something that escapes you, then you should probably take a class on social concepts or communication skills.  Soon.  Saying things like, &quot;If you buy this album you are a pathetic waste of space&quot; really doesn't contribute anything.  Obviously YOU don't like the album, but that's the miracle of the internet, you can express YOUR ideas freely.  Calling hundreds of thousands of people a waste of space because they buy a CD is not acceptable.<br />Finally, on to the album.<br />I've been a fan of Nickelback since I saw them in concert with Creed and they were GREAT!  They had an amazing live performance, and only having heard two of their songs previously, I was pleasantly surprised to find that I liked a lot of other songs as well.  This new CD is great.<br />Last comment.  People complain incessantly about bands &quot;selling out&quot; by changing their sound, and they also complain about bands having the same sound from CD to CD.  Give them a f***ing break, people.
B00005OM4N|5.0|\\"Britney,\\" Brit's junior album is just what my title implies, Britney's Best Cd ever. The tracks are fun energetic, dance-worthy and definetly songs to get stuck in you head, forcing you to sing them all day.<br />I'm A Slave 4 U- The perfect song to start off the cd, and an awesome predecesscor to the other U.S released tracks. Rating- 10/10<br />Overprotected- Another great Britney hit. The song is very independent and makes you want to forge your own independence listning to it. Good, but the darckchild remix was definetly better. Rating-9/10<br />Lonely- One of my abslolute favorite Britney Spears songs. Funky, attitudistic, and groovy all define this song. (I don't mean the \\"Austin Powers\\" groovy, but it has a very good groove.) Rating-10/10<br />I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman- A beautiful meaningful song that you can listen to maybe 3 times a week because you can easily get sick of this song. Rating-7/10<br />Boys- A funky Neptunes produced song that will definetly make you dance. Sexy lyrics, but can sometimes be contradicting. First she's talking about going home with the guy, then in later bridges talks about them not seeing one another again so t make the best of the night, sort of seeking a love connection. All in all song rocked! Rating-8/10<br />Anticipating- Yet another disappointng Baby One More Time sounding song that takes away from the budding maturity of the album. Song is pretty corny and childish. Rating-4/10<br />I Love Rock N Roll- An awesome remake of the song that featured some of her borderline Shania Twain sounding crooning. Song you'll have to get up and dance to no matter your mood. Rating-9/10<br />Cinderella- Three words- Absolutely-Hated-It. This song should have been burned. She should be embarrassed for putting this o her cd. Rating-0/10<br />Let Me Be- My favorite song on the album. Has a catchy half pop/half-hip hop sound to it with the rhythms and beats. Rating-10/10<br />Bombastic Love- Another one of my favorites. Has semi poor lyrics, but the beat is great and is very singable. I love this song to pieces. Rating-10/10<br />That's Where You Take Me- The beginning of the song is sooooo great. Once you get to the chorus, you immediatly want to turn it off. All in all very pretty song.Rating-9/10<br />What It's Like To Be Me- This is my theme song. It carefully examines the dating situation of today and offers a response that every girl should give. \\" Take the time to realize I'm not the kind to sacrifice the way I am,\\" are some of the lyrics that make this song the best one Britney has ever, ever ever, ever, ever, ever, ever made. Rating-20!/10<br />This is Brit's best. No way to deny it!
1577311523|5.0|I started reading some of the reviews of this book, both negative and positive and got worn out.  We can go on and on putting forth our opinions about the writer,the way it was written, it is too simplistic etc. etc. What I know is this. The proof of its power is in its ability to create positive change in the life of the reader.  For me it was a difficult book to read and understand. I've read it many times in the last year and I still find new things to think about in it.  This is a book whose ideas are meant to be lived and I've dedicated myself to trying to live it.  Because of it my mental life has turned around. If it can do this for me and for some of the people that read it, then it has accomplished it's purpose.  Those people who are looking for more will continue looking. I don't agree with each and every word of this book.  Nevertheless, I think it is a good introduction to understanding the concept of mental stillness which was a concept completely new to me when I first picked it up. I've since read other books in this vein but continue to come back to it.  For those who haven't read it, you have nothing but a little time and money to lose.
B0000W3YIS|5.0|I was disappointed reading other people's reviews of this album. I was most angered by the disregard of tracks 7, and 8. First off, I think \\"Outrageous\\" is one of Brit's best songs, on the cd, and collected with the other 3 previous disc. Secondly I was most angered by the hate of \\"Touch Of My Hand.\\" Touch Of My Hand has absolutely nothing to do with sex or masturbation! The song is about a girl learning more about herself and having some me time\\" because she doesn't have a boyfriend. I can relate, and every other girl in the world can relate. I also don't like the constant comparison between her and Kylie Minogue. Kylie Minogue, in my opinion, is a talentless one-hit-wonder that received way too much acclaim for that childish \\"C'est La Vie\\" sounding song \\"Can't get you out of my head.\\" This is not britney's best cd as a whole, but holds a lot of her best songs. I also thought \\"The Answer\\" was a very different song, but good nonetheless. Also, \\"The Hook Up\\" was DEFINETLY NOT A FILLER SONG, BUT ONE OF HER BEST OF ALL TIME!!!!<br />Me Against The Music- 4/5<BR>I Got That Boom Boom-5/5<BR>Showdown-5/5<BR>Breathe On Me-3/5<BR>Early Mornin- 1/5<BR>Toxic-5/5<BR>Outrageous-5/5<BR>Touch Of My Hand-5/5<BR>The Hook Up-5/5<BR>Shadow-3/5<BR>Brave New Girl-0/5<BR>Everytime-5/5<BR>Remix-0/5<BR>The Answer-4/5<BR>Don't Hang Up-2/5
6305128952|1.0|First off, I'm an avid reader.  I read this book shortly before I heard about the movie coming out and I loved it.  I couldn't put it down &amp; cried through the last chapter.  Now, to clarify...I'm not one of those weepy women who cries over hallmark comercials &amp; other such drivel.  It takes a lot to make me shed a tear.  That said, I got so into the book that I couldn't help feel the pain the characters were going through.  <br />When the movie came out, I went to the theatre to watch it...excited about seeing it all come to life before me.  I know better than this b/c rarely are movies as good as the books, but still I hoped for the best.  It was beautiful.  I'll give it that...but it was slow.  I felt every mile of the drive from NY to Montana.  Besides being bored through most of the movie, I got more &amp; more angry as I realized just how little respect was paid to the book with the screenplay.  The characters weren't the ones that I had fallen in love with...or in the same respect hated.  They were just kinda emotionless, middle of the road representations of the characters that Nicholas Evans created.  Then...somewhere along the line, I'm guessing the screenplay writer decided that the book that they had bought the rights to wasn't good enough so they took the liberty to omit the last 4th of the book &amp; reinvent their own Hollywoodized ending.  As a reader and a Nicholas Evans fan, I couldn't help but feel that they butchered his work.  <br />BUT, if you like long, slow, movies and have never read &amp; don't intend to read the book...go right ahead and see this movie.  You just might like it.   Scarlett Johanssen is good and the scenery is beautiful.

B0001HLVSC|4.0|I'll save you the trouble of reading what has already been written on why this is a very fine movie, and will only add that if you are looking for a pure and simple action movie, you might want to stick to The Fast and the Furious or Speed.  I've read reviews from people who obviously have VERY short attention spans and for some reason found any part of the movie where canons were not being fired to be &quot;boring.&quot;  If this sounds like you, you might not be able to appreciate this one.<br />I just wanted to say that any big fan of the movie, and especially fans of the books, should skip this version of the DVD.  It contains nothing but the film, no special features or commentaries, and you would be much better off going for the two disk special edition.
B0002234LS|4.0|Johnny Depp has so many mannerisms, tics, quirks, glances, and body language tweaks that it would be difficult to catalogue even half of them. Of course Pirates of the Caribbean gave him ample stage room to run through his entire repertoire, so, by comparison, Secret Window comes up a bit short. They're entirely different genres, Pirates being high camp/adventure and Window being creepy horror, but still, there's room for comparison.<BR>Depp, excellently cast against the equally well-cast John Turturro, plays a depressed, recently divorced writer who is surprised one day to be approached in his remote lakeside cabin by a distinctly threatening dude with a hillbilly accent and, tho you don't see it, it's clear the guy maybe used to be an axe murderer. He accuses Depp of plagiarism. As this all began with a Stephen King tale, you know where it's heading: into the realm of other-worldly horror stuff.<BR>Not Depp's best work, although given what he had to work with, he does a helluva good job of it. And it's well worth watching if only to catch, as you sense he's going bonkers, his increasingly frequent tics that involve mouth and jaw stretching - and biting.
B00005JMEW|5.0|According to Tarantino, Uma is his \\"muse\\". Whether or not that's true, I've come to the conclusion that the two make a remarkably resourceful team. Anyone who was entranced by Therman's unstoppable performance in the gritty Pulp Fiction will be equally amazed at the job she does in Kill Bill. <BR>    Once again, Tarantino pulls out all the stops and makes a film that hasn't one iota of modesty. Therman (The Bride) is beaten, shot in the head and left for dead while pregnant, and later becomes the target of two rednecks looking for action anywhere they can--even from unconscious hospital patients. But that is not to say that The Bride takes her misfortune lying down. The movie itself is a wonderful chronicle of her bloody, no-holds-barred revenge, a revenge which extends to anyone and everyone who gets in her way. <BR>       Her revenge is played to the tune of the good old days of film-making, with definite references to shoot-em-up westerns and sword-slinging asian kung-fu films. Those references being what they are, you have to take the unbelievable amount of blood and violence in this movie with a grain of salt. There's a reason that when a character's head is cut off, his neck becomes an almost laughable fountain of blood. Every bloody sequence is well-orchestrated and obviously planned piece by piece. If this movie had had ultra-realistic violence and an atmosphere that did not feel like an redone classic, this film would be worthless. <BR>     The film itself is a testament to how wonderful a director Tarantino is. No one could have pulled off a revenge movie this straight forward and received the box office acclaim that Quentin did. When I had first seen ads for this film, I was disheartened. I assumed it would be a bad flick that was just playing the name card with Tarantino, without living up to the prestige and magnificance of Pulp Fiction and Resevoir Dogs. I couldn't have been more wrong. Everything comes together in this film. The soundtrack plays likesomething from a Spaghetti Western with modern flare and a sexy edge, and it fits the story nicely. I absolutely loved the music transgression in the opening sequence of pulp fiction and this film definitely rivals it. <BR>   Along with the soundtrack, there is a wonderful amount of Tarantino flare. My only complaint here is that with that flare, the movie follows the same path that pulp fiction did: all the scenes are mixed up, and there are chapters. It's been done. However, it's been done very well once again. In addition, Tarantino finds various hooks from a seemingly endless bag of tricks that he apparently can still work from. An enormous fight scene involving the bride versus a veritable army is excellently choreographed and fun to watch. Also, there is a long anime segment halfway through the movie. I really don't care much for anime, as I know most people don't, but it fit fairly well into the story. I do have a complaint about that segment and that is that it was very very long and fairly overdone. You get the feeling that it was an excuse to show an exorbitant amount of blood and that they held onto that for too long. However, you must once again take the violence with a grain of salt. <BR>     In any case, Kill Bill should not be missed if you understand what Tarantino was trying to do here and you appreciate a good, well-written movie that doesn't care about being pretty. If you don't like blood and rediculously vile sex references, don't think about seeing this movie. if you're open minded and want to be taken on a good ride, you should check it out
B0001NBMBC|3.0|This album was another below par attempt to cash in on the great mushroomhead phenom. Maybe if slipknot would try to produce something original instead of just ripping off another bands ideas;They might be good enough to make it through a whole set without getting heckled off stage with a hail of C batteries flying at their heads.
B00008OWZC|5.0|This is Led Zeppelin's Long Beach/LA performences at describes Jimmy Page their peek of their career doing their best. You hear a variety of songs that everyone just loves. I like hearing Dancing Days, and The Ocean live as well as the twenty minute Dazed And Confused. This is the best live recording out their. This has been bootlegged for so many years being a crappy recording until this three disc set came out this crappy recording turned out to be a masterpiece. This is the best live recording Led Zeppelin had...... worth 100 stars.
B0000AKCLS|5.0|A wonderful collection of cover songs with an original thrown in.  Everything from hard driving bar room blues to ballad and delta blues sounds.  It took me a few songs to realize he's not one of those that throws the whole bag of tricks at you in the first minute and is out of gas by the fourth song.  Very tastefull playing that can go from in your face to mellow and sound great.  Fans of Walter Trout, SRV, Buddy Guy, Roy Buchanan and guitar blues/blues rock will find something to catch their ear on this CD.  One of the newer guns like Johnny Lang and Kenny Wayne Shepard but with a heavier sound.  Never heard his other releases.  This one will find alot of time in my playlist.  Mainly a cover sing CD that benifits from classic songs performed by a great musician.  I hope Blues Deluxe 2 happens sometime soon.
B000002JEV|4.0|Led Zeppelin where one of the greatest live rock n roll bands in the history of rock n roll. When they played the BBC they where very young all seeking to write songs. On the CD their are alot of blues jams in the process. Their are the same old songs as well as Communication Breakdown, and Dazed And Confused. I think this CD really is a great studio (live) recording. Their are alot of repheats of songs like Dazed And Confused thats the only downfall other then that here is four stars.
B00005KHJR|5.0|I can't remember the first time I saw this film, but the next day I started a search for a print of it.<br />Edward Woodward stars as the almost unsympathetic, pious, and determined officer who matches wits with Christopher Lee, in a marvelous role of the smiling, ever-reasonable villianous island cult leader.  The entire community seems to be hiding the truth behind the disappearance of a young girl, even to the degree of at first denying her existence.  The very conservative Christian representative of the law has walked into the middle of a very Pagan circle; this conflict has to be resolved.  Initially, the audience may not be too sure who is playing with whom or why.  The climax of the suspense is a twist where the hunter becomes the sacrificial hunted.<br />Incredibly, the suspense of the plot does not wear off with repeated viewings, thanks to the production values (hats off to all those involved, shooting outdoor spring scenes in November on the coast of Scotland!) and outstanding performances of the cast.<br />I knew, when I saw it the first time, that the version I had seen of it had been cut down; however, even at the &quot;sliced salami&quot; level, it was an extraordinary experience - and experience is the word.  The film puts you right there in the midst of the puzzle.  Over the years I found various cuts of the film, eagerly awaiting what might be reconstructed. (The only other film I can recall searching for this diligently is a &quot;more complete&quot; cut of Fritz Lang's &quot;Metropolis.&quot;)<br />This special edition of &quot;The Wicker Man&quot; might well be as good as it gets. Certainly, the inclusion of the backstory of the film (&quot;The Enigma of The Wicker Man&quot;) added to both the theatrical and extended versions makes this particular release worth having.<br />If you haven't seen the film, make the chance.  It's not exactly horror, it's not exactly mystery - it's both.  And then some.  It's one of a kind. It's &quot;The Wicker Man.&quot;
0393316041|5.0|I can't see why so many idiots give Feynman's books bad reviews and say &quot;the guy is OVERRATED man!&quot;  These people are probably just jealous because Feynman was UNDOUBTEDLY the coolest smart-person who ever lived.  Moreover, this is the book which provides conclusive proof of that fact.  Anyone who says Feynman was overrated is blatantly wrong -- In fact, I have been interning at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Lab, where I met a man named Don Thompson who actually met Feynman when he did his post-doctoral work at Caltech.  As Don says, &quot;Feynman was just as funny, brilliant, and vibrant as all the books and accounts say he was.&quot;  So, buy this book, and don't believe all the idiots who give it bad reviews.
B0000A1WGH|5.0|Brilliant music, but DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY on this shortened American version. It is the same as the original German version and is missing five tracks from the vastly superior second European release, which has the complete score. (Except for one track that was taken from Tiersen's Amelie)    Why they stupidly chose the incomplete album for the American CD is beyond me, but you can find the 23 track complete European version for only a few dollars more in most stores, or find it here at Amazon.     On the cover, instead of the photo of the mother and son, the good version that you want will have just the title, in white and black text, on a red background.    On that page here at Amazon you'll find my review of the album, which includes the correct film order of the music, if you want to reedit it, as I did.
0440238609|5.0|As a big fan of Harry Potter and LOTR I was looking for more epic and wonderful fantasy to escape in when I found this series last year. <br />Skeptical at first I quickly read all three books. What was the verdict? I loved them and they became my all time favorite books and favorite series. Yes better than Harry Potter and LOTR. Why is this? The emotional value is intense. <br />I won't give away anything imprtant but at times I was sobbing at others cheering. These books really made a big emotional impact on me. With romance and adventure they seem the perfect series of books and they are. <br />Reading them as a preteen and a young teen now I could really identify with the main character Lyra and rejoice and cry with her. I couldn't, however, understand them at first. <br />How?, I thought could a fanasty book not have a happily-ever-after, not have a total resolution, not leave you feeling inspired and happy. <br />And as I read the three books I reliezed they were inspiring just because of that. Because they mirrored real life where everything doesn't work out and yet dwelled in the world of fantasy. <br />I highly reccomend these books for all fanatsy lovers. I guarentee you'll find yourself inspired and emotionally moved and perphaps find a new favorite fantasy series. Have fun reading the books!
B0001ZX0PG|3.0|Spoilers thar be!<br />I remember being hyped at seeing this film at the Edinburgh International Film Festival last year, as were a lot of other people. Then, for no known reason, Clint Eastwood cancelled and we were left to wait another six months for the film to be released nationwide.<br />Was it worth the wait. Well, while I've never doubted Eastwood's talents behind the camera (I really liked Absolute Power) there is just something in this film that fails to connect with me.<br />The story of three childhood friends (Penn, Robbins, Bacon) torn apart as adults after one of them is abducted is intriguing.<br />Penn is the thug father with a loathsome and heartless wife (Laura Linney), Robbin's is the meek and humble dad with a loving (but totally traitor) wife (Marcia Gay Harden) and Bacon is the investigating Cop who's wife has run away. All of them perform very well, especially Robbin's who has always struggled to shed his 'nice but dim' typecasting. And Eastwood's direction takes its time and builds the story at a deliberate, unrushed pace.<br />But as soon as Sean Penn's daughter is murdered I lost all sympathy for them. The story falls into darkness as suspicions and tensions mount. Every character gets what they deserve. I had no connection with Marcia Gay Harden at all and her panic and denial at the end is her own fault. Her character was the wife of Tim Robbins' for what appears to be over a decade, she simply would have known her husband wasn't a killer, should never have confided in Sean Penn. Tim Robbins is also to blame for telling lies about how he came home bleeding and shaken.<br />Sean Penn's character also gets what's coming to him (though it's a bit of a let-down we don't actually see it). He's a bad man and despite his brilliant acting and grief at the loss of his daughter, why on earth would I care about such a despicable man?<br />Basically, many horrors and tragedies could have been avoided in this story if people just told the truth. Fair enough, there wouldn't BE a story if that were so but the result is a film that I cannot engage with and in the end I just don't care.<br />The DVD is in great-looking 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen with Dolby 5.1 sound. There are 2 extra discs worth of features (one of them is a soundtrack CD) if you can't get enough. I've had my share of this movie. It may have much greatness to it, but I want no more.Fair enough, there wouldn't BE a story if that were so but the result is a film that I cannot engage with and in the end I just don't care.<br />The DVD is in great-looking 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen with Dolby 5.1 sound.

B0002DB0FO|5.0|this is a magical drama that gives you the feeling of curling up by the fire with a warm drink and a good book. the characters struggle through the undeniable hardship of losing the beloved mother of ephram and delia, julia brown. her husband andy, a workaholic doctor, is grief-stricken and makes a split-second decision to relocate the family from the bustle of new york city to a small town that julia had once seen when her train got delayed as a child. everwood, colorado brings the brown family into a small world complete with its own trials and tribulations. amy abbott's struggling with the injury of her comatose boyfriend, and yet somehow she and ephram collide, helping each other, and ultimately getting hurt. this is an amazingly intelligent, thought-provoking show unlike any other.
B00008OWZC|5.0|First off, I have no beef with The Song Remains The Same, so don't throw your copy of it away (contrary to what one reviewer said). But the title of my review basically says it, this 3-disc set and the 2 DVD set are the greatest Led Zeppelin releases ever, outside of the albums of course.  Both HTWWW and the DVD set capture Led Zeppelin at their finest.  Any Zep fan would love this collection beacuse you've got all of the classics (before 1973) here, and you get to hear versions of songs from their fifth straight great album (Houses of the Holy) before they were put on tape.  Now I think I need to address a few issues that other reviewers have brought up.  First of all, \\"Dazed and Confused\\" is NOT too long, the problem is that you all who say that have been raised in a world of 3 to 5 minute songs that are so full of hooks that there's no real music.  As a result, your attention spans aren't long enough to tolerate improvisation.  Same with \\"Moby Dick\\", you all just can't handle a song more than 5 minutes long.  Also, I see many comments that Jimmy Page's guitar playing was really sloppy.  Being a guitar player, I'd have to disagree.  It takes a lot of technical ability to play the guitar parts to Zeppelin songs (try looking at the tabs).  The audio quality is also pretty good considering its over 30 years old and the mixing is pretty good, there's nobody that's invisible in the mix.  As for my favorites, probably \\"Heartbreaker\\", \\"Black Dog\\", \\"Over The Hills...\\", \\"Since I've Been Loving You\\", \\"Stairway To Heaven\\", \\"That's The Way\\", \\"Dazed and Confused\\", \\"Moby Dick\\", \\"Whole Lotta Love\\" (gotta love the good old rock standards), and \\"Bring It On Home.\\"  I'm also happy to see that they've credited Willie Dixon on \\"Whole Lotta Love\\" and \\"Bring It On Home\\" (although I wasn't too upset that they didn't on the original album).  The great thing about this album is that it captures the sheer power of Zeppelin on stage.  If you haven't already...BUY THIS!  And while we're at it...BUY THE DVD!!<br />On a side note, someone said that Zeppelin made \\"arena rock\\" famous.  The problem is, Zeppelin wasn't arena rock.  Sure they played in big arenas, but arena rock was made by the likes of Genesis, Journey, Peter Frampton, all those people, whose music and lyrics were incredibly generic and had no real depth to them.  Can't say that about LZ, can you?
B00005JM20|2.0|The British try to hard to be funny in this movie.  While the storyline kept my interest, the humor was too juvenile for me.  I would not recommend purchasing this movie unless you get it for $4.00 or less. When the movie is over with you just feel like it was a waste of time.
B000002LEU|5.0|Joy Division are one of those bands that will always stay with me. Even though I was rather young when they were actually playing together, I  discovered them quite early on in my New Order obsession. That helped me to define both bands, their musical catalogs, as well as their place in my cd collection.<br />I am reviewing (and recommending) this record because if someone out there wants and introduction to Joy Division, they would be hard-pressed to get a better deal than the well-priced Substance LP. Sure, if you've got the dough go ahead and pony up for the beautifully realized box set (designed by Factory Records mainstay, Peter Saville).<br />Substance has all the singles that any American has probably heard on any good jukebox. Atmosphere, Love Will Tear Us Apart and She's Lost Control are all here and sound great for a 1988 release. You'll get a better recording on the box set versions, but that's your 60 bucks compared to your 11 bucks. The main draw of substance is, like the box set, the nice mix of tunes from the band's brief and brilliant time together. A task not as easliy done as one might think. Some of the best bits, are earlier, yet rougher tracks like, Warsaw. The band were finding their sound and making new incredible music all at the same time. Later songs, like Love Will Tear Us Apart, are far more polished, and a bit more accessible to the masses, but none-the-less, great. All in all, this is a great addition to any post-punk, brit-punk, alternative, indie music fans' collection. I give it my highest praise, and I think you might too.
0375703861|5.0|There have only been a few times when I come across a book that I have to tell everyone I know about, one that immediately pops into my head when someone asks &quot;Have you read anything good lately?&quot; White Teeth is such a novel. What an enjoyable, hilarious and exuberantly written work this is. Zadie Smith is a very talented writer and I look forward to reading her other stuff. The book opens with Archie Jones's failed attempt at suicide in London in 1975. This sounds serious, but Smith handles it with such wit and aplomb that the scene is hilarious. We follow Archie, his friend, Samad Iqbal as they marry, have children and watch their children grow up in a London they just don't understand. The characters are hilarious. Archie is completely clueless, but that doesn't bother him. Samad is a frustrated intellectual stuck being a waiter, trying desperately to validate an act of bravery of one of his ancestors. Their children come of age in the cultural and ethnic melting pot that is modern London. Smith's characters are all wonderfully unique and terrifically funny. This is dark humor at its best! I highly, highly recommend this novel. It lives up to, and surpasses, any of the hype you may have heard. Zadie Smith is a brilliant author. I cannot believe I waited this long to give this novel a whirl. As said earlier, this is novel is unforgettable.
B00003CXCT|1.0|Mr. Lucas is always talking about film preservation when it comes to classic hollywood movies, yet he keeps messing around with his own!  I bought this version, but i would've paid twice as much for the original versions.  Ruining a classic like star wars was not enough, now he has to ruin thx 1138 by goofing around with the cgi again.  At least with the Thx 1138 release though their offering both versions in a boxed set, like spieberg did with e.t.  Thank god for spielberg, if it was'nt for him god knows what lucas would have done with the indiana jones trilogy with cgi.  Years ago lucas talked about doing a special edition of raiders of the lost ark,  a nearly perfect and flawlessly edited film, with cgi.  For god's sake leave these good movies alone already.  I agree with Gary Kurtz lucas just lost the touch after empire strikes back.
B00007GZR5|4.0|This is a wonderful tale of death and love.  Robin Williams dies in a car crash and wakes up in heaven.  He sees his old dog and friends from his life that have died before him along with his two children that have died in a previous car accident.  Robin finds out he that his wife is having an impossible time of living without him.  She ends up committing suicide and then is sent ot hell.  The rest of the movie is Robin on his quest to find his wife in Hell.  The movie is stunning in detail and is truly beautiful to look at.  Cuba Gooding Jr. and Max Von Syndow give stellar performances as supporting actors in this film.  The DVD has the usual extras including a less than happy alternate ending.

B000148KK2|4.0|I too have written a negative review of a Diana Krall release, but it was one of the recent 'heavy on the strings / short on the trio / very short on good piano' CDs. I almost did not buy this CD because of the number of negative reviews on Amazon, but I'm very glad that I tried it anyway. Frankly, I hear none of the adulterating influences that many reviewers attribute to Mr. Elvis Costello. These songs, though they're not the jazz and torch classics that populated her previous albums, have a character and performance that typifies much of the rest of her work. Gone are the syrupy strings and orchestral accompaniments, the sparse piano work, and sublimation of the jazz trio interplay that made her earlier CDs so good. And if none of these songs are destined to become classics, most of them are very good. The title track is a beautiful, haunting song which I could not get out of my mind after the initial hearing. The covers of Temptation, Black Crow, and Stop This World are better than other recorded performances. The piano is up-front in most of these songs, and the arrangements are masterfully done. Of special note are the piano work in the title track and the spare and atmospheric use of the Hammond in Tom Waits' song. Mr. Costello wrote or co-wrote (with Diana) many of the lyrics of these songs, and they have come under especial vituperation in other reviews. Here, too, I disagree. After listening to and reading the lyrics of the original songs on this release, I find them to be far above the quality of lyrics encountered in most popular music, and if they lack the profundity of though inherent in some (rare) classic songs of the past, there's certainly nothing for the composers to be ashamed of. Indeed, many jazz standards have lyrics that aren't worthy of much consideration: Straighten Up and Fly Right, The Frim Fram Sauce, Broadway,...to name some from previous Diana Krall albums. All in all, I found this CD to be very enjoyable and of a quality similar to some of her previous works. To her credentials as a pianist and vocalist she displays solid strengths as a composer and lyricist. Much to my loss if I hadn't tried this....
B00000JPYQ|5.0|This has always been a classic UFO album, the band is in top form here. I have the vinyl album of Strangers in the Night. I am NO audiophile by any means, but I will say this: whatever they did to this Remastered Strangers in the Night CD, completely surpasses the vinyl in every way possible, and most of the other CDs I own. Why? I don't know. Quite frankly, this CD sounds as if it could have been recorded in 2004. I'm not exaggerating, it's that good. You can hear every single note clearly played by Schenker &amp; Mogg's vocals are very clear as well. The Bass &amp; Drums come through perfectly. I bought this CD several years ago now, and find I listen to it quite often. I would highly recommend this for anyone interested in UFO &amp; Michael Schenker's guitar work.
B0001IN07Q|5.0|Seldom do I write an opinion, but felt it necessary to do so this time. Having been fortunate to see Mr. Bublé in concert I am left in awe of his talent. This dvd presents fairly a snapshot of what he's about in concert, but it couldn't ever capture the magic he makes when you're sitting there just mesmerized. He is THAT amazing.<br />It seems he's always being compared to the late greats, which in itself is quite an endorsement of his gift. I suggest he will become the one that others are compared to. He's that good.....<BR>Yes, this is a good buy and an enjoyable substitute for Michael live!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I, as many others, had never heard of this series until my niece (age 37) told me about it recently.  I had put her onto Farscape several years ago, so she knew what I liked.  This is the BEST.  I lent my copies of the series to my son and his wife (age 27).  He watched the entire 14 episodes in one sitting.  His only complaint is that there are too many unanswered questions.  Somebody pay attention!  There is a huge base of people ready, willing and able to continue this journey with the Firefly family.  Thank you Josh Whedon for taking us where your wonderfully creative mind can go.
B000002GYR|5.0|If I could give 20 stars, I would - without a doubt, Waits' best work (yes, I'm getting on my stump). Tom's lyrics are easy, profound, and are shared with passion and ease.  Top props go to \\"Martha\\" - there is no concise way to capture the deep emotion of these lyrics and the lyrics on every song on this record.<br /><br />Thank you, Tom, for giving us the amazing songs on this record; in a loose way, you gave us the soundtrack to Bukowski's \\"You Get So Alone at Times...\\".  To all other Waits fans, or those checking out Tom for the first time, absolutely get this record.
0385510438|3.0|I absolutely loved The Summons, The King of Torts and The Partner, but this book was not like the others.  It's not a legal thriller but a history lesson about the South.  If you are interested in foods of the South and the Civil Rights movement, then this book is for you.  If you are expecting a legal thriller like previous John Grisham novels, look elsewhere-- you will be disappointed like I was!
B0000CABBW|5.0|Keisha Castle-Hughes was nominated for an Oscar for her role in this EXCELLENT film. Our family loved it. The story was enthralling, the filming and photography amazing and the introduction to Maori history and culture was fascinating. Our children (boys ages 13 to 11 and a girl age 10) all gave this film a thumbs up and we have added it to our family collection. <br />We also recommend The Road Home, a Chinese film from a couple of years ago on the same spectacular level as Whale Rider.

B0000648WZ|4.0|Early on, in my formative years, I was introduced to horror films by my mom. Our local late-night horror-fest was Creature Features, hosted by the immortal Bob Wilkins. Through this forum, I was exposed to the great Universal horror films of the 30's, the silly Japanese rubber-suit monster movies, and my favorites, the atomic-age big bug films of the 1950's. <br />Fast-forward to winter, 1997. I'm sitting in a theater watching Starship Troopers, and it feels like I've stepped into a time machine. This is possibly the best of all the big bug movies, and it's not afraid to show its roots. Sometime in the future, Earth is under attack by huge bugs from another planet. We follow the lives of a few of Earth's best and brightest, as they join the army and head off in different directions. What really struck me about this film is that they actually took the time to develop a three-dimensional world for the characters to inhabit. That's what makes the difference to me. Yes, the young actors are mostly pretty eye candy, and their performances, while not Oscar-caliber, are light years beyond their forebears of the 50's. The world of their future is seemingly fascistic (service in the military guarantees citizenship and other perks, such as the right to vote and the right to have children. Hmm - a future in which people's active participation in their country allows them greater freedoms, provided they take personal responsibility for themselves and their future? I've heard worse notions...). We follow the idealistic youths through basic training, all the way to several epic battles on other worlds and we see their progress as soldiers and as humans along the way. It's this kind of attention to detail and character development that sets this film apart from many others. And yes, everyone makes noise about the coed shower scene, but I have to say that is one of the more important scenes in the film. It shows that the cadets have grown as soldiers, that they are capable as seeing each others as parts of a team, instead of just a bunch of good-looking naked people. Those who have a problem with this scene - grow the heck up. It just adds to the sense of realism of the whole movie. Oh, yeah - there's the bugs, too...<br />As far as I'm concerned, the bugs are real. I don't know that I've ever seen the make-believe so realistically brought to life in any other movie. These are truly nasty creatures, devoid of compassion or humanity in every way. The effects work (courtesy of master Rob Bottin) is truly incredible. The beasts take apparent glee in tearing apart their human foes, and they do so in spectacular ways. The bugs are so magnificently realized that I literally found myself on the edge of my seat as the troops find themselves ambushed in a deserted fort, with the entire horizon blocked out by herds of thundering bugs. <br />Paul Veerhoven (Robocop, Total Recall) has a fanatical eye for detail, which is yet another aspect of this film that just compels the feeling that what is happening might just be real. He maintains a sense of humor throughout, which works brilliantly when contrasted to the raw, brutal carnage we're being subjected to. The primary actors, the pretty young kids, do the best they can within the limits of their youth and talent (the standout is Dina Meyer, who's just great), but the real stars of this movie are Clancy Brown as the quasi-sadistic Sergeant Zim, the cadet's Drill Instructor, and genre favorite Michael Ironside as Lt. Rasczak, the kids' teacher at home, and also out on the battlefield. These two guys deserve as much attention and credit as possible for always turning in great performances in character-driven roles. They, even more than the bugs, give this film its heart. <br />All in all, you just couldn't ask for a more fun Saturday afternoon monster movie. Just avoid any sequels, because invariably, they just can't live up to this fun, breathtaking achievement.
0452285186|4.0|Okay, maybe I'm sick, but I found this book really amusing.  Basically, it's a bunch of comics in which bunnies commit suicide in some really strange ways.  I'm sure everyone who's read this and liked it has their favorite few.  There seems to be a suicide theme for just about everyone - Star Trek, Star Wars, football, aliens, farming, and the Olympics, just to name a few.  One of the things that makes these comics so funny, I think, is the absolutely blank expression on the bunnies faces - every weird act of suicide just happens to be an everyday thing in their lives.  I can definitely see the price being a problem, for some, since this whole book can be read (&quot;looked through&quot; would actually be more accurate, since there are hardly any words to read - these comics mostly don't have captions, or any speaking) in a few minutes, although some of the suicides may take more time to decipher than others.  The really squeemish may also have problems with this book, since some of the comics show the &quot;after&quot; of the suicide attempt.  The comics aren't drawn realistically, so I wouldn't think that the &quot;afters&quot; would be too much of a problem with most people, especially the kind of people who would pick up a book with the words &quot;bunny&quot; and &quot;suicides&quot; in the title.  The title and covers should be warning enough, for those who might be offended by this kind of humor.  Anyway, if you don't mind the price and the length, you should get this book.  It's really very funny, and you can gross out your friends and family with it!
B00006JKLI|5.0|The reviewers below really hit it dead on:  this is not Yes' most cohesive or best album, but it still is one of the essential albums in any rock collection.  Every member of Yes is incredibly talented:  Jon Anderson's raspy voice sounds like two people singing at the same time; Chris Squire plays bass as if it was a lead instrument; Steve Howe's guitar at times rings with classical underpinnings and at other times rips out overwhelming lightning fast rock riffs; Wakeman's only peer on keyboards is Keith Emerson; and I suspect Bill Bruford is one of the few drummers who could possibly anchor this much talent.<br />Without reviewing the songs individually, the music is some of the most complex to be produced by a mainstream rock band with extended instrumental passages which paint great musical landscapes.  The lyrics are pure poetry, the meaning of which is not always ascertainable.  In a way this enhances the band in that it allows Jon Anderson's voice to be a musical instrument communicating pure emotion without the necessity of resorting to the meaning of the words he is voicing.<br />Amazingly, 30 years after this album was released, YES! can still fill the 2500 seat Universal Amputheater in Los Angeles, with seats going for an average of $... a pop.  That says a lot for the quality of the musicians and their compositions.  And that is why this album is essential to a music collection.<br />Why buy the DVD-Audio?<br />CDs are harsh and brittle.  They produce listening fatigue in minutes, and have always left me fiddling with the trebble in a feeble attempt correct the uncorrectable sound.  Nothing worked.  So, for serious music appreciation, I needed to resort to the long playing vinyl album.  These have their own problems such as limited dynamic range, transient distortion, poor pressing quality, tape hiss and noise, scratches and thousands of pops and ticks, rumble, wow and flutter, and expensive playback equipment which needed care and tuning.  And worst of all, I had to get up to flip the album half-way through!<br />DVD-Audio and SACDs fix these problems.  Initially, I put on the CD of Yes' &quot;Close to the Edge&quot; just to assure myself that CDs aren't for extended listening.  I then played the DVD-A and the vinyl of Fragile at the same time and flipped back and forth.  The stereo track on the DVD-A revealed instruments which were burried on the vinyl:  Steve Howe's guitar has a beautiful warmth to it which is missing on the vinyl -- the ring and sustain of the guitar notes at the beginning of Roundabout held on longer; the echo from the room in which Anderson was singing became more apparent; Wakeman's synthesizers sounded crystaline without harshness; and you could hear with clarity the wood of Bruford's sticks as they hit the rim of a drum.  The 5.1 track reveals even more, most notably in &quot;Cans and Brahms&quot; when Wakeman hits a deep bass organ peddle and the room vibrates.<br />A must have album.  If you have a DVD player, I also recommend Yes Live at the House of Blues and Keys to Ascension.
0060922583|5.0|The Holographic Universe is by far one of the best books quantum physics I've read. This book clearly presents a unified view of both science and spirituality. Their are many mystical concepts that the author touches upon. The idea of a Collective Unconscious; that we all share a deeper racial memory is reminiscent of the later works of Carl Jung.<br /><br />  In addition, there is a small but helpful chapter devoted to Multiplicity or multiple personalities. The author articulates a theory that multiples exist as a collection of individual souls that exist in parallel dimensions as well as our own. Physical differences are scientifically observed in different members of a multiple's system. A brain tumor is seen in the x-rays of a multiple patient. When the patient changes personalities, the brain tumor is no longer present.<br /><br />  I found his theories to be helpful and well thought out. For any student of psychology or self discovery, these ideas are are insightful and creative. There is a great deal we don't know and may never know. This book allows the reader the opportunity to go beyond their limited understanding of how their universe may exist.
B00020HEG6|5.0|This has got to be the best Harry Potter soundtrack ever! As a few other reviewers have said, Prisoner of Azkaban is one of the darkest of the books in the Harry Potter series and a lot of the songs really convey that well. <br />My favorite track is #6 Buckbeak's Flight. To me, it has this powerful sound to it and listening to it makes me feel peaceful. This song is played in the movie when Harry is flying on the Hippogriff Buckbeak for the first time. The entire scene is powerful (and made more so by the song) and I think it was a way for Harry to escape his troubles, if only for a few moments. In PoA, that is definitely something Harry needs.<br />I would usually give each track a rating and an explanation of why I gave it that certain rating, but it is currently three in the morning and I'm sleepy! Lol. Otherwise, I give each track the same rating, a 10/10, with the exception of track 6, which deserves an even higher rating! I can 99.9% guarantee that you will not regret purchasing this soundtrack!
B0001UL7RY|1.0|This is the **** folks! Avril sings in such a beautiful tone, but dosen't quite top her rival punk princesses, Britney Spears, Jessica Simpson, and Christina Ag. Come on people! Why listen to those unoriginal acts such as Madonna and t.A.T.u. when you can listen to this death metal!
0440236738|5.0|Wow,this book is amazing.the suspense and the many twists in the plot are shoking time after time.thsi is a Great great book! i start the reading in friday night and finish the book on saturday night.A little more than 24 hours...<BR>if you're looking for a great thriling non-stop twists book,this is the one for you.
630280082X|5.0|This movie was so great i give it 5 stars!  It's a well done and well written movie.  I would recommend it to anyone! I saw this with my dad, and we're big movie buffs and this is both our favorite! Ralph Macchio was really good, he couldn't have done ant better! I love this movie and would reccomend this!
B00004ZAV3|3.0|The only Beatles album that has more than 12 good songs on it.  Somewhat recommended.
B00006RG9K|5.0|What the hell is your problem?  Have you not realized that 'We Can't Dance' - the CD that went out during this tour - was the best selling album Genesis made?!? Where's the fifteen million people that bought 'Selling England By The Pound'?  Where's the ten million and more that bought 'Wind and Wuthering' instead of 'Invisible Touch'?  We're gonna have to agree to disagree becasue like I said before - Genesis has been a great band for three decades!!! IF Tony and Mike didn't like the way the PC had the band shift and mix genres, don't you think they would've left after '...And Then There Were Three'?  And obviously, you have to compose the music before you put it on a machine and in loops, retards.  And don't even try to say that Peter Gabriel never did and never has used loops on machines in his music.  Listen to his 'Hit' CD and you'll see a good amount of treatments and loops.  But anyway, Genesis ruled, with or without Peter Gabriel, and if you guys can't except the fact the PC, TB, and MR propelled the Genesis name for several years without Hackett and Gabriel, then you are all fools and don't know true music.
B000089RVX|1.0|Me and ma home girls get down to this every time we roll the clubs. That rap in \\"Bring Me to Life\\" is gangsta. And this cover is so bling-bling.
B0001AVZA8|3.0|I enjoyed watching the movie, but I will say that it was easy to predict, and too long.<BR>I am only 30 years old, and I don't think that romantic comedies are just for the younger crowd - HOWEVER - the nudity was uncalled for. Kind of gross.
0394818237|4.0|I, like many other readers, remember and enjoyed this book as a child.<BR>Now- with my own 3 year we are rediscovering the great pictures; the mechanics<BR>of how things work and are built and what people do all day. <br />This is where I think it needs some updating. As a historic record<BR>for the 1950's, it might be accurate. But what takes me one<BR>tick down in the rating in re-reading this to my son is the overt<BR>sexist roles. There are precisely 3 careers allowed for women in this<BR>book- homemaker, nurse and secretary. I've taken to changing some of<BR>the gender of the workers to make it a bit more realistic-<br />Don't get me wrong- the concept is great, the stories serve that<BR>purpose of how things work- and my son loves this book- I just<BR>get a bit tired trying not to perpetuate stereotpyes that didn't exist<BR>when I was a child in the 1960's (at least in my family).
B000002IST|5.0|Yes, you are entitled to your opinions and all, but I still think some of them are horrible.  'We Can't Dance' was Genesis's best selling album (15 million), so obviously close to that many people really enjoyed this one. All the songs are great, especially &quot;No Son of Mine&quot;, &quot;Never A Time&quot;, &quot;Dreaming While You Sleep&quot;, &quot;Way Of The World&quot;, and &quot;Fading Lights&quot;. Not to mention the fact that &quot;Hold On My Heart&quot; and &quot;Since I Lost You&quot; are two of the most beautiful and emotional love songs ever created. Peter Gabriel and Steve Hackett did have a very strong influence on Genesis's prog-rock era.  However, if you look at PG's solo career, you'll see that he also changed into a different person musically, evolving into a more worldly person than just rock. (Which I have nothing against him for.)  Nevertheless, all the machine loops (which came from acutal composing) and actual drums in this album proved to the world again that the then 40 year-olds still had it in them to produce a great album filled with deep stories, worldly issues, and great emotion.
B000063JDE|2.0|I saw Mulholland Dr, Dune, and Eraserhead,  and I was like &quot;wow, David Lynch is a pretty crazy dude, I'll see Blue Velvet since everybody seems to call it his masterpiece.&quot; Well, I found it to be much less than that. <br />One of the most common descriptions is &quot;deeply disturbing.&quot; Which part?? The only character that was remotely disturbing was Dennis Hopper, but that was it. &quot;The dark underworld of midwestern suburbia&quot;. Oh yeah? He sure does get into the &quot;dark underworld&quot;. Jeffrey gets driven in a car and punched in the face. Big deal. <br />The previous Lynch movies I saw really made you think. Trying to understand his movie plots in a logical fashion is futile, you have to think abstract. Well, not with this one. This movie just has a cliched murder/mystery plot with...a happy ending? What is this? This is not the Lynch I enjoy. <br />If you want a murder/mystery movie that really makes you think, see Mulholland Dr. That movie is incredible.
0671027387|5.0|I started reading Dan Brown's books with The Code. His previous book was D&amp;A, and it looked like a copy of the last. Then I read the Digital Fortress, and began to think Mr. Brown might be a one-trick pony. And then I read the Deception Point, and I am convinced he is a very good writer and am looking forward to his next book (whenever that might be.)<br />The story of the Deception Point keeps you guessing from the moment a Canadian is dropped off a helicopter to his death along with his sled dogs. All the way to a rather funny ending. At the crux of the story is a meteor, which may contain a rather surprising possibility. A smart lady, named Rachel, tries to get to the bottom of it all while trying to protect her dear life from the vicious and secretive Delta Force soldiers.<br />While a little bit more information about the Delta Force would have made the story more interesting, Dan Brown indeed writes like Michael Crichton, and there is nothing wrong with that!
6303022901|4.0|Plenty of people have pointed out the movie's good points but beyond the mother - daughter theme that is so wonderfully dealt with, this movie is also about the immigrant experience. In this world today, so many people immigrate and must contend with the difficult process of watching their children grow up in another culture - wonderful, different, distant, restive - and they have to figure out how to connect with their children. &quot;Joy Luck Club&quot; portrays this poignantly. How many children of refugees really have any idea what their parents went through? Many people from a variety of cultures will appreciate the film for that reason alone.<br />  As for those who say Tan is &quot;male-bashing&quot;, keep in mind the very loving character of June's father. Also, if you've read Tan's other books, (The Kitchen God's Wife, for example), there are both good and bad men with great depth of character.<br />  Let's remember, too, that history is not exactly littered with the stories of women, and Tan is just trying to rectify that imbalance. Having lived in Asia for 8 years, I'd say that male privilege is still alive and well...and in support of Tan's story, the (lack of) legal rights of women alone in pre-war China should illustrate the possiblity that four women might have had such experiences.
B00006879E|5.0|When Maroon 5 first made their debut in England earlier this year, I have to admit that I wasn't that impressed - which is probably because I didn't take much notice. My friends took to them, but I didn't see what all the fuss was about. Then they released their second single and it completely blew me away, but only after a certain amount of persuasion! I hadn't even heard the song until it debuted on the charts, but through massive radio airplay in my college room, I soon grew to love this band as did the rest of my fellow students.<br /><br />Maroon 5 are now one of the biggest success stories of 2004 with their awesome debut album \\"Songs About Jane.\\" I'm not sure when this album was first released, but I've heard it was around two years ago! I'm only sorry I didn't discover them sooner. The lead singer of the band is Adam Levine, whilst James Valentine plays guitar. Mickey Madden plays bass, Jesse Carmichael plays on keyboard, and the *stunningly gorgeous* Ryan Dusick plays on drums. He's a hottie and a half!<br /><br />The album opens with the first single \\"Harder To Breathe.\\" The beat opens quietly before a loud brash of those drums and the strumming of the guitars. The vocals are clear, precise and the panting behind the chorus is incredibly funky and sexy. The song is a whirlwind of rock and pop and ends before the third minute. A great song to open the album and a smash hit debut single. \\"This Love\\" was the second single from the album and made the band a multi-platinum smash hit all over the world. This has to be one of the most popular songs of the past year because it appeals to a mass audience. My young cousin loves this song, as do my parents and even my funky grandma! The chorus is the song's strongest point and will no doubt become anthemic in a year or so. \\"Shiver\\" is up next and has a stop-start chorus with some great lyrics. It's not an album highlight, however, and partially recalls a Justin Timberlake song, without the guitars! \\"She Will Be Loved\\" works in complete contrast to the previous song, and is definitely an album highlight! As the third single from the album, the song is a gorgeous mid-tempo ballad. If it weren't for Levine's passionate vocals and the powerful and beautiful lyrics, this would be just another song, but it isn't. The chorus is amazing and the bridges build this up perfectly.<br /><br />\\"Tangled\\" is another one of my favourites on the album. The song has a catchy and consistent verse arrangement which is preceded by a brilliant chorus, which appears to be the strong points for the boys in all aspects of their songs. \\"The Sun\\" is another favourite of mine on the album because of the vocal arrangement more than anything. Levine's vocals are on fine form as before, but this time the guitars play a larger role. The chorus is, once more, the strongest point of the composition, particularly towards the end. \\"Must Get Out\\" begins very strangely with soft and gentle guitar strumming and a background keyboard, before Levine makes his presence known with the opening line, \\"I've been the needle and the thread. Weaving figure eights and circles round your head.\\" The vocal arrangement is great and very catchy and the way Levine's vocals rise and fall in the chorus makes the song so memorable. \\"Sunday Morning\\" is one of those rare songs that lives up to its title. You could definitely listen to this on a Sunday morning and feel refreshed after a night out. It's probably the album's best feel-good anthem. By mixing rock with soul and a tinge of gospel (with the clapping), the boys create a great and unique song that will appeal to many who encounter it.<br />\\"Secret\\" is seen by many to be the best song on the album, and I have to agree that it's definitely up there somewhere. The song takes 95 seconds before any singing, building up brilliantly with a stunning introduction. It's a song about driving down a desert road in the middle of nowhere, but with more focus on a relationship that has cannot begin. Secrets are the main topic here with an overwhelming sense of ambiguity, and I love it! \\"Through You\\" is another great mid-tempo song about the breakdown of a relationship. Despite the song being good, you get the feeling that the whole 'I Hate My Ex' theme is a bit overdone by now. \\"Not Coming Home\\" was performed live, or so it seems. With an enthusiastic audience, the band bring something to the album that was lacking. Levine's vocals are as strong live as they are on the rest of the studio-sung album, which is something usually rare from most singers. The album closes with \\"Sweetest Goodbye,\\" which is a perfect closer to the album. This is definitely not the strongest song on the album and is probably a little forgettable because it's placed last on the album, but then again, you really connect with it when you're listening.<br /><br />OVERALL GRADE: 9/10<br /><br />This year has produced some really cool music that I've connected with to extremely well. I love exploring different styles and finding out what other music I will love. It's called expanding one's horizons, and I feel that with artists such as Maroon 5 I have done this! I've bought more than 25 albums this year and I'd definitely say that Songs About Jane is in my Top 10! This album has been a success because these boys actually have talent and produce some amazing music that appeals to a wide audience - they also happen to be rather sexy, especially Adam and Ryan! I'd recommend this album to anyone with an eye for exciting and fun-loving music.ets are the main topic here with an overwhelming sense of ambiguity, and I love it! \\"Through You\\" is another great mid-tempo song about the breakdown of a relationship.

1400032717|5.0|Some books open your eyes to new worlds. They expand your understanding of what's possible, and in so doing, teach you something about yourself. This is such a book.<br />Forget that high-falutin' talk, though. This book is a funny page-turner that will keep your interest page after page. It reads fast, perfect for taking on a plane ride. That's where I read it, after picking it up at an airport bookstore, and I arrived at my destination before I knew it.
B00006J9OT|5.0|I was introduced to Diana Krall when a friend of mine recommended &quot;Love Scenes,&quot; and I have been hooked on Diana's laid-back, slick, vaguely retro voice ever since.  &quot;Live in Paris&quot; is by far my favorite of her albums.  While the DVD features several more songs than does this CD--&quot;Pick Yourself Up&quot; and &quot;All or Nothing&quot; come to mind--the CD is still perfect for setting a causal, intimate vibe (during car trips, get-togethers, or quiet evenings at home with a good book and a glass of wine).  In fact, the range of moods Diana sets with her smoldering voice make &quot;Live in Paris&quot; appropriate for a variety of occasions; &quot;I Love Being Here With You&quot; features a lively, hopping rhythm section, &quot;East of the Sun&quot; is playful swing, and Diana's cover of Joni Mitchell's &quot;A Case of You&quot; is given a new, meloncholic texture with her deep voice and tinkling piano work.  <br />The charm of &quot;Live in Paris&quot; does not lie in the touch-ups of any producers, but in the subtle performance Diana gives, along with the tight-as-clockwork jazz ensemble backing her up.  This is a disc that can be played for years and still sound fresh.  Fans of Norah Jones; Harry Connick, Jr.; or Natalie Cole will surely enjoy this treat, as will any lover of well-crafted music with a jazzy bend.

B000001DWG|3.0|I never was a huge grunge mark, though I am a huge fan of Pearl Jam, Mudhoney and Soundgarden. But after hearing so much about this band I was led to think it was even better then Pearl Jam and this was the beginning of grunge music. My result was a bit dissapointing but this was an interesting listen. My first compliant is the vocals by Andrew Wood. I've never seen any interviews/music videos (Stardog Champion I saw a few years ago) so I don't know too much about his flamboyant style. His vocals were kinda high pitched at the first listen, but they do grow on you real fast. The music is really glamish and 80's sounding. Namely like Guns n Roses but with a harsher edge.<br />The sound isn't the harsh, hard and downright cynical grunge sound like Mudhoney or even Nirvana. Nor the clean but still cynical sounds like Pearl Jam or Alice in Chains. It's a cross between what Pearl Jam would sound like if it was crossed with the late 80's cockrock sound. The real standout song to me on the album would be Crown of Thorns. The piano start to the calm middle and the crashing end make it one of the best songs I've ever heard. The use of glam sounding drum work mixed with offbeat guitaring was really cool to hear - until Andy started singing that is.... But some of this album really shined to me, but the other stuff never grew on me, nor even appealed to me. But still if you Do in fact buy this album be on the listen for the tunes Stargazer, Bone China, Crown of Thorns, Stardog Champion, Gentle Groove and Heartshine. They really have a good sound to them and to me was worth listening to what others call music history. <br />Andy Wood would later die of a drug overdose, and Chris Cornell of Soundgarden would form a supergroup and release one of my favorite albums ever... But that's another review.<br />Recommended for grunge die-hards.<BR>Mildly recommended for (metal/hard/glam) rock fans.
B0001Z363W|5.0|Zakk Wylde rules - period. He is a musical genious and incredible songwriter. He keeps his albums interesting by changing each one - some mellow stuff and some bone crushing stuff. Every cd Zakk has released has been awesome... I give a slight edge to Pride &amp; Glory and Book of Shadows (two of the best CD's ever made on this planet since the beginning of time) but I love every BLS album as well. As for Hangover Music... it took me a couple of listening sessions to really appreciate it, but now it's among my favorites. To all the negative reviewers out there - did you give it a fair chance and listen to it more than once? Were you expecting another super-heavy skull crushing CD? Believe me, I like that style of music also - always have. But it's refreshing to hear something different... especially from the same artist. Do you want every CD to sound the same? I personally do not - I won't buy them if they all sound the same... I'll just buy one and call it good. Also, check on some of these people other reviews. One idiot gave 5 stars to two Marilyn Manson CD's... oh yeah - that's some music with great talent there. Zakk has more talent in his pinky finger than that entire band. Dude probably hates Pink Floyd too... what a closed-minded loser. Looks like he did a copy and paste on this and the Blessed Hellride review... wow, too stupid to even write a different review - impressive. Anyway, open your mind - If you are a fan of real music that contains talent and excellent songwriting (along with giving it a chance and realizing that it's different) - you will love this CD.
0451204530|4.0|There's one great strength of Follett's that some reviewers here don't mention. How do you get any better than with this opening line: \\"He woke up scared?\\" Are you compelled to read on? I certainly was. By the end, I enjoyed \\"Code to Zero\\" far more than \\"Jackdaws\\" whose characters seemed over-the-wall, though true life is often stranger than fiction so his motley WWII gang of women and homosexual spies may have been more realistic than we would assume. The only thing that stretched my disbelief in this novel was the speed in which the hero and NASA scientist recovered his memory as the 'clues' unlocked his drug-induced blocks. The good news is it has inspired me to read more about this amnesiac condition to find out if it could be so easily bypassed. There is no doubt Follet's masterful story telling talents are as gripping as ever even when readers complain about his treatment.

(spoiler) There is a scene where the gigilo android discovers that a woman has been murdered and goes on the run because he's afraid he will be accused of the crime. Three problems here: 1. The android surely must be programmed not to hurt humans, and if so, that will be determinable by examining his programming.  2. Even if he wasn't programmed not to, there surely must be a way to &quot;replay&quot; his activity- to view his memory.  Hell, with today's technology you could store a month's worth of video on a microdrive that's the size of your finger.  Surely anyone who designs an android will make it record at least the last 24 hours of what it's seen. 3. An android maker would surely not allow it the ability to go &quot;on the run&quot;.  Rather, it would &quot;return home if there's trouble&quot;.<br />4. (spoiler) Finally, the movie ends with the pinnacle of absurdity, a ludicrous creme de la creme.  The android boy is revived after a few thousand years and androids of the future are able to glean information from within the molecules of him. That by itself is not so bad, sure, I can believe such a technology could exist.  Maybe.<br />But the information only lasts 24 hours.  Seriously, I'm not kidding, that's what happens. The information &quot;lasts 24 hours and is gone forever&quot;.<br />I laughed so hard that an usher came over to me. One other guy was laughing too a few rows over.<br />5. Finally, the film is entirely about the boy's relationship with his adopted mom. That's fine, but what about the importance of loving the father?  The dad is just an incidental character. I can understand wanting to &quot;focus&quot; on the mother, but the fact that the film doesn't even see it as a PROBLEM to address somewhere, that seeking love from the father is totally ignored, demonstrates poor writing. Unethical.o me. One other guy was laughing too a few rows over.  <br />5. Finally, the film is entirely about the boy's relationship with his adopted mom.

0066620996|4.0|Collin's effectively distills an enormous amount of data to pinpoint the qualities of leaders and organizations that enabled them to make the jump from being just &quot;good&quot; to becoming truly &quot;great&quot; for a sustainable time.  Although the average reader will not likely be in the position to guide a publicly traded company to success, he or she will be able to take in the information contained in Good to Great and perform more &quot;in sync&quot; with what the great leaders have taught us.  Many of the lessons learned are somewhat counterintuitive ... the sooner one reads it, the better off he'll be.
B0000047CX|5.0|Have owned two vinyl copies of this album. Wore out the first copy. Will probably buy the CD. I can't add too much to the previous reviews but let me add two words, 'Timeless &amp; Elegant.'
B000000WCV|5.0|If you ever want to return to the old days when the scene used to be about music and nothing more, when all that matter was the vibe, then this is the cd to have for your collection. It will take you back to the days of old. Nothing beats this cd. They are the original house of house music.
B0001MDP3G|5.0|&quot;Cold Mountain&quot; is a great movie in many respects, but I don't think many people understand the point of it, which is the romance between Inman(Jude Law) and Ada(Nicole Kidman). People complain that the movie keeps them apart for too long when they didn't have much of a real relationship to begin with, which to them, makes the movie seem pointless. The point of their romance is clear because there are tons of times it's spelled out in the movie. What is the point? It's that in their brief moments together, Ada and Inman shared a lifetime's worth of feelings because they loved each other so much and I guess people can't relate to it. In a time where both characters had little, they could count on their feelings. It sounds corny, but it's good.<br />Besides that, &quot;Cold Mountain&quot; is great because it shows the underbelly of the Civil War, which is seldom seen in films. It makes the viewer see more of the whole picture rather than just battle scenes, although Petersburg is captured well to my knowledge in the beginning of the movie. All the acting is also great, although I could have seen other actors playing Inman, though. Jack White even almost makes up for his band with his screen time. So all in all, &quot;Cold Mountain&quot; is a great film and should have gotten more Oscars.
B0002234LS|2.0|This movie is somewhat entertaining, for the first hour. The viewer gets a little frightened and questions &quot;Who is this creepy guy who is claiming that Johnny Depp stole his story?&quot; But once you find out the ending, you just might want to run back to amazon.com in a rage and return the movie. Their are plenty of other movies that are much better. Do not waste your time or money on &quot;Secret Window&quot;. It disappoints.
B00005JMUA|4.0|this is a great movie, answeres a lot of questions, and FINALLY reveals the name of the hero.<br />Quentin tarantino really isn't a good film maker at all, a great film maker would have told the story in order (except the pai mei scene - great flashback) - wouldn't have showed the wedding scene, would have told us the heroine's name, and wouldn't have played that godawful music.<br />BUT, with all those flaws in mind, the movie was a great one.  the fight scenes, the dialog, I can't wait for this to hit DVD.
B0001ZX0PG|1.0|I own the film, and found it to be trite and obsessed with psychology.<BR>Clint Eastwood should know better than that, that's why I am surprised at him.
B00008H2LB|1.0|I am ashamed to have brought this album last year but now I have come to my senses and see it for what it really is.  It has no talent whatsoever, they sing about jack all and boring things, and one more low point about this is that it is so commercial and trendy and over-rated.  One of the worst albums ever I'd say.  Trust me do avoid this album, but I admit I did like their earlier stuff when it first came out which was exceptional back then, but to be honest I couldn't give one f*** about them these days.  I hate meteora so much so, that I wish and plan to sell it.  You want decent metal try Rage Against The Machine and Papa Roach, they are the only bands who wrote decent and talented stuff and they were barely commercial at all.  Linkin Park insult the music industry and other decent bands suffer because of commercialism on Rock music channels.
B000066NW0|1.0|Here are the facts:<br />She doesn't write her own music. A team of professionals is commissioned by the record label to compose the music for her.<br />She doesn't play an instrument. She is obviously faking her guitar playing on stage, because the chords and rhythms she is strumming don't even match the songs she's singing.<br />She can't sing. I've heard her perform live and she sounded really lousy--completely out of tune and harsh. On her albums, the record company has obviously corrected her bad singing using hi-tech computer programs to cover up her totally inadequate voice.<br />There are so many real musicians and songwriters out there. Don't waste your money on this phony.
B00005JMEW|4.0|Quentin tarantino has been making some very twisted and horrible films in his past, Jackie Brown, Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs, but it looks like he's making an attempt to REDEEM himself!<br />this time he made his first great movie!<br />Only problems with this movie are<br />-it's out of order<BR>-they bleep out the heros name - BAD MOVE, it's annoying<BR>-too much anime in the O-ren scene<BR>-the MUSIC!  the 5678's, the music from one of hip-hops worst producers &quot;the RZA&quot;, tarantino needs to open his eyes and realize this is the 21st century, not the 1970's!
B0000039PW|4.0|The album that brought attention to the east cost, and it's a <BR>powerfull album filled with hardcore tracks but also equipped with some cathcy radie friendly singles like \\"juicy\\" \\"big poppa\\", to this day \\"ready to die\\" is considered one of the best hardcore albums to ever be released and it's surly one of the best NY rap albums, However there are some sex tracks and skits are not really needed.<br />Production: beats 10/10 ...........lyrics 8.5/10<BR>Favorite tracks: Juicy, warning, machine gun funk.
B00005Y228|4.0|This cd is a preety good dance disc. It hits all the things that make a good dance cd, but thats as far as it goes. If your looking for something that has a bit more, then you might want to look elsewhere, but if you want a good dance disc look no further.
0385336810|5.0|I've read Kinsella's Shopaholic books and I know I'm not alone when I say they're hilariously written. Can You Keep A Secret is no different. I couldn't put this book down at all, I read it in a matter of two hours. I found myself laughing out loud more times than I could count, and even the Shopaholic series didn't do that for me. The hilarity scale in this novel was set higher than the romance scale though, obviously. I'm also a reader of romance novels so I didn't feel as though the romance between Emma and Jack is really developed, but I got too caught up in laughing to notice. All in all, a great read whenever you need some laughs.
B0001UL7RY|4.0|I thought Avril's first album was a refreshing change of pace from the oversaturation of pop princesses we were suffering from at the time of its release.  I liked 'Complicated,' and loved 'I'm With You.'  With this new second release, Avril doesn't stray from the formula of the first CD.  She goes at it again, but this time with a bit more finesse.<br />Fans will be glad to know that she hasn't abandoned the style she worked in the first release.  She's remained relatively unchanged, as a matter of fact, except that she's become a bit more sophisticated with her songwriting.<br />Unlike Dido's sophomore release, which was a bit redundant, Avril manages to maintain the same feel and vibe without sacrificing ingenuity.  It manages to stay fresh without too much change.<br />This album could easily be titled, &quot;Let Go: The Sequel.&quot;  The first single, 'Don't Tell Me' sounds like it could be the sequel to 'Complicated,' and 'My Happy Ending' sounds like the flip side to 'I'm With You.'  I'm not asserting that Avril wrote and recorded the new songs to be follow-ups to any of her older stuff.  The songs are undeniably written by the Avril we got to know from 'Let Go,' but this time with a few more life experiences under her belt, it seems.<br />Avril's fans should be pleased that she's remained relatively unchanged.  Older fans will be glad to know that despite this, she's still managed to grow.
B00005JMFQ|1.0|although there are some usually great name stars in this movie,it was too confusing with the switching back and forth from one couple to another among the 8. Also, a comment made to the widower about needing to stop crying or he would never get laid was disgusting plus other crude remarks; and be warned of one couple portraying porno actors. They actually rented  this film for my nursing-home patients to watch not knowing the adult content!
B000148KK2|5.0|I don't know what the fuss is all about.<br />After reading all the negative reviews I was really fearful of buying this CD.<br />It happened to be among Diana's best! (Together with All For You, and Love Scenes)<br />She steers away from the &quot;Elevator Music&quot; tendencies found in her latest CD's and comes back to the moody, piano-rich ambiance of the albums that made her famous.<br />I don't particularly like Elvis Costello, but if it was his influence that made her come back to her roots then I'm more than ready to enjoy more of their collaborations.<br />H.
